Because someone seems good at something excuses criminal behavior through systematic harassment, intimidation, threats and attempted endangerment the lives of others?  I think not.  We should forget because of the slap on the wrist in San Quentin?  I doubt it.  But you would let him off the hook and forget about it, it&#x27;s unimportant.  Riight.

However, the controller of a SD-card is for understandable reasons not as advanced as one on an SSD. One of the issues that seemed prevalent of the Pi was that SD-cards, when issuing a TRIM command, just erases the flash - immediately. Which of course kind of defeats the purpose and leads to bad performance (trying to optimize for future writes by sacrificing current writes).<p>The recommendation that I saw was to schedule a pass clearing free space for when the Pi wasn&#x27;t in active use.<p>Problem with the controller doing some of the stuff (which I guess is inevitable due to different design needs) and the file system doing some other stuff is that when the filesystem is paired with a bad controller (but one that still does some kind of wear leveling) you are kind of screwed anyway, because either implementation can not rely on the other. 
So, just use an SSD instead?<p>I guess it&#x27;s worse on the Pi since it&#x27;s somewhat trying to be a workstation on mobile hardware. And sometimes I get the impression that even phone makers can&#x27;t tailor it well anyway (samsungs android filesystem for the older phones were apparently pretty awful for instance). And android only got TRIM support in, I believe, Kitkat? But only if the whole chain of device hardware and drivers supported it (so god knows which current devices actually support it)... Learning that was quite shocking to me and probably a large source of &quot;my phone just keeps getting slower&quot; problems. But who cares if it just accelerates sales of new phones?",1441478257

I see you&#x27;ve pivoted/changed it around it bit over the last 2-3 months, so that makes it harder. Here&#x27;s a three-step exercise that might help:<p>(1). What did you feel was cool about your basic idea (which seems to be to &quot;wrap docker and kubernetics for easy microservice deployment in the cloud&quot;)? i.e. what excited you, what&#x27;s really cool, about the <i>technology</i> idea, the original technological impetus?<p>(2). What benefit would other people feel, if they were completely ignorant and had never heard of docker or kubernetics or heroku etc? i.e. aiming here at the <i>basic</i> benefit. To illustrate, &quot;easier to use than kubernetics&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean anything to someone who&#x27;s never heard of kubernetics or its difficulties. (Many enterprise customers would be in exactly this perfect state of ignorance - they have enough to deal with with their actual domain!)<p>It wouldn&#x27;t hurt to also consider what benefit that get from cloud hosting (assume they&#x27;d never heard of it, as unlikely as that is). Think of yourself as not converting fellow experts from other technologies, but as gaining adherents for the first time - they don&#x27;t actually want <i>your</i> tech. They want the cloud and you are just the ladder.<p>(3). Finally, think about target users again, now not as completely ignorant, but in terms of and their current situation: their needs (what their bosses/customers need), their plans, how they presently do things, and especially what technologies they have actually heard of and basically know what they are. [ for example, I&#x27;ve heard of the cloud and docker, but I don&#x27;t really know what the big deal about docker is. I&#x27;ve heard &quot;kubernetics&quot;, but I don&#x27;t know what it is. ]  Now craft a message that speaks to these people, given their present situation and perspective.<p>There will actually be several different target customers, with different situations and knowledge, that would require different messages to really speak to them.<p>For example, I&#x27;d like a really simple way to write a bit of code and get it hosted in the cloud, for free, to make a simple webservice (or website). It seems it could be (should be) simple, but it isn&#x27;t. That would be sensational! And great publicity for paid users (freemium, as you&#x27;re already using).",1441477520

Australia has had historically high amounts of TV piracy because Australia tends to get treated poorly. One of the country&#x27;s largest ISPs admitted over half of traffic was BitTorrent [1].<p>I live in the US now. I don&#x27;t have cable TV but I do pay for Netflix and HBO Now and will probably pay for the ad-free Hulu Plus now that it exists (I&#x27;d never pay for an ad-supported streaming service) and, what the hell, probably Showtime too. In part because I watch them but I don&#x27;t really need all of them. I really want to put my money where my mouth is here and support such services.<p>I often now see novels on Amazon where the paperback is $8 for a book that&#x27;s been out for years. The ebook is... $10.<p>Now in the case of print media like the NY Times and the WSJ, I get why they prefer the physical copy: it comes down to advertising. Advertisers will still pay more for print ads and certain advertisers will only buy print ads so they have to print physical copies a bunch of people won&#x27;t read. It&#x27;s why, just now in going to this page, you see the WSJ advertising print + online access and why print + online is usually cheaper than just online.<p>But I don&#x27;t get this at all with ebooks. Paper books need to be typeset and printed, supplies for that bought and the physical products need to be boxed and shipped to various distributors and so on. The distributor, printer and retailer all need to take cuts.<p>The ebook is essentially direct to market with zero distribution costs.<p>Now ebooks offer a lot of advantages to the consumer: immediate access, searchability, more portable. But they also come with negatives: you can&#x27;t as a general rule resell or even give away an ebook so it can only generally be read by the buyer and their immediate family.<p>Publishers should be loving this because publishers hate the preowned book market. It&#x27;s why textbooks are often changed from year to year: just to devalue used previous editions and force students to buy new books.<p>Yet publishers are acting in a way that strongly suggests they just want to kill the ebook market. Could that be it? They just know how to print and sell paper books and want to keep on doing it? Could it be fear of piracy and the inability to adapt to this new business model?<p>My own sense of fairness kicks in here: when I see a $10 ebook for an $8 paper book I just don&#x27;t buy either.<p>I&#x27;m reminded here of the cable TV industry. Cable TV is dying. It&#x27;s why cable companies will essentially give you free Internet if you subscribe to TV services (and charge you $50-80/month if you don&#x27;t). This artificially props up the number of TV subscribers, which is important because the price of content is driven by the number of consumers. The more consumers a provider has, the lower the pre-consumer cost of channels. This is also why Comcast was so desperate to merge with TWC and has since merged with Dish: to reduce content costs and increase their negotiating power with content providers.<p>But all of this is just seeking higher land in a flood: eventually you run out of land anyway so you&#x27;re just delaying the inevitable.<p>We see the same thing in the music, TV and movie industries where direct-to-market versions are often more expensive than, say, buying a CD or DVD and having it shipped to your house.<p>Perhaps this really is the long game of setting price expectations.<p>Piracy seems to be the response of the market to &quot;unfair&quot; pricing and licensing practices and it does seem to eventually force change. The problem is that once you&#x27;ve taught a whole market to be pirates, only some of them will switch back to more legitimate channels.<p>It still astounds me that you can be forced to watch FBI disclaimers and the like on movies you legitimately buy and have incompatibilities that won&#x27;t allow you to watch HD content (HDCP versions and the like) yet what has none of those problems is pirated content. It&#x27;s a wholly better user experience.<p>I really wish these old world industries would just accept we live in a digital world and get over their anachronistic business models.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.itnews.com.au/news/day-13-iinet-ceo-says-bittorrent-dominates-traffic-159742"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itnews.com.au/news/day-13-iinet-ceo-says-bittorre...</a>",1441477472

That said, I&#x27;m bad at security. I just don&#x27;t know enough about it, so I can&#x27;t put up much of a fight.<p>* Bandwidth use: I&#x27;d actually be really interested to see some research on this.

I was going to post the same thing: that the finite version solves this problem completely.<p>The only case where economics cannot avoid dealing with infinite quantities, is with dynamic issues, since most models assume that various quantities though finite at a given point, could grow without bound (e.g. GDP).  One case this comes up is in debt, especially national debt.  Most models posit a transversality/&quot;no ponzi&quot; condition, that states that the present value of debt at time t will converge to zero as t goes to infinity.  On the other hand, if national debt was a constant proportion of GDP (which in the long run should grow at the same rate as the risk free interest rate) then this would in fact be false, and national debt is a kind of free money that comes out of nowhere, i.e. a real ponzi scheme.<p>Imposing a finiteness condition (e.g. and end to the universe) would imply that in the far future, some generation will pay for current consumption that is based on either national debt, or the corresponding internal borrowing from future generations (e.g. social security as understood in the overlapping generations model).

I got thrown into the K12 system in 9th grade from a German school, had a relatively weak academic track record before that, and the school was a private school looking to churn students into the Ivys. The 3 years I spent there were hugely eye opening in regards to what I could or could not do with my life, but ultimately, it was not the right place for me.<p>But for my brother, it&#x27;s a little different. He was kicked out of a public school for altercations with another student, and I would say that the situation was not handled in a fair manner. The school claimed that the reason for the suspension was that the other parents didn&#x27;t feel safe sending their children to the school anymore, which was bogus since my mother actually went and personally called every single parent in the grade. None of them had any concerns over the incident. I&#x27;m suspecting that the school was simply overly cautious since about 20 years ago one student (one of the pastors children) murdered another student by stabbing him on a staircase inside of the school building. Whilst I don&#x27;t fault the school administration for overreacting and deciding to deal with the problem through sweeping it under the rug, I do think the issue could have been handled more gracefully than sending a 12 year old for police questioning AND a psychologist.<p>Also I was not making a point about whether my or my brothers expulsion was justified, I was commenting about the effects of expulsion, and how variable they can be depending on the student and their upbringing.<p>I believe that public school systems should act as an equalizer against how you&#x27;re raised at home instead of compounding these problems.",1441476740

If you want leverage, you get another internship offer and ask for a higher rate; you walk if you do not get what you want.<p>Realise that as an intern, your negotiating power is limited. Focus on what you can learn, and if it is a good company, whether you can turn your internship into a full-time position. Take these two factors into account and choose the company that is the best in this regard --- any increase in the hourly pay rate will pale in comparison to the upward arc you will put yourself on if you optimise for the two factors I have mentioned.",1441476554
10175522,comment,10175351,10175439,0,0,midwestdev,,,"Thanks for the feedback!<p>1) While I can&#x27;t be sure, I believe that I would be able to be seen as capable.  I consider myself a strong mobile developer, and I have many years of shipping some very popular apps.  It is my understanding that the remote mobile team is somewhat more on the junior side.  If I made changes to the team (introduce formal code review, spin up build servers and nightly/CI builds, etc) it would be done gradually and with their input.<p>2) This is basically what I was thinking.  If they don&#x27;t budge on vacation, or are unwilling to even consider it, it isn&#x27;t a good sign.<p>3) Their rationale has been that while yes, the mobile team is in another city, part of my role in this position is somewhat of a liaison between the mobile team and the rest of the IT in my current city.  As new features are requested of the app that have service dependencies, it would require me to interface with the team in my city.  Still though, IMO, this doesn&#x27;t require 5 days a week face to face.  I&#x27;ve never had problems doing this in my current role.  I honestly just think this comes down to the company here not being used to people regularly WFH.  When I first joined my current company, it wasn&#x27;t an option at all, but it was added a year after I joined.<p>4) Commute does worry me some.  Although, I know many people with MUCH longer commutes.  I think that ~40 minute commute is on the max of what I would consider bearable.  This commute falls under that.  Although, another consideration is that this job is further away from my child&#x27;s daycare.  So, on certain days, my effective commute may be longer still.<p>5) I feel like I&#x27;m listened to and that I am relevant.  At most places I have worked, I feel like I have the respect of my peers and management.  I work very hard.  But in the past 2 years, I have spun up 2 completely new, relatively large apps for my current company.  Once they are released, the development cycle seems to slow a lot.  The number of new features that need to be developed go way down.  I&#x27;m in one of those maintenance modes now and can lead to me being bored.",1441476531

There aren&#x27;t that many use cases that require nullability of a reference and there are many cases where the forced nullability bites you.<p>Unfortunately adding it to C# now will mean that either the language breaks or the feature will be an add-on that isn&#x27;t as powerful as it should be (like in Swift, where it&#x27;s really the base for everything).<p>Personally I would say that a reference type can be declared explicitly non-nullable with an exclamation mark (!) and if they&#x27;re properties they either should have a default value or they should be set while the class is constructed.",1441476394

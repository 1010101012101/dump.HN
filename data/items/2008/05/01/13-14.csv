178405,comment,178279,178279,0,0,bigtoga,,,"| my stake will be protected from dilution at all stages.<p>So you are being given preferred stock? That's the only stock that I can think of that would prevent dilution during later stages. I find it difficult to believe that a <i>smart</i> startup company that would give out preferred stock to employees. I also can't imagine VCs/angels who would invest in a company that had just given preferred stock to a ""Legal and compliance director"" (no offense but that title isn't necessarily thought of in terms of bringing revenue in as highly as a developer or salesperson).<p>A 2% stake could easily get chopped down to 1% or .5% on liquidation due to various means. Assuming a five year growth-to-liquidation, does 1% of a $100m sale ($1m) justify taking no salary for 2-3 years and then a below-marketing salary for the remaining time? Balance that with the risk that the startup may fail, not raise as much money as they thought, etc...<p>A least two key factors you need to think about are (1) what you expect the company to get acquired for, and (2) when you expect to be acquired. A $10m sale in year 1 means you get $50k-$100k (being optimistic) for one year of work. A $10m sale in year 3 means you get $50-$100k for three years.",1209650237

It's built into git, and it lets you use git with your office's svn repository.<p>You do have to accept some constraints in order to use it successfully -- basically, git-svn doesn't seem to understand merging back-and-forth between different branches very well, so it encourages a much more linear, one-branch workflow than git does -- but it is still a huge improvement over stock svn, and it lets you inch your way into git, and gives you a platform from which you can lure your fellow employees into git one at a time.",1209649851

The usual behaviour is that he has one great insight, a bunch of entertaining ranting, and one egocentric point. And on the basis of this, the whole thing is junk and he is a has-been windbag.<p>I don't go along with that sort of vilification. If a post has one great insight, something I can learn from, I'm a happy man. I can chuckle at Joel complaining about competing for interns with Google as long as I'mn entertained by his prose and intrigued by his central thesis.<p>I would have loved this post on that basis.<p>Except.<p>WTF is with the dig at playing Ultimate? Joel, you have <i>totally lost it this time</i>. Ultimate is the ultimate nerd sport, and interns who play Ultimate are your <i>best hires ever</i>.<p>Ultimate involves complex plays involving team co-ordination. A skill that just might come in handy working on a software development team. The flight of the disc is the kind of thing the mathematical mind drools over--gyroscopic procession, ballistics, aerodynamics, everything comes in to play.<p>Ultimate players are healthy and I'll wager can crank code for long hours compared to those who eschew aerobic sports in favour of foosball.<p>And for those who are still single... Ultimate is a great place to meet people of every gender and orientation. Which leads to cohabitation, the purchase of homes, large mortgages, and a slavish devotion to working your ass off to earn a fat bonus.<p>Joel, I wanted to like this post, I really did. But you have <i>got</i> to stop making insanely wrong pronouncements about things that matter most.<p>Like which games interns ought to play ;-)",1209649487

Time.  It's almost like they <i>try</i> to do it.<p><i>Out of all the laptops I've had, (Toshiba, IBM, Sony, Dell, MacBook), the Macbook wins absolutely in terms of design, build quality, and functionality.</i><p>In terms of hardware, they're all the same designs from Intel.  Apple uses prettier build materials (metal); but Thinkpads are a lot more solid.  (Drainage holes under the keyboard, huge hinge connecting the screen to the base, easy to open up to add things, every screw has a part number for easy ordering, etc.)<p>In the end, I think people like Apple because Apple likes themselves so much.  It's very easy to get excited about something when you see other people doing it.  When Apple launches a product, it's a work of art.  When Lenovo releases a new Thinkpad... it's really fucking boring.  ""Yay, it looks exactly like last year's model!""  That doesn't mean it's not a good computer, though... it just means Apple markets to the ignorant better.  There is quite a large market of people that don't know anything :)<p>Finally, yeah the iPhone and OS X are kind of nice.  Unfortunately Apple likes to add cool features to their OS and then cripple them for The Media Companies; the same goes for the iPhone.  When I buy something, I want it to work for me, not whoever is paying Apple this week.<p>So I use Linux on a Thinkpad, and think about what I <i>do</i> with my computer instead of what it looks like.",1209647936

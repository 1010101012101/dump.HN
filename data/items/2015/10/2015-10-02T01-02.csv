Also with inoremap don&#x27;t you have to wait for the letter j to show up until you type your next character?

At Firepoint, we emphasize great user experiences with beautiful and clean design as the most important part of well-designed software. Because of this, your ability to design excellent user experiences is crucial to the success of our product and company. Being able to think creatively, empathize with user’s needs, and make decisions is crucial.<p>As Senior User Experience and Interface (UX/UI) Designer, your primary responsibility will be to understand the complex needs of users and product owners and translate them into a vision and design that is intuitive and delightful.<p>You will collaborate primarily with other Designers and the Product Owner to design mockups, wireframes, and/or prototypes, then translate your concepts into real frontend code that backend developers can hook up. Once you’re done coding, you will write or explain how to implement the frontend code you’ve written to Backend Developers, so detail-orientation and strong communication skills are a must. UI or UX related questions related to your designs will naturally come up during the course of development, and you’ll be the one to address them.<p>Once the feature is usable, you will have the opportunity to conduct experiments and assess user feedback to ensure it meets their needs in an enjoyable way.<p>There is exceptional opportunity for growth and leadership within the organization.<p>Please view the full job description before applying on either of these sites:

That is how we wound up getting involved with Igalia back in Feb 2013. I kicked off a multi-year project with Andy Wingo / Igalia to direct his mighty keyboard at generators and get them landed in v8. We weren&#x27;t quite sure TC-39 would agree async/await was a good thing in the end, but it seems now all the pieces are finally coming together. It is satisfying to see the endgame within reach right now and I hope it is worth it once it starts to become more widely available! Companies -- help get spec features implemented!

Living by such an amazing space has done wonders for my mood, and my opinion of Houston. The park is wonderfully anachronistic.<p>It seems plucked straight out of some european city, or at least the east coast of the US. I think that owes a lot to it using the original plans from the 1910s. Growing up in Texas, most of the parks you see are basically undeveloped land, set aside for public use. A playground might be the only feature of some parks. This is completely different.<p>Where I live in Houston, I can ride light rail to downtown or a baseball game. I can walk to a wonderful park. The museums are stellar (if you haven&#x27;t heard of the Menil collection, please look it up). I rarely have to even get on a highway, except when I&#x27;m heading out of town. The climate is miserable in the summer, thanks largely to the humidity of being a city built on top of what once must have been swamp land.

Sure people will use it for not-strictly-systems-programming things, but that&#x27;s on their head: they evaluate the trade-offs (e.g. if they can do without a GC) and choose Rust. Compromising the core goal (memory safety without garbage collection) by including a pervasive GC just because some people might make a slightly silly choice and use Rust where some other tools is better is just <i>wrong</i>. It would make Rust inappropriate for the places where there is essentially no other choice like it, putting in into a class with many other alternatives (e.g. Haskell, OCaml, D etc.).<p>In any case, on one hand you complain about slow, bloated software, and on the other about Rust not having a GC. The unpredictability of a GC being a major component of bloat in a lot of software. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: it is possible to write sleek software in a managed languages with GCs, but for many tasks this generally requires fighting against the GC, with things like object pools and buffers (basically reimplementing the standard techniques from non-GC&#x27;d languages), and, of course, it is definitely possible to write bloated software without one.<p>Rust is designed to make it easier to write code without a GC, by adopting many of the advantages that garbage collectors/managed languages bring to table (and more, e.g. static protection against iterator invalidation). There&#x27;s been a lot of people from Ruby, Python, JavaScript (etc.) backgrounds adding lower-level/more-control programming to their toolbox via Rust, something that was too daunting previously. This means that they can write software (or at least, sensitive parts of their code) that doesn&#x27;t suffer from the overhead/bloat of the managed languages.<p>Lastly, Rust&#x27;s memory management is nothing like &quot;manual memory management&quot; in C (or historical C++), I mean, it compiles down to be essentially the same thing at runtime, but what the programmer writes is very different. The combination of lifetimes, destructors and generics mean that it is difficult to do it wrong: memory leaks are rare, and the compiler will tell you about any dangling pointers, etc.",1443748018

It could just be isolated instances with the companies I&#x27;ve interviewed with, but its still a problem I&#x27;ve had.)<p>The places I&#x27;m interested in working at probably wouldn&#x27;t care much about me not having a degree in CS, but I would like the benefit of having someone outside of myself and my work stand behind my resume. I&#x27;d like to think GA will give me that benefit of the doubt when I go to apply for jobs I really want.<p>I could be mistaken, however.",1443747676

This is what CSP is for: it&#x27;s not for what you expect to serve, it&#x27;s for protecting against what you <i>don&#x27;t</i> expect to serve.<p>In the theoretical attack content-addressable scripting could open up, the user visits Malicious Site B, which loads a malicious script with the hash `abad1dea`. The owners of Malicious Site B use their XSS attack to insert the (simplified) HTML `<script src=&quot;<a href=""https://trusted.example.com/payload.js&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trusted.example.com/payload.js&quot;</a> hash=&quot;abad1dea&quot;>`. If Malicious Site B tried to insert a direct link to their payload at `malicious.example.com/payload.js`, it would be blocked due to the site&#x27;s CSP - however, if the site trusted the fact that it&#x27;s seen `abad1dea` from `malicious.example.com` as evidence that it could get the script from `trusted.example.com`, this would open up a vector allowing Malicious Site B to run the `abad1dea` payload in a way that would not be blocked by the CSP. This is why the UA still has to make the request, even though it already has the content.<p>With the behavior that&#x27;s been specced, a request will be made to `trusted.example.com` which will either 404 or give a different script, causing the XSS attack to be blocked by the page&#x27;s CSP.",1443747649

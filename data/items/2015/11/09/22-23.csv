We wanted to give LoL players a new tool to analyze team compositions and understand their strengths, weaknesses, power spikes and so on. Many of you confirmed that we are on the right track which made us more dedicated to develop LoL Guru! Now we feel it’s time to give you an update on how things went so far development wise and what you can expect from us in the future.<p>Updated features:<p>In live game analysis LoL Guru is now able to automatically arrange the champions to the correct lanes. In the rare cases when it’s wrong you still able to manually drag & drop them to the correct lanes.<p>Automatic region detection. Now we will detect where you are, and try to select the corresponding server automatically. If you register we will save both your server and summoner so you don’t need to type it ever again!<p>Shareable links. Both in team builder and live game analysis you are able to share the match analysis with your friends.<p>Improved grammar and accuracy. (Still some work in here. Proofreaders welcome.)<p>Spanish localization: www.lolguru.gg/es<p>We count on your ideas and help to make LoL Guru even better. What else should we implement?",1447109717

It&#x27;s not like pointers where if you dereference NULL, you&#x27;ve hit a special case where anything could happen. There&#x27;s a difference between a language-level NULL, as pointers have, and a value with no special language meaning which you give special meaning at a higher level.<p>If you want an example of a non-pointer nullable type, float and double probably qualify.

I have NEVER seen a report on toxicity of solar panels in use from &quot;leakage&quot;, if there is such a thing, please post. Yes, solar panels contain elements like Cd and As, so do many of the electronics that you carry around in your pocket, and as long as they are bonded inside a semiconductor, they are basically inert slices of rock. However, most commercial solar panels today are silicon-based, with these other elements as dopants at a tiny percentage. A CdTe solar panel would be made of, well, Cadmium and Tellurium, both of which are pound-for-pound thousands of time more toxic to humans than silicon !!!! (though still basically inert slices of rock if they are in solid-state solar panels).<p>Admittedly, as with all e-waste, we need to look to what happens to solar panels when their life is up and they are landfilled or, hopefully, recycled. That said, over its 25+ year useful life, a solar panel will prevent tons of coal from being burned, which in and of itself would release a non-zero amount of cadmium and other heavy metals into the atmosphere.",1447109462

Or it could mean &quot;unknown&quot; in which case it is a data inconsistency. It could mean &quot;not available&quot;, in which case it is a signal. It could mean &quot;uninitialized data&quot;, in which case it is a process error.<p>There&#x27;s no way to programmatically determine which of these cases it is.<p>>I don&#x27;t understand the implication that storing NULL means something went wrong?<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean something went wrong. It also doesn&#x27;t mean something went right. It means <i>nothing</i> by itself.<p>NULL simply has no consistent semantics in a DB model. Its only semantic purpose is to make joins consistent, which often has nothing to do with your problem domain. That&#x27;s why higher levels of normalization tend toward fewer uses of NULL.<p>Imagine you were using a database to log processes on a supercomputer. You log access to the machine whenever a process starts, and you write a NULL value to the end_time field for the process. What does NULL mean, here? Does it mean the process is still running? Or does it mean the process failed to write it&#x27;s end state (for instance, if the machine crashed?) Does it mean the process is non-terminating? If you read this value from the database, would it be correct to wait for the process to finish?<p>You&#x27;d have to go and look at what processes are running. Which means this field no longer models the end time of the process, it models some dirty hybrid thing that you have to manually verify every time you read a NULL value. That&#x27;s the problem with NULLs: they are <i>bad at modeling your domain.</i> It&#x27;s a big middle finger from your data telling you to verify it yourself. It is one of those things that makes computers stupid, because you can&#x27;t get past it without involving a human brain.

The young eels somehow then make their way back to the rivers.<p>The high prices are for the &quot;glass eels&quot;, the juvenile stage.  They are caught with nets in the river as they return.   This article is about the path taken by the adult eels from the river, to the ocean.  Knowing the rough path they take in the ocean is unlikely to help anyone catch more eels.<p>If you want to catch the eels, you do it in the small river, rather than in the open ocean.  Knowing more about their reproduction helps us understand and protect eels.

10536248,comment,10531046,10531046,0,0,saganus,,,"I think that sometimes there&#x27;s another factor that gets overseen when discussing torture.<p>The &quot;problem&quot; that I believe is also tried to be addressed with torture is the view that the society that &quot;supports torture&quot; (via their government, even if against the opinion of most people) can&#x27;t let leniency get in the way of righteous retribution against their enemies.<p>Imagine if someone invents a pill that is literally the &quot;truth serum&quot;, and that the subject taking it can&#x27;t lie for say an hour or so.<p>Would that end torture? If torture&#x27;s only objective is to get information then it should.<p>But what if torture is really filling another role? one that is not satisfiable by information but by inflicting pain on your enemy?<p>I&#x27;m not defending torture by any means, and I do think it should be something that we as humanity should strive to end. But it seems like more often than not you can find people that would not defend torture, &quot;except in cases of extreme need&quot;, i.e. when they need retribution.<p>It would be interesting to do some research on what victims of crime and violence, and their families, think about what it would be &quot;fair&quot; to do to their offenders. Maybe it turns out most won&#x27;t be willing to inflict pain in others, or maybe it turns out most people are vengeful and would like to see their enemies suffer.<p>If the case is the latter, then I think the main problem with torture would be not as a tool to obtain information, but as a tool to inflict retribution.<p>What if a society that is mainly governed by people of the second kind get a hold of the ability to torture? e.g. CIA interrogators, people that sign torture orders, etc? then in their minds it would be justifiable, even if the activity doesn&#x27;t yield any useful information.<p>If it does, then they get the information AND retribution. If they don&#x27;t get truthful information then they still get retribution.<p>That&#x27;s why I think torture is a subject so hard for officials to understand the damage it can cause. As long as they think retribution in this form is OK, then it will be very hard to end this practice.",1447107620

This talk will demonstrate the combination of technologies that make such a thing possible, the results that have been achieved so far, and the challenges that still remain when trying to take python onto javascript&#x27;s home turf.<p>> We&#x27;ll cover: an overview of PyPy and why it&#x27;s a good fit for this type of project; an introduction to asmjs and the rise of javascript as a compile target; what it looks like when you smoosh these two technologies together; a comparison with other approaches such as brython and PythonJS; and some concrete suggestions for how the result might be useful in practice.",1447107053

A living part of the body that isn&#x27;t self repairing needs to be regenerated somehow.  The tooth -under the enamel- is a complex living structure that doesn&#x27;t self-repair.  Much of our medical practice, esp. w.r.t. trauma, is based on the premise that the body can repair itself if perhaps given some assistance.  But that premise fails with cavities.<p>At first blush, I was hoping that this work was going to be an advance that would promote repair in the deeper layers of the tooth.

No guarantee required. Our tenancy is for three years, before which the landlord cannot terminate it, but we can with 3 months&#x27; notice at any time. Renting was easy and cheap, and comes with a great deal of security.<p>- our new bank wanted a LOT of information about us, and some 70 pages of documentation. But now it&#x27;s set up I can email or phone them and get an instant response from someone that knows me and my family (and speaks fluent English to boot). Their online systems are considerably better than my previous UK bank&#x27;s.<p>- Registering for self-employment was entirely online and took 20 minutes.<p>- I fill out a social security return quarterly, which takes ~45 seconds, and all of the calculations are handled for me.<p>- We pay more tax than in the UK. But the state also pays for 85% of our childcare costs, and credits half of the remainder against our income tax bill.<p>- When I needed to check on our residence tax status, I rolled up at our local tax office where I was seen within 2 minutes by a friendly official who had immediately called all our details up on his computer, showed me what I needed to know and told me everything was in hand. (It was.)<p>It&#x27;s not perfect. Being an employer is seriously not fun. Self-employment has its issues too. But it seems to be getting better, and by and large the systems work. (Probably because there are huge numbers of people running them.)",1447106529

It&#x27;s about students protesting against a campus culture that they feel discriminates against them. Such as when a frat house explicitly banned black girls from entering on Halloween. [1]<p>This is the closest the author comes to addressing the real issue, rather than picking anecdotes and quotes to defend his thesis while hyperbolically [2] bashing the &quot;activists&quot;:<p><i>Some Yalies are defending their broken activist culture by seizing on more defensible reasons for being upset. “The protests are not really about Halloween costumes or a frat party,” Yale senior Aaron Lewis writes. “They’re about a mismatch between the Yale we find in admissions brochures and the Yale we experience every day. They’re about real experiences with racism on this campus that have gone unacknowledged for far too long. The university sells itself as a welcoming and inclusive place for people of all backgrounds. Unfortunately, it often isn’t.”<p>But regardless of other controversies at Yale, its students owe Nicholas and Erika Christakis an apology. And they owe apologies to other objects of their intolerance, too.</i><p>This is bad and misleading journalism written to generate views and stoke a flame war by bringing in the popular theme of college-student-as-inept-coddled-child-who-fights-for-trivial-things-and-bullies-others.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/05/a-confrontation-over-race-at-yale-hundreds-of-students-demand-answers-from-the-schools-first-black-dean/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/0...</a><p>[2] <i>This beggars belief. Yale students told to talk to each other if they find a peer’s costume offensive helplessly declare that they’re unable to do so without an authority figure specifying “any modes or means to facilitate these discussions,” as if they’re Martians unfamiliar with a concept as rudimentary as disagreeing in conversation, even as they publish an open letter that is, itself, a mode of facilitating discussion.</i>",1447106526

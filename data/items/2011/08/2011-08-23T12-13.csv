We've all got our own path.<p>Now,  the article entirely misses the elephant in the room with self employment,  which is health insurance.

- Gold cannot be printed, duplicated, or fabricated in any way.
- Gold, because of it's unique color and atomic weight is almost impossible to imitate.<p>Gold is real money that holds it's value over time.  It is not in a bubble.

In Nigeria, 25% of the national budget is dedicated to the personal expenses of the lawmakers by law. The rest makes its way into a very corrupt system that the multinational oil corporations are complicit in building after infiltrating the government and civil service at all levels [wikileaks]. They easily avoid accountability for persistent decade-long oil spills that exceed the Gulf of Mexico incident each year. In the long term, this 'oil wealth' is toxic to the society, infrastructure and environment of these countries.<p>The demand for oil is in every sense an economic addiction and the governments of the industrialised world will suspend all principle to keep the pipelines flowing. They empower ruthless sociopaths with billions of dollars and feign outrage when these despots hold their people hostage and slaughter thousands to maintain their hold on power. Why are the world's most dangerous men invariably from major oil producing countries?<p>I think the capitalist ideal of money as the only measure of success is a very irresponsible way to run a planet. In the past at least, the system seemed to work in favour of a few countries that were first at the controls.

There's a whole lot of clipboards (called ""registers"") in Vim, some of which have a special purpose. This is a very powerful feature but it doesn't work like the rest of your apps do so it may be misleading at first.<p>Find and replace is another feature that's not so easy to get started with in Vim, but, again, it can do regex matches and a whole lot more than your regular text editor can.<p>Vim has also got a neat undo feature, which actually stores a tree-like history.<p>New document, save, print and others can easily be found in just about any Vim GUI.<p>If you want a smooth start with Vim without having to learn everything again, you can use evim (bundled with default Vim) that uses all these Windows-ey ""default"" keybindings.<p>It's also worth mentioning that most of Vim's keybindings are default keybindings in Unix since the dawn of man (before Ctrl-S was ever used for saving anything).

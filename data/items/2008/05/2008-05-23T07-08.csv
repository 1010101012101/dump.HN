197837,comment,197269,197269,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"As a long-time Autodesk customer, I can see the problem from Autodesk's perspective.  Standard procedure with Autodesk products is to upgrade to a higher version at a lower cost than buying a brand new copy every couple years.  After the upgrade, the customer still has the old software sitting around, so if the customer were to sell the old version, and the new owner then upgrades, Autodesk is out the difference in cost between new and upgrade.  Autodesk can control for this by tracking serial numbers of course, but the unknowledgeable new owner would be unable to upgrade the product through no fault of theirs and effectively have wasted some good money if they need to upgrade.",1211528830

I have ""only"" 6MBit connection, but I almost never see these speeds: only a handful of top-dogs like google/yahoo are capable of responding quickly. Flickr, PicasaWeb, GMail, ESPN and BaseCamp are my bottlenecks - it's them who are slow, not my connection. Even GoogleMaps got more sluggish recently, even without StreetView turned on. Faster broadband won't help those laggy services.",1211527996

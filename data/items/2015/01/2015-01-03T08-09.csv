8830274,comment,8827985,8827985,0,0,colin_mccabe,,,"I don&#x27;t really agree with most of the ideas presented here.  Setting your corporate firewall to &quot;default deny&quot; is just security theater, not real security.  If a black hat installs malware somewhere, it can just as easily phone home via HTTP as on some random port.  Arguably, the security theater of forcing everything on to HTTP actually makes it harder to spot anomalous traffic patterns.  Earlier someone might have seen a lot of traffic on port 1234 and said &quot;hmm, that&#x27;s funny...&quot; but with default deny it&#x27;s impossible to see anything weird except by doing deep packet inspection.<p>As another poster here pointed out, hacking has gone pro.  Clearly governments and organized crime have gotten into the business.  The idea that people are going into hacking because &quot;the media lionizes hackers&quot; (like this blog post suggests) just seems kind of silly now.  I think if anything, the media tends to exaggerate how scary most hackers are in order to sell more product.<p>I agree with the author that we are on a treadmill of patching vulnerabilities while creating new vulnerabilities.  We&#x27;ll never really get anywhere as long as we are on the treadmill.  But this post doesn&#x27;t point out any of the things that would actually help.  For example, I think better sandboxing techniques in operating systems would help reduce the number of vulnerabilities.  Unmanaged programming languages such as C/C++ are a perennial source of vulnerabilities, as everyone seems to know by now.  Although most people don&#x27;t seem to comment on this, languages with eval() such as Python, Perl, Lisp, SQL and Javascript have their own set of vulnerabilities that come from this construct.  If we wanted to, we could get rid of these constructs.<p>Djikstra famously argued that computer science was not about computers.  You could make a pretty good case that computer security is not (primarily) about computers, either.  A lot of great hackers like Kevin Mitnick were able to penetrate systems just by calling up a technician and pretending to be someone they were not.  Computers have given more power to individuals, but the problem of finding trustworthy individuals for your organization is no different than it was before computers came on the scene.  A lot of hacks are really just cases of where too much information was shared with too many people who didn&#x27;t need to have it, or systems were run with inadequate oversight... neither of which are technical problems.",1420275105

IIRC the two best use cases for it are for people going through chemotherapy and people with glaucoma. I agree that the standards of medical necessity are so low as to be meaningless, and whoile there seems to be inexorable movement towards full legalization, the bullshit medical rationalizations slow that down and IMHO make it harder to get funding for more rigorous clinical studies on its efficacy for pain management and other likely conditions.",1420272571

With that said I have read of a wide variety of medical applications outside of the therapeutic ones often talked about. NORML has a great site covering a lot of the studies:

Anything you set your mind to- it may take awhile, but keep at it & believe in yourself- regardless of what _anyone_- even so-called experts may have to say negative. When you want to go & do something, know that others who have found success at doing something similar, were one day as inexperienced as you might be now. Just try to learn as much as you can- take the good & leave the bad, and have at it as best as you can. Seek out those who can help you, surround yourself with these people- remove negative people from your circle of influencers, and give it your best. Actively do good, & passively fight evil. Make an effort to learn from your mistakes, and remember- god favors someone who puts in good effort, whose heart is in the right place. Don&#x27;t let yourself get unbalanced, keep pets around you to constantly remind you of what it is to care about someone/something who&#x27;s not you. Think about what it means to keep them happy, & put forth great effort to have a good relationship with them, they&#x27;ll always love you, no matter if you&#x27;re up or down. Be careful not to put all your faith in one person/group of people, they have the capacity/likelyhood to turn on you when the time is right for them. But don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for help- _everyone_ needs help at one point or another, whether they let you know it or not. And even if you don&#x27;t believe in god, pray anyway- it does something in our minds that&#x27;s good for us. Science proves it, believing in something abstract helps our subconscious somehow that science has yet to explain. Look for ways to be an optimist, it&#x27;ll help you far more than you could imagine. It&#x27;s very hard sometimes to find the light side of darkness, but it&#x27;s always there. Even if you have to repeatedly talk to yourself in order to feel a sliver of gratitude for something as mundane as being priveleged enough to not live in a third world country, or a war torn region, that little feeling of gratitude, even if you only feel it for a fraction of a second, has the power to grow in your subconscious and carry you through tough times that will certainly arise. If you can get in the habit of finding something to be grateful for, your subconscious will do some invisible magic & pop up and help you one day when you need it most. Someone like &#x27;mouselover&#x27; will post on HN & ask a question that forces you to remind yourself what works for you at a time when you&#x27;ve almost forgotten it yourself.",1420272375

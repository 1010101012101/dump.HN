It's easier to find and download things than any peer-to-peer service I've tried, especially when I want the entire album[1].  And unlike the iTunes store, I don't have to use iTunes to do my shopping.  It's all just browser-based, and then I can play the music in Amarok, which has a better interface than iTunes does.<p>[1] I listen mostly to classical music, which makes this the case a lot more often than with modern works.

As he points out, if what you're working on isn't currently your favourite piece of music (or software), you're not giving it the attention it deserves.<p>In that vein, my favourite piece of software is my (not finished yet, but still very useful as it currently exists) ""tarsnap"" backup software (<a href=""http://www.tarsnap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tarsnap.com</a>).",1192678010

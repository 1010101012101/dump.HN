4128827,comment,4128541,4128541,1,0,bmelton,,,"It depends on a lot, but having done both purely engineering jobs and consultant type of jobs as well, you'll get a much broader variety of tasks by doing consulting.  Each customer will undoubtedly have an entirely different set of things they're looking for and ways they want it to be implemented, and on top of that, they'll have different systems they need integrating with.<p>Depending on the job, it might also entail travel to new places, an expense account for dining (which makes eating nicer a little lighter of a burden), the ability to interact with new people all over the nation, etc.<p>Another perk is that you drive the development process, within reason.  As a vendor developer, you're more easily able to push back on unreasonable development timelines, as far as being able to tell the customer things like ""That's impossible,"" which you would have a harder time saying to your real boss when given a task.  Your time is billable, and time spent with a customer is profit to the company.  If it's actually going to take you three weeks to build it, then take that long.  They don't want you building it in half that time unless you're billing the hours for it anyway.<p>Conversely, they don't want you to take too long to do things as the customer relationship is sacresanct, of course.  But there's less push back on doing things in a reasonable, actual time that managers tend to overlook when your work as a developer is 'overhead', which most pure engineering jobs are at big corporations.<p>As a developer at a startup it's different obviously, you're talent, not overhead, but the trade off is often your personal life.<p>There's no golden job, of course, but consulting benefitted me greatly when I did it, and can be a great experience.  You'll sacrifice some learning, like working with a close-knit team, the ability to report to the same office every day, but in return you get a larger degree of autonomy and a completely different set of challenges.",1340056720

If you want to combine the bandwidth of both connections into one fat virtual pipe, you could get a cheap VPS and then run an Open VPN link over the bonded virtual interface on your linux box at home to the VPS box (I think!

4128788,comment,4127136,4128635,3,0,0x0,,,"Thank you for an incredibly detailed, interesting and well formulated explanation of the jailbreak process!<p>I had the general idea that the sandbox was probably working out of some complicated rulesets a la SElinux (which I also do not know in detail, unfortunately).<p>To clarify a few of my original mis-conceptions:<p>* For the iBooks DRM, one of the JB tests was apparently to drop an (incorrectly signed?) exexutable and try to exec() it, if it runs, the sandbox is ""no good"". Out of this; I assumed (some) jailbreaks would therefore allow any App Store app to go crazy exec()ing (since iBooks comes from the App Store), which feels like a security problem<p>* I wasn't aware that jailbreaks still maintained a sandbox for AppStore apps, while bypassing it for non-AppStore apps. I assume installing .debs from cydia is the equivalent of handing the .deb author a root shell. (OpenSSH comes from a .deb, for example)<p>* I wasn't aware whether keychains and other private data was protected after a jailbreak. Could apps go snooping on other app data, for example to pick up credentials/session cookies from Facebook.app, read stored mail, access the photo roll without the location permission prompt, etc. Only non-AppStore apps?<p>In other words, does it boil down to:<p>* You can still install AppStore apps without worry, they only run within their own context? (I am guessing: mostly yes, but if apple were evil they could do the iBook DRM trick, post back your UDID to apple and ban your device)<p>* You should exercise extreme caution with any .deb, since that's equivalent to handing out a root shell to the author (even just for a moment - .deb preinst scripts etc?)<p>Thanks again for taking time to explain all the details so far.

Would you say your smartphone is ever asleep?  Mine never is.  If it's not powered off, it's constantly working in the background, for my benefit (presumably). It checks email, weather alerts, waits for calls and everything else. It may not be the focus of my attention, but it's certainly not asleep.<p>The author clearly wants to treat it like a traditional computer not surprising given his opening statement about not viewing it as a worthy replacement to act as one's ""main device"".  If that's the mental model one uses, then yes, I completely see the issue  and yes, the upcoming do not disturb settings will be an all around blessing.<p>However, the big take away isn't whether the designers at Apple were right and the do not disturb settings will be just an added feature or if the author is right and the lack of a do not disturb setting is a huge failure.<p>The point is, instead, that we need to be better about understanding and predicting alternative mindsets on the part of others.<p>From a design perspective, this is pretty obvious... but from a consumer/critic's standpoint, it's a necessary one as well. Failing to see this subtle issue makes your criticism much less impressive and much less valuable if you're in a place to be influencing future development because seeing the more abstract difference in mindsets will (often) help you see other issues (good and bad).",1340055890

4128736,comment,4124275,4127041,5,0,bane,,,"Sorry this is going to be long, but I'm going to try and explain my...perhaps provincial and unfair...way of thinking about Rothko...<p>First off, there is some truly great modern art being produced these days. I really think it has to do with the maturing of modern art as a field (see #2 below). Some of the recent Russian surrealists are producing astonishing stuff and there is some absolutely wonderful, delicate, sculpture art coming out of Japan in the last 20 years.<p>Something I've tried to do when helping my friends to try and appreciate modern art is to explain it in two ways:<p>1) It's important to understand a work of art as part of a continuum of the artist's individual work. I usually use Picasso as a frame of reference. He started off with a fairly traditional style, some really great stuff, and at a young age. He had a genuine interest and talent for the field. <i>Ciencia y Caridad</i> and even <i>La Salchichona</i> are quite good stuff. So when you look at Picasso through his career, and the transition into his later forms, you can generally see the progression and how he arrived where he did.<p>2) It's important to understand a work of art given the confluence of history and the actions/reactions of artists. Major shifts in art styles are quite often a reaction to a perceived dead-end to an older form. An older form may have evolved to the point that there simply is nothing more that can be said with this form...it's become an intolerable box of so many arbitrary rules that everybody's work ends up like everybody else's work. To jump out of the box might mean inventing a new form or new direction. Often works of art that are near the beginning of an immature style seem simple, silly or even childish. But those produced as the style matures <i>can</i> end up as quite wonderful. I find the music world provides several great examples of this happening, Classical music (e.g. Mozart) was as much a response to the cruft that had built up around Baroque (e.g. Bach) as anything. A more modern take might be minimalism. One of my favorite composers in the style is Steve Reich. His early stuff I can take or leave, endless experiments with phase and looped recordings blah blah. But some of his later stuff is sublime. Minimalism had matured sufficiently during his own lifetime that it went from screwing around with the interesting rhythms that appear when two pianos play the same phrase slightly out of phase...to intense, layered tapestries of sound that can fill a concert hall.<p>Try as I might, I can't seem to apply either of these very successfully to Rothko without ending up cynical. If I go with approach #1, I can't seem to come up with a narrative that shows a steady progression. Instead it seems like he simply bounced around from fad to fad, selecting whatever was fashionable at the time that seemed both impenetrable to the layman and required as little effort as possible on his part to paint. His responses to criticisms are usually layers of indecipherable Yoda-like nonsense. He didn't start as an artist very young, and after he did decide to take it up (in his 20s I think!) he didn't really seem to make a serious go at it. He did the equivalent of taking a couple of correspondence classes and hanging around with the currently fashionable crowd. When fashion changed (e.g. Salvador Dali's triumphant shows), Rothko simply switched to a hack tale on whatever was drawing the crowds. It doesn't seem to be a man driven by an insatiable passion to find his own voice. There just doesn't seem to be any sort of recognizable innovation in his work arguably until he starts painting big monotone rectangles. But that's like saying framing a paint sample the last time I painted my living room is ""innovative"".<p>Applying #2 is almost as bad. He seemed to be more of a hanger-on to the fashionable club of the day. In startup-ese, he seemed to pivot to the best selling, least effort fad of the year. ""What's fashionable this year? Moderne or Abstract Expressionism? Which is easier? Abstract Expressionism it is! I can crank out like 20-30 of these puppies a day!"" There's no real progression from his subway figure paintings to his surrealist period to his abstract expressionist period. He just bounces from one to the other. Art appreciation commentators and textbooks try and retrofit this into a narrative of him ""stripping away the unnecessary"" or ""simplifying his work"" but it seems like he just came full circle, from somebody who wasn't ever particularly interested in art, and didn't want to put much effort into it, into somebody who just couldn't be bothered in the end. He doesn't seem to fit in as part of the evolution of art since he bounces around between movements (but with the same hamfisted lack of polish or style) and doesn't evolve with them and he definitely doesn't appear to set a direction for the art world to follow in it's next evolving step.<p>Other than volume (why bother naming them, I'll do colors, then numbers for a while, but then I'll get bored and just not bother) there just doesn't seem to be any skill or point to his work. And there's nothing wrong with that, but we call those kinds of folks ""house painters"" not ""artists"". The East wall in my dining room doesn't need a title either.<p>(full disclosure, I've seen Rothko's work at the National Gallery in the specially constructed Tower exhibit, at the Leeum's small but really well curated modern art collection (though I don't think they displayed his works as well as they could have), the MoMA (of course), the Guggenheim in NYC and Venice, and I think the Musee D'art Moderne in Paris and have <i>really</i> tried to get with it w/r to his body of work including reading a biography about him at some point and watching a documentary about his life)<p>Sure, art is subject to personal taste, and I'm not saying that anybody is wrong in liking his stuff, it's just that I end up decidedly <i>not</i> enjoying his work and always leave with a cynical taste in my mouth no matter how open minded I go in. But as always with art, it's up to the individual to interpret and enjoy the art.

4128635,comment,4127136,4128260,15,0,saurik,,,"The main thing for which you seem to need correction is that you apparently do not know what the sandbox does ;P. You seem to be operating under the belief that the sandbox is a system-wide primitive, when in fact each separate process operates in its own optional sandbox.<p>There are many processes, then, where there is no sandbox configured <i>even on a stock iPhone</i>. When you use Cydia (no sandbox) to install sshd (no sandbox) that is orthogonal to the behavior of other third-party applications that are still restricted to their sandboxes.<p>(As a quick aside on OpenSSH, as you mention that the root user ""may"" required a password: all users require passwords. However, the default password for both the mobile and root accounts is ""alpine"". If you install something like OpenSSH you <i>should</i> change these passwords.)<p>In the specific case of iBooks, the fairplay DRM checks are not checking that the sandboxes were damaged, but more generally that the system was jailbroken at all: the new checks verify that the kernel memory has not been modified by comparing hashes of critical code, and the old ones from this article that unsigned code runs (orthogonal to a sandbox).<p>Finally, the fact that the jailbreak works indicates that the pre-jailbroken system was insecure, not that the jailbroken system now has less security. In fact, for more serious exploits, the opposite is true: until Apple releases a patch, you should jailbreak to be safe.<p>As an example, the exploits that are launched from jailbreakme.com take advantage of bugs in the web browser (v1 attacked TIFF, v2 and v3 attacked TTF). These bugs were already there: any web page anywhere on the Internet could have used these to compromise MobileSafari.<p>Once in MobileSafari, bugs in the kernel are used that, again, were already there. These bugs could have been used by any code running on your system, including code running inside of a third-party App Store app (despite the sandbox) to jailbreak and possibly even rootkit your device.<p>However, once you were jailbroken, we offered (in all three of those cases; sometimes as packages and sometimes just by default as part of the process), patches to MobileSafari that would correct the ingress attack vector. Thereby, once jailbroken, you were protected from that exploit.<p>As to your separate (valid) point about jailbreaks not describing what they do, sadly the different jailbreaks that are available often use specific (as in, not shared; I'm failing to find the right word) kernel patches that are often even incompatible with each other (having different behavior).<p>Thereby, I can't tell you exactly what any specific jailbreak does. :( However, the overall game plan that they follow is fairly constant, and I can tell you what the ""best practice"" patches that jailbreaks install by default are in a short list here.<p>1) AFC2: allows you to access, over USB, all of / as root instead of just /var/mobile/Media as mobile. (Some people, including myself, do not like this patch; it is just an entry in a config file and is easy to remove.)<p>2) fstab / rw: makes / be mounted read-write. Normally the partition that holds the system software is read-only. As the files on this partition are owned by root, this does not affect the abilities of App Store applications (which run as mobile).<p>3) fstab /var suid dev: allows setuid executables and device nodes on the user data partition. You have to already have elevated permissions to create these files, so again this does not affect the abilities of App Store applications.<p>4) codesign: allow code that has not been signed by anyone to execute. This patch allows you to install code from third-party sources on your device, but does not affect the content you obtain from the App Store: they will only give you binaries that they have signed and verified.<p>5) codehash: allow processes with ""corrupt"" pages of code to execute. I disagree with this patch (and many jailbreaks do not include it), but it does not affect the abilities of App Store applications as they do not have write access to modify any executables.<p>6) rw->rx: supports changing a page of memory from writable to executable. Combined with earlier patches, this allows you to build JIT compilers, and is needed for Substrate's MSHookFunction to modify the behavior of a C function. This does affect <i>all</i> process security.<p>This sixth patch does <i>not</i>, as some people will claim, remove all the advantages of non-executable data or other stack protections. These pages still load as rw and are not executable: you cannot just overflow into them and then jump to them to execute their contents.<p>However, you <i>can</i> first re-mark the memory region as rx before jumping to it. To do so would require a return-to-libc attack. However, if you already know enough about the target process to do a return-to-libc you may as well just do a return-oriented-programming attack.<p>It also should be noted that even if you consider the return-to-libc followed by the jump to the now-executable region to be a security hazard, it must be noted that there could be any manner of non-memory security-related mistakes in the App Store applications you have installed.<p>I will thereby argue that you are really, in the end, relying on the application sandboxes to provide security: the App Store developer probably left tons of gaping holes in their code, and may have even included an entire interpreter-VM... this patch does not increase the magnitude of an attack, only the probability.<p>7) rwx: allows memory to be marked for write and execute at the same time. This is dangerous, conceptually, but it is required for high-performance JITs. Otherwise, you find yourself having to flip the page from write to execute back constantly, which has performance and safety ramifications.<p>Applications that choose to mark their pages rwx will end up with lowered security with this patch. However, such processes are normally virtual machines that have numerous other security mitigation strategies, and should therefore, in the end, be much safer than stricter native applications.<p>However, I will argue that this patch does not offer an attacker anything over the sixth patch: to attack a normal process you will still need to use mmap/mprotect to manually get some rwx pages, at which point you already have return-to-libc and probably just need rx, not rwx.<p>8) sandbox: allow processes to access files that are outside of their sandbox based on Unix permissions rather than the normal sandbox rules. This affects the security of App Store applications, but there is much more nuance to it.<p>This, then, is the last and most important patch to our discussion. In some jailbreaks this patch <i>sucks</i>: it literally just turns off the sandbox entirely. You can normally tell that this happened because nothing works ;P (the sandboxes also mediate shared keychain access).<p>Most jailbreaks instead make targeted modifications to the sandbox restrictions. The ""best practice"" that I laid out for this patch a while back (and which planetbeing and comex both implemented for various jailbreaks, and which I believe is being used in redsn0w and Absinthe currently) is:<p>""Add an exception that if a file being accessed is <i>not</i> stored in /var/mobile (the user's home directory) then rather than do not have the sandbox intercept or affect the access check: allow the normal Unix permissions to (probably deny) the access.""<p>This allows you to get read access to files stored on the system permission (not write access, as that would require root). It also allows developers to specifically create scratch storage that is writable by mobile (if they need) somewhere on the filesystem.<p>While I can come up with some theoretical reasons why there might be a security risk in having read access to files that, thanks to any single person having jailbroken their device, anyone can just download from the Internet anyway, I consider this a far and difficult stretch.<p>Instead, I will argue that all of the important data is stored in the user's home directory (/var/mobile), and that the parts of the sandbox that ""work for the user"" protect the files in that folder, while the other parts of the sandbox are more ""working for Apple"".<p>(This is detectable because if you install some extensions, such as ""file:// for MobileSafari"", you can get Safari to read from static web pages stored anywhere on the filesystem <i>but</i> your home directory. This causes a lot of confusion to some people, as that is an obvious place to put things ;P.)<p>So, AFAIK, none of the major jailbreaks that you find deactivate the sandbox on these personal files. When developers really consider the ability to access these files important, they build daemons (running in the background outside of sandboxes) to mediate access.<p>Hopefully this goes to some length to help you with your concerns (and I guess I'll now go tell Britta that I wrote this, so she can use content from it or refer people to it as required in the future). I'd still love to get better references for where you see random misinformation ;P.<p>(edit: I just thought of another patch that is included. 9) crazeles: a ludicrously complicated hack by planetbeing that neuters the FairPlay DRM checks that cause iBooks to refuse to operate correctly on jailbroken devices. This specifically addresses the earlier paragraph on iBooks.)",1340054607

The Book of the New Sun has very interesting atmosphere and bits with a lot of flavor (alzabo, the introduction of Dorcas). Plus he actually managed to paint a convincing image of a very, very, very old world where you can't even dig in the ground without finding some bits of history. And my interpretation is that ""Urth"" is actually an evolved name of ""Earth"". I also read a couple of stories in similar way. It was quite amusing that in a play featuring the creation of Earth, an autarch appeared on day 1. It's almost as if the society can't imagine a world without one.<p>But the writing is really dry, some parts longer than they need to be, and majority of characters not memorable. I liked Jonas and the encounter with the mad autarch.<p>Overall, I would rate it 3.5-4 out of 5. It would be a great read if it was a bit more condensed.<p>As for the boards, they reminded me of the hunt for the fifth replicant among Blade Runner fans. The script was changed and the scene with one replicant was removed, but dialogue still mentioned 5 replicants. The speculations were batshit insane, until Ridley Scott simply said it was an error in the script.<p>Wolfe does have interesting ideas sometimes. The first book about Latro was fun in a perverse way. A character who completely forgets what he saw yesterday - yet he always found something new to say about his companions. They are shown in different light as they travel. It sure beats Terry Pratchett introducing the Librarian in exactly the same way for the 20th time.

Except that for those who <i>do</i> have a reader, you've reduced the friction for them.

One of them had to do with frequency scaling...<p>PCs have many time sources.  The processor has it's own internal clock that ticks at a very fast rate (nanoseconds).  There's the wallclock time which ticks at a slow rate (seconds).  The internal clock starts at 0 when the system boots so it can't be used for wallclock time without adjustment.<p>Some Operating Systems (like Linux), get the boot time from the real time clock (slow tick rate) but then compute the current time by adding the CPU internal clock to it.<p>The CPU internal clock (TSC) can be wildly inaccurate for various reasons.  One of them is frequency scaling which actually changes the frequency of the TSC dynamically.  Unfortunately, if you're changing the frequency of the TSC on the host, guests that are running and accessing the TSC directly don't realize this has happened.<p>So if you scale the TSC frequency by 50%, time starts moving 50% more slowly.  BIOS can also scale processor speed on some servers without the OS knowing which can lead to the same problem on bare metal.<p>More modern processors now have fixed TSC frequencies and KVM now has a paravirtual clock source both which address this problem.<p>BTW, Windows does not use the TSC as a time source so Windows typically won't have this problem (although it has other problems).<p>Time keeping in virtualization is fun :-)",1340053580

I'm fresh out of college with my B.S. in Computer Science, and I'm looking around for jobs.  I very much want to end up doing some kind of software development.  However I am current talking with a company who has openings for a ""Consultant"" gig, the training of which includes programming, as does the job.  HOWEVER, the job itself is not pur programming.  According to the person I talked to, the job is only about 15-20% programming, the rest is client interaction, on-site support, etc.  To top it all off, the actual coding is using proprietary software and language.<p>So here's my actual question:  Say I were to take this job (If I get it).  I spend 4 years there, and for some reason or another I decide to move on and look for Software Engineer jobs.  Will ANY of this time spent as the Consultant count as what could be ""Programming Experience"" for a higher level developer position?  Alternatively, would the situation be changed at all if I devoted spare time during the Consulting gig to contribute to Open-Source on github and the like?<p>Please help me if you can, I'm a bit lost on what to do, since I have very little experience with this sort of thing as of yet (and I'm not afraid to admit it.)<p>Regards,<p>Max",1340053513

The two giant cable telecoms I've dealt with charged ~$5/month for a wifi router which is really highway robbery - especially considering the quality of the routers they provided. Their provided cablemodems were pretty much universally awful too, so you were better off buying both your own modem and router - but they obviously didn't advertise that you could do this, if you weren't technically savvy you'd never have a clue. One friend I helped out was amazed that they could get wifi without paying TW $5/month and how much better it worked without TW's equipment.<p>I'm currently on Qwest (formerly anyway, now acquired by CenturyLink) DSL. Qwest provided an excellent modem/wifi router for free, but I have no idea if CenturyLink would do the same now - I kind of suspect the giant teleco would probably provide inferior equipment and/or charge for it.",1340053274

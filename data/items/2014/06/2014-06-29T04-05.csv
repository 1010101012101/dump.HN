The numbers in DOJ press releases when multiple related charges are involved are way off, because they do not take into account how related charges interact at sentencing.

There&#x27;s a trivial solution: Don&#x27;t do that.<p>Once you&#x27;ve called realloc() and it&#x27;s returned non-NULL, p is gone--for all anyone knows it points to random nothingness. Yes, it seems weird that the library was able to enlarge it in-place but the pointers end up non-equivalent. But you can&#x27;t <i>ever</i> blindly rely on the in-place realloc() optimization anyway.<p>Simply put, using p blindly after a successful realloc() is a use-after-free bug, no matter what. If you use realloc() correctly you will never see this.<p>Note that if you&#x27;ve proven the equivalence to the compiler it works fine:<p><pre><code>    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <stdlib.h>\n\n    int main() {\n      int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));\n      int *q = (int*)realloc(p, sizeof(int));\n      if (p == q) {\n          *p = 1;\n          *q = 2;\n          printf(&quot;%d %d\\n&quot;, *p, *q);\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nProduction code should never do this, though (it&#x27;s pointless).

7960371,comment,7959412,7959412,1,0,Fr0styMatt,,,"I&#x27;d never made the connection between &quot;low priority project&quot; and &quot;strictness of arbitrary deadlines&quot; as the project having to continually race against its&#x27; own insignificance.  That&#x27;s a fascinating insight and raises a number of questions.<p>For example, &#x27;crunch&#x27; is something that&#x27;s endemic in the games industry and a contributing factor is that big publishers will impose arbitrary deadlines on their studios to &#x27;ship a game&#x27;.  So, what does this say about the significance of these projects? Also, are the deadlines really useless, or do they have some real basis? (EA is not going to go broke because a Need For Speed game is a few months late, for example).<p>On the other subject of programmers being bad at estimation.  I&#x27;ve done a hell of a lot of introspection with regard to this and why I find estimates so unpleasant.  A few reasons that come to mind:<p>- When you&#x27;re asked for an estimate, what you&#x27;re often really being asked for is a deadline.<p>- In a sprint planning session, I&#x27;d often get asked to produce an estimate for &quot;how long will it take to design this?&quot; followed by an estimate of &quot;so how long will it take to implement?&quot;.  Which makes no sense - I can&#x27;t answer the second question without answering the first.  This often came up with bug fixes or &#x27;small&#x27; jobs - things that could reasonably be assumed to fall within a single sprint for at least some of the time.<p>- I feel like there&#x27;s an unspoken rule that your estimates relative to other team members signal your competency to the team and to your manager.  So if you&#x27;re constantly providing estimates that are longer than those made by other team members, it&#x27;s a bit like you&#x27;re saying &quot;I&#x27;m less capable than them&quot;.  You feel encouraged to provide short estimates and then hide the difference.  I see this come up most starkly when sprint planning wants consensus estimates, despite having team members of varying skill levels in the particular task being estimated.<p>- I find that &#x27;watching the clock&#x27; breaks my flow.  If I&#x27;m having to track my own time, it&#x27;s like a bit of cognitive load that I don&#x27;t want.  I don&#x27;t want to have to think about it, because losing your sense of time is so crucial to really being in-flow.  Often tools will ask you to enter how many hours you worked on something as part of tracking.  So you end up even guesstimating at that (&quot;well it felt like I spent half a day working on it, so I&#x27;ll put in 4 hours&quot;).<p>- As a result of the previous point, I don&#x27;t really collect historical data that I can reflect on.  It&#x27;d be great to be able to go back and see how long it actually took me to do stuff.  Not to mention that when you leave a company, you generally lose access to any historical performance information like that which you may have built up over the years.<p>There is a lot about Scrum that I like, but as a whole I agree it still suffers from the arbitrary deadlines problem.  I wonder if there&#x27;s a business acceptable way that you could do sprint-like activity, eschewing the idea of time estimation and replacing it with effort estimation only.  Rather than aggressively fixing the time through schedule, aggressively fix the scope of work and then just work towards completion &quot;until it&#x27;s done&quot;.",1404016579

With A/B testing and advertising, the publisher is attempting to sway user behaviour toward purchasing or some other goal which is usually obvious to the user.<p>With this experiment, Facebook are modifying the news feeds of their users specifically to affect their emotions, and then measure impact of that emotional change. The intention is to modify the feelings of users on the system, some negatively, some positively.<p>Intentional messing with human moods like this purely for experimentation is the reason why ethics committees exist at research organisations, and why informed consent is required from participants in experiments.<p>Informed consent in this case could have involved popping up a dialog to all users who were to be involved in the experiment, informing them that the presentation of information in Facebook would be changed in a way that might affect their emotions or mood.

Similar to the delusion that the country is somehow immune to totalitarianism, there exists a common assumption that martyrs, like dictators, only happen &quot;in those other, less free countries&quot;.<p>The very nature of what it means for someone to be a martyr basically guarantees that people will react strongly. This is why they can be a unifying force (&quot;we must ${dangerous_but_important_task} for ${martyr}!&quot;). This is also why the more talented oppressors take steps to prevent martyrs such as having them &quot;disappeared&quot;.<p>I see this situation as similar to the question of what to  do with the medical data acquired from the Nazi camps.

According to a simple reading of the code, you would not expect this to be a problem, because the method doesn&#x27;t attempt to access either of them (it&#x27;s equivalent to passing an invalid pointer to a C function, and then not accessing it).<p>However ARC subtly changes the semantics of the language. Strictly speaking, the parameters are supposed to be valid, as ARC adds retain/release calls for them (the fact that those are normally optimised away is purely that - an optimisation). So the bug here was that invalid pointers were being passed to a method which does actually use them (albeit non-obviously). As soon as retain was called on the invalid pointer, it ended up accessing or calling to some arbitrary location in memory, hence the crash.",1404014846

After all, if you produce a unique piece of software, you have &quot;first mover&quot; advantage; the only way someone can eat your lunch is if they a) copy you and b) market it better than you.<p>The two major ways you can be out-marketed are a) adding your product as a feature to a much larger, already successful product, and b) spending more money on marketing, adoption, and general product/market fit. (There is the possibility that you just get lucky on virality, like what happened with Flappy Birds, but that&#x27;s extremely unlikely).<p>&quot;The little guy&quot; is helped tremendously by patents, because he now has tremendous leverage against against a company that does one of these two things with his idea. They are forced to license the invention.<p>This, in turn, falls apart when the invention is &quot;obvious&quot; or in some way &quot;inevitable&quot;. This hurts both the big guy and the little guy - although arguably, it hurts the little guy even more than the possibility of theft, since the little guy is not spending his days reading patents.",1404014777

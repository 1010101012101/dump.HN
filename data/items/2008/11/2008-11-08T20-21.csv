We're all still here, and we have learned to greet such proclamations with yawns. Be more specific up front, and tone down the rhetoric. Consider a title like ""The IPv6 Routing Problem Will Soon Be Here"".<p>It's particularly important to be specific, to get to the point, and to adopt a tone of rational pragmatism when the topic is IPv6. IPv6 is to the ""OMG THE NET IS DOOMED"" genre as Nigerian princes are to spam. When I see the word my subconscious reflex is to intone ""YAGNI YAGNI YAGNI"" to myself as I click the Back button. When you write about IPv6, your first-order task is to convince the reader that you aren't just carrying on a long tradition of paranoia.",1226177753

On the other hand, you could easily miss great products that just need a little time to catch on—some products don't lend themselves to an immediate decision based on some web page ad copy.  For example, in <i>Founders at Work</i> Joel Spolsky talks about launching FogBugz:<p><i>We had no idea [how FogBugz would do]. At the time, you could have told me that this thing was going to sell zero copies, and I would have believed you. You could have also told me it was going to sell $50,000 a month's worth of copies—an equally unrealistic number—and I would have believed that too.<p>Now I have enough experience to know that almost everything you launch is going to sell $2,000 to 3,000 in the first month, and that's the way the first month of any software product always is, if you do things perfectly. But at the time, I just had no idea what to expect.</i>",1226177060

357811,comment,357485,357485,0,0,lacker,,,"Definitely either the G-1 or the iPhone.<p>For email on the G-1, since you have background processes, a little icon appears in the screen when you get new email or instant messages, and you can swipe it down, switch applications to chat for a bit, and then hit the ""back"" button to switch applications back to what you were doing. So it really makes it possible to do something else with your phone while you are carrying on an email or IM conversation. Same goes for calendar notifications. For this sort of thing I think the iPhone's one-button, one-task-at-a-time interface really hurts.<p>For general applications the iPhone is much better - there aren't that many applications in the G1 market yet. In general the larger screen and pinch gestures make it easier to use the web and maps on an iPhone.<p>For general operating system, I'm torn, because I like the extra buttons on the G1 (notably ""back"", ""home"", and ""contacts"" versus the iphone only having ""home"") so you can be doing something, send off an email, then resume what you were doing. But the UI is more intuitive on the iPhone, there are many little fluidly animated bits.<p>Hard to say...

Thus, they can meet the basic criteria for Godel's theorem to hold.  Godel's theorem states that for a formal system meeting these criteria, not all true statements can be generated from its rule base.<p>So, if we can say true statements are equivalent to use cases, and design patterns are equivalent to rule bases, then it may be demonstrable that software engineering is actually an unsolvable problem, at least in the large.

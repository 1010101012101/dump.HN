978021,comment,977658,977902,0,0,alexgartrell,,,"Agreed, at the end of the day, Programming is just structures and functions that operate on those structures.  Languages like Java tell you that's a ""class"" and do some extra nice book-keeping to make it much more clear to say dog.bark() (as opposed to, for example, dog->bark(dog) as you might do in C), but there's really nothing super fundamental about it.",1260013487

Often they find them because they do extensive testing!  This is not done to such a degree for scientific code.",1260013083

978007,comment,977658,977799,0,0,ComSubVie,,,"I'm currently reading ""How to write a lot"" from Paul J. Silvia, where he is saying that you shouldn't try to find time for writing, but you should allocate time for writing and start doing it.<p>This is very similar to this Tip #1, take your calendar, find a sport where you have time each week and allocate this time to coding (or to learn coding, you are also allowed to read books about coding in this time, or do your research regarding coding, etc. - but whatever you do, it should be relevant for coding).",1260012008

They read so much smoother than other large reference/learning books.<p>As for Design Patterns, the value in that was not that I learned any specific patterns, but rather that it got me to analyze software design in a systematic way rather than a ""I like this"" way.",1260011181

A gentle and entertaining introduction into the whole field of how to become an expert.<p>""Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware"" by Andy Hunt also spends an whole chapter on deliberate practice.\nIt's a very good book, too.<p>EDIT:\nThis blog post by Derek Sivers could be considered as an example of deliberate practice:\n<a href=""http://sivers.org/kimo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sivers.org/kimo</a>\nJust stumbled about it as a submission to HN, nice coincidence... :D",1260011075

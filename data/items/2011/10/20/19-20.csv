There was a stable transition in either case.<p>The issue isn't that anyone sympathizes with Gadaffi, but that it calls into question the solidarity and stability of the rebel government. Until now, Libyans have been united by their hatred of Gadaffi but we haven't seen whether the government can pull Libya together in a post-Gadaffi nation or really what kind of government or society will emerge. This execution was an action by Libyans with guns against the express will of the nominal government (which wanted to try him first.) It's a bad omen.",1319140780

3136615,comment,3135884,3136509,5,0,dholowiski,,,"From Wikipedia:<p>In 2005, Pogue was the subject of a conflict-of-interest controversy. In a New York Times review of a hard drive recovery service, Pogue noted that the service, which can cost from $500 to $2,700, was provided at no charge for the purposes of the review;[9] but when describing the service for National Public Radio's Morning Edition program on September 12, 2005,[10] he failed to mention this. NPR's Vice President of News Bill Marimow later stated that NPR should have either not aired the review or paid for the services itself.[10] Ultimately, the Times paid for the service.[9]\nAlso called into question was Pogue's impartiality on reviews of products for which he had authored a Missing Manual book. This controversy necessitated a response from Clark Hoyt, the Times' Public Editor on Pogue's role as a freelance journalist with external obligations.[11] In an op-ed piece, Hoyt wrote ""His multiple interests and loyalties raise interesting ethical issues in this new age when individual journalists can become brands of their own, stars who seem to transcend the old rules that sharply limited outside activity and demanded an overriding obligation to The Times and its readers.""[11] Of three ethicists consulted, each agreed Pogue's position created a ""clear conflict of interest"" and placed the paper on ""tricky ethical terrain."" In response, Pogue pledged to be more open with his conflicts of interest, and while he initially claimed that because he is not a journalist he is not bound by journalistic ethics,[12] he soon recanted and agreed to offer a full ""fanboy disclosure"" on his website.\nIn June 2011 Pogue gave a presentation at the Media Relations Summit[13] in which he credits P.R. personnel (of companies whose product he is reviewing) of providing most of his material for columns. The Times' reader representative started an inquiry, which led to Pogue being banned from any such appearances in the future.[14]",1319140648

The advice given is very general [besides the ""Post on a weekend"" suggestion]. Even as children we were told that ""sticks and stones may break our bones, but words will never hurt me"", a very early version of ""filter out the unhelpful"".<p>For me, if the advice seems obvious, I at least want to know how the author came to that observation, why it is beneficial, and how he will use it going forward. For example, check out this blog post on ""What I learned from watching notch code"":<p><a href=""http://gun.io/blog/what-i-learned-from-watching-notch-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gun.io/blog/what-i-learned-from-watching-notch-code/</a><p>You can see that while the author of this piece gave perhaps generic advice with things like ""incredibly thorough testing"", he told the story of what he observed, how it is beneficial, and at the end showed us how he would use that knowledge to improve himself. I didn't get that feeling with the OP's submission, such as when he said ""However, it is important to not take them personally. View it from a larger perspective. Why are they criticizing you? There must be a reason why. Try to understand them and see what you are able to do."" What did he do to understand the comments? How did he finally reach seeing it from a larger perspective? What was he ""able to do"" at the end? The author doesn't touch on this at all, and so all we are left for is very generic advice.<p>For example, with #5 as well, we get a single instance of how he used feedback to improve his product.

It is vastly underappreciated just how much the EPA has retarded energy development in the US. The retroactive revocation of permits for the\nmountaintop coal project, the Keystone XL imbroglio, and the hasty ban on offshore drilling are just a few examples. (Not many know that Deepwater Horizon was out that far because of regulations forbidding drilling closer to the shore).<p>These areas are inherently dirty and dangerous. It's always easy to do Monday morning quarterbacking, but little recognition of the fact that infrequent domestic oil spills may be preferable to endless foreign oil wars.<p>Resource extraction in general is demonized by the EPA just as much as the pharmaceutical industry is by the FDA. It is hard to regulate an industry which is respected by the public, because they will get some benefit of the doubt. But if they can be turned into polluters and poisoners, it is easy to justify ever greater state power over the sector.<p>Computers and the internet are in the exact opposite space: highly respected and almost entirely unregulated. So it's hard for many here to see what the fedguv means (they make App Store approval look like a walk in the park).<p>But once you're on the insides of those sectors, you start to realize that what is holding back oil in the West (and nuclear power, and drugs, and all non CS sectors) are human factors, not physical ones.

Though I'm optimistic about new nuclear technologies, I'm forced to agree that absent an unforeseen break-though in fusion, ""zero-point"", etc., Kurzweil's model is agnostic when it comes to extracting useful energy, and therefore could have an expiration date.<p>It's worth noting, however, that we'll never completely run out of energy, so long as Sol keeps burning. Can we sustain anything remotely resembling civilization based only on solar energy and its indirect organic by-products? Well, that's obviously debatable.<p>> Even if the energy problem is technically solvable, it seems to me that our political systems may be set up to do the absolute worst possible thing<p>Never doubt the self-interest of the powerful.

Loan terms should be manageable and repayment should start at time of profitability according to financial projections as stated in mandatory business plan drawn up by founders/loan seeker.

Having Amazon's even more walled-off fork of Android exist does nothing to help users of smartphones.<p>But your broad point is exactly right: we're all better served by working together on software instead of racing for parochial advantage by building on top of it without contributing to the whole.  Open Source has lots of big advantages, but to do it ""right"", there are costs to be borne as well.  The Linux community has on the whole found a pretty good balance between these concerns.  The Android community has had some pretty bad missteps.",1319138155

I think the point Rich is trying to make on that slide is that a bug in production passed the type checker and all the tests.  Therefore, tests are not <i>solving</i> the problem of building high quality systems.<p>Rather, tests (and type safety) are ""guardrails"" that warn when you when you are doing something wrong (they are reactive). As Rich said on Twitter (<a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/richhickey/status/116490495500357633"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/richhickey/status/116490495500357633</a>), ""I have nothing against guard rails, but let's recognize their limited utility in trip planning and navigation.""<p>I believe that linking back to the greater context, Rich is saying that simplicity and doing more to think about your problem at the beginning (proactive steps) provide value in building systems that are high quality and easy to maintain.  I think he is at least implicitly challenging whether the value you get from simplicity is greater than the value you get from an extensive test suite.<p>I do not hear his comments as anti-testing, but rather more as pro-thinking and pro-simplicity.  Personally, I find tests useful. I write them when writing Clojure code.  However, I also get tremendous value from focusing on abstraction and composability and simplicity in design.",1319138153

3136410,comment,3134577,3135591,4,0,wnewman,,,"It seems to me that Kurzweil is on rather strong grounds when he argues in effect that 25Mbytes is a safe conservative upper bound on the information needed to specify a human infant brain. The relevant information content of the epigenetic stuff is unlikely to be tens of megabytes, and extremely unlikely to be hundreds of megabytes. Otherwise, it's hard to see how we could've overlooked such a high proportion of non-DNA design information being passed around in all the work being done on genetics. It's also hard to see how so much extra information would stay stable against mutation-ish pressures unless its copy error rate was much lower than DNA, and hard to see how we'd've overlooked all the machinery that would accomplish that.<p>Moreover, I think 25M bytes is probably a very conservative upper bound, so that the relevant uncompressable complexity of what computer scientists need to design for general AI is likely no more than 1M bytes. A lot of actual brain stuff is likely to be description of the physical layer that silicon engineers won't care about, because they do the physical layer in a completely different way (silicon and masks and resists and hardest of hard UV and two low digital voltages, not wet tendrils groping toward each other in the dark and washing each other with neurotransmitters). A significant amount of actual brain stuff is likely to be application layer stuff that we don't need (e.g., the Bearnaise sauce effect, and fear of heights and snakes) and optimizations that we don't strictly need (all sorts of shortcuts for visual processing and language grammar and so forth, when more general-purpose mechanisms would still suffice to pass a Turing test). A lot of brain stuff is likely to be stuff in common with a fish, much of which we already know how to implement from scratch. And all brain stuff seems pretty likely to be encoded rather inefficiently: lots of twisty little protein substructures and nucleic acid binding sites are unlikely to be nearly as concise as the kind of mathematical or programming language notation that describes what's going on.<p>When Kurzweil writes ""do not appreciably add"" I understand him to be willing to stand by roughly the quantitative information theoretical claims I made at first (25Mbytes, tens of Mbytes, hundreds of Mbytes). When you write ""profoundly wrong ... add hugely"" I am unable to tell what you are claiming. How many uncompressable bits of design information you are talking about? Perhaps you believe that natural selection pounded out and mitosis reliably propagates 200M uncompressable bytes of brain design information? or 1G bytes? As above, I think that is probably false. Or perhaps I should read ""hugely"" as ""vitally"" and understand that you merely mean that the epigenetic information might be less than a million uncompressable bytes but still if you corrupt it badly you have a dead or hopelessly moronic infant. If that's what you mean, I think you are factually correct, but also don't think that that fact contradicts Kurzweil's argument.",1319138121

Southern California is a different issue, but this isn't going to help the places where the housing market really took a shit, like Nevada and Arizona, because the market there is saturated with foreclosures of homes that might have originally sold for 500k but are probably worth half that much in the current market.  The poisonous idea is that these homes were actually worth that much money, but they never were.  The artificial demand of the sub-prime mortgage crisis pushed prices up where they should never had been.  The 500k limit would try to, again, artificially inflate the worth of the house by stimulated demand in the highest priced homes, homes which should probably sell closer to 350, because the 150k premium might be worth it for some families to get a visa.  The second problem with this thinking is that anyone who qualifies for a 500k house would likely be rich enough to get a visa in the US anyways as an investor.<p>A lower limit of 150k would be reasonable for boosting the middle class, and actually helping the housing market, but that's obviously not the goal.",1319137985

They actually asked us ""would you mind being part of a documentary on your experience filmed by Bloomberg?"". We didn't mind. I did not feel it was forced on us. They asked politely, and we agreed enthusiastically. We really wanted to be in TechStars.<p>TechStars was a great experience for me. I lived/worked for 4 months, 20 hours a day, shoulder-to-shoulder with 40 among the brightest people you can find in the US which now become my closest friend. It did not matter what we were doing or where, we were all helping each other succeed, sharing experiences, contacts, reviewing pitches, etc. And even now, 6 months later, we still speak often and have tons of fun every time we see each other. It's a family.<p>But that's not all, TechStars allowed us to meet and bond with dozens of the greatest and smartest investors and CEOs of the United States. They helped us, coached us, and pushed us to the our best at all time. And even now that the show is over, they are reaching out, helping out, and creating connections for us. It is great. Simply great.<p>We really all feel part of a big group which I am sure will last forever.<p>Having the cameras around during the program was actually fun, at least for me. The crews became friends and it was normal to have them around. They did not change a bit what we were doing and how: they did not tell us what to say, they did not create drama, they did not ask gotcha-questions. Of course, compressing 5000 hours of video in less than 2 hours of show forced them to do some liberal editing. And I am sure that lots of things changed at Bloomberg between January and last Tuesday. They had to focus on 6 companies instead of 11, pick some characters instead of the teams, and reduce hours of meetings into a few seconds.<p>Melanie is great and is already running with a new idea. The show did not portray her that way. Too bad. Same thing for the meeting with my co-founder, they should have skipped the money troubles of Jason, it did not help anybody. But that's show-business I guess, and since everything during the program went so smooth and it was so positive, they probably had to focus on those two moments to create a bit of drama, which, given the amount of ""reality"" on TV nowadays, seem to be necessary.<p>I highly, highly, highly, highly, highly, highly, highly... :) recommend submitting your application to TechStars and do your best to be accepted into the program.

You may have picked the wrong audience.<p>Also, in regards to this post, you've let your dissatisfaction with HN's receptiveness towards your idea get the best of you. One submission and a ""lessons learned"" follow up post five days later is not a sign that you've externalized negative feedback or that you've been able to collect sufficient data to pontificate over the HN submission process and provide useful advice for others. If anything, you should create a marketing campaign, gather and interpret your data and use it to back up your assumptions.<p>Either way, I wish you the best of luck with your endeavors. Based on what I've seen so far, you're far ahead than many people your age.<p>ps. Yes, I've been to Singapore. It's okay.",1319137650

Certainly, there are plenty examples of business having undue influence in government. But likewise, there are examples of government having undue influence in business[1].<p>The one thing I've heard anyone in OWS suggest that I can get behind is a separation of business and state.<p>Too often, the regulatory machine helps business (see Regulatory Capture[2]) -- and this cuts in many directions, like the governmental support of labor unions, as in the recent Boeing case. But it would still be a mistake to go to the other extreme and have the behemoth of government <i>driving</i> business.<p>It seems to me that the Economist is right, and getting the government to just get the heck out is the best solution. They shouldn't do anything to help or hinder[3] business.<p>[1] How often have we heard various content industries (movies, music, video games, comic books) promise to ""self-regulate"" lest government pass some threatened laws.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture</a><p>[3] short of ensuring that business is conducted fairly, e.g., protecting us from fraud, helping ensure disclosure, etc.",1319137637

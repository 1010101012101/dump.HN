There is this other comment which says that if she punched him, she would risk an assault accusation.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s the whole &quot;somebody has to be a victim&quot; mentality? Maybe it&#x27;s lot less clear cut in most cases.<p>I have to say, I would much prefer women to simply slap the men who do these uncomfortable things. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it. Now if this would escalate afterwards, perhaps then should courts (or other institutions) be involved.<p>> you should be careful that people don&#x27;t accidentally think that you&#x27;re ascribing blame to the victim<p>I don&#x27;t agree, the people who think that are the ones making an error, and we shouldn&#x27;t accommodate them.<p>How can we have an honest discussion about what is moral and what not, if we have the need to blame somebody? The blame can only come after it is decided what action is immoral, and understanding circumstances. Assigning who is a victim in advance prevents this understanding.<p>> It is interesting that you imply that in previous generations, there were no victims<p>I don&#x27;t think he does, it&#x27;s the faulty reasoning of yours  (as you say in the previous sentence) that leads to conclusion that there is always 100% victim and 100% perpetrator.<p>> the evidence I have that indicates that sexual assault and other such crimes have been with us for a long time<p>I agree, that is very much true. But there is also other side of the coin, people (of both sexes!) are taking risks to get good sexual partners, it&#x27;s just human nature. Ignoring the fact that people sometimes risk (and it fails!) in the interest of declaring somebody a victim does no good either.<p>I mean, even if you move the boundary of what is acceptable in society (in either direction), there will always be people who will risk to cross the boundary, because that risk pays off. So I am not sure what is bigger involvement of institutions in these matters going to resolve.<p>It&#x27;s one of the blind spots of left and feminism (I am leftist), we don&#x27;t want to hear about people who do take risks (because it&#x27;s slightly irrational, after all), because our ideology cannot deal with them in any meaningful way.<p>And personally, I see the mere existence of bosses (and human social hierarchies in general) as a bigger problem, of which sexual harassment is only a symptom.",1453211807

I get the impression that the &quot;victim&quot; here is trying to take advantage of the situation. She never asks the inappropriate person to stop here, instead goes to HR. I mean just in plain words &quot;Please don&#x27;t, this is inappropriate.&quot; would stop most such behavior from happening again in huge majority of cases.<p>> During the HR investigation that ensued, I remember being shamed by a female colleague who thought I was blowing the situation out of proportion. She thought I was being overly sensitive, and that it was wrong of me to report my manager. That hurt. I thought she would’ve naturally supported me.<p>&quot;Being shamed&quot;? What if that female colleague honestly thought that she was blowing the situation out of proportion? A mere disagreement is shaming? Just because someone thinks they are &#x27;sexually harassed&#x27; doesn&#x27;t make them right automatically. I mean is there any scenario where someone claiming they are harassed could be on the wrong side of the things (or blowing things out of proportion)? It seems the SF/valley area atleast is too politically correct to even entertain the possibility that the female could possibly be wrong or making a mistake. Anyone that doesn&#x27;t agree with a narrow notion of SJW equality is literally the devil. And this sort of trend has made &#x27;being victim&#x27; a somewhat coveted status that can be used for gaining publicity/career advances.",1453211499

If you are not rich and want to visit the museums and galleries of Chicago, or attend a Bears game at the stadium, or a music concert, you can&#x27;t live in Chicago because then you&#x27;d be too poor, you have to live elsewhere and visit.<p>What dense, expensive, low standard of living areas provide, is extremely dense employment.  No matter how unique your job is, there&#x27;s dozens to thousands of positions within walking distance of your current employer.  In the more rural areas you&#x27;ll see a lot more sinecure behavior, retired in place, people who&#x27;ve worked the same place for 20 years, nobody (such as yourself) gets promoted because the company doesn&#x27;t grow and nobody quits, etc.  Long term relationships are comfortable and lower stress on average, yet also less exciting and less adventurous, just like with love life.<p>There are also minor behavior constraints.  If there&#x27;s 50 companies all doing the same thing in a big city, then stack ranking basically wastes a lot of HR money pointlessly shuffling people every year, but at least its possible, whereas in a rural area especially if its a company town, stack ranking would rapidly destroy the company because the applicant pool is too small to sustain bad behavior.  As a gross generalization people tend to spend far less time commuting in rural areas than urban, but the rural commute has more (high speed) miles so it is more expensive, in the city a twice a day rush hour commute might waste more than two hours of precious life per day, but at least its short therefore cheap, whereas in the country it&#x27;ll be a comparatively lightning fast 30 minutes each way, but at 80 MPH and 50 cents per mile, that&#x27;ll be an expensive 40 mile daily commute.

Our obsession with apps. This is something that really needs to be culled too. One of the biggest factor that makes the &quot;sexy IoT&quot; barely usable is that every device has its own app. Which means, every company gets to develop a shit UI (each crappy in different way), and the time it takes to switch between apps is several seconds. This should all be standardized - I should have just <i>one</i> app for all my IoT, and it definitely must <i>not</i> be made by one of the vendors (for the same reason nobody uses software provided by e.g. printer vendors).",1453210311

Because the local population which runs these operations will always have the upper hand and as long as the conditions exist that make it more likely for children to end up digging up rare earths for your smartphone or diamonds for your tennis bracelet this won&#x27;t change.<p>I hope the day would come where a company like Apple could be brave enough to come out and say look we can&#x27;t buy Cobalt which wasn&#x27;t mined by kids, but we made a calculation that if we could it would be 17% more expensive so we are jacking our own prices by 17% and transferring the difference to X Y and Z in hopes that in 20 years we could buy Cobalt which was not only not mined by children but also mined by miners with life expectancy which is longer than our yearly product cycle.<p>But as long as people would keep on yelling boycott this and boycott that it will never happen and the only thing Apple can do is to continue to play the pass the hot potato game with it&#x27;s suppliers (which will continue to restructure and change names to be put back into that list) and maybe have Tim Cook do an apologetic we are the world cover...",1453209708

Definitions are hard for this subject, but my understanding is the phrase escalates with severity from misconduct->harassment->assault.<p>I agree that the manager was in the wrong, but I worry about a culture that cannot readily distinguish the severity of conduct, and in-turn come up with an appropriate response.<p>In this scenario, I feel going to HR was appropriate, but I also feel this writing takes an overly hostile tone, instead of one focused on improvement.  I&#x27;d find this tone appropriate if there were more pushback from HR, or if harassment continued and HR wouldn&#x27;t help resolve.  But as far as I can tell, OP is happy with HRs response.<p>Perhaps instead we can explore what HR can and should do to prevent self-confidence issues at the conclusion of these investigations?  To me, that would be more beneficial than asking others to pursue a path which - all things being similar - results in self-doubt.",1453209701

(In all honestly, women have told me too more  personal things (sexual in nature) at work, over men.  The big difference is these women had no power over my career.<p>And the difference is they weren&#x27;t &quot;hitting&quot; on me.  When I was a younger man--yes some where, but I handled the situation.  (I guarantee now they are just yacking about sex, and their  personal stuff.)The last thing I wanted to hear on a Monday was a story about Shirly&#x27;s elder son walking in on her and her new boy friend &quot;rattling the bed&quot;.  I still can&#x27;t get that image out of my head, and it&#x27;s been 20 years.<p>Actually, I have found both sexes guilty of talking about their sex life at work.  It could be intimate details of the date you had on Friday night, or how your mate isn&#x27;t attentive to your needs any more. I&#x27;ve never liked hearing personal stuff about my coworkers.  Of course, I never said anything, because it was innocent conversation at the time, but if I was an attractive female, or a young attractive male, I might have thought differently.<p>Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t talk about this stuff at work.

We see the cute baby bump, or suffer through how hard it was to fertilize the egg. (Guys like me look at it as a tragedy, not something great.)   People talk way too much at work.  In my experience, most are lonely and don&#x27;t have close friends, and use workers as free friends, and free therapy.  We don&#x27;t want to hear it.  The jokes are worn out.  It&#x27;s just done.  Find friends outside of work to dazzle with your stories.  I know finding friends is very hard. It&#x27;s even harder, if all you have concentrated on is work since that first job out of college.<p>And yes, some are sexual predators.  I&#x27;ve seen them in most work places.

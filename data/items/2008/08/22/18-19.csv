284057,comment,283908,283908,0,0,mojombo,,,"I find this to be excellent advice. This is exactly the approach we took at GitHub almost down to the letter. It took about 2 months until the site was good enough to use to host the GitHub source, another month until we started private beta with invites, and three more months until public launch.<p>Artificial scarcity is a great technique to generate excitement for a product while also limiting growth to a rate that won't melt your servers. We worked through a huge number of problems and early users gave us some of the ideas that have defined GitHub. By doing a Hollywood launch, things would have been very different and I am convinced, very much worse.<p>Do not, I repeat, DO NOT underestimate how much your users will help you to define your product. If you launch without having significant user feedback time, you've essentially thrown away a massive (and free) focus group study.<p>Let me also say that when we finally did our public launch, there was plenty of buzz, and all of it was the RIGHT kind of buzz. The buzz that attracts real, lasting customers (and no, we weren't on TechCrunch, that traffic is garbage).",1219431511

And Ruby's lambda's for the most part don't suck.<p>But ruby's methods really do suck, and so do the complex construction of Blocks. While I recognize that blocks allow you to do weird things (like use return on the calling scope), the fact that they necessitate a special form (yield) and cannot be bound to a variable, and are not passed as standard function parameters just makes them inconsistent and gross.<p>Methods which aren't first class functions (but can be transformed into one with the helpful helper function!) also suck, and passing those around in a functional way is just a lesson in futility.<p>All that being said, I have much more faith in these warts being fixed as time goes on, than python's nasty lambda, and the gross over use of dunders.",1219431399

284033,comment,283639,283914,0,0,maxklein,,,"Well, you prove the point. You are incapable of seeing your own weaknesses in a language.<p>One can write every language the same way, but that's not programming. You can't learn python and then write C the python way. You can't write Python as you would Java.<p>Syntactically, it's possible, but that's a different language you are using then.<p>Don't confuse syntax or knowing when to use particular constructs with knowing a language. Call me slow, but it took me 3 years before I felt confident that I really knew most of C++. I know when to use Boost, when to use STD, What AtlArray is, how to write an IDL file, what extern 'C' does, what an stdcall is, how my variables are layed on my stack, what Gui toolkits are available, how Borland C++ makes properties appear in C++ classes, when one should use an int64, etc.<p>It takes time to learn that stuff, but to be really good at a language, you need to know it.<p>We're like doctors, you don't need to apply your knowledge all the time, but when you need it, you need to be aware of what exists and where to look it up.<p>If they ask me - write a webserver under Windows, I need to instantly be able to think of 3-4 libraries I could use for the low level stuff, and then decide which is best. All that takes time.<p>The syntax is nothing. A language is a whole lot more than that. You can't stay above a language. You need to delve into the language, you need to have a feeling for the language, you need to feel inside you how to express things in a particular programming language.<p>When you describe a problem to me, I can see the C++ structure in my minds eye. I can mentally walk through the code, see where I would use templates, where I would use an interface class, where I would subclass and so on.<p>I can't do the same with python, because even though I know the syntax, I've not used it long enough to get an extreme feel for the language. And the python folks like to reduce stuff down to short lines, and that's something you don't do in C++.<p>Learning a programming language is learning a new way to think. Not a new way to string sentences together.",1219430567

283971,comment,283639,283967,0,0,tptacek,,,"You say ""both languages are just a mess"" as if to equate the two. But there's no comparison.<p>Your Ruby problem with blocks and Proc objects is a nit about elegance and semantics. How often does the difference between an actual Proc object and a block actually affect you? More importantly, if the cost of fixing that nit is that we wind up with Lisp's or Javascript's lambda notation, who would accept that? Javascript has relatively consistent semantics for anonymous functions, but extremely clumsy syntax.<p>Python simply doesn't have real lambdas. It has the ability to pass something called a lambda in place of a function, and that something forces you to think about things like the difference between a statement and an expression. It then tells you that you don't in fact want anonymous functions, but instead you want to define tens of itty bitty named functions and use them instead. You also ""want"" that ""self"" argument to all your methods, and you ""want"" to tack two underscores to the front of your method names to make them private.<p>So, I half agree with you. Yes, it would be nice if there was a (zero-cost) way of fixing Ruby's block semantics. Yes, I can rely on Lisp's lambda semantics slightly more than I can on Ruby's, which does start to matter when you start writing domain-specific language code. But I don't agree that this has any bearing on the Python vs. Ruby argument. Python lambdas suck.",1219428143

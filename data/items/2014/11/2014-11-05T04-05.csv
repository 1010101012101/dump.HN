And I still struggle with it.<p>Growing up &#x27;smart&#x27; made me stupid.<p>I had tests and things, I was marked for inclusion in the TAG program. I got poor grades not because I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to do the work, but because the work bored the hell out of me and I refused to do homework and thus allow it to intrude upon fun time away from that tedium (I suspect I also dealt with some undiagnosed ADHD; it runs in the family).<p>The problem though is that when everything comes easy, and you&#x27;re never given much opportunity and encouragement to challenge yourself, then you also become prone to getting frustrated and confused whenever something <i>isn&#x27;t</i> coming easily. You&#x27;re not accustomed to that kind of failure, to not just knowing off the bat or at least being able to pick it up on the fly.<p>So you give up on things a lot. When you get out into the real world, you wind up with a complex. That stuff that made you &#x27;smart&#x27; isn&#x27;t actually that useful outside of certain areas, so on a &#x27;regular job&#x27; you&#x27;re still functionally useless.<p>As a kid in the 90s, at the beginning of the great tech boom, the .com crash still on the horizon, you were inundated with messages that said that because you were smart and knew computers you were somehow just on a free ride to be the next Bill Gates. When the reality is that most of the kids who did go that route wound up broke in &#x27;99, and the rest just never got that far in the first place.<p>I genuinely worry that the current startup culture and the push for &#x27;start an app!&#x27; programs in schools are headed the same way. Selling tech and &#x27;being smart&#x27; as an automatic win at life, which isn&#x27;t true at all, and 90% of those kids finishing &#x27;accelerated learning&#x27; courses in programming will be lucky to grow up writing backend code for a medical insurance billing provider.",1415163421

Do people feel comfortable admitting mistakes? Is the group unified in motivated and introspective problem solving towards a shared goal? Hopefully the answers to the above are all yes. Where they are yes, how did someone foster those conditions?<p><i>Maybe if I were a manager, I could bring up such concerns in a one-on-one meeting, but if they seem reasonably happy but privately feel excluded, how am I supposed to know?</i><p>I think managers are precisely the ones to foster such atmospheres. I suspect that sub-cultural monocultures (cliques) are much easier to form than very self-aware groups. Also, technical issues are easier to talk about and settle arguments around. Social issues are difficult because they deal with so many things on the boundaries of our conscious awareness.<p>EDIT: In fairness, it seems likely that some of the steps she took to try and fit in may have contributed to her alienation.

He&#x27;s likely the single most capable adversary the HN/EFF/ACLU/Cato/Mozilla/etc. axis faces over encryption (if he ends up playing that role).<p>Stewart is correct that end-to-end crypto will &quot;restrict [companies&#x27;] ability to sell&quot; products internationally. And he is narrowly correct that &quot;the market for absolute encryption is more limited than you might think&quot; in a corporate environment. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak4ZwLU3aX0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak4ZwLU3aX0</a> [8:45]<p>But these are merely clever rhetorical devices. Of course Apple/Google/FB/etc. know that HTTPS will vex snoophappy governments; at this point I suspect their CEOs may view that as a welcome side effect and in any case know their business better than a DC attorney does. And of course banks and brokerage firms don&#x27;t want end-to-end encryption for their employees; they have likely have FINRA and other legal obligations to preserve correspondence.<p>Okay, Russia and China are snoophappy and banks may want access to employees&#x27; email. Now can we go back to talking about the NSA&#x27;s bulk surveillance of law-abiding Americans?<p>Stewart&#x27;s comments at 12:56 about Silicon Valley companies &quot;picking fights&quot; with the NSA are also misleading. In reality, the NSA was &quot;picking fights&quot; by bulk-tapping Google&#x27;s interdata center links, subverting encryption standards, and (in the 1990s) defending export controls that weakened American companies&#x27; ability to compete.

His simplified example -- a hotel doorman can know the number of people entering and leaving, hence the surface (doorman) can encode information about the volume (hotel) -- does not help. For the doorman/surface to know <i>everything</i> about the volume/hotel, she would require (1) to have been continuously present from the inception of the volume and (2) to have some means or medium of encoding the information about <i>everything</i> that entered or left the volume.

8560557,comment,8559519,8560230,0,0,acemarke,,,"That&#x27;s pretty much the argument I had to make on my current project.  We&#x27;ve got an internal smart client app-in-a-browser that we built last year after throwing away a legacy system.  Unfortunately, we were on a tight deadline, and most of the team had little serious JS experience.  The client codebase just grew grew randomly, with no real architecture or design, and turned into a giant maze of nested jQuery callbacks and 2000-3000 line JS files.  I&#x27;d suggested we look into some MVC frameworks before we started development, but then I wound up working on a separate task and no one had time to actually go research, select, and train everyone on a new framework.  During the development process, one dev in particular was busy building his own little framework from scratch.  Looking at it later, he was basically reinventing Backbone.View, including templating and saving a jQuery reference.<p>After we hit our initial development deadline, we had time to actually research Angular, Ember, and Backbone.  We settled on Backbone on the grounds that we could refactor our codebase incrementally, and it seemed to fit our use case best.  Unfortunately, this later led to clashes with the &quot;write it myself&quot; dev, as he didn&#x27;t want to use any outside frameworks beyond jQuery.<p>Anyway, having used Backbone for the last year, it definitely has a lot of limitations, but it also provides a very definite set of well-tested pieces that clearly help solve common development use cases.  So yeah, very much in agreement with you there.  Why try to totally build something from scratch if someone else has already done it for you, and it&#x27;s been battle-tested by other developers?",1415162930

It doesn&#x27;t matter how much content the initial page had on it, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t mean that you send an empty body tag.

Frameworks like Angular encourage you to use a &quot;service&quot; mindset that capitalizes on this property.<p>The longer you use a single page app, the fewer round trips you will have. If you ask me, your communication should only be for raw materials (scripts, templates) that you won&#x27;t need to validate or request again during the current session, and raw data (json).  This is more loosely coupled, more cacheable at all the different levels, and more scalable in large part due to the decoupling.<p>Once the initial view loads, I totally agree that you should intelligently precache all your resources and data asynchronously in the background to usher in the era of near zero-latency user interactions.

How about measuring how curious, flexible, and effective they are figuring out where things went wrong and understanding how to avoid the problem in the future?<p>I propose that an atmosphere of openness and mutual trust that can even encompass issues around race and gender would make for a group that&#x27;s head and shoulders more effective than most.",1415160769

The main pattern I noticed was Harvard (i was applying in management). Even more so, the guys interviewing me were extremely talented and smart. What always weirded me out was... the problems they work on are not that difficult.  Once you grasp sharding and operations, you are pretty much set. These guys are <i>not</i> the Manhattan project.  The true hard problems in their space: developing their own mobile hardware, keeping teens engaged, pushing the boundaries of design, losing tracking systems in mobile, etc; they don&#x27;t face head on.

My boss/owner of the business abused a provision in the California unemployment system designed for seasonal lulls in labor pools. When ever I was out of work to do, I was sent home and those hours were paid for by the state at the usual unemployment rate. I was doing high level graphic production and design to which I am quite skilled. At crunch time I can get through mountains of work quickly. Then at normal work flows I could quickly run out of work if I gave it my all. Then there was days of work trickling in... Annoyed me to no end. Here I am in the best paying job I&#x27;d had so far in my career and the only time in my life I&#x27;ve been on unemployment all at the same time. I was making enough at full hours to pay bills and have a decent lifestyle but boy did that unemployment rate cut in to that. I became a master of looking really busy doing absolutely nothing. Or working a quick half hour job in to an hour and a half. Of course it helped the other hat I wore at the job was being the main IT guy...",1415160672

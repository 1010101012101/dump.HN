If you've been working on something for awhile it gets simpler. Keep in mind that what at first appears complex, will get simpler.<p>2) He whose work is most incomprehensible, is most respected.<p>Unfortunately, this is the bane of our industry. The ignorant are impressed by incomprehensibility. It all seems like magic to them and the more incomprehensible an aura you surround yourself in, the more respect you will get. This is not the same as arrogance. Arrogance will not get you respect. People may put up with you, but they won't respect you.<p>3) Never be a maintenance programmer. Always be the original coder.<p>For me, it's very easy to take a spec and create a system. It's much harder to clean up someone else's mess. I call it, ""Being handed a turd and told to make it float"". In fact, just the fact that a ""maintenance programmer"" is needed means the code is more or less a mess. Unless you are about to get thrown out on the street for lack of money, never work on someone else's code. It's 3 times harder but you get paid less and get less respect.<p>4) All programmers hate other programmer's code.<p>It's always going to be too complex. Other guys code always sucks.

What the author does not say is that a lot of those people live with their parents - and their whole income is expendible. I don't know if this phenomeneon started after the bubble economy, but it is quite shocking.<p>Living in larger family units is actually very efficient. The way we do things here in the U.S. is actually shockingly inefficient. Parents buy big houses in the suburbs when they have kids, and don't down size when the kids leave. So you have an older couple using one floor of an oversized house and the kid maintaining a separate household. Then when the kid has kids, they buy another big house in the suburbs, then pay someone thousands of dollars a month to take care of said kids after school. Meanwhile the grandparents sit around their big house bored and lonely.<p>There are a lot of weird cultural taboos in the U.S. that create this state of affairs, but the end result is vast inefficiency in resource usage compared to societies where bigger households are the norm.",1326048129

If long-term, sustained economic growth that spreads prosperity around the general population is the goal, then it is certainly possible to have too much governmental intervention, governmental intervention that denies employers flexibility and keeps the masses from helping themselves through free enterprise.<p>Your comment mentioned ""affirmative action"" in the context of college admission, and hived off many subcomments of varying quality. College admission practices in the United States are partly constrained by federal regulations (applicable to all colleges, government-run or privately run, that receive federal grants or admit students who receive federal financial aid) and partly constrained by state law in some states or by agreements in NCAA athletic conferences. Not all colleges have the same admission policy. Few people are aware that Harvard, which endeavors to interview all applicants for undergraduate admission and receives application forms with the applicant's real name in all cases, nonetheless reports to the federal government that 12 percent of its undergraduates are ""race/ethnicity unknown.""<p><a href=""http://members.ucan-network.org/harvard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://members.ucan-network.org/harvard</a><p>In United States federal law, all colleges are required to ask their applicants and enrolled students questions about federal defined ""race"" and ""ethnicity"" categories.

It may be that she particularly likes being at Caltech just because it is reputed to admit qualified applicants, period, without consideration of issues that don't pertain to the applicant's ability to succeed in a legendarily tough academic program. Throughout the United States, when organizations make clear what personal characteristics they are looking for, and what benefits there are to joining [insert name of college here, or insert name of employer here], then young people of all varieties of ethnic groups step up and develop the qualifications.

And the App Store is an incredibly stressful environment because essentially you only get 2 weeks to settle into a rank that will be the basis of your success. If you fuck it up, you're pretty much done because discovery on the app store is broken.<p>I work for a social game company that has invested orders of magnitude more time and money into figuring out the best route to launch an app, and even they recognize that even after all their analysis and beta-testing, they too can fail.  But they have the most disciplined process to give them the best shot at winning. I'll offer a few pieces of advice from seeing their launch process:<p>1)  Beta test internally until the app is ""good enough"" for launch.  Bugs are ok.  Put in monetization features immediately and test.<p>2a)  Come up with a target rank you want to achieve (both safe and stretch) and figure out how you need to get there.  For example, if your goal is to get into the top 10 free games, you need to have around 1.5 million downloads a month.  To get into the top 25, you need about 1 million.  Understanding these targets helps hone your strategy.<p>2b)  You can't afford to not do some initial projections in your industry.  For a free-to-play game as an example, DAU and churn and Lifetime Value are important metrics. You need to setup some initial benchmarks for these metrics, so you can gauge if you're being ""successful"" in your launch.<p>3) Don't launch in the U.S initially.  As you've found out, you only get one chance, and the U.S is a huge market to fuck up.  One great thing about the App Store is that it has geo-targeting built into its distribution, so launch in a much smaller market that might validate your idea. We chose New Zealand, because its a large enough market to beta-test an idea, but ""Whatever Happens in New Zealand Stays In New Zealand"" as our marketing director put it.<p>4) If you fuck up a beta-tested market, don't worry, theres about 25 others that you can use before launching in the ""mainstream"" markets.<p>5) You will have to pour money into ads, but you only have to do it for 2 weeks because ranking in the App Store is determined by velocity of downloads. So as soon as you launch, target with any ad-system you can get your hands on from Admob, InMobi, Facebook, Google, TapJoy, whatever. This will cost you lots of money, but this is what it takes to succeed. There is simply too much competition in the App Store.",1326046499

Contrary to the FUD that seems to be popular opinion on HN, it's a cake walk. Most importantly, learning how to use torrents is a (rather small) <i>one-time</i> time investment, whereas watching TV means that you <i>perenially</i> waste 1/4th of your viewing time watching ads. And don't forget that you have to keep track of when shows are airing and either watch them then or remember to record them for later viewing.<p>So if saving time is one of your primary concerns, <i>the numbers simply don't add up in favor of broadcast TV</i>, no matter how you look at them.<p>In fact, piracy is <i>so</i> easy that I won't even bother with free solutions like Hulu - why should I waste my time traversing 10 different sites looking for a particular episode of a particular show I want to see when I can go to the <i>same</i> torrent site <i>every</i> time and have a virtual <i>guarantee</i> that the content I want will be instantly available, and in HD, at that?<p>If you have moral qualms with respect to piracy, I can agree to disagree, despite my personal lack of objections to the practice.

Most likely the only real reason they did mercurial first, was not any that they stated, but the fact that it was written in Python, so it was easier to port to their server tools; they mentioned something like that as a reason for the delay for Git support in their issue tracker.<p>And Git doesn't require any third party install, so that's inaccurate.<p>And yes, I mentioned in my blog post that I was biased, however, I can be biased and arrive to the right conclusion.

It's totally different to see someone work _with you_ on a project than to rummage around their commits to project you don't really know. The point is to see how it is to collaborate with someone, and that has to be a first-person experience (or take the word of someone you really value, but that's not what you get form random GitHub projects).

I just like trying to keep things simple.<p>I've noticed lately that almost everyone of my fellow programmers seem to be immersed in fads and other like things.  The rest seem to try and make some of the most simple problems in the world into some of the most complex problems in the world.<p>Then I look at Ad's out there and it says they are looking for top programmers and these 'rock stars' out there.  Not only do they ask for that, they also seem to give out these super brain teasers and ask questions about overcomplicated specifications like they are the holy grail of good programming and I should be writing programs like them!  (In my opinion, the only reason I see a lot of specs end up that way is because two people couldn't agree on something so they compromised on the worst of the two ideas to move on.)<p>Well, after spending hours listening to people talk about stuff way over my head just to realize all they are talking about is something rather simple - I feel very unhireable by my fellow programmers except for the lowest level programming job or simple CRUD jobs.",1326045801

I am really satisfied every day, though, that everything I do all day long is really meaningful.

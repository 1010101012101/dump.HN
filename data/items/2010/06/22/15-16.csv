With an S election you are allowed to pay yourself a reasonable salary that is subject to the employment tax while shielding the rest as profit dividend which unlike a C corp are pass through and not subject to corporate taxes. so the taxes on that portion is (0%) so yes if you elect to file any thing other than an S-Corp then you are paying 15.3% on income you would be paying 0% so it is not 7.x% it is 15.3% that you are loosing.<p><i>Also, the arguable tax advantages of s-corps are likely being reduced or eliminated soon via impending legislation in the US, so don't choose that for tax reasons.</i><p>That is the worst advice that I have ever heard.

When we are talking about current, we are not talking about how many electrons are moving, but about the transfer of energy from one place to another. The water analogy just doesn't work, because while the current itself flows at nearly the speed of light, the electrons themselves move very slowly. In an AC current, the electrons don't flow at all. They vibrate. And in a liquid, the energy transfer can just as well be by means of anion flowing backwards, as cations flowing forward. Yet we think of the current as only flowing in one direction. You see the problem? Trying to think of electrical energy as a ""flow of electrons"" OR a ""flow of protons"" completely skews one's understanding of what is taking place.",1277221620

You have to go through some hassle to set it up, and you have to maintain it at a minimal financial cost and possibly more significant paperwork time cost. If properly maintained it provides some legal protection of your personal assets if you are sued, but less than you'd think for a freelancing business. You decide whether it's worth the bother.

1452104,comment,1451797,1451797,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Fascinating article. It really impresses upon one the differences and commonalities between the different scripts. I never realized how much art there was involved in these other languages.<p>I'm bilingual, perfectly fluent in both English and Arabic. From my studies/experiences, I find that English alone from all others that I've come across is a purely functional language. It serves no other purpose than to <i>get the message across</i> and do so effectively. Most other languages are a form of sacred art, with a million rules deciding how the script itself is formed, what's acceptable and what's not, and tend to hang on to certain words, typefaces, accents, and dialects in written form even when the spoken language so greatly diverges from the traditional written script.<p>A primary example here is Arabic: the spoken and written languages differ quite drastically, with the spoken dialect turning into an almost different language as you move across from the Levant areas (Syria/Jordan/Palestine/Lebanon) over into Iraq and then the Gulf countries (Saudi, Kuwait, etc.) and finally into Africa at which point it doesn't even come close to resembling its spoken counterpart that we started off with.<p>Yet, with all that, the written language is 100% identical. Even though there are new <i>words</i> from region to region (not just a matter of intonation/inflection/dialect), the written language is perfectly identical and can be shared understood without difficult. In reality, these people know two different languages entirely. This is, by and large, caused by the memorization of the Quran, which is the holy scripture for Muslims which comprise the majority of the Arab world. The Quran is set in the official ""formal Arabic"" and Islam doesn't allow for the rewording or modernization of the script since Muslims believe that the actual wording (rather than the meaning) of the Quran was sent down from Allah and is sacred and not be modified (though translations of the Quran exist in almost all languages for reference/reading purposes, the religious actions such as prayers, etc. must be done with the formal arabic script, even in non-arabic-speaking parts of the world such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and even the States).<p>Back to the point at hand: In French, Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, and more there is so much attributed to the beauty of the script, the perfection of the symbols, the fluency of the spoken language, and the scientific rules holding the language together. Languages aren't <i>really</i> living in the same sense as they are in English: new words aren't <i>officially</i> added as often, and the languages themselves serve a much more interesting and less ""mundane"" task than simply getting ideas across. These languages exist in and of themselves, in a way, they're not only there to serve the speaker: the speaker actually serves the language in many ways.",1277219819

Before that I'd dieted sometimes with low fat diets but they never worked: I always ended up binging on cheese sandwiches! So for 15 yrs, I ate whatever I wanted (except for sweets) and sat on 88 kgs (BMI 32= obese).<p>Then I moved to China a few years ago, and late last year heard about the Chinese proverb: ""Eat heaps for breakfast, eat enough for lunch, and eat little for dinner"". This was news to me because all my life I thought I had to eat dinner every day. So I started following that rule, still eating the same food I always did, including heaps of eggs for breakfast. I also started keeping absolutely no food in my apartment, apart for milk for coffee, and instead ate out for every meal. In China there's always many restaurants a short walk from one's home.<p>Winter arrived, with the cold, some snow, and occasional rain, and I started skipping dinners because I was too lazy to go out, and dinners were now just snacks. After a few weeks, I noticed I weren't ever hungry in the evening. Even when I ate lunch when the restaurants opened at 11:00am, then nothing else for the rest of the day, I still weren't hungry, as long as I had a big breakfast. After a few months, I noticed I didn't have much fat where there'd been some for at least a decade, so I weighed myself: only 80kg. I've since come down to 75kg (BMI 27), but have sat at that weight for 2 months. I now weigh myself every day because (for some reason :-) I always remember to.<p>One other thing: I stopped eating white rice with my meals. The restaurants I frequent around here probably think I'm a foreign oddity who pays for two dishes instead of just one with free bowls of rice. I still eat noodles or potatoes every day though.<p>All this weight loss happened without trying very hard: eating the same fatty food I always did, virtually never eating after lunch, not exercising except for a few long walks every week, and not eating rice with my meals. Just a few simple rules. One thing I've accepted is: If I want to stay at this weight, I'll never be eating after lunch time again, and I can live with that.",1277219519

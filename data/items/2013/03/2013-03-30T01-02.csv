Even knowing how to code I find it's hard enough to find good developers, especially freelance.<p>Also, and perhaps most importantly, when I find a minor bug in my app, I can fix it myself and push an update immediately.  If I relied on freelance developers, well, crap, it's Good Friday.  So very least I'm waiting a few days.  And then maybe my developer isn't available to drop everything and work on my project on Monday (or Tuesday)... One of the primary advantages of startups is their ability to react and adapt quickly; running a technical startup alone, without a technical background, appears to give up some of that advantage.",1364608537

5464043,comment,5461259,5463504,1,0,nilkn,,,"> Isn't the answer to that question always going to be that you were offered what you were offered because that was the least amount they thought you might accept?<p>That would be an answer, albeit a very vacuous one.<p>From a game-theoretic perspective, you want the most they are willing to pay and they want the least you are willing to accept. But those two values delineate a range, sometimes a pretty big one, and what's really interesting here is where the final number falls in that range.<p>In real life, the game of negotiation does not have perfect information, which means you can fool the opposing party as to what the endpoints of that range are. That's the main way of pushing the final landing point closer to where you want it.<p>So there's a lot more to questions like this than these vacuous answers. It's a psychological game, and if their offer was actually the minimum you were willing to accept, you have to ask what else you could have done, either now or in the past, to set yourself up in a position where you could have ""tricked"" them into paying more than you were willing to accept.",1364608496

In one case, a guy with many years of seniority was fired because he stole some spam-mail coupons that a company had mailed to a non-existent address.<p>I'm not saying the USPS is a model of efficiency and I'm sure there are regional variations on strictness and oversight, but it's pretty likely that any USPS who loses (or ""loses"") a greater-than-average number of packages is risking their job.<p>I don't doubt that there are people who'd object to a package marked ""ATHIEST"" but how many USPS employees would be so offended they'd risk their jobs?<p>USPS workers often work there for decades and a lot of USPS employees have an eye towards staying there until retirement. They also get good health benefits, a nice government pension, and you don't need a higher education diploma to get hired by the USPS in the first place.

5464024,comment,5462006,5462418,2,0,dgreensp,,,"A couple thoughts:<p>* Getting demotivated by statistics is the worst possible use of time and energy.  It means nothing that the average reader of this comment has various qualities and abilities that, on average, are about average for a reader of this comment.  Every reader is an individual, not an average.  Start-ups, like people, and marriages, are so different that you just can't generalize across them in very illuminating ways.  This is the same as saying there are many subtypes, and at best you could draw comparisons or generalizations within a subtype.  Which is the same as saying if you scope your generalizations small enough and choose your points of comparison wisely, you have a chance of capturing a meaningful pattern that might actually tell you something about an individual specimen.  Or you might just be over-analyzing.<p>* It's possible to create causality and attribute events to your actions, even retroactively -- it's called taking responsibility.  You can even take responsibility for things you didn't know about, like an executive or official who resigns over misconduct below him.  There is very little we have direct control over -- the positions of our limbs, for example, but only when we are paying attention to them -- but we are expected to exercise whatever indirect control we have.  People in high positions of power and responsibility have very indirect control -- hiring the right people, putting policies and checks in place -- but they must accept this responsibility and milk it for all it's worth.  When you take responsibility for something, you choose to account for (recognize, pay attention to) the causality between you and that thing.  We exist in a vast interconnected web of causality, so it's all what you choose to focus on.<p>This isn't about disposition vs. circumstances, either.  Your disposition and circumstances are both different from other people's, as are your goals, motivations, and strategies.  It's about how much weight you should give a statistic about other people when trying to determine something about yourself.  As you learn more about yourself and the world, and especially if you pursue areas where you are strong, statistics become meaningless.",1364607757

Yes, this story shows that he did something good for someone.  Once.  And I'm sure there are other similar anecdotes.

Many of whom are bi (or queer or whatever label) and most of whom do very very much care about being on a site that doesn't just serve straight people since they're open to dating both straight and non-straight folks.<p>So if a site is inclusive, the straight dating pool should be larger too.  Even if you decide the only thing you care about is straight people.<p>> Online dating is a clusterfuck of failure for straight people (ask anyone who's tried it, or the OP.)<p>Funny enough, I can just ask myself, since I did use online dating to date plenty of straight people before coming to my senses.<p>Also, I have a fair number of straight friends, a lot of them appreciate OKC a lot and use it regularly with good results.<p>The people I hear complaining about it most often are usually people who are just angry about the fact that they can't get dates... online or offline.  It turns out there's a lot of frustrated straight people out there, but there's also just a lot of straight people out there.  Assuming that online dating works magically well for gay/lesbian folks but doesn't for straight people seems like a really large leap to make and also seems really untrue from what I've heard.  (I've known LGBT folks who haven't found online dating to be that great and I should also note that in general offline dating can be harder for LGBT folks (especially in some parts of the world) than for straight folks and online dating looks pretty good by comparison.)<p>> And this guy is an idiot for trying to cater to the straight dating market? Precisely why?<p>Well first off, I never actually said that.  What I did say was that the way the site felt it felt like it was designed with a pretty narrow frame of how dating worked and that narrow frame was likely going to be a problem in a bunch of ways.  For me, it doesn't work at all for a bunch of reasons.  For others, it'll likely be something else.<p>Look, if he was making a conscious design choice to only care about straight people, that's a thing you could do in a defensible way and you could probably design something pretty cool.  But it didn't feel like a conscious decision, it felt like a decision that was made because someone didn't think through their problem well enough to even realize the things they didn't think about.

My concerns have been allayed about the DOM, and cutting up a program into components.<p>I don't want to focus overmuch on the specifics of the Google Analytics example, but it's illustrative so I'll continue. While GA can be isolated, if you want it to track any events that involve your script code, they  need to call out to the API that GA loads onto the page. Its their intention that they can push code updates to my page (which may change how it communicates to GA servers), without me needing to redeploy my own code.<p>The analytics world is now proliferating with a number of script-loader services that serve the same purpose: update tracking (including interacting with other parts of the page), without integrating into the deploy process. There are plenty of arguments that this is a Bad Thing, but nonetheless enough people are willing to pay for this service to keep afloat multiple companies where that is their only product.<p>It's totally possible to load scripts like that in via the JS FFI, especially ones with a well-defined API. But, if both parts are separately Dart, it would be nice if they could integrate more easily than round-tripping through JS. Among other things, it would be nice to have the type information carry through.<p>So that's where I'm coming from, and the use cases I'm interested in. And if you say that those development practices are something you don't want to encourage I wouldn't entirely disagree. It does seem like something rather different than the approach your taking, and the best way to reconcile it would be for library authors to publish a header file for functions/types that Dart2JS could assume to exist.

When I was single, I made an OkCupid profile and decided to, for better or worse, be as open and honest as possible (a principle I adhere to in meat space as well).  I had over 1200 questions (this is a lot) answered and never tried to make myself seem like something I wasn't.<p>I figured I was doing everything right, and I was optimistic (a good handful of my friends had great success on OkC), but I barely got any dates, and the ones that I did ended up being duds.  I did this for maybe 8 months.<p>Contrast that to the couple of months I signed up for a paid match.com account (pro tip:  paying for a service and looking for someone else who has paid for a service shows a mutual seriousness about the service; OkC's barrier to entry is practically zero so many people don't end up taking it seriously) and here I am with a going-on-three-years-now happy relationship.  Match barely has any information to fill out and it makes me wonder if that ends up being a more successful model, as it pushes much of the ""screening"" process to meat space, where it's a lot easier to discern people's idiosyncrasies.<p>Of course, being open once you're offline is absolutely key.  I'm just not sure how well it works for the first online impression.<p>Edit:  I don't mean to attribute my relationship success to my choice of service, that was pure luck.

As someone without any experience, surrounding yourself with brilliant people is humbling for one.<p>Also I found myself learning far more than school ever taught me.<p>After a tour of duty at a big company then startups make the most sense, bringing your experience and connections into a world where you can learn to think outside your specialities and have a far larger direct impact on a company.",1364605246

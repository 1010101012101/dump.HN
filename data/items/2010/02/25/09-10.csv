1150366,comment,1143074,1149261,0,0,silencio,,,"> I know you're not saying it was fine the way it was, I just think it underscores the importance of a solution that fits in prevailing social mores.<p>Please understand that that is the problem with some of the arguments supporting what Apple did. The problems they list that are apparently now gone for adult content is still there for all the other apps. Just saying. :p<p>> What you and many others seem to avoid is explaining is why you believe that putting these applications in a ghetto would be preferable to simply not selling them at all.<p>Why? Because there are adults that don't want to see it <i>at the same time there will be adults that do</i>. By the app store rankings of some of the apps that were pulled, some of them were <i>very very</i> popular and are no doubt huge moneymakers for the developers and for Apple. I can't tell Apple that they should approve or reject content on their own store, but if there is not insignificant demand and Apple was profiting off these apps, why not? Presumably a ""ghetto""/back room will be preferable to nothing at all or doing nothing at all for all parties negatively impacted (Apple, developers) and an acceptable compromise to the complainers.<p>> That Apple is demonstrably willing to go without them would seem to undermine such arguments<p>I don't know, for a few hours yesterday the new ""Explicit"" category on iTunes Connect seemed to say that Apple's first reaction was to pull apps, then their second was to do exactly what I suggested in my posts on HN about a separate category later, either because of the backlash and concerns from pulling apps, or because they're trying to figure out how to satisfy everyone ;)<p>> If they don't want to sell porn-like apps, why should they devote resources--any resources...<p>Who says Apple doesn't want to sell them? Schiller didn't come out and say that, he said that they pulled them because of complaints. Apple doesn't want <i>complaints</i>. If Apple didn't want to sell them, they would never have approved those apps to begin with. Apple will lose money no matter what if they pull adult content, or they leave it up there and face the wrath of parents and others that won't buy devices as a result. On the other hand, a ""ghetto"" for adult apps will probably work for everyone involved. It won't be as nice as being on the rest of the store, but not much adult content on the internet in general is out in the open, as opposed to behind some kind of age verification/login wall (see: lots of porn sites, youtube), and I'd honestly be surprised if some adult content distributor was whining about naked women not being next to Plants vs. Zombies and Navigon GPS apps if the alternative is not being on the store at all. Why should Apple devote resources otherwise? Oh, I don't know, they've chosen that position themselves and are failing hard at their inconsistency, and they're already doing it with all the apps on the store now (or else face removal/rejection/inability to even submit your app). Developers also pay for it via a yearly fee. :P<p>Which is another point. If they're going to pull all sexual content from the store but allow SI and Playboy to stay on there, and they're going to keep on insisting on those 17+ ratings for apps with UGC regardless of in-app content, that makes no sense.<p>So, I think the ""why"" is because Apple is still a business. They have working parental controls and ratings that just need refined. They have an app store that needs refined too. If they can successfully pull all that off, complaints about explicit content in the top 25 list and complaints about no explicit content at all will likely minimize into oblivion. And it seems that these alternative ideas are definitely something they're considering right now.",1267091799

1150362,comment,1150313,1150313,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"To continue the metaphor, you've got two choices: write a script, or buy the rights to a script that excites you.<p>It's good that you're excited by the prospect of selling the product/project, and not by the code itself.  Projects that are driven by a love of the underlying technology rarely solve other people's problems effectively, and that's what it's all about.<p>Don't focus too much on ""the promise of welfare and respect"" or wanting to ""make a lot of money and be wealthy""-- it's easy to get too self-involved that way.  The trick is to focus outwards-- to identify a problem that some group of people are having, and find a way to solve it for them.  Relieve the suffering of others-- that's the surest way to gain welfare and respect.<p>You say you've filtered over 50 ideas.  That's a good start.  You might have to go through 500, though.  That's the way it goes, sometimes.  Fortunately for you, there's a lot of suffering out there, calling out for solutions.<p>From where I sit, it's not such a complicated puzzle at all, really.  It's a pretty straightforward puzzle.  That doesn't make it easy, of course.  But you didn't think it would be, did you?",1267091687

1150360,comment,1150006,1150006,0,0,ksraines,,,"In my view, the article is backwards.<p>Let me ask a very honest question: what does one actually have to gain, personally, from making a fundamental contribution to physics? Consider that it takes at least a decade for prizes to be distributed. So at best, you are looking at a cushy professorship at a nice University for your efforts, and maybe - if you are lucky - in your forties someone will send you a plaque and a modest check for your efforts.<p>Wouldn't any rational young man prefer something a little more tangible for a decade of his youth? Especially given the accessibility of such rewards in other fields?<p>Hence the fundamental issue addressed in the article is not actually addressed at all: the young and brilliant are simply not interested - and for good reason (IMHO).<p>Let me add one more thing. Compared to a century ago, the young physicist has much more to learn before he even has the knowledge to make fundamental contributions, hence the prospects starting out are much more daunting.",1267091467

I've noticed a disturbing trend with alcoholics where they seem to adopt more serious alcoholics into their social group as a tool to justify their own comparatively tame alcoholism. <i>I like to have a few drinks but man, Johnny... that guy is a REAL alcoholic. Let's buy him some drinks and watch him fall down!</i> Anyone who gets uncomfortable or defensive over another person quitting any addiction is a dangerous influence.

1150349,comment,1150313,1150313,0,0,dasil003,,,"I think you need to find something beyond the thought of ""success"" to drive you.  Ambition is good, but it sounds like its having a demotivational aspect in your case because you aren't finding the right ideas and your situational isn't ideal.  But reproducible success is about execution, and you can't learn to execute without practice, so whatever you do you need to get as many reps in as possible.  Your breakthrough may not come for years (or ever, frankly), but by becoming really good at what you do you will increase the chances of long-term success geometrically.  And remember, you don't need to do glamorous things to improve your skills, instead you need to learn as much as you can, figure out where your talents lie, and then (eventually) figure out how to apply this to a market.<p>Also, not wanting to work for other people may be a detriment, because you are unlikely to be able to attract the best people to your company if you are not already at the top of your field.  The experience of working with the best people will potentially teach you much more than trying to go it alone with a cast of B players.",1267090259

You can find big O costs for their operations, but they're amortised costs. Sure - once in a while you have to realloc / rehash / copy the table depending on the implementation - but then you know how to judge if that collection is ok for you.

596723,comment,596581,596581,0,0,jamwt,,,"Presenting the ""macros"" of SFO/OAK (local airports) is a great idea. Unlike commuters, airport-goers are probably more episodic in their usage of the bart system, so they're looking to purchase a ticket of a specific value for that specific trip, instead of the ""large value"" ticket they will use over many days.  They also may be less familiar with the route map and ticketing system, so more hand-holding is a good thing.  And of course, these stops are among the most popular destinations.<p>Another disproportionately popular destination is whatever stop is adjacent to the current major sporting event.  During a Warriors game, for example, you'll see the trains loaded with people wearing jerseys and team colors that all flood out at the Oakland Arena.<p>So, the addition of dynamic main-screen macros like<p>""Go to the Warriors Game""<p>.. based on some local events feed and present during the appropriate hours, would be slick...",1241644195

Still, it makes it impossible to make any real use of this information.  Did they compare statistics during the playoffs against aggregate statistics for the same teams over the entire year?  Did they only use the middle 50% (or some other arbitrary portion) of the season, to remove early-season unfamiliarity and the effects of late-season ""lame duck"" teams?  Did they only compare stats for games between teams that reached the playoffs (thus ensuring that they are at least vaguely similar caliber)?  Did they discount elimination games, where of course the teams will be less worried about being tired and aching tomorrow, because there might not <i>be</i> a game tomorrow?<p>A better way to do a study like this would be to compare non-elimination games between the same two teams, in the playoffs and out.  Unfortunately, you lose a large portion of your sample size when you eliminate variables in this way.<p>It would also be better to go the other way:  do various regressions to figure out which stats tend to change in the playoffs, and then ask actual basketball players and coaches if it's plausible that those stats could be correlated with effort.  It's not perfect, by any means, but it's better than picking some stats that we think should be correlated with effort and seeing if they change in the playofs.",1241643857

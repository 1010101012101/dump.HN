As we would say on tumblr &quot; This is why we can have nice things&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m actually experimenting with `scotty` for haskell now. Though a tad limited (getting sessions to work is a bit whiney)  I had a decently working URL-shortener up and running in an hour of composing haskell modules and writing a max of 20 lines of code.<p>This whole micro-framework thing is getting close to my view of the ideal way of programming. Use as much reusable components at any time. There is always someone who did what you were trying and probably already did it better. I prefer investing time in finding the right micro-frameworks then investing time to learn to program things in new ways (is this a bad thing?).  Anyhow, I see a lot of classmates implementing their new login systems for their little websites in pure PHP and i&#x27;m just staring at them like &#x27;what the hell&#x27;. Especially in things involving security, composable &#x27;micro-modules&#x27; are a blessing. I just combine a few libraries and whoop I got an https server that securly talks to a database that securly stores credentials and sessions. I think it&#x27;s just beautiful.<p>Okay of course I do implement things myself. that that is more out of curiosity. I&#x27;m like &#x27;hey how does this security stuff work? how do I break things?&#x27; and I read up about it and prototype a little. but I would _never_ use such code in production just because I know someone already did better.<p>So yeah. to sum it up. programming microframeworks give us this:<p>*  small,  modularized code\n*  where each module on its own is at its best\n*  where the composition of these modules is clear.\n*  and the result is highly maintainable code.<p>I would even want to take it a step further. Where certain kind of frameworks stick to the same standard. Think Promises/A+ or WAI. Now at any time in the future, I can give my whole codebase a speed boost by just changing a single line. Isn&#x27;t this great?",1387353210

6926355,comment,6922256,6926249,2,0,RyanZAG,,,"If you have 8 cores, you&#x27;ll get 8 threads and all your requests will be nicely distributed across the cores. This is why Go is up near the top for the i7 benchmarks. On the EC2 ones, there are far fewer cores, so the overhead of distributing them is much more pronounced. As you add more cores, you&#x27;d probably see Go pull further ahead of some of the competition. However if you&#x27;re only ever going to be running Go on small instances as many people do, this advantage is actually a hindrance because of the added overhead. Not that it&#x27;s necessarily a big issue or anything, it&#x27;s just interesting to consider.<p>The point I was making is that your actual hardware and workload can turn this benchmark on its head. You may naively think you are upgrading performance by switching to a different framework/language, yet if you don&#x27;t understand why each platform is getting the numbers it does you might end up rewriting your app and actually decreasing performance because of your server hardware.",1387352670

By not arresting someone defacing city hall, they trivialized a property crime.  The author intimates this was because of his race or at least his appearance.  Maybe so.<p>Next the judge exercises his discretion to come up with a non-standard sentence for the crime. Any non-instigator first offender would have gotten the slap on the wrist.  A minority, we are lead to believe, probably much worse.  Same crime but the discretion is wide in the sentence.<p>Later, the issue swings the other way.  He has some real cause to go the rally in honor of the fallen student.  Here, the discretion is taken away from the parole officer.<p>Discretion is power.  In some instances, society grants too much discretion.  In others, too little.  We know this is the case but it still shocks us and we like to second guess.",1387352486

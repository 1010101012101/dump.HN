3585368,comment,3583328,3584516,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"We've been using Flask recently, and I do like the simple, no-nonsense approach. Our project is modest in its library needs, and it's nice to have a useful toolkit without imposing a heavyweight structure on our code.<p>There are significant limitations with some of these frameworks today, though. For example, lack of byte range/partial content support is bad news if you're serving large files (think multimedia).<p>We're still investigating options here, but WSGI doesn't seem ideally suited to working that way, and as far as we can tell quite a few of the ""microframeworks"" lack any kind of support for returning partial content automatically. The concern seems to be that WSGI would need the application to generate a complete response even if it was going to serve only part of it as a 206, because there's no standardised part of the routing set-up that says ""I need these byte ranges from whatever full response you would have given me"".<p>A common philosophy seems to be that such files should be served statically by your front-end web server anyway, but that is not sufficient in all cases. For example, you might need to process the request through your framework to generate the response on demand, implement access controls, or integrate with a custom logging/analytics framework.<p>[Edits: Trying to clarify key points.]",1329137369

As the thirtieth anniversary of the Falkland Islands War approaches, I am reminded that contemporary commentary on that war pointed out that nuclear weapons had ceased to be a deterrent in the modern world, in which nuclear weapons have not been used in warfare since 1945 (in the same war as the Schweinfurt ball bearing plant air raids, against a combatant country that had directly attacked a neutral country's main military base in the ocean between both countries by surprise attack). Argentina was not deterred at all from occupying the Falklands by Britain's possession of nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles. And of course the terrorist attacks on the United States in the year 2001 were not deterred by the the United States possessing similar weapons. There seem to be a lot of kinds of warfare that can go on with no resort to nuclear weapons, and thus no deterrence by nuclear weapons.",1329137203

3585358,comment,3584609,3584609,27,0,jakobe,,,"I don't even know where to start with the author's complaints about the memory model. Inactive memory is not ""memory from a recently used app"". Inactive is just like active memory. It is not unused memory. Inactive memory is memory that has not been accessed recently and will therefore be swapped to disk first. Just like active memory, it can be be freed immediately if it has not been modified (eg. a memory mapped file, or a local copy of some shared memory), but if it has been modified, it must be paged to disk because otherwise data would be lost.<p>All the purge command and ""Repair permissions"" do is swap out lot's of memory. But this is not unused memory. This memory will likely be paged in again sooner or later. It does not help much if you simply have too little memory. That's why the author claims he has to run the commands again and again. But the problem is not the broken memory management system. The author simply has too little RAM.<p>Which leaves the question: Why does Mac OS need more RAM than Linux?<p>Well, there's the simple fact that there is much more stuff running in the background on Mac OS. You have automatic indexing of every file on your hard drive and file system monitoring. Try downloading an app that opens some file type. The moment it is unzipped, the Finder automatically uses it to open supported files.<p>Then you have an automatic version control and backup system running in the background, for every single file on your hard disk (Time Machine). Additionally, many Mac apps aggressively cache data in memory. Take iTunes. You can scroll lag-free through music libraries with tens of thousands of songs and their album artwork, and filter them instantly.<p>These things use up RAM. Lot's of it. And that's why you can't run 3 VMs on your Mac if you only have 4GB.<p>If you don't want the extra features / bloat of Mac OS please go ahead and use Linux. But don't write a completely ignorant piece about how you think the memory management model in Mac OS is broken without reading the real docs: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/AboutMemory.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Perfor...</a>",1329137196

3585327,comment,3584917,3584917,9,0,mgkimsal,,,"Nothing wrong with asking these questions, but my experience has been that most people do not know how to judge their situations to answer honestly, anyway.  I've talked to a number of people in startup-phase over the last year, and always ask variations of these questions, and when one with a hard answer comes up, I typically get something like ""you're a downer"", ""you're too negative"", ""you don't understand the market"", etc.  Or variations of ""just do XYZ!"", where XYZ, realistically, has been tried by dozens of parties before, resulting in them losing loads of money and leaving the market altogether.<p>Inevitably, we end up reading stories from people here every few months with a spin on ""startups are <i>hard</i>.  however hard you think it will be, multiply that by <i>10</i>.  etc"".  And they're right.  Whether those people have succeeded or failed, they blog about how hard everything is.  We see stories about ""I thought XYZ would take me $t and $o weeks, but it was much longer/harder/difficult than I could have imagined"".<p>One might conclude that anyone who actually had real numbers behind how much time and effort an idea would take to bring to market, no one would, and one might be right.  But just asking the questions designed to get people to think about these sorts of things generally doesn't help people too much - at least in my experience.  Might just be the people I talk to, but many of them seem to be more in love with the idea of ""startup!"" rather than actually building a business around providing value, <i>especially</i> if that business/value doesn't look/sound/feel <i>exactly</i> like the idea in their head from 6 months earlier (in ""lean startup terminology"", they're not open to ""pivot"", probably).",1329136303

Their customer support cannot comprehend this & have no idea about Bank Regulations or about policies. They are treating this as if there is a small glitch on facebook while throwing a sheep.<p>edit: removed transaction details",1329135131

The issue is that the fact OSX is Unix under the hood is merely an implementation detail and always has been. I'd much prefer it if Apple used a solid, up to date Linux distro under the hood, but they don't. To me using the Unix system in OSX feels a bit like using Cygwin on Windows.<p>Conversely with modern virtualisation software, you can have your cake and eat it. I use OSX to run desktop and media apps, at which it excels, and have Linux and Windows 7 running in VMs. Perhaps not good enough if you're doing resource intensive stuff like heavy duty compiles on your Linux system, but for my purposes it works very well. It has the added advantage that if I hack around with the VMs and something goes wrong, I can usually revert to a recent VM checkpoint.",1329134537

Just freeing the memory, in my case, would have been much quicker. Practically my machine was constantly swapping when the memory limit came up.</i><p>That's just not true.  If inactive memory is something that's already backed by disk (like a memory mapped file), it'll be discarded.  Only if it's read-write memory that's /currently held allocated by a running process/ will it be swapped out to disk.  Unless you're doing something pathological (like suddenly allocating lots of RAM and forcing paging - what purge utilities do...), the architecture /speeds things up/.<p>If it's really true that, without doing anything special, things were always being swapped out to disk for you, it necessarily means that there was a process that had allocated (lots, it sounds like) of RAM and written to it, so that stuff had to be paged out to disk to free up RAM without losing data.<p>It sounds like you were running purge commands or utilities to 'free up RAM'. That is counterproductive.  It causes the system to release cached 'clean' (i.e. as already on disk - a mapped file, essentially) mapped RAM and swap read-write memory out to disk, only then have to re-read it all when you actually need it.  In other words, using purge 'utilities' actually puts the system into the worst possible state.",1329134425

A few examples of the irrationality of crowds (NB I'm not saying they're always irrational, just that they're rarely rational/wise):<p>The expedition to Sicily by Athens in 413 BC

4626016,comment,4625067,4625067,12,0,grey-area,,,"Facebook won't be killed by another product, but by the growing data-mining and exploitation of its data (probably not even by Facebook itself). If you post often enough, Facebook (and/or twitter and g+) provides a map of all your activities, affiliations and even aspirations in great detail (often with geolocated photos, and cross-linked posts by people you have confirmed as friends), which is a treasure trove of information for companies which want to find out more about you.<p>Facebook has privacy controls to pretend that they're hiding your data, but in the words of its founder, those who trust in them are 'dumb f<i></i>ks' - they are there to encourage more sharing, not less, and are constantly undermined by the company itself.<p>That data has not been exploited properly at all yet, but when the great data-mining scandal of 2021 hits, and people are regularly being denied services (insurance,travel,benefits,jobs) because of risky activities in their youth, or confronted with just how much <i>anyone</i> can find out about the last 30 years of their life with a trivial search, there will probably be a swing back to much tighter personal control of information, treatment of all data posted to any service as already in the public record, and a general acceptance that maybe we shared too much. Perhaps our concept of privacy will shift, but I doubt it will extend to letting corporations and governments mine the highlights and interstices of our life for every salient fact, which is where we are headed if people continue to use Facebook or similar services their entire life.<p>One thing I do think might change gradually is that we'll stop believing that pseudonyms on a forum or privacy controls on a sharing website can protect your identity in any meaningful way, and start accepting that anything posted anywhere can and will be traced back to us.",1349685659

For example, if, as self-confessed pirates have frequently argued on sites like Slashdot, the advertising side-effect of sharing works freely ultimately generates more revenue for the creator than copyright-controlled distribution, then the logical move even with copyright is to put those works into the public domain and invite donations to support the creator. However, that risks the alternative possibility that the ""advertising benefit"" agument really is just another pyramid scheme, and without enough law-abiding (with copyright)/donation-giving (without copyright) people at the end of it to support everyone else, it's just rationalising freeloading.<p><i>Also, your argument does not take into account the fact that without copyright derivative works would be utilized to a much fuller extent.</i><p>There are definitely valid arguments against copyright based on greater use of derivative works. The problem is that it is also possible that derivative works would become dominant if it were easy to make them and much harder to create something original, with little incentive to do the latter.",1349685560

And if this other factor tends to trigger first, escapism into violent gameplaying, but then later (if unaddressed), actual aggression, I think they could see the ""steeper increases in adolescents' trajectory of aggressive behavior"" that's reported, even though the gameplaying is just a waypoint or signal rather than cause.<p>(Under this hypothesis, it's possible the violent gameplaying aggravates the underlying issue, if it delays or prevents other remedies, but it's also possible the gameplaying serves to soften the aggression.

This payment gateway must be easy to connect with the bank account located in Ecuador, by this I mean that there must be an easy way to transfer the money from the gateway to the bank with as little hassle as possible. Most importantly, it must be secured enough that if credit cards or debit cards dont have funds, they will get rejected and the account wont get frozen. Also, it must be able to process over 50,000 USD a week without getting frozen.<p>The business is a travel agency type of thing that markets hotels, receives the payments from the customers and then takes a cut, but they will be processing around 50k a week. They are an established business with documents to prove it in Ecuador, but they heard the horror stories of Paypal, so they are looking for a payment provider that isnt as strict as they are and that wont freeze their account since this will make them lose face and could potentially ruin their company.<p>Any advice is appreciated. If you have experience in this, it would be great to know what steps you took in getting an account, such as papers you needed to display, etc... Thank you.",1349683578

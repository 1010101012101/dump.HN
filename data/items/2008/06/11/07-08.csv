214698,comment,213902,214514,0,0,mark-t,,,"Just because two planets have been around for the same amount of time in similar conditions doesn't mean they should both exhibit life. The emergence of self-replicating molecules at any given time may be extraordinarily unlikely, such that the expected amount of time for it to happen is on the order of trillions of years. However, when you've got several planets in the same circumstances, one of them will likely succeed much sooner than the others.<p>Here's a more concrete example. Consider the odds of rolling a 528 on a 1000 sided die, and you have 5 people rolling such a die. The expected number of rolls for any individual to get a 528 is 1/1000 + 2 * 999/1000^2 + 3 * 999^2/1000^3 + ... = 1000. However, the probability that at least one person has rolled a 528 passes 50% after n rolls, where (999/1000)^(5n) = .5, or n = log(.5)/(5log(.999)) = 139.<p>In other words, you expect to have rolled a 528 after 1000 rolls on average, but you expect <i>somebody</i> to have rolled one after 139.",1213170505

As Apple pushes forward to deliver the iPhone is 72 countries, it seems to have gotten overly enthusiastic in countries like Portugal, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and Australia, each of which has gotten not one, but two carriers offering the iPhone. So much for exclusive carrier deals.</i><p>I can't speak for the others, but I haven't seen a single iPhone in Austria (in use, or in a shop; I know <i>of</i> a single person who owns one) so far, so maybe Apple isn't happy about T-Mobile's sales here.<p>Not having 3G in a country with over 60% 3G coverage (and ~99% GSM coverage) probably hasn't helped so far, so maybe the new model will change things.<p>The Austrian mobile phone market is heavily oversaturated, with more phones than inhabitants, so sales are presumably pretty hard to get. I haven't seen T-Mobile promoting the iPhone at all, although they do feature it prominently on their website. (<a href=""http://t-mobile.at/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://t-mobile.at/</a>)<p>The tariff of €39/month with a 2 year binding is very pricy, especially as text messages (SMS) are €0.25 each. (I pay €0.04 for text messages with no monthly fees) Of course, you're implicitly paying for the phone, but the whole deal just doesn't stack up well against the competition. You can get unlocked iPhones on ebay for €400-500, although I'm very wary of those - no idea if they can still be updated to the latest firmware. Also, shared data/voice plans are very expensive here, much more than getting separate data and voice SIMs, which isn't particularly useful with the iPhone.",1213169743

214667,comment,214398,214542,0,0,mlinsey,,,"That brings up an interesting idea - karma is used to rank stories and comments, and make sure more interesting content is more visible.  But the ""game"" aspect of karma (trying to make the top posters list, trying to appear a the top of threads) probably encourages some unhelpful behavior.<p>If users really shouldn't care about their karma, would the site be served better by not making karma visible at all, for users or for comments?  You could keep upvotes and downvotes, and even let users know their own karma and how their own comments are rated (so they know when their contributions are being rewarded), but their would be no high-score table of top users, and users would only be able to guess at a post or a comments karma based on where it appears on the page.<p>This would take away the motivation some people have to contribute high-quality comments - I'm not sure whether the net result would be positive or negative.<p>Part of this discussion needs to include a serious discussion of what this site's core goals are.  If this site were a web startup that needed to get high traffic, than a game-like system that gets posters addicted to writing comments to try and boost their karma makes sense.  If the site is more about making sure it has the highest quality content possible for its original niche target audience, than that would make this approach less appropriate.",1213168111

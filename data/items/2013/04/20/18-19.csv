And they would have made a good enough impression to get admitted to the school?</i><p>Shit happens. In this case it was a manhunt, but it could easily have been a highway accident, gas main break, flood or snowstorm that caused a student to miss an interview. I don't see your point.<p><i>I don't care at all about sports but I can understand a child being disappointed when he is supposed to go to a game with his father on a particular evening.</i><p>This has happened to my biz partner who promised to take his son to BoSox games and then had to cancel because of work. Kids gets over it.<p><i>I don't think you can assume that the employees at the colo would agree to show up just like that, that they wouldn't have pressure to not go (from spouses)</i><p>The same pressure could have been applied if the bomber wasn't caught, although over multiple days instead of just one.<p><i>Is the same concentrated deployment of assets being done in cities such as Camden, Newark, Detroit with high murder rates and daily crime?</i><p>As I mentioned in another post in this thread, yes you do see deployment of resources and police asking citizens to stay indoors when chasing armed suspects/gang suspects who have killed innocents. The search areas tend to be smaller and the deployment not as extreme, but then again the threats tend to be proportionally smaller (1-2 guys with handguns vs 1-2 guys with automatic weapons and <i>explosives</i>). I live in a high-crime city and have seen it happen first hand.",1366484394

5582410,comment,5581857,5581857,15,0,pseut,,,"This article kind of misses the point in a few ways<p>1. During important events, a lot of us want to be/feel connected to what's going on.  Watching on TV does that and following reddit/twitter/web does that too, but picking up the paper hours later doesn't.  You could make the same argument as the article about the super bowl: if you want to know what happened, don't use twitter or watch the game on TV (remember when everyone thought the 49ers were going to score on that last drive to win the game?  LOL FAIL!) just wait until a few hours after it's over and read about it on your favorite website!  I mean, that's all true, but it misses the point.  For a lot of events, for better or worse, we want to know what's happening as it happens.<p>2. I use twitter to follow breaking news and news related to my profession (I'm an economist), so I choose who to follow based on that and know which people are reliable and unreliable; @AntDeRosa (among others) is awesome and responsible; I stopped following some other people for irresponsibility during hurricane sandy, etc.  So there's no universal ""twitter.""  I get a lot of valuable ""breaking news"" out of twitter and reddit, but depending on how other people use it, they may not.  I really doubt that the Manjoo really believed that all of the rumors he read online were true.<p>3. Pretty much all of the relevant breaking news on, say, cyprus was coming from twitter.  There are many other examples.  For breaking non-mainstream news, there is no alternative to twitter etc.  For this event, some of the threads on r/news were amazingly informative.<p>4. From what I've read, a lot of the misinformation problems were caused by journalists either on TV or online.  Point fingers at them.<p>edit: and by ""them"" I mean those particular people, not ""journalists"" as a group.",1366483995

Everyone living in the internet age has learned to attach probabilities to everthing we read. I give CNN breaking news 60% probability of getting it right. I give @YourAnonNews 30% probability of getting it right. Although Twitter reports are often wrong, the right story is usually in there, and thoughtful people are always questioning the right facts.<p>I just want to come back to where I started. You're right that breaking news is broken. But yesterday, the chatter on Twitter alerted us of risks hours ahead of sound/verifiable reporting. Although many of those reports were quickly rescinded, I believe many Bostonians made prudent, timely choices as a result.<p>I guess my point is that news has different purposes for different audiences. For at least one audence yesterday, I thought the information coming over good accounts on Twitter was a blessing.",1366483148

5582359,comment,5582130,5582130,2,0,ysapir,,,"""The company is much more likely to work with the open-source developers""<p>This is an understatement.  When you work with an open-source third-party library/module in a commercial company, it is much easier for the company to submit bugfix patches to the open source developers.  The company probably has access to a wider range of data (including proprietary client data that can't be released) but which will highlight hard to find bugs.  The code is open source so it can debug the problem itself.  But even if it is MIT/BSD/Apache/etc, it makes more sense for the company to send back the patches to be integrated.  Otherwise, it has to maintain an unreleased patch-list and re-apply it with every version update.  If it does not apply cleanly, it has to spend resources to update the patch to the changes in the new version.  It's developer time the company can use for better things.<p>Knowing this is one more reason I am also more likely to choose code released under a permissive license than under GPL.  I figure all things being equal, it is probably better tested, better code.",1366482979
5582358,comment,5560692,5560697,1,0,EEGuy,,,"* Here [1] is a position-paper proposing an HVDC pan-European ""supergrid"" of up to 4KM distance, including undersea HVDC, overlaying and working with the existing, less capable AC grids.  No magic, no HT superconductors, just recent evolution of existing HVDC technology which will enable a ""meshed"" HVDC grid (not just isolated HVDC point-to-point links).  It elementally observes that while high cable <i>capacitance</i> limits undersea cable AC transmission distance, it doesn't for HVDC; DC doesn't get through capacitance once charged, whilst ""reactive"" (capacitive and inductive) effects limit how much power can be extracted at the other end of a ""long"" transmission link (sorry, no reference right now on that).  Avoiding reactive transmission losses is one of the reasons AC power distribution is optimal for moderate grid and distribution scale at its low frequencies of 60 Hz or 50 Hz.  HV avoids ohmic losses, while low frequency reduces reactive losses up to the limits of some estimable built-out scale.  Going to DC allows scaling out to longer distances than AC, even as ohmic losses are minimized by using HV (ohmic losses are elementally the same, whether AC or DC).<p>* Here [2] is a quick summary of recent improvements in HVDC transmission and high power ""VSC"" inverter techniques, citing [1], summarizing: ""...there is now no doubt as to the feasibility of HVDC networks ferrying renewable energy resources from wherever they are in surplus to wherever they are needed.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://mainstream-downloads.opendebate.co.uk/downloads/WG2_Roadmap_to_the_Supergrid_Technologies_2013_Final_v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mainstream-downloads.opendebate.co.uk/downloads/WG2_R...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/the-smarter-grid/hvdc-supergrid-technologies-besting-expectations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/the-smarter-grid/...</a>",1366482977

The focus of the GPL is very much on the source code itself, as though having it was everything. I think that was a reasonable assumption to make at the time, but I don't think it reflects the current reality.<p>In reality, the code itself is somewhat of a liability -- a source of bugs and a time sink when you try to make modifications. What you really want is the end product and the flexibility to modify and improve it. To have the end product you don't need the source at all, and to modify and improve it the source is (nearly) necessary but not sufficient.<p>That has a few implications. One is that companies don't want to be burdened with source code. They would prefer to share the burden with other users, as long as they aren't giving away any competitive advantage they have. Win-win: they keep the ability to improve and modify it as they need, but unload much of the maintenance cost.<p>The GPL avoids a problem where people take an open source project and try to drive it away with a closed-source product that is a little better.

A rational agent by definition operates strictly within the domain of a formal system. Thus by definition, a rational agent is in direct conflict with the notion of ""thinking outside the box.""<p>Of course any simulation is implemented in some formal system, but that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying the inherent problem with a rational agent is that they maximize utility within a formal system -- that is what they do, that is their entire purpose. Once we start talking about rational agents that can ""think outside the box"", or think beyond the formal system in which they're defined, <i>we're no longer talking about rational agents.</i><p>I agree with your belief that we may some day build AIs that think outside the box, I just don't see how it can be a rational agent. I think it will be much closer to a neural network, or probabilistic reasoning model, or some extremely ""organic"" or ""fluid"" device from which intelligent behavior organically emerges. Because if intelligence emerges from a strictly formalized framework, then Godel's theorems prove some very crippling limitations on what's possible within that fixed framework.<p>FYI there is definitely a connection between Godel's theorem and intelligence, though it may not be immediately obvious.

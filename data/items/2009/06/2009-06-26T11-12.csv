675290,comment,673737,673946,0,0,moe,,,"<i>Well, a major part of it is the almost constant flow of interruptions from people who's computers are ""broken"" (I am ""the I.T. guy"" [a title that I despise], so every problem from a phone cord with a loose connection to a user that has pressed the insert button on their keyboard and now how a ""broken email"" gets handled by me).</i><p>Many of us know the problem of constant interruptions.
Fortunately there is a workable, mechnical solution to this problem.<p>1. Get an office with a door (this may require some social engineering).<p>2. Buy a solid wooden panel (about 1mÂ² in size), two hinges, two screws and a nylon string. Make sure to buy the heaviest type of wood they have on stock.<p>3. Glue a piece of paper onto the panel with the answers to the most common questions printed on it. Think of it as your FAQ panel. There's a lot of room on a square meter, so in 8pt type you should be able to fit on there the answers to pretty much every question that ever crops up.<p>4. Mount the panel directly above the door with the two hinges at the bottom end. Make sure the panel has good travel and can swing into the ""straight down"" position. Bonus points if it can even swing <i>through</i> the opened door.<p>5. Flap the panel upwards so that it rests straight to the wall, pointing up to the ceiling.<p>6. Use the screws and the nylon string to the connect the upper part of the panel with the door knob.<p>So how does this help with the daily support workflow?<p>Whenever someone opens your door for support they will be provided <i>instantly</i> with the solution to their problem. The solution will hit them like a brick, so to say, before they even ask.<p>You still have to get up and swing the panel back into the home position after each case but that's more quickly done than discussing numlock-issues. Moreover you will soon notice a sharp decline in support requests thanks to the improved workflow.",1246016723

675288,comment,675256,675256,0,0,swombat,,,"This is probably easier to do with someone in person... I'd find another entrepreneur that you respect and trust and get a second opinion on what you can do. You may find that there's actually a whole range of things you can do (and you'll hopefully get some pretty direct, no-bullshit evaluation of whether your business makes sense). Be open with that person, so that you get equally candid advice.<p>As a piece of generic advice: I think it is never, ever, ever a good idea to get in the situation where you will go bankrupt if your business fails. Be relentlessly resourceful, but also be relentless at managing your risks to ensure you don't lose everything if things don't work out. When it all comes crashing down, you need to be still able to pick yourself up and move on to the next thing (perhaps even another start-up).",1246016547

That could be adding to the inertia - mild interest will only turn into a sale when everyone else is doing it OR there are no barriers to entry. It may be that you can offer to solve your first customer's problems by doing the leg work, development work, managing process change (what have you) for them. For instance, most businesses plan IT development work 12 to 24 months ahead - with competition for resources.<p>A pain yes - but others will follow soon enough if they see someone else getting an advantage.",1246015205

Tons of plugins, but quality and customization options vary wildly.<p>Prototype: The ""I'd like to roll my own components"" audience, very Ruby-like, super-easy to do your own specialized UI stuff. Has a learning curve, however.<p>Dojo, YUI: The ""I'm enterprisey and like to edit configuration files"" audience. Componentized frameworks, which can do everything (but make tradeoffs for complexity).<p>And of course there are others, serving various niches.<p>Your choice depends: Site or app?

I have been doing everything myself, from development, to sys-admin stuff, to sales, marketing etc. I'd characterize the feedback I've got from people in the industry so far as ""mildly positive"" - they express some interest in the idea, but are not yet willing to commit to it.<p>At the moment, I have enough cash on hand in the business to last until November, at current boot-strapped burn rates, and I have enough cash on hand personally (since the business isn't paying me a wage) until the end of September. After that, I can sell some stocks (around $10K worth) which would give me enough personal income and business income to last until around January 2010. However,  if I took that path, and the business didn't then succeed, I would be facing bankruptcy.<p>My feeling is that I have perhaps started a business which attempts to do too much for a single founder with no employees and limited capital, trying to do something in the business/enterprise space which has long lead times, big perceived risks (for my clients, not me) and in an industry which is very slow to change.<p>I don't want to give the impression that I've already decided to give up, because I haven't.<p>So that's why I'm asking HN: How should I decide whether to give up, and go back and get a job until I have another startup idea, or keep going with this one, knowing that there is perhaps only a slim chance of success (but if I do succeed, it will be well and truly worth it)?<p>Happy to provide any further information if you think it relevant.",1246014181

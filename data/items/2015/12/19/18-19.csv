I&#x27;ve been writing C extensions to accelerate parsing in dynamic languages for 10 years, and I&#x27;m very familiar with this sort of dynamism.<p>It&#x27;s interesting though that you describe this approach as more Pythonic, because one of the most outspoken critics of this approach is a hard-core Python guy that I work with who has lots of experience with the Python ecosystem.  He feels very strongly that it is more Pythonic to have very flat/concrete generated code that is transparent to the reader, and really does not like the idea of hooking import and generating everything at runtime.<p>This is exactly what I am describing about how it is hard to please everybody.  Different people appear to have fiercely different opinions about what is idiomatic.<p>When we wrote the Ruby protobuf implementation this year, we took an approach much more along the lines of what I personally prefer.  The extension is mostly implemented in C, and it&#x27;s very easy to build types at runtime.  It doesn&#x27;t directly import .proto files (which I would have preferred) because there was still some desire from others to have some kind of code generation.  So the approach we took was to use a Ruby-like DSL for describing the protobuf schema.  But really this is nothing but a translation of the .proto file into the Ruby DSL.  ie. take the .proto file:<p><pre><code>  syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;\n\n  message Test {\n    int32 foo = 1;\n    double bar = 2;\n    Test test = 3;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;generated code&quot; for this is simply:<p><pre><code>  require &#x27;google/protobuf&#x27;\n  \n  Google::Protobuf::DescriptorPool.generated_pool.build do\n    add_message &quot;Test&quot; do\n      optional :foo, :int32, 1\n      optional :bar, :double, 2\n      optional :test, :message, 3, &quot;Test&quot;\n    end\n  end\n\n  Test = Google::Protobuf::DescriptorPool.generated_pool.lookup(&quot;Test&quot;).msgclass</code></pre>",1450551383

He was doing this unwittingly and meant no true harm, but it was very insulting. This was likely another case of a youngster who didn&#x27;t have much experience working with women on a team. It was brought to the management and they spoke with this new guy and his behavior changed immediately, he&#x27;s now much easier to work with all around and everyone is happy about it. But if no one spoke to the management about the behavior, it would have gone on unchecked and probably escalated.",1450550543

Points are intended to represent engineering&#x27;s view of the relatively complexity and uncertainty of a given story.<p>Pivotal Tracker then looks at story delivery over the past 3 weeks and gives a simple average: velocity. You can then look forward to see approximately when future stories will be completed. You can also see a volatility measurement, which characterises how much velocity is fluctuating.<p>Our horizon is deliberately short, because we move very quickly.<p>Nevertheless, it has a simple advantage: it is based on the true and most recent data of the exact project you are estimating.<p>Other estimation techniques are useful in other situations, but simply being able to say &quot;those are the <i>actual numbers</i> for <i>this</i> project <i>this month</i>&quot; is enormously powerful. There&#x27;s no fudging. The numbers are right there in black and white.<p>It usually takes a little while for people new to this approach to accept that velocity is not a target; it&#x27;s a measurement only. It&#x27;s a unitless measurement that is only meaningful within a single project, operating at a floating exchange rate with calendar days.<p>One last thing that helps, as others have pointed out. Break down your estimation tasks into smaller units. Never accept the small headline that hides a big feature. Continuously look for seams to break big stories into small stories. When the pointing begins, summarise aloud with fellow engineers a rough idea of what will need to be done.<p>Psychologists call this the &quot;unpacking effect&quot;, and I suspect that it&#x27;s responsible for most of the estimation-increasing power discovered in more fully-dressed estimation techniques like PERT, parametric estimation tools or even good old fashioned checklists.<p>(I was working on an estimation tool for a while, so this subject is dear to my heart).",1450550234

10764322,comment,10763874,10764196,0,0,mikekchar,,,"This is very true.  The best way I have found to combat it is by splitting up the tasks into many smaller pieces.  If you have a task that is scheduled to take a month, then it can easily go out to 10 months in the worst case.  If you have a task that is scheduled to take a day, it can easily go out to 10 days in the worst case.  This allows you to make corrections to your schedule.<p>There are 2 other important issues.  First, you need to update your schedule based on the amount of time tasks are actually taking.  If you only have 10 tasks (each taking a month), the error bars can be quite significant.  But if you have 200 tasks (each taking a day), the mean completion time will have quite small error bars.  So if you keep a rolling average (say over the last 30 tasks), you can have a fairly good estimate for completion time (agile developers will notice that this is &quot;velocity&quot;).<p>The second very important issue is to be completely anal about your definition of &quot;done&quot; and about making sure that the completed tasks actually meet that definition.  Your mean completion time will only be useful if you are measuring the time to completion accurately (obviously).<p>This effect is so powerful that I recommend &quot;same sizing&quot; tasks and planning everything to have a completion time of somewhere between 1 and 2 days.<p>There is actually one last thing you need to do.  Requirements discovery never happens completely before you start development.  As you write the code, you discover new things to do.  It is obviously important to modify your plan to accommodate that new information.  If you don&#x27;t, you will end up building something that nobody needs.  However, the amount of new work seems to be predictable.  I made graphs of new work added to projects over a couple of years and it appears that the growth of new requirements is very similar to some of the defect discovery models (for example Littlewood).  Just making a graph of new stories/tasks added over time will give you a decent idea, but I have found that a rule of thumb of adding 30% or so (over the whole project) for new requirements seems to work well.",1450549096

10764295,comment,10757842,10762233,0,0,kragen,,,"Your main point is correct — no general-purpose writing system has ever been pictographic, not even Egyptian hieroglyphs.  But all of your supporting points are wrong.<p>Egyptian hieroglyphs were in use for about 3600 years, and as other commenters pointed out, Egypt stopped using them because they were conquered by Rome, which then imposed Christianity — which banned a different kind of &quot;icon&quot;, killing the hieroglyphs as a side effect.  Also, far from being &quot;icons&quot; in the UI sense, Egyptian hieroglyphs were primarily phonetic, although they did have ideographic components — less so than Chinese characters (which are logographic, but only about 4% of them are pictograms) but more so than the Latin alphabet.<p>The Latin alphabet, which is a modified subset of the Egyptian hieroglyphs (via the proto-Sinaitic and Phoenician abjads and the Greek, Etruscan, and Old Italic alphabets) has been in use for 2100 years, about 1500 years less than the hieroglyphs.<p>If we&#x27;re still using the Latin alphabet around AD 3400, your argument from observed adoption that alphabets work better than pictograms would make sense — if hieroglyphs were pictograms, which they mostly aren&#x27;t.<p>Every invention of writing except the khipu started out pictographic: Chinese characters (which have been in use since the Shang dynasty a bit over 3000 years ago, contrary to what you seem to think), Sumerian cuneiform, Mayan hieroglyphs, and Egyptian hieroglyphs all have clear pictographic origins.  But all of them developed phonetic components in order to expand the range of language that could be written, and those phonetic components came to dominate the script almost immediately, to the point that none of them have an identifiable pictographic-only period in archaeology.  In fact, as the numerical nature of the decoded khipus and much of the early Sumerian tablets suggests, logograms for abstract concepts such as numbers may have been in use as early as pictograms or even earlier.  So, the actual history supports your idea that systems relying entirely on pictograms have very limited applicability, even though it has nothing in common with the history you imagined supported that idea.<p>On the gripping hand, maybe computers are not the same medium as clay tablets and printed paper, and so maybe past experience is not entirely applicable.",1450548667

The TSA is invasive security theater operated on the principle that the most effective placebos are those with tangible side effects, namely body scanners and palpable tension at ultra-vulnerable (targets in and of themselves) security checkpoints.<p>2. The TSA is a country-scale jobs program for poor, unskilled, and unemployable people who might otherwise join disruptive political groups that promise more resource redistribution.<p>I think the first two points are reasonable if not explicitly provable, but my third point goes off the reservation a bit:<p>3. The TSA-friendly luggage locks are one of many overt acts of submission that the members of the public undertake in order to travel with speed; there is no incentive for the locks to actually work or be secure, as their primary purpose is to symbolize obeisance. I imagine this may be the case because the TSA-friendly luggage locks are jokes to begin with, as anyone with a common file, rudimentary lockpicking skill, or bolt cutter could pop them open in mere moments... not to mention the misbegotten troglodytes who actually have the master keys and help themselves whenever it suits them.",1450548536

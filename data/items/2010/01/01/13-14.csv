1025677,comment,1025550,1025550,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"I wonder if the TSA airport security is all just misdirection.<p>It's so clearly theater, and particularly the most recent set of regulations being so obviously ineffectual and just stupid, that it can't be serious. At the same time, there are so many better targets that remain unprotected: energy and communication transmission hubs, bridges and tunnels, malls and arenas, etc.<p>Can it be that Homeland Security is fully aware that what they're doing to air travel is stupid, but it's all designed to keep attention tuned there? Like a magician that's directing attention away from the real trick, DHS wants to keep the terrorists from thinking about the ""better"" targets. They keep all of the debate focused on air travel, so alternate ideas aren't discussed and incubated.<p>I'm start to believe that DHS has chosen air travel as cannon fodder, intentionally concentrating terrorist attention there, in order to keep everything else safe. It's kind of like the wildebeests at the watering hole. As long as the lion is eating the one weak animal (air travel) the rest of the herd (American infrastructure and industry) is safe.",1262354184

1025667,comment,1021060,1024533,0,0,elblanco,,,"In a conversation with real people, I can usually go back to somebody who disagrees with me and we can have that discussion (or they can do likewise with me). In other words, they must think about the nature of their disagreement more before openly disagreeing.<p>In addition, it's good manners. A person who is just contradictory to everything you say, and responds to all of your statements with a ""no, you are wrong"" over and over again with no further elaboration is usually considered an asshole and doesn't get invited to parties. People want to get invited to parties, so they try not to be rude in this way in real life except towards people they have utter contempt for and whose parties they don't want to go to anyway.<p>The anonymity of a virtual space however, opens up the doors to people to be out and out rude to one another. A downvote sans comment is even more anonymous because the recipient can't even see who their detractor was (and in addition, by the site guidelines can't even ask for clarification of the downvotes, which is silly).<p>However, HN guidelines also proscribe:<p>> Be civil. Don't say things you wouldn't say in a face to face conversation.<p>I think this is reasonable, my contention is that a downvote sans comment is the same as the hypothetical person who just responds ""no, you are wrong"" over and over again with no further commentary.",1262353460

1025664,comment,1025520,1025520,2,0,telemachos,,,"There are good ways to prevent getting rooted, as you say, but I know exactly what you mean. The first time I set up a virtual server, someone began a dedicated brute-force, dictionary attack against ssh within 30 minutes. The attack wasn't particularly aimed at me, of course, since I had an empty virtual machine on an ip number that I had been given only a half hour earlier. Still, it's a bizarre thing to watch the logs and see some machine hammering at your door (even if you believe the door to be very solid). The attack went on for over 12 hours, for whatever that's worth. It felt damn scary the first time - even though I knew that I had absolutely nothing of consequence in the server yet (brand-spanking new) and that I could wipe the whole setup and start fresh with nearly zero effort. Nevertheless, it was creepy. It's sort of like being in a horror movie: you simply watch and listen as the monster pounds on the door. (Of course, you have a lot more options than the twits in the movies, and your monster is usually either (1) a pimply-faced kid in suburbia or (2) a cyber-criminal who doesn't much care where he gets in and happily moves onto the next ip in short order. But the initial <i>feeling</i> was like that.)<p>Like most of the other posters, I ended up taking the following steps to cut down on the problem: (1) disable root login at all, (2) switch sshd from port 22 to another, random port for listening (that alone cut the attacks way, way down), (3) disable all password based logins; only key-based logins work now, (4) limit the users who could login remotely at all to a very small group (you can create a group just for this purpose, enroll two or three admins and edit your sshd_config file to allow only members of that group to login at all), (5) use rate-limiting in iptables to freeze out any attacking ip after two or three failed attempts in a minute.<p>A link with lots of detailed methods to handle brute force attacks and their pros and cons, in case anybody wants it: <a href=""http://la-samhna.de/library/brutessh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://la-samhna.de/library/brutessh.html</a>",1262353095
1025663,comment,1021060,1024448,0,0,elblanco,,,"> What you've just said is that because jokes are frowned upon, nobody will contribute anything useful or interesting. I don't think that follows, and the knowledge that if you post something, the reply is unlikely to be a one line attempt at humour encourages longer more thoughtful comments.<p>I don't think that's what I said at all, but If I was confusing I apologize. I'll try and say it succinctly, if people go out of their way to post something reasonably interesting or thoughtful, but possibly counter to a commonly held viewpoint, it tends to get downvoted around here. Those downvotes are a way of saying ""you are not conforming to the group mind, shape up"". A thoughtful or interesting post doesn't have to be long. Short, pithy ones are just as interesting, yet also get downvoted for not conforming to the group mind.<p>For example, on the validity of argument ad hominem: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1021182"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1021182</a><p>This was immediately downvoted, yet it's a wildly interesting contradictory thought and mildly funny as well. It's concise, witty and provokes the common perception regarding such arguments. My conjecture is two fold:<p>1) It's clear that a population of HN members simply didn't understand it and thought it was purely a joke, and annihilated it (because what people don't understand they tend to attack). Nobody who didn't get it took the time to write a three word reply ""why is that?"" - instead resorting to the downvote.<p>2) Given that this seems to happen quite a bit around here, a person who finds themselves habitually downvoted will perceive that negative community response, not as a process of a social normative function (after all, the community guidelines desire interesting comments, if a person is supplying interesting comments, they are already ""normal"") but as a process of rejection by the community and will simply stop providing input to the community.<p>This has two effects:<p>1) An interesting voice will no longer be heard, the quality of the discussion will become artificially limited by a social majority.<p>2) Since only comments that conform to the social majority's viewpoints survive, comments will only reflect the social majority - ergo an ""echo chamber"" will form.<p>> And thus HN people collectively adjust the shape of HN to taste.<p>If the taste is a bunch of people trading the same ideas around over and over again, it's not very useful other than to confirm their own preselected ideas and assumptions. We get smarter when our ideas are challenged by dissenting or contradictory voices. It helps us evaluate our viewpoint and beliefs. The reason an echo chamber is bad, is that no new viewpoints ever enter to ""stir the pot"" and force people to reevaluate things and become smarter and grow. If HN is to become an echo chamber, then it's better to not have HN at all since everybody already knows everything. The taste of an echo chamber is stale. History tends to cherish the revolutionaries far more than those that maintain the status quo. At any rate, they add flavor to the mix.<p>> No, it makes for very interesting reading and occasional actual conversation rather than banter.<p>I agree that, in the general sense, banter is not what HN is for. But I think forums are better if people can feel a little bit free to express their opinions and personalities a bit and not be constrained to an academic discussion all the time. The tempo of this site is fast enough, and the general population seems to be experienced enough, that short comments can still contain lots of meaning (like my example above).<p>> If you do that, it's not HN anymore it's a general news aggregator. It can't be at the same time about a restricted set of ideas and topics selected by the votes of the people who are here, and also open to everyone to comment anything on any topic, that's contradictory.<p>I don't think there is a lot of danger of that happening, as this meta-discussion is demonstrating, the HN community is vastly interested in the quality of the site.<p>In addition, the topics of discussion are reasonably constrained via guidelines.<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p><i>What to Submit\nOn-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.<p>Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.<p>Please don't submit comments complaining that a submission is inappropriate for the site. If you think something is spam or offtopic, flag it by going to its page and clicking on the ""flag"" link. (Not all users will see this; there is a karma threshold.) If you flag something, please don't also comment that you did.</i><p>Now, these aren't <i>rules</i> per se, but they state what the intended theme of the site should be. I don't think there is much danger of seeing Ron Paul and Kucinich posts swamping the front page any-time soon. But a post about a new law affecting business in say South Korea <i>is</i> on topic. It may not be to you if all you care about is say, discussions on Scheme, but it is to me since Korea is a technology oriented place to do business and such laws may have interesting ramifications for startups elsewhere. I'm in business, I'm in technology, and I may do technology related business in South Korea.<p>> Or, you could find somewhere else where LOLprogrammers comics are relevant, and don't penalize 'us' who don't want to participate by trying to change here so that is relevant here as well.<p>That's like saying ""don't penalize us who don't want to watch reality T.V. by putting it in the programming queue for the station I just happen to be watching! I'm powerless to change the channel or turn off the TV! It makes me to upset I'm going to write a letter to the station and demand that they remove all reality TV from their programming lineup!""<p>It's nonsensical and silly.<p>A submitted topic is like a virtual salon, if you don't like the nature of the conversation in that salon, feel free to try the next room, don't burn down the building.<p>>Given that not-everything is OK here, there will be people who don't fit in, don't like what is posted and don't like what is excluded. If that's not what you want, the choices are to find or start somewhere else where the limited subset of things more aligns with you, or to break open every niche and limited site until everywhere has everything as an allowed topic.<p>I'm reading that to mean that the lurking downvote patrol trolls here are the ones that don't fit in, yet don't seem to be able to ""move to another salon without burning the previous one down"". Again, just because you may not be interested in doing business in South Korea, doesn't mean that the people participating in that thread aren't. Feel free to move along, don't deep-six the discussion for everyone else who <i>is</i> interested.<p>> You so don't, you've argued against everything he said.<p>You apparently ran out of steam and couldn't be bothered to read the rest of the statement. Here, I'll paste it here for you again. ""I can understand the continuous meta-discussion here about how to keep HN from sliding down the reddit->digg->4chan slope. But I think we have to be aware of, and meta-discuss how to keep HN from going the opposite direction, that of becoming so rarefied that any nonconforming comments are immediately stifled and the entire board dies except for a small group who enjoy spending their time in a self-selected echo chamber.""<p>> Isn't that inherent the very nature of a group that can't discuss everything?<p>No, I think you need to lookup the meaning of the term ""echo chamber"". <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)</a><p>In short, they are something to be avoided because they limit rational thought.",1262352617

Doing more does not equal doing better.&quot; And in another section: &quot;Excellence is mundane. [It] is accomplished through the doing of actions, ordinary in themselves, performed consistently and carefully, compounded together...&quot;<p>Programming can be a solitary practice. Even if you&#x27;re working with a team and using GitHub, there&#x27;s a lot of quiet, introspective time, during which you draw on your own skills and judgement to make small decisions about code.<p>Because of this autonomy, it&#x27;s easy to revert to the programming languages, frameworks and workflow that you find most familiar. Many programmers answer to managers who are outcome-oriented; they tend to care more about the end result than the minute technical decisions made along the way.<p>But minute decisions, whether they concern optimization or design patterns or frameworks, are compounded. Taken as a whole, they can affect the look, feel and performance of a software product.<p>For this reason, I&#x27;m inspired by the swimmer&#x27;s commitment to slow, persistent improvement — approaching small decisions deliberately and thoughtfully, with the realization that they add up over time.<p>I think the take-away for programmers is that we should focus not only on the quantity of problems solved (&quot;Show HN: I made 101 apps this year!&quot;), but on approaching small decisions with a fresh, qualitative perspective (&quot;I tried switching up my workflow and experimenting with new techniques&quot;).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.lillyfellows.org/Portals/0/Chambliss-Mundanity%20of%20Excellence.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lillyfellows.org/Portals/0/Chambliss-Mundanity%20...</a>",1392825338

7264169,comment,7262819,7262819,3,0,skywhopper,,,"This is a common trend in academic journals unfortunately. Journals that accept only highly mathematical, theoretical, and statistics-filled articles have, in many disciplines, become the &quot;top&quot; journals, and universities expect their faculty to publish primarily in those journals, which creates a self-sustaining cycle of more and more abstract topics of less and less practical importance.<p>Thus, truly practical research (yes, research) appears in blogs and &quot;low-end&quot; journals, and doesn&#x27;t get credit. But which articles are actually impacting the general knowledge of humanity in a more positive manner?<p>The technical, mathematical papers have their place, but the separation of academia from the concerns of practitioners is only contributing to the growing consensus among politicians and the public that universities aren&#x27;t worth subsidizing, that what you learn there is not applicable in the real world, and that college should be transformed into something more like a trade school.",1392825113

If the mass of the cable is immensely higher than the mass of &quot;whatever it is&quot; then it simply doesn&#x27;t matter.  High efficiency (ISP) engines unfortunately stereotypically output very little thrust, while high thrust engines stereotypically waste fuel.  So rather than hoisting something heavy in only 9 minutes using incredibly inefficient engines, hoist it in a couple days and then using super efficient engines very slowly get everything back into place.  Basically you shatter the old ISP vs thrust tradeoff by immense capital expense.<p>The second problem also frankly doesn&#x27;t matter much.  Aerobraking is cheap and efficient.  I don&#x27;t remember the specs but it scales pretty well, even when small, such that one pound of re-entry vehicle can land something like 20 pounds of &quot;stuff&quot; if you do it right, so rather than building a second elevator you simply &quot;give up&quot; on 5% of the first elevators capacity.  Weight of heat shield is immensely lower than weight of fuel to get up there so don&#x27;t even bother with reusable shields.  Also once you get something up there, you should never return it with the exception (possibly?) of people.  So keep a stockpile of shipping crates of re-entry capsules up there and never take anything down.  Ever.  Except maybe emergency medi-vac.  If it costs almost nothing to get it up there, send up a solar powered foundry and a solar powered machine tool plant and start squirting out a stockpile of rough spare parts and panels and the like.<p>As for the edit, the hidden assumption is the cables &quot;have to be&quot; side by side.  However the fuel cost to travel along an orbit is basically zilch compared to getting up there.   And the materials science concerns of basically building a cablecar elevator are limited.  So if you really, really insist on installing a &quot;down&quot; elevator, simply up the &quot;up&quot; in Africa and the &quot;down&quot; over south america and if you still manage to tangle them, you must have totally screwed up beyond all recovery anyway.",1392824271

And it also fundamentally misunderstands the nature of motivation: you have no control over what motivates you. If you try to coerce your motivation into some arbitrary activity, it&#x27;s not likely to work, and if it does work, it could work a lot better, and it&#x27;s going to be very stressful in any case.<p>So, a good place to start is by trying different things until you find something that intrinsically motivates you. Once you find that thing, a lot of things will fall into place (at least, this has been my experience).

Quantum effects are (according to most current theories, at least) incalculable.<p>Case in point: Assume that the system is a single unstable atom. Regardless of how exactly you&#x27;ve measured the system (even if you&#x27;ve somehow measured it <i>exactly</i>, violating the uncertainty principle), you <i>cannot</i> simulate it - you cannot state to arbitrary accuracy if the atom will decay within, say, 10 seconds. You cannot answer the question &quot;Will the atom decay within 10 seconds&quot; to arbitrary accuracy. You can state it probabilistically, but that is not the same thing.<p>What is to say that the human brain is not the same way? I could <i>easily</i> accept that shot noise affects the human brain, and I we know that a single neuron can produce noticeable effects.<p>Or, for that matter, take climate. We know that cosmic rays affect the atmosphere, and many collisions produce unstable particles. And the climate is chaotic.

If your hosting provider uses it, sure, whatever, but ideally you shouldn&#x27;t be using it in development or working your production environment around it.<p>Code should be written portably, it should depend on the language runtime, vendored libraries and nothing else. Finicky OS/language combos should be avoided, like Ruby on Windows. If you have to use virtualization to ensure that your dev/prod environments are the same, then that&#x27;s a code smell. It should work the same on Ruby 2.1.0 on OSX in rbenv as it does on Ubuntu using the 2.1.0 BrightBox PPA install.<p>The most important thing about 12 factor, in my opinion, is the separation of code and configuration. Everything that varies between environments and deploys should be considered configuration and off-loaded to a configuration management system. The VagrantFile embeds configuration directly into your code and makes your application less portable, not more.<p>Configuration management should provide encapsulation at the level of a particular version of an operating system. You should be able to, by only changing your CM scripts, change your OS between different versions of Ubuntu, or even between Ubuntu and Red Hat. If you can&#x27;t, that&#x27;s a code smell.<p>Your hosting provider should also be abstracted over and encapsulated as well. Changing hosting providers from Linode to Amazon should not require changing your OS scripts.<p>All of this can and should be done without Big Design Up Front, it should not take you any longer to do this than to configure your app to support Docker.<p>What this buys you is real robustness. Virtualization to me is a crutch that protects lazy programmers, it&#x27;s fixing the wrong problem. If you find yourself relying on snapshots, it&#x27;s a code smell and it will come back to bite you in the ass.<p>If you think Docker is going to solve all your portability woes, you&#x27;ll be in for a shock the first time your OS stops being supported by the vendor and you have to move to a new one. If you&#x27;ve done it the way I&#x27;ve described, then you can copy your CM script for the old OS to the new OS, try a cold deploy, and fix the small number of issues that will come up.<p>If not, then you&#x27;ll be in for a long weekend.

Regarding point (1), I think that may be mostly solved by conservation of energy if the vehicle is large compared to its payload. The reason is that, as it climbs, it will have to be accelerated to orbital velocity (I&#x27;m assuming this will be done by the cable itself, or more accurately the mass at the end that keeps it in tension). It will then drop its payload, and climb back down. During the climb down, the cable will have to decelerate the climber back to surface velocity, so the energy that went into speeding it up on the climb will be mostly recovered on the way back down.<p>So it seems like the cable would sway backward as it lifts the climber, and be pushed forward almost as far when the climber descends again. If the mass at the end of the cable included some kind of constant low-grade thrust, maybe you could bank up angular momentum between runs to account for the mass of the payloads.<p>I&#x27;d love it if someone with more physics background could weigh in on it though.",1392822713

Opinion pieces don&#x27;t really belong in academia. We need sources of objective information, and academic, peer-reviewed research is quite intentionally designed to fulfill that role. On the other side, opinion pieces don&#x27;t benefit much from academia: peer review of opinions is usually just as subjective as the opinion being reviewed, and the nature of blogs and personal websites is such that they actually disemminate their ideas to a broader audience (many academic papers are behind paywalls).<p>TL;DR: Academia doesn&#x27;t need opinion pieces, and opinion pieces don&#x27;t need academia.

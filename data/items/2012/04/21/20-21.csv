I gravitated to this based on the great quote by chess master Jose Capablanca:<p>[When asked how many moves ahead he looked while playing]: ""Only one, but it's always the right one."" (from <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ra%C3%BAl_Capablanca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ra%C3%BAl_Capablanca</a>).<p>Then I read pg's essay and Bronnie Ware's blog post and realized that this post was less about work and more about life.<p>Then it hit me: My life's todo list <i>still</i> has only one item on it and always has:<p>""Always do the right thing.""<p>I realize that this can be very hand wavy because the ""right thing"" means something different to everyone and even something different to me at different times. But still, it has been the perfect #1 for my todo list.<p>Several years ago, my mother, who lived 1000 miles away, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and could no longer use the phone. So I began flying back to Pittsburgh every other weekend to be with her. After a while, even this wasn't enough. So I moved to Pittsburgh to be with her every day.<p>People tried to say the right thing to me, but it never was right. They'd say things like, ""I admire your doing this, but you really don't have to because she doesn't even know who you are,"" or ""You may be making a sacrifice now, but in time you won't regret it; you'll have nothing to be sorry for."" And I thought, ""How sad. After all these years these people still don't get it. This isn't a sacrifice from me to her. It's a gift from her to me.""<p>I'm a little uncomfortable distilling pg's and Bronnie Ware's five thoughts from down into one, but ""Always do the right thing"" just works for me. I just hope the others in my life find something that works as well for them.",1335041938

The whole point of the Judge/Jury separation is that one gets to decide matters of law and the other matters of fact.  Clearly whether or not the doctrine of copyright extends to the expression of an API is not a fact being contested here.<p>The more amusing bit is that the incriminating code snipped in Oracle's slides goes the other way: the code is in Java because Josh Bloch (the Google employee who checked it into Android) <i>wrote it in the first place and gave it to Sun</i>.  So the same TimSort implementation got carried with him into Android.  There may still be a copyright question if he actually assigned ownership to Sun, I guess.  But suing the author over the use of open source code he gave you in another open source project is... yeah.",1335041904

Competition becomes greater, risk rises exponentially.<p>This tech boom will harshly coincide with the ongoing currency crisis' around the World. It has certainly been one to watch. In my view this has the potential to be a real 1930's boom-bust cycle given how many industries are tied to the business model.<p>If you're really evil... er 'smart' you'll rake up the assets of the failures during the bust cycle at fire sale prices. That of course means having made better decision than others during said mania, which in my view is away from the tech boom altogether--ideally a diverse position in which you still supply a side of the industry. Or at the very least one in which you let others take the risks or facilitate a way out of the boom before the bust.",1335041729

An option for one of the random games to have a procedural generated map.  With a player vote at the end of the game.  Top maps added to the rotation.\n  -Burnout paradise- Use the city generator to create random games.  Again players vote at the end of the game.

A broad consumption tax is regressive pretty much by design, since poor people spend far more of their income, percentage-wise, on taxed goods than rich people do. I don't see the prebate making a significant dent in this. Yes, it will help to an <i>extent</i>, but you'll still have middle-class people paying far more taxes, as a percentage of their income, than wealthy people.<p>Cain's failure was basing so much of his plan on sales tax, which is basically impossible to make progressive.",1335041312

If they don't think the value added by my site's interactivity is worthwhile enough for them to enable their javascript, I'd much rather hear why, than present them with a snarky remark about the 'modern web'; that way I can at least try to improve the site's message so that future no-script users feel compelled to use the site as it's meant to be used.<p>I used to be a no-script user too for a time, and while I stopped using it because it became too inconvenient, I think it's everyone's prerogative to decide whether or not a site can track them or show them ads.

Diablo 3 uses procedural dungeon generation, just as 1 and 2 did, but with plenty of predesigned set pieces scattered throughout.<p>The problem still seems to be that the set of things that you can generate on the fly and all result in something fun is fairly small. The other interesting thing is that we're seeing the opposite trend in terms of the growth of user-created content as a central game component (thanks Minecraft).<p>Procedural generation will certainly be used to keep games replayable (D3's dungeon and loot generation, L4D's director AI, etc), but to claim that it will replace designers in any way is silly.",1335040388

A school cafeteria might try to nudge kids toward good diets by putting the healthiest foods at front. We think that it's time for institutions, including government, to become much more user-friendly by enlisting the science of choice to make life easier for people and by gentling nudging them in directions that will make their lives better.<p>""Most people know they should save money, but many dont save enough and may not \neven be sure what amount is enough. Most savings advice goes against human nature \nand asks people to make complex calculations. To help people save, nudge them. When \nit is time for employees to enroll in your firms retirement plan, make signing up the default. \nPeople can choose not to sign up or can quit any time, but inertia and the status quo \nconspire to keep them from doing whats good for them. Try a Save More Tomorrow \nprogram that invites participants to commit themselves in advance to a series of [savings \naccount] contribution increases as their wages rise. This approach recognizes that \npeople fear loss, and may perceive savings as a loss of disposable income, so it links \nincreases in their savings rate to parallel increases in their salaries. When people earn \nmore, the company automatically deducts more in savings. They dont have to decide to \nsave.""<p>Set up choices in a way that takes advantage of how humans make decisions. You can nudge people in beneficial directions.

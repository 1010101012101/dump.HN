      def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
          print ""I'm decorated!""
          return func(*args, **kwargs)
      return wrapper


  @decorate
  def foo():
      print ""I'm foo!""

</code></pre>
Above, @decorate is equivalent to having foo = decorate(foo) underneath the definition of foo. Decorate takes a function X as a parameter, creates a function Y that takes whatever arguments, prints a statement, and returns the value of calling Y with whatever arguments. It then returns the object representing X.<p>If you need a bunch of good examples of how first-class functions can be extremely useful, go through a bit of SICP ( <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html</a> ). It's a challenging tome, but well worth the effort.",1230713090

Probably more than 90% of the population is in extreme poverty.</i><p>This is completely false.  Haiti is indeed much much worse off than the rest of the region, but Cubans have higher purchasing-power parity than Jamaicans, Guatemalans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, and perhaps a few others, and the country is generally much more equal most Latin American countries, so the bottom couple of quintiles in Cuba do better than their counterparts in Costa Rica, Panama, etc. (or I believe than poor Mexicans, for that matter)<p>It's still overall a poor country, and has many social, economic, and political problems—attributable to many factors, including ineffective leadership, widespread corruption, the US trade embargo, etc.—but the claim that all of Cuba's problems are the fault of the turn away from markets is so oversimplified as to just be wrong.<p>> <i>Cubans was actually better off than most Europeans before Castro</i><p>This is bullshit.  In the 50s, Cubans did a bit better than Southern and Eastern Europeans, but were <i>significantly</i> behind Western Europe.<p>Most Cubans were were not very well off in the first half of the century, and incomes (and equality particularly) rose substantially between 1960 and 1989.  Then after the fall of the Soviet Union, there was a precipitous economic decline in Cuba between 1989 and about 1993 or 1994, which took 12 years to fully recover from.  Present-day Cubans have higher real incomes than they ever did in the past, however.<p>Listen, I don't really want to have a protracted he-said-she-said about the state of the Cuban economy or the precise definition of ""extreme"" poverty.  My point was merely that davidw's off-hand remarks about the topic were trivializing and unproductive.",1230712639

415304,comment,414491,415265,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"There's about three trillion worth of gold, not all of it for sale of course.  But there are enough precious metals for a lot of dollar holders to get off said currency if they feel it is not in their interest to keep it.  Alternatively, they can buy machines to dig for gold or invest in publicly traded gold companies, which also amounts to shorting the dollar.  This might not be easy or even possible for China or Saudi Arabia, but it is certainly possible for Egypt and other small countries with US treasury bonds.  If a few countries short the dollar, the price of gold in dollars would rise accordingly, making gold reserves enough to accommodate the next few stages of a run on the dollar.<p>Not enough gold? The price goes up.",1230712132

The guy who plays poker for a living in Las Vegas is just another gambler, the guy who does it in Indiana is a rock star. Same thing with internet entrepreneurs. I know all of the above first hand.<p>The big difference is that in the Bay Area, people significantly older than myself still get it. In the Midwest they're still not sure what this newfangled Facebook is all about. </sweeping generalization>",1230711682

I think the last part of your advice is the most helpful - that you need to really do wet lab benchwork, something I've tried to avoid during my undergrad, thinking that computers are the way of future and lab work is for suckers. But alas, in the realm of biology, the micropipetters and mice-killers win again.<p>But I appreciate you for also being very adamant about the ""dark side"" of academia; it would have deterred me if someone else didn't also warn me once about the ""dark side"" of going corporate (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=66390"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=66390</a>).

A free market may have ocasional dominant market leaders like IBM and MS in their time and Google today. None of them are or were monopolies as better technologies and startups will always (lets repeat that word ALWAYS) come around as long as they are allowed.<p>True monopolies like the telecoms monopolies in many countries are not outcomes of free markets, but rather more or less corrupt deals between governments and a little group of businesses. Most often the monopoly is argued as a way to protect the consumer.<p>The free market works wonderfully in many different places in the world and in many different aspects of our daily life. Banking, telecoms and health care are not examples of this as they are heavily regulated. Most of us readers of hacker news are doing what we are doing because of the wonders of the free market.<p>If not we would be marching fists held up high to Washington demanding the creation of the National Department of Internet Services, to give us lifelong employment. Yet we aren't doing that. The free market works great even though our chosen field has been hit by many different bubbles and failures. The market has picked right up with no real government interference (except for financial and gaming fields) and will continue to improve.<p>Spare me the old marxist marching chants (I should know what they sound like as I used to be one).",1230711160

If there's no profit, then there's no value added.<p>Profit works great for food, shelter, clothes, heat, and most every basic human need.<p>I think what really messes up the healthcare market is that the more that technology progresses, the more sophisticated and expensive treatments we discover.  The cost and effectiveness of treatments are both soaring, yet people whose means are not rising as fast feel entitled to the best health care no matter what.  I think as technology advances, things will only get more distorted until we realize that everyone should only get what they pay for (or what their insurance that is correctly priced by the market will cover and pay for.)",1230710549

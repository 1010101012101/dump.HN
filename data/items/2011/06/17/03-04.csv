A ""bullshit homework"" exercise is a great way to get a <i>calibrated</i> measure of an applicant's abilities and code quality. It's also a great opportunity for the applicant to show off: you can write awesome documentation, implement several variations of an algorithm to see which works best, add unit tests, etc. You can also half-ass the exercise and submit something that works but is mediocre in most ways. Of course, you would not want to spend 4 hours on a problem for each of 50 job applications, but you might pick 2-3 companies that really interest you and spend more time on those. As luck would have it, those are the ones you'll most likely get offers from once you dazzle on the code test.<p>Open source code is awesome, and I really enjoy looking at people's GitHub pages, but it's hard to learn what you need to learn from those pages. If it's a solo project, I know that the person wrote all of the code, but many times it's not and I don't want to run ""blame"" on each file. It's also unclear if the code I'm looking at is an example of the person's ""best"" work, or what how they program day-to-day, or something else. Furthermore, the code could be in Haskell or C# or Jython or whatever, which might have nothing to do with what I'm looking for.*<p>On another note, the employer runs a big risk when hiring someone. They are potentially paying salary, benefits, relocation expenses, etc. If they're wrong, they lose a lot of money, team morale goes down, and they might have to spend time cleaning up after bad work instead of implementing new stuff. Asking for a small homework assignment seems like a reasonable request when the consequences of a false positive are so dramatic.<p>Finally, a coding test likely means one of the following:\n1) the company has so many applicants that they want to set up a wall that only the really interested applicants get through.\n2) the company has high standards and wants to make sure they are not making stupid hiring mistakes.<p>I think both of these are pros rather than cons for a potential employer.<p>Just my two cents..<p>* I realize that a good developer can learn any language, but if I'm interested in technology X, and a developer knows X and Y, then it's not as interesting to me to see what they have open sourced with Y as it would be to see what they can do with X.",1308281203
2664214,comment,2664057,2664156,1,0,jameskilton,,,"I thought the article was pretty clear. It's not a browser security problem, but the fact that WebGL exposes the ability for malicious code to attack bugs and issues with graphics drivers (of which there are many).<p>For those that don't know, WebGL follows the OpenGL ES 2.0 spec, which doesn't have a fixed function pipeline. This means that you're doing two things: defining vertex information in buffers that get sent to the graphics card, and then writing shader programs to define how those vertices are rendered. IIRC It's the shader programs and how the drivers work with sending these programs to the cards that are the biggest issue (you are writing code that gets compiled and runs <i>directly on the hardware</i>).<p>Given that the Windows 8 preview made such a huge mention of HTML5 / JS / CSS for making desktop apps, I don't think competition w/ DirectX is a part of the issue here.<p>Add to the article that there are already a significant number of research attacks using WebGL to take full control of a computer, I have to say that MS isn't crazy and in this case has a pretty good hold on things.",1308281176

I've filed a ""reconsideration request"" with Google, and only got a boilerplate response saying our site has ""no manual penalties"". Unfortunately, any spam report, reconsideration request, or communication via the Webmaster Tools interface seemingly goes to a black hole. I wouldn't even know who to contact or how to contact them.<p>I can understand why they can't reveal too much about their algorithm, but at the same time if they want to build a ""healthier web ecosystem"" I think they have to do a better job of communicating with legitimate webmasters (this is going to be the subject of a future post). There is so much uncertainty out there that I think even legitimate site owners are afraid to speak out for fear of being punished, when instead they should be working together with Google to help improve things. It's like the attitude is: if you're doing well, don't say anything or you might draw Google's scrutiny (especially because you're probably doing something shady), and if you are doing badly don't say anything either because Google will just punish you more (because they have not told you why you have been punished in the first place). So instead people are driven to anonymous postings on random forums where wild misinformation spreads.<p>The intent of this post wasn't to focus on why our particular site wasn't ranking well anymore in Google, but to try to see if there were other website owners out there who feel comfortable coming out with their stories, and to share anything they may have learned. Again, there is so little real information coming from Google that most people I know have just been grasping at straws, so it would be great to hear other people's stories.

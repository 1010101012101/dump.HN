3200742,comment,3199907,3200305,4,0,davidhansen,,,"My understanding of Amazon's internal SOA usage is that it is geared toward timeout-enforced service response guarantees to mitigate concerns about performance penalty.  Specifically, a page render event triggers initiation of asynchronous calls to N service endpoints( I have read as many as 300 per page render event ).  The page renderer will wait for a specified time to receive responses from each service, but timeout on those services that do not meet their latency SLA.  Page components with dependencies on either error result or timed-out service responses will simply be not rendered or replaced with dummy content.<p>Employees of Amazon, feel free to correct any holes or errors in my understanding of the web application architecture there.",1320523089

The drop-out sends a countersignal that would need to be balanced with a strong body of work outside of school.<p>Look, I think no matter what your degree was in, we're at a point where some amount self-directed study is expected of all job seekers. Most of my peers in CS at Michigan studied languages outside of the curriculum and regularly built side projects. That's expected with or without a degree.<p>An English degree at most top schools is no cakewalk.

The second is this concept of ""winning"".<p>If you combine these two ideas, you come to the conclusion that if any other language is seen to be ""winning"", it should be simple to port that language's syntax and stdlib onto a lisp environment - after all, every facility the other language might need can be provided by the lisp runtime, and reader macros might be a suitable way to avoid an explicit compilation step, depending on the language being tackled.<p>I cannot think of a single case of this happening.  Instead, we see precisely the reverse - clojure is implemented on the JVM, CLR and JS runtimes, and there are scheme implementations <i>everywhere</i>.<p>What does this mean?  It means that it isn't languages which ""win"" or ""lose"".  It's plaforms.  ""Lisp"" isn't a platform, therefore it cannot ""win"".  The question is moot.",1320522510

I could've become a journalist/blog writer, novelist, advertising copywriter, movie or TV show writer, academic, etc. I had an aptitude and interest in technology that pushed me to technical writing. After 5 years writing professionally, I was making 80k; last year (my 11th in technical writing) I'm into 6 figures (and in the Southeast US, to boot) including bonuses. Not bad for an English major. And, not at all rare.[1]<p>I knew from the beginning that you can't pick just any major unless you wanted a deep, abiding knowledge of that concentration and/or had a natural inclination or aptitude for it.

3200698,comment,3200213,3200213,2,0,Mz,,,"Discussion of this sort comes up quite often on homeschooling lists (or did, back in the day).  The short version is that this is the difference between ""training"" and ""education"".  ""Training"" is what America generally wants to provide to, say, people on welfare so we can tell them ""get off the dole and get a job"" (while simultaneously making it outright illegal to aspire to a better life/follow your dreams -- last I heard, you can attend a two year degree program while on welfare but not a four year degree program).  ""Education"" is broader preparation for life, not just preparation for a job per se.  Lots of American universities are increasingly offering degrees that are essentially intended as ""job training"" of some sort.<p>Slice of life:  I happen to have an Associate of Arts in Humanities and a Certificate in GIS.  The certificate in GIS was gotten as ""job training"" and I am still paying on the student loan that was needed.  I have never worked in GIS and the job I do have started at about half the pay as the GIS-related jobs I was interviewing for.  On the upside, attending GIS school helped me get boatloads of life-saving drugs from doctors who wouldn't prescribe me anything while I was mostly bedridden.  So I consider that student loan kind of a ""medical bill""/cost of survival, never mind my (relatively mild) bitterness at how utterly my well-laid career plans* fell through.<p><shrug><p>* FWIW: those career plans included a future Master's in Urban Planning.  There are relatively few bachelor's programs in urban planning. For this reason, most planners have some other major at the bachelor's level.  Liberal Arts majors (at the bachelor level) are not terribly uncommon in that profession, from what I gather.",1320522058

3200608,comment,3200193,3200193,11,0,overgard,,,"Talking about things as broad and vague as ""community"" tends to obscure things more than it helps, in my opinion.<p>A more useful exercise is to consider the factors that go into people choosing a language in the first place. I don't think people usually think hard about how powerful or elegant the language is, at least when they're starting out, rather they pick it up when they need to solve a specific problem. For example, here's how I ended up using the languages I've learned in the past:<p>QBASIC - Because I wanted to make video games when I was a kid, and things like functions and classes and scopes confused 10 year old me. The idea of executing a sequence of commands was simple enough to grasp.<p>C - Because that's what all the ""real"" programmers used, and I had reached the limits of what I could do with basic.<p>VB - Because writing a GUI in C sucks.<p>Perl - Because that's just what you used for web pages at the time.<p>Java - Because of college.<p>C# - Because VB was pretty lame.<p>Python - Because I needed something better to write small programs in, and the entirety of perl would regularly fall out of my head because it's too complex.<p>F# - Because C#'s verbosity gets on my nerves and everyone was all up on functional programming; but I found the library support in most other functional languages lacking.<p>Ruby - Because it's kind of the lingua franca of web startups at the moment.<p>And on and on. I'd say about half the languages up there are actually pretty awful, and none of them are as good as LISP, but they did something specifically useful for me at the time I learned them. I can't really say that about LISP, because LISP doesn't really have a niche. The reason I ended up learning LISP (Clojure specifically) was because I wanted to be a better programmer, but I don't think that's really a strong enough argument for it if people want it to ""win""",1320519903

That realization is what lead to monitors.txt. I'm working on something like this along with a rails plugin for checking jobs run on time:<p><pre><code>  Feature: Jobs should run on time

    Scenario: Search Subscription Job ran on time
      Given the job started and ended at:
        | start                   | end                     |

        | 2011-10-29 05:30:01 GMT | 2011-10-29 05:37:42 GMT |
      Then I should see the job took less than 10 minutes
      And I should see the job started every day at ""05:30 GMT""
</code></pre>
The rails plugin generates the text above and start/end run times with something like this:<p><pre><code>  class SearchSubscriptionJob

    def perform
      # Fire off the search subscription emails
      ...

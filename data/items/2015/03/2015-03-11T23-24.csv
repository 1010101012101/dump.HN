Racket tends to de-emphasize more complicated function composition, which tends to serve it just fine. I&#x27;ve always adopted a somewhat pro-functional approach in my usage of the language, but even here there wouldn&#x27;t really be a distinctly better way to do it.<p>I guess I was just hoping that Haskell, being a more composition-oriented language in many ways, would have some nice built-in to do that for me.",1426118388

Coal plants still have to burn even if there is a glut of electricity because of favourable solar conditions.<p>And as such, coal plants should be deprecated for combined cycle natural gas plants that can be throttled more granularly for demand (and can also meet air regulations coal plants cannot without great expense).<p>> Solar boosters like the article author love to prove how baseline producers have to accept negative rates means that they are somehow wrong in the market, but having baseline producers run at loss or worse, close down permanently is not something that any of us want - especially in the middle of a harsh winter.<p>Negative rates are a signal, and effect all base load (coal,  nuclear, hydro, etc) equally.

In Racket, writing a macro for this would be trivial, but alas, this is Haskell. Perhaps there is a way, I’m just not aware of it.<p>A reasonably clean way would be to define<p><pre><code>  data Color = Red | Green | Blue | Yellow | Orange | Purple
    deriving (Enum, Bounded, Show)
</code></pre>
and then (e.g. in ghci) you can do<p><pre><code>  >> [minBound .. maxBound] :: [Color]
  [Red,Green,Blue,Yellow,Orange,Purple]

I often define the useful function<p><pre><code>  enumerate :: (Enum a, Bounded a) => [a]

We&#x27;re really, <i>really</i> good at competing.<p>Fortunately, private property rights give an incentive for people to protect & foster animals they would otherwise have an incentive to kill.  No sane person would want to live within range of a lion—unless he derived some benefit from it.

As for your last two sentences, there&#x27;s quite a large middle ground between strict demonstrative reasoning and purely emotional argument.

And goods also give rise to a similar fluctuation because they bring harm to many people; for before now men have been undone by reason of their wealth, and others by reason of their courage. We must be content, then, in speaking of such subjects and with such premisses to indicate the truth roughly and in outline, and in speaking about things which are only for the most part true and with premisses of the same kind to reach conclusions that are no better. In the same spirit, therefore, should each type of statement be received; for it is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits; it is evidently equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician scientific proofs.&quot;",1426117526

You should be doing more listening than talking during these outings.<p>* Research what&#x27;s happening outside your bubble. 
It&#x27;s easy for myopia to set in when you&#x27;re working so intensively. It&#x27;s good to be current and forward-thinking, and inspired by outside industries/sectors.<p>* Be healthy.
Echo-ing other sentiment expressed before me - being physically strong helps you be mentally strong. It only takes 30minutes a day to clear your head.<p>* Talk to other CEOs.
Whether it&#x27;s YPO, old college friends, new entrepreneurs, whatever - no one understands the trials and tribulations of being a CEO other than someone who has lived it. I spent so much time focusing on what I could do for my company, I didn&#x27;t think &#x27;networking&#x27; was worthwhile. But I learned later that surviving the struggle is easier when you realize you&#x27;re not alone.",1426116676

It needed training wheels to get people up to speed. Thus, to name one small example, why iOS buttons have tended to look so very button-y. To inform the user, as clearly as possible, that this is a button that can be tapped.<p>Look around you. Any street corner. Any office. Any shopping mall. Any restaurant. You will see people tapping on touchscreens. We all get it now. iOS-style computing is no longer novel; it is now the standard interaction model for personal computing.<p>The primary problem Apple faced with the iPhone in 2007 was building familiarity with a new way of using computers. That problem has now been solved. It is time to solve new problems.&quot;",1426116450

So they tried out playing actual &#x27;evil&#x27; characters. I can&#x27;t remember all the examples he gave, but one of their plots was the kidnapping and raping of a princess. He said that campaign didn&#x27;t last very long and his group found it pretty disturbing.

It&#x27;s fantastic, especially after the years I spent in government, where we were all treated like children who required policies on every damned thing to guide us.<p>An obvious example is about how you use your computer. In my old job, it was highly regulated. Want to install Firefox on your machine? Sorry, that&#x27;s against IT policy, we only support IE. Your machine is locked down to prevent unauthorised installs, and even if it weren&#x27;t, you&#x27;d be up for a warning for violating the policy.<p>In my current company, the sysops still limit what they support - for example, they&#x27;re not willing to support OS X Yosemite users yet, and recommend users stay on Mavericks. But, if you want to upgrade to Yosemite, you can, just don&#x27;t ask the sysops for help fixing it. And if your broken Yosemite install is impeding your work, well, we trust that you&#x27;ll resolve it one way or another.<p>Or another - alcohol. In the government, alcohol at work was banned. A beer at lunch could get you fired. When we had Christmas parties, alcohol was provided, but on a token-per-drink basis. Everyone got two tokens. My current company, the beer fridge is a treasured perk. There are no rules about how much beer you can drink, or when you can drink it.

I was actually hoping for some more tips, but it seems to just be a rehash of the information in part 1.  Maybe I&#x27;m missing something.<p>Since I already live this way, here are a few things that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned anywhere else:<p>1) Wear a hat all day.  It makes a huge difference.  A sleeping cap is essential on cold winter nights, but even during the day some kind of hat will really help.  I wear a wool cap that makes me look like an old man.  My wife seems to be happy with long hair, but still wears a night cap at night.<p>2) Your feet and hands are the first thing to get cold.  I work at home as a programmer, so I&#x27;m not often moving around.  My wife bought me a kind of pillow with a pocket in it to put my feet.  It is amazing.  Any kind of pillow with a blanket over it will work just as well, I think.<p>3) On the same topic, never, ever go anywhere without wearing slippers.  As soon as your feet get cold, it is really hard to get them warm again.<p>4) If you are like me and have a sedentary job, make sure to go for walks at regular intervals.  As it never gets below freezing where I live, I also go for a bike ride at lunch.  Your muscles are amazingly efficient heaters -- and you will lose weight!  (I am always worried about being cold on my bike, but even at 3 or 4 degrees C and the wind howling, the bike is the warmest place to be).<p>5) Don&#x27;t get wet.  At cold temperatures it takes forever to get dry again.  All the while you will suffer.  If you must get wet (washing dishes, hands, face, whatever), then make sure to use warm water and be careful not to get your clothes wet.  If your clothes get wet (i.e., if you go for a walk in the rain and your socks get wet), change to dry ones immediately.  I really can&#x27;t stress this point enough.<p>Finally, if you <i>do</i> end up getting cold (your skin feels like ice, or your fingers or toes go numb), then warm up immediately -- however you have to do it.  If you start shivering, then you have gone waaay too far and you must warm up.  Learning to live comfortably in the cold takes a lot of practice -- it is not intuitive (at least it hasn&#x27;t been for me!).  Do <i>not</i> &quot;tough it out&quot;.  If you get cold, then realize that you have made a mistake somewhere and try to figure out how to fix it for next time.",1426115360

9188073,comment,9180795,9183839,0,0,pseudoplatypus,,,"> Yeah, tech went mainstream and blockbuster movies are made out of cult classic books. That&#x27;s one of the points in the post, those things used to be signals of particular kind of person but are no longer.<p>They were more than signals, they were the culture that reflected the values we identified with: the wonder of discovery, the beauty of places that didn&#x27;t exist, the value of smarts and imagination. Those values are nerd values and are also mainstream values. It is a point of agreement for which we can all start to talk. I think most nerds I know define nerdom by what they like and the acceptance of obsessive liking of an idea, not by any other &quot;kind of person&quot;.<p>> I see the author&#x27;s point in the way people with more social power than myself ask for my conformity, to their benefit and my cost. It&#x27;s framed so politely, everything is these days, but sometimes I don&#x27;t want to adopt another persons standards.<p>That&#x27;s usually fair. But what happens when what people are pointing out is that your standards are unjust and are harming them? It is one thing for people asking you to, say, dress in a suit and a tie (an arbitrary imposed standard that really couldn&#x27;t matter less unless you want to impress the people who like suits). It is another when the standard they are asking you to adopt is &quot;don&#x27;t grope us, don&#x27;t assault us, don&#x27;t insult us, don&#x27;t provide cover or plausible deniability to those who willfully grope us or assault us or insult us.&quot;. Taken to the hyperbolic extreme, if someone imposes on me from the outside the standard that I should not kill people (assuming it weren&#x27;t already within my own personal standards), it is still an imposition, but one they are within their rights to make.<p>Social justice advocates really are as transparent as the name: they advocate for (social) justice. If your standards are unconventional but just, go ahead: you can be into D&D and feminist, you can be a furry and feminist, you can be an otaku and feminist[1], you can be into BSDM and feminist, you can be as weird as you wish to be and still treat people well even if awkwardly. You don&#x27;t even need to be an advocate for gender equality, just do a good faith attempt at not perpetrating or upholding injustice. But if your standards are unjust or they facilitate injustice, why wouldn&#x27;t people be allowed to point that out to you and request that you change them?<p>Keep in mind that often, nerd feminists are not insiders encroaching into the outsider&#x27;s safe space, but outsiders within a larger group of outsiders, trying to avoid being harmed by manipulative people skilled in the culture of the larger outsider group. They are often those of us, that we are allowing to be bullied, by others &quot;like us&quot;.<p>And, do people do unjust oppressive things in the name of justice and anti-oppression? Sure. Mob-mentality online shamming campaigns often are such injustice, at least when focused on individuals who are not powerful public figures (be it DongleGate or GamerGate, and I think there is still one of those that is far far worse). We should mention and call this out as well, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the points about there being injustice in nerd culture (as in pretty much any culture) are invalid.<p>[1] Do I even need to mention you can be a brony and feminist? ;)",1426115264

Reductionist dismissal of new work based on partial understanding of the marginally related is a tell-tale sign of the middlebrow. It is epidemic in communities like this. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything more vital to intellectual maturity than learning to recognize those dismissive reflexes in oneself and inhibit them. That is the essence of an open mind.<p>There&#x27;s an analogy to startup investing here. The habit of dismissing the easily dismissable—the obviously lame, the obviously bad idea—guarantees failure even though it&#x27;s almost always right. This is what the masters of the art keep trying to tell us.<p>I marked this subthread as off-topic because it&#x27;s off topic; it doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t agree.<p>The post has been hammered by both the flamewar detector and a ton of user flags. We turned the former off, but not the latter. Doing more would probably make things worse.",1426115002

You ignore high costs of multiple engines, both intrinsic and inter-engine -- including, notably, a memory cycle collector of some sort, with its attendant write barrier costs. See Fil Pizlo on webkit-dev the other year:<p><a href=""https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/018811.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/...</a><p>As for your lamenting the lack of Machiavellian market power abuse by Google, it really is not clear that even Google can force Dart down others&#x27; throats, or its own throat. Rewriting JS code in Dart is a net lose, as far as I can tell. No Google property yet uses Dart, even with dart2js (I welcome correction).<p>Ignoring the morality of such market-power shenanigans (hey, I was at Netscape, but I&#x27;ve paid my dues, and someone had to be &quot;first&quot; :-P), it is also not clear &quot;Mozilla would then have no choice&quot;. Money AKA energy is not free; Mozilla can least afford follies; there is always an option to reject a neo-standard.<p>Microsoft could not make VBScript stick in the &#x27;90s. I say this is signal, yet again. Multiple and mandatory HTML scripting languages exact high direct and indirect costs. Lack of such an outcome is not a conspiracy or tragedy. It&#x27;s economics and evolution in action.<p>Update: WSH, shebangs, wow. You forgot about security!",1426114837

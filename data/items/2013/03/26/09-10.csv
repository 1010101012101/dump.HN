5442162,comment,5441757,5441757,13,0,acqq,,,"Two most interesting news for me are:<p>> The garbage collector is also more precise, which costs a small amount of CPU time but can reduce the size of the heap significantly, especially on 32-bit architectures.<p>Previously, 32-bit version was almost unusable is some cases when garbage collector kept the allocations for which \nhe falsely believed to be used even if they were not. I'd like to know if this means that the problem is finally solved.<p>> Previous Go implementations made int and uint 32 bits on all systems. Both the gc and gccgo implementations now make int and uint 64 bits on 64-bit platforms such as AMD64/x86-64.<p>This is a C-like can of worms, forcing you to test on more platforms just to be sure that you have portable code. I believed there's no reason to do such things with primitive data types in the new languages of 21st century (compare with <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/dat...</a>).

5442161,comment,5428871,5434549,1,0,just2n,,,"But there's a circular logic flaw in believing the two aren't related. Producers (not just laborers, think scientists, researchers, editors, engineers, managers, etc, in that they produce services and products) have some cost/value that you might term ""capital"" (really everything is technically capital in that sense), and investors having more money due to less taxation results in them being able to pay for more producers.<p>But it doesn't really work that way. Producers are typically the majority of the consumers as well, and that's money that ends up back in companies as capital that ultimately is more valuable than investor capital, since it's renewable and with a profit margin doesn't gain equity and increase in value like investor capital. But in a sense, then consumers are investors, just a different type, but they're being taxed more highly, so they can't afford to consume as much, so they invest less capital in companies.<p>There's a cost of living, too, that you can't ignore. If producers contribute more of their earnings to taxes and have less to live on, then the margins are smaller and they necessarily need to seek higher income to offset the taxation -- which results in their production capital becoming more expensive, which makes investor capital less potent as well.<p>I don't see a good argument at all for taxing people who work for their money, because all of those argument circularly apply to the working people as well, and logic would dictate that it impacts the value of capital and ultimately leads to fewer jobs. Lower producer taxation and higher taxation on investor gains may reduce the available capital (but not necessarily the amount invested) but it also reduces the cost of other forms of capital, while increasing the amount available for investment from producers. That means a much larger class of people have more room to live well and spend, versus a few living well and spending. To put it really simply: higher income taxes and lower investment return taxes results in financial segregation while the opposite tends to destroy it. It's clear, given that basic fact, why some argue for or against it. It also changes the types of investments companies need to seek, which may or may not be a bad thing.",1364291877

The reason this worked was because of the wealth of Oracle knowledge out there, access to experienced DBAs with knowledge of good methods, etc.  I found MongoDB to be a bit young in this sense, performance tips were down to 'change your schema' which is also true for Oracle but there are many ways to make Oracle work better with a legacy bad schema.

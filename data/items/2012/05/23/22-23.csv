4015771,comment,4014400,4015386,13,0,gfodor,,,"rangeCheck's implementation is a baby step above ""Hello World"". Oracle's lawyer stood up in front of a judge and jury and tried to claim that that function and Joshua Bloch's admission that he copied it was evidence of Google's guilt. Basically, he tried to take advantage of their lack of domain knowledge to fool them into thinking this was a real Thing Worth Deliberating. Turns out his ploy failed since the judge knew wtf he was talking about and actually codes.<p>A (flawed) analogy would be if it were a case around the copyright infringement of a book whereby the author, at a new company, copied the phrase ""Table of Contents"" from a previous novel and pasted it into his new book's table of contents at the head of the page. Anyone with half a brain that understands the domain of writing realizes this is elementary and outside of the scope of what constitutes real, novel IP. Arguing such a point reveals you want to exploit the ignorance of your audience to not know that ""Table of Contents"" is a phrase used in the industry and obvious to come up with on your own to describe that part of the book. Basically, once the jig is up and the audience knows you're full of it, every claim you make downstream from there (""I know it would take me months to be able to write rangeCheck"") makes you look even worse.<p>The reason this is memorable to me is it makes it as transparent as one could hope as to who in the room was arguing based upon reality, and who was arguing to win. For a software company to do this is an embarrassment since we are supposed to be increasing computer literacy not exploit computer illiteracy to our own advantage.",1337813963

4015757,comment,4013807,4015544,1,0,iamgilesbowkett,,,"hey man, re:<p>""If you look at Rails itself (it's great Ruby code, I highly recommend really reading it)""<p>I've worked with a member of Rails core, and frequent committers. I've spoken at 10 Ruby conferences at least, maybe 20. I'm familiar with the Rails code base. I once rewrote a few small pieces of ActiveRecord from memory for a stupid project because my wifi was dead.<p>I agree about it being worth reading, I just want to slow you down there for a second. Otherwise we're going to end up pulling things out and measuring them. I took the time to check your links, although I'd seen most of them already. I'm familiar with concerns and although I think your links are germane I'd have to disagree with this part:<p>""Deciding what things would fit well into external modules and what modules to create is a new skill to be learned""<p>As I think I've learned the skill.<p>What I'm saying basically is that I think you missed the mark in terms of guessing my background but I believe it was an honest mistake.<p>Egos aside, I agree that modularity matters. And I must admit I had a painful reminder about that skill recently when I built something around ActiveRecord and then refactored ARec out of the picture for performance reasons (the gains were staggering). It would have been less painful with better modularity, but I don't think the pain relief from using concerns would have been particularly great in this instance. Non-zero, but insignificant.<p>I don't care that much about OOP theory, but the pragmatic issues Objectify addresses seem to come up for people all the time. A year ago Steve Klabnik and a few other people were talking about this and I noticed it then how it was echoing James Golick's (the OP) posts about limiting ActiveRecord's role from a few years before that.<p>There basically seem to me to be three trends in discussion of scaling Rails: 1) ""Rails can't scale"" FUD, 2) DHH saying ""just add hardware and/or caching"", and 3) this idea of decoupling persistence from modeling, basically, reining in ActiveRecord, which I've heard from people like James Golick, Steve Klabnik, Gary Bernhardt, and I think Xavier Shay. Paul Dix wrote a great book about making Rails apps service-oriented, the Thoughtbot guys touch on it in their antipatterns book as well, and it's not exactly a coincidence that for many Rails apps the only gem more crucial than ActiveRecord is Delayed Job or Resque.",1337813562

I've long been a fan of BSD jails because of how simple the security model is to understand, and how secure they've been in practice. Jail has long been a killer feature for BSD and very, very good reason to use a BSD-derivative for web servers, etc. as you can run each and every service that has the potential to be compromised in its own jail to minimize the overall risk; whereas the best Linux had to offer has traditionally been a chroot'd environment, which while good, has absolutely nothing on a BSD jail.<p>I'd imagine that LXC has the potential to change that, though I presume it'll take some time for a) adoption to increase and b) for it to prove itself after that.",1337813303

Consider the scenario that energy is created from the destruction of matter (vs oxidizing it) and we switch the entire planet to that energy source, we eliminate all green house gases associated with energy production and a big chunk of those associated with transport (all cars/trucks/trains become electric, no more coal or fossile fueled power plants, we burn hydrogen/oxygen in planes perhaps. So on the climate change front at least we can revert the human contribution of CO2 back to prehistoric levels.<p>Ok so then there is the question of actively regulating the temperature of the ocean (which we might want to do for other reasons like food production). One might speculate on using the planet mantle as a ginormous heat sink. It has a fairly large heat carrying capacity over all.<p>See when you're writing science fiction you don't run into this bump:<p><i>""And on this note, there's practically no magic in fusion power. They can't drastically undercut ""primitive"" fission reactors, because much their infrastruture would be identical (heat exchangers, steam generators, power generation, the power grid...) Add up the costs of modern power, and fusion also carries most of them. It's like a ""factor-of-two"" miracle in the most optimistic fantasy -- not an order-of-magnitude, not earth-shattering magic. (Less optimistically, I don't see how anything like tokamaks or laser ICF machines can be anything but more complicated and costly than conventional power, and I haven't see any physically-sound alternatives.)""</i><p>You are extrapolating on existing fusion principles and getting stuck. Gene Roddenberry invented ""warp engines"" which provided the energy in limitless quantities, and then went on to think about ""Ok given some reason why X is true, now what?"" kind of stories.<p>My take on Stross' essay is that we don't really do enough of that. And that is in part because our technology is 'close enough' these days that writers fall into the pit that you just stepped in, reality, aka 'non-fiction.' (I really liked the cyberpunk examples in this regard) So getting one's thought process out ahead of that can be quite challenging. (Easier if your fiction it more fantasy oriented, since you make a hard break with reality)",1337812917

4015695,comment,4014141,4014985,26,0,taliesinb,,,"There are many respects in which Mathematica is an exceedingly well designed language. It falls down in some areas. Perhaps the Part syntax [[..]] is a bit clunky, but I think for the most part the syntax is actually pretty great.<p>Here's a rough list of things that I think make it stand out, written for someone who might not be familiar at all with it.<p>0) Functional style<p>A common style of functional programming involves building up quite complex data structures in an add hoc way using lists, symbols, rules, and so on, and then successively transforming these structures. Mathematica excels at this, having more 'neat' high-level functions to work with such ad hoc data structures than I've seen in any other language.<p>Of course you've got the usual Map and Fold and Nest, but then you've get FoldList, NestList, MapThread, MapIndexed, Scan, Cases, DeleteCases, Count, Select, Position, Replace, ReplacePart, ReplaceAll, SortBy, and on it goes (see <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/FunctionalProgramming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/FunctionalPro...</a>). Many X also have a ParellelX that takes advantage of multiple cores.<p>Also, many of them use the expressive pattern matching 'sub-language' that Mathematica has. The pattern language was originally designed for writing rules that perform symbolic integration and differentiation, it turns out that the kind of flexibility you need for that is great for general purpose use. You use them all the time to get at parts of your complex expression to process them, count them, remove them, etc.<p>Lastly, almost all these functions have support for a 'depth spec' that enables you to say at what level or levels inside your expression you want to operate. Also useful for operating on rich data structures.<p>1) Uniform syntax<p>Like other LISPS, there is a nice and uniform s-expression syntax 'underneath' the more elaborate syntax. For example, to check the length of a list and conditionally append something, we have, If[Length[x] > 3, t++]], whose FullForm is actually If[Greater[Length[x], 3], Increment[t]].<p>Of course, you can use more familiar syntax, but sometimes when you're not sure of the precedence of something it can help to drop down to the explicit form.<p>Another nice thing about the syntax is that it makes everything serializable. Trivially. ToString[..., InputForm] produces a string version of <i>anything</i>, a function, a graph, a distribution, whatever. ToExpression gets it back. And you can define your own forms too, to join the other built-ins, of which there are many useful ones, like AccountingForm, ScientificForm, TeXForm, TableForm, etc..<p>2) Symbolic expressions<p>At a basic level everything is built out of lists, just like LISPs do. Well, lists with an interesting <i>twist</i>: the lists are 'colored', so to speak -- every list has a head, a symbol hiding behind the list, even if it is empty. So Foo[] is the empty list with the symbolic head Foo. A list like {1,2,3,4} is just a list with the symbolic head List.<p>All symbols (heads) are inert, and are defined just by mentioning them. But you can attach rules to the symbols that say how they should evaluate -- that is in fact how one defines functions.<p>In fact, the ordinary control flow constructs are exactly this: special heads that evaluate their arguments in certain unusual ways. So If will prevent its other arguments from evaluating until it knows whether its first argument evaluates to True (another symbol).<p>Now, this can be somewhat inefficient for tight loops, but luckily you can compile such things down (although you loose some of the fancier features, like pattern matching). Also, there is a lot of hidden optimization -- large lists of integers are transparently packed into arrays, as are matrices, and use special libraries for multiplication etc, even though you're using the same Times symbol at the top level.<p>Anyway, it's a very unique model.<p>2) Homoiconicity<p>Code is just data that hasn't evaluated yet. For example, I could count all the global variables mentioned by the definition of a given function:<p>Count[DownValues[func], s_Symbol /; StringMatchQ[Context[s], ""Global`* ""], Infinity]<p>I regularly use Mathematica in this sort of way to analyze the code I'm writing find bugs and understand how something executes. It's quite neat.<p>You can also use the basic symbolic pattern matching ingredients to do quite weird and interesting things, like defining your own language constructs if you needs something extra -- think LISP macros on steroids.<p>In fact, it is quite possible to <i>define</i> object orientation by using the symbolic pattern matching functionality such that it looks and feels like it was built into the language. Typically, though, you end up thinking in a very different way and only occasionally find yourself needing OO-like code.<p>3) Batteries included<p>Mathematica has got a ton of stuff built-in.<p>* It has a really quite killer image-processing library, for example (it bundles OpenCV to handle a lot of the more sophisticated stuff).<p>* It has great support for graphs -- which are first-class objects, not matrices that are to be <i>interpreted</i> as graphs. By support I mean almost all of the textbook graph algorithms, for example.<p>* It's got hierarchical clustering, common statistical tests, linear and logistic regression, etc<p>* It's got almost all of the commonly used statistics distributions, a lot of computation, and a limited degree of inference on them.<p>* It's got all the pure math you can eat, and plenty of numeric math.<p>* It's got more visualization and plotting than you'll know what to do with.<p>* It's got nonlinear optimizers and constraint satisfiers.<p>* It's got quite an unusual debugging system, that allows you to watch for certain patterns in your code as it executes (although no-one ends up using it because it is a bit alien).<p>* It's got a pretty robust layout engine (originally for typesetting math).<p>* It has a more-than-adequate set of graphics primitives built in, both 2D and 3D. Of course you use the same s-expression syntax to build your scene graph (well, tree), which makes it extremely easy to use (Graphics[Circle[]] displays a circle in your notebook, for example). The renderer is of really high quality.<p>* It's got what amounts to a GUI toolkit, so you can very quickly build an interactive UI with sliders and buttons and interactive graphics, again thanks to the symbolic nature of the language. Anything too ambitious will cause the frontend to unpredictably crash, so don't try to write a word processor.<p>4) Notebook interface.<p>You really do not know what you're missing until you've used it. Notebook interfaces are the future. I know iPython has an experimental one that my academic friends love.<p>Trust me, a REPL is a poor excuse for a notebook interface. The rest of the world will catch up, though, its an idea that is too good to hide.<p>5) Help system<p>I suppose it's up there with Visual Studio type of products. But it does have the nice feature that the documentation is actually all executable. It's quite nice to look up some function and then start mucking around with one of the examples live until it does what you want to do, and then you copy paste it into your notebook.<p>6) Good names<p>All the functions have rational, good names, with a uniform syntax. You can often predict a function that <i>should</i> exist, type the first few letters, press Cmd-K to autocomplete, and be pleasantly surprised that it <i>does</i> exist.<p>You won't find 3 different versions of a function, you'll find one version with sane defaults and optional named parameters that can customize that behavior.<p>--------<p>The only real downsides I can think of is that it doesn't have a first-class dictionary type, which can be annoying. Part of the reason it doesn't is that it wouldn't be LISPy, and there also weren't performant pure data structures (until Clojure came along). There is a fairly easy way to fake dictionaries using downvalues on anonymous symbols, but it doesn't feel idiomatic. A little bird tells me that proper dicts are coming in version 9 (using Bagwell's tries for performance).<p>Oh, and that it costs a chunk of change. I forget about that because I get it for free, because I work at Wolfram. Though in the R&D department at Wolfram|Alpha, not in the advertising department at Mathematica :).",1337812732

How does that change things? Imagine that you can install giant chillers in the ocean and regulate its temperature regardless of surface air temperature.""</i><p>This is the wrong question. Energy isn't limited any more than any other industrial product; the cheaper it is to manufacturer physical things, the cheaper it is to harness energy (and the cheaper it becomes). And conversely, in most uses of energy, you have a lot more ""work"" to do assembling whatever it is that uses the energy, than whatever harnesses it. It's really a problem of industry itself; and the more efficient that gets (in a fully-automated, AI-controlled industry -- many orders of magnitude), the more available it becomes. To get abundant energy you need industrial wealth (and vice versa); energy isn't an isolated problem and isn't the important one.<p>And on this note, there's practically no magic in fusion power. They can't drastically undercut ""primitive"" fission reactors, because much their infrastruture would be identical (heat exchangers, steam generators, power generation, the power <i>grid</i>...) Add up the costs of modern power, and fusion also carries most of them. It's like a ""factor-of-two"" miracle in the most optimistic fantasy -- not an order-of-magnitude, not earth-shattering magic. (Less optimistically, I don't see how anything like tokamaks or laser ICF machines can be anything but <i>more</i> complicated and costly than conventional power, and I haven't see any physically-sound alternatives.)<p>Sure, the fuel is ""cheap and abundant"" (if you fantasize D+D fusion becoming technically viable -- it's not so if you try the far-easier D+T using lithium-bred tritium) -- but that's exactly the wrong solution, because again, the costs are all elsewhere, on the physically-building-things part of the equation.<p>Heat rejection can be very serious. The current world looks like ~10^13 watts direct, anthropogenic heating (basically ""energy use""), compared to a radiative forcing of ~10^15 W of anthropogenic global warming (closest figure of merit I believe) and ~10^17 W total terrestrial irradiation. (N.B. the greenhouse effect is a pretty huge ""amplifier"" of anthropogenic heating -- burning a ton of coal yields a certain amount of heat directly, but some 5 orders of magnitude more heat indirectly through AGW (if you integrate over the 10^3-10^4 year atmospheric residence time... don't quote me on this, I'm unsure)). Greenhouse heating is solvable, but at a couple orders of magnitude higher power consumption (say 10^15 W -- 100x present, think 10^10 people at 100 kW(th)), anthropogenic heating becomes a comparable climate issue. Approaching 10^17 W (think 10^10 @ 10 MW, if it goes there) you need geoengineering -- blocking parts of the sun (cliche), or increasing the emissivity of large swaths of the surface.<p>Beyond 10^17 watts you can't keep the earth anything like its natural state: even you completely block out the sun, you more than make up for it with the heat you generate on earth. The only way to dissipate heat from the earth <i>ultimately</i> is into space (forget ocean chillers at this point!), and the only way to do that is the way it's being done now -- radiatively. (Modulo material properties, emissivity/abosprtivity) the power you can dissipate per area goes as he 4th power of temperature (T^4) in absolute units (rel. absolute zero). So there's exactly two options: one, to drastically increase the surface area, which will look like ""moving into space"" -- creating a habitable world far larger in aggregate surface area than the earth (though not in mass). The other is fairly dystopian, to heat up the earth's surface beyond the habitable point -- e.g. moving into refrigerated underground cities (this <i>is</i> thermodynamically sound). With this insanity you could dissipate 10^22 W with a solid-carbon surface around 4000 Kelvin -- about 50,000x the current solar budget or 10 million times the current anthropogenic budget. Maybe you could still run computers at this temperature.<p>Anyway, 10^8 watts per capita => 10^18+ watts is no longer an ""earth"" solution -- you either push it off-earth, or alter the earth beyond recongition to solve heat dissipation.<p>(I'm actually not imaginative enough to figure out how to spend 10^8 watts. That's the order of the (average) power of launching a space shuttle once per day -- and you could probably fit a hundred people in something on that size, 1 MW per person. Even rocket-powered spaceplanes at Mach 20 aren't that costly...)",1337811876

Programming is hard... let's go shopping:<p>Starting at the top-right, and comparing to other professional web development languages, we have:<p>RUBY. Well, yes, you need to know a programming language in order to program. Ruby does some things well (closures!) and some things poorly (monkey patching!). Overall, it's no harder or easier than most OO programming languages. Price relative to Not-Rails: 0. Let's move on.<p>RUBY / GEM MANAGEMENT. Ruby is crap at versioning and isolation. So is nearly everyone else. (Ever heard of DLL Hell?) And at least gem downloads, installs, and handles dependencies for you. Overall, it's a bit better than average, but not great. Price: 0.<p>RAILS FRAMEWORK. You know, I've programmed a fair amount of Ruby, but I've never used Rails. Most of the stuff listed inside that section seems fairly typical to me. But let's take the article at its word and assume it's kind of hard. Price: 100.<p>GIT. You gotta use version control if you wanna be a real programmer someday. Git's a brain-bender, but you don't have to use it. Next! (Price: 0.)<p>TESTING. From what I've heard, Rails doesn't have the greatest support for good TDD. There's a lot of integration testing needed, which is slow, which necessitates asynchronous integration, which leads to automated build servers, which lead to people ignoring broken builds, which lead to bugs, which lead to pain, which leads to suffering, which leads to... <gasps for breath>... er, sorry, you pushed one of my buttons. Let's just say that testing could be better, although, in fairness, the other frameworks are probably worse. Still, in Rails you're actually expected to test. Good on them. Price: 1,000.<p>AGILE PROCESS. Hey, it's my favorite poorly-defined marketing term. But let's say you're using a rigorous approach to Agile... say, practicing Agile the way <i>I</i> think you should [1]. That does take some work. Incremental design, in particular, takes real practice. I don't think it's actually harder than any other rigorous software development approach, though. I mean, seriously, compare ""face to face communication"" with ""requirements phase gate documentation and sign-offs."" Yikes. Price: 0.<p>IDE/TEXT EDITOR. Really? REALLY? Any pain here is of your own making, Mr. vimacs. Price: 0.<p>COMMAND LINE. There was a day in which every real programmer knew how to use the command-line. I've been dismayed to discover professional programmers who can't, and instead use Visual Studio or Eclipse for everything. Shocking, I say. Kudos to Rails folk for bringing it back. Price: 200.<p>DEPLOYMENT. Meh. Someone's gotta do it. Doesn't always have to be you. I doubt Rails changes this. Price: 0.<p>SQL: Object-relational impedence is gORMless. (See what I did there?) Price: 0.<p>OPERATING SYSTEM: Umm. Really reaching on this one, aren't ya. Price: 0.<p>WWW: That shit be hard, man. Really fucking hard. I don't know half of it half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of it half as well as it deserves. Half of it doesn't even work half the time. And... that's not really a Rails thing, is it? Price: 0.<p>Final bill: 1,300: a bit harder than other web programming, but only because the Rails folks actually do testing, despite Rails not being great at it.<p>I'll let you decide what the exchange rate is.<p>PS: Yes, I know this rant is barely related to the point of the linked article, not nearly as funny as I wish it was, and really a giant waste of time on my part.

There are lots of ways to tackle this problem, but it really depends what precisely you have inside those models and there are certainly no universal silver bullets. Lots of people who complain about this underuse Rails features, external plugins etc. I think two good ways to deal with the problem are:<p>- Splitting out logical pieces of behaviour into separate modules, especially the ones less central to the core responsibilities of the class. If you look at Rails itself (it's great Ruby code, I highly recommend really reading it), this is the way it is structured, ActiveRecord::Base provides tons of functionality as a single class, yet it still is very neatly laid out into many well-separated modules.

For example you can extract complicated algorithms into separate classes or use value objects:<p><a href=""http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Aggregations/ClassMethods.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Aggregations...</a>",1337810415

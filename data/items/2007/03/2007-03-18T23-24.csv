My answer is always a big NO and I try everything to persuade small startups that have not spent any money yet on the idea, not to pursue it. If you have an idea for mobile handset market, read about ""walled gardens"" (google for more links): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_(media)"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_(media)</a><p>Unless you have some extremely strong connections (i.e. you have an ex telco exec on the board or as a CEO), stay clear of ALL closed platforms. (Incidentally, and that also includes Windows/MSOffice/Exchange etc).Startups need to be agile and startups have a higher chance of becoming successful if there are less barriers that you need to jump over, not more. This is why Internet is a perfect platform for startups... there are virtually no barriers (unless net-neutrality is defeated)!

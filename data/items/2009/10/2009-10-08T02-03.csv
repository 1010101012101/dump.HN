It's called ""False Economy: A Surprising Economic History of the Word"" by Alan Beattie. If I remember correctly, he focuses on how Argentinian land was owned by wealthy elites, satisfied with their wealth. In the US, small parcels of land were handed out to poorer individuals. Thus, the US held a greater attraction for immigrants. In the US immigrants also migrated inland quickly, leaving room in the cities for more immigrants to arrive.<p>Some of the book is available online through google books.",1254968882
868119,comment,866345,866636,0,0,luke_s,,,"""The Java language does not offer any way to explicitly allocate an object on the stack, but this fact doesn't prevent JVMs from still using stack allocation where appropriate. JVMs can use a technique called escape analysis, by which they can tell that certain objects remain confined to a single thread for their entire lifetime, and that lifetime is bounded by the lifetime of a given stack frame. Such objects can be safely allocated on the stack instead of the heap. Even better, for small objects, the JVM can optimize away the allocation entirely and simply hoist the object's fields into registers.""<p>Taken from an IBM developerworks article here:

Japan, Korea, Taiwan, etc) are export-oriented and encouraged trade, they were all quite protectionist early on. Big companies like Toyota, LG, Hyundai, Samsung were all heavily subsidised by their governments in the early years, and were aided by other protectionist measures (such as local content requirements, import tariffs, etc). In these cases, protectionism served a purpose - which is to protect local industry until it is globally competitive (ie. infant industry protection).<p>Notwithstanding, these protectionist policies don't always work out (eg. see Indonesia's airplane industry). Furthermore, Korea and Japan have had (and still have) an extremely difficult time reversing protectionist policies due to the lobby groups that represent the vested interests of the now successful companies.",1254968782

Allergies are the result of a hypersensitive immune system. The allergic immune system misidentifies an otherwise innocuous substance as harmful, and then attacks the substance with a ferocity far greater than required. The problems this attack can cause range from mildly inconvenient and uncomfortable to the total failure of the organism the immune system is supposed to be protecting.</i><p>So hookworms give the immune system something else to fight rather than allergens.<p>For that matter contracting AIDS would probably also limit or stop your allergies.

I want to say it's about $12k +/- 2k per year per employee. We're getting grandfathered in because our investor currently has a startup using their services. It's my understanding AdminiStaff doesn't support companies under 10 employees.<p>At the previous startup I was involved with as a normal employee, we used AdminiStaff and I thought it was pretty nice. It saves a ton of headache/time, and they keep you in check with all the employment laws, etc. I thought the health/dental coverage was really good too; I picked United but you get a few options to select from. I've been told AdminiStaff can get great coverage for a lot cheaper because of their size, but I'm sure you'll pay a premium overall vs. doing all the HR work yourself.<p>One thing I did like is after the startup failed, I was able to access all of my employment records for the IRS without having to jump through the invisible hoop of locating our former office manager (who we fired many months before the company closed).<p>So thumbs up from my experience thus far, I'm sure you can google around and find complaints though.

If you use a thermoelectric generator, you then have wearing mechanical low efficiency systems on board.<p>In both cases you need to reject heat, which is hard in space.<p>They also require precise pointing.<p>There&#x27;s also the problem of beaming the power to earth. If you&#x27;re in low orbit, there would have to be lots of receiving stations and the power would be intermittent unless you had a big constellation. And all the problems with inclination and the spinning earth... If you&#x27;re in geostationary orbit, your sending and receiving antennas would need to grow huge.<p>What about beaming between satellites? You&#x27;d need a laser for that. Maybe they&#x27;re becoming quite small and efficient with modern semiconductor technology developed for military uses. Still the receiving end might have low efficiency.",1377773830

The programmer&#x27;s performance is also measured by their ability to achieve the goals within the defined deadlines and accepting a task just because it&#x27;s interesting even if it means a big delay is not very common.

Total revenue in the market is the amount consumers spend on groceries. Thats more or less constant. Wall Mart&#x27;s low revenue/employee ($211k vs $620k) means they employ more people for every dollar of market share they have. This is an <i>enormous</i> difference. It implies that every time Costco win $1m in market share from Wal Mart, total employment drops by 3.1 people.<p>Aldi (and its slightly upmarket cousin, Liddel) serve a similar market segment to Wal Mart in Europe. Is suspect they do it with even higher revenue per employee. These store are all about labour efficiency.<p>This might be a &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; scenario for retail workers and people concerned with wages at the lower rungs. Employers might be able to afford higher wages, but demand for those wages will go down. In that case, its hard to imagine wages really improving in the long term. Even if they did, total employment would be much lower and that would hit the lowest skill workers hardest. When you pay better wages, you can be choosier.<p>This may be taking it a little far but.. I think what we see running through this scenario is an example of how improved efficiency breeds wage inequality.",1377771382

They are THE HOTTEST series of smartphones that young Chinese people and recently their parents are trying to get. Since 2011, it has brought several competitive phones to market, usually priced 300 dollars, selling millions within minutes online. And the quad-core 4.7 inch RED-MI which was partnered with Tencent  sells for about 150 dollars, which is winning over the lower end market in China. It has this beautifully polished MIUI OS, which is much better than the original Android, and most other distributions(there are places better than iOS). At the same price, most Chinese made phones, incl. Lenovo, Huawei, Coolpad, have mediocre hardware and software. Xiaomi is often sold at 10% the price online at Taobao, since you need tremendous luck to buy one online (The first batch of Red-MI was sold in 90 seconds, 7 million users were waiting for it, only 10 thousand got one). So to say, Xiaomi is a company creates pretty good smartphones at a fraction of the of ip5 and S4 that mostly everyone in China wants, while mostly everyone outside China has never heard of it. I guess Hugo Barra would be a boon for the internationalization of Xiaomi smartphones.",1377771379

When compared to stationary panels (which beat trackers economically, so they should be the baseline), space-based power harvests  (yes, pi) times as much sunlight due to lack of cosine loss, plus there&#x27;s the bonus of reduced reflective loss. Atmospheric and weather loss is avoided entirely. I would estimate 4-5x the energy.<p>The big advantage of space-based solar imo is the ability to create giant collection areas defined by minutely pressurized helium structures. A giant parabolic mirror on Earth needs to fight gravity, winds, and the Earth&#x27;s rotation (tracking).

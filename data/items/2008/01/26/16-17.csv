I've long predicted this won't work; one group of potential customers doesn't really want to change, the other group is unwilling to give up control.  It's not exaggerating to say that human nature is on the line here, and that if I am wrong this is probably the most important idea you will ever encounter.""<p>From (which has additional interesting comments):\n<a href=""http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/12/buy-self-constr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/12...</a>",1201366678

No one told him the oldest cliche in the book, that money doesn't buy happiness? Is it a mystery that so-and-so would be happier making 40K and owning a business than another person doing inventory at WalMart for 50K?",1201365909

We have seen a surprising amount of traffic from StumbleUpon. I'd recommend you hit that up (along with JohnN's excellent suggestions). Join it, get some friends on it, and get yourself stumbled up.",1201365819

Perhaps I took it too far but I can't help but notice during the last year or so that I've been monitoring this thing and posting once in a while that there is definately a strong undercurrent of ""look at this stupid guy and his stupid idea"" here among more than a few people.<p>Or when a ""non-hacker"" is looking for someone to help out or a hacker who doesn't know a particular technical aspect looks for help, the lashing is severe.  There's a difference between constructive criticism, designed to challenge but inspire the recipient, and just being a jerk who gets off trying to look the bigshot by making others feel like losers for sharing private aspects of their personal entrepreneurial struggles.<p>We all have more in common than differences; for example we're all surrounded by cubicle drones in this life who secretly rejoice at the prospect of us failing miserably because they're too scared to try going out on their own to do their things ... shouldn't we generally be supporting each other and keeping our morales up as much as possible?<p>If you don't like someone's idea and genuinely think it should be improved, say so.  But what good does it do anyone to tell them, ""wow your idea sucks ... it's the stupidest idea of all stupid ideas ever!""",1201365631

Here's an example from 3 weeks ago where google failed to provide answers that a centralized error lookup site might. Google had little that was relevant for the first several weeks this problem was out and only showed results for an ancient cause of a similar error message.  Eventually it picked up a blog post, but 3 weeks is a long time.<p><a href=""http://blog.ra66i.org/archives/informatics/2007/12/23/a-quick-gem-101-faq-gemrunner-name-error/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ra66i.org/archives/informatics/2007/12/23/a-quic...</a><p>Quote from the person who ""fixed"" the google bug with a popular blog post:<p>There's a ""problem"" with the current version of rubygems that's causing somewhat of a FAQ, that as far as I can see, Google doesn't index too well...",1201365389

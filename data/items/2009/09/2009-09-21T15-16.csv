834848,comment,834717,834717,0,0,alex_c,,,"This post seems to make two separate arguments:<p>1) A driven individual won't be content to idle if they get a big exit, they will likely jump right back in.  If you think what you want is an eternal vacation, you're probably wrong.<p>2) Therefore, a driven individual shouldn't pursue a big exit, if they already enjoy what they're doing, because they'll just jump back in.<p>I agree with 1), but not with 2).  I enjoy what I'm doing, but the list of things I want to do is growing at a faster pace than my ability to work on them.  I'm just not built for the ""one true lifelong obsession"" model.<p>Edit: the more I think about it, the more I realize why this post bothers me.<p>I'm really starting to think that 37s and HN are preaching to completely different choirs - which is strange, given how well 37s posts do here.<p>Some people thrive on routine and order.  They love to get up in the morning and know what they'll do that day.  To have a successful system figured out, and to follow it.  And yes, there are always new challenges, and yes, the system is continuously improved - but to some extent, it's routine.<p>Others thrive on tackling the unknown.  That initial rush of carving out an answer, starting with a blank slate.  The uncertainty of not knowing what you're doing, the high chance of failure, but also the joy of not being constrained by what came before you.<p>In programming terms, it's the difference between maintaining code and starting a new project.  Some people obviously enjoy one more than the other.<p>Seems to me like 37signals is preaching code maintenance over starting new projects.  Sure, in many cases that makes a lot of sense, but which one's more FUN?",1253548728

Some statistics that might been good ammunition (each gathered with rates of several different cohorts: white, black-non-immigrant, black-immigrant, non-black-immigrant)<p><pre><code>  * # of hours spent on homework
  * # of hours parents spent with children on school-related activities
  * Rate of parental participation in school activities
  * Absenteeism rates
  * rates of student failure to complete homework
  * rates of student participation in school-related activities
  * all of the above plotted across grade levels (do any of these statistics vary over time as children become more susceptible to cultural forces from peers?)</code></pre>",1253548689
834845,comment,834717,834717,0,0,natrius,,,"This makes no sense. I don't understand why the 37signals folks seem to willfully ignore that the amount of money that a successful acquisition gives a founder means you can do whatever you want for the rest of your life, <i>including solving interesting problems</i>. You can even solve interesting problems that aren't profitable to solve. Unless the company is almost guaranteed to be valuable enough for the foreseeable future that a sale (or other exit) will make you financially independent (e.g. Facebook), there comes a point where it is clearly better to sell the company.<p>Since the Mint acquisition seems to have inspired this series of posts, let's take a look at it. Mint is successful because banks have crappy online products. Banks are perfectly positioned to end Mint's customer growth, and there are several other competitors in the industry as well. There is not a particularly high chance that Mint will still be successful in 5-10 years. If it is successful, the marginal utility of the increased worth for the founders declines pretty rapidly. Selling now seems like it was clearly the best idea, and disproving that is going to take more than the false dichotomy this post presents.",1253548667

While the likes of thesixtyone and Amie Street help a band sell their music digitally, we believe that their ultimate success is rooted in engaging fans in a physical manner.  For example, we have created an automatic gig booking system of sorts.  The band simply picks a date, time, and a desired venue, then a request is sent off to the appropriate people.  This venue will then have all the information they need about the band, and can accept their request instantly.<p>We also believe that those little plastic discs that the RIAA peddles aren't dead in the water.  In a recent study, 90% of 18-25 year olds said that they would like to purchase a CD even if they can download the same music online.  Its simply a matter of creating value for those customers through creativity (ie. buy a cd, get a jam session with the band).  We have arranged the capability to offer on-demand pro CD creation--the band doesn't have to invest a dime in that production.<p>These are just a couple of directions that we are going in right now, thanks for your feedback!",1253547147

I don't know if the original proponent is claiming this, as I find the post can be read either way.<p>Basic evolutionary theory would point out that even if sleep <i>started</i> out as a totally optional thing that could be skipped with no loss, that evolution would rapidly start using the sleep period as a hook to load in other things that provided an adaptive advantage. For instance, as long as you're going to be sitting there doing little-to-nothing in a controlled, predictable manner, why <i>not</i> load all your muscle repair into that time period, leaving your wakefulness period with muscles <i>not</i> concerned about repair? Why <i>not</i> load various cognitive batch processes into the sleep period, as long as it is there, leaving you with a brain that isn't worried about those things during the wakefulness period and therefore spending more energy on useful computation, or even just plain spending less?<p>I've actually directly observed this process in my evolutionary computation homework assignments. I choose that phrasing to indicate my not-extensive experience on the topic, and that even so, I've seen this, where chunks of useful code get loaded up with other stuff that bears some sort of relationship to the original. (And evolution has a strange idea of ""relationship"".) (I do sometimes think that evolutionary computation should be a required course for biologist PhDs; the hands-on experience is invaluable.)<p>I often wonder at ""either/or"" arguments in the context of evolution; to me it betrays a profound misunderstanding about the process. It is the very incarnation of a ""both/and"" process. Is sleep an optional resting period just to conserve energy, or a time for healing, recovery, and cognitive batch processes?

From the consumer standpoint it's not irredeemably flawed; $-per-word is better (gets at the same point more accurately) but that'd take actual work to calculate so it's not going to show up in one of these essays.<p>That said it has some weaknesses, mainly variations on the ""Fallacy of Division"".<p>The major dubiousness as a consumer metric is it runs the risk of double-counting ""quality"" when applied to the nonfiction written word: you can have a better article either by better writing or by being longer + more comprehensive. Within the constraints of magazine writing you'll see a narrow band of variation in ""writing style"", leaving ""length/comprehensiveness"" as the major source of one article's ""better quality content"" when compared to some other article. Thus the risk of double-counting: if a 10000-word article A on Edo-period Japan is better than a 2500 word article B on Edo-period Japan <i>mainly</i> b/c of how much more nuanced and detailed it is, you double count when you:<p>- praise A for the higher quality of its contents (thoroughness/nuance/etc.) when compared to be B<p>- praise A for also giving you <i>more</i> to read than there is in B<p>...which won't <i>ruin</i> the metric but is an easy way to overstate a case. SHORT VERSION: ""local"" content quality (at the word or page level) is heavily dependent on the overall quality of the larger item it's a part of (the article); when you say ""this awesome 10 kiloword article has 10000 awesome words in it"" you double-count the awesomeness.<p>This isn't enough to sink PG's thesis but it is a danger to be aware of when naively applying the metric.<p>What sinks his thesis is that I can throw evidence that ""quality of content"" does impact the price people are willing to pay; his example of newsstand pricing is more about the extent to which magazine retailers can ""tax"" retail magazine purchasers than about the underlying economics.<p>The various and sundry evidence for ""quality of content"" impacting price:<p>- subscriptions (which cut out the middleman) clearly have what he deems ""better content"" priced at a marked premium to inferior content; perhaps ""newsstands"" are just a pathological retail channel?<p>- the subscription price also gives nice upper bounds on publication costs; these are pretty tiny (rounding in a way prejudicially to my argument: 50 pages per issue and 50 issues per year of time magazine => .8c/page; given the similar production values of the economist we can safely assume it's similar). I'll say more on this later.<p>- the consumer price per unit of content varies widely between genres. Look at ""Parabola"", a new-agey magazine: it's 9.50 / issue at the newsstand, is always 128 pages, and is printed on 5""x8"" paper. When you correct for page size you get ~17c per ""page"" (really: per 8.5x11"" paper's worth of printed words). Do you have an explanation for why content-units of ""Parabola"" sell for higher prices than content-units of the economist other than some difference in the quality of their contents? If time and the economist selling for ~8.x cents per page @ the newsstand is evidence of the market value of their content why is this not evidence for the market value of ""Parabola""<p>I can do this all day: prices per content unit vary much more widely than the narrow range PG's anecdote suggests; this is true @ the subscription price and @ the newsstand price. You'll neither find find consistent cost-per-page to cost-of-product multipliers nor will you find that going super heavypaper + glossy ink (with concomitant jump in cost-per-page) has any obvious impact on cost of product either (cf vogue or seventeen or W).<p>After awhile occam's razor will suggest: ""newsstand"" prices aren't good measurements of magazine prices (compared to subscriptions); regardless of where you measure different types of content sell at different prices per unit of content; likeliest explanation is that quality of content has a lot to do with what price something sells at (which is why there aren't any $20 weekly newsmagazines).<p>Additionally: publishers are already quite close to the post-medium world, in the sense that their costs-of-publication are already quite small vis-a-vis price.<p>An alternative explanation for the phenomenon PG is observing is something like:<p>- (a) each type of content will fetch a different price; this price has a lot to do with what the content is<p>- (b) for a given ""type"" of content there's a constraint on what is involved in producing an instance in it; eg: there are no 300 or 500 page newsweeklies, but there are 50-100 page newsweeklies<p>- (c) within each ""type"" prices will cluster around some central point but higher quality content will fetch higher prices<p>- (d) within the constraints of the genre there's a strong correlation with longer == better<p>- (e) together, (b) (c) and (d) make it look roughly like the time + economist situation: 'economist > time but priced < time per content unit'<p>...but b/c publishing costs are such a small part of the price to consumer (which has more to do firstly with content genre and secondly with relative quality of content within genre) the ""length"" as such isn't a big factor in setting price; the relationship described in (e) is literally a red herring.<p>You can differentiate this scenario from pg's by checking across content genres; if prices-to-consumer are hovering within a narrow range per unit price his looks better, but if price per content unit vary widely across genres mine looks better.",1253545978

834724,comment,834267,834478,0,0,n8agrin,,,"Perhaps this is a tangent, but the notion of <i>...creating a cozy home for unproductive people...</i> resonated with something I learned from a kiteboard instructor, of all people:<p>When I was learning to kiteboard I was out one day for a couple hours, had a good session and decided I was ready to get out of the water.  I wasn't exhausted, but I was getting tired.<p>My instructor came speeding up next to me and asked me what I was doing. I explained I was getting tired and wanted to head in. He tossed his really nice new kiteboard my way, told me to give him the old beat up kiteboard I was riding and to go back out. I was reluctant but he pushed me and I caved in. My session went from good to great, and I think my kiteboarding skills improved more in that extra hour than in many of the days prior.<p>Later that night I was telling my instructor how well I did on the newer board and how I had been ready to give up for the day.  He told me ""Sometimes you just have to push yourself that extra 5%, even when you think you can't."" That statement has been a guiding principle throughout my life ever since.<p>Any time I feel like I'm in too much in my comfort zone, not challenging myself to learn new things, or feel I'm incapable of doing something, I remember my kiteboarder's adage and try to push myself just a little bit more. So far it seems to have worked well.",1253545749

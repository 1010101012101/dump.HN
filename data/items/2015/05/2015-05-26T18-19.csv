It is easy to use PowerPoint to cover up the fact you don&#x27;t have a clue what you are talking about by using lots of flashy effects and &quot;bling&quot; that PowerPoint offers.<p>The style I prefer is rather minimal and mainly uses PowerPoint as a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; to give me cues on what I want to tell my audience. This encourages me to focus on the audience rather than the computer running PowerPoint and speak more freely. An occasional image can help illustrate a point, but I tend to use them very sparingly.
(The disadvantage is that someone simply looking at the slides afterwards won&#x27;t have a clue what I said, but I can live with that.) The feedback I have received was very positive, although I never spoke to Marketing people who seem to be all about the pretty pictures and flashy transitions.<p>My point, I guess, is that PowerPoint can be abused, badly, but I am not sure if it is fair to blame it for that. The world would not be <i>that</i> much worse off without PowerPoint, but people looking to distract from their cluelessness will find a way to do so anyway. A more realistic article might be titled &quot;Use PowerPoint only when nothing else will do&quot; or &quot;Stop talking <i>at</i> your audience and start talking <i>to</i> them&quot;.<p>EDIT: Fixed a typo",1432666650

If you click on a YouTube link, a video your computer has never seen before is playing in less than five seconds, streaming over the internet.</i><p>Nothing about this is &quot;web&quot; specific. That&#x27;s just &quot;streaming over the internet&quot; as you said. Lots of native apps do it too (for both music and video, internet radio, iTunes video rentals, etc.). The reason we didn&#x27;t have this as widespread before was limited bandwidth connections (a limitation of internet, not of being native).<p>><i>You can instantly seek to any part of the video, even if it hours long. You can speed it up to 2x, or slow it down to 0.25x, without changing the pitch of the sound. If you have a Chromecast, you can display the video on your TV instead. Nothing in 2000 had a remotely similar feature set</i><p>Again, nothing about what you describe is web specific. Native can do it all and do it better and with less battery crippling cpu usage.<p>And nothing described -instant seek, pitch shifting with retime, etc- was impossible in native video players in 2000 (or even 1995), while all of it was impossible for the web in 2000.<p>Which also means things possible for native apps now are impossible for web apps now, which makes sense since native is a superset of what functionality is available in a web sandbox, and with faster potential speed. (And of course being web is not a requirement for accessing internet resources).",1432666641

That includes three things that neither Xcode nor Android Studio does:<p>1) Interface Builder and Android Studio&#x27;s layout editor are not meant for designers. (Seriously, try giving them to a Photoshop-educated designer.)<p>2) Xcode and Android Studio let you define views, but neither of them produces the controller-level code from visual designs. (We do that and also produce model-level code for simple apps; there&#x27;s a plugin API for more complex situations, or you can of course do that in handwritten code.)<p>3) Cross-platform. Anything you do in Xcode or Android Studio needs to be rebuilt from scratch on the other platform.<p><i>...the idioms, best practices, device capabilities, and user expectations are different on each platform.</i><p>I feel that this doesn&#x27;t hold true anymore. iOS 7+ and Android 4+ have largely converged on a flat style where a 3rd party app can define its own style that is easily compatible with both.<p>With Windows 10, even Microsoft is coming into this &quot;common mobile&quot; UI fold. They&#x27;re giving up on the idiosyncratic (and interesting) Windows Phone concepts, and instead adopting a generic look that makes it easier to port Android/iOS apps directly.

The rail industry has figured out how to do Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) quite well, using the elasticity of steel.<p><a href=""http://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog/2011/03/08/distorted-railway-lines-in-the-christchurch-earthquake/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog/2011/03/08/distorted-rail...</a><p>Similarly the tube for the Hyperloop doesn&#x27;t HAVE to free-float against its foundations.  It might be easier or harder depending on various factors to work on expansion joints or doing the tube equivalent of CWR.  You&#x27;d probably work on both to figure out which is easier in the long run.<p>Considering that it&#x27;s a 9-11ft diameter tube with about 1&quot; wall thickness, it&#x27;s going to be pretty stiff, especially relative to traditional rails.  The moment of inertia means that it should be very resistance to bending or buckling under compression and under tension steel is usually very good.<p>Given that there are going to be plenty of turns that the track has to make, I would look at doing a combination of two things:<p>1.  Working towards a CWR style solution<p>2.  Allow some movement so that the corners can take up the slack as the tube expands<p>The turns are very gradual and sweeping.  But you could imagine that there&#x27;s a virtual intersection between two straight portions that you determine by drawing lines from the straight portions until they meet.  The actual turn will take place far from here, but it&#x27;s instructive.  So as the tube expands, the actual curve is going to move ever so slightly from the neutral position towards the virtual intersection.  So long as there is enough room on the pylons to accommodate this, things will be pretty good.  The tube will go from being curved 0.1 degrees per 100 feet to 0.105 degrees per 100 feet (or something like this) but this can be designed for and ensured that it doesn&#x27;t cause the tube to buckle or collapse.  It&#x27;s engineering, not the utter unknown.",1432666122

Or to phase it another way, a school may teach them to use PP the software but doesn&#x27;t teach them how to put on a good presentation using it.<p>One key thing people need to learn is: Slides exist to supplement what is being said. If your presentation doesn&#x27;t work without the slides then you&#x27;re doing it wrong.

Fine, I&#x27;ll just bundle the web app with Webkit (io.js) and they&#x27;ll be happy, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the app breaking in new browser versions.<p>Browser based applications are much easier to distribute and adds a security layer, so that you do not have to worry as much about trojan/viruses, compared to installing executables from cr4cksnh4cks.com<p>The browser is the perfect container. And it also helps a bit that the API&#x27;s are super easy to work with. Making even the novice programmer productive and able to create powerful applications.<p>One reason why native is bigger on the smart-phone market is that Google, Apple and Microsoft want to completely control their ecosystem and lock people in. What I can not understand though, is why Google does it, as the majority of their income still comes from the word wide web. They have however made major advances on that front lately, to there is still hope.<p>As the virtualization technology advances, the gap between running on bare metal and in a container continuously decreases.

But there&#x27;s a problem.<p>The problem is there&#x27;s no stuff like &quot;web/native app&quot;: there&#x27;s a bunch of functionality that solves user&#x27;s problem to greater or lesser extent. Although there are needs which are technically complex, usually what the user can ask for is pretty simple. Clean UI, button here, button there, some lights and pop-up notifications, a couple of graphics, which actually represent something pretty trivial internally. Sometimes the data needs to be pushed to or retrieved from some centralized storage or it needs to talk to some other &quot;service&quot;. &quot;Browser&quot; is absolutely awful and pointless invention, but unfortunately we have accepted it somehow and learned to satisfy the needs of typical customer using it. HTML might be stupid and CSS might be inconsistent, but it&#x27;s actually pretty easy to make the UI user wants with that and a handful of js code.<p>As a bonus, it will work on Linux, on Windows, on Mac, your Android phone and even some not-a-real-OS which happens to have a capable browser.<p>And what we have on the desktop? I don&#x27;t know a single good UI framework for Linux (&quot;good&quot; in a sense it would make it easy to achieve what I want). There&#x27;s somewhat usable WPF for Windows, which still doesn&#x27;t really allow to implement anything user could wish for as easily, as I&#x27;d do with HTML. Somewhat usable, but pretty verbose is Android UI framework. I don&#x27;t know what happens on Mac. And, yeah, none would be compatible between different platforma (except Qt, maybe, which is overly complicated by itself).<p>So there isn&#x27;t much choice between &quot;web and native&quot;.

We completely redesigned and rebuilt one of their web applications. The whole time, my manager kept telling me they were going to convert me to full-time. Since this was only my second contracting gig, I thought I had it made, and stopped talking with recruiters thinking I was about to land a sweet full-time gig.<p>Two weeks before the project was set to wrap up (we already had a very successful &quot;soft-launch&quot;) I was told I&#x27;d be done after the launch. I was pretty pissed, thinking I was just taken advantage of, not really understanding this is pretty much par for the course with being a contractor.<p>I was out of work for just under a month. The rough part was essentially starting from scratch after telling recruiters I wasn&#x27;t looking anymore. You have to restart contacting your contacts, then waiting for an opportunity to get in front of someone, then get an interview, or two, or in one case, three before hearing back.<p>At the time I was doing a lot of vanilla front-end work. Lots of static sites, HTML5, CSS3 and some low level Javascript. I didn&#x27;t have to learn anything new (the era of big JS frameworks and tools was still years away) so my transition was pretty easy from being unemployed to landing my next contracting gig.<p>The lessons I learned from the experience is to never stop talking to your network and recruiters. Once recruiters think you&#x27;re off the market, they&#x27;ll stop contacting you and then its up to you to contact them. It&#x27;s always good to keep as much information flowing to you as possible, no matter what situation you&#x27;re in. Even in my last full-time gig, I was still interviewing and talking to people up until I decided to leave.<p>Also, never assume as a contractor your employer will bring you on full-time no matter what kind of bullshit and blue skies they keep selling you.

Then, as usual, company hires some gunslinger C-levels, and began outsourcing the entire department, and immediately labelled me &quot;redundant&quot;.
For me, it seemed like a pretty good deal: i was going to get severance and a planned exit several months out, for which i could just pick up another job. mean time, i would just be providing a bit of knowledge transfer.
however, my immediate boss found the whole scenario absurd and reached out to a different department to see if he had any openings. long story short, i ended up getting a better offer from the other department (something like 10-15% bump), and a start date a couple weeks out. 
Once the previous department head got notified, they tried to put the brakes on it (company wanted the ability to &quot;change their mind&quot; if transition wasnt hitting milestones). By then, it was too late.<p>it was definitely a learning experience.. a few life lessons i took away:<p><pre><code>  * networking, even inside your employer is critical to success
  * make sure you are always getting paid your market value
  * never personally sacrifice your career, health, or happiness for free (i would even go so far to say for anything)
  * employers owe you nothing but your wages 
  * dont buy into the &quot;we are family&quot; mantra, culture and leadership can change and leave you unemployed and out of date
  * you owe them nothing more than an honest days work.
  * having a good manager is way more important than whether the company sucks or not.. but remember managers can leave too</code></pre>",1432665458

In particular, there is one aspect that he fails to mention and that I view as one of the best aspects of web development: the stateless request-response-replace-UI model of remote application development.  This model is incredibly simple for developers to understand and work with, and eliminates a whole slew of complex problems found in traditional client-server development.<p>(I would note that these problems are being reintroduced with client-side web technologies like Angular and de-reintroduced by technologies like intercooler.js.)",1432664982

They have facebook for humblebragging about their long term personal aspirations and achievements. They have twitter for sharing unnoteworthy small thoughts. They have instagram for sharing noteworthy moments that aren&#x27;t necessarily major life events, and they have snapchat for showing what they&#x27;re doing right now.<p>They really don&#x27;t want something that merges these in any way. The reason being, for any given user publishing content on any of these networks, they all are publishing to different audiences. I want my parents to see my linkedin and to see my facebook. I don&#x27;t want them to see my twitter necessarily. I don&#x27;t want them to see my snapchat. (FWIW, in reality I don&#x27;t have facebook, twitter, linkedin, or snapchat, but this is just an example of how 18-24 y/os think.)<p>Google had a fix for the issue of audience with g+ and circles, but they fell short on implementation, I think. There weren&#x27;t enough different ways to share content and shape your profile, pretty much just posts. If they had made better ways to publish temporary posts, static info (like resume and work experience), and to organize views of the site by circles rather than merging them all together, I think they&#x27;d have succeeded.<p>The idea that snapchat can pivot to be anything other than an extension on MMS is ridiculous to me. (It doesn&#x27;t even do that now, by the way. No group snapchats. The stupid filters like speed you&#x27;re traveling and the current time look absolutely terrible.)<p>I think users of snapchat like it for what it is, quick pictures shared to a few people that you think might enjoy it. Nothing you want permanently on the web. Maybe it can become something like periscope or meerkat. I think there&#x27;s also a market for advertising in the &#x27;featured stories&#x27; part of the app, and from the article, it sounds like where they&#x27;re headed.<p>But their moves like snapcash, and any aspirations that are separate from sharing temporary moments? Completely bewildering to me. I fear they&#x27;re trying to become something their users don&#x27;t want snapchat to be.<p>One thing I will say, Spiegel seems like a really cool guy with a heart in the right place and is probably a genius.

That worked until it didn&#x27;t, and in 2001 the banks stopped being tolerant of late loan repayments from the company.<p>We were &quot;emergency sold&quot; to a large company in the field in a deal that took something like two weeks to arrange. I think the top brass ended up losing all their paper riches. Oh well, it was their decisions that got the company there anyway.<p>Anyway, the big company wanted to cut staff, so they laid off literally half the purchased company. They did it by seniority, but even after 5 years I was the newest person on my team.  I got a great deal though. Four months pay for severance, and an extra two months bonus to stay on for two months and finish my current project (bonus on top of paying me to work for two months). So six months total. Living frugally, it was plenty enough for at least a year.<p>I used the money to move to Los Angeles, where I floundered for a while because I didn&#x27;t have a network to tap into.

Over time my new work became more and more web oriented, and learning the stack was something new and fun. But a lot to learn.<p>Eventually the big company hired back a lot of the laid off people.  One guy just took a six month vacation and then was hired back at a higher salary and a signing bonus. A manager went to work for a competitor for a year at a higher salary, and then came back to an even higher one at the original company, also with a hefty signing bonus. If I&#x27;d stayed in town I probably would have too.

Luckily he was very good about it and the severance was substantial plus all my shares vested immediately. I had a new job agreed to and signed within two hours of the conversation with my VP (with someone I used to work with at a company I was very familiar with). No interviews, no anything- I just said that I was available. It really helps to be someone people want to work with. It doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re the best at what you do, but that you can be counted on and aren&#x27;t so &#x27;bristly&#x27; that people don&#x27;t mind having to spend a lot of time with you.<p>The biggest turn in my career was the time I probably should&#x27;ve been fired but wasn&#x27;t- but left within weeks anyway. I had just come out of a weeklong stay out of the hospital (received multiple blood transfusions) and was getting pressured as we had a huge client engagement I _needed_ to be on site for. I literally went from the hospital on a Monday to all day meetings with a client team and their other potential vendors on Tuesday through Thursday. Needless to say, I felt AWFUL. Was pretty damn tired, stressed out, and also having my phone explode with emails from the week and change of work I&#x27;d missed while in the hospital. I also looked like shit. There was nothing I could do that didn&#x27;t have me looking like I just got out of the hospital, no matter how now my suit looked. After Thursday the potential client called up our sales partner and told him they wouldn&#x27;t be moving forward with us as I seemed inattentive, distant, and that I checked my phone too frequently during the meetings. This of course caused a storm at the office and it was made plainly clear that not only was that my last and only chance, but I pretty much wouldn&#x27;t be working on that sales partner&#x27;s accounts anymore. We found out later there was funny business between the client and one of the vendors and we were never really going to win it anyway but that didn&#x27;t help my cause. At the end of the day I should&#x27;ve said that I flat out couldn&#x27;t make it or have been able to summon some super human powers to not look like how I felt.

I apologize, and will continue answering assuming you&#x27;re talking in good faith.<p>&quot;I have never said that he is lying. I have implied that the situation might be aggrandized/exaggerated, or a very atypical one-off, absolutely.&quot;<p>Patrick has explicitly said it wasn&#x27;t a one off, and stated very explicit rates. So if you are implying that this isn&#x27;t true, I&#x27;m not sure how that isn&#x27;t implying he&#x27;s lying. (And I will point out that many of the people in this thread also think you are calling him a liar - rationally speaking, if the way you communicate leads a lot of people to a misunderstanding of your statement, I suggest that you might want to change something).<p>But let&#x27;s not quibble over semantics. I&#x27;m fine calling it &quot;exaggerating&quot; if you prefer, and I&#x27;d argue just as strongly that he <i>isn&#x27;t</i> exaggerating.<p>&quot;Now you claim that there&#x27;s all sort of evidence of these $10K, $20K, $30K, $40K per week engagements. There is none. Absolutely none, beyond a cofounder and a serial booster who suddenly claims to have lots of experience being a consumer of consultants.&quot;<p>So, Thomas being Patrick&#x27;s partner is very new. He was for many years the head of a company, during which time he <i>also</i> said he hired Patrick. Again, this was long before they worked together. You can verify that Thomas&#x27; company existed, and was acquired, here: <a href=""http://www.csoonline.com/article/2135259/security-leadership/ncc-group-acquires-matasano-security.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csoonline.com/article/2135259/security-leadership...</a><p>I&#x27;m also not sure what a &quot;serial booster&quot; is in your statement, I&#x27;ll be happy if you can clarify.<p>I can&#x27;t explicitly prove the engagement rates, but if you want an example of a very well known and respectable company that explicitly talks about Patrick being their consultant, you can read Patrick&#x27;s article on Fog Creek Software&#x27;s blog, which starts:<p>&quot;Editor’s Note: Patrick McKenzie has done some work with Fog Creek last October and this May, focusing on improving our marketing.&quot;<p><a href=""http://blog.fogcreek.com/our-marketing-is-up-fog-creek-and-what-we-did-about-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fogcreek.com/our-marketing-is-up-fog-creek-and-w...</a><p>Again, all I&#x27;m saying is, rationally speaking, lets look at the evidence - despite your protestations about Thomas being Patrick&#x27;s partner, this is a <i>very new development</i>. Thomas has been talking about Patrick for years, and verifies Patrick&#x27;s rate. Thomas is verifiably the owner of a consultancy that was acquired, also making him able to verify those rates.<p>Fog Creek, a large software company, <i>also</i> talks about Patrick working for them. That&#x27;s <i>another</i> verificaiton that he&#x27;s worked with these kinds of customers (not verification of the rate, though).<p>By the way, Patrick didn&#x27;t &quot;suddenly&quot; talk about these rates - he&#x27;s been talking about charging at least $10k per week for a few years, but only recently mentioned the specific prices.<p>Here&#x27;s a question - what would it take to convince you that Patrick is <i>not</i> exaggerating? Cause at least from where I&#x27;m standing, it looks like all the evidence points in one direction. This is without even looking at the fact that lots of other well known members of the community have met and talked with Patrick, and vouch for his honesty and his methods. Also not looking at the ton of content which a <i>lot of people</i> have used to better themselves.<p>For the record, I also owned a consultancy, which was acquired by a large company. I didn&#x27;t charge Patrick&#x27;s rates, but I have no doubt they are achievable (in certain lines of work, mind you).",1432664656

I&#x27;ve exchanged 7 emails with him, regarding a phone call he wanted to have with me, about something that is in one of my areas of expertise.  We had said phone call that lasted around 1 hour.  He asked me questions, I answered them.  No money was exchanged (nor expected) and no quid pro quo&#x27;s expected.

I think that is largely untrue and he would have been better served with a summary paragraph describing appropriate ways to compare bill rate to employee take home pay.<p>None of that has anything to do with this particular post, which as I&#x27;ve mentioned, only adds to Patrick&#x27;s credibility as it is an outside entity stating that the numbers, at least with regard to BCC, are truthful.",1432664596

But I&#x27;m going to do it anyway and try as best as I can to avoid the middlebrow dismissal.<p>Hyperloop is a nerd dream and it doesn&#x27;t have a chance at <i>financial</i> success. The fundamental problem has nothing to do with the technology, which appears amazing <i>and</i> viable. If anyone can overcome the few nagging engineering issues, Musk and Co are the ones to do it. No, it has to do with not having a viable market plan, suffering from very common delusional assumptions in business models that have fucked over railroad capitalists for well over 2 centuries now, including three major railroad bubbles (Railway Mania as well as the Panics of 1893 and 1873). [1]<p>The faulty assumption is that the viability of the railroad hinges on the ability to go from major city to major city as fast as possible. This is only partially true. Of course you want to be as fast as possible, but the worst possible way to be as fast as possible is to eliminate stops in smaller cities and towns, which is exactly what Hyperloop is planning on doing. Those small towns usually end up being the most prominent drivers of revenue, overshadowing the large-city-to-large-city revenue by an order of magnitude. Even the CHSRA business plan shows that their revenue model does not depend heavily on the SF<->LA passenger volume.<p>You can typically think of demand for travel in terms of cultural dependencies. I have a need for employment, therefore I travel to work. I have a need to visit family, therefore I travel to family. I have a need for tuna, therefore I travel to the wharf market. I have a need for a visa, therefore I travel to the embassy. These cultural dependencies result in a demand distribution for travel that roughly fits a power law profile. The demand for near travel (x > 0) is exponentially greater than further travel (y > x). It is not hard to speculate that the passenger miles travelled by Angelenos traveling to work outweighs the aggregate passenger miles travelled between Los Angeles to San Francisco on any given day...LA County&#x27;s Metropolitan Transit Authority alone accounts for 5.4M passenger miles a day [2], approximately equivalent to 14,000 passengers traveling between SF and LA. More importantly, the larger the city, the more your cultural needs are met by your own city. If you live in Los Angeles, your probabilistic need to travel to San Francisco is <i>much</i> lower than someone from Fresno, because your needs are mostly met by Los Angeles. When I lived in Stockton, I travelled to Oakland or San Francisco almost on a weekly basis...but now that I live in Seattle, I travel outside of the Puget Sound region maybe 2-3 times per year.<p>In the very beginning, this faulty assumption was actually a <i>safer</i> assumption to make than it is today, due to the lack of airlines and automobiles. The railroad literally was the fastest way to get from city to city, with no exceptions. But now it isn&#x27;t. Once you go over about 300 miles, a well timed trip by plane is often as fast or faster (a lot of people will say that 500 miles is the threshold of competitiveness, but travel market share peaks and then drops off after about 300 miles). Under 100 miles, the freedom of a car to leave without a schedule often makes cars faster. Any time you have competition, you lower your market share, with your comparative competitiveness determining how much market share you lose.<p>So this is how it has played out hundreds if not thousands of times in the history of railroads: 1) Some big city businessman sees a slow trip to a city that he commonly has to travel to. He sees a demand for faster transportation. He throws together a business plan that makes the correct assumption that City A has X people, City B has Y people, and a fast connection between them will yield Z% market share of the travel D demand between them. He figures that in order to get that fast travel time, he can only stop at the largest cities in between...or possibly no stops at all! He then looks up a similar city or railroad (lets say B & S railroad), looks at ridership figures, and tries to back into D, and then inflates the Z figure to reflect the fact that his railroad will be faster because there are fewer stops. Therefore his revenue model becomes X * 0.5D * Z * P + Y * 0.5D * Z * P (where P == ticket price) 2) He sells some stocks and bonds (or in the case of modern capitalism, lobbies for grants), and builds a railroad. From this article, it looks like this step is starting. 3) After a few months, he realizes his model is inaccurate. At this point, he will do one of two things: either advertise more or remove stops to make it faster, both of which exacerbate the cash flow problem. 4) After about a year, he is bankrupt. The bondholders reclaim as much as they can by selling the railroad to some other capitalist who will with high assurance do exactly the same thing, but with a greater chance of success due to a much lower investment. And thus plays out the railroad consolidation game.<p>In terms of the model, his failure was actually three failures multiplied together. 1) He assumed that the ridership of B & S railroad was primarily between termini. This meant his D figure was too low because he vastly underestimated the demand to and from the small intermediate cities. 2) He assumed that B & S ridership figures were rides at full terminus-to-terminus prices, therefore inflating P. 3) He assumed that D was a linear function of population, ignoring that the larger the city the lower the cultural need for travel, thereby inflating D. The only thing he got right was X and Y.<p>The practical implication of this is that if you want a successful, profit-maximizing railroad, you need to optimize the need for speed with the need to pick up passengers along the way. If you are a capitalist that cares about maximizing profit, this unfortunately means having a railroad that looks like a slow kludge, because it means making unglamourous stops in unglamourous towns. And it also means that technophile idealism puts you at a competitive disadvantage.<p>[1] for more information/history, this is a great writeup, with a couple chapters that clearly describe this delusion. It is very long, but amazingly interesting and worth reading outside of this reference for anyone interested in technocapitalism or bubble economics.  <a href=""http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/hallucinations.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/hallucinations.pdf</a>)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Documents/FactBook/2013-APTA-Fact-Book.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Documents/FactBook/...</a>",1432664017

Since I was already bored with the credit risk project I had been on for a long time, I secretly had preliminary talks with the energy trading group and they were interested in bringing me on board as soon as the lock-down lifted, but that could be another half a year or more.  In the summer I even got a job offer from an ETRM consulting company but decided not to jump ship since the old-school data-loading scripts they&#x27;d have me writing sounded boring.  When the financial world went really berserk in late 2008 the lay-offs at the Houston office were very slow and sporadic, so I think they kept those under control to keep people from getting spooked.  Then in the first week of January 2009 my manager called me into my office and said they had to let me go: &quot;But we&#x27;d like for you to work till the end of the month, and we&#x27;ll count you as an employee till the end of February, and we&#x27;ll give you 3 months of severance after that.&quot;  Such a  different experience from my software developer friend at Schlumberger who had been escorted to the door within 20 minutes on the same day I received my notice (although at the bank the dev team never saw production data or got even close to the production servers, so we couldn&#x27;t be dangerous).  I was sooooo glad I hadn&#x27;t quit in 2008 because I already wanted to leave but being sent away with all that cash was a great bonus to a young single guy like me!  Then I felt empowered to join a crazy fun Boston startup that eventually crashed and burned, but that&#x27;s another story.  :)",1432663779

There were a lot of different technologies in the jobs I lost and I don&#x27;t think they had anything to do with it.<p>I think it was first my need and then tendency to go for the low-end development jobs, usually where the tech is a support role in the company, they don&#x27;t have great software development management which includes not great hiring practices, they use antiquated technology and have to take whatever developers they can get.<p>The first danger sign is if there is suddenly a large dropoff in communication between your boss and yourself, and if you feel ostracized from the company/dept.  Usually word gets around before you are going to be let go and your teammates often have heard and are distancing themselves.<p>There is often a &quot;come-to-Jesus&quot; meeting with your boss whereby they give it their best shot to give you a clear last warning--depending on the level of your manager&#x27;s skill you may not even recognize this as a come-to-Jesus meeting.  They may ask if everything is okay and if there is anything they can do to help you get your work done.<p>The last sign of impending job loss is when they have a sudden need for you to completely document everything you do. Sometimes this will coincide with a company-wide push for the same thing, sometime not.<p>In my experience it always happens on a Friday.  You are called into a meeting whereby you are let go, and if it is a big company you never can log onto your computer again, they escort you out the door with your stuff in a box and you go about your business.<p>As far as finding new jobs, that has been challenging but not impossible. The average amount of time it took me to find a new job was six months. Sometimes I did work on learning new skills during my time off but mostly I spent my free time worrying. The new job I found often paid significantly more than the job I had just been fired from. If you keep along the low-end I found many companies did not check references and had no kind of coding test.<p>These situations are never completely clear cut, usually it was mostly my fault but still some their fault.

An isolated population in an engineered ecosystem on Earth survives X with higher probability.<p>I&#x27;ll even make a positive case for Earth being safer: Out of events which could destroy even a physically isolated, rad-hardened population, all of the most probable would also eradicate life on Mars.

1) you can circumvent this problem by randomizing your mac between probes, as apple already does, and that doesn&#x27;t help with the threat we present<p>2) ssids are not unique - when it says &quot;airport&quot; it can be any airport. When you have access to the mac of the device, you can pin point it uniquely - that&#x27;s the threat we present.<p>3) with the threat you link, you theoretically might be able to recover some of the past locations of the user where they did connect to WiFi. With the threat we present you get the location history with time resolution of up to 20 seconds, whether the user connects to WiFi or not, and even if they disable WiFi, and you don&#x27;t have to control any routers. I would say this constitutes a novelty.<p>=== EDIT ====<p>4) the link only mentions a theoretical possibility, we show that the threat is real based on real data collected over 6 months about multiple people.",1432663301

It's only manageable at that scale because we work hard to design it to be predictable.<p>There are a lot of complex and emergent systems that demonstrate this property of following simple rules but exhibiting complex behaviors. Conway's game of life, rule 110 in basic cellular automata, how ants work together, fireflies blink in synchrony without global communication are all examples.<p>And while none of these demonstrate that computers can produce consciousness, they give a hint that computers may be able to do so, despite it following rules to the T.",1330099012

There's a real level of momentum here because people don't want to bothered with things rendering funny or not having the same feature-set as their colleagues and clients.  Every IT guy knows this because half the helpdesk tickets are ""How can I open this .pages thing?"" ""They sent us the powerpoints but all the audio files are missing exentions!"" etc thats common with basic OSX to Windows office issues, let alone a entirely different office suite. Sure hackers and computer nerds can do this stuff with ease, but remember, offices are all about the lowest common denominator.<p>OO and LO are nice for basic tasks and when interoperability isn't very important. Once you enter the realm of business, suddenly track changes needs to work and images not being aligned properly is suddenly a big deal.<p>LO and OO are almost identical products. OO has been at the stage its at now for 5 years. If it hasn't hurt Office by now it probably never will.  I suspect OO is yet another ""year of the linux desktop"" that always 2 or 3 years away.<p>/ITguy",1330098756

A decent cafeteria that actually provides fresh meals is a heavenly gift and beats ordering and take-away pretty much all the time, both in quality and price so if you can pull it off, by all means provide that for your employees! If I was to switch jobs, a good cafeteria has become a must for me now and it would actually be a factor holding me back.<p>2. Eating together, focus on ""family"" in the office. At the IT company I used to work for, we had a small kitchen and a huge table for everyone and very often we would end up eating lunch together, cooked by us or just ordered pizza/kebaps, and we would crack open a beer in the evening, we would play DotA over the LAN in the office until late at night, we would have a movies night, we'd celebrate successes and our xmas party in the office quite often and if an employee wanted to, they could even use the office for a private party with close friends or have their pen+paper rounds there because the table was really damn amazing and the location was right downtown, easy to reach for everyone. What this came down to: this office was way more than just an office; it was a place were we worked and were you also spent countless amazing and fun hours as well. Without failure every time I stepped into that office, I felt a bit ""at home"" away from home and it was just always a great, relaxed atmosphere and everyone just loved being in the office because you instantly associated it with more than just work.<p>Emphasizing and acting on the simple idea that the office should be more than just a boring 9-5 work place, more than just a regular office, was definitely one of the best things our boss did there.",1330097658

It helps, but there are so many other factors.<p>The problem as we've learned from our foray into the adult industry is that there is very little access or ways to raise money for anything adult. Traditionally movie studios were the ones funding all the shoots, but as the internet grew up fast (ie BitTorrent & tube sites) the business models didn't and now since people aren't buying porn dvd's or signing up to membership websites like they used to this means less content being made and more aversion to trying anything new (that's why there are thousands of porn parodies). The business model has stagnated and as for real innovation, we haven't seen much...<p>So we figured if we can put the future of the adult industry in the public's hands and of those who are passionate about the movies, books, or art combined they can try new things that otherwise your traditional studios / publishers would never attempt. Of course this is no different than what kickstarter and other crowdfunding platforms do for their users, but adult as of yet has no such platform.<p>That's the theory behind what we want to do...in practice...well that's yet to be determined.",1330097651

Native compilation is too sweet a prize to give up; -webkit-box-shadow, the fucked box model, <video>, <canvas>, and friends are no substitute for a real, efficient software stack that isn't incredibly bloated and underperforming. The sooner HN at large realizes this, the sooner it can get to working on things that are actually new and interesting.<p>The only reason the web is considered the end-all-be-all is because people want to reach ""average users"" who can't handle installing native software and don't want the inconvenience of maintaining their computers' software. They never will, but that doesn't mean that the future of computing should be decided by the least common denominator of end-users.<p>The current trend in ""web technologies"" is to implement a wrapper for every native technology. When we finally finish, we'll end up with what can't possibly work better than what we had before, and it'll have taken incredible amounts of effort for programmers to optimize it enough that it's even usable for real jobs (see javascript engines at large).

IBM had  conventional dress codes; Microsoft - it was very much like a college campus. The only difference in how they lived, the hours they kept and the way they dressed, between a college campus and Microsoft was that Microsoft bought the equipment. They all wore their shorts and half of them  wore sandals or no shoes. Microsoft bought a lot of T-shirts and things for them. There weren't set hours - the management system was to let people pick or sign up for what they were going to do, and it was up to them to do it.  So there was very little management attention over directing people or telling  them what to do - it was a very empowered work force. And my suspicion was that that was the way IBM was in the 1930s and 1940s. They were much more formal, because the time was much more formal in terms of dress.

Not really by choice but how work led me. I picked up tips and tricks in several languages. Being able to use more than one language is like having more than one toolbox for the job. My dad had a toolbox for plumbing, another one for electrical, another one for general stuff.<p>Knowing more than one language is akin to being well traveled, being less ignorant of other cultures and people and generally noticing that people everywhere have more in common with how they live (or code).<p>Maybe English is as close as we have for a general language, perhaps folks who are a little zealous about their language of choice and inadvertently look down on others are wanting their language to become the english of programming.<p>Maybe we see difference when we want and connection when we want.<p>If we look in the Web space, the reality is most languages  paired with a capable MVC framework for the Web, all are pretty capable in many of the same areas.<p>If we have an equally capable Ruby (with rails or Siatra), Python (with Django), PHP (with Cake or CodeIgniter) and let's an asp.NET MVC developer.. They would probably all come out with a pretty similar result.<p>First, all of these languages are all pretty old.  Started in the 90's.  The frameworks that we get attached to being hip, to me are our equivalent of culture, what's in fashion and capable today, ready to be replaced tomorrow by the next fashionable thing.<p>The tools don't guarantee success.  Work with tools that are more rigid, and you have one kinds of problems.  Work without any structure and you can make a horrible mess in any language.  After having seen messes in every language, I am not convinced that any language is incapable of making a mess.<p>There are few things, and few times where any framework + language will provide a huge difference over another time wise. Where you save time in one, it'll take more time elsewhere compared to another framework + language.<p>If there is a language that truly gives you a feature, or an edge for your specific app, so be it.

I think electrostatics are a bit easier to visualize than magnetostatics.<p>There’s also a good analogous physical situation. Imagine you have a rubber sheet stretched into a plane. The challenge is to create a local minimum in the sheet by pushing it up in places. If you push it up with a tube to try to create a bowl, instead you’ll get a flat circle on top of the tube.<p>My freshman year physics professor had us play with a program that simulated kinetic physics for point charges. You could “glue” charges to a plane, and then release other charges to see how they would respond. The end of the assignment said “Try to create a cage that can hold a charged particle.

For example, to use precise GC, a C program must never extract a pointer from a variable typed as long, at least not if a collection may have occurred since the value was stored in the variable.</i><p>Yeah, definitely not going to work with any large program that has been touched by an average C programmer.<p><i>These extra constraints are, however, satisfied by normal C programming practices.</i><p>-snort-",1241109674

587006,comment,586798,586798,0,0,randomtask,,,"An interesting idea. Just some comments:<p>The explanation of how it works is pretty confusing. For instance you say ""As an example, if a consumer spends half of his time reading the wikipedia, the wikipedia would get a $4.50 credit at the end of the month."" Does that mean that the service costs $9 a month or $10 because you've removed 10% for the free pool? If so why do I have to figure this out from that bit of text? If this is just an example amount then a better explanation like ""Say a user pays $10 a month, and they spend half their time reading wikipedia, then at the end of the month wikipedia is paid $4.50 from that user.""<p>I would remove the formula on the ""how"" page. That seems like something you might need to change later. Perhaps say that producers get a share of the revenue provided by users' subscription fees that is proportional to the amount of time each user spends on the producer's website.<p>It seems to me that you should separate the explanations for producers and consumers. Consumers probably don't care about how the producers get paid, they just care about what content is available and how much it will cost them a month to access it (yes I realise you're still in the finding the content phase and this may well be your plan, but the site currently has text clearly directed at consumers). Producers on the other hand will want to know in detail how much they can expect to make a month from this service. Also the front page is giving me mixed messages. On the one hand ""Support the sites you depend on, without lifting a finger."", on the other ""Start monetizing your web traffic today. Login"". Sounds like you're talking to two different people there. Should I not login if I just want to access content?<p>The iframes in the examples are pretty horrible, but that's just my opinion.

Most crypto attacks require more cleverness and more sophisticated math than the original algorithm required, a point that is all but spelled out for you in the crypto books when they say ""don't even bother trying to build your own cipher until you've broken several others first"".<p>Or take software. Does anyone actually believe that it was harder to write code for the ActionScript interpreter than it was to get Dowd's exploit (<a href=""http://bit.ly/13OjyR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/13OjyR</a>) working?  Lots of people have written interpreters (even fast threaded stack interpreters). Nobody has written an exploit this sophisticated. And this is just an exploit!

Twitter is wildly popular but it loses money. Could the codgers at software giant Microsoft (a Facebook investor) be the guys who end up figuring out how to make money on social networks?<p>The company on Wednesday will begin testing a new social-networking platform called Microsoft Vine, and chief strategist Craig Mundie tells Fortune the company is planning on pursuing a subscription-based model instead of trying to support the platform only with advertising. Vine's other twist: It plans to target public safety officials and concerned citizens seeking emergency information.<p>""All governments have this issue. Many of them struggle with safety as a problem,"" Mundie says. And he says he is optimistic that Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) can crack the code for making money off social networks. (More on that in a moment.)<p>Think of the platform as the updated version of a 9-1-1 call or the local public radio station. Consumer users of the service can create profiles and make groups ""my family"" or ""my softball team,"" to whom they can send messages. Activity will be limited to two actions: alerts and reports.<p>A tree down in your neighborhood? You could post a report about that. Practice canceled because of the rain? Send an alert to your teammates. And in more serious situations, a flood, say, the site will provide information on how to handle the emergency. Vine will also offer updates from sources such as the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.<p>So far public officials have been reluctant to use social media as a formal way to interact with citizens. Barbara Graff, director of the office of emergency management for the city of Seattle, is willing to test the service with Microsoft, in part because she's eager to get more data and insights into how the city can use these new communications tools.<p>Microsoft says it would make basic service available free, but would charge for premium services, such as access to the platform via smart phone. The world soon will know if consumers are willing to pay for social networking, or if the subscription model is destined to die on the vine. To top of page",1241107806

The exit sum for a founder can be calculated as %ownership X salesprice. So if you add up all the founders that have exited, and see how much money they made on average, and then compensate for the companies that didn't make it you will come up with the average salesprice that a founder will get paid when his copmany is sold. Since YC has a track record by now you can simply do the calculation for YC and your seedfunding outfit of choice and see which gives a better payour for the average founder.<p>There are a lot of nuances of course, maybe there's an extraordinarily large exit, some incubators hold on to companies longer, you can only estimate companies that heve either been sold or gone bust, etc. but it will give a pretty good rough idea.",1241107734

Windows 7 is the best operating system that Microsoft has created since Windows 95, but it breaks the same model that Windows 95 did - and Windows 95 began the cycle that effectively eliminated much of Microsoft's market control. In the end, the next three years will be one for the history books. Those who lose will go  down in infamy for their failures.<p>This battle is for all the marbles and it is particularly interesting that Apple may actually depend on Microsoft's success, because Google plans on taking both out.<p>Building dominance<p>Bill Gates is credited with making that one critical decision that turned Microsoft into the power it became and made him the richest man in the world. He gave away the OS at cost to IBM while retaining the rights. (Clicking on the link will showcase what happened to the guy who actually wrote the OS).<p>Until then, operating systems were largely provided by hardware manufactures and could never reach the level of dominance needed to control a market and the resulting eco system. By ultimately giving the software to IBM initially (while retaining critical rights) and later selling it very cheaply, Gates took control of a market and made money off of the products like Microsoft Office that were built on top of it.<p>In effect, hardware vendors outsourced the operating system to Microsoft who had given them a product that allowed them to compete with each other on hardware prowess (which is what they did best anyway).  An empire was born on one simple OS lesson: Keep it cheap, keep it simple, control the OEMs and own and profit from the applications.<p>Breaking the model<p>Once dominant, and this appears to be a repetitive and common mistake, there was an increasing need to grow the revenue from the OS. Windows 95 was created, doubling the price at a time when hardware cost had dropped by around a third and it started to feel more like a bundle of applications than just an OS, containing the UI, which had previously been a spate addition, media playing capability, several games, basic editors, disk utilities and a browser. Still, there was only one version, it was still relatively cheap (under $100 on top of $2000+ hardware) and, while weakened, it seemed bulletproof.<p>Except Microsoft was so dominant the bundle created anti-competitive problems, first with the U.S. and then with Europe. This got the government involved and, coupled with some other mistakes Microsoft made, caused them to lose their U.S. antitrust trial and put them solidly in the EU's gun sights.<p>Then the OS forked. Windows NT, which had initially been intended for workstations and servers, dropped into the business market creating two versions somewhat incompatible with each other.   They stayed this way until Windows XP and then Microsoft seemed to forget that Windows was an OS and started treating it like an application and the versions started to multiply.<p>With Vista, they blew up the model with two versions for business and four for the consumer topped by Ultimate, which, with hardware cost reductions, actually cost more than some of the hardware in the market at the time it was released. Microsoft Office became decoupled so it no longer helped drive upgrades and, for the first time ever, sales of the previous version of the OS actually increased, Microsoft lost market share, and OEMs started aggressively looking for alternatives. First with Linux and most recently with Android.<p>Microsoft forgot their lesson and Google is moving in for the kill.<p>Android<p>How do you displace Windows? You look for a technology change wave, much like Microsoft did with the PC, and then you use Microsoft's model to do the same thing Microsoft did. The wave is the Cloud and, initially, it is having a bigger effect on smartphones than PCs.<p>Google picked where Microsoft was weakest to attack first (smartphones), built a pool of developers, showcased that their model worked. But Google always planned to displace Microsoft. We'll see the initial moves late this year with the big push starting next year.<p>The Android OS will be very cheap or free to the OEMs, carriers, and cell phone companies that use it.   Google will make money off the applications, services, and advertising revenue that lies on top of this platform they will increasingly own, and, if they are as successful as Microsoft was, they will end up where Microsoft is.<p>Currently. virtually every major OEM is in talks or tests with Android. Each one is increasingly frightened that one will get this right first and steal the market, initially for netbooks and Nettops, but eventually for PCs. It is interesting to note that Google is borrowing from both Apple and Microsoft. They are modeling the user experience from Apple and the economic model is a variant of Microsoft's focused on an on-line application store to bypass retail.",1241107632

Well, as netbook manufactuers continue to find ever more obscure distros to fit onto their systems, Canonical has stepped into the fray wielding a mighty cluestick: Ubuntu Netbook Remix (UNR).<p>When we interviewed Mark Shuttleworth a few weeks ago, he agreed that Ubuntu was late into the netbook arena. But the arrival of Jaunty Jackalope means that UNR has finally seen an official release, so there are lots of questions that need answering: how is it different from normal Ubuntu? How well does it work on average netbooks? And, most importantly, is it any good?<p>If you've already read our group test of netbook distros and want to know what Ubuntu can do to pull ahead ahead of the pack, you can read our full review of Ubuntu 9.04 Netbook Remix below. Read on!<p>Lots of people loved it, just as many hated it, but few can doubt that Asus changed the computing world with the original Eee PC. Suddenly you can could get the functionality of A Real PC out of a laptop you could slip into your bag and still have room for lunch and a good book. Sure, it might have looked like something Toys 'R' Us would produce, but the Eee PC 701 has been followed by dozens of other devices that add more style, more power and more refinement.<p>But, despite having an early lead, Linux managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, and Windows XP has managed to forge a home for itself on netbook devices. In fact, at the computer store nearest to TuxRadar HQ, nearly all the netbooks ship with Windows as standard, and most of them don't have a Linux option.<p>Part of the problem people were facing with Linux was that it simply wasn't Windows - they wanted their Start menu, they wanted My Computer and they wanted Microsoft Office. OpenOffice.org, good as it is, just doesn't cut it if someone is looking for the ribbon toolbar from Office 2007. Another problem was that some of the netbooks were ridiculously oversold. The Eee PC 701, for example, was marketed as being a great laptop for photographers on the move, which is remarkable given that it came with nothing more than mtPaint.<p>But by far the biggest problem with Linux netbooks was that too much stuff just didn't work out of the box. People don't know what codecs are and they don't care. What they want is to be able to double-click on an MP3 and have it play. They want to watch kitten videos on YouTube. Someone called us once because they were having trouble installing Skype on their Acer Aspire One - they were double clicking a setup.exe file and, unsurprisingly, nothing was happening.<p>Thanks to its aggressive marketing, we all know that Ubuntu is ""Linux for human beings"", but can the Wizards of Polish really take the bruised and fragmented Linux market and make it work? Yes, they can.",1241107541

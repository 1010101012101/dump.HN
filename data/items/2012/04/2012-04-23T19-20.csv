But, at the end of the day they are not a software company so in 10 or 20 years you can expect them to be hiring the same consulting company's for internal projects that Lockheed Martin uses.<p>In the consulting world product is irrelevant you serve large organizations and the problems they develop over time.  While they are young Google, Facebook, and SpaceX don't have a lot of the internal cruft that consultants exist to deal with, but I can guarantee they are creating it right now.<p>Amazon EC2 and GMail are probably the best examples of direct completion with traditional consultants by start-ups.

It's extremely easy to hook into EventMachine in Rails, and I encourage you to give it a try if you haven't yet. Even if you're not using Thin, EM can run in a thread and you can use it alongside Rails.<p>As for a source for the ""heavy use in production"" comment, I suppose I can't provide one off the top of my head. However, if you're a Rubyist you know how often Thin is used in production. For a while, it seemed like every deployment guide suggested the use of Thin cluster to run the app.<p>I'm not sure how you reached the conclusion that Sinatra (and thus, Rack apps, including Rails, in general) is difficult to deploy. We have mod_rails which makes it as easy as setting the apache DocumentRoot to your app. If that's not your cup of tea, it's a simple command to start up a cluster of Thin or Unicorn processes, and it's a few lines of nginx configuration to proxy.

3880624,comment,3871463,3871822,2,0,Gormo,,,"Peer-to-peer is only O(n^2) if every node is always connected to every other node.  But Valve's organization seems to work by creating much smaller sub-networks on an ad-hoc basis, so that at any given instant, each node is only actually connected to a small set of other nodes.  Instead of a hierarchical system which would have each sub-network be permanently defined with clear boundaries, and create a network-of-networks to coordinate them, this method ensures coordination among the sub-networks by relying on most nodes being a part of multiple sub-networks and having a slightly different set of connections, such that there's an overall mesh that does actually connect every node in the graph, directly or indirectly.<p>Sort of the way torrents work, in fact: there's a pool of seeds and peers - which might have thousands of members - but your client is only exchanging data with maybe a few dozen at any given time. But since each peer has its own slightly different set of connections, data anywhere in the system can still propagate to the entire system.<p>I suppose it would be an interesting problem to figure out, given n nodes, with each node having a minimum of x and a maximum of y edges per node, and a maximum of z edges per path, what the minumum total set of edges would be to ensure that there exists a path between any two nodes.<p>I think a flat hierarchy necessitates 'adhocracy', but from a cultural and operational standpoint, I'd expect them to mutually reinforce each other quite well.",1335210866

Sure, in the opening paragraph, Jobs tries to pretend he doesn't loathe Adobe [1], but in the rest of it it makes sure to push the idea that Apple is some sort of white knight of open standards fighting the good fight against the visionless Adobe who still doesn't get this thing called Web Standards. For example he writes<p>""HTML5 is completely open and controlled by a standards committee, of which Apple is a member.""<p>Notice it doesn't even mention that Adobe is also a member of the standards committee just like Apple? Or how about this gem:<p>""Apple even creates open standards for the web. For example, Apple began with a small open source project and created WebKit [bla bla bla] Apple has set the standard for mobile web browsers.""<p>You may not know it, but KHTML was pretty competitive, shipping with Konqueror, the default web browser in KDE, and it also had a lot of users including Nokia before Apple forked it and started to add their own code to it, a lot of the times Mac specific and non portable. It also fails to mention that Apple's own contribution to WebKit is far lower than that of KDE's developers, authors of the original codebase and later additions to WebCore like KSVG2, KCanvas, KDOM [2], or Google, the current largest contributor. It's pretty deceiving to claim that Apple just took a ""small open source project"" and gave WebKit to Google, Nokia, Adobe (they use and contribute to WebKit also) etc to use, and it's extremely deceiving considering the bad blood between KDE developers and Apple caused by the way Apple forked KHTML and managed their fork originally ([3] for an episode of that open source drama).<p>Anyway, this letter is just an episode in a long and entertaining grudge match between Jobs and Adobe, dating back to the days when Apple's own survival in the holy war against PC\Microsoft depended on Adobe's commitment to support MacOS, which was apparently not enthusiastic enough by Jobs' standards.<p>[1] Via a review for the recently released Final Cut Pro X, I found this old article about the origins of Final Cut, where Jobs claims<p>""But a 1998 meeting in which Jobs asked Adobe Systems executives to develop a Mac version of their consumer video-editing program changed his mind. ""They said flat-out no,"" Jobs recalls. ""We were shocked, because they had been a big supporter in the early days of the Mac.

Just look at the Wikipedia entry for Adobe Premiere to find out that outside the Jobs distortion field the software was released on Macs from day 1, in fact it was exclusive to Mac for the first versions. By version 3, a less advanced port to Windows is released, and the Mac version continues to be far ahead until... (surprise) 1998 when Mac and Windows versions reach parity and begin being released at the same time. It sure looks like Apple is trying to punish Adobe for giving the Windows peons access to software that was exclusive to Macs until then.<p>[2] <a href=""http://tech.slashdot.org/story/05/07/10/199244/apple-to-adopt-kde4s-kdom-and-ksvg2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.slashdot.org/story/05/07/10/199244/apple-to-adop...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blogs.kde.org/node/1049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.kde.org/node/1049</a>",1335210529

Meanwhile, I'm in my mid-forties and had a company pay to move me cross-country for my technical skills.

The problem of dividing up chunks of memory for application programs to use is as hard as dividing up that hard disk for large and small files to live in, EXCEPT that application programs expect to be handed a chunk of <i>contiguous</i> memory when they call malloc. Hard problem even with the powerful tools that have evolved for solving it over the years.

The ""special"" video card slot throughout history has simply been a higher bandwidth interconnect relative to whatever else was there (well, in the AGP days it also had a primitive IOMMU for doing DMA into userspace).  The integrated graphics on Intel parts, obviously, have the important distinction of sharing the memory controllers (and, I believe, the L3 cache?) with CPU work.  That does hurt things under some loads, though many games are actually quite CPU-light these days.<p>""CUDA"" is an NVIDIA trademark for their compute platform, it's not a special kind of technology.  In fact Intel's i915 derived GPU works very similarly.  In fact, Intel's AVX instructions also work along basically identical lines.  They're all wide SIMD implementations of a bunch of parallel tasks(/threads/lanes/warps, the Industry terminology is a mess).<p>Honestly, I think rwmj is right: for a consumer gaming rig, it <i>would</i> be preferable to have an 8 core part without integrated graphics.  The reasons that isn't going to happen aren't technical though: first, Intel needs to ship different binnings of these same parts into segments (Ultrabooks, tablets) where the graphics are required and where price is more constrained -- basically, they have to make these in large quantities anyway.  Second (and relatedly) they already do make ""lots of cores w/o graphics"" variants, but they sell them into the low volume <i>server</i> market where margins are much higher.

Python, although it can get you closer to single-language scientific computing, can't quite get you there because of the split language model: at the very least, libraries have to be written in C for adequate performance; often complex projects end up requiring parts written in C.<p>Doing practical scientific computing only using code implemented in Julia is completely unrealistic. At the very least, a lot of fast kernels (BLAS, LAPACK, etc.) are going to be implemented in C and/or Fortran for the foreseeable future. What Julia brings to the table is the ability to call C/Fortran libraries <i>without writing anything but Julia code</i>  you can just load a .so file and call functions without compiling anything (see <a href=""http://julialang.org/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julialang.org/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/</a>). If we could have the same level of trivial interoperability with Python, then you could potentially use scientific libraries written in Python, while still only ever writing Julia code. That helps alleviate the ""frankenstein project"" problem without throwing out all the excellent work that's been done by the SciPy community.<p>In the other direction, there are people who already have projects that are all or mostly Python. Forcing them to have some random piece in Julia just to use a nice bit of Julia functionality is making the frankenstein problem worse. If they can trivially call Julia code (perhaps via a .so, as it were just a library written in C), then that's one less frankenstein project in the world.",1335209336

So now, you have a very specific (and obscure) stored procedure, that has to be exposed in <n> layers of application tiers.<p>Now imagine you need sales for an individual customer, but now only for products from a particular manufacturer, and imagine the two ways <i>that</i> could be implemented.

I'm not sure how common this is today, but I was scraping hundreds of commerce sites in 2001, each having several (often 5 but sometimes 50) different product page layouts for different sections, each with its own field names, fields, and crazyness, for a total of a few thousand different ""scraping logics"" (each just 5-10 lines long, but each had to be individually maintained). Now, every day just two (out of a few thousands) broke, but to keep everything robust, you had to (a) be able to tell which one broke, and (b) fix it within a reasonable time frame. Neither of these is simple.<p>- sites that depend nontrivially on JavaScript. That gives you the choice of either (a) reverse engineering the javascript, and making your scraper figure out all the details the same way the javascript would, or (b) use something like phantomjs or e.g. a controlled IE session to let the javascript run and then take the data from the DOM.   (a) is more efficient, more work but was (unexpectedly for me) much more stable. (b) is less work upfront, more maintenance, and a LOT more resource intensive.<p>- sites whose traffic management system you trip while scraping. Many will block you, some actively (with an error message, so you know what is happening), some will just keep you hanging or throttle you down to a few hundred bytes/second all of a sudden, with no explanation and no one to contact. Amazon contacted us when they figured we were scraping (we weren't hiding anything and doing it with a logged in user that had contact details), and were cool about it.<p>- sites that randomly break and stop in the middle of a page. Happens much more than you'd think; When using the site, you just reload or interact with a half-loaded page.

You had people doing it in various scripting languages, C++, Java, whatever.<p>The way I recall (again, having trouble finding this), the team or person/approach that won handily was the one using Unix from the standard commandline interface (e.g. bash) - no scripting or programming at all!  Where instead of writing a program to do it all, the person or group simply used standard Unix tools, piping them together etc, until the problem was solved.

We don't have a ""Unix of the web"" - though, again, AWS and Amazon's ambitions on e.g. payment, database, etc, seem to be vaguely in that direction - which is far more productive than writing a piece of software.<p>No matter how productive -- HOW PRODUCTIVE! - you are at writing a script to bill a user ten dollars, you can never -- NEVER! -- be as fast as typing ""| bill 10.00"" where ""bill"" takes an email address on standard input.  That Unix program does not exist.<p>The way the web is developing, it does not look like it will exist.  This was my point.  I guarantee you that typing ""| bill 10.00"" is nearly ten thousand times as fast as writing any program in any programming language that does that.<p>Unix works because someone took the time to write programs that can be stitched together at the command prompt (or from a script).  The Internet just doesn't work that way.<p>The blog post I'm referring to ends with:
""Is that just the way things must be, that geniuses are in short supply and ordinary intelligence doesnt scale efficiently? How much better could we do with available talent if took a better approach to developing software?""<p>I say, the problem is that the geniuses are no longer creating the ""Unix programs"" of the web.  They are writing software, i.e. lines of code, they are not writing web ""utilities"".<p>If all the geniuses got together and gave me the top thousand things you need an API for, and instead worked on making them a set of small, modular Unix commands, then I would be literally ten thousand times more productive than now.<p>I could literally do in 20 seconds of typing what I can do in two days.",1335207832

It also does not provide any information on the numbers related to the research of the Computer Science Department.  How much money were they bringing in in grants?  How many papers were they writing?  How many students were moving through the department?  If these numbers don't make enough sense, or they don't stack up to other departments when a cut has to be made, then it really just boils down to something like this.<p>It seems completely absurd that a thriving research department would be shuttered because of budget reasons, which is what the Forbes article (and I use that term loosely, ""post"" is probably a better word) seems to imply, and this may be the case, but I'm quite skeptical.<p>Sometimes, if you have a bad set of faculty that create a stagnant department (no research, bad teaching, all tenured, and all resisting hiring good new faculty to maintain the status quo) you have to take dramatic steps to get rid of them so you can trim back on your budget (tenured faculty make a lot more than new faculty) and breath new life into a program.  In some cases, the only option to reboot a department may be to scrap it entirely, offer zombie profs new spots in a similar department, and bin the rest you don't like or offer them much-less-cush teaching jobs where they have to work for dinner.  Later on the department can be restarted and reconstructed from new and preexisting good faculty.  I'm not saying this is the case here.

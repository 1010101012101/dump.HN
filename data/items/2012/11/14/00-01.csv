And yes, I have written a lot of C and lisp and prolog and erlang and ... and I never have problems with the syntax.<p>- If people worry so much about the syntax what happens when they get to the semantics?<p>- Seriously, why would you want to Erlang to have similar syntax to a language with different semantics? In my view that would be asking for trouble. I think one reason why I haven't had trouble with mixing languages is that both the syntax and the semantics are different.

So we've been experimenting with giving more in-depth answers.

This person, after violating our quality guidelines, had done multiple reconsideration requests. His English-language reconsideration request was selected to get a more personalized response, but then when the Googler started to investigate the site, the actual site was in Italian. That's what triggered the ""this language is not supported"" message because the person handling the case was expecting an English-language site based on the English-language reconsideration request.<p>What you need to know:<p>- we absolutely do handle reconsideration requests in lots of different languages, including Italian.<p>- we've also been experimenting with giving more in-depth answers to webmasters. The mismatch between the language of the reconsideration request and the language of the website caused this message to get sent, but<p>- we'll still send this site more in-depth advice.

Absurd because it says something like: ""Ok, we have penalized your site, and we thank you for your reconsideration request. What a pity that we don't understand a heck of italian, so we cannot verify what your are saying us in english about it"".\nSo... Google penalizes a italian site (but maybe happened also to french or polish or other not english ones), but don't process reconsideration requests because that site is in Italian.\nAs I say in my post, that leads to other questions. For instance: if a site is penalized, but the search quality team does not have ""italian"" support, those penalizations sound as if they were simply algorithmic.\nOr, if the site is flagged by italian quality raters (I'm sure they exist), how Google can then penalize a site just based on an human judgement if it cannot after verify the reasons of that penalization have been corrected because they don't support italian?\nAbsurd.",1352851977

What I mean by that is: Common tasks like hashing a password, creating a secure http connection, encrypting plaintext asymmetrically, etc., should be obvious, clear, and as secure as technology allows.<p><i>But</i>, there are so many different crypto libraries with so many varied defaults, that in the end, we need some basic education on what is secure and what isn't.  This particular blog post states in the 3rd sentence that developers using libraries are already making a grave mistake.  How can we know which libraries to trust?  If we can't trust libraries, what <i>can</i> we trust?  Which magic combination of alphabet-soup abbreviations is the most secure, and how can I, a layman, be sure?  For example: For asymmetric encryption, GPG on Ubuntu 12.04 defaults to the CAST5 algorithim.  Is this better or worse than AES-256?  I hear about AES-256 all the time, but I've never heard of CAST5.  How can I, a layman, know it's the best default choice, considering that I only hear about more popular algorithms?<p>I feel like there <i>should be</i> a single best answer for most possible use cases.  For example, today the best answer to storing password hashes would be to use the bcrypt library for your language of choice.  But there's just <i>so many</i> options and <i>so little</i> clarification and consensus to a lot of these things (for regular developers, at least), that it's nigh-impossible to be confident about what you're doing.  People are still MD5'ing passwords to this day--and it's not because they're idiots, because even knowing about MD5 means they had to have the initiative to Google ""how to hash a password"".<p>If I've misread the intention of this blog post, then perhaps I'm arguing the wrong point.

Gates had at least one such meeting with then President-Elect Obama, before it was decided he would remain SecDef in the Obama administration.<p>As for FBI and CIA catching spies, I point to Robert Hanssen, who was brought down by his own arrogance. As ironic as it sounds, he was brought down by a system he devised while working counter-intelligence at the FBI. Hanssen came up with a system for ranking foreign operatives by what they have access to, not by their rank. When they were searching for the KGB mole, they checked who could have accessed the compromised reports. In some cases it was actually a small number of people had the access, including Hanssen.",1352851676

This is also annoying in games, where using your left thumb on a virtual joystick leads to hitting the Back/Home buttons at inopportune times. It seems that moving these controls back to the center forces users to have the intention of navigating through the system, and I have to say that is a pretty good reason.<p>However, I believe that all of these issues could have been solved with palm-detection or simply disabling the buttons when swiping from another part of the screen.",1352851425

While I do believe that study of math improves the ability to analyze problems that have an underlying logical framework, I also think it can be a hindrance in some cases.<p>Something like Foreign Policy involves so much nuance and understanding of History, human and organizational behavior that I think attempting to take a purely analytical approach to solving those problems will fail.<p>You reminded me of something an English professor said to my class decades ago when one of us complained about the amount of Liberal Arts classes we were required to take. As best I can remember it was, &quot;as engineers, your job will be to solve problems, but you need to understand that not all problems can be solved logically.

The BSD changes were theoretically &quot;free&quot;, in that if you had a license from AT&T (which were easy to get, since at the time AT&T couldn&#x27;t sell software), you could do anything you wanted with them.<p>What people did was to fork BSD, take their modifications proprietary, and create Solaris (well, SunOS), HP-UX, AIX, Irix, and a fair-sized stack of others that did even worse in the marketplace. The end result of <i>that</i> was fragmentation in the Unix ecosystem, which was bad on many levels. (One example: Don&#x27;t like autoconf/automake/libtool? Guess where the necessity of those came from?)<p>Or, how about Jordi Gutiérrez Hermoso&#x27;s response to ESR:<p>&quot;The FSF sure can prevent it, and proprietary compilers still thrive. Here is one that particularly bugs me as an Octave developer: we routinely see people being lured to use Nvidia&#x27;s non-free nvcc for GPU computing, which they gleefully admit is based on clang and LLVM. And there is Xcode, of course, completely non-free and completely based on clang and LLVM.<p>&quot;The fact that these non-free tools are not based on gcc are a testament to how proprietary software developers cannot plug into gcc, and how clang is fostering non-free software.<p>&quot;The nvidia situation is particularly dire becuase today, free GPU computing is almost nonexistent. It&#x27;s almost all based on CUDA and nvidia&#x27;s massive pro-CUDA marketing campaign. Even most OpenCL implementations are non-free, and the scant few free implementations of OpenCL that exist are not fully functional.&quot;<p>So we have several examples of ESR&#x27;s approaches <i>failing</i>. On the other hand, the GPL does a pretty successful job of preventing the kind of fragmentation that damages ESR&#x27;s &quot;hacker community&quot;. And part of the reason it does is the FSF&#x27;s dogmatic stance.",1390420313

While yes, there will be impact to jobs and the auto-industry to some extent, but my personal take on this, is the loss will be much less compared to the gain.<p>Airplanes are an interesting example, as they can basically fly themselves by most part, and pilots are often just baby-sitting the machine. Of course the draw back is when the machine fails, they often don&#x27;t have enough training to properly react, but that&#x27;s for another day. If one draws similar parallel, this would indicate that trucking would not be wiped out completely as a profession, but will change into supervising the self-driving truck. Likely, enabling greater loads, faster delivery and therefore setting economics for better pay. (One would hope at least.)<p>The creep-factor of this flier really strikes me as a restraining order-worthy. Since they know where he lives, such a order becomes a viable option.

7104685,comment,7103815,7103815,19,0,cmadan,,,"We at ClinchPad, which also uses a card based layout similar to Trello, faced the same issues. For every 100 cards, it&#x27;d add another 1-2 seconds to the load time meaning when you got to about 700 cards it would be close to 10 seconds of load time.<p>Here&#x27;s how I fixed it<p>1. I added pagination - Load only 300 cards, paginate to load more. We found that while some people had 300+ cards in their default view, most never actually utilised the view usually using a filter to bring down the no of cards to a more manageable level.<p>That still left about 3-6 seconds of page load time for 300 cards. Unacceptable. So these where the further steps I took to fix it.<p>2. The main culprit after some rudimentary profiling seemed to be the jQuery&#x27;s .html(&#x27;&#x27;) tag. Apparently it does some cleanup which takes awhile on a huge DOM block with lots of attached events. Replaced it with by looping through each child node in the DOM block and removing them with removeChild. Achieved 8x speedup, loading time down to 1-2 seconds with 300 cards.<p>3. Second culprit was the jQuery UI&#x27;s droppable and draggable initiations was taking awhile. Hacked around this by putting the jQuery UI&#x27;s droppable and draggable initiations inside a setTimeout thats fired in 100ms. Of course, this doesn&#x27;t affect the actual rendering time but the perceived rendering time is now <1sec because the pipeline loads instantly and it is usually 1-2 seconds before the user does an action on the UI.<p>All in all, just less than <20 lines of code changed but took me two full days to figure it out. At one point, I was looking through jQuery UI&#x27;s droppable code and futility seeing how I could optimize it. :)",1390418114

American politicians love to use &quot;change&quot; as a campaign slogan, e.g. &quot;Time for a change!&quot; (Clinton) and &quot;Change!&quot;, &quot;Hope and Change&quot;, &quot;Change we can believe in!&quot; (Obama).<p>Would you choose a life of contentment or a life of discontent that calls for disruptive change?

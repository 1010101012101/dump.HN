36188,comment,36184,36184,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"""What's missing is the support necessary for large-scale application development.""<p>This is exactly what Google Web Toolkit aims to solve. But its amazingly under-appreciated and I'm still not sure why.. I suspect the learning curve is a put-off to many developers. Or simply b/c it uses Java, that could also be it.<p>""The only way to fix many of these issues would be to strip away the browser, to strip away JavaScript, to change the nature of HTTP and the related conventions.""<p>Supposedly HTML5 aims to do some of this. W3C is reconsidering this new standard to address some of the inherent problems being described.",1185224109

They are terribly unproductive. They write bad code and produce shoddy software, and they threaten their projects by taking giant risks which are completely uncalled for.""<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html</a><p>i agree that you shouldn't be writing three-ring-bound tomes, but spending a few hours planning out exactly what the thing will _do_ (just the 'what'; not even the 'how') usually teases out problems that you'd only find a few weeks into winging it.",1185223501
36182,comment,36087,36087,0,0,Tichy,,,"In ""why is sex fun"" I read that gathering is actually much more efficient than hunting (and people worked an average of 6 hours/day - for the society in that study anyway). One theory then stated that the point of hunting was to be a bigshot now and then, which would enable you to seduce more women. It still seems to be the major motivator for making a career today...",1185223353
36181,comment,36152,36152,0,0,Tichy,,,"Hm, interesting, but slightly weird concept. If the users are willing to vote actively for their favorite ads, why not let them do it on your homepage to begin with?<p>On the other hand, why voting, isn't click/no click sufficient information to judge the effectiveness of ads (seems to work for Google Adwords)?

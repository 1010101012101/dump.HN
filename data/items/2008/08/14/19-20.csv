Thanks to good compilers, though, you don't have to care about the lameness of the instruction set (eg, there are ambiguities in the encoding that need to be disambiguated by register prefixes, there are lots of subtle and pointless variations in the instructions, etc.) Good software lets you pretend that the instruction set you're using isn't actually complete crap.",1218743116

Why are there so many BSD's and why are there even more Linux distros, and why are there so many 'buntus? Well its my opinion that having that many choices is an advantage. I can't stand 90% of the Linux distributions, but some people might think that my choice(Kubuntu) is a bad one, some would say that choosing Linux instead of FreeBSD or OpenBSD is a bad idea. Choice is good, sometimes more choices are confusing, but if you just go for the most popular choices and ignore the less popular ones, its easy to make them. Will we have one unified Unix one day? If it runs gnome i'll switch to vista, no tanks Ubuntu, KDE is MY choice, its good to have one.",1218743000

Oh, right... firsthand experience reading the original article.<p>It's so funny that people can take one or two articles and use them to build a case -- kind of like when DHH found that some successful companies were not run by MBAs and declared that MBAs don't really add much value (paraphrased).<p>Here's the thing: The press prefers to report about things going wrong because that's what people like to read. For example, they'll report about people getting killed in traffic accidents, but they are unlikely to report on how many people didn't get killed on any given day. Should I therefore declare that people shouldn't drive cars and prove my point by linking to two articles about traffic accidents? I'd be laughed at, but then again, I'm not 37Signals.<p>I have firsthand experience with the type of acquisition they are writing about. The experience was amazing! The company worked really hard to make us feel like part of the family, brought their best people in to help us scale everything up (including putting one of their founders on the team), and they drove tons of traffic to our app. Their stock climbed-up 10x over the course of my time there (but cashing out is all about timing, unfortunately), and I now have a network of really great friends in the industry  -- many of which are now running their own successful startups. Ouch, right? I really got burned.<p>I'm just <i>one</i> datapoint but, IMHO, one firsthand datapoint is all it takes to prove that their sweeping generalization isn't really worth paying attention to in this case.",1218741785

276382,comment,276249,276349,0,0,ajross,,,"Honestly, that conventional wisdom is a little hackneyed.<p>I'm not sure most folks would call C ""wonderful"" for low level code. It's warts are well known, and really don't need to be there: the structure syntax is needlessly complicated (. and -> are separate operators for no good reason); the calling conventions are backwards to support a varargs facility that almost no one understands; they underspecified the type conventions, leading to perennial confusion about the sizes of ints and longs or the signedness of char; etc... If you were starting from scratch to write a language to live in the same space, you probably would fix most of those.<p>But conversely, it's not ""atrocious"" for ""application"" code either. Plenty of good software has been and will continue to be written in C. It's probably a poor choice for code that handles mostly string data. It's doesn't have a whole lot of advantages for an architecture with lots of parallelism (i.e. one which doesn't need to worry about single-CPU performance issues).  Since those two criteria generally define ""web development"", you don't see a whole lot of C used for the kind of problems YC startups work on.  Just recognize that those defined a <i>very</i> limited notion of ""application"", and that lots of people in the real world are working on ""applications"" for which C et. al. are very useful, eminently practical languages choices.<p>Really, C is there to abstract the CPU.  If the CPU has an instruction to do something, you'll probably find it as an operator in C.  If it doesn't, you won't.  If your problem is appropriately targetted at that level of abstraction, you'll think C is great.  If it's not, you won't.  I guess that's hardly a surprise.",1218741204

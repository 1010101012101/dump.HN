They let me, as a developer, tell both other developers and the compiler how to use my class in a clean and understandable format. Why do most popular languages not support this?<p>I'm an Objective-C developer at heart, and perhaps shockingly to most Cocoa novices, header files are the norm. My personal coding style involves only putting things that should be public in the header file, and keeping everything that doesn't <i>have</i> to be public in the implementation file. That includes all ivars, all internal methods (hidden inside a class extension in the implementation file). Headers are for public methods, protocols and public constants, typedefs and enums only.<p>Unfortunately, I also do quite a lot of coding in PHP, Ruby and even Java, and (especially when building re-usable libraries) find myself wishing for header files. People have gotten around it by inventing PHPDoc, JavaDoc and so on, using @keywords to awkwardly describe and document their code. But it's still a huge pain to figure out how to use a class, when you have to browse through all the implementation to be able to see the method signatures.

But when you get ready to do anything production-grade, or even find yourself thinking about things like ""how do I ensure all my processes get started before I start trying to send messages"" start learning OTP.  A great tool for generating skeleton OTP applications and helping with a lot of the associated housekeeping is rebar.<p>The book by Martin Logan, mentioned in another comment, is a great primer on OTP once you have the basics of Erlang under your belt.",1314403331

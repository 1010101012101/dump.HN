Nested list comprehension is OK only in most trivial cases. In my opinion, if I see how a person uses list comprehension, I can tell, what kind of person this is.<p>There are people who, for example, do this\n    def all_is_okey_dorey(lst):\n         return all([some_predicate_fn(x) for x in lst])<p>instead of this\n    def all_is_okey_dorey(lst):\n        for x in lst:\n            if not some_predicate_fn(x):\n                return False\n        return True<p>and can live with themselves somehow.<p>Or there are people, who refuse to acknowledge the existence of anything besides Python 3.x and when forced to write in 2.x use list comprehension instead of iterator comprehension.<p>Thing is, the <i>validity</i> of using nested list comprehension depends not on the amount of for loops you have, but on the thing you want to do with the item. If it&#x27;s just selection, then it might be ok. If you want to apply some kind of function to it, then it&#x27;s most probably the case of trying to be too clever.",1405015186

As other people have mentioned, when surge pricing is going into effect, it&#x27;s a signal to drivers that demand is high and supply is low. So they can cancel rides with few repercussions and just take a fare that pays more. It doesn&#x27;t matter that you&#x27;re willing to pay more; you have to book another Uber and hope that the price doesn&#x27;t continue to rise.<p>Uber&#x27;s response would be &quot;so then give the driver a bad rating&quot;. Right.

If you can get the side light blocked out, get it comfortable on your face, let go with your hands, and just relax, it feels like you&#x27;re standing in a completely different room.<p>Input is nigh impossible. They have a magnetic clicker in their design. I reach under the bottom of mine and tap the screen. It&#x27;s kind of weird to see a super large finger come in and poke at an invisible glass wall between me and the thing I&#x27;m trying to touch. Regardless, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the clicker. Touching the contraption cements it into reality. The best effect for me came from letting go. Voice commands coupled with radial heads-up menus are probably the best bet. Perhaps nod-to-confirm, shake-to-cancel could be implemented.<p>The demos that had flat wall surfaces seemed the most convincing. There was a tour of Versailles that at first seemed really bad, while it was still outdoors. Once it got indoors, the photo quality didn&#x27;t actually improve at all, but the notion of the walls really helped sell it. I stood in front of a painting of Marie Antoinette and surprised myself when I tried to step closer, only to bump into a table in meatspace.<p>There was a demo of YouTube where it simulated a large screen TV in front of you, and you peered around the TV to select the video, like they were on shelves 360 degrees around you. That one also worked really well, other than being stuck with someone else&#x27;s selection of videos, it really felt like sitting in front of a big TV in a very dark room.<p>A video from a helicopter flying over the Great Barrier Reef further supported my experience that constrained rooms are better.<p>There were some other things, but not a lot to write home about.

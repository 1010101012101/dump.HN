He let the Clintonites run the show, and of course they dragged him down in the same way they&#x27;ve done his predecessors. He squandered his star-power in the first year (when powerful people were <i>begging</i> to take pictures with him) and that was it. After that, he pretty much ran things as &quot;Clinton III & IV&quot;. In fact, Bill himself is now to Obama&#x27;s left on various issues, at least going by his public statements.<p>This is the problem with voting &quot;the New Man who will clear up Washington&quot;: it rarely ever happens. Because the difference is made every day, inch by inch, by a political machinery built by a number of cadres, and Obama&#x27;s machinery was fundamentally the same as Clinton&#x27;s (and Kerry&#x27;s, i.e. the people complicit in 8 years of GWB regime). In <i>that</i> I hoped he&#x27;d make a difference.

So, you&#x27;ve spawned a successful movement... to evangelize Scientology. Not a success.<p>Also, the word choice was deliberate; every piece of literature you can find on movements throughout history would suggest that there is a strong correlation between success in spreading awareness/change, and having charismatic leadership: a &quot;face&quot; to put to the movement, and a person that could be looked to--either for guidance, or just as a role-model--when one is confused about what the movement should be focusing on. This is important not for any sort of top-down leadership/command role--it&#x27;s not a 1% hegemon--but rather the &quot;face&quot; exists so that new members have someone to base their understanding on what the movement &quot;is for&quot; off of, instead of just looking at what the people around them are doing (usually nothing.)

I place zero value in punditry, especially from main stream media. What I don&#x27;t believe is that some of these complicated models, Silver&#x27;s in particular, are meaningfully superior to predicting the election by trivially applying recent polling data augmenting it perhaps with a simple weighted combination of polls based on recency or sample size.<p>I take as a given that Silver&#x27;s model is better than punditry. I am skeptical that it is better than the trivial model which any undergraduate stats student would cook up.<p>> The problem is, which polling data do you use? They provide a scientific answer to that question. Instead of cherry picking, they use it all, and weight it based on past accuracy and other factors.<p>What I dispute is whether the &quot;other factors&quot;, which is the secret-sauce that allows Silver to give the impression he has a uniquely predictive model, have any real value.<p>Thanks for the Linzer link.

Supreme Commander, Master of Orion 2, Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age (kinda), Mass Effect... Homeworld 2. You could spend - I&#x27;d guess at least a hundred hours or so - playing each of those games to see all their content and play around with all the options they offered you.<p>Story seems to have become a sort of distraction from the things that make a good game. So the story can be told in ten hours - what about the fun potential of the rest of the game? How many times am I going to play the thing? How much enjoyment can I extract?<p>Even RPGs, where a good story is important, most of the time is spent on quests and character interactions and on playing around with equipment and stats and so on. If you&#x27;re just speedrunning an RPG&#x27;s story, it doesn&#x27;t generally take long. It&#x27;s the game around it that takes the time.<p>At the end of the day, I&#x27;m not that interested in being passively entertained with the story. Maybe if the stories were better it would make sense as a form of passive entertainment. But games are like movies these days, and movies these days tend to have stories that aren&#x27;t worth watching. If I wanted a good story, I&#x27;d go read a book or fish out some DVDs or something. I largely buy games for the stuff that goes on around the story, the game part of the thing.<p>Heck, at 3 an hour I could go and sit in a cinema for 10 hours at a comparable cost. 30 is like - I could buy 6+ hours martial arts practice, or go and do some archery, or go canoeing, or buy the materials to make myself a new desk, or.... 30 is not an insignificant amount of resources. It&#x27;s not clear to me that the pay-off even makes sense anymore - though it did for things that you could play with for longer.<p>10 hours strikes me as ... there&#x27;s probably not a lot there to play with. How many toys of any complexity are your bored of a mere 10 hours later? It may be a very polished experience but, how inventive can you be? ...

Its supposedly not really, deep in the decimal points theres a buried power law factor and a buried linear factor at low levels, but close enough to log for all astronomical purposes.  They worked with an astro-biologist per the article; I assume this is the &quot;astro-&quot; portion contribution.<p>Google for astronomical magnitude and there&#x27;s also some interesting quantitative chemical analysis stuff having to do with light adsorption.  In my misbegotten youth I spent a lot of time in a chem lab squirting weird stuff into sample tubes and hovering over an ancient spectrophotometer.  A spectrophotometer is kind of like what an EE would call a RF network analyzer, but for light waves, sort of.  At least that&#x27;s the best EE analogy I can come up with.  Eventually I spent most of my lab time daydreaming about getting home to play with electronics and computers; why was I trying to become a chemist?  It was pretty interesting stuff to experience in retrospect.<p>The visibility is... questionable.  Google for &quot;clear air return&quot; and WSR-88d and stuff like that.  A &quot;decent&quot; wx radar is sensitive enough to get at least some return from turbulence.  How do you know its not just ground clutter?  Because the doppler shift matches the direction and speed (more or less) of ground instruments.  The questionable bit is clear air return is a bazzilion dB reflection loss below actual real reflectors so it would be incredibly faint compared to actual reflectors.<p>Also the humorous artistic waves don&#x27;t show multipath like real waves.  Not unusual in an urban environment to end up multipath limited not raw sig strength limited, at least in other applications; donno if wifi is usually limited like that.",1374585432

3. Reusable styles - save a style, apply it anywhere, edit it in one spot you get the idea.
4. UI Kits - load in the wireframing kit to easily drag and drop flexible components to design with. Those components can then be morphed into other elements so you don&#x27;t have to throw away your wireframes.
5. Multiple pages - comes in really handy with components. save a header, apply it to multiple pages and manage it in one spot.
6. Interactivity - add an interaction class to an element and Macaw will auto-generate variables needed for interactivity.
7. Style guides - Macaw will abstract all the useful bits of your document (grids, swatches, components, etc) and generate a style guide for quick access to the styles.<p>and more :)<p>We&#x27;re not sure what we&#x27;ll charge just yet, but it will be a fixed price.",1374585201

There are some areas where it's rough around the edges, but overall I love the UI every bit as much as I thought I would. The hardware is actually pretty decent, heavier than the iPad, but still comfortable. I can already tell, though, that the screen will not be near as scratch-proof as the iPad's.<p>The loss of webOS is a damn shame. Best case scenario, it becomes the Amiga of the tablet world, with die-hard fans keeping it clinging to life with hacks and homebrews.",1313902684

I say adopt 2 or more senses of self, and get really good at using them at the right time.<p>I think moving beyond an ego-based sense of self is the best way to think rationally and accomplish a goal.  In fact, the biggest benefit is probably being able to rationally understand other people's point of view without a sense of self clouding up your interpretation. But, for me at least, it has not been pragmatic to abandon a sense of self at all times.<p>For instance, it is much easier for me to relate to my grandmother with a stronger sense of self - or at least project a persona that gives that appearance.  You can't really like people or things (in the most basis sense) without ego.  Nor, can you fully extend emotional empathy in the purist sense when you have no sense of self.  With no ego there are many professional environments that will simply drain your energy - even if you have a decent persona for relating emotionally with others.<p>For me, the better answer has been to look at my self (more specifically my brain) as a library of different selfs.  Yes, I am nothing, but I must at least be a controller that responds to my environment with the most relevant sense of self at any point in time.  I would suggest there is an evolution of self beyond nothing.",1313902347

2908490,comment,2907623,2907623,1,0,thristian,,,"It sounds like there's two main use-cases here:<p>- Infinite dragging of a particular element; for example, scrolling in Google Maps or the sort of 'click and drag' UI of a typical billiards or mini-golf game.<p>- Relative movement events in general, as used for 'mouse-look' in FPS games.<p>For the first use-case, it should be pretty easy to deal with. Add a property to the 'mousedown' event called 'relativeMode' (or whatever), initially set to false. If the event-handler sets 'relativeMode' to true, then instead of sending the usual string of 'mousemove' events to elements the cursor moves over, the browser should capture (""freeze"") the mouse, hide the cursor, and deliver 'mousedelta' events to the original element (whose x and y properties contain the movement delta from the location of the original mousedown event). When the user lets go of the mouse button, the browser releases the capture and shows the cursor. There's no security issue, because the user is in control of the capture at all times, and can just release the mouse button whenever they want.<p>The second use-case is a bit more troublesome,  but as the Chrome bug linked elsewhere in this thread mentions, ""web-pages in full-screen mode effectively own the cursor anyway"". Perhaps a similar 'relativeMode' property could be added to the 'fullscreen' event.",1313899868

I've realised I need to ship and I've already been talking to customers. I showed them the initial crappy product and understood their market a little from their product.<p>Stories like this really highlight the need to ship immediately, the need to talk to customers and test the validity of the idea as soon as possible.<p>Thank you so much for this.<p>Also the guys with a family who start companies are the ones with the biggest balls in SV. Kudos. You took your fear and charged right at it. I admire that!",1313899384

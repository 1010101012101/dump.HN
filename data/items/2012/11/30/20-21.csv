Economies of scale are going to come into play in an industry like that, and the ability to harvest more concentrated energy with mostly in-situ resources could be a big advantage.

The only thing my parents cared about when I chose my college and major was, ""What kind of job can you get with that degree?"" I was on good terms with the faculty and staff of my major and they felt compelled to acknowledge that most people worry about having a job when they leave school and thus, that faculty and staff felt obligated to explain the marketability of their taught skills, even if they had to go digging and networking with employers to find such answers.<p>You claim that, in the US, we have been experimenting for 150 years, but you only provide as an example your own, personal anecdotal experience as someone who has become a co-founding entrepreneur. You don't even provide UChicago's answer (which, had you done so, would have been an invitation for other alumni to disagree with you).<p>I don't see any meaningful experimentation happening.

It's true that more people are going to college than ever before and tuition has never been higher.  But that only means that college degrees have perceived value, and not necessarily value that comes from their contribution to the productivity of society.<p>The benefits of a degree to employability are obvious, but for a lot of students the benefit to one's knowledge and skills are dubious (e.g. low-quality undergrad business programs).  The cost of college, on the other hand, and the opportunity cost of four years of lost productivity, is huge.<p>If you run a university, this is a scary position to be in - bubbles can end quickly.

(Instead, generation numbers are currently being computed by scanning through history; luckily, they are only needed in some merge scenarios so it's not too bad)<p>2) Add support for ""chunked files"" - a file that is represented as a text file of chunk ids (like a directory, sans the file names); to get the file contents, you recursively unpack each file, and concatenate them.<p>bup does (2) ""artificially"" without notifying git. As a result, it can quickly and efficiently handle small changes to a 100GB file. It's a shame that git can't do that - the rebuilding of such files need to be in the core, but their encoding can be left to a bup style extension (and different break algorithms may match different usage scenarios)<p>With (2), you'd be able to ""git add"" your 30GB virtual machine file to your git repository, and version it.

4855183,comment,4853509,4854211,2,0,tikhonj,,,"Is this really an ""induction-style"" algorithm? (I haven't actually heard that term before.) I usually associate induction with taking some large input and shrinking it at each step until you hit some base case. This is really the opposite of induction--it starts with a base case (1) and <i>grows</i> the output, which makes this sound a bit more like co-induction.<p>Another way to think about it would be that he defined a little finite-state automaton to compute the answer. You just run the automaton for as many steps as you want, noting down what it outputs each time. I think this is actually very much like what a programmer would write if tasked with solving FizzBuzz in an online streaming fashion (rather than for some bounded n).<p>Maybe it's just my bias towards functional programming showing, but I actually think this approach is fairly intuitive. In fact, I would have probably come up with something structurally similar (differing only in details).",1354306186

A lot of the pricing being thrown around here is for internal drives. Regular price on the drive I spec'd was $180. There are always deals to be had though. The price may be more depending on your timing.<p>The case I spec'd is extremely DIY as well. If you went with something nicer, you'd spend more as well. It's kind of hard to justify a crappy case when you're comparing to a Time Capsule.<p>So if you add in $20 for a HDD price not-so-on-sale and $10 for a nicer case (Adafruit is decent), you're looking at $196, which is edging up toward the cost of a Time Capsule, and that's not factoring in time for configuration.<p>The whole point here is that you don't do projects like this to save money.

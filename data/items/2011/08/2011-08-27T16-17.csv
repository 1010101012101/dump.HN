2931872,comment,2931317,2931753,6,0,jeffdavis,,,"Your analysis leaves out a very important factor: rents. If you don't buy a home, you have to rent.<p>If your mortgage payment is below the going rents (not too difficult to achieve if you factor in the tax write-off), then one way you can look at that is you give an $X down payment now for a free house in 30 years. If you look at it that way, slow growth doesn't look quite so bad -- the <i>house</i> only needs to be worth about $8X the <i>down payment</i> in constant dollars 30 years from now. Assuming 20% down, that's only appreciating 60% in 30 years, which is only assuming about 1.5% growth in home value per year.<p>Inflation should probably also factor into your analysis, for those who believe that inflation is likely in the long term.<p>Buying a home also offers a lot of stability on your long-term housing costs. Even if you buy and sell every few years anyway[1], the fact that you are both buying and selling at the same time leads to a fairly even end result. With renting, you are always purchasing on the spot market[2]. Avoiding risk and having control over when you move both have a value.<p>[1] Of course, buying and selling every few years is very costly, but it doesn't affect the stability argument.<p>[2] And it's not just luck when you happen to be moving around. If you are buying into an area because of a new employer, there's a good chance that the employer is hiring, and that a lot of people want that same apartment.",1314463972

On one side, you have passionate Rubyists going on and on about how Ruby, Gems, etc are all so great. The same for Python and Node.js. These guys also code in their spare time and are active on GitHub. On the other side, you have the stereotypical .NET programmer who only codes from 9-5 making boring ""enterprise"" LOB software and only uses technology from MS. You know them, the programmers who only started using jQuery because it now comes bundled with ASP.NET. Programmers who probably can't even create a .NET project from scratch and build on the command line, but rely on the voodoo magic of File->New->Project and Build->Build Solution (F6) in Visual Studio. Does MS really want to woo these developers? </i><p>It is not impossible to be creative using the .Net stack:
<a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/blog</a><p>From this post I gauge that you're approaching .Net from a overly webbish perspective. .Net is more than that. From a computer science perspective, it is so beautiful, Linq is so sweet - I feel like hitting Java with a stick now.<p>Also, here is what you can do with the .Net stack:<p>-> Netduino (using the .Net micro framework)
-> Apps on win
-> A full-feature ML dialect with a very solid vm.
-> Script# is a c# to js compiler so you can create js in vs.
-> WP7
-> Robotics studio<p>Also, express editions of VS are free. You don't need to shell out $550 if  you want to get started coding - this is a myth that IMO needs a solid myth-busting.<p>Also, the lineup of badass devices that you can code for using this stack is bigger than anything out on the market - Kinect for instance - nobody even in the near future can potentially produce a competing device and if you want to base a startup around ruling the living room, I think the kinect should factor in - everyone I see using it is blown away when they are able to say ""xbox pause"" and get their netflix to pause.<p>Edit : formatting",1314463879

The idea that we have too many software engineers however, seems false to me.  Also the idea that everyone needs to orient their career to serve a larger societal good sounds like a prescription of goal oriented blindness.  There are plenty of inventions made for amusement that lead to larger societal good.  If someone feels passionate about aligning their life and career with larger overall goals, that's great. However if someone working at Zygna is passionate about games, perhaps they have an insight you don't and their contribution will make a bigger difference to the world you think.

There's much more to learn about your space than you probably think and they've already been in the trenches and might have gone through some pain points you can skip.<p>Location: If they're national, I'd focus on being local. Look at the way Yelp did things in taking on Zagat, Citysearch, etc by focusing on a core market to build that strong loyal set of powerusers that on average were way more engaged (# of reviews per reviewer).<p>Lastly, I'd consider trying to figure out the competitors cost model. A lot of times many startups that are well funded get that larger funding round because they're looking to scale which means they're spending extra on marketing or sales. Some startups as such are focused on ramping up a sales team. If that's the case, you'll lose playing the game the way they're playing it (ie: groupon vs a local copycat clone since it might work locally but u'll never scale). Try to figure out different methods to do this, price model, sales model, marketing model (guerilla marketing vs traditional marketing), or whatever that will make you more unique and more cost-effective.

The Sun one is just a bit faster and more polished. In other words: this doesn't really affect the kind of end-users that would be affected by a missing installer for Flash. Oracle is just creating a nuisance for system administrators and developers in a market that Linux is already dominating: servers. These users know how to install the Oracle packages outside of the package system and understand the licensing issue.<p>The problem here is not GNU/Linux, but Oracle playing politics (again). The result is that they will continue to alienate developers, while their cash cow won't suffer in the short term (hackers aren't responsible for the majority of their business, business-type decision makers are). The decision to focus on an open alternative instead of working around Oracle's antics is what makes GNU/Linux what it is. GNU/Linux isn't just a practical piece of software, but also an idea. That being said, focussing developer time on the OpenJDK seems like a pragmatic move from a practical point of view as well, because licensing reasons are not something you can just ignore when convenient (without exposing your users to a possible lawsuit from Oracle).",1314462209

It also helps if the business is high margin.  These businesses tend to have high fixed costs too.<p>We recently used Groupon for a midweek booking of a fantastic bed and breakfast.  Great for them - we'd have never heard of it, and the revenue was largely incremental, while the costs were fixed.  Great for us - a B&B when we wanted.  Also great for a bespoke suit.  ($3000 - a little crazy.  But $600 - not so bad)<p>Yoga seems much more variable cost.  A big part of the cost is the teacher.  Some back of the napkin (streetfighting?) math suggests a class of 15 people pays $8 per a hour class.    Counting prep, set up, and tear down, it takes the teacher an hour and a half.  So let's say they make 60.  Then it's 60 to pay for the space, AC, etc.  Very low margin business.  Cutting the revenue by 75% doesn't make sense unless you're selling a lot of add-ons or expecting to convert for long term customers.  Both are risky propositions at best.",1314461190

Installing sun-java6-jdk sure made things easier but I guess I'll have to learn how to do it by hand now, just like I do with all the other Java-related software I use on Ubuntu every day.",1314460893

The Sun packages don't just have performance improvements, but the Clojure devs seem to be actively targeting them. Even if this might lead to improvements to the OpenJDK in the long term it is one hell of a nuisance to have to go around the operating system package management scheme for Java. The lesson is to actively mistrust Oracle and invest more time in solutions that are independent from that company.",1314460887

""No, we're just going to take this opportunity to make our own open source project better.""<p>This sort of crap is why Linux is NOT ready for prime time.",1314460861

Testing is more stable than Unstable, which is more stable than Experimental. Furthermore, Ubuntu does extremely heavy modification to the Debian base, repackaging quite a number of it's core packages, and replacing a number of central parts at times (eg, the boot system).<p>If you're going to say that people don't know what they're talking about, please make sure you do.",1314460855

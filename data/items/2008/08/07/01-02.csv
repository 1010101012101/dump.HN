269264,comment,269151,269152,0,0,wallflower,,,"On the agile projects I have worked on, you had to micro-manage yourself by updating a burndown daily (a spreadsheet of granular tasks and hours). I could see you making developers happier (and selling to Agile shops) if you could somehow automatically update a burndown sheet for them (based on their tasks). Managers love agile because it delegates accountability; developers hate it for the same reasons.",1218074011

At Yahoo flights are often booked at the last minute, people often get rental cars when travelling, etc. I doubt that anyone has a full grasp of the real cost of carbon in the company, let alone an external organisation charged with offsetting for us.",1218073939

There's nothing that matters like the ability to produce and having people work for you on contract is the best way to test that.<p>The test-type questions I've seen have been almost entirely useless. When I'm asking questions now I mostly ask what about someone's goals and what I'm judging is whether I have a company and position that can meet those goals.",1218073738

If the site owns the material using a single user contribution might be fair use within the context of the whole site. If the users own the content you are likely to be using all their content, thereby not able to use fair use.<p>Again all of these are my observations. Hopefully it will give you something to think about. If you are starting a business based on this, you do need to consult a lawyer. Also starting a business based on page scraping is a pretty risky thing to do. If the scraped site turn you off you could be pretty screwed.",1218073576

I've put together a list of questions and talking points that I want to cover during the interview, but it's difficult to assess whether or not they are sufficient.<p>Can anyone recommend good reading material on proper interviewing processes?

I've been using this technique ever since stumbling across it in ""Building Communities with Software"" by Joel Spolsky (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswithSo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswi...</a>).  Money quote:<p><i>Q. Why don't you have some kind of system so I can see what posts I've already read?<p>A. We have the best system that can be implemented in a distributed, scalable fashion: we let everyone's browser keep track of it. Web browsers will change the color of the links you've already visited from blue to purple. So all we have to do is subtly change the URL for each topic to include the number of replies available; that way when there are additional replies the post will appear in the ""unread"" color again.<p>Anything more elaborate than this would be harder to build and would needlessly complicate the UI.</i>",1218071396

If we take the mobile phone industry as a guide, the carriers will probably pay up to about $150 - $250 to get you on a $30 - $50 p/m plan. That doesn't make too much dent in an Air.<p>If you bundle it with home broadband plan (maybe they'd subsidise $300) they could give out mini laptops for free or at $100 or so. \nApple is actually in a spot. Experience & connections with carriers that no one else has, but no product to which a few 100s makes much of a difference.",1218071248

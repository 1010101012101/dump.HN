So if a pretty girl is more used to guys being shy or creepy and you deliver the line in question, which way do you think she's more likely to interpret the approach? You then go on to say that in any case, the chances of coming off as creepy while using such a line are pretty high.<p><i>Sexual intent, confidence and the perception that you're very successful with women and don't need to by shy about what you're after means far more than looks.</i><p>Well that really depends on how ugly you are, doesn't it. :) If you're average to good looking, then yeah I can see (and have personally seen) how attitude makes a difference.

It seems pretty self evident in my mind that no matter how the line in question is delivered, there will be girls who respond positively and girls who do not. The point I'm trying to make is that it's more about the girl than it is the opening line. How inebriated the girl is would make a large difference to the outcome of the interaction and at the risk of repeating myself, in my experience the girls who would respond positively to that line generally are not the ones I've wanted to sleep with.<p>It's another thing entirely if we're talking about using this line or something similar on a woman who you've know for a while and who has had a chance to get used to your personality and sense of humour. I think there might be a far greater chance of a positive response from a ""quality girl"" in this case.

However, while identification is based on finding things outside of the ""Normal"" range, fighting it is all about signatures.<p>Vaccination works by preparing the body to fight something that looks like X by dumping millions of copy of something that looks like X into your body.  At which point your immune system feels it needs to really fight X with everything it has so it develops a specific response.  aka <i>Adaptive immunity is triggered in vertebrates when a pathogen evades the innate immune system and generates a threshold level of antigen.</i> SEE: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system</a><p>This is also why you can have auto immune diseases, if you trip the ""fight"" response to something that should be left along you get a world of problems.  You immune system is more than willing to kill cancer, or even normal cells, and inflammation can be vary harmful.",1268870864

A fundamentally cheaper way in this case is selling Airfoil -- their marginal cost is $0.  They can be more profitable selling Airfoil for $10 than you would be selling AlmostSonosLite for $200.<p>The other problem is user adoption and marketing -- the set of potential users for this is pretty small, relative to the overall consumer electronics market.  Convincing people they actually need this is going to be very hard.  The main use cases I see for wireless speakers are wireless rears in an HT system to avoid running cable, and temporary setups in large spaces (like at a party outdoors).<p>The core Sonos use case, listening to a central repository of music or HT audio in multiple rooms, seems rather specialized, and a lot of the potential customers would value the higher audio quality and polish of the sonos system enough to pay for it.  If you're not going to put good speakers + amp in each room, having a good quality portable system (like a dock for an ipod) seems like the standard solution.<p>The biggest indicator that this is a soft market is that Sonos hasn't sold a huge volume in 6 years, even adjusting huge volume for their pricing being kind of high.",1268870686

Like very few writers - Ebert has a rare gift of making people write back to express themselves. Everyone has personal stories. Reading through the hundreds of responses, Ebert has made them happier by letting them express them.<p>Two comments stood out.<p>""Let me share my favourite guidance from Dr. Daisaku Ikeda, my mentor in life:\n""Life is the accumulation of all the moments we live. One who cannot live meaningfully today cannot hope to lead a brilliant life tomorrow. No matter what grand plans one makes, if he does not value each moment, they will be just so many castles in the air. All the causes in the past and all the effects in the future are condensed within the present moment of life. Whether or not we improve our state of life at this moment will determine whether we can expiate the evils we have caused since the infinite past and be able to build up good fortune to remain for all eternity. The key is whether or not we have faith strong enough to decide that this may be the last moment of our life. The above passage, therefore, gives us the principle for changing our karma.""<p>Two:<p>""Here is an homage to the passionate kiss, in a poem by a romanian poet, Nichita Stănescu - ""They kiss"".

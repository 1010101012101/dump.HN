I won't stretch it too much if by saying that some of the best classical pieces are piano and violin concertos. At least 7 years of piano education were almost unavoidable growing up in former Soviet Union as well. There were free music lessons for everyone. Most people never touched the instrument after they were done. However some ended up switching to guitar or being able to play piano/keyboard for friends' entertainment. So overall I am glad I grew up in a country where music education was so universal.",1289552254

The little town (population 6,000) didn't see too many people move in or out, and there were grudges festering left and right, and there were fights all the time.<p>This is purely anecdotal and based on what I saw and did, but in an environment like that, it seems to me that escalation is only a problem if you don't escalate quickly enough.  If I ended up in a fight (and I probably could have resolved a lot of conflicts without fighting, but I had that perfect combination of arrogance and insecurity that plagues the teenage mind), the problems continued only if I lost easily.  Some of the best advice my mother gave me was ""You can at least get a sandwich if they got a meal.""  (Other hits from mom:  ""The secret ingredient is always more butter.""  A stout lady, most of her advice was either directly about food or used a food analogy.)  If I won, or if I managed to hit hard enough in the process of losing, I'd get no more trouble, except in one pathological case.  Being unskilled but kind of big, I was often able to hit hard enough; if I have anything to say about it, my kids are going to log plenty of hours in a boxing gym.<p>> unless he pulls a knife\nI carry a knife nowadays, after being in enough situations that came close enough to turning ugly that I wished I had one.  I think, on general principal, that it's good for everyone to carry a weapon.  A distant relative of mine who was born in the town we moved to had told me that when he was younger, in the 1940s and '50s, everyone had a gun in their jacket, ""and you could tip your hat and be polite, or take turns shooting at each other.""  There's something to that, I think, in adult society.  If there are no easy targets, if anyone you try to mug/terrorize/rape/attack/etc. can potentially end your life, then society is its own deterrent to crime.  There are always irrational actors, of course, but if the crazy guy has a weapon, I want a weapon, too.",1289551880

1896979,comment,1896643,1896932,0,0,acqq,,,"Kids these days. I guess the OP didn't really understand everything or didn't bother to explain, especially my favorite bit about ""computed goto"" and the fact that if you code your compiler to emit assembly instructions with labels it's quite ""natural"" to implement it.<p>Duff's device is an example of the ""loop unwinding."" Say you have n divisible by 8, then you can loop n / 8 times and have eight assignments in the loop stated explicitly. Now instead executing n assignments and n looping instructions (there can be more instructions needed for one loop and the cost of jump can also be visible) you can have less, n / 8 looping instructions and still n assignments.<p>When such thing should be done? 1) If you measured your loop and it was too slow with a one assignment and one loop pass for every n. 2)  you know that your compiler can't do the loop unwinding automatically -- modern compilers can do such things even if you write a normal loop if the compiler estimates that this can really help and when you give to it a specific direction to produce such code (e.g. aggressively optimize for speed).<p>Only now comes the reason for using Duff's device: how to code the case where n is not divisible by 8? Well you can have a loop for the remaining number R of elements, but then you have R assignments and R looping instructions. More clever thing is to have the sequence of the assignments in the code stream, one after another and to <i>jump</i> directly inside to execute exactly R assignments.<p>Turns out, C was made in seventies, but Fortran was made in fifties and already had the construct which allowed exactly that, the direct jump. So authors of C created something smarter -- a switch statement was implemented so that it compiles to the series of if ... goto or even to the ""computed goto"" sequence, not needing to do more comparisons if the values for jump conditions are one after another.<p>So now we're able to have one sequence for a direct jump (say 8 assignments in a switch) and one sequence for unwound loop (loop around 8 assignments). But why not trying combining them? That was Duff's insight, and the Duff's device is a result of it. The benefit: instead having 16 assignments in the generated code, you'll have just 8 which are going to be used both for R assignments and for unwound loop.<p>Just that last step (reducing the number of the assignments in the resulting code from 16 to 8) is something that you probably won't measure as a direct speed benefit, you'll only have a bit smaller resulting code. So I guess it was more a curiosity than something that must have been done exactly so even as it was written. Still it nicely demonstrates how people who know what is produced by the compiler are able to think, on one side, and how C can be used for ""assembly level"" optimizations, on another.",1289550669

It's common for a 2400+ player not to have an IM title.<p>To get the titles special tournaments are often set up designed to give the players a chance to get a norm if they do well. If you let any low rated players in, it lowers your chances a lot. It doesn't matter if you win 100% of the time against the lower players, it still prevents you from getting a title because chess ""performance ratings"" are calculated by an average of your opponent's ratings (modified +400 if you beat them and -400 if you lost).<p>Also, ratings are not a linear thing. Going from 1500 to 2000 is WAY easier than going from 2400 to 2500.

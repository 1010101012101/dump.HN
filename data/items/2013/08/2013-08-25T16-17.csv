6272619,comment,6271853,6272186,1,0,rayiner,,,">  but I think the whole legal system is so horribly behind technology advances in general<p>I don&#x27;t think the legal system is &quot;behind technology advances&quot; at least usually. I think the reason technologists think that is because they see technology as unprecedented and game-changing (and all those buzz-words). As a result, they think that technology should get special treatment, instead of being analogized to existing practices and concepts.<p>That&#x27;s certainly a reasonable way to approach things, but it&#x27;s a liberal interpretive doctrine. But, right now we&#x27;re in the midst of a multi-decade conservative trend in the judiciary. The conservative concept is that there is nothing new under the sun, and even though things change, they can be tied back to enduring principles and basic concepts.<p>My read is that the judiciary doesn&#x27;t really fail to understand technology. Judges are smart people. People explain all sorts of complex things to them all the time. Explaining most technology is far simpler than explaining, for example, the complexities of a reinsurance agreement between commercial parties. Rather, the judiciary has consciously adopted the conservative tack of not treating technology specially.<p>So in the cell phone context, it&#x27;s not that judges don&#x27;t understand that you can store all sorts of things on your cell phone. They have kids, they know what people store on their cell phones. Rather, they look at the underlying principles behind the rule: the potential for a suspect to destroy evidence in his possession. Well, that potential exists whether we&#x27;re talking about a cell phone or a day planner. I.e. you can tie the technology back to a timeless concept (people write down their schedules and a suspect might destroy those notes if arrested). That&#x27;s not a failure to appreciate the advances of technology--it&#x27;s a conscious decision not to treat technology differently than existing things.",1377449420

6272610,comment,6271292,6271292,14,0,adambratt,,,"While there have been some good points brought up here, I think the author misunderstands what the purpose of Facebook is.<p>Facebook is not in the same category as Reddit. Social network used to be a very specific category of website, now almost every consumer facing website is a social network. Reddit is a content creation and discussion community, basically a centralized version of the forums and bulletin boards of yesteryear. Facebook is a photo, link, and life sharing network.<p>If I&#x27;m sharing pictures of my family and friends, I&#x27;m giving up anonymity by default. The whole point of Facebook is to give an online pin board of what is going on in my life, who I am as a person, and what I think and I enjoy. It&#x27;s the online identity of my human self.<p>Reddit is an open platform for all types of discussion and interaction at a macro scale. What happens on Reddit will rarely if ever affect my actual day to day life. The phrase &quot;hive mind&quot; is all too true when you consider the mass amount of meaningless content there is. It&#x27;s the brain vomit of millions of people and that&#x27;s what makes it awesome and interesting. For every thought or idea I have, I can find someone else who agrees with me and someone who doesn&#x27;t.<p>Saying Facebook should learn from Reddit doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me. Reddit not a new concept or idea. Historically, social interaction online had always been &quot;anonymous&quot; in one form or another. Facebook was the first truly successful community that did away with usernames and forced people to use their real names. To get a billion people to do that is an incredible feat.<p>In my humble opinion, Reddit is not revolutionary at all. The &quot;moat&quot; around the site/business is not near as big as Facebooks. All it would take for a Reddit killer to emerge is for a site to hit critical mass in terms of content and provide a better more targeted form of curation to the user than subreddits and karma. In contrary, Facebook has built a massive moat. Your friend list, your photo history, your about page, your Facebook connected sites and apps...this is a huge fucking moat. I&#x27;m not saying it would be easy for a Reddit killer to surface, I&#x27;m just pointing out that it&#x27;s more likely than a Facebook killer.<p>I think it&#x27;s important for us to recognize that Reddit&#x27;s social network is not Twitter&#x27;s social network which is not Facebook&#x27;s social network and  to understand this when making comparisons between them.",1377449335

The general recommendation was to not try to outsmart the compiler.  Write everything as straight-forward as possible.  Just watch out for work done on values that influence the result but aren&#x27;t really necessary (ex: multiplying by an input that will always be 1).<p>There were several occasions where I&#x27;d write out some elegant math and think &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s pretty.  But, it would run 30% faster if I transposed everything.  But, then I&#x27;d have to hand-interleave the internals of all these functions...&quot;  Then I&#x27;d check the assembly output and Bam! the compiler was already producing exactly what I had in mind!<p>The downside was that it took several minutes to compile <100 line sources that produce <1000 instruction programs.  That&#x27;s with a language completely specialized around small-scale linear algebra that maps very directly to hardware that is completely specialized around small-scale linear algebra; with branching highly discouraged, all functions calls expected to inline away completely, no recursion, no pointers, no heap, no imports, tiny-if-any headers and a tiny standard lib.<p>It&#x27;s my understanding that most of the smartness of the 360&#x27;s HLSL compiler came from using O(n^3) analysis algorithms that were simply impractical at a larger scale.  Our game had thousands of shader programs that were mechanically specialized for different situations.  As a result, recompiling all of them after changing the tiny shared header took many hours.  &quot;Thankfully&quot; the C++ of the game took so long to compile that we were already using Xoreax Incredibuild to distribute the compilation.  We adapted that setup to distribute shader compilation and brought the turn-around time down to 15 minutes by leaching cycles from several dozen of my co-workers&#x27; machines.",1377449284

Lots of people cargo-cult it and themselves don&#x27;t understand it, which turns people off.<p>However, it focuses very much on the principles of programming from a high-level, and has challenging exercises that keep you engaged. It&#x27;s a programming book written from a Computer Science perspective. It uses Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, which frustrates some. However, I think Scheme works best for the book, and replacing Scheme with something &quot;useful&quot; like Python would be the equivalent of taking a linguistics course that uses Latin as a generic vehicle to explain various grammatical constructs, and suddenly replacing Latin with Latin American Spanish - sure, Latin isn&#x27;t &quot;practical&quot;, but that&#x27;s not the point.<p>I did not read it knowing &quot;nothing&quot;, as some people suggest you should. I already knew how to get around in C++ and Python, and then read it on my own.<p>You don&#x27;t really get Concrete Skill X from reading the book (and working through the exercises). It&#x27;s a high-level work. What I got from it was a high-level perspective on languages, algorithms and abstraction techniques. I learned to see imperative, OO, functional and other programming paradigms as tools in a toolbox that have advantages and disadvantages, not as the One True Way to program. I also learned to, in general, think about the literal and not-so-literal implications of my code. The latter half of the book is more about language implementation, and culminates in implementing Scheme, among other things.<p>MIT phased out the book in its introductory course because, &quot;Understanding the principles is not essential for an introduction to the subject matter anymore.&quot; Take from that what you will.",1377449021

I feel the designer&#x27;s pain but public humiliation is not the answer. I think this also gives new or future freelancers/entrepreneurs the wrong idea. This happens rarely. If it happens too often, then it&#x27;s probably your fault as much as the client&#x27;s.<p>I ran a web shop for small businesses ($500K - $10M/yr revenues) in NYC for about 8 years with many clients (good and bad) and faced non-payment issues only a handful of times. Here is my take on it:<p>- Always get enough money from the client to cover your break even hourly rate for the entire project. Don&#x27;t do payment terms without a deposit - unless it&#x27;s a seemingly great client and your cash flow positive.<p>- Keep your margins healthy. The tighter the margins, the harder it is to be civil when these situations come up.<p>- When a customer does not pay, I give them more time and payment options first. I have even gone as far as extending more services to clients I believe are good people on credit if the issue has to do with business being slow. This has built some great long term clients.<p>- 99.9% of the time, if your work causes a positive effect on someones business, they will always pay and never let you go. (They may not show it, but prompt payment and consistent work is the stamp of approval)<p>- When a client does not pay and you have exhausted your process of collections, I put their old site up. If they did not have a site before, I put up a splash page with logo, phone numbers and contact form. Simple and classy. It takes 5 minutes. Most times if they had the money they would pay - so wish them the best of luck. It&#x27;s usually always about money.<p>- If you have a simple contract, you can always take them to court and you will almost always win or they will settle. I always do it myself, no lawyer. I always choose to not take down the site when I have a contract, I prefer the judgement or settlement if it goes that far.<p>- Make sure the project has the potential of being successful. I am always approached with bad ideas and although they are willing to pay, successful projects pay off in multiples over the long term. It&#x27;s not up to me to tell someone their idea sucks, but I do believe that if they are not willing to take some basic advice - there is a higher risk of issues. If not payment, satisfaction.<p>I hope this didn&#x27;t run too long, but bottom line, this type of publicity is not positive and as stated above, these things happen, rarely. Build a process to handle these issues and focus on finding better clients ALWAYS - not chasing bad ones.",1377448509

Use a static page cache / serve static HTML. Either use something like Varnish, or if you don&#x27;t want to configure it or you&#x27;re on a shared host, use one of the following extensions/techniques to statically cache pages:<p><pre><code>  - Wordpress: http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/

  - Joomla: http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/performance/cache/13155
  - Rails: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html

There are two differences I can think of at the moment:<p>- The lazyness of lists. &quot;1 naturals (add) map&quot; will produce an infinite list of integers from 1. This introduces some interesting difficulties. For example, what would you expect &quot;1 naturals (add) map 2 swap 5 take&quot; to produce? It will clearly either be (1 2 3 4 5) or (2 3 4 5 6). I pick the first  because it produces less surprising results. So, when map is called, it saves the state of the stack, so it doesn&#x27;t end up seeing the 2 pushed on the stack.<p>- I added lexically-scoped &quot;arguments&quot; to functions because I found them useful. The commands &quot;arg-[a-d]&quot; will &quot;remember&quot; the top four values on the stack, even if the lazyness of the language changes the top four values on the stack by the time it reaches these commands.<p>I guess one other difference is that functions here are typed, but that&#x27;s not really a fundamental difference with other concatenative languages.<p>As for F and XY, I haven&#x27;t looked in to them much. A cursory glance, however, leads me to believe that when pushed to their limits, I&#x27;d expect the arithmetic-encoded programs to be significantly shorter. The 22 different tokens in the 8 queens program condense in to 17 bytes. (And, this assumes that all functions of a valid type are equally likely to be called -- I&#x27;d expect most programs to get shorter once I spend some time figuring out reasonable weights for the encoder). That said, I definitely see some things I&#x27;m going to steal from those languages.",1377447480

It was sent via Mandrill so I reported it to Mandrill&#x27;s abuse team; most people would probably just mark it as spam, harming the reputation of Mandrill&#x27;s mail servers, thus making it more difficult for Mandrill to be used for legitimate email sending.

And you have to remember, that most touch phones sucked at the time, and they ALL sucked if they didn&#x27;t have a stylus, and it was a really, really, big deal to have an all touch interface that truly worked.<p>And, it wasn&#x27;t as if Microsoft didn&#x27;t have a mobile OS. Windows Mobile always worked decently, but never was just truly great. And it never focused on being just for phones. It was adaptable to any type of mobile environments, like Android is trying to do right now.<p>It is also more difficult to implement new technologies on top of old ones, which was Microsoft&#x27;s first choice when they tried to make the phone part of Windows Mobile more modern, until they realized that that house of cards wouldn&#x27;t stand. Then they did a rewrite of, which lead to Windows 7.<p>So, from Microsoft&#x27;s point of view, it was a limited phone, that had no way of adding apps, no business functionality, no keyboard for typing, no true enterprise security, and for a whole lot of money, only available on AT&T. I too thought that the original iPhone wasn&#x27;t that great, only marginally better than the ROKR E1, functionality-wise. Though, I did think that that original iPhone screen was truly awesome.<p>So, let&#x27;s not come down to, to hard on Balmer for not recognizing the iPhone at first for the threat it came to be.",1377446896

Things like purity and referential transparency (e.g.: as seen in Haskell) make code analysis and transformation much simpler. They enable things like pattern-matching type transformations on code. If the compiler has to reason about pointers, invisible side-effects and alias analysis, it greatly limits the kinds of things that can be inferred about a program.",1377446759

6272462,comment,6271259,6272028,1,0,hugnificent,,,"Allies spy on each other all the time.  Alliances are simple two dimension structures, counties align themselves will all sorts of interests that sometimes seem contradictory.  Look at the Israelis for example, they spy on the US.  But they clearly benefit from the US&#x27;s support.  nevertheless, it makes sense for them to spy on the US, first they need to know what the US really thinks to protect their interests (the US isnt always publicly stating its true ntetions) and sometimes the US may have intel the Israelis do not).  thats just one example of allies spying.<p>In general terms, any intelligent government is going to want to know what&#x27;s happening in the world to its interests because people, and countries, lie and withhold information.  So in general terms, everyone spies on everyone.<p>Who is your ally in one matter may not be in another.  For example, China is neither an ally nor an enemy to the US.  US Sino relations are complicated, sometimes the two agree and work together, sometimes they do not.  If two countries cooperate on some things, but not others should they blindly trust each other?  Of course not.  What if they mostly agree?  Should they still blindly trust each other?  I would hope not.  Again, consider how allies sometimes to lie to each other to get them to support their cherished positions.  Nations have a duty to their citizens, and shouldn&#x27;t blindly follow their allies statements of so-called fact.  How else does a nation meet this duty if it doesn&#x27;t cast a wary eye on its allies?  It spies on them.<p>Equally, sometimes traditional allies are opposed on certain things, or may be lying as the Greeks were about their national finances.  Im sure the EU wishes it knew that earlier.<p>The word ally isn&#x27;t the same thing as &quot;always on my side&quot;.  These are nations we&#x27;re talking about, that operate in their own interests, lie to each other and dont always operate in their friends interests.  It seems reasonable for allies to be a bit wary of each other and to not assume allies will just always act in their allies best interests.  And alas, spy on each other find out what&#x27;s really going on.",1377446597

McDonalds may be the largest burger &#x27;restaurant&#x27; but that doesn&#x27;t mean they are the best. I have a feeling anyone can make a better burger (or tofu burger) than McDonalds.<p>Sure, the &quot;war&quot; helps drive innovation. But, sometimes it&#x27;s just innovation for innovation sake and not really providing value. Such as HDMI output on smartphones. I&#x27;m guessing less than 0.01% of people care about that one.<p>Anyway, I like my iPad/iPhone/OS X experience. I&#x27;m happy and that is all that matters to me in the end when I buy something. I had played with some Samsung products using Android (since I was going to port some of my iOS applications over) and I was completely disappointed. I passed that development onto someone else. :-)<p>Anyway, to each his/her own! I&#x27;m pretty sure more people buy Honda cars than BMW or Tesla and that doesn&#x27;t mean BMW or Tesla are losing the car wars.",1382475592

IMHO a part of it is still relevant even if you don&#x27;t shoot for the stars. After all every business (even the &quot;lifestyle&quot; one) needs some good practices to (at least) stay on the market and avoid the fate of an expensive hobby. Yesterday I had a similar discussion on the workshop with a group of SMB owners/managers (mostly experienced people running the business for many yrs - up to 30, but there were also a few startups). All of them were in real need for an actual change to either grow or keep up with the evolving market. We were working on their business models and I was using well known examples of companies as illustrations. One of the guys suddenly asked &quot;Why are we talking about such big companies? We are not them.&quot; The answer was pretty simple - if you want to learn and get inspired there&#x27;s only one direction to look - up.",1382475555

I understand that people use and like Apple products, and that they want to hear and discuss news about it. I&#x27;m complaining that the devices that I <i>do</i> care about, the news I <i>do</i> want to see and discuss, are being removed from the site. The only products announcements that can exist are those from Apple and to a lesser extent, Google.<p>There are people here who use Microsoft products and like the Nokia phones. I like discussing the news with them, especially news of the magnitude we&#x27;ve seen this morning. However, some people feel that this is not within our rights and having Nokia/Microsoft news on their site is inappropriate. This is a big fucking problem. I like HN, I really do. It&#x27;s a great platform and there are some great people here. But if you think it would be better if the only products that could be discussed with excitement are Apple products, that&#x27;s a big problem. This isn&#x27;t Apple Hacker News. Hackers develop for Windows too; hackers use Windows Phone too. What I&#x27;m upset about is that the Nokia/Microsoft news was flagged off the front page, and, just like I predicted, the Apple news (no matter how minor) floods in right on cue.<p>I know there are other sites talking about Nokia and Microsoft. That&#x27;s fine, but I really like HN and I really like discussing exciting news with this community. That can&#x27;t happen if the news that we find exciting is being improperly flagged by a band of anti-Microsoft zealots. You might notice I&#x27;ve commented on a lot of the Apple news today. It&#x27;s interesting, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m not going to try to get Apple-related articles off the front page, because I&#x27;m not a fucking asshole. But don&#x27;t point me to a different god damned site. I don&#x27;t hate Apple products. I hate holier-than-thou zealots who feel that anyone who uses a product they don&#x27;t like is a second-class citizen.<p>But why am I arguing with you?

If you ever go and work on the other side of the &quot;computer store&quot; you should see that most of the customers do come to buy a computer and not an operation system and often they do not even understand how powerful computer they need.<p>Of course there are those who have heard that Apple computers are good and buy Apple because of that, but those who do not have money for Apple computers do buy Microsoft computers because they do not have other choice at least here in Finland as we do not have any Linux or BSD computers on sale and probably never have had one on a regular home electronics store at least I have not seen.<p>It is also such a fiasco trying to sell Windows 8 computers when the customers who do not have money for Apple computers do not want Windows 8 because of the bad rumors which have gone really far and even beyond. They only decide to buy these Windows 8 computers because we do not have any Windows 7 computers on sale anymore and they are not ready to buy another operation system because they know someone on their family will pirate Windows 7. Those who do not know how to replace Windows 8 are stuck with it.<p>So where does a regular customer have the option to decide the operation system for the hardware they want in the store? There is only Microsoft until customer has enough cash to pay for Apple.<p>Oh boy I forgot about Chrome OS. It&#x27;s cheap and people buy it because of the cheap price, but the return amount has been pretty damn high, because Chrome OS just can not do what those little more advanced computer users want like native gaming.

Civil service is boring and bureaucratic <i>by design</i>, specifically it was created to combat the &quot;spoils system&quot; that plagued the early American state [1] (though the prize of modern state eclipse what Tammany Hall etc could have imagined). Modern corporations are agile by having a command structure which lets them quickly maximize profits - which is great if we believe the market system benefits everyone when operating properly. But states with the ability to trample the fences of ordinary market shouldn&#x27;t not be also given the ability to move quickly and agilely to do this. Corporations have no internal limits to their &quot;greed&quot; but we citizens of democratic market capitalism are assuming that&#x27;s OK, indeed desirable, as long as the corporation face the strong <i>external</i> limit of markets and individual choice.<p>The current fashion for what could be called &quot;state-enforced private consumption&quot; is sold as giving us the best of all possible worlds but in reality gives us the worst (IE. the reality is the wealth of this society is indeed being vacuum-out by a kind of private-public rent seeker limited by neither the traditional bounds of the democratic state or traditional bounds of the market).<p>Note: I&#x27;m not a conservative rooting against Obamacare. It seems like it was a terrible approach for achieving affordable healthcare but I still would prefer it succeeded that failed because, well, I and many friends need it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoils_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoils_system</a>",1382473846

The map app would give me incorrect data (store/restaurant locations for Tucson Arizona) and it became annoying enough that I just relied on my iPhone for map stuff.

It&#x27;s hard to find long-term difficulty reporting.[1]<p>Of course when bitcoin spenders are willing to wait up to 10 minutes for blocks, and Terracoin targets 2 minute blocks, even &quot;network&#x27;s running slow&quot; seems pretty fast in relative terms, as long as it&#x27;s not uncontrolled adjustment.<p>They must be doing something right, they&#x27;re still/currently the most profitable Alt-SHA256 coin, even if the share prices have taken a serious dump.[5]<p>[1] <a href=""http://pool.bitcoinreactor.com/pool/statistics/?cur=trc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pool.bitcoinreactor.com/pool/statistics/?cur=trc</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://trc.cryptocoinexplorer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trc.cryptocoinexplorer.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.cryptsy.com/markets/view/27"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cryptsy.com/markets/view/27</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://terracoin.org/news.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terracoin.org/news.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency</a>",1382472486

The finger and the stylus are different input devices with different levels of ease of use and accuracy.  It is wrong to assume they are meant to accomplish the same tasks.  No device should be limited to either one... finger or stylus.  I use the stylus to draw on my Surface and quite frankly I love what it allows me to do.  But when I go back to surfing, fingers all the way.",1382472302

Using differential signaling (as both those standards do) does give you some noise immunity and does help with the ground issue somewhat.<p>The problem is that ground loops can <i>easily</i> generate 10&#x27;s of volts at the highest impedance point, and there <i>will</i> be ground loops if you try to use this for &quot;smart homeish&quot; things.  Most bus drivers and receivers aren&#x27;t meant for voltages that high--many drivers/receivers have absolute maximum ratings only a few hundred millivolts below ground.<p>Isolating everything isn&#x27;t a conceptually difficult thing to do, but you&#x27;ll spend just as much on optoisolators as you would have on ethernet magnetics.",1382472240

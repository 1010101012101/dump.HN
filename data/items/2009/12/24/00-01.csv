1013157,comment,1012381,1012986,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think it may be more that there are certain mental blocks that can hold you back completely, but once you get over them, your skills improve rapidly.  Some people are fortunate enough to <i>start</i> with the ""right"" way of thinking about those, and so they just sail over the blocks with ease.  Others need a mental shift in perspective before they can understand the fundamentals, and so they're ""stuck"" for a long time with virtually no progress.<p>I sailed through math and physics and chemistry in high school.  I suspect this is because my dad was a nuclear chemist.  I didn't have to learn how to think scientifically, because it was ingrained in me from the age of 3, and it never occurred to me to think any other way.  But I'm now in my late 20s, and it's the <i>other</i> kids in my high school class, the ones who struggled through everything, that are now finishing their chem Ph.Ds.  Because they decided consciously that chemistry was something they wanted to be good at, while I decided my interests lay elsewhere and didn't bother breaking through all the other mental blocks that crop up when you do college-level hard sciences.<p>I think a lot of skills have this same pattern - hard skills that can take forever to learn, followed by a bunch of easy and flashy tricks that come easily once you master the basics.  My violin tone improved markedly and rapidly once I learned to use ""arm weight"" instead of simply pressing hard on the string.  When I was doing whitewater kayaking, the experienced kayakers would say ""Once you learn to roll, your skills just shoot up, because you aren't afraid of trying things any more.""  Last Olympics, there was a video interview with the U.S. women's gymnastics team where they asked each of them ""What was the hardest skill to learn?""  Shawn Johnson replied, ""The hardest skill for me was my kip.""  (For non gymnastics fans, the kip is basically a prerequisite for all bars moves, and is usually learned around age 7.)  There's an Olympic champion, but if you looked at her gymnastics in elementary school, she spent well over a year on a really basic, fundamental skill that some people get in three tries!<p>I think this may be why a lot of software engineers ask about pointers and recursion as interview questions.  Those skills themselves are rarely useful.  But they are hard mental blocks that often weed out a lot of prospective programmers.  And once you've got them, a bunch of other algorithms and data structures open up for you.  If you understand pointers and recursion, you can learn about linked lists, balanced trees, dynamic programming, hashtables, and all those other fundamentals in short order.  If you don't, you might forever be stuck using frameworks that other people put together for you.",1261616103

Not saying that this is what you're advocating, but the builder pattern avoids this (by allowing immutable objects to be created).<p>That being said, much like other design patterns, the Builder pattern substitutes for something Java lacks: pass by name parameters. Sure, a third generation IDE (IDEA, Eclipse, Netbeans) can generate/refactor the code for me (which allows me to be almost as quick with Java as I am with Perl, Python and Scala) but it can't <i>read</i> the code.<p>Additionally, on the JVM if the builder is also an inner class, the are issues introduced with using it in some non-Java languages. I've ran into this issue when using Avro and Protocol Buffers with Scala (can easily be circumvented, by either modifying the code or using a Java ""facade"").

1013146,comment,1013024,1013097,0,0,bokonist,,,"The problem is that the word ""deflation"" has been corrupted to refer to two entirely different phenomena:<p>1) It can refer to generally falling prices due to increasing productivity. This is entirely beneficial. Video game consoles, transistors, etc, experience deflation and it results in consumers getting better products.<p>2) A contraction in the money supply, or a shock to the demand for money. The classic example is the bank run that wipes out people's deposits. This type of deflation is terrible because it results in falling aggregate demand, idle factories, and unemployment.<p>The first type of deflation is beneficial is good, and the second kind is very bad.<p>The Fed and mainstream economists believe that both kinds of deflation need to be stopped. Economists thus argue for constant inflation to prevent even the slight possibility of slipping into deflation.<p>To me, this is like arguing that a balloon should be constantly inflated to prevent any chance of it ever deflating. That's not a recipe for preventing deflation, its a recipe for blowing a bubble and then having a disastrous popping. Which is exactly what has happened happened.",1261615736

1013143,comment,1013024,1013024,0,0,bigwill,,,"This ""hidden tax"" applies to the government as well. Inflation expectations are baked into the valuation of financial instruments. For example, if investors think inflation is going to be high they'll demand a higher interest rate on their bonds. <i>Inflation is part of the interest rate</i>. This includes the interest rates at which the government borrows, so they're not particularly jazzed about a high inflation ""tax"" either. So if you're sitting on dollars and paying this tax, you can rather easily be compensated for it by lending that money.",1261615632
1013142,comment,1012381,1012755,0,0,sshumaker,,,"As someone who's been on both sides of the fence, this is untrue.  You pay people more or less what is sufficient to keep them happy (within reason).  When you're hiring a new employee, you tend to pay them their current salary + some percentage raise.  So the biggest determining factor of your salary will be how much you made at your last job.<p>This does mean that you end up with employees who are clearly superior getting paid less than some of their inferior peers.  Certainly when I was a mere employee the idea that I was working harder and better than someone who got paid twice my salary was galling.  But there are plenty of employees who aren't as concerned about what their peers are getting paid.  Most of the time, assuming your salaries are relatively generous, I've learned that employees feel they are personally being rewarded sufficiently, and that's what matters to them.  For those who make it more of an issue, you try to accommodate them if they're worth it.<p>That said, it is really important to reward superstars to keep them really happy.  Often, this means salary / bonuses, but sometimes it means type of work and the role they get to play on the project.",1261615586

I have used Rails for some time now but have always been reluctant to really get in there and take a look around because by the time I got to it, Rails was already a seemingly huge behemoth of a code base and I didn't think I could devote enough time towards getting my head around it. These kinds of changes to the organisation of the code make me feel like maybe I have a chance at delving into the now more discrete internals and in the process, becoming a more efficient user of the framework and perhaps one day, even give something back.<p><i>One nice immediate benefit of all of this is that ActionMailer gets all of the functionality of ActionController in a clean, intentional way.

There's a lot of synergy between modern programming languages.<p>For instance, I started with Java, then moved to Python, learned COBOL and a little bit of php and ASP around the same time, then finally switched to Ruby, where I do most of my programming now. A lot of the things I learned in Java were still relevant in Python, and the same was true with the switch from Python to Ruby. COBOL was a bit of an outlier since I wasn't using the OO version of COBOL, but I already had a grasp on logic and flow of control, so even that wasn't that much of a stretch.<p>I'm definitely not one of those elite programmers, even though I do seem to grasp concepts better than a lot of my classmates, so I find categorizing domain as a programming language in relation to programmer ability is flawed.

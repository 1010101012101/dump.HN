6974261,comment,6973220,6974086,9,0,superuser2,,,"Apple&#x27;s closed-ness is mostly about protecting the user experience.<p>- OSX is only available on relatively expensive Apple hardware because Apple sets (high) minimum standards on quality and &quot;official&quot; OSX on shitty hardware would pollute the brand.<p>- iOS apps are sandboxed and the App Store is curated to protect users from scammy/spammy/malicious apps.<p>- OSX enforces code signing, again, to protect users from malware. It can be switched off by users who demonstrate clear intent and understanding of the consequences.<p>- Parts that are non-user-serviceable are usually that way to achieve smaller form factor and higher capacities. The reason for non-user-serviceable batteries, for example, is that batteries are bags of dangerous chemicals inside of heavy and thick protective cases. Making <i>the entire laptop</i> the &quot;case&quot; for the battery lets them get larger batteries in less space and weight. That it cannot be safely removed by a nontechnical user is a side-effect.<p>Your comment attributes a sort of &quot;inverse FSF&quot; religious sentiment to Apple, as if they make things closed and locked down just for the hell of it, because they believe in closedness the way Stallman believes in freedom.<p>Reality indicates that most of their restrictions are about protecting users who don&#x27;t know better.... you&#x27;re not going to &quot;accidentally&quot; replace your CPU. There&#x27;s no legitimate problem that would be solved by whitelisting processors. Could they do it? Yes, but only if they exhibited some sort of fanatic obsession with preventing users from achieving what they want even when it serves no other purpose. Which would be stupid. Hence, it&#x27;s as likely as Microsoft being run by lizard people :).",1388213807

6974244,comment,6971935,6972544,2,0,chetanahuja,,,"mbuf chains [1] (or something like them) are the canonical way of receiving data from the network. You basically &quot;tag&quot; every incoming chunk of data as an mbuf, and keep the data as linked lists of said mbufs (hence the mubf &quot;chain&quot;). Some key properties of incoming network data are that it&#x27;s:<p>1) Arriving asynchronously, at arbitrary time points (actually the OS code gets to handle the incoming data in interrupt processing routines)<p>2) Arriving in arbitrary quantities in each new chunk(as opposed to, say, reading nice, aligned, blocks from the disk)<p>3) Possibly arriving out of order.<p>Now if you consider the requirements that you have this uncertain sized chunks of data that you (the network stack code) need to parse into (and possibly reorder into) one of many possible protocols then deliver it in a nicely packaged form to a user process (which may or may not be ready to receive this data at this moment) --- and, additionally, there&#x27;s a lot of pressure to avoid unnecessary memory copies --  you&#x27;ll be inevitably led towards an architecture that looks somewhat like mbuf chains.<p>The cited writeup and accompanying code has some crucial details hiding in the following snippet<p><i>&quot;the Packets go in &#x27;pbufs&#x27; which are, in general, the property of a particular device.&quot;</i><p>The point I think is that it&#x27;s special purpose code written for a narrow use/demo case. Not meant to be taken seriously for an actual, general purpose OS.<p>tl;dr mbuf chains are inevitable for general purpose networking.

6974196,comment,6974029,6974029,1,0,tunesmith,,,"A question about patent protesting -<p>Is it really useful to demonstrate a technique&#x27;s ease of implementation <i>after</i> the fact?  I thought the whole point of a patent is that it offers protection for a process/technique/invention that is new but easily duplicated.<p>For instance, I know of a case where a materials company invested huge amounts of money to come up with a new kind of teflon - a new kind of &quot;flat&quot; molecular structure - such that the material can be easily applied on top of other surfaces every x months.  So it becomes a licensing or subscription income for them, and large companies use it because it helps them meet their environmental impact regulations.<p>Now for materials people, it&#x27;s a process or invention that may be described as completely obvious in hindsight, and easily copied (by other materials companies).  But then the initial materials company would be out their research money.  And this is exactly what the patent system is for, to protect against people from copying something that is far easier to produce <i>after</i> invention than <i>before</i>.  Without the patent system, it chills the R&D efforts for these kinds of incremental improvements.<p>So I don&#x27;t really see the point of publishing a proof of concept of this sort of thing after someone else announces a patent on it.  Putting &quot;Inspired by iA Writer Pro&quot; on the page just seems like a case of advertising patent infringement.<p>I <i>do</i> think the IAWriter patent is silly, and there&#x27;s probably prior art out there, but this doesn&#x27;t argue that point.  It seems to be more a case of civil disobedience, and that may be the point, but I don&#x27;t see how it really furthers the argument that it <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be patented.<p>TL;DR: Just because something is easily duplicated after it&#x27;s patented is not sufficient demonstration to show it shouldn&#x27;t have been patented.",1388212184
6974195,comment,6971127,6972068,10,0,bodyfour,,,"I&#x27;m not the commenter you&#x27;re replying to, but I&#x27;ll take a crack.<p>Saying it was a matter of &quot;simplicity&quot; glosses over too many of the details to be useful.  Also consider that many things that early UNIX didn&#x27;t include from multics got added back later (memory mapped files, dynamic linking, symlinks, ...) so by that measure it was maybe <i>too</i> simple.<p>A few points to consider:<p>* Multics was a joint project, and each participant had different levels of commitment and priorities for the project.  This wasn&#x27;t a recipe for success (see also: Taligent, OS/2)<p>* Hardware.  UNIX moved to the PDP-11 soon after that machine became available.  That machine went on to become the smash hit of the decade, especially in academia.  The GE and Honeywell mainframes that Multics ran on continued their decades-long loss to IBM.<p>I&#x27;ve often wondered how different history would be if Bell Labs had bought any other minicomputer for the project.  Probably today UNIX would only be known as a bunch of research papers.  By skill or by luck they landed on the platform that would let their creation spread.<p>* Language choice.  When the Multics project kicked off, using PL/I seemed like a progressive choice.  After all, it had been designed by all the right committees!  However, PL/I only had a moment in the sun.<p>To me, the single most impressive thing about the original UNIX team was that they also built C at the same time.  This created a virtuous cycle where language-geeks wanted to use C (and thus wanted UNIX) and OS geeks wanted UNIX (and ended up learning C).  If PL/I had lived up to its billing of being the true successor to Algol then C might not have had a void to fill and this cycle wouldn&#x27;t be possible.<p>* Being born to the right (corporate) parent.  Building even a small OS at that time cost quite a bit of money: not only to pay bright people for years to work on it, but to buy the minicomputers they needed.  Bell labs had the resources and interest to do this but, uniquely, couldn&#x27;t meaningfully productize it (due to their status as the telephone monopoly at the time)  This meant that in the early days it was near-free, source code included.  If UNIX had instead been developed inside of a computer company it would have been turned into an exclusive product and probably wouldn&#x27;t have spread so far in its early days.  Bell labs was one of the few organizations outside academia that would have done this.<p>* Just plain talent.  The UNIX guys were, of course, flat out brilliant.  Take pipes for example.  Multics had the ability for processes to be chained, but it wasn&#x27;t recognized as a first-class feature.. they were still thinking of programs as usually being separate beasts.  The flash of insight was &quot;this would be super-useful if all programs behaved this way and if the shell made it easy to construct&quot;  It&#x27;s not a matter of &quot;simplicity&quot;, but that they simply saw the problem in different way than everyone who came before.  In short, UNIX was just damn good.<p>Certainly UNIX started out as a simple system, and that was part of its success.  However, other things have been simple and never went anywhere.  The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that to understand why UNIX won you need to consider a lot more of the history.",1388212161

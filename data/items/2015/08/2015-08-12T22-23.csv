It was very important, but there was always a huge debate of what was important to comment. One developer thought that adding docblocks was just enough. The other thought about commenting the why of code blocks etc.<p>So your question may sound like &quot;How important it is to live within your own means&quot;. Everyone will agree, at some level, the living within means is important - but people will diverge on whether you just give up your goals or aiming for them anyway.<p>Comments as much as code are meant for human eyes. The main difference are that comments are not executed, therefore they are less likely to be updated when the reason for a piece of code changes as well. Programmers update code until it compiles and passes tests, but it doesn&#x27;t follow they update comments accordingly. Nothing is more misleading than an outdated comment.<p>Also, you might find those who will say that if the code is self-evident, then it does not need commenting. Which is theoretically true, but usually people miscalculate the ability of later read to extract context of uncommented code.",1439420360

10051312,comment,10049631,10050643,0,0,rconti,,,"$190k, I assume.<p>Salaries are higher here for one.  Say $190k vs 4x as much, $760k. Assuming magic 10% down appears in your pocket, 0% property tax, ignore the differences in state/local taxes, and assume a spherical chicken in a vacuum.... $3200/mo vs $800/mo.<p>4 times as much!  Wow! That&#x27;s a lot of money. Right? Except.. it&#x27;s &quot;only&quot; $29k/yr. Most cost-of-living expenses don&#x27;t scale with income.  Now, of course, your salary has to be more than that to cover taxes, but say 20% overall tax rate, you really only need $36k more per year, which you might see straight up on a single salary, based on cost-of-living pay adjustment alone. If you&#x27;re married, suddenly you only have to make $18k per person per year more.<p>If you follow the &quot;1/3 of your salary&quot; rule, it would suggest that you need to make $86,400 per year more, which is why expensive housing sounds so expensive. One would hope that in a low cost-of-housing market, you&#x27;re not spending 1/3 of your income on your housing, because then you really don&#x27;t have a lot of money left over for retirement or food or entertainment. Similarly, in a higher cost-of-living market, you might fudge that a bit and pay more than 1/3 of your salary, which still leaves you more money for your 401k and transportation and entertainment, and all those things that really don&#x27;t scale with cost of living much at all.<p>You could also look at the high cost of living as a savings plan. As long as you retire <i>before</i> whatever particular housing cycle bubble bursts, you can still retire to Texas (or wherever) -- you can just do so with more money (equity, savings, retirement plan, etc).<p>Also, some tax and expense treatment of housing is pretty regressive. You&#x27;re probably not getting a mortgage interest/property tax income tax deduction on a cheap mortgage; on a more expensive one you are, so you&#x27;re immediately paying a lower effective interest rate and property tax rate (if you want to look at it that way). You&#x27;re not paying PMI for that sub-20% down payment because it&#x27;s not federally backed. etc.<p>This is not to say it&#x27;s cheap, or easy, or affordable for everyone, or even smart. It&#x27;s just saying how it&#x27;s possible, and how it&#x27;s <i>probably</i> not as bad as it sounds.",1439420188

The technical skills and infrastructure that fueled Kodak and Xerox are still around; many engineers operate at smaller shops or do consulting. RIT and the University of Rochester are still graduating quality students. Optics is still prominent in Rochester, and there&#x27;s a good deal of defense tech you don&#x27;t hear about (Harris RF, Exelis Geospatial Systems, Pictometry, TeledyneOptech, Tyco, et al.).

It&#x27;s affordable; the median house price is <$75k (maybe triple that in the affluent suburbs). There&#x27;s no traffic, there&#x27;s abundant water, energy is cheap, food is inexpensive and local, and people are civically-involved. There are bike trails and there is Wegmans. The geographic location is not one prone to natural disasters (except blizzards if you count those). The parks are beautiful, and there&#x27;s a festival every other weekend during the warm months. Unlike cheap places in the midwest, it&#x27;s a short hop to NYC, Boston, or Toronto.

To put it simply the reactor is like a bowl of radioactive soup with a plug at the bottom made of ice and self refrigerated using the power produced by the reactor. If it stops working, plug melts, soup flows out of the bowl and reactor stops. The soup is not too radioactive, and thorium is more Common.<p>This design is not without challenges, but certainly not bigger than fast reactors and nuclear reprocessing. There was even working prototypes in the USA very early in the atomic age. However, Thorium reactors do not produce plutonium, and so, cannot be the technology selected in a cold war context where you need to build atomic weapons by the score.<p>So, no such reactors are in service today, but they are being studied, especially in India if I recall properly.<p>The reactors you see today were designed to produce bombs primarily. They only produce energy as an happy side effect. Safety was important, but not the main design goal.<p>To fix this, you need to overcome two problems.<p>1: you must convince governments to pile billions on developing this technology, with no military goal or economical incentive in sight.<p>2: you must overcome resistence to change of existing industry, who basically must turn their known design upside down.

(A lot of them happen to be luxury units which often sit vacant since they are used purely as investment vehicles by foreign entities, but that&#x27;s a separate problem.) The real issue is that Manhattan is an island, and there&#x27;s only so much you can cram into 33 square miles (though they&#x27;re working on squeezing every last cubic inch out of that). They&#x27;re also, of course, building at an absolutely <i>unbelievable</i> pace in Brooklyn, Queens, and even the Bronx[0].<p>San Francisco, on the other hand, has been incredibly slow to build more inventory (and also build <i>upwards</i>), compared to the amount that the demand has increased. This may be partly due to zoning issues, but not entirely, and the situation that San Francisco is in is not typical of most cities.<p>Houston is famous for having no zoning code, but New York has a very extensive zoning code[1]. In fact, the market for air rights in New York is quite complicated and fascinating[2].

It is is an environmental tech startup in Los Angeles focused on bringing cleaner air to communities. Our objective is to provide localized data on air quality both indoors and outdoors and allow users to purify the air in their homes,thereby removing harmful toxins and reducing preventable hospital visits while also advocating a healthier lifestyle. We want to integrate air quality as a central
component of the “smarthome” through integration with NEST, Rachio, and other
“smart” products. We want to help people with asthma, respiratory air allergies,
and promote overall awareness about air quality. Our first product which will be
released in our kickstarter campaign in about a couple of weeks is called Inhale. I&#x27;ve included the specifics below. Our website is www.krafftit.com<p>INHALE- Smartphone Application - ios, android (FREE)
Inhale is a software product that aggregates air quality data from the government (ozone, pm 2.5, pollen) and displays it in a patent protected intuitive way for users to plan outdoor activities based on the air quality in their area. Our algorithm also provides predictions for up to four days to let users to be aware of the air quality and potential for overexposure around them. The final component is the ability for the software tool to measure the total amount of ozone,
pm 2.5, or pollen inhaled through the duration of an outdoor activity by using the pulse meter on a smartwatch o smartphone.",1439417795

I don&#x27;t think we have the tools, either technical or managerial, to build fully-remote companies that are as effective as in-person companies. There are niches where this is true, but they&#x27;re not particularly fun places to work: call centers come to mind. Companies are living, breathing, organic organizations.<p>The fundamental assumption that I&#x27;d challenge is that productivity towards a goal is what&#x27;s hold back most organizations (or divisions / teams). I think productivity can be a bottleneck, but most of what makes companies successful is doing the <i>right</i> thing, not the <i>most</i> things. (Otherwise, startups could never compete.) As of 2015, I don&#x27;t believe we have ways to get everybody in a company aligned in ways to make that happen. One of the most powerful ways of getting people working on the right things is to have them hang out with each other. Sitting next to each other, getting coffee with each other, BSing with each other before / after meetings, etc. There&#x27;s a lot of unstructured communication that&#x27;s simply lost, even with tools like Slack.<p>If that direction is there, then you can start to complain about things like lost productivity and commutes.

Screwing about with gitian and gcc all day is right at the bottom of my list of &quot;fun things to do on a sunny day&quot;.<p>But the fact that Bitcoin Core was heading for disaster was obvious for a long time now. It has been progressively abandoning things that the user community finds important:  SPV wallets, unconfirmed transactions, now even the notion of growing the platform at all have all become &quot;controversial&quot; and therefore untouchable. Anyone who suggests that maybe these things are useful is immediately branded an idiot. Combine with a maintainer who hides any time a decision is needed and you have a recipe for deadlock.<p>You seem to think I hate Tor. I am actually the maintainer of a full blown Tor implementation (Orchid). I&#x27;ve done a lot of work on integrating it into bitcoinj and I&#x27;m basically the only guy who can actually move the needle on Tor/Bitcoin usage, by enabling the use of it by default in consumer wallets that have hundreds of thousands of installs. We&#x27;re not there yet (it&#x27;s still too slow) but we&#x27;re a lot closer than before.<p>This doesn&#x27;t change the fact that Tor is heavily abused. It can be useful but it&#x27;s a frequent source of attacks of all kinds. So finding ways to get the good without the bad involves some tricky coding.<p>Below, you say &quot;anyone can jam the network with just two IP addresses&quot;. Yes, that&#x27;s unfortunate isn&#x27;t it. I&#x27;ve been sounding the alarm about Bitcoin Core&#x27;s poor DoS protection for years. Nobody listened,  that&#x27;s why I have now written a new anti-DoS system that can handle this sort of thing. It starts by clustering and deprioritising Tor because we&#x27;ve seen actual jamming attacks that came through Tor, and because using it is a lot safer and more convenient for an attacker than using your own IP addresses or using a botnet. But it absolutely should be extended to have more advanced heuristics.

As I see it, most (existing) users of a given subreddit appreciate the improvement in quality that results from moderation, yet when some of the lazier instincts of those same people are pooled by mass low-effort voting, funny or memetic or clickbait or flamebait but ultimately low-quality posts tend to rise.  For example, on this site, posts whose titles contain &quot;NSA&quot; and some other keyboards are or were penalized in the ranking, because people here, including many of the most famous users on the site, just love to read and talk about the NSA - which isn&#x27;t itself bad, but since it&#x27;s so easy and compelling to instinctively hit the upvote arrow on such posts, it tends to get too common and repetitive, so the algorithm taps (tapped?) the brakes.  (At least, that&#x27;s my interpretation of the reason.)  As another example, /r/smashbros is a big subreddit for the Super Smash Bros. competitive community, and it&#x27;s often happened that the moderators banned X type of posts (comics, non-competitive gifs) because a lot of people were complaining about it and there seemed to be consensus against - but that didn&#x27;t mean the posts didn&#x27;t get upvotes.  You could chalk that up to a difference between the vocal minority and the many lurkers, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the full story.<p>Admittedly, I&#x27;ve strayed pretty far from the sort of things that can happen on Twitter.  After all, it&#x27;s not like any feature of the site would discourage me from following 100 people who all constantly post about the NSA, and voting is different from posting.  But I think there&#x27;s a similar general principle when it comes to length, the one important form of &quot;moderation&quot; the site actually has: a user might get annoyed at the overall phenomenon of the length of the posts in their timeline, but it&#x27;s difficult to exert social pressure on everyone to keep length down, and really easy to feel like one cannot say what one wants in 140 characters, whether or not this is true, if one is not actually forced to make it fit.<p>Also, the aforementioned general case of splits in the community <i>does</i> apply to Twitter.  You can unfollow dickheads, but if lots of popular users are in the subgroup that actually prefers long posts, those users who prefer short ones will have a hard time keeping their streams &quot;clean&quot; without feeling like they&#x27;re missing out.  Of course, if one considers the Internet as a whole, one could say that following long-post users is the equivalent of participating in social websites that allow long posts, but unlike the discrete universes of different sites, or even of different subreddits (in the sense that a given post or comment goes only to a single subreddit), Twitter&#x27;s network allows, and indeed is designed for, cliques to partially overlap and mix, making it harder to establish different &quot;spaces&quot; with different rules, social customs, culture.",1439416979

The real problem does not come from operations, but from the waste these operations leave behind.<p>Minimizing and storing nuclear waste are the far greater challenges than just running the plants.<p>Another problem is the question, who is going to pay for all that waste in the end? Well first off, most likely future generations and when we look at the current time frame, that&#x27;s actually not as clear as one might think. For example, the German government has long struggled - and still is - to actually get the power plant operators to pay for the waste disposal. Before that is was pretty much &quot;We get to make the money basically for free, and you pay for the waste.&quot; Which of course is also an issue with the argument that nuclear power is cheap, because in most cases the cost of waste disposal and final storage are not included in the calculation, because these things can just &quot;happen later&quot;.<p>Waste disposal was way too long under the radar, so there was no pressure to develop new, better alternatives to the current reactor technologies for a very long time, since &quot;state of the art&quot; was just good enough, and cheap.",1439416855

Student loan payments, car payments, health care, etc. tend to cost the same whether you make 3X or 5X your rent.

It actually seems like a much cleaner and more secure abstraction ironically enough (running linux under solaris, effectively).

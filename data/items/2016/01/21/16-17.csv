They have a minimal terminal value, short lifespan, and there is virtually no barrier to enter the market.<p>Sort of like when google launched. The only surviving niche of google X is travel. You just google pets, not petsearches.io.<p>The equities market is so broken, and interest is so low, that there is an overspend into private markets. Value capture takes 20 years, company lifespan, i would baselessly guess, is 5 maybe. So this shit makes no sense.<p>Best bet is still make something you like working on, to the extent you represent other people, is pretty much your product demand.<p>But yeah mate, you could throw up a squarespace site and be the next cat bubble baths on demand startup.<p>I realized as a super shitty developer, that I will probably totally fail at this side project, but at least when someone gets it done i can say i was years ahead of the curve, just didnt have the chops.<p>...not that im bitter",1453395597

For instance, Capital: if Chinese/Russian billionaires decide to invest all their money in American companies in America, then it would result in huge economic growth.<p>Similarly Natural Goods: If prices of oil fall drastically, or lots of natural goods (even land) are discovered, then again there will be increased production of goods (i.e. more prosperity).<p>Finally, Labor: if labor prices fall drastically, or labor force is increased, again more production will happen. Prosperity will ensue.<p>The first two makes sense to most people, but somehow the third point doesn&#x27;t because most people are part of the labor force therefore emotions kick in. The simple logic you&#x27;re demonstrating is a childish whining:<p>> Tech execs and investors love to complain about having to pay six figure salaries to the engineers doing all the real work, all while carting home hundreds of millions themselves in just severance pay<<p>The whole job of tech execs and investors is to increase production. Acquiring capital for cheap (lower interest rates) would do the job, acquiring land/natural goods for cheap (like moving office to a cheaper part of the town) would also do the job, and finally getting cheap labor would also do the same thing.<p>Complaining against a businessman trying to find cheaper labor is like complaining against the QA for trying to find bugs in your code.",1453395470

The interesting thing is that the stashed parity ends up always equal to 1, indicating that the two qubits had opposite value.<p>The authors then start talking about this meaning that &quot;all the qubits are unequal&quot; because no matter which parity you stash, you end up discovering the two qubits were not equal. I think that&#x27;s a bit of a stretch, framing-wise. It&#x27;s the wrong way to think about it. For example, it stops working if you stash two of the parities instead of just one (you&#x27;ll start getting &quot;they were equal&quot; results half of the time).<p>Instead of talking about the qubits all being unequal, I prefer to think of this in terms of winning a game against a referee. You get three coins and can choose if each is set to heads or set to tails. Then a referee secretly picks two of the coins at random, measures their parity, and otherwise does nothing except pass the coins back to you. Then you do whatever you want to the coins, but have to choose whether or not to &quot;keep&quot; this run or &quot;discard&quot; it. You win if, whenever you say &quot;keep&quot;, the referee wrote down &quot;the coins differed&quot;. (Also you can&#x27;t just never say &quot;keep&quot;.)<p>Classically, there&#x27;s no strategy that wins the game 100% of the time. But if you&#x27;re using qubits instead of coins, quantum 2-level systems instead of classical 2-level systems, you <i>can</i> win 100% of the time (by using the circuit described above). In fact, the strategy works even if you have <i>a million</i> coins/qubits instead of just three!",1453395410

I was never debating this claim. Providing references to this claim is tangential to the point I was making. I was debating your original claim.<p>Your original claim:<p><pre><code>    It all looks nice until we get numbers from groups like \n    GapJumpers that institute blind auditions for hiring or \n    performance evaluations where evaluator can&#x27;t identify \n    what group they are. Starting out, these &quot;fair&quot; companies \n    are usually under 10% minority or women. Once they see  \n    only performance, it&#x27;s suddenly closer to 50/50. Hmm.\n</code></pre>\nFrom what you wrote, I think it&#x27;s fair to assume that companies exist that implemented blind auditions that are 50/50. Furthermore, since this debate is in the context of tech and because this was a reply to my comment about base rates, I also think it&#x27;s fair to assume that the companies in question are tech companies.<p>I&#x27;m also making a minor assumption that we&#x27;re talking about engineering positions at these companies since that is where most of the debate regarding the gender ratio is centered at. For non-engineering positions, I&#x27;ve not noticed a huge discrepancy in hiring. At the tech companies where I&#x27;ve worked, the non-technical side of the business is very balanced gender-wise. FWIW the technical recruiting departments responsible for sourcing most of the engineering candidates we interview are mostly women. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s important at all, but it&#x27;s an interesting observation.<p>With those two fair assumptions, both me and the other commenter considered your claim as written to be a very very bold claim. Your claim was tantamount to &quot;blind auditions are a panacea to the gender  (or other identity) diversity problem in hiring&quot;. Given that claim, that&#x27;s was we want a citation for. Where are these mythical 50/50 tech companies and how to they achieve 50/50 without being discriminatory when the base rate they are drawing from is approximately 88/12 (the approximate distribution of men to women with CS degrees)?<p>Given this, the &quot;scholarly work and experimental studies&quot; you found are interesting, but not really relevant because I never once challenged what blind auditions can achieve in an academic or experimental setting. I wanted a citation that references the &quot;fair&quot; companies you mentioned. because I was challenging that blind auditions can automagically achieve 50/50 without reverse discrimination in an industry where the population from which you draw candidates is far from 50/50. Had you limited your claim to academic and experimental studies, I wouldn&#x27;t have challenged it at all. I probably wouldn&#x27;t even had asked for a reference, since that&#x27;s not even an extraordinary claim.<p>With respect to your other comments. I&#x27;m not sure which claims of mine in particular you&#x27;re addressing or what anecdote in particular you&#x27;re talking about. I wrote a lot across several comments. The original claim I made, which was about the relevance of base rates with respect to race didn&#x27;t require a scholarly citation since I cited the data directly, much of which was US Census data, which is as authoritative as you get for the claim I&#x27;m making. For the other references I used, I could try to find the original source material instead of secondary references. Let me know which secondary references you have doubts about and I&#x27;d be happy to scrounge up the primary sources so we can debate the likelihood that they are valid.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m 100% in favor of blind auditions. I would love to be able to reduce a candidate&#x27;s identity down to a hash. I miss the internet back in 1995/6 when the only identity you had online was the one you created for yourself.",1453395070

People form bonds over their interests and experiences, like talking about their childhood or the TV/music they like--the more these differ, the harder it is to form that first superficial work bond. Even when the differences aren&#x27;t huge, it compounds enough that friend groups in the US are highly self-segregated.<p>To pick another race, it&#x27;s not rare to see Asian-Americans who were born and raised in America hanging out with a group of friends who are all Asian-American. The reasons could be as simple as bonding over the foods they ate growing up, the ways their parents raised them, and the TV shows / music they listened to (e.g. much more open to C-/J-/K-pop). It&#x27;s the same effect for all races/ethnicities I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Note that this ignores the more subtle but still important effect of people naturally liking people who look and dress like them, which has obvious racial and cultural ties too. For example, there are studies in the US that show that white people are fine living near black people, but not <i>too many</i> black people. Overtime, simulations show[1] that almost any definition of <i>too many</i> results in self-segregation.<p>IME coming from a working class background, economic background has a similar effect on relationships, but economic background is not visually obvious like race so it&#x27;s less discussed.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://ncase.me/polygons/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ncase.me/polygons/</a>",1453394220

I still don&#x27;t know everything on layers 5 and 6 (where&#x27;s the ℵ again?...). Start with the letters and punctuation (layers 1&2 plus bits of 3) and just type a lot of text for a week, maybe picking up things on layer 3 as you go. It&#x27;ll be painfully slow at first and your fingers might feel strangely exhausted (I never learned touch typing with QWERTZ) but you&#x27;ll get faster soon :)<p>It took me two to three weeks to get to a level where typing wasn&#x27;t a total point and another couple of weeks to exceed my old typing speed. The most helpful thing was to jump right in and never switch back to QWERTZ -- total immersion. I was a student at the time so I could take that luxury, but if you have a job you might not have that luxury. I have no idea how to best go about learning Neo if you still need to be able to type quickly while learning.<p>I rarely use Layer 4, I should probably learn that, but with a TrackPoint navigation is very easy without leaving the home row.<p>Occasional accents are no problem at all, Neo has combining diacritics (dead keys) so it&#x27;s similar to a compose approach (i.e. you press ` then e to get è, or ° a to get å).

It&#x27;s two selling points are (1) not having to run a new cable, and (2) significantly improved latency and packet loss compared to wifi while maintaining reasonable bandwidth.  I normally get about 70-80 mbps across my PLE adapters.  It is susceptible to picking up some interference at times, which cuts performance in half, but during those times the wifi is unusable for any sort of realtime/latency-sensitive applications.  I have local GigE segments in my living room and computer room, but I would need to run a drop to connect them and I rent.<p>USB-C and Thunderbolt are point-to-point bus connectors, they&#x27;re not designed to have multiple clients on a network.  Even if you designed a switch that could use ethernet-over-Type-C as a physical layer, the maximum length for an active cable is only 50 feet for USB 3.0 speeds and 82 feet for 2.0 speeds.  Passive cables are 15ft.  That&#x27;s not really enough for long runs inside a wall, so we&#x27;re back to asking the question:  OK, I plugged my USB Type-C into the wall.  <i>Now what?</i><p>If you&#x27;re going to actually run a new cable to your outlets, running Type-C seems like a poor choice.  You could stick a Type C ethernet adapter in a wall-socket formfactor, run CAT-6 in the walls, and call it a day.  That gets you runs of up to 330ft for GigE.  But if your vision is &quot;plug into the wall and instantly get on my network, without pulling ethernet to every outlet&quot; then you need something that runs over a power-line, because that&#x27;s the only wire that&#x27;s guaranteed to be run to a power outlet.",1453393159

I just can&#x27;t figure out the balance between the time in the game and time for everything else. I don&#x27;t play these games because of that.

7914016,comment,7913413,7913681,7,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Perhaps, and this would not surprise me in the least, it is vanity investing. Something which has some traction, clearly is scratching some itch, and is under valued relative to that traction. Here we are in June, a couple of months from April and it has 50,000 active users. With a bit of virality that gets to maybe 250K or 300K. Conceptually simple (probably not patented or otherwise circumscribed) the team is probably 2 maybe 3 people. So with the two founders and maybe an employee, its an easy Acqui-hire at $3M. So you put in your 1.2M, get prodded, sell for $3M and double your money in what, 6 months? A year? And I agree with your 1+M$ is nothing to sneeze at, a lot of good can be done with that. Welcome to the gangsta school of high tech investing :-) If you have the capital to play with you can lay down bets like this, and it is exactly like laying down a million bucks on the &#x27;pass&#x27; line at the casino. If they get an acquihire you get your money + 100% back, if they manage to keep the shine and traction going maybe you get back 2x or 3x your money, or maybe they fizzle and fade and people move on and you are out a million bucks. I was familiar with a guy who was a &#x27;player&#x27; and he mortgaged his house for nearly a million dollars and put it all into a &#x27;winner&#x27; startup/concept which, in his case, did not win. It was an &quot;interest only&quot; note with a big payment at the 5 year point, at which time he turned the house over to the bank. Very sad.<p>I will take exception though to the &#x27;dumb money&#x27; comment. It is dumb to gamble, but even smart people do it, it is a risk/reward trade-off. Smart people can look at the fundamentals here and see there is a possible &#x27;flip&#x27; opportunity, high risk, high reward, short time to closure. The trick will be to see in 3 years if it hasn&#x27;t flipped or exited by then. But that only tells you the payoff. I bought a $66M lottery ticket the other day, &#x27;dumb&#x27; ? Sure it was $2 put at risk. I chose not to buy a $2 soda. Probably not a smart allocation of capital, but the soda would have been turned into piss in short order, the lottery ticket has potential right up until the drawing :-).",1403143098

Maybe a project written in a dynamic language has a well-engineered, comprehensive unit test suite that is large enough to cover for most type errors. Maybe that same project in a statically-typed language might not require so many unit tests - or maybe it might. Maybe developers working on the dynamic language version of the project spend more time reading through the code to understand how unfamiliar modules work - or maybe they don&#x27;t. This sort of stuff is far more useful to know - and far more difficult to measure.<p>The 2% figure states little more than the fact that a project being developed by competent engineers can be debugged and tested to the point where the project becomes quite reliable and errors become rare, regardless of whether or not it is implemented using dynamic or static typing. I don&#x27;t think any reasonable static typing advocate would try to argue that static typing is the <i>only</i> way to catch type errors.<p>The parser study is even less informative. It covers a project of very small scope using both a custom language (with a type system of very little expressive power) and a custom development environment, and does not take into account long-term maintainability or extensibility.<p>If you want evidence, keep on looking.",1403142200

7913974,comment,7911875,7911875,1,0,eridius,,,"It seems to me that pools could still operate under this new protocol with a slight twist. Since the blockchain is public, every client that mines a block is public. So pools simply enforce the rule that every client in their pool that mines a block must immediately send the reward to the pool. Any client that fails to do so within a set period of time will be blacklisted from the pool. Clients still submit their proof of work to the pool in order to get credit for contribution, the only difference is this is now the 2-phase PoW.<p>This does increase the risk slightly, because a miner could contribute until such time as they successfully mine a block, keep the reward for themselves, get blacklisted, and then create a new key and rejoin the pool. This could be mitigated by enforcing rules like all pool members must refuse to participate in any transaction involving a blacklisted address, which if widespread enough (and if the blacklist is shared among pools) would force blacklisted clients to deal with mixing services. Pools could also try to strike agreements with other large players (e.g. bitcoin exchanges, mixing services, etc) for them to respect the pool blacklist.<p>So the real question is whether the increased risk is tolerable, and whether a pool under this new scheme can wield enough influence to get enough large players to respect their blacklist in order for it to be effective.",1403142123

7913924,comment,7912960,7913074,1,0,x1798DE,,,"The main criticisms of JS crypto that I&#x27;ve seen have nothing to do with the language, just that it&#x27;s in-browser scripting hosted by a third party. Even if the language were perfectly designed for cryptography, the problem is the trust model - every single time you decrypt or sign something, you need to load your private key (or give a password for key generation, or whatever) into the script, which means that you need to make sure that the code has not been subverted <i>every single time</i>, which is nearly impossible to do anyway. So if you try and offer a service that says, &quot;Even I can&#x27;t access your e-mails, they are end-to-end encrypted using Javascript in your browser!&quot;, that may be true right now, but you can revoke that trust unilaterally by changing the Javascript and I won&#x27;t notice. You could be compelled to do this. Your server might be compromised in some way, then all of a sudden you&#x27;ve got my private key. The whole problem that end-to-end encryption solves is that the server/cloud can only say, &quot;We won&#x27;t look at your data.&quot;, not &quot;We <i>can&#x27;t</i> look at your data.&quot; If you&#x27;re controlling the encryption process with javascript, then you can&#x27;t necessarily decrypt the data when it&#x27;s at rest, but the next time I log in, you could snatch my keys, and maybe you&#x27;ve already done that at some point. So now we&#x27;re back to a &quot;We <i>won&#x27;t</i> look at your data.&quot; model, because you&#x27;re just making the choice not to subvert the crypto javascript.<p>Think about what you&#x27;d do if you were going to install TrueCrypt or some other security/cryptography program. Assuming you didn&#x27;t want to build it from the source, you&#x27;d download a binary, and that binary would have an SHA or MD5 hash next to it, verifying that it&#x27;s the correct file. Other people who compile the binary from source should be able to generate the same file and compare the hashes, so at the very least it <i>can</i> be audited and you <i>can</i> verify that you&#x27;ve got what they say you have. To do the equivalent thing with in-browser Javascript, you&#x27;d need to check the MD5 hash of the javascript that you&#x27;re executing <i>every single time you use the script</i>, BEFORE you start the encryption/decryption process. You could use some sort of browser extension to check that the script you&#x27;re about to download and execute is the same one you&#x27;ve used before, but if you&#x27;re already installing browser extensions to do something like that, you might as well just install a browser extension that does the crypto for you without having a trust relationship with a server.",1403141155

Riskier, no.<p>I don&#x27;t like that Javascript doesn&#x27;t have native support for big integers (like Python does), or that it stores numbers as floating points in a 52-bit mantissa, but I fail to see why this makes developing crypto code riskier.<p>> Also, it seems to me like you are at least forgetting timing and possibly other side channels.<p>Well, I ain&#x27;t. When you don&#x27;t control the instructions being executed by the CPU you may have the risks of security-sensitive information leaks. This applies not only to Javascript, but also to all scripting languages. I could say that it also applies to Java, if the methods in its BigInteger class aren&#x27;t fixed-timing.<p>In other words using Javascript doesn&#x27;t make the problem any worse.

You could earn serious cold cash with that finding.<p>> I just can&#x27;t see any actual scenario where that helps, mostly because it seems to me that the cipher text usually would be a plain-text equivalent, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to the attacker whether they have the plain text or the cipher text.<p>I described where it helps in my article.<p>Re your last point: if doing SSH in a browser isn&#x27;t crypto I don&#x27;t know what could be.

I would have told my younger self that there is a better way.<p>The funny thing is ! i know that my younger self would just tell my current self to buzz off cuz a stable job is the way to go, its tried and tested.<p>I guess the lesson learnt is there are alot of things the computer science/engineering degrees dont teach because its not possible to teach these things unless someone has gone through the motions and their own experiences click in.<p>Comp Sci/Eng degrees can give ideas and direction but sometimes at the time you dont see them as ideas, you just see them as a waste of time cause you want to go to the next programming, algorithms or electronics class, not this stupid, project management or business for engineers class ...",1240123888

They also showed me that selling is about focusing your activities on the right things to meet your goals, not just spending time ""busy"" selling.",1240123552

You're right, if it were an academic article I'd never get away with it, but I decided to take a little more leeway with my blog post. I hoped my readers would be astute enough to take my implication of an obviously false causality as tongue in cheek and just appreciate the very cool correlations. You obviously feel differently - I'll try to be more responsible in my future posts.<p>On the topic of financial satisfaction != amount of money, that's very true, and opens the door to all kinds of alternative theories about what causes the correlations. Unfortunately, the salary data included with the GSS isn't very good, so if you want to argue that maybe financially dissatisfied young people are having more sex because of a different confounding variable (they tend to be risk-taking maximizers or something like that), there's not much I can say to argue with you.",1240122498

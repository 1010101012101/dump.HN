3938777,comment,3933631,3934062,2,0,srconstantin,,,"I don't think ""snake oil"" is the right paradigm here. In ML/AI, lots of honest researchers are wrong; being a scientist who's wrong doesn't make you a criminal.<p>That said: Hawkins' principles are very different both from what the brain does, and from what the state of the art in machine learning does. My impression is that HTM's attempt to be too general and assume too little about the problem.<p>For vision in particular, most successful computer vision algorithms (as well as what we know about the visual cortex's mechanisms) make extensive use of information related to the fact that the image <i>is an image.</i>  That is: edges are probably more likely to be continuous than broken; locally constant curvature is more likely than not; textures and colors usually continue over the surface of an object; objects occlude other objects; etc.  Brains and effective computer vision algorithms hard-code a lot of information about the nature of the problem they're solving.  Hawkins wants to bypass that, and I think it's probably too ambitious an aspiration.<p>Then again, if he makes it, more power to him.<p>I don't think we should be prejudiced against someone who comes from the tech industry and wrote a popular book.  It's certainly not ""snake oil"" -- it seems to be a good-faith attempt to solve an important problem.  I think the odds are against it working, but that's not a moral condemnation.",1336395432

3938769,comment,3938566,3938566,10,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yeah I think you missed it. ""Answering this simple question requires knowing everything. The whole execution history of foo. The whole codebase. You name it, you have to keep it in your head.""<p>Here's the thing about OOADP (Note I didn't just use OOP): it gives you a simple methodology to solve problems and know where to put stuff. You don't know <i>everything</i>, because the assumption is that the codebase is going too big to know everything. But what you _do_ know is where things go; an organization of nouns. Good large projects have a design theme that's easy to understand and gives you the mental tools to reason about <i>which pieces</i> need your attention at any one time. OOP is all about working on little pieces at a time and not worrying about knowing everything.<p>It has a lot of problems, but so does every paradigm. I've become a huge functional programming fan over the last couple of years, but I can tell you very frankly that nothing beats OOAD. Nothing. It is a gift from the gods. It allows you to take any problem and make it trivial. Large amounts of wiring will be required.<p>The thing here is that as you start generalizing OOP, you being making this bastard thing that is part OOP and part FP. Or your codebase runs off the rails and becomes a hodgepodge of junk. Or you enter into the ""Kingdom of Nouns"". The ways to screw up are legion.<p>Dependency issues are also a freaking nightmare in OOP. That's why OOP and some sort of TDD go hand-in-hand.<p>I'm mostly with the author, but I don't think he understands the full extent of what he's talking about. OOP (and TDD) is a great tool for large, complex, shared codebases. Even though I'm a huge fan of FP, I remain very skeptical that it can scale well to 100+ developer efforts. I think to truly criticize something like this, you should know both how it's awesome and how it sucks, not just how it sucks.",1336395279

3938751,comment,3936777,3937799,4,0,smackay,,,"This is not as much of a burden as would first appear. The vast majority of Flash files (except those that rely exclusively on actionscript for rendering) are based on as relatively small set of primitives/instructions: place object, move object, show frame, etc. When new features were added typically a new instruction was introduced. Only very rarely was an existing instruction modified for example PlaceObject2 being extended to include optional event handlers for movie clips.<p>A big problem with all things Flash-related is that Adobe was rather half-hearted in its commitment to making Flash open so the documentation was never quite as polished as it could be. Another problem which probably the source of the frustration in the original post is that functionality was added rather than existing code upgraded. That probably meant that the existing code along with all the warts was left untouched rather than run the risk of making breaking changes.<p>The ""interesting stuff like jumps past the end of function"" were I think attempts at obfuscation since decompiling flash files and actipnscript is not very difficult. Another example was to append actionscript byte-codes at the end of a table used for strings and amend the length of the table to hide the code. The following actionscript byte-codes could then add jump into this hidden code which would hopefully but not successfully confuse the decompilers.",1336394980

If you had the chance to work for 20% more being someone who mattered (since they can't shop around), but they had no way to differentiate you from people worth less than 15 dollars an hour (non-coders pretending to be coders), you wouldn't accept an 8-hour ""interview"" doing something small but useful for them for 300 dollars?

Everyone quickly understands that the presence of the posters is a sure sign of the absence of hard work and talent.""</i><p>More on this:<p><i>""Motivational accessories are phony enough to make most people's skin crawl.

3938638,comment,3938566,3938566,16,0,marcusf,,,"I have to say, having stared in to the abyss of large Haskell code bases, they're not necessarily easier to read than a large Java code base.<p>Reading bad functional code can be just as painful as bad OO code -- trying to untangle a mess of fold's that an overzealous developer who just learned of catamorphisms wrote can be painful. Even more so if that young developer is you, five months ago.<p>Sure, the language doesn't impose as much discipline in Python/Java/ as in Haskell(+), so it might require more of you as a developer to write clear, readable code (note: not saying that it requires more of you as a developer in general, just that it's easier to fall in to lazy anti-patterns). But if you work in a decent code base most of the pitfalls in the post are basically straw men. A well designed OO system will generally not be riddled with singletons and arbitrarily mutable state.<p>(+) I'm using Haskell here cause that's the only purely functional language I have any experience with.

3938636,comment,3938230,3938299,1,0,alister,,,"In the spirit of the OP's point about tiny details, I can offer you two reasons why setting DST matters:<p>(1) I want my cats to be fed just before I go to sleep so the cats have the maximal period of full belly when I go to bed. I go to bed at 11:00 pm. Keep in mind that I observe DST changes for myself. But if I never adjust the feeder for standard/daylight time, then either the cats will be hungry until the midnight feeding or they'll be fed an hour early at 10:00 pm. In either case, they are more likely to wake me up for food during the night.<p>(2) The cat feeder is in my bedroom and since I have it set to feed the cats just before bedtime, I don't want it making noise an hour after I fall asleep. That's what would happen when I've switched to daylight time but the feeder hasn't.<p>The point is that there can be legitimate reasons why you'd care about a DST adjustment even if your cats don't.",1336392452

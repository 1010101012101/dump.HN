1171836,comment,1171583,1171583,0,0,fnid2,,,"I recently got embroiled in a dispute over a contract term that I include in all my custom projects.  The clause states explicitly that I own any code that I write and am giving the client a royalty free license to use it forever.<p>This is almost always a sticking point and I explain to them why, which is almost exactly what the linked article states.  Only <i>one</i> time has anyone not agreed to the stipulation, but in that one time, the client went elsewhere.<p>IMO, it's not worth the hassle of going over what I own and what they own and even later when I reuse code from one client's app to another.  I don't want to have to think, ""Can I legally use this code or do I have to rewrite it?""  The headaches, legal troubles and wasted time simply aren't enough to modify what is already codified in U.S. legal statute and supporting court cases.<p>The irony is, if I hadn't included that clause in the contract, explicitly stating what the law says -- that I own whatever code I write, then the client would never have known and everything would have proceeded exactly the same way as if the client had signed a contract without that clause in it.  The clause doesn't change the law, it just says what the law <i>is</i>.<p>So I am considering taking the clause out.  The reason I haven't yet is because I know that if I'm not explicit about it at the beginning, I could have a very angry client on my hands later. It's been argued that it isn't <i>my</i> responsibility to educate my potential clients about the law, but it is my responsibility to create happy clients, or at least not create unhappy clients.",1267897953

They benefit from sharing designs over time, because not only that their machine can print newer design, but their machine also allow them to recycle objects into new and better one. All that is left is the distribution mechanism for raw material, but once you reach a certain amount of material, you can basically transform old objects into new ones at will, barring the need for new raw and rare exotic materials. Perhaps, people who is able to complete a design will be rewarded with especially rare materials for them to experiment with?<p>Now what happen if the patent system is still in effect? That mean every person with a 3D printer is barred from printing designs from a patent of an inventor. In order to make lot of money, he essentially bar the people with 3D printers from printing so that he can sell his invention at the market for really high fees. If he come up with an innovative design for a self-replicating machine, he can  bar the people with 3D printers as well from doing as they like for twenty years. For whatever reason, he rather have the power rather than becoming one of those nobodies in a society where everyone is become wealthier.<p>He can practically stop whole community of inventors who don't use patent and have a totally different idea toward sharing the design of invention.<p>Now imagine an innovative software entrepreneur stopping the open source software community and industry!<p>Patents doesn't need to be frivolous in order to be dangerous to the progress of technology.

It is a language that can be interpreted by the OS and anyone else who is familiar with it.  This is not a skill most people have, and byte code is not English, but it is code nonetheless.  It is not magic, specially sealed, wrapped in a black box.  I may not have your source code, but your source code is just your view of the same program.  Even your source code could have a pretty printer applied to it so that you edit it differently from other developers on your team -- developers who use different syntax highlighting schemes already do this to aid their mental interpretation of the same code language.<p>I am annoyed by usage licenses with the warning against using disassemblers, as if someone has the right to tell you what kind of viewer/editor/OS/program you are allowed to use to translate/interpret the byte language.  They never say, ""You are not allowed to open this in a hex editor or notepad"".  This is an attempt to sell air and trying to seal it with more air, but it also misses the point of the software; it is a misleading and even invalid view of the software's actual value.<p>As someone making money off software, I have never assumed that the software itself held the core value.  The value comes from my trusted name, my continued support, and other things I do for the environment of the software.  It may even come from the software being necessary for something physical to operate (a robot or firmware on a card).  From another perspective, the value is in the physical medium I use to distribute the software so that you can feel more confident in your continued access to it.<p>Keep in mind that while PHP is not compiled, developers at the customer site could alter the PHP code and add value to the application/package that was sold.  They also would have to accept the trade-off: Upgrades get pretty complicated when you mix new code with the local changes.  They also would have to spend time to learn the code and support it.  This tends to be a waste of resources, and thus the advantage remains in the hands of the active producer.<p>The value is not in the libraries I distribute.  The value is in me being able to easily maintain and support the libraries and the constructs built on top of them, that I can construct a software package and environment that people are more willing to invest money in than similar things from my competitors.  If I do that quickly and well, and if I establish trust with my customers, then I will not as easily lose my customer base to someone else.",1267895563

1171756,comment,1171256,1171256,0,0,Perceval,,,"This is a puzzling result for me to read.  As someone who studies international relations theory, the Realist tradition of thinkers (Machiavelli, Hobbes, E.H. Carr, Morgenthau among many others) associate power and consequentialist thinking.  It was stated most clearly by Weber in the <i>Politics as a Vocation</i> lecture, where he contrasts the ethic of responsibility (consequences) to the ethic of conviction (deontological).  Weber's Realism favors an ethic of responsibility against the more idealist thinkers of politics.  E.H. Carr makes a similar distinction between deontological idealism and consequentialist Realism in his classic <i>The Twenty Years Crisis</i>.<p>This fits in with the tradition of Realism, going back the Machiavelli, who argued against <i>actually</i> following moral rules, but instead maintaining the <i>appearance</i> of following moral rules.  He also links power, the use of power, the gaining of power, and the maintenance of power to a willingness to abandon moral rules.  It was will and <i>virtú</i> that determined the prince's effectiveness in the face of <i>fortuna</i>.<p>Hobbes is probably the most interesting thinker on the topic of the link between power and morality.  He makes very explicit the link between epistemology (what we can claim we know) and authority and force.  In order to avoid the kind of civil wars he saw around him when writing <i>The Leviathan</i> (the Thirty Years War and the English Civil War), he thought that the ability to make claims about truth/revelation/values/morality had to be circumscribed from the public sphere.  The ability to resolve disputes about moral knowledge had to be located in a single figure, the sovereign, who possessed authority and the power to back it up.  But Hobbes is not making a descriptive argument--he's not saying that the powerful follow moral rules deontologically.  He's making a normative argument--that only the powerful sovereign can make moral decisions for the public, because if <i>anyone</i> can make deontological claims what results is the type of religious civil war that he saw all around him.<p>So, for most of the tradition of Western (realist) thought, the relationship between power and morality/consequences runs the opposite way.  The powerful operate (or should operate) according to consequences, not to deontological rules.  The idealists--the ""unarmed prophets"" in the words of Machiavelli--operate on deontological rules and end up being ineffective, overthrown, or conquered.",1267894883

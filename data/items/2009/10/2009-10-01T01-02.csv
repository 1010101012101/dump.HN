I'm not interested in the same things other people my age.<p>I have taken a project from initial phases through completion... when I was in high school. I even got a law firm to do the legal stuff pro Bono.<p>I'm not riding on being accepted to work on this. I'm just saying it would be a really good if I do get accepted. It would make it a lot easier for me. I still plan on working on it if I'm not accepted, just as I have done for countless previous projects from before I knew what a startup was.<p>I'm not getting much in return for the almost 20000 per year I spend on college (and I'm just not built to be <i>told</i> what to learn) and to be able to not only stop paying 20000 per year in pursuit of a degree to get a job I won't want (I will be self employed; no way I will be able to work for someone for more than a summer), but to be paid almost 20000 to do that, that sir is as ideal as it can get.<p>That is why it's a no-brainer for me to apply.",1254362276

854124,comment,853287,853839,0,0,thwarted,,,"I don't know why so many people consider this to be a ""dirty hack"".  It makes total sense to overload ErrorDocument and generate the missing content.  You get really good efficiency in the common case of the document existing because it is in the filesystem and execution never leaves apache core to run a CGI except in the exceptional case of having to generate it (depending on your usage patterns, of course).<p>This is even documented in the apache docs, albeit with rewrite rules, which is more heavyweight and less efficient.

I believe that using ErrorDocument for this purpose is explicitly mentioned somewhere in the apache docs, but I can't find it right now.  I'm pretty sure that' where I first learned of it (maybe back in the 1.3 days).<p>I have a feeling that if ErrorDocument had been named (or aliased to) GenerateMissingContent, then this would be a widely accepted method of dynamic on the fly generation with filesystem caching.  I've even heard a rationale that having a script generate the content on error and write it into the filesystem where apache can then read it directly on later requests is reimplementing a reverse caching proxy, and you should just stick squid in front of your web servers (with the, ahem, additional overhead of having to run and mange two services).  This seems like significant effort of trying to avoid something that has ""error"" in the name for non-error cases.",1254360233

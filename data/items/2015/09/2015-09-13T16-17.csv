He&#x27;s saying it to the so-called experts who posted nonsense like this:<p>&quot;Yeah... Gaffer is well-known as a guide, but also kind of horribly flawed. Question 1 for networking development:
Do you need everything that TCP offers?
If yes, then use TCP. You&#x27;re not going to outperform TCP to do what it&#x27;s good at.
If not, read on.&quot;<p>This was a gilded +20 comment in the thread despite a) being nonsense and b) having the temerity to call his advice &#x27;horribly flawed.&#x27; He <i>is</i> an expert with multiple shipped AAA games. <i>And</i> he prefixed his rant with RANT MODE ON.

When I do ride around cars, I can never maintain a good pace.  I&#x27;m constantly stopping for intersections.<p>On the other hand, when I&#x27;m on a trail, The anxiety of contending with cars is gone, and I can keep a high pace for much longer.<p>The best is mountain biking on single track.

10211973,comment,10210685,10210685,0,0,jokoon,,,"TCP is suitable for &quot;flat&quot; static content, which you only retrieve at punctual intervals, and is relatively large. A good example is a file which won&#x27;t change for the next 5 min, and you know that you want that exact file BUT you are ready to wait until it loads perfectly.<p>UDP is for real time, continuous data, when you can&#x27;t wait for your hardware to check for packet consistency.<p>A good example is paper mail versus a telephone call. The paper mail will land, but you don&#x27;t care if your phone line cuts for 1 second. You just wait for the other guy to check if he can hear you<p>UDP is really much better when you want to have performance, especially when it comes to responsiveness and latency, but can afford to discard packets if they&#x27;re not reliable.<p>I think it boils down to people not realizing how hard it is to transmit data over long distances, and that the protocol don&#x27;t consider that data transmission is 100% good, because it never is. You can have a lot of interference in your network, but TCP will always manage to land those packets.",1442163574

White people hold incredible advantages in modern society. Especially white men. When people ask you to express empathy & are bitterly frustrated when most refuse, they lash out. But that lashing shouldn&#x27;t be surprising.<p>One need only look at how the police would treat you if you ran from them vs. the many highly publicized (but hardly unique or isolated) cases where police officers acted outrageously against people of color in the US.<p>> The pendulum swings one way for a little while, then it swings the other way.<p>Sorry, but this is wrong. The world is consistently more progressive and permissive over time. We certainly have had major reversals of this in history, but these never recover to quite the same level of conservatism.<p>And quite frankly, we all have agency in this. We can change the world for the better, if we act in concert. The sum of individual actions is our society, and the sum of societal actions is the arc of history. So stop acting like it&#x27;s inevitable.",1442163488

10211969,comment,10210508,10210508,0,0,antigen8,,,"Update:<p>Thank-you to everyone responding, especially those who are helping enormously by giving me real-talk; Here&#x27;s some more information about my situtation:<p>The legacy system I referred to has limitations that make it very uncomfortable to contemplate continuing to use it as our sole data source. Some issues: 
- The database is updated once a day; Any changes you add to it today won&#x27;t show until tomorrow.
- Student absences (important so we can see cutting, lateness, etc) can be recorded once per day; students are either &quot;at school&quot; or not.
- There are numerous categories of data that we have that can&#x27;t be tracked or stored, for expample, whether a student is involved in a sports team. We have a large body of instructional data about how students are doing in class, but we&#x27;re struggling to bring it together to get a full picture because as far as our main system is concerned, students receive a grade at the end of their course for their transcript, and that&#x27;s that.<p>I&#x27;m not going to ignore what I&#x27;m being told and I think that building a new solution is beyond our capacity; we have to keep our focus on teaching the kids as well as we can. But we have a very young staff and an administration committed to exploring our options. I&#x27;ve already been looking at Tableau and it&#x27;s so powerful and approachable that we can definitely use it. The difficulty I now face is what tool can we use to complement and expand the system that&#x27;s causing a lot of grief.<p>We need to be able to store types of information including absences, student biographical info, grades; we want to be able to store student ID pictures, lesson plans, notes from teachers. Points of contact with parents. What we think we know is that we need a SaaS solution, we have regulatory compliance issues (not to mention ethical requirements) around security and privacy of our data, which many of you noticed.<p>I&#x27;m reading every single comment and will respond by email and here where it makes sense. We know we need help even to understand our problem.
YC 2016 would be top of my priorities right now, but there are ethics rules preventing me from being a vendor to any NYC public school while I&#x27;m working at one. As much as it makes sense ethically, it really seems like that shouldn&#x27;t be the department&#x27;s focus when they have kids who can&#x27;t read yet and they can&#x27;t tell you which kids they are.",1442163370

Type 054A frigates are multirole warships and have been deployed for anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden since 2009. Also, among other tasks, in January 2014, a ship of the same class was sent to escort Syrian chemical weapons destined for destruction. The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) currently has 18 Type 054A frigates in service. The third Chinese vessel to participate in Joint Sea 2015 was the Type 903 replenishment ship Weishanhu.&quot;[1]<p>Ok, it was two frigates instead of a cruiser, but still...<p><i>or a Chinese aircraft carrier off Greenland</i>.

Cyclists in particular often have lower back problems from sitting with their back in a weird position for long periods of time. That&#x27;s not to say they aren&#x27;t good forms of exercise, but it is also good to get some sort of impact based exercise as well (like running or walking). Of course too much running is probably bad for your joints and anecdotally I know a lot of older runners with chronic injuries, so it&#x27;s tough to strike the right balance.",1442163352
10211966,comment,10211595,10211595,0,0,ClintEhrlich,,,"I submitted this piece to HN because it exemplifies how useful falsehoods can permeate a free society. We laugh at North Korean propaganda, and rightly so. But if a well informed Russian watched <i>Thirteen Days</i>, I&#x27;m sure he would find it a laugh-inducing example of American nationalist indoctrination.<p>All of us think we know the story, but few Americans have ever had occasion to consider some basic questions, such as: Why was it acceptable for America to place nuclear missiles near Russia, but not for Russia to respond by placing nuclear missiles near America?<p>The Cuban Missile Crisis also offers a humbling illustration of how American democracy rarely passes accurate judgment on the performance of the president. No matter how many justifications or excuses one makes for Kennedy&#x27;s choices, there remains one inescapable fact: He brought the world as close to nuclear annihilation as it has ever come.<p>The successful &quot;quarantine&quot; that hagiographies of J.F.K. recount as his greatest diplomatic achievement almost destroyed the world, when American destroyers began dropping depth charges near a Soviet submarine in international waters. The submarine&#x27;s captain ordered the launch of a nuclear torpedo, and his decision was affirmed by the sub&#x27;s political officer — which normally would be enough to authorize the use of a nuclear weapon.<p>Why wasn&#x27;t the world transformed into a sphere of radioactive ice? Pure Serendipity. The commander of the Soviet flotilla happened to be present on the submarine, and he was able to convince his comrades to stand down.<p>Thus, the man we owe our lives to is not Kennedy, our national icon, but rather a guy named Василий Архипов, whom most Americans will never hear about. I named my cat &quot;Vasili&quot; in his honor.<p>Sometimes, when I&#x27;m petting him, I think about the constant gulf between perception and reality that I have witnessed firsthand. How often do we think that the right people receive credit or blame when software breaks or corporations implode? Why would we expect verism to prevail in even higher stakes domains, like world history?<p>I stand by what I wrote a couple years ago: &quot;[T]he highest entropy fields are also the ones with the highest stakes for society. For example, what were the consequences of American intervention against the Central Powers in World War I? They are difficult to fathom precisely because they were so immense. The problem is a combination of &#x27;causal density&#x27; and &#x27;holistic integration.&#x27; The more variables a decision affects, the harder it is to untangle the resulting chain of cause and effect. And if its consequences are far reaching, then there is rarely an opportunity to perform controlled experiments.<p>Thus, the experts who offer opinions about the momentous issues of our times are precisely those in whom we should have the least confidence. Their fields may appear prestigious because they involve matters of global importance, but there is a corollary decrease in  the reliability of their insights.&quot;",1442163351

Every single one of them has had problems with their knees, ankles, hips, tendons, etc. A couple of surgeries here and there too.<p>Swimming gets points for having a lower risk of injury, but OTOH, running is good for bone density which can help avoid injuries down the road.<p>Were your relatives competitive runners who trained hard for races? I think injuries are much less common in casual runners who rarely train to exhaustion, and never try to power through oncoming conditions like shin splints.",1442163302

I&#x27;m Polish, and just because I&#x27;m white doesn&#x27;t mean I have the world handed to me.

You read that the US put nuclear missiles next to Russia, missiles that were visible to the entire world including Russia, aboveground, missiles which are vulnerable and can be destroyed in a first-strike, missiles that are therefore useless as a deterrent, and only useful as a first-strike weapon. Combined with ridiculous levels of paranoia and threats against the USSR and Cuba, and the invasion of Cuba, assassination attacks and constant provocations, and that this fuelled the Soviet&#x27;s interest in positioning something similar in Cuba, and Cuba&#x27;s interest in having some kind of deterrence to the multiple acts of aggression including a full-scale invasion. You already read that the USSR suggested and agreed to a peaceful missile trade that eventually happened, and that this was a reasonable course of action from the get-go, without the necessity of a confrontation which was fuelled by JFK&#x27;s actions in the first place. And you also read that instead they forced a confrontation regardless, a confrontation that put half the world on the brink of destruction. How can you still not think Kennedy caused the confrontation/crisis? Not only did he cause it, but he also made sure not to avoid such a risky confrontation when it wasn&#x27;t strategically necessary.<p>As for &#x27;Kennedy shouldn&#x27;t have opposed that&#x27;, the article touches on it when it quotes Kennedy as saying he shouldn&#x27;t have said the soviets couldn&#x27;t have those missiles a few weeks earlier, and infers he now has to stick with it for domestic consumption because he&#x27;d be flip-flopping, not good after already being humiliated on Cuba, after running a campaign partially driven by hawkish views on Cuba. So Kennedy agrees with you that it makes no sense, and the article touches on the fact the Soviet position made sense, and that the European position disagreed with Kennedy, and that his own staff told him the threat wasn&#x27;t significant, and the article also touches on the fact the Kennedies wanted to keep this a secret because it was a political, not a strategic move, and so part of his staff was kept in the dark (even the VC), part of the white house lied to congress, they pressured the Soviets to keep it in the dark and even went so far as to retrieve a letter that would expose it all if it was ever leaked, that tells you a lot.",1442161953

OK so on paper we should roll the landing craft and tanks in, but you have nukes so you get a free pass, we&#x27;ll harass the heck out of you but keep the weapons that directly impact us out of sight and we&#x27;ll not fight back too hard.  There is also some face saving going on that sure there are plenty of leftist orgs with weapons that suspiciously happen to be all from your factories but we can kind of plausibly deny based on plenty of western rifles and even local factory production.  But it goes too far WRT saving face to take over and four years later emplace Russian missiles and nukes... we can turn a blind eye to generic infantry rifles but the missiles are a step too far.<p>Another way to look at it is confusion about the borders of the Munroe Doctrine.  When it was written the US didn&#x27;t have hundreds of military bases around the world full of troops and we just did two world wars and we&#x27;re fighting brushfire conflicts all over the planet.  Suddenly partitioning the globe by hemisphere into ours and theirs and never the two shall meet doesn&#x27;t seem so fair or realistic.  So newly negotiated result of the post crisis Munroe Doctrine is the Russians can do behind the scene and adviser stuff right up to our borders, but strategic weapons were a step too far at that time (although it would have been more fair to let them do in Cuba what we did in Turkey, that was just too big of a step at that time)<p>Now debating the sanity or wisdom or ethics of the Munroe Doctrine is a whole nother kettle of fish, but given it, there are some interpretations based on it that shouldn&#x27;t be missed.  Pre-crisis, this is our hemisphere, keep out, because we don&#x27;t get involved in foreign entanglements.  Post-crisis, well, yeah, we get into all kinds of foreign entanglements and the new line in the sand is no permanently emplaced strategic weapons in our hemisphere, fair or right or not, its the new line in the sand and the other guys agreed to it.",1442161637

10211806,comment,10207952,10210679,0,0,jonsterling,,,"I agree that each ML falls short in some ways--I think SML and OCaml are probably the best programming languages ever made, but there&#x27;s definitely room for improvement. I dream of the &quot;Next Great ML&quot;; 1ML definitely looks interesting in this regard, though I am a bit skeptical of Rossberg&#x27;s rhetoric on a number of issues.<p>I use SML over OCaml mostly for cultural & political reasons; SML has a few areas ripe for improvement (some of which are addressed in OCaml, others not):<p>1. structure sharing in the Definition is so bad that pretty much all the implementations of &quot;S&quot;ML diverge from it in some way. Each implementation of structure sharing is frustrating in its own way.<p>2. would be nice to be able to do higher-kinded polymorphism, as in 1ML<p>3. would be nice to unify polymorphism as a mere mode-of-use of functors, as in 1ML (well, this was not invented in 1ML, as I first saw it in Dreyer/Harper/Chakravarty&#x27;s &quot;Modular Type Classes&quot;: <a href=""http://www.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/papers/mtc/main-long.pdf;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/papers/mtc/main-long.pdf;</a> it may go back as far as the Harper-Stone type theoretic semantics). Combined with higher-order functors (which I believe are proposed to be added to &quot;Successor ML&quot;), this would give a proper treatment to polymorphism at higher kinds.<p>4. we need to standardize on a package calculus; the ML Basis system as used in Mlton is pretty nice, as is the simpler system used in SML/NJ&#x27;s &quot;Compilation Manager&quot;.<p>5. modular type classes (analogous to coq&#x27;s &quot;canonical structures&quot;) should be added in order to alleviate the pain of explicitly instantiating functors, etc. We do <i>NOT</i> want &quot;type class coherence&quot; as in Haskell, which amounts to a piece of global state that essentially outlaws local reasoning. I call it the &quot;Antimodularity Restriction&quot;, but the name hasn&#x27;t caught on, as much as Haskell folks like to berate us over our &quot;value restriction&quot; (which is a non-problem, and very useful--though it would be better to reconstruct it in a less ad-hoc way, via the theory of polarization that comes from Girard, and was further developed in light of effects, refinements and polymorphism by Zeilberger in his dissertation).<p>6. I&#x27;d like to (at least) follow OCaml and add the ability to convert between module signatures & existential types; I&#x27;m not sure if I am sold on the 1ML approach, which goes quite a bit further than this, but I need to investigate it more.<p>7. Refinement types would be nice (but PLEASE---do not fix in advance some awful solver or something for this; contra the popular literature at the moment refinement types have <i>NOTHING</i> at all to do with solvers!).",1442160375

Aside from the Canvas tag there is no good way to do graphics with JavaScript (at least no simple way that isn't a bunch of arcane HTML tricks which wouldn't make any sense to a beginner).<p>And, if you're using the Canvas tag you're excluding IE users.  If you're only going to reach a limited audience anyway, why not use Flash and reach a much <i>bigger</i> limited audience?<p>On the other hand, I guess Canvas teaches you about drawing to buffers, while Flash teaches you about more abstract things.",1204034354

123845,comment,123693,123785,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Most games nowadays use a two-tiered architecture: they write the graphics, rendering, collision-detection, and other processor-intensive parts as C libraries, and then do the game mechanics, AI, physics, and other highly-changeable parts in an interpreted scripting language.  That way, they get the maintenance advantages of a high-level language without paying the speed penalty.<p>Also, many people don't realize just how much faster computers are now than they were 10 years ago.  As part of the prototyping for my startup, I wrote a couple games in <i>JavaScript</i>, which is roughly 1000 times slower than C.  They were generally quite playable, except on Firefox/X-windows where an odd Canvas bug seems to be adding a lot of latency without pegging the CPU.  I'd still use Flash if I were doing a production game (JavaScript's timing is inconsistent, with occasional long pauses presumably for garbage collection), but as long as you stick to 2D it's quite feasible to do games entirely in interpreted languages.",1204033081

123838,comment,123254,123701,0,0,halo,,,"The 'problem' with Perl's type indicators are that it's slightly unintuitive to, say, create a hash using %, but to access a hash (and return a variable) you use $, so the punctuation indicates the return type rather than the type you are accessing and might not make sense without context. Whatsmore, it requires you to remember two things - the type of brackets required and the return type, one of which is largely redundant.<p>Incidentally, I'm pretty sure they're changing this with Perl 6 and making it to that the symbol indicates the type you are accessing. I'm split as to whether this is a good idea or not, especially as they're retaining the still largely redundant curly brackets when ordinary brackets will now do.",1204030980

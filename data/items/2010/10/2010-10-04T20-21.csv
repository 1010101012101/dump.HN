Though I think that's a little bit stupid for a name.<p>Apple does warn developers from making NSStatusItem's/Menu Bar Extra's:  <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGMenus/XHIGMenus.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000356-CHDFJEAC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserEx...</a><p>However, they tend to be more robust for certain applications than a Dock icon or Dock Icon Menu's. You can have clickable buttons, have single- and double-click behavior, display graphics, etc...<p>On a downside, if you don't have enough screen space to show them, they'll start to disappear. They are ordered based on which app loaded theirs first and cannot be re-ordered.<p>--------------------<p>Apple's ""Menu Bar Extras"" don't exist within NSStatusBar. These include the clock, battery icon, bluetooth icon, etc... They live in a private API of Apple's.<p>Apple's always appear on the far-right, are the last to ""disappear"" if there's not enough space for them to fit. Unlike 3rd party NSStatusItem's, you can re-position Apple's by Control-Clicking on them and moving them around (except for Spotlight's).<p>--------------------<p>Since 3rd party NSStatusItem's are not going away anytime soon, there's a need for a Mac app (or OS X update) that'll let you condense them into some sort of manageable GUI element.<p>All NSStatusItems appear under a single instance of NSStatusBar. It would be possible to write an app that'll extend NSStatusBar's class (overriding it, swizzle it, etc...) which would allow you to do custom stuff with them. Perhaps add ordering support, hiding support, grouping them inside a mini-window accessible by a single ""Menu Bar Extra"" you click to access them.<p>For example (excuse the crappiness - I mocked it up in 5 min, credit goes to Snippit for the window graphic):<p><a href=""http://www.dave-gallagher.net/coding/menuBarMockup.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dave-gallagher.net/coding/menuBarMockup.jpg</a><p>It would be nice to add ""lesser-used"" Menu Bar Extra's to something like that, hiding them out of the way.",1286225514

1757315,comment,1755748,1756932,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"<i>I'm assuming that by 'fundamentally different' you mean something which is naturally a positive liberty in your view, represented (presumably disingenuously in your opinion) as a negative liberty. I don't see how this distinction can be made however.</i><p>No, you're not getting the difference between positive and negative -- possibly I'm doing a poor job of explaining. Let me try one more time, and include a reference for further explanation.<p>A negative liberty is enjoyed when I'm free of external limitations. I am <i>allowed</i> to do whatever I am able. The Bill of Rights is full of this stuff: free speech, freedom from seizure of property; etc.<p>A positive liberty is enjoyed when someone empowers me to be able to do something. The health care debate hinges on the idea that society (by way of the gov't) must give healthcare to all who need it. You'll note here the critical element of an external agent providing the positive liberty.<p>If I'm alone on a desert island, I have infinite negative liberty. However, positive liberties are quite impossible since there's no agent to enable me.<p>For further discussion, see this Wikipedia article:
<a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Liberty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Liberty</a><p><i>Individualist and classical liberal conceptions of liberty relate to the freedom of the individual from outside compulsion or coercion and this is defined as negative liberty. Social liberal conceptions of liberty relate freedom to social structure and agency and this is defined as positive liberty.</i><p>The slavery example is not a counter-argument. The fact that someone who had been using you unjustly is now forced to mend his ways does not force us to look at something as a positive liberty -- else <i>everything</i> would be. Two centuries ago there were a lot of people doing something very evil. Damaging their livelihood by recognizing their victim's rights was only the transient consequence of righting the wrong, and is of no significance today. I have no obligation placed on me by the recognition that all my fellow humans own their own bodies. <i>That</i> is the crucial distinction.<p>The fact that an external agent -- the other people in society -- must provide your positive liberty creates the odd condition in the healthcare question. Abstractly, I'm entitled to <i>some</i> healthcare, but the amount to which I'm entitled is fundamentally variable because the resources available to provide it are variable. One can imagine that I'm in the middle of a cancer treatment that I'd been ""entitled to"" when the stock market crashes and gov't tax revenue falls dramatically. With less money in the budget, the thresholds for what care can be provided must be shifted, and now I'm told that I'm no longer entitled to that expensive treatment. I have trouble accepting a moral code in which the difference between right and wrong (what we are morally obligated to provide to someone, in this case) can change with the business cycle and even with fashion.<p>As an aside, the question of slavery is an extreme example here, but there is a conjunction. In the presence of positive liberty, the person claiming the liberty is indirectly claiming ownership of me (in a small degree). They assert that I must work in order to earn the resources that will enable their liberty (that is, I must pay into a fund so that they can get healthcare). In this way, positive liberties are directly destrictive of negative liberties.",1286224836

We the people demand an end to X!' However, 'we the people', when taken as a whole, have a demonstrable tendency to disagree amongst ourselves, and almost never act in concert. There are all sorts of thing which we should find surprising or unacceptable within our own homes but whose existence we accept or at least tolerate within our county, state, or country because either a majority of our neighbors hold views which differ from ours or because constitutional or legislative power takes precedence over our own preferences.<p>A better analogy might be to consider the country as something similar to an apartment building or even a small town.You can exert a degree of security insofar as it serves the common good, but an absolutist approach of the kind you describe rapidly becomes self-defeating and unsustainable over the longer term. I might add that absolutism in this context refers to the idea of abolishing borders as much as to the idea of sealing them. After all, we have controls in between the borders of US states with limited powers to enforce prohibitions or requirements unique to that state, from carrying certain produce to wearing a motorcycle helmet, and these are not considered especially onerous.<p>Rather than abolition of borders, I see a trend away from a presumption of exclusion as the default and towards a policy of neutral vigilance - in other words, personal migration will come to be seen in the same light as other trade flows, subject to inspection and monitoring but requiring specific grounds for interference.<p>So, suppose you have a business importing silk from China, and the hacky part is that it's woven in conformity with 6502 assembler code or something. It comes into the US in a cargo container, and we all accept that DHS/CBP want to assure themselves that it doesn't include radioactive materials, smallpox, or marauding silkworm colonies. That done, we expect them to be indifferent to the question of whether 8-bit silken handkerchief designs will affect the US economy in positive or negative fashion - that's for the market to discover, not the customs inspectors, as long as there's no ongoing trade dispute between China and the US justifying their exclusion in accordance with treaty.<p>We already have such a policy in place for visiting tourists and businesspersons from other developed countries, and which is mostly reciprocal - you can grab your passport and fly to Japan on a whim for up to 90 days, and vice versa. Within both the US and the EU, the benefits of allowing migration between the individual member states seems to considerably outweigh the various costs; economics suggests that rational policymaking on international migration will go the same way sooner or later.<p>Of course, this isn't foolproof and the downside of such a policy is that criminals can exploit such openness to further their wicked ends. But insofar the number of such people/incidents is low - not least because more people appreciate the freedoms of the open model, and have a stake in its preservation - that risk is tolerable.",1286224351

Many are overly verbose.<p>I've definitely enjoyed a few though, Django's being one of them.<p>I think Javascript templating is great, and it's certainly helpful in many ways, but it could never flat-out replace server-side template engines for me. In Django for example, you almost always pass whole ORM objects to the template. On someone's page of a list of friends, I'd loop through a collection of User objects and generate an html list of usernames and permalinks to their profile pages. If I passed the whole collection of User objects to the client they'd get access to a lot of sensitive information. Which would require me to white-list at the ORM level exactly what fields I might need ahead of time. That might work, but I'd always be worried that I didn't clean the objects sent to the client's JS template enough for every page I'm writing.<p>Unless of course you were going for the idea that we'll be using one universal templating language both for the front-end JS as well as on the back-end in something like node.

You believe ""God"" to refer to some specific thing, and it is that thing that you choose not to believe in. Whatever that is, I don't know, but if you assume that the word ""God"" has a clear and singular definition, well, then you don't know very much about religion, do you? :-)<p>But that doesn't seem to be the case, it just sounds like you might be a little confused, as in your last sentence, you demonstrate an understanding that there are in fact multiple definitions for the word ""god"".<p>So, what is atheism then, really? Wikipedia gives the following definition:<p><pre><code>  Atheism, in a broad sense, is the rejection of belief in the existence of 
  deities.[1] In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there 
  are no deities.[2] Most inclusively, atheism is simply the absence of belief that
  any deities exist.[3] 
</code></pre>
We must then investigate further, because this definition begs the question of what is meant by the word ""deity"". A click and we get this definition:<p><pre><code>  A deity[1] is a postulated preternatural or supernatural immortal being, who may 
  be thought of as holy, divine, or sacred, held in high regard, and respected by
  believers, often religiously referred to as a god.
</code></pre>
Here I think the relevant word is not ""immortal"", for there may in fact be something that is immortal (the universe is immortal), but rather ""preternatural"" and ""supernatural"".<p>And that is were the crux is. For the mystics do not believe that God is supernatural or ""preternatural"". This is not the notion of God as understood in Hinduism or Buddhism, for example. In those religions, God <i>is</i> natural. God <i>is</i> nature.<p>So, if you identify as an atheist, and by that you mean you disbelieve in a God that is outside of nature, then I think that is just fine (and fairly unremarkable), but if you disbelieve also in the second type of God, the one who is one with nature, then that is another thing entirely. You may in fact believe in God, but you just might not have known about the various meanings of that word.",1286223951

As our founders made clear when declaring our independence, it is a self-evident truth ""that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.""<p>That we continue to have, as a people, the natural right and ability as protected by the second amendment to abolish our government when we see fit, is (to me) evidence that our founders chose well.  That is not to say, of course, that their choice of government will always be the right one for us.<p><i>I'd prefer a lot more decisionmaking to happen at local levels and state levels in the USA, which gives people more options for where they want to live and the kind of government they wish to live under.</i><p>I agree, and this is the reason for my comment on abuse of the commerce clause.  The states, and their localities as they see fit, have complete control over their governance <i>except</i> where contradicted by federal treaty and law in pursuance of the constitution.  Unfortunately, through the commerce clause the federal legislature, with precious few rebuttals from SCOTUS, has long managed to interfere in purely intrastate concerns.<p><i>Large scale, broad legislation almost always winds up with devil's bargains that don't quite suit anyone really well, special interests working in coalitions...</i><p>Yes, agreed.  The constitution makes it clear where authority really lies - but short of SCOTUS revisiting their commerce clause rulings, we'll have to effect this change on the soap box and at the ballot box, by finding, supporting and electing national representatives who want to govern us the least.",1286223691

1757134,comment,1718369,1718369,0,0,scronin,,,"Vancouver suffers from many problems but one really big one kills startups.  Primarily, risk adversity is a common trait in investors and founders here.  The Lean/MVP model does not lend itself to building BIG companies because its a bit (not totally) absurd to think that a company that needs 10-30 MIT gold standard engineers to conceive can be bootstrapped.  Talking about the ""startup scene"" is a waste of time until real efforts are put together to make real companies that solve hard enterprise class problems or uncover 2-5 year forward looking, undeveloped markets.<p>In America, as pointed out time and again by the upper echelon in the Vancouver startup circles, people actually take these forward looking risks because the payoff is just too sweet if it comes through.  Bootup is notable for pushing the boulder up the hill, Danny R and Co. are a scrappy fighters thats for sure.<p>For instance, even a SR&ED/IRAP intensive startup with a potential BIG idea (which is a stunning program @fiveo from the standpoint of the unemotional-observational economist) meets the common phrases that investors in Vancouver rely on to skate away.  ""its too early""  ""i need to see a working prototype making profit with tons of traction"" ""its not scalable"".  And kudos to them, they worked damn hard to build a life(style) here and don't want to burn their precious money into cinders.<p>As a proven and skilled technician, I can say that I have met many talented PhD's and engineers in Vancouver, now in Palo Alto.  Someone with 2-5 years success in technology is worth about 90k a year, and that wage is nigh unachievable in B.C.  Too often we leave for the states, myself included, because their are too many tagalongs who don't actually understand the minutiae involved in how specific technologies create value across international markets.  Too many evangelists and mentors, not enough mature engineers who work with tenacity, intensity ,focus and audacity.<p>Perhaps this type of discussion can be better studied by a thought experiment.  How would you start a company like the awesome Palantir Inc in Vancouver?  Give us a thoughtful, unbiased analysis that spells out to investors the reduction of risk and the chance to make a 10X exit in a <i>tough</i> <i>hostile</i> and <i>messy</i> business environment.

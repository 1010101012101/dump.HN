Granted, the last few may actually be standards compliant, but dealing with the 25 intermediate stages that aren't would be the seventh circle of development hell. Even though conditional stylesheets means you wouldn't have to rely on CSS selector hacks, that would make QA an order of magnitude more onerous than it already is.<p>I guess it's a chicken-and-egg problem, they aren't compliant because they don't develop iteratively, and they can't iterate often until they're more compliant unless they want to saddle everyone with a dozen inconsistently non-compliant browser versions. Even if they tried, all but the very largest web properties probably wouldn't QA for all versions of the browser. The drop in IE support from websites would result in a worse experience for their users.",1269449982

They look at <i>lots</i> of things.<p>Before the SAT changes in 1994 that made them worthless, they found that class ranking was strangely enough one of the best predictors of future success (MIT does longitudinal study of the admissions and resulting success of failure, the number one imperative is to accept <i>no one</i> who they don't think can do the work (which is a pretty high bar for MIT, with it's core math and science requirements)).<p>And, yeah, having an almost published paper probably  helped me (I sent the original draft with a note that half the results were unusable due to a contaminated culture that was only discovered after the work).  Plus a well designed (structured programming) program (this was back in 1979).<p>My SAT (very high verbal, OK but not so much for MIT math) and class standing weren't too great, but they correctly said yes.  My friend said that being from deep in flyover country certainly made a difference in terms of a desire for geographic diversity.<p>Anyway, a bottom line today for MIT is that if you can do the work, you have a raw 1/3 chance of acceptance (self-selection of applications is <i>fierce</i>).<p>The very most important thing you can do is to demonstrate to them that you're a ""go-getter"", the sort of person who naturally does projects and the like.

While many took the route of going through the school, I chose to find my own which paid triple that of the average paid intern through the school program and obviously much better than unpaid--not to mention my experience seemed to have been better as most other interns complained about doing ""grunt work"".<p>---GOVERNMENT OBSERVATION---\nIt is our choice to make and shouldn't have the government mettle in this type of affair.  Take a look at what happened in New York circa 1902 when government went to far into labor laws and practices: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York</a><p>Regarding the above, basically, New York State law was passed in 1897 stating ""No employee shall be required or permitted to work in a biscuit, cake, or break bakery or confectionary establishment"" for more than 10 hours per day.\nWhat?\nLochner was a baker and he was fined for allowing employees to work more than 10 hours a day or ""violating the state law limiting the number of hours his employees could work.""<p>The government of New York tried to justify this ridiculous law by saying it was to protect the health, safety, morality and welfare of bakers in New York.<p>Thankfully, the Supreme Court sided with Lochner that the New York State law was unconstitutional, although their reasoning is a little poor. Unfortunately, the Lochner law was reversed in 1937 under the guise of upholding a Washington State law setting minimum wage.<p>Like anything, freedom and restrictions and governing can be abused, and anyone can argue either side of the situation easily, but it is the choice of the people to side with our natural rights as citizens, including our right ""to be free in his person and in his power to contract in relation to his labor.""",1269447453

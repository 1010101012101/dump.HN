They appear to have given up on something extremely useful that achieved it's apex during  Deja's tenure.",1245588909
667356,comment,667319,667319,0,0,MoeDrippins,,,"Depending on what you mean exactly by ""in the past"", part of the issue is the people that had usenet available to them at a given point in time.  Early on, it was the rare individual that could get access to it <i>at all</i>, and those that could were the geeky nerdy guys (I count myself among those, by the way, just not as smart), and the ones that even WANTED to if they could were the elite of that small group.<p>Too, there simply WAS no such thing as SPAM (as we know it now) then.<p>So what you see now is largely an artifact of the ubiquity of access.<p>IMO.",1245588676

I just finished my B.S. in Information Sciences & Technology - Information Systems Development with two minors; Computer Science and Business Administration from Penn State University.<p>My goal is to obtain a software development position; specifically Web Development.  I have several years of internship experience starting back as early as my junior year of high school.  My most recent employment has been with my own software company that I founded, RADO Consulting LLC.  I worked and developed the company while attending college.  But I never had enough time to grow the company beyond doing simple, one-off website projects for small, local companies.  I think at this point the best career move would be to take a position with another development company where I can work with more experienced developers; learning and improving my development skills.<p>So my dilemma is that I can’t seem to find a job.  I’ve had one interview in 4 months and no other leads.  I’m beginning to think that maybe my resume needs some work and that I might even hire a professional to write my resume for me.  Has anyone had success with doing such a thing?  Monster.com offers a service, although somewhat pricey, it seems to be very professional and of high quality.  I found a few other companies that offer the service, but nothing that really impressed me.  What are your thoughts?",1245587418

It's probably spread out amongst various forums and blogs these days.

I have also come to  disagree with the specific PG essay mentioned in the post.<p>Entrepreneurship needs to be more sustainable than what is made out in the current literature. It shouldn't really be a 2 year binge in the hope of a cashout. The biggest companies take a lot more than that and if you really love doing it there is no reason you should be looking for an exit. A long term commitment also requires entrepreneurship to suit your other life requirements.<p>A startup isn't really worth its exit.",1245585865

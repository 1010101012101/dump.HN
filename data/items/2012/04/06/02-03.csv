Otherwise, your critics would have said something rather than just downvoting you.<p>Your problem seems to be that you haven't considered the possibility that academia is even worse.  Academia is even worse.  (I dropped out of the Berkeley PhD program in 1992 - specialty, OS and languages.  From what I can tell, academia has only gotten worse since then.)<p>I could produce a parallel list of bullet points, but I'll just say three things.  The only reason to go to grad school is because you want to be a professor.  The only reason to be a professor is because you want to be a bureaucrat.  Do you want to be a bureaucrat?<p>Even if you want to be a bureaucrat, there's no guarantee that you'll be good at it.  Good bureaucrats don't write posts like the one you just wrote.  They don't antagonize anyone, ever, in any way.  They would rather lie - and they do.  Are you good at that?<p>One of the things you'll discover in academia, for instance, is that the most appalling faux pas you can commit is to say anything bad about your colleagues' research.  ""Colleagues"" meaning, of course, only whatever little log-rolling grant mafia you've wound up joining.  You're perfectly free to criticize its enemies - though not the endeavor as a whole.  Oh, you didn't want to join a mafia?  You think someone is going to fund you just because you're smart and have cool ideas?  Strange ideas you have there, kid.<p>I understand what you want CS research to be.  CS research isn't what you want it to be.  CS research is a gigantic government bureaucracy.  Nor is it unique.  Science itself is a gigantic government bureaucracy.  Do you think it's not deceptive?  Systematic deception is its very lifeblood.<p>Can science of the sort you're looking for exist?  Of course it can exist.  You can find it very easily.  All you need is a time machine.  Set the controls for at least 40 years ago.<p>Otherwise, the simplest way to do the kind of research you want to do is to decide quite consciously to give yourself over to the salt-mining industry in the most mercenary possible way, spend a decade making as much money as you possibly can (and spending as little as you can), and (if you succeed) found your own little university of one.

3805642,comment,3804608,3804608,35,0,henryl,,,"I am a co-founder at a startup that does advertising on WiFi networks. We only run advertising before you connect (when you are in a captive portal), without the use of proxying.<p>Before anyone overreacts to this article, it would be beneficial to understand the hospitality space. The hotel you stayed at is most likely owned by a franchise group and operated by a GM. GMs are responsible for contracting their own networking services with Hotel WiFi Operators such as the one mentioned here. As such, a major hotel brand such as Marriott may use <i>hundreds</i> of WiFi operators. WiFi operators range in size, managing anywhere between one property to tens of thousands.  The vast majority of these operators do not leverage javascript injection.<p>The ones that resort to proxied ad injection do so because hotel IT is a thin-margin business. WiFi is considered a cost center but is tolerated because it is the number one amenity requested by guests. Operators will sometimes offer a discounted service fee to the hotel GM in exchange for mid-stream ads, although, in this case, it is just as likely that the hotel GM is unaware of this. It is almost absolutely certain that Marriott is unaware of this. Even if they were made aware, the power balance between the brand and the franchisee is not clearly defined with regards to WiFi.<p>As much as I dislike ad injection, it is important to note that public WiFi is <i>never safe</i> unless you are using a VPN. It is offered as an amenity, one that GMs would be more than happy to get rid of if they could. Unlike with your broadband ISP, you have logged into a privately operated network. You are probably not paying for it. You are subject to their rules. Furthermore, when you signed onto the WiFi network, you most likely had to check a checkbox indicating your agreement to the terms of their network (which no one ever reads). As such, caveat emptor, etc.",1333678156

You can't hand solder a BGA, a machine applies solder paste as the last step in the PCB manufacturing process and then a pick and place (robotic arm pulling parts off reels) sets the chips before sending the PCB through a reflow machine (an oven).<p>Even for small batch runs of boards with QFP chips (which you can hand solder) you would machine all this, and I mean like 50 board runs.  I've even done this in lab for 10 board proto runs.  You make a solder paste stencil out of plastic to apply the paste after you get the boards back from the PCB manufacturer, place the chips and solder them in a reflow oven (or even a frying pan works if you paying attention and have an IR temp sensor).<p>The only bits you hand solder, even in Asian, are components that are too large or can't withstand the temperatures of machine soldering, be it wave or reflow (think full size RCA connectors on a board with many fine pitch ICs or a wall wart).  This is normally a post processing step after everything else has been reflowed.  Connectors of this type don't really exist in cell phones, they are all surface mount with some minimal unsoldered through hole supports.<p>The manual assembly that comes into play with a modern cell phone involves connecting the various PCBs with their interconnects and placing them in the proper location within the packaging and of course all the post electronics stuff.",1333678120

They can't really; they don't have the talent in-house.  It's fairly expensive to do correctly.  Most hotels weren't built with cat-5 installed, so you have to pay someone to go do that.  Then you have to install a bunch of networking gear which isn't cheap.  Then you have to pay someone to monitor it all and come out and fix it when it goes down.  You probably also want some 1-800 number your guests can call when they can't get on-line.  The costs add up pretty quickly.<p>So how do you pay for it all?  You're in a hotels.com price war with all your competitors, so you can't just raise room rates.  Your customers will get pissed off if you tell them they have to pay extra for wifi.  So eventually some genius comes along and gives you this brilliant idea that will make wifi pay for itself, and this is what you get.",1333678098

Today I can absolutely get those jobs.<p>My girlfriend went through the exact same evolution.

Meanwhile another classmate with a less stellar but similar resume took a job at the regional bank. Two years later he switched into JPMorgan. My roommate who passed has basically been unable to get any job - even the regional bank jobs he once considered beneath him.<p>So don't let the frustration make you do something stupid and pass on the dumb job offers.

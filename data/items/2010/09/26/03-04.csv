There's a number of companies doing really interesting things with cool languages like Clojure and Erlang, even if they are ""silly companies"".<p>There's companies like Justin.TV which is the largest real time video streaming company in the world.  Real time video streaming is very, very hard to do at scale.<p>AirBnB is revolutionizing the hospitality industry, and last I read are the largest provider of rooms in New York.<p>There are amazingly cool companies working on SSD database appliances, and on databases optimized specifically for SSD's. SSD add on cards for your PCIE graphics slot that give you 6x the throughput of a SATA port.  Those companies don't exactly make for exiting reading in Newsweek, so they don't get a lot of press, though.<p>Yeah, there's a lot of people making Facebook apps.  Sure, you can mock twitter because on it's surface it seems silly and trivial, but they have invented an entirely new communication protocol which companies like StockTwits are leveraging to allow individuals to broadcast their recent stock trades.  And, not only that, but the article says that Twitter hasn't figured out how to make money yet.  In fact, Business Week reports that they were profitable in 2009:  <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2009/tc20091220_549879.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2009/tc200...</a><p>Sure Zynga makes somewhat whimsical addictive games, but if you stop and crunch the numbers, Farmville's digital economy is probably mlarger than the real world economies of many developing nations.<p>So, if you'd like to believe that Silicon Valley has lost it's way go right ahead.  But, from where I sit, things are just beginning to get interesting. Silicon Valley is just starting to fire on all cylinders since the tech bubble popped in 2000.  If you want to know how I'm seeing Silicon Valley: I'm strapping in and getting ready for a great big ride.",1285473565

Note the equity splits, the agreed-upon vesting schedule (standard seems to be 4 year vesting, first 25% after 1 year, then monthly after that, with double-trigger acceleration upon acquisition), what everyone is agreeing to for the IP, and any other rules you might be coming up with for the business.<p>This just keeps everyone on the same page right from the get-go, and prevents revisionist history later.

1728477,comment,1727938,1727938,0,0,cletus,,,"I have to plead some ignorance on this one: I'm familiar with Australian securities law (at a very high level) but American securities law is of course quite something else.<p>Price-fixing I'm not sure applies here. It normally applies on the sell side but not the buy side. So if all the gas stations in the country said they would charge $6/gallon that would be price fixing. If all the consumers said they wouldn't pay more than $1.50/gallon then that's not price-fixing in the same sense.<p>But which side the angel investors are treated as is open to interpretation. It's also worth noting that this is investment rather than the sale of goods or services so price-fixing, depending on the law, may not even apply.<p>Collusion is a little more interesting. Australia has very strict laws here compared to the US (to both our benefit and detriment I suspect). I'm not even sure how to begin at unravelling such a thing.<p>It strikes me a little odd that it's the FBI spearheading this. I would've thought the FTC and/or the SEC would've been at the front of this. The FBI means the DoJ doesn't it? Or is the FBI the enforcement arm for these kinds of actions?<p>One disturbing possibility that would require FBI intervention: racketeering. Take a look at RICO:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrup...</a><p>Trigger offences include securities fraud:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_fraud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_fraud</a><p>""Securities fraud, also known as stock fraud and investment fraud, is a practice that induces investors to make purchase or sale decisions on the basis of false information, frequently resulting in losses, in violation of the securities laws.""<p>Now that normally applies to companies but could it be applied to the enticement of other investors? If angel A puts in money at $3m pre-money while at the same time someone else is putting in money at $4m pre-money, enticed by angel A (without A disclosing his or her better deal), couldn't that qualify as securities fraud?<p>IANAL and it seems unlikely but when you get any securities malfeasance or the appearance thereof the whole thing can really spider in all sorts of unexpected directions.",1285472703

Even if I had paid for all this, all of my education would not have come close to 100k (I know this has been addressed in other comments).  All of my coursework after undergrad (roughly 24 courses) was done while working full time. The only real opportunity cost is in undergrad.  Some of the first masters and all of the additional course work I've taken have been paid by employers.<p>Additionally I would say that the balance of course work (requiring an artist to take biology and a biologist to take art) is the most important part of an undergrad degree. In my experience well-roundedness is extremely important in real-world problem solving.

1728471,comment,1728220,1728220,0,0,annajohnson,,,"Is the question really: am I better off completing college, spending a few years with a big company (or a startup) and then starting my own company... or is it: what do I want to achieve - e.g. build my own company in the xyz industry - and what is the best way for me to achieve that? If you know that you want to start 'a' company but don't know exactly what kind of company or what industry, etc the question may then become: what would I like to learn about and what will enable me to learn about that? The answer may well be to go to / stay in college and then work for a company or two in order to develop business skills and work out what kind of business you'd like to build. On the other hand, if you know exactly what you want to start, and have the skills and resources to 'just do it', maybe you are better off dropping out of college. Personally, I am almost a textbook example of Vivek's advice precisely because I wasn't sure what kind of business I wanted to start back in my high school and university days. I will say this, though, even if you stay in college or work for another company, I recommend starting some kind of business on the side. Not only will you learn skills you won't learn at college or in a big company - and you may stumble on the business you really want to commit to - but it will also help off-set the socialization (i.e. to keep that nice, high paying job with benefits) that can arise in a big corporate environment and that may stop you from ever taking the entrepreneurial plunge.",1285472397

For me,  dropping out to try my first startup and returning to school after it failed was literally filling out a single-sided form when I left and filling out a similar single-sided form when I wanted to return.  If it's that easy at your college, the risk of dropping out is extremely small, so if you have an idea you are passionate about and the opportunity to execute on it, you may as well try.  I'll bet somebody told Mark Zuckerberg that he was probably not Bill Gates, so he should probably stay in school.",1285472361

1728453,comment,1728367,1728367,0,0,lzw,,,"It is easy to understand.  Government spending comes out of the economy via taxes and inflation. Taxes reduce company and personal profits reducing budgets for the next year, and thus reducing spending on purchases or expansion that would create jobs.  Inflation raises costs, having the same effect.<p>Meanwhile, the government spending is often in non-productive sectors of the economy, such as increasing government jobs at all levels of government, which going forward add an additional spending burden on the economy.<p>Very little of the investment is even in areas targeted at building jobs.  Hiring a bunch of people to build a bridge or highway does not create permanent jobs, and the positive impact of that highway or bridge is spread over many years, while the job hit from the spending starts immediately.  Most government ""innovation"" efforts are misguided, poorly allocated or poorly managed, and rarely produce any substantive industry creation or economic growth.  This is to be expected since politicians do not understand business very well, and have an incentive to feather their own nests or build their own political empires & burocratic fiefdoms. Thus the incentive is towards having more cushy government jobs to hand out as favors, and more employees under them... not to produce anything beneficial to society or the economy.<p>Further, it is not in government interest, really, to have a robust economy, because it is the damage done to the economy-- by government-- that lets government rationalize the power grab to have more control over the economy.  Thus government ""profits"" by doing damage to the economy.  The 2008 collapse is the result of government policies- clintons ""you must loan to people who can't repay the loans"" housing problem, the moral hazard of fannie mae and freddie mac, and bushs ""we're gonna set interest rates below inflation""... stoked by constant economic pronouncements from everyone from the president to the fed chairman to Paul Krugman that there was no housing bubble and that if there was it would be good for the economy (the latter a position krugman took in one of his articles.)",1285471643

Let's face it, <i>most</i> college dropouts will not become billionaires.<p>But, there are exceptions.<p>I recently went through the Forbes billionaire list and picked out everyone that made their fortune through technology. I found that about ~35% had no Bachelor's degrees and ~55% had no Master's degrees. Then I looked at the top 7 on the list and saw that more than 50% did not have Bachelor's degrees. It is also interesting to note that billionaire college dropouts are worth $9bn on average, compared to billionaires with Ph.D.'s, worth an average of $3bn.<p>Most college dropouts don't become billionaires. But, an overwhelming number of tech billionaires <i>are</i> college dropouts. Interesting...<p>Why is there such a high percentage of tech billionaires that are college dropouts? My theory is that there are people that are born entrepreneurs and will become billionaires whichever path they take in life. Most of these people are very smart, and, as a result, end up going to Ivy Leagues. But, a time comes (usually around age 19 or sophomore year in college), when something just wakes up in them and they decide to drop out and take the plunge. These are the Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerbergs of the world.<p>Dropping out of college does not increase your chances of success. If you look at statistics, it decreases your chances. It's just that the born entrepreneurs ""wake up"" right around age 19-20 (which happens to be right in the middle of college), and end up dropping out. Only if you are in this tiny group of born entrepreneurs would it make sense for you to drop out of college.",1285470170

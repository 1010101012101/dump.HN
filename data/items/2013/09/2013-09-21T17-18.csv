As far as domestic surveillance goes, NSA seems to be approaching the level in terms of capabilities of Chinese MSS. In terms of foreign surveillance, although we can safely assume NSA has access to more fiber and hence internet traffic, there seems little reason to think their hacking activities are any more prevalent than any other large intelligence agency. Those capabilities are, after all, rather cheap.<p>What we haven&#x27;t learned of, at least yet, is rampant industrial espionage by NSA to steal R&D and a pipeline for dealing with the stolen results. China, at least according to US allegations, has precisely that.",1379786294
6423802,comment,6422998,6423684,7,0,cpncrunch,,,"Really? I just did a quick comparison, and w3schools was much better than MDN. Try looking for info on the &#x27;required&#x27; attribute of the input tag. w3schools has all the attributes in a compact table making it easy to find the attribute you&#x27;re looking for at a glance, whereas MDN has a big long list. In w3schools you can then click on the &#x27;required&#x27; attribute to get more info about it and see which browsers it works on. In MDN there is no info on browser compatibility in the &#x27;required&#x27; description - you have to scroll down to ANOTHER table (there is not even a link to it) to see what browser it is compatible with! Come on, even back in web 1.0 we had links to stuff!<p>The reason that w3schools is at the top of the search results is that more people find it useful that MDN. Perhaps it isn&#x27;t as cool with the hipsters as MDN, but for people trying to get things done w3schools is more useful in my opinion.",1379786293

The default assumption is of course that everyone makes rational decisions, including the poor.<p>Since they are making decisions that you don&#x27;t think are rational (&quot;it&#x27;s probably rare for the optimal solution ...&quot;), you conclude that the reason is that the poor people are less well-informed.<p>This makes sense, so long as everyone has equal access to the same services, or at least access to the same services you do, and that there is competition among those services.<p>However, as the author points out, the poor areas are under-served in terms of banking choices, and banks use &quot;private databases like ChexSystems that currently keep more than a million low income Americans from being able to open accounts.&quot;<p>Because of the obvious market inequality, you cannot conclude as you did that the people who use RiteCheck are making either an irrational decision or un-informed decisions.",1379786268

Properly means expensive audits, expensive HSMs, expensive secure rooms with multi-factor authentication to enter, auditing of all actions, long-term record retention, reliable and performant OCSP responders, endless documentation (DR, secure hardware lifecycle policies, etc), being an active member of the CABForum to drive your agenda and keep abreast of changing industry requirements, and much, much more. Of course, by doing so you are attempting to upend a multi-billion dollar industry, so expect a political fight with the CAs and potentially the browsers as well...<p>These problems are part of what lead people to prefer replacing the industry (DANE, Convergence, TACK) over building a non-profit CA in the existing model.

6423783,comment,6418628,6422068,0,0,wat0,,,"I have read the charter, yes. have you?  Do you forget that the religious freedoms part is mean that neither the citizens nor government dictate what religions to follow or practice.  What Quebec is trying to change is how the government dictates how the government may represent itself, that is as secular.  It still does not affect you personally, or how you identify yourself publicly at all; unless you work in government, but why would you want to work for the government?  Doesn&#x27;t pay well and is shit.<p>I don&#x27;t think you understand cognitive dissonance at all.  Do you presume to know how all of Canada feels?  Perhaps the majority of people nearest you do share the same thoughts on the subject, and that you don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s right.  Just because someone happens to offer a different viewpoint than you, and you happen to disagree with it, doesn&#x27;t mean that I have cognitive dissonance.  I&#x27;m more than capable of accepting new ideas.  This idea in particular is different than the one I grew up with and I happen to see value it in.<p>You clearly do not understand what I&#x27;m saying.  I don&#x27;t care what people practice, or how they are in their own homes or out in public.  I don&#x27;t feel untoward or speak ill of anyone who is religious or wants to wear things they consider to be part of whatever it is they consider to be their identity.  What I <i>do</i> think is fair is that anyone representing government not display their beliefs.  It&#x27;s not fair that quebec has made distinctions between what is acceptable and not.  Nothing should be worn by individuals.  It doesn&#x27;t matter nor does it help to perform your job.  If you work somewhere, it&#x27;ll most likely have a dress code.  Consider this an extension of that.<p>I don&#x27;t mind that many canadians feel this is a violation of the charter; maybe they should be thinking about what they value more: how government represents and polices itself or social identity.  This has nothing to do with how the government treats citizens.  Yes, citizens make up the government; but guess what - you&#x27;re not representing segments and races: you&#x27;re representing canada.<p>But isn&#x27;t canada made up of many races? Am I seriously suggesting people not represent things they cannot change, which is skin colour or whatnot. no.  but what are you really trying to accomplish in government? represent canada or whatever background you happened to be born into without choice.<p>you don&#x27;t like my thoughts since it doesn&#x27;t fit your ideal and initial world view: that&#x27;s cognitive dissonance.  I can accept people for who they are, and I really don&#x27;t care about this issue as much as it may seem, despite replying to your bait and various others.  At the end of the day, Quebec isn&#x27;t going to get what they want, and canada is going to keep on rolling; you&#x27;ll have your way, and I won&#x27;t care what Quebec&#x27;s decision is.<p>Still want me to leave?

By mere chance, they happen to last long enough for the actually useful changes to build on top of them. For example, see Lenski&#x27;s long term evolution experiment with e. coli.[1] He&#x27;s spent 25 years breeding several populations of e. coli, and freezing samples every 500 generations or so (every 75 days). After about 20 years, he discovered that one of the strains had evolved the ability to metabolize citrate in an aerobic environment, which e. coli normally can&#x27;t do. Going back to the historical record, unfreezing some of the past samples and repeating the experiment, he found that sample from after generation 20,000 could re-evolve this trait, but clones from before that time could not, indicating that there was a potentiating mutation that that particular strain had had shortly before generation 20,000, which the other samples did not have. Further evidence has shown that it may have actually been two separate potentiation mutations.<p>Beyond that, however, proto feathers would have probably been useful for insulation. They seem fairly similar to down feathers, which are great insulators. Given the the feathers were also colorful, they may also have been decorative, and used for catching the eye of potential mates.<p>1: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli_long-term_evolution_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli_long-term_evo...</a>",1379785436

Citing vanity metrics like number of downloads and even revenue (as was done here) is a nice way to obscure this fact.<p>The catch is that to get people to send postcards you need to give them one for free otherwise nobody converts. (This makes sense since they otherwise don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re buying.) You also need to let them pay in bulk for credits or else it is a completely lost cause. The problem is for every person who ultimately becomes a customer, you have too many people who send a free one and forget about you, which costs you real money. The margin on your paid customers needs to make up this sunk cost, which leaves little room for real profit.<p>The numbers just don&#x27;t work, and no amount of additional product tweaks or marketing pushes really seem that they can move the proper needle (free-to-paid customer conversion rate) enough (to me) for the model to make sense. It took a lot of work to get to the point to validate this so it&#x27;s not surprising there are a lot of dead in the water apps in this space that get no traction at all. Essentially you have a low profit-per-sale product that has a fixed customer acquisition cost, and the margins are so tiny that you&#x27;re threading a needle. Unlike other apps, where the customer acquisition cost can in theory drop to zero.<p>So I&#x27;m not surprised to see that Postcards on the Run is bleeding cash. I looked at their app in the beginning and I can&#x27;t even imagine how they&#x27;re getting any orders since the app is so poorly designed. Asking for more money for marketing purposes is hilarious since that will just likely scale up the rate at which they are losing money. I also would not be surprised if Postagram is bleeding tons of cash also. Their app is spectacularly designed but it&#x27;s an unprofitable model. They have a high volume app for which they are almost certainly losing money on most of those users. (&quot;We lose money on every sale, but we&#x27;ll make it up on volume.&quot;) I&#x27;m also fairly certain all of these companies are using the same printing company, so I have a sense what their margins are and I had the same. (There&#x27;s also not much flexibility there since US postal service costs are known entities.)<p>I could be wrong though and they may have cracked it somehow. I know they have tried partnering with advertisers to subsidize the free cards (which could work, in theory) but I can&#x27;t imagine an advertiser paying the amount needed per card to offset things properly. The fact they actually recently did this tells me they realize the free cards are killing them, otherwise why plaster ads all over their product (the design and quality of which they obviously put a lot of care into.) They also give away 5 free cards which to me is absolute madness since I failed to make things work even when giving away a single free card.<p>Obviously sinking 5-10k of your own money into an experiment like this for 6 months seems much more attractive to me than burning through a few million VC dollars and spending a few years of your life on an idea that is likely doomed. (And then having to go on Shark Tank for more money?) This is why it&#x27;s important to bootstrap and validate the main hypothesis with an MVP and a few iterations before going big. I am able to keep this app running cheaply for friends and family, learned a lot and improved my design skills, and can focus on something that has more promise being confident I know what the opportunity cost is.",1379785287

Typical of the global supply chain, many inputs that manufacturers need to produce toilet paper are also imported. But since Venezuela has extensive currency exchange controls to regulate the flow of foreign currency (which can either be bought/sold or obtained through trade), the government must approve all imports -- and the red tape involved is legendary.</i><p><i>In theory, the way the Venezuelan system should work is the following: The government authorizes imports by selling dollars that businesses buy to make international purchases at a heavily-subsidized price -- discounted at a much lower price than what the black market sells it for. After the imports have arrived and have cleared customs (lines at ill-equipped Venezuelan ports can last weeks), local manufacturers produce their goods, and then sell their products at tightly-controlled prices.</i><p><i>[...]</i><p><i>In reality, the government&#x27;s ineffective regulation not only discourages investment, but creates incentives for people in the chain of production to take advantage of access to cheap dollars and sell them in the highly profitable black market.

All that matters is accuracy and precision. This is how science works, at its base. There&#x27;s no such thing as &quot;sense data&quot;.<p>True, the signals from tree rings (etc.) are noisier than those from kitchen thermometers. Let&#x27;s consider, for a moment, how you could verify the precision and come to a conclusion as to the accuracy of those signals: well, when you get the same information coming from multiple seemingly independent sources, it greatly increases your confidence in that information. Hence, if you&#x27;re doing your modeling right, if you get tree ring data from <i>all over the world</i>, and soil samples from <i>all over the world</i>, and find that, sure enough, there is a common signal visible across all of them, then you say &quot;well, the only thing that can explain this global correlation is the modulation of some global parameters&quot;. And you present your data and conclusions to a bunch of people whose <i>job</i> it is to poke holes in it and prove you wrong, and after a bunch of time eventually people whose job it is to prove each other wrong end up roughly agreeing on a small sliver of information that lies at the intersection of all their understandings of the world.<p>Signals in physics can be noisy too (fortunately, in physics you can take millions of samples).

Even trying to find an ATM in the part of town I work in can be a challenge. They recently built one and it has so many lights an mirrors around it, it seems a bit silly.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the banks use to determine whether they open/close a certain branch. Everyone jokes that &#x27;The First National on MLK Boulevard got robbed twice a month so they shut it down&#x27;, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some real process with population density and more importantly, income density.<p>When you cash your check at a liquor store, two things happen - you end up buying things like food for your family (as well as beer + cigarettes + lotto) and they take a % cut. The bank doesn&#x27;t have anything for you to buy and they don&#x27;t take a cut.<p>This also means the poor can&#x27;t pay their bills online. Again, in the bad side of town on Fridays and on the 1st and 14th of the month, there are massive lines outside the power company, city water department, and cable company. Everyone&#x27;s standing there waiting to pay their bill in cash. While the rest of us pay everything from our smartphone or have it directly taken out of our accounts, they&#x27;re spending two hours in line during the day.",1379784795

The prototypical mutable type is an array; the prototypical immutable types are numbers: if you change the imaginary part of a complex number, you don&#x27;t have the same number with different content, you have a different number. When you think about strings as arrays of bytes like you do in C, it makes sense for them to be mutable; in a higher level language where they behave much more like atomic values, it makes much more sense for them to be immutable – it can be really jarring when some called code deep down in the guts of a program mutates a string and you see the results at the top level. In C++, which is somewhere between a low level and high level language, it&#x27;s hard to say which way it should be, but the STL approach does seem to treat them more like values than containers, which implies that they probably should be immutable.",1379783986

The building was unleased, and the owner was happy to lease it to him at an excellent rate (it had sat unleased for 4 years). He had pre-orders for his first league session for almost 80 teams. He had a local investor that was willing to front the cost of the indoor field. He could comply with 100% of the local health and safety regulations, and only had one deterrent: The city planners. They insisted that this entire city block was to be used for upscale retail...no restaurants, no office space, no mini marts, no grocery stores, no movie theaters, no coffee shops, no used book stores, no NGOs, no news stands, and especially no indoor soccer facilities. The owner of the real estate declared bankruptcy a year or two later (it appears most of the other owners of property on the block followed suit) because he couldn&#x27;t find a single tenant to get past the city planners. I believe the property has now been seized by the city, where it hasn&#x27;t sold anything since.

For those of you not familiar with DC&#x27;s geography, the District of Columbia was originally a perfectly square diamond.  The portion on the south side of the Potomac was given back to Virginia due to congressional lobbying in the early 1800&#x27;s creating laws which mandated building all Federal buildings on the north side of the Potomac.  This left the Arlington/Alexandria portions of the District of Columbia as poor, economic backwaters.  No Federal money pouring in, and also no congressional representation.  Virginia took them back.<p>The cities of Arlington and Alexandria now occupy the portion of the original diamond that is west of the Potomac.  When standing in Georgetown, you look across the river and see 20 story office buildings.  Arlington and Alexandria act as quasi-DC, in the sense that they are dense, are connected via DC&#x27;s subway system (Metro) and separated from DC only by a relatively narrow river.<p>Lifting the height limit, I think, would be a great thing for DC.  It is an overly suburbanized metro area due to the height restrictions.",1379782903

I just thought the story side of it was very rushed.<p>edit: Oops, I didn't mean to reply to your message. The game story is a bit of a jumble. You start by chasing this arms dealer (The Jackal mentioned in the article) but spend at least 2/3rds of the game running errands for two factions in a civil war (they both offer you missions and you can choose which to accept). I've tried playing it twice but never made it too the end, it gets a bit monotonous by hour 20. That's mainly because you don't care about your foes or allies in the game.

than 23,000 people.<p>* “If the transaction value enabled by the GDS industry went to a single company, it would rank third on the Fortune 500 list, behind only Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil,” said Arthur Sackler, Executive Director of the Interactive Travel Services Association, which commissioned the study.<p>* “Transactions powered by GDS companies are the financial lifeblood for tens of thousands of travel agents, tour operators, hotels, airlines, car rental agencies, and other participants in the travel industry.  We must continue to support policies that allow the GDS industry full access to travel provider data without unreasonable restrictions, so travelers can continue to get the information they need to make informed travel choices, and the travel industry can benefit from the efficiency of a GDS-based distribution system.”",1266539850

Or Windows where there are a gazillion of widget sets that only happen to look like each other?

In 1987 alone, he says, he spent at least 1000 hours railing against the tax code -- about 20 hours a week.<p>His obsession with, and resentment of, the IRS started when he and others tried to create their own religious organization, ostensibly to draw attention to the capricious laws exempting religious organizations from taxes. How this plan was supposed to work is unclear. L. Ron Hubbard saw the same opportunity and was better at exploiting it.<p>People don't respond well to acts of violence directed against them or those with whom they empathize. Timothy McVeigh's act caused shock and anger yet achieved nothing. Whatever message Stack wanted to convey has been utterly discredited by attempting to murder people going about their day.

In addition to ""criticism"" and ""news reporting"" and the rest of the items in the fair use preamble, the CRA proposes the addition of three more: ""incidental uses, non-consumptive uses, and personal, non-commercial uses."" They might sound minor, but these suggestions are bound to provoke controversy. </i><p>As you say it is ""and personal, non-commercial uses."". This drafting fails as it is not clear if the last clause is a disjunct or not. The article's author misquotes this through out as ""personal and non-commercial"". There are differences between his version and the draft quoted.<p>Bear with me.<p>If activity denies a business of revenue which they otherwise rightly would receive then it is arguably commercial.<p>Hence a ""personal"" use could be format shifting, say.

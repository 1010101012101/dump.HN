258820,comment,258609,258609,0,0,isaacewing,,,"This is both a tear jerking article and a realization to startups everywhere.<p>Your idea seems good... initially... with no answer to the chicken and the egg problem... how do you become a dominate entity...<p>I'm only 23 and yet I vividly remember over half of these startups.  Granted the majority of these started and ended during the dot com boom / collapse, these are still and will always be a realization to internet specific companies.  No user base means no revenue.<p>Many questions arise; do you need to sell if you have a dominate opponent offering a lucrative opportunity (Alta-Vista <- Google) or do you wait it out (Facebook -> Google) and postulate an opportunity greater than your biggest competitor believes can or more importantly will see for the fate of your company.<p>Friendster is a company much like Facebook with many unique niches to offer.  Why did they fail?  Did they not see that bigger picture; did they not have a good board of directors; did they not have a robust infrastructure?<p>If you had a bulletproof startup that had every corner covered, had an outstanding leadership team with a concise business model and looked at each niche and improved it; is that the recipe for success or does that give them a 50/50 chance for success?<p>I think:\nFriendster, Ning and sites similar offer a unique niche.\nFacebook, MySpace and sites similar are the sites above combined.\nWhat if you were the site that combines the unique niche of the most popular sites like Facebook and MySpace?  What if you had a dominate leadership team that had a robust product which offered the most popular services combined and improved on those ideas. How does that separate FedEx from the USPS?  If a company has a lucid vision for their product, how do you separate that from the already existing ideas... after all... every new idea is generated from an existing problem?  How do you separate a new idea from a solution to an existing dilemma... how do you separate a better solution from an existing one?  Is  the quality of that solution directly pending the ease of use to the end - user or is it determined by the freedom, creativity, ingenuity, funding and end - user registration numbers?\nI think the ultimate success of any company: good, bad and mediocre is based on the personal beliefs of the initiator of the product and their 'support team' (startup partners).  If they ALL firmly believe in the success of their product with absolutely no doubt then they have the material, answer and solution to solve the loop - hole that garnishes users and divides the user base among other entities that offer similar services.",1217224449

258769,comment,258688,258688,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Oh man, if ever there was a topic where ""advice = overgeneralization + limited life experience"", this is it.  I can share bits and pieces of my own life story, but take any advice I give with a grain of salt.  People are different; what worked for me may not work for your brother.<p>Like your brother, I did well in the early grades.  But when I reached age 11, I completely rebelled, went on ""strike"", and refused to do any work.  I didn't <i>want</i> to be successful, because I realized how empty conventional definitions of success are.  By 13, I refused to go to school at all.  I just walked out of the building when they made me - had the cops called on me several times.<p>The best decision I ever made in my lifetime was to go to a brand-new charter school for high school.  I didn't want to at first - I was incredibly cynical at that point, and believed that every place would be the same and the world just sucked.  (My dad is like your mom in some respects, though he has redeeming qualities as well.)<p>But when I got there, I found that was I was surrounded by people who, when faced with a problem, said ""Let's fix it"" instead of ""The system sucks, so why should I bother doing anything?""  Over time, that rubbed off.  It didn't happen immediately - it was about 3-4 years before I said to myself ""I want to be like <i>them</i>"", and about 10 years before I actually started acting like them.  I'm still working on it.<p>I guess one piece of ""advice"" I'd give you is to do your best to surround your brother with people who are actively choosing to make the world a better place.  This is hard - most of us forget how small our worlds were when we were in school.  It's hard to choose the sort of life you want to live when you're not given a lot of choice in anything.<p>Something else to think about:<p>By the time I was 16, my parents and nearly all the adults in my life had given up on me, and gave me a free pass to not do any work.  Remember how the Randy Pausch lecture said ""When you screw up, and people close to you don't tell you you've screwed up, that's a <i>very bad sign</i>, because that means they've given up on you""?  Well, for me, it was actually the most liberating thing in my life.  Because it meant that whatever I did, I was doing <i>for me</i>, and not to please somebody else's expectations of me.  (Okay, I did go to college to please my parents, and that was nearly a disaster...)  Once I'd thoroughly demolished everyone's dreams of me becoming a famous mathematician or physicist, I could do what <i>I wanted</i> to do, and do it with far more passion than if I was just fulfilling my parent's broken dreams.<p>As much as you want your brother to succeed, it has to come from him.  It's his life to lead, and his life to screw up if he chooses.  You can point the way, but you can't drag him there.<p>So - I dunno what advice to give you.  I don't think I'm even qualified to give advice on this.  I guess if it were my kid, I'd try to show him just how big the world is outside the gates of the schoolyard.  There're so many niches, professions, and hobbies that you don't even know about when you're in high school, and many of them can be quite exciting.  Get him into an internship or two, or a non-McDonalds job.  Introduce him to folks in different fields.  Let him surf the web and explore what's out there.",1217221388

In that sentence, ""statistically speaking"" refers to the fact that we describe water on a molecular scale as a statistical system (it does not mean that sometimes the system remembers). Also, ""a long time"" in statistical mechanics is taken as a time period much greater than the average time it takes for any two random water molecules to collide...in other words: ""a long time"" == nanoseconds.<p>By the ergodic theorem, once you remove a molecule from water, it forgets that molecule was ever present <i>within nanoseconds</i>. There is nothing in the spatial organization, the molecular translations, or any of the modes of vibration that would give you any clue that molecule had been present. In essence, the information of that molecules presence is erased. We call this entropy.<p>Ergodic theory is a mathematical theory that is key in describing systems in statistical mechanics. This is not a question of better scientific instruments. You would need to invalidate 100+ years of scientific knowledge for homeopathy to work as advertised.<p><i>Edit</i>: In all fairness, I guess I should clarify the ""statistically speaking"" bit. Technically, there is a non-zero probability that some bit of water will ""remember"" a molecule that was previously disolved in it. The nice thing about statistical mechanics is that it allows you to calculate exactly how frequently this would be expected to occur. The answer is that you would expect a volume of 1ml of water to ""remember"" for at least 1 second somewhere in the universe less than once...not once per minute or once per hour, but once per the lifetime of the universe. So, yeah, homeopathy is complete BS.",1322466849

The goal was to create a lookup structure based on this data that could then be used from C#. I used seq expressions for cleaning up the input stream, active patterns for parsing the XML, but felt that I had no other choice than to use classes with dictionary members for the lookup data structure. With well over 100,000 items to organize and store, I did not want the overhead of creating a functional structure that would then have to be converted to nested Dictionaries for C# use.

When you go to a coffee shop or a crowded store, you're buying something because you <i>actually</i> see others buying it.

For instance, it has a lot of different electronic systems, ranging from the displays to the multiple, backed-up computers that enable flight controls (manual flight) and manage auto-pilot inputs.<p>I've seen a CRJ-200's first officer's (copilot) flight PFD and ND gone black and reboot because someone in the back was trying to call home, without much success.<p>The thing is, that never happened to my friend pilot before even with passengers trying to call. And the power output of a phone trying to call without much coverage isn't the same as the power needed in the center of a big city (and at 8000ft, inside a huge metal tube, the cell reception isn't great).<p>That's one of the main reasons. Granted it shouldn't happen and plane manufacturers do test against these kind of things. And really important systems, like backup instruments (standby) or flight computers are hardly going to be affected by any kind of interference, so, no, the plane isn't just going to drop from the sky.  Yet an automatic A/P disconnection on long final on the PF's (pilot flying) PFD and ND displays going nuts is something serious.<p>And on the side of that, you don't want people having unknown electronic devices sending signals when pilots have to be more focused (take off and landing) and you better have them keeping an eye outside (or at their newspaper, but you can't help that). That's pretty much the same reason why they ask you to have everything stowed and leave your window 'opened' (you can see if there's something wrong outside, like fire, and report it) during takeoff and landing.",1322464287

Although this isn't anything like hiring, a similar rule-of-thumb might be a good idea - if either one of them wanted it badly enough, they would have worked something out already.",1216438333

Many other cultures focus on and place more emphasis on tradition and the past, or the present.  \nIt's the culturally reinforced tendency to constantly look to a future that is presumed to be better then the present that drives invention.\nwell that and necessity...and war.",1216438160
250465,comment,249956,250275,0,0,aardvarkious,,,"I was looking at a sweet one that also allows you to enter a code. It hooked up to the internet and allowed you to program restrictions on codes. For example, if you had a maid come in regularly (wouldn't that be nice?), her code would only work on certain days or during certain hours. Or if you were afraid you left your stove on and wanted someone to check, you could give them a code that would only work one time. I don't know how much you'd actually use those features, but it was a neat gadget.",1216437936

If I can get to the office before it gets too busy or distracting, I find I can jell a lot of ideas in the morning.<p>I am productive late at night, when I can go into the coding zone with little interruption.

If the latter, what happens when power goes down or the battery runs out and you want to get in or out?

250459,comment,250232,250232,0,0,pjackson,,,"This is a particularly interesting topic for Agile teams. Letting a team self-organize sometimes leads to a team wanting to ""self-organize someone off the team"".<p>I've had my Scrum masters come to me twice in the past two years and ask to have a team member removed. One needed to get fired, one needed to be reassigned to a position that better suited his talents.<p>In both cases, the team experienced an immediate productivity boost and jelled better.<p>The key for the manager is letting the team know that you trust them enough to bring those issues to you.",1216437424

But the quality of Apple's own replacements (like Keynote) and the ease with which they can interoperate with Microsoft Office (Keynote is a better Powerpoint than Powerpoint) makes the transition very easy.

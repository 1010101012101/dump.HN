Since labor unions had a monopoly on labor in many jobs, workers were able to extract excellent wages from their employers.<p>Now that goods and services can move relatively freely across our borders, then labor unions can't demand higher wages, because the union isn't a monopoly any more -- industry has the option of relocating operations overseas.<p>The downward pressure on wages from this has resulted in a redistribution of wealth from labor to capital (I'm not on board with many of their policy suggestions, but the Occupy movement was on to something with their ""top one percent"" rhetoric).<p>As they lose earning power, people start to cut their budgets.

Build a good prototype and evaluate if the product works and if there is demand on a really small scale<p>2. Try to raise money through crowdfounding.<p>3. If it works, you have proven to everybody (including yourself and potential later investors) that there indeed is a market for your product(s). You dont have to step in front of investors and try to sell an unproven idea. Try to make a hit product and get VCs on board after this stage (if you need to)<p>4.

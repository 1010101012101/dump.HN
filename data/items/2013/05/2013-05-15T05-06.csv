5710401,comment,5708976,5710038,2,0,tikhonj,,,"The problem is that most of those implementations--even the OCaml one--are much more awkward to use than the Haskell version. So people don't.<p>In Haskell, the type system--thanks to typeclasses--can figure out how to generate random inputs automatically, just based on what type is expected. Even if you have a custom type, it's incredibly easy to define how to generate elements and then use it everywhere. Or you could easily randomly generate values in an ad-hoc method wherever they're used.<p>This takes advantage of the fact that in Haskell, values can be polymorphic on their <i>return</i> types. As far as I know, this is a feature unique to typeclasses--and very few languages aside from Haskell support those. (I only know of one other: Rust.) This, combine with Haskell's usual popular abstractions like Applicative Functors, makes writing QuickCheck-style properties and new random generators much easier.<p>Of course, this particular reason has nothing to do with functional programming and everything to do with Haskell's glorious type system. However, functional programming <i>does</i> play a role in QuickCheck's popularity as well.<p>Basically, QuickCheck-style tests are primarily useful for code that does not have side effects. QuickCheck lets you check some invariant by evaluating the same function hundreds or thousands of times with randomly generated input. This style simply does not scale to non-trivial non-local state, much less actual IO.<p>So even if your language had a usable QuickCheck library, it would only be useful for the more functional parts of your code. As the article points out, unit tests push you towards a functional style to some extent. QuickCheck does this <i>far more</i>. And so most people writing rampantly imperative code in wantonly imperative languages simply don't use QuickCheck. Even if some intrepid soul <i>has</i> ported it.",1368597169

I will happily pay that premium since my hosting bill far outweighs my domain registration, and handling support tickets expediently and providing features I want are far more important than the bottom line to me.

Since no central entity creates Bitcoins, lets say the jars are distributed among a few hundred different people. When someone wants to sell one, he doesn't get the luxury of asking everyone else to make a bid - he has to compete with everyone else who wants to sell their jars. The buyers will line up in order of the price they are willing to pay, and the sellers in order of the price they are willing to take. Where they meet will be the price the market has discovered.

And every time I see people give them money, I feel compelled to explain to them that the money won't actually help them, but a sandwich might.<p>This is a visible problem, especially to tourists, which may be why it's so widely talked about. But there are other extreme problems with the city. Consider rent control, which is only barely mentioned in this article. It's actively destroying the city. Most economists agree about the effects of rent control, too, and studies have shown the negative effects to be strikingly similar to many of the problems SF is currently facing (which will only continue to get worse). <a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/RentControl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/RentControl.html</a>.<p>How about we solve this problem before SF is just a business center with 0 housing. Then with all that extra housing, we find a place to take better care of our homeless? It's really hard to put them up when you just don't have the appropriate accommodations for it.",1368595538

The reader feels lost. Not a good way to start a blog post (or a news release).<p>Here it is:<p><i>The solvers in modern simulation codes in applications such as CFD, FEA and molecular dynamics are becoming more sophisticated by the day. While taking advantage of (i) new technologies in hardware and (ii) advances in numerical methods, many of these solvers require close monitoring to ensure they converge to a useful and correct solution. It is important to know when a simulation reaches an un-desired state so it can be stopped and the problem can be diagnosed.</i><p>How would I re-write that? Ok, let's find out what the underlying subject is.<p>* It is important to know when a simulation reaches an un-desired state so it can be stopped and the problem can be diagnosed.*<p>This is the main subject for the main paragraph. It should be the opening thought, and not the last sentence in it. But, at its current state, is not very clear. Let's re-write it:<p><i>Rescale releases a new feature. It is called ""live tailing."" The feature allows you to track simulations. You will be able to know when a simulation has reached an undesired state. This way, troubleshooting problems becomes easier.</i><p>See? It introduces the reader to what the feature is, covers the main points, and allows for a good reading flow.<p>But let's continue.<p><i>We call this feature live tailing.<p>Live tailing allows Rescale customers to monitor any output file for jobs running on the cluster with just one click. This feature replaces the currently painful process of dealing with ssh keys, logging into the cluster, and / or deciphering where the relevant files are located on the server. Rescales live tailing is intuitive, user-friendly, highly secure, and much more efficient than traditional monitoring.</i><p>The term live tailing is a good one. But they forgot to denote the sub-headline as such. A simple <h4></h4> would have fixed it. The paragraph is a disaster. Worse than the first one. That second sentence. My god! Its difficult to read. Let's try and re-write this in a manner that is easy to read, and drives the point home.<p><i>We call this feature Live Tailing.</i><p><i>Here is what Live Tailing does for you: it monitors the output file of any job you may be running in a cluster. It replaces the painful process of:<p>- dealing with ssh keys<p>- logging into the cluster itself<p>- deciphering where all of the relevant files are located<p>In simple words, it is an intuitive and user friendly way to monitor your jobs. It is also highly secure, and more efficient that traditional monitoring.</i><p>Now, this is another confusing part. The ""how it works"" part is out of place. I would have simply put in a link to a free trial or a video demonstration. I'm skipping this part.<p>Oh yes, the ""Why is it useful"" part. This is a good sub-headline to use.
Let's read:<p><i>As engineers, we recognize how important it is to track the status of any analysis at any time. Here are some examples of useful applications for live tailing:<p>- Monitor progress of a simulation, either to extrapolate total expected runtime or to ensure that the simulation doesnt enter a negative state.<p>- View output plots to quickly analyze important trends and metrics of the simulation.<p>- Monitor load balancing for parallelized simulations to diagnose inefficient behavior and to help
the customer choose the correct number of processors.<p>- Monitor time step conditions such as CFL or adaptive grid conditions to ensure that the simulation doesnt blow up. Simulations that creep along and blow up in time or size can now be stopped quickly.</i><p>This is good. Very good. To the next part:<p><i>Does live tailing work with image files as well?<p>Yes. Some simulation codes are able to generate image files such as meshes, graphs or surface plots. These files can be live tailed as well. Clicking on a file that is a jpg, png or gif will display the image right inside the browser. Check out this aircraft landing gear example using Gerris (<a href=""http://gfs.sourceforge.net/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gfs.sourceforge.net/wiki</a>), an open-source CFD code, with data provided by the AIAA.</i><p>This is also very good. Lots of good technical bits there. The link to the source file is particularly smart. Well done.<p>There is something missing after that paragraph. The article lacks a summary and a close. 
I'm torn. The first half of the article reads very poorly, but the second half reads very well. As if this was written by two (or more) people. Or maybe this is just a draft published too soon? 
I'm going to take what I wrote, and combine it with what they wrote. Let's see how it reads.<p>Rescale releases a new feature. It is called ""live tailing."" The feature allows you to track simulations. You will be able to know when a simulation has reached an undesired state. This way, troubleshooting problems becomes easier.<p>We call this feature Live Tailing.<p>Here is what Live Tailing does for you: it monitors the output file of any job you may be running in a cluster. It replaces the painful process of:<p>- dealing with ssh keys<p>- logging into the cluster itself<p>- deciphering where all of the relevant files are located<p>In simple words, it is an intuitive and user friendly way to monitor your jobs. It is also highly secure, and more efficient that traditional monitoring.<p>Why is Live Tailing useful?<p>As engineers, we recognize how important it is to track the status of any analysis at any time. Here are some examples of useful applications for live tailing:<p>- Monitor progress of a simulation, either to extrapolate total expected runtime or to ensure that the simulation doesnt enter a negative state.<p>- View output plots to quickly analyze important trends and metrics of the simulation.<p>- Monitor load balancing for parallelized simulations to diagnose inefficient behavior and to help

Well because so is Carnegie Mellon--has boasted the #1 Comp Sci program in several rankings but Pittsburgh is galaxies away from the bay area in being a startup hub.<p>Right, it's not that CMU has a bad engineering school, it's just that Stanford is so close to Silicon Valley (and helped create much of it) that it holds greater prestige in the startup community. I don't think anyone looks down on CMU as far as getting a good education goes.",1368594279

5710257,comment,5705995,5709543,1,0,hollerith,,,"The original ""value proposition"" of the WWW -- the thing that made the first 100 million users install a web browser -- was the ability to publish and consume text, images and links.  Since then of course the web has become an ""application-delivery platform"" while remaining the most important and popular way to publish text, images and links on internet.<p>Although I freely concede that making it into an application-delivery platform had large benefits, it also had the adverse effect of making its use for its original purpose more confusing, more frustrating, more tedious, less secure and less reliable, which is a thing to be regretted because there is much utility and promise in its original purpose of giving people a convenient and inexpensive way to publish and consume text, images and links on the internet.<p>I wish the people who wanted a platform on which to deliver applications over the internet -- a platform neither owned or controlled by any single corporation, which I freely admit was a worthy goal -- had found some other way to get their wish without making so many headaches for the people whose goal is to use the internet to publish or consume text, images and links.<p>Although it is nice that this second set of people have the opportunity to learn this new health-monitoring subsystem of Firefox, it would have been <i>even better</i> if the software for viewing text and images and for following links were uncomplicated and reliable enough to make a new health-monitoring subsystem unnecessary.<p>So, to answer your question directly, yes, there is an alternative to viewing websites in a complex, general-purpose browser other than downloading ""website"" apps to run locally.  Namely, it is the alternative that existed in 1994 when web pages were not executable programs.  Their being ""just plain documents"" rather than executable programs drastically limited the kinds of things that could go wrong.
Another alternative would to persuade the online publishers of 2013 to move to a new system that does not double as an application-delivery platform and consequently does not suffer the reliability and other problems that the web has.  (Yes, I know that is very unlikely to happen.)<p>May I suggest that if you want to continue this conversation, you switch it to email?  My address is in my profile.",1368594204

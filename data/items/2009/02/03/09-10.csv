463761,comment,463601,463601,0,0,patio11,,,"I mostly sell downloadable software but as of a week ago it is a web application if you squint at it.<p>Support is via email, and my general promise about it is ""I do my level best to get back to you within 24 hours"", which I achieve with approximately 98% regularity.  (My price point just doesn't support phone calls.  Happily I'm overseas from most of my customers, which is a great way to convince them to play ball on that issue.)<p>I love talking to customers but I hate doing support, because that means someone is having a less than optimal experience.  Well, two someones, since writing email is no more optimal use of my time than waiting for my email is optimal use of theirs.<p>Accordingly, I spend a lot of time stopping support incidents before they start.  This means writing and rewriting and re-re-rewriting copy in the web and application to be more comprehensible, illustrating things with pictures, and providing people with self-help options.<p>Example: a fairly key issue with downloadable software is getting people their registration key.  It gets emailed when they purchase.  But some people don't get it (spam filters, customer error, etc).  So I displayed it after checkout, with instructions on what to do.  But some people won't get it (failure to click through to last page, customer error, Internet failures, etc).  So I provided instructions before the event (to check the spam folder) and provided a registration key lookup feature.  I also made the app sniff registration keys off of the clipboard, which squashes many copy/paste issues before they start.  (There are NUMEROUS ways for an unsophisticated user to fail at copy/paste.)<p>I keep categorized records of what causes issues and how many I get.  (I worked in Customer Support a long time ago, and old habits die hard.)  Relative to the number of sales, its down about 90% compared to my first year in business.  I still have lots of room for improvement -- I'm thinking of a way to totally eliminate registration key entry for most users in the next version, for example.  (It is fairly easy after you have web connectivity baked in.)",1233654517

463759,comment,463234,463389,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"Yes and No.<p>It isn't just propaganda anymore. Pure CSS is what you're going to see in almost every code base you might work on. The last several gigs I've had wouldn't even allow tables for tabular data, which I think is ridiculous.<p>If I were reviewing your code, I'd give you points for using tables to deal with tabular data. I might not even hold it against you if you used it in a layout, depending on context. Unfortunately the person reviewing your markup will probably expect pure CSS, even if it is data displayed in a table format. Adjust your expectations accordingly.",1233654411

463757,comment,463515,463515,0,0,uberc,,,"In the end, ""be good"" makes perfect business sense in a free-market economy. In the past, it was easier to get away without being good due to local distribution monopolies and the high barriers to entry in specific industries, reducing overall competition. In the Internet age, it's increasingly the case that there is an open, fluid, highly competitive market, thanks to decreasing distribution costs barriers to entry. Thus you've got to ""be good"" to compete.",1233654144
463756,comment,463549,463583,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Education is a very large market, not sure what all that money was for, but obviously they did a very good job of selling the project.<p>The fact that they didn't manage to get a second round (and that's a fact that is now very well published) could be due to any number of reasons, such as missing critical goals that they've set in their original presentation and/or changes in the marketplace. It's hard to tell what the real cause is without asking the 8 angel investors involved.<p>Drawing far reaching conclusions ('angels flee from tech start-ups') from a single sample is not very solid science.<p>One possible reasons why angel investors are holding back is because of their stock portfolios taking a huge hit.<p>I also don't see not wanting to invest for a second round as 'pulling out', and I think the fact that all 8 responded unanimously says a lot more about 'twosmartdogs' (what a name) than it does about the investors.<p>They've had their shot, now they will either have to swim or sink. It's not different for the rest of us, with or without outside investors.",1233654137

Perhaps the Italian government has no real intention of punishing individuals, but just wants to make a stink about this to try to scare UGC sites into being responsible for their content. The impossibility of extradition gives them cover. If they named Italian Google executives or employees, which I'm guessing they easily could have, they'd actually have to put people in jail and face the absurdity of these changes in a very concrete way.",1233653800

Comparing sites at #1 on the search results for different phrases there's often little correlation between traffic from those keywords and what the keyword tool predicts.  It's a good starting point for experimenting, say to get ideas for A/B testing, but I wouldn't put a lot of money towards something based solely on its results.",1233653261

I could bucket test the features I want to add, a few at a time. When I am ""done"" with the new version, I could then release as a new product and invite users to pay an upgrade fee -- with the caveat that the old version will stop receiving support/etc after a given date in the future (or perhaps even charge for support after that date in such a way it makes more economic sense to switch).<p>I may make an addendum to this post when I am slightly more lucid in the morning.<p>P.S.

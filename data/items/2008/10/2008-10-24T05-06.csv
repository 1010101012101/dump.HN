342125,comment,341971,341971,0,0,cbrinker,,,"Never heard of the guy before. I checked out his bio on Wikipedia and it says this:<p>""After being arrested for grand theft in Sacramento, CA and given 60 hours of community service, Steve claims that this was the impetus he needed to turn his life around. He claims to have earned two college degrees in three semesters from California State University, Northridge - he says that he partly achieved this by attending a college that was generous in awarding advanced placement credits for courses he had taken in high school, thus reducing his required course.""<p>The citation links to his article where he claims he did 30-40 units per semester and no summer school. I don't know, that sounds pretty ridiculous to me. Very hard for me to believe he earned 2 degrees in 3 semester on technical subjets of mathematics and comp sci.",1224827750

You sound like you've got interesting things to say about every item. Come up with a practical example (preferably but not necessarily a real one) for each, and you've got a decent read on your hands.<p>Hustle, hustle, hustle!  ;)",1224826991
342123,comment,341604,341701,0,0,senihele,,,"I'm not sure about your last point.  It seems there are some extremely important implications from the determination that ""black swan"" events are often of incalculable risk.  I already posted the link farther down the thread, so I won't repost it, but I highly recommend reading the article - it is written by Taleb and reframes this concept in terms of the current crisis.  It really is one of the most interesting high level overviews of the problem I have come across.",1224826945

Get a part time job, go polyphasic.  You'll suddenly have plenty of time to work on your own stuff, work part-time, and still have a social life.",1224826704

342116,comment,319889,320083,0,0,eptiger,,,"I didn't mean to cut out from the loop the developers who have been making a lot of money from the app store with their great apps. And Apple can do whatever the hell they want with the iPhone, it doesn't belong to developers. That being said, it's just not fair for them to be so completely arbitrary in how they run the app store. Is it legal? Of course. There's nothing wrong with it, it just doesn't make sense.<p>When you have the potential to make even more money on a great product and make the user experience better and bring in even more users in the process, why wouldn't you? Yes, it does remove the control that Apple has had over their products and, arguably, has kept the quality of their products at a high level, but they're not doing the best job of filtering so that bad apps don't get in the app store so it simply doesn't make sense.",1224826563

I am in a similar situation and have felt pretty uncomfortable assigning different weights to each of the founders, but I can relate to your situation where different members are contributing different amounts of time.  One thing I was a little unclear about - what is the ""total vanilla"" line about?  Thanks!",1224826316
342112,comment,319889,320028,0,0,eptiger,,,"First of all, there is no google phone :) Let's be fair to Google, there's Android and then there's the G1. I don't have a high opinion of the G1.<p>Yes, in an ideal world openmoko would go head-to-head with the iPhone OS and it'd have a better interface and all that stuff. However, it will probably never be something mainstream users will want or care about. Android is the closest thing we have right now to be a rich, open mobile platform that will be on phones that a lot of people will actually buy and want to have. Until around the time the iPhone came out, people hated their phones, by and large. I give credit to Apple, though they do not get sole credit, for helping stimulate more innovation in cell phones.<p>Anyway, my point was that Android actually stands a chance against the iPhone OS but it's not a done deal and we still need good hardware for it. Ultimately, I want it to cause Apple to loosen up on these stoic principles behind the app store.",1224826163
342111,comment,342001,342001,0,0,Caligula,,,"The design is nice.  One suggestion would be to better mimic the ui/colors/look and feel of WoW's ingame ui.  Also add some sort of clan feature where someone can register a clan that they could also use as their clan/guild website so like a facebook group.<p>But disturbing too...  A social network where instead of being about the users personal life, it is about a video game character they play.  Luckily there are a boatload of people whose lives evolve around WoW so it could  do very well.",1224826052

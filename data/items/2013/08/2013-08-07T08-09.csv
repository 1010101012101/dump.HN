6171623,comment,6165315,6166137,2,0,chriswarbo,,,"Most digital physics proposals seem to be unfalsifiable, but there are exceptions.<p>For example, statistical Physics tells us that a system can be full of complex, random fluctuations, but it can still be &#x27;stable&#x27; if those fluctuations cancel each other out. Boltzmann hypothesised that we could just be a random fluctuation in some otherwise stable system (perhaps a vast cloud of gas). This hypothesis is falsifiable, since large fluctuations are far less likely than small fluctuations. It&#x27;s very unlikely that the room I&#x27;m in, including me, is a fluctuation in a gas cloud, but the anthropic principle says that I wouldn&#x27;t notice all those small fluctuations which don&#x27;t produce me. If I am a fluctuation then I can predict that it&#x27;s <i>incredibly</i> likely that the fluctuation is limited to this room, as anything larger would be far less likely. However, when I step outside I find a whole city, which falsifies the hypothesis. Likewise we can observe a whole planet, solar system, galaxy, local group, cosmic web, etc. which goes exactly against the predictions of the fluctuation hypothesis.<p>However, from a digital physics perspective we can get the opposite result. Let&#x27;s hypothesise that we&#x27;re running on a giant Turing Machine and our program is a random fluctuation on its tape; ie. a random series of bit flips on an otherwise empty tape. Since small fluctuations are vastly more likely than large fluctuations, we would expect to be part of a small program rather than a large one. Again, the anthropic principle says that I&#x27;ll never observe tiny programs that don&#x27;t produce me, but what can I say about tiny programs which do produce me? Well, randomness and asymmetry is hard to produce using a computer program: it must be encoded as part of the program, since it can&#x27;t be produced spontaneously. Hence I would predict small programs to have less randomness and asymmetry than large programs, so I would predict a symmetric and uniform Universe, which is largely what we see.<p>One falsifiable prediction of such a digital physics theory is that quantum phenomena are actually pseudorandom, ie. deterministic and predictable, since the only way to encode unpredictable values in a program is to write them out bit-for-bit in the source. A pseudorandom number generator would require far fewer bits, and hence is more likely; also, a smaller pseudorandom number generator is more likely than a large one. If we find that quantum phenomena cannot be predicted by any short program, we can falsify this hypothesis.",1375865914

6171594,comment,6165708,6167146,8,0,noivad,,,"I take it that you are unaware of the concept of defense in-depth, because your argument is essentially: well if they can come in the front door, then they can open the garage & steal my car too easy, so putting lock on the doors would make people think their car was secure. To enable a person to lock the car door would be silly because once a person has access to your house, they own everything in it. While no security measure is perfect, and with enough motivation & resources anything can be cracked, making things a bit more difficult with master password locking, etc. will stop casual security breaches: I.e. a boyfriend/girlfriend finds out their SO uses Chrome, so he/she steals their SOs passwords from Chrome in seconds to later use against them after a break up, or to monitor them, etc. This happened (to a friend of mine BTW) and had Chrome had a master password, the SO would never have been able to do it because most people do not have the resources available to do it, an those people are the most irresponsible with having access. 
This thought that by making something less secure, you are in fact helping the user from having a false beliefthat they are secureis an ignorant decision at best because nothing is secure, but things can be more secure. & from I have learned balancing convenience & security usually falls somewhere between. a 5 second to breach to breach security policy (Chrome) is no where near (the standard) 5 seconds to unlock by typing in a master pass with a default 10 minute idle lock.<p>Basically, you are fighting ignorance with even greater ignorant decisions.",1375865264
6171593,comment,6171346,6171346,7,0,weland,,,"Many, many years ago, when words printed on dead trees were not only for hipsters, I used to work for a computer magazine (the printed kind).<p>Our editor-in-chief was this old-school guy in his fifties, with quite a few years of journalistic experience and with a ferocious attention to details and exigence. When he was brought in, the first thing he did was mail us a list of things that were unacceptable and would promptly result in ending collaboration if they were repeated.<p>I kept it for future reference, and this article meets about one third of the points there, including:<p>1. Not talking about anything that happened, but instead talking about a lot of things that <i>could</i> happen. Go write for a SF magazine if you want that.<p>2. Mention every possible debate on the subject, without attempting to either offer a conclusion or a new set of arguments for any of them. People who do that after they&#x27;re twenty were too busy being teacher&#x27;s pets in college to get drunk, smoke weed and rant. Go get high or something.<p>3. Bringing a lot of arguments for something that you do not explicitly mention. If your material is argumentative in nature, state what you are arguing for in the first few phrases, in a coherent form. Don&#x27;t let people guess what you&#x27;re arguing for and <i>especially</i> don&#x27;t imply it in the title. That&#x27;s for wimps who want to make noise, but are too afraid to clearly express their opinions.<p>4. Excessive use of terms that are reserved for probability or possibility. It&#x27;s tempting to write these off as a stylistic device, but they are rarely actually needed; excessive use betrays lack of serious research, of which the author is unconsciously aware, but he is too haughty to admit it. Go check your sources, make a list of things you&#x27;re sure of and things you aren&#x27;t sure of, and see #1 for what to do with those that you aren&#x27;t sure of.<p>(This is a true gem, there&#x27;s a whole paragraph of things that may or may not be true, but who knows: &quot;With no banking or government involvement, Bitcoin may be anonymous. It may even be ideal for someone who intentionally tries not to pay tax. That may be a small piece of the Bitcoin payment universe. But for most people who file tax returns and report their income whether or not it shows up on a Form W-2 or 1099, it probably isnt the tax haven some are suggesting it is.&quot;)<p>5. Lack of a conclusion that either proves or disproves your original argument. If your conclusion is not about your point, you&#x27;re sticking it in the wrong article and you just screwed up <i>two</i> of them.<p>This is tabloid material.",1375865246

So any static analysis you&#x27;re comfortable with can be great for making up some of the slack, but let&#x27;s not pretend that in most cases we shouldn&#x27;t now need to be writing those tests to check it does what it&#x27;s meant to.<p>The place where this approach sometimes falls short is on the public API boundary, as I mentioned in my other post. Types can be useful there, so maybe my original assertion was a little too strong, but still types should very rarely mean less tests.<p>(Apologies if the post is a bit all over the place, redrafting on a phone is hard)",1375864726

For a short route, most of your time is spent a lot altitudes, so the prop is going to be a lot more efficient.  Saves fuel, makes it cheaper to fly, thus lower fares.<p>Single engine aircraft have been shown to be essentially as safe as twins, at least on light aircraft like these.  Engines very rarely fail, and a twin engine light craft failing often fails in a way where the plane still is unflyable, or the pilots of those aircraft aren&#x27;t able to recover (more of an issue for private single pilots vs. a charter with two).  There are some ways where it doesn&#x27;t matter how many engines the aircraft has, and the twin engines add complexity which increase the odds of problems (which generally cause ground stops or non-crash incidents, but which could possibly cause crashes).  Twins also cost more per hour to operate (in fuel, and especially maintenance), and cost more to buy.  Inexperienced pilots also manage to crash aircraft with two working engines by doing stupid things with the engines, where they may not in a single, although this is less of an issue with FADEC I think.<p>For a long flight over the ocean, a big twin turbofan ETOPS certified or maybe even a trijet or 4-engine aircraft is the way to go, but for short domestic flights over land, a single (turboprop, ideally, but even some pistons) would be my choice.

Profit is prize minus cost. This goes somewhat in the direction of the targeting a market and engineering the product accordingly. But by regarding the actual selling prize of a product as given instead of the actual production cost changes a lot. And your not done by just engineering a product to a certain prize, if the market changes you have to improve your cost base.<p>And the more your product is a commodity, the more important this part of prizing gets as it is harder to boost prizes in this case.

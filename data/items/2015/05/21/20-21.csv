If anything, they way you&#x27;ve phrased it is backward: <i>first</i> we find a new treatment (via research) and once it gives us an action to perform, <i>then</i> we can justify the screening. If catching a cancer earlier helps, screen. If not (prostate or breast screenings too early in life), don&#x27;t.<p>Obviously if you have family history, risk factors, or something with high specificity like a BRCA mutation, you treat.

There are also so many external factors that go into a diagnosis and recommendation that a simple scan can never give the whole story.

It does not allow web pages to read the clipboard (which would be a security violation, and what comes to mind when you say &quot;hijacking&quot;), only to write to it.<p>2. Browsers can already trap clicks and keys to override standard copy functionality, so if you&#x27;re worried about Tynt-style stuff, this doesn&#x27;t change that equation at all.<p>3. The only effect of this is that it lets sites overwrite your clipboard when you don&#x27;t signal that you want to copy something.  Which they could already do today if you have Flash.<p>So... at worst, that counts as a minor annoyance. And since most sites aren&#x27;t actively hostile to their users, it&#x27;s not likely to be widely-misused, and it&#x27;s more likely that it&#x27;ll be used for its intended purpose -- making it easy for users to copy, say, big wodges of code to the clipboard with a single click.<p>The proposed solution to this non-problem would make this feature so cumbersome it might as well not exist, on its way to solving a problem that in practice will almost never be seen.",1432241611

Idealized models are useful in understanding the underlying factors at work in a real situation, even if the real situation contains other factors that are not modeled. Often you can add those other factors in as constraints (for example, there&#x27;s no reason why a microeconomic model has to assume &quot;no minimal sustenance&quot;; you just add the minimum requirement for sustenance as a constraint). Or you can expand the model to include interactions that were not previously captured (for example, if waste disposal is a significant factor, you can expand your model to include the economic transactions involved).",1432241610
9585319,comment,9582572,9584553,0,0,SovietDissident,,,"The U.S. can get away with our inflationary monetary policy shenanigans because we (still) have legacy reserve currency status in the world.  Currently, banks are being paid interest to keep money in government coffers, so they have no interest in lending it (the economy is also weak, which is likely a factor as well).  We do have inflationary pressure in the U.S., which is probably underreported due to the CPI being taken out of official figures.  In the event that there was meaningful GDP growth in the U.S., high inflation would likely be part and parcel.<p>If we didn&#x27;t have carte blanche in terms of printing all the money we wanted, the pressure would be all on fiscal policy, as it is in Greece.  An apt comparison could be U.S. state governments, where they must maintain a balanced budget.<p>Either you can inflate your currency (which destroys savings), you can increase taxes (which negatively affects growth), or you can cut spending to actually match what comes in.  The U.S. has the luxury to do the former for a while thanks to rational monetary and fiscal policy (long) in our past and the fact that our economy is still relatively productive.  We are living on borrowed time in this regard.  Greece does not have the luxury, and has reached the inevitable end of collectivist economic policy.",1432241605

The second sentence should be interpreted in the context of this first sentence: if you try to emulate Unix&#x27;s primitive with Windows&#x27;, and especially if you want to do this and write a user-level scheduler that does not occasionally deadlock without reason, you will get stuck in a couple of places.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that Windows&#x27; philosophy does not give you optimal performance in PyParallel. It simply means that OCaml had chosen for its low-level system primitives a Unix model and that it was difficult to make a Windows version of the same primitives so that OCaml programmers could write this kind of program portably between Windows and Unix.<p>NOTE: without, at the time it is in my timezone, looking up the full post, I have to say that I don&#x27;t think that the quoted two sentences have anything to do with the discussion. It seems to me that the two sentences assume that a multicore (multiprocessor, at the time the post was written) OCaml runtime is not available, and discusses the options to still provide threads. A user-level scheduler is one option to provide threads to OCaml programs without a concurrent OCaml runtime. Another option is to use Windows&#x27; native threads and superior philosophy for blocking primitives to run each OCaml thread as a native thread (although at most one of these will be running at any given time. All the others will be waiting on the heap mutex).<p>OCaml ended up providing threads under Windows <i>and</i> a Unix-like “Unix” module around 1996-ish, way before the linked discussion. So thanks for the explanation about VMS, but I think it is off-topic, too.<p>NOTE 2: I have now read the original post. You should, too. It starts with:<p>> Threads have at least three different purposes:<p>><p>> 1- Parallelism on shared-memory multiprocessors.<p>> 2- Overlapping I/O and computation (while a thread is blocked on a network<p>>   read, other threads may proceed).<p>>3- Supporting the &quot;coroutine&quot; programming style<p>>   (e.g. if a program has a GUI but performs long computations,<p>>    using threads is a nicer way to structure the program than<p>>    trying to wrap the long computation around the GUI event loop).<p>><p>> The goals of OCaml threads are (2) and (3) but not (1) (for reasons<p>> that I&#x27;ll get into later)<p>What makes it relevant to the current discussion is (1), but Xavier is discussing (2) and (3) at the time of the quote you chose to take out of context.",1432241468

The degree to which he was dead on in those early cyberpunk novels almost seems supernatural.<p>He did get the geography a little off... California is more like his Sprawl, and China is more like his Japan. What&#x27;s happening in the Middle East with ISIS and such seems not far off from the brutal nihilistic European war hinted at as part of the world&#x27;s back-story in Neuromancer.<p>It&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing. Gibson&#x27;s work is frequently quite dystopian. Seems to me that he achieves his remarkable prescience by being optimistic about technological development but pessimistic about politics, economics, and human social evolution. In Gibson&#x27;s worlds we&#x27;re clever and good at building things but fail miserably in areas like self-examination, self-awareness, and social reform... basically we&#x27;re just animals with big brains.",1432241413

There is no inherent performance penalty in synchronous approach, it&#x27;s just the runtime systems of many popular languages make it so - statically allocated stack, and some penalty of context switch via system call. In addition to the languages mentioned in the article (Go, Clojure core.async, Erlang), Gambit Scheme deserves to be mentioned, winch can spawn millions of lightweight (green) threads. Also there was Stackless Python.<p>BTW, no need to describe the implementation in terms of continuations. It&#x27;s just enough (I think) to allocate function activation records on heap instead of statically allocated stack. (AFAIK continuations are also implemented similarly, although what I&#x27;ve read about Go, their call stack management is something more complex)<p>Also, I think the &quot;actor model&quot; is not the final solution for scalable distributed programming, it&#x27;s just some initial, and IMHO pretty clumsy step.

Or have a master that manages workers and communicates with ZMQ, HTTP, TCP, IPC, etc. Or use a library that does it all for you like parmap, Async Parallel, etc etc.<p>I work on the Hack language typechecker at Facebook. The typechecker is written in OCaml, and since it needs to operate on the scale of Facebook&#x27;s codebase (tens of millions of lines of code), it&#x27;s a pretty performance-sensitive program. We needed real parallelism, but doing it with fork() and IPC was too costly for us, both in terms of storage (if you aren&#x27;t careful you end up duplicating a bunch of data) and CPU (serializing/deserializing OCaml data structures to send over IPC is CPU-intensive).<p>We ended up doing something somewhat more interesting. Before we fork(), we mmap a MAP_ANON|MAP_SHARED region of memory -- that region will be backed by the same physical frames in each child after we fork, so writes to it in one child process will be visible in the others. We use a little bit of C code to safely manage the shared-memory concurrency here.<p>The code for this all open source (along with the rest of the typechecker, HHVM runtime, etc) if you want to take a look: <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/hack/src/heap/hh_shared.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/hack/src/h...</a><p>I also gave a tech talk a while ago on internals of the type system and typechecker; the latter part starts here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN22-V-b8RM&feature=youtu.be&t=39m"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN22-V-b8RM&feature=youtu.be...</a>",1432239559

The tech is still pretty primitive and some people are more readily able to accept it than others (there&#x27;s a good bit of research recently that shows there is even a hormonal influence). But it&#x27;s not just a graphics gimmick. It&#x27;s really a completely different way of thinking about applications.<p>To me, it literally feels like I&#x27;m wearing the program. Not the display. The program. Once exploited properly (and I admit, we&#x27;re fairly far away from that), we will be doing things in it that will make 2D, external displays too unbearably difficult to use.<p>I mean, <i>at the very least</i>, we&#x27;re going to see a sea-change in how 3D content is authored. It&#x27;s going to massively drive down the cost of creating high-quality 3D models. It&#x27;s going to make it more accessible, which means it&#x27;s going to be used more often for things other than just games.<p>I personally think stereo displays and hand-tracking are a necessary developments to enable in-the-home 3D printing. 3D modeling on a 2D display is too hard for most people to do for even trivial tasks. But we will <i>eventually</i> see a decent modeling program created for an HMD. SketchUp was close, this is going to push it over the edge by making the manipulations far more intuitive.<p>The closest analogy I have is the difference of going from a text-based adventure interface to a 3D, first-person RPG interface. This is the next step after that. I&#x27;ve gone back and played Skyrim in the Oculus Rift, a game I&#x27;ve spent countless hours in, and been re-amazed at the chance to see such familiar places in literally a whole new way.<p>Minecraft-style graphics on an HMD feel more real, feel more like being there, than Crysis 2 on the highest settings on an 2D display, more real than watching an IMAX 3D movie. Having experienced a few &quot;tourism&quot; apps, the feeling is closer on the spectrum of reality to that of being there than that of watching it on TV.

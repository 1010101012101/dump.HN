To think that there aren't offline hunts and people who go around shouting those things without the internet is absurd. To suggest this is why we need internet censorship easily lends its self to the argument that people's every day offline lives need to be monitored and controlled.<p>When you stand on a street corner shouting This guy did it with a picture of said guy, how many people do you reach as compared to a similar post on Reddit?<p>Conversely, what is the status of other mass-media (newspapers, radio, TV etc.) regarding the information they publish? Will a radio ever broadcast This guy did it without some fact-checking? At least here (Germany), that is not/should not be the case.<p>The very easy way to solve this problem would obviously be to improve defamation/libel laws to such an extend that wrongfully accusing someone of X gets you the maximum penalty for X as a minimum.

They use indexing of archived data, similar to how google indexes everything (they don't use google). They also use indexed files to keep track of some data, but most of it is about users+permissions, not much to do with data.<p>I don't feel I can give further details, but the company is making money, nothing you'd read about, but it's doing OK. Solution scales up so that insurance and financial companies are their clients. Terabytes of data - no big deal, it's quite amazing to see how much faster it runs on customer's computers with terabytes of data, than in house with test-databases on developer's PC's with only 100 MB of test data. And it doesn't even require an admin (besides someone to make sure there's enough space on disk).<p>I think it really depends on your app. Databases aren't always the right answer, but no one has been fired for using databases.

In the moment where he lost momentum and looked around for a next step, the world ""branched out"" into a space composed of choices. This is the one more little attempt to show people what ""code as art"" can mean.<p>- The realization that (possible spoilers) the last third of the book is the story of how he found himself working at a start-up.

Real property has intrinsic value, and being a limited commodity means that prices for it will rise by virtue of the fact that it is a limited commodity. Stock is limited as well, but because it has no intrinsic value its price doesn't increase imply by virtue of its being a limited commodity.<p>Forget about price for a second and look at intrinsic value. What is the underlying asset represented by ownership of property? It's the right to exclusively use some land and accompanying buildings. What is the underlying asset represented by stock? Leaving aside different kinds of stock, it's generally the right to receive a certain percentage of the profits of a company over time. Now, look at how price changes in the two assets are correlated with changes in the intrinsic value of the assets. A plot on the UES might appreciate 50% between 2000 and 2013, even though the neighborhood hasn't really changed in that time. The use and enjoyment a given person gets from that property is the same in 2000 and 2013. Now, compare to a stock. If the price of a stock appreciates 50% between 2000 and 2013, it's generally because the company has increased profits. Your enjoyment of the $150 in stock in 2013 is higher than your enjoyment of the $100 in stock in 2000 because it represents the same percentage of the right to receive a larger amount of profits.",1366379328

I think that many queries can look simpler in Pony than in Pewee.<p>For example, if I want to retrieve all pairs of different users with the same name, in Pony this query would look as follow:<p><pre><code>    select((u1, u2) for u1 in User for u2 in User if u1.name == u2.name and u1 != u2)
</code></pre>
In Peewee, this query probably would look something like this (didn't test it):<p><pre><code>    User2 = User.alias()
    User.select(User, User2).join(User2).where((User.name == User2.name) & (User.id != User2.id))
</code></pre>
Its probable the matter of taste, but I like Pony syntax better. Another example is taken from the Peewee doc:<p><pre><code>    staff_users = User.select().where(is_staff=True)
    Tweet.select().where(~(Tweet.user << staff_users))
</code></pre>
In Pony, this query would look as follow:<p><pre><code>    select(t for t in Tweet if t.user not in (u for u in User if u.is_staff))
    </code></pre>
Also, this simple version is possible, don't know why it is not as simple in Peewee<p><pre><code>    select(t for t in tweet if not t.user.is_staff)
</code></pre>
Also, I dont know if Peewee supports IdentityMap and optimistics transactions.<p>On there other side, it seems Peewee already has migration support, whereas in Pony migrations are not implemented yet, this is the next task.",1366378883
5576561,comment,5575144,5575144,5,0,danielna,,,"I think part of the problem here is that many devs often don't understand how much power they yield over their own situation.  If you're good enough to be depended upon in every panic situation, that means you have more say than you think in the circumstances surrounding your work -- specifically regarding pay, scope creep, working environment, etc.  If you don't assert yourself nobody will coddle you, because that's how capitalism works.  The goal of the company is to maximize profits, but the cost (both time and $) in finding a talented, hard-working employee is huge and employers know that.  So you have to stand up for yourself because you hold more cards than you think.  If you have a passive personality where you never push back and don't stand up for yourself you will get completely rolled over.<p>I've met devs who only consider one side of the employee-employer agreement -- ""don't get fired, don't get fired, don't get fired.""  What about the other side?  ""If ___ quits, we are screwed.""<p>This is the reason why we invest in our skills, this is why we read things like HN, this is why we make ourselves indispensable.  Because a higher level of skill, both technically, socially and in business, not only makes you a greater employee, but it gives you more autonomy over your own circumstances.<p>I don't agree with the comments here that encourage people to half-ass their 9-5 because ""you owe the company nothing.""  I encourage you to do the opposite -- become so good at what you do that they can't ignore you.  Be such a valuable perspective/contributor/asset that they shudder at the thought of losing you.

The reason for that is that traditionally it is difficult to decide for a server that is serving multiple domains, which SSL certificate to show for a client -- the HTTP header, which contains the hostname is sent way after the certificate information has been exchanged.<p>A certificate can contain several hostnames (in the SubjectAlternativeName extension) - but that does not scale if you have a big number of sites for a number of reasons (re-signing the certificate all the time is a nuisance, browser behavior with certificates containing several thousand hostnames is kind of fun, etc.).<p>Nowadays there are solutions to that problem (using the Server Name Indication TLS extension -- which basically sends the desired hostname in the TLS exchange before the certificate is exchanged). However, the number of sites actively using SNI is very low - google is the only site known to me that is doing it (try accessing google.com with/without SNI and you will get completely different certificates).<p>The reason why SNI is not yet that much used is that client support is still a bit flaky. Afaik it is supported by all recent desktop browsers. However, I think the XP TLS stack does not support it (and there are still enough users on that), android only supports it starting with version 3.0, etc.<p>So - at the moment you basically still need a separate IP for each site (or at least one IP for sites that can share one certificate).<p>I don't know if akamai also supports custom SSL certificates. Facebook seems to use kind of an interesting mix between akamai and self-hosting - facebook.com itself seems to be hosted by facebook. However, if you use facebook over ssl and check the url of served profile pictures, you will see that they go to <a href=""https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net</a> (or similar) -- hence to one of the hostnames that is mentioned in the akamai edge certificates.",1366377559

It's not a consequence of ""small government"", it's that the project will fail (or, worse, just not die already) regardless of funding. Such projects are better run by those with an incentive to succeed at low cost, who can afford to find & hire people good at making such projects succeed, and who will soon suffer significant consequences if they don't.<p>Of course the infrastructure gets scooped up with peanuts. Insofar as it exists, those running it are unable to complete it or operate it, much less break even. Best to consider it ""sunk costs"" needed to jump-start private completion & operation thereof where the startup cost was prohibitive. Google had no incentive to put an awesome network in that particular town until the municipality basically gave Google $39M to make it happen.<p>This notion of ""we don't know anything about the subject, but we can do it faster, better, and cheaper than somebody who gets paid very well to do it"" must be eradicated from governmental thinking, both because it's stupid for obvious reasons, and subject to abuse by those who see great profit therein. Don't confuse legitimate opportunistic taking over a failing project with illegitimate opportunistic creation of the problem: I doubt Google was pulling strings behind the scenes in Provo Utah just so they could get $39M of infrastructure for a buck; far more likely the town discovered the hard way they didn't know squat about implementing and operating a broadband WAN at any price, and realized the best way to salvage their failing investment was to sell it to someone who <i>does</i> know for $1.<p>It's kinda like the old joke about home repair pricing of ""$100/hr to do the job, $200/hr if you tried to do it yourself first"".",1366377389

Don't mix the two. (You'll either cut the self-directed stuff and burn out, or give your job responsibilities the shaft and at zero, you might actually get fired.)

That's why spending more time on something yields results.  The trick is to focus on one thing at a time.<p>Grr, damn man.  Your reply really gets under my skin for some reason.  I wasn't saying the above because I thought I was -better- or anything like that.  I was hoping to motivate one person into doing something they ordinarily wouldn't have.  <p>Thanks for the downvote though, I appreciate it.  I rewarded it with an upvote.",1182826369

30671,comment,30659,30659,0,0,acmegeek,,,"Well, compared to Bruce's Blowfish, it too is symmetric with a variable key length. What is different about ColorBlynd is that the block length can vary and the number of blocks within the key varies as well.<p>What this does is add a ""meta key"" beyond simply knowing the key. The meta key includes how the key is broken down into blocks. And the number of blocks is used during each round relative to the block length.<p>So if you know the exact key, but don't know how many blocks there are or how many bits per block, you wouldn't know that you had the entire key.<p>The whole color deal is a neat way to transport the key and the cipertext, but it isn't integral to the algorithm.<p>The actual algorithm can be succinctly described in 4 sentences.<p>I'd definitely like to have Bruce look at it, but I'm not sure how to convince him to check it out. If anybody here knows him personally and thinks this might be worth his time, please forward him this thread.",1182826120

It would take a lot more time than ""normal"". <p>I wonder if that much forethought might save more time than would be otherwise spent on development and testing?<p>Kind of like the adage of ""cut twice, measure once"".",1182825024

30663,comment,30659,30659,0,0,acmegeek,,,"I believe the basic algorithm is truly novel. The usage of colors is a little bit of a gimmick, but is an interesting way to store data. <p>I'm just not sure what I could use it for or if anyone might be interested in it. <p>One interesting aspect is that the algorithm is very dependent on the bit length of each chunk of the key as well as how many chunks there are. Almost like there is a meta-key.<p>Without this knowledge, even if you were to guess the entire key correctly, decryption fails without any indication that you were close.<p>As noted at the bottom of the page, I came up with the basic algorithm in 2002. I was researching several other cryptosystems and it was one of those ""eureka"" type moments. <p>So, any ideas, comments, criticism, or whatever is welcome.",1182824592

30657,comment,30652,30652,0,0,acmegeek,,,"I think that initially, it is hard to develop both clean code and good UI simultaneously. At least in my experience, in developing a hybrid CMS/shopping framework from scratch, I had no specs to start from, so it was a fairly intense iterative process.<p>I would start with some functionality, ugly as it may be and then switch over to work on the code for a while. I would then look for common code areas and try to come up with functions or classes that were as general as possible. Some might say I'm too picky about leaving things to generalized, but even though my codebase is 90% procedural, I and others have little problems, debugging and/or adding functionality.<p>I also took great care to generalize as much of the UI as possible. Even though there aren't too many objects in play, sweeping presentation changes in both layout and style are fairly easy.<p>I guess, to answer your question, an intuitive user interface takes time, as does clean reusable code. A programmer who is disciplined to see the value in both would most likely be able to start a new project with both in place. Unless you have done it before, it will take time and you will mostly likely fall towards one side. <p>I have done most of my coding solo, but I suspect that in a team, the most important keys to success, aside from technical excellence, would be clear communication and a well-defined goal.  <p>Really short answer, you can have both, but you need relevant experience, good communication, a clear goal, and the ever elusive time.",1182823492

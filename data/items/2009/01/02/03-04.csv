417008,comment,415683,415736,0,0,vitaminj,,,"I confess that I still haven't read all of General Theory (it's sitting on my to-finish bookshelf), but I really found it quite turgid and wouldn't recommend it to anyone without some economics background (not least because it'll put you to sleep). Besides, most of the standard formulations of Keynes' work were done by other people, eg. Hicks-Hansen put together the IS-LM model based on Keynes ramblings.<p>On a scale of turgidity, the General Theory is on a par with ""The Road to Serfdom"" by Keynes' contemporary nemesis Friedrich von Hayek. I willed my way through that one, but a 10 page cliff's notes version would probably have sufficed. On the other hand, Milton Friedman's works are actually pretty good reads (despite my reservations about some of his thought).",1230868471

417004,comment,416827,416827,0,0,ynniv,,,"The simple reality (IMHO of course) is that people have always used Windows because it was ""what everyone uses"" and ""what the office uses"" and ""what my software runs on"".  If you see it from this perspective, the people who wanted something different have already left to some flavor of UNIX or Mac, so those remaining are looking after their cognitive investment in having learned XP.<p>When you think about it, its amazing that Microsoft continues to sell Windows at all.  Software is free to copy (should the medium break) and never wears out, so if you have purchased and operating system and are happy with it, why should you ever pay for another one?<p>I've been fascinated with Microsoft defenders (fan boys? lackeys? towel boys?) for years, since they seem to gain nothing by promoting the status quo (except for those whose job is subsidized by Microsoft).  So, that everyone has bought a copy of Windows XP, why Microsoft should continue to make revenue?<p>Also, can we please make Linux (or maybe Haiku) a viable desktop OS?  While I don't mind paying Apple a premium for their OS, it must be more efficient overall to have a non-profit develop a free OS once.  Most new OS features at this point are marginally useful eye candy.",1230868083

416983,comment,415683,415683,0,0,vitaminj,,,"I found out that I liked economics shortly after I graduated from engineering, before which I had a completely skewed and cynical view of economics and economists, informed mainly by writers of left-wing books (who generally aren't economists). Fancying myself as a bit of an auto-didact, I tried to self educate. I bought textbooks, read articles from the net, read blogs, etc.<p>But if you're anything like me, then you will skip over all the boring fundamentals and read the more advanced, but interesting sections. Economic literature is written in such a way that the literate layman can be fooled into thinking he understands the material. There are specific terms used by economists (eg. economic profit) that has an entirely different definition than the common one (eg. economic profit takes into account opportunity costs). So I'd be reading these articles thinking that I'm getting it, but really I was missing 50-80% of what the guy was trying to get at, because I just had no idea or training in economic thought.<p>I spent 5 years doing this. There was no watershed moment where I realised this was the wrong way to go about it. Ironically I actually became so interested in economics that I enrolled in a graduate diploma 2 years ago (which is essentially an undergraduate economics degree for people with a degree in something else).<p>In my first semester, I had to correct a shitload of misconceptions that I'd harbored over the years. It was like doing double the work - challenging the material presented against my ill-informed positions, then fact checking and reasoning out which was correct. I was wrong most of the time, but there are positions that I still hold that university economics hasn't beaten out of me (like infant industry protection - for some reason uni economists are all staunchly pro-free trade, and they really only gloss over the alternatives).<p>So 2 years on (and 1 year to go), I feel that I'm in a position to offer some advice about learning (mainstream) economics. If you go the self-learning route:<p>1) Make sure you get a good grounding on the fundamentals of micro and macro. Any uni textbook is probably okay... that free Intro to Economic Analysis book is pretty good (I used it as a second textbook for my intermediate micro class). But the bottom line is read EVERYTHING and don't skip stuff because it's boring. They are often the most important parts...<p>2) A decent book for a general audience is ""Economics in One Lesson"" by Hazlitt. If you don't know what opportunity cost is, then you'll never forget after he's drilled it into your head a thousand times.<p>3) If you're serious about learning econs, I'd steer clear of popular books like Freakonomics and the Logic of Life. They're fun and enjoyable to read, but not particularly rigorous and occasionally quite dodgy.",1230866552

The last else block has no obvious terminator, but it looks like the else is empty because of the comment and the indentation.  So the line after the label cleanUp is the body of the else.  This means that if the if on line 131 is true, the cleanUp code never gets executed.  Now this may be intentional (but I doubt it since the label is named cleanUp), but that should be documented in the code.<p>I consider this use of a goto to be legitimate, since it avoids duplication of the cleanup code (and the last thing you want is to have multiple similar blocks of code that need to be maintained/modified in tandem).  This idiom often appears in the linux kernel IIRC.  But this code is quite terrible since it doesn't use the idiom correctly, produces an unexpected execution path, is a problem to maintain, and is a problem to read.  It seems that it ends up being a no-op since the line after the cleanUp label is a debugging line or something, but that doesn't make this a good practice.<p>But really, this isn't really a problem with the use of goto, it's a problem with the optional braces on single statement blocks in C.  The goto and the label chosen just make it harder to spot.  I've made it a habit to use braces around all blocks, even empty ones, to make the intent clearer and avoid this problem.",1230865235

It took a while until I realized how true this was. Just get something you want to do and keep that in mind when reading the reference. I know most people will start making tons of mistakes and writing really crappy code, but that's exactly what learning is about. Starting out with nothing and getting better. One learns from mistakes. Somehow people tend to forget this. Lots of people seem to be embarrassed making a mistake, causing them to don't do anything at all or not giving in that they are making mistakes. One can't learn that way.<p>I think the article sums it up pretty well and every programmer I know did it that way, well other than learning programming in school, which I myself don't really consider ""learning to program"", because I never met any person that actually learned programming ins school, meaning if they did they didn't ever program again.",1328389174

The site looks bad -- as in, it looks like the Rails 15 minute blog tutorial with a few extra things. This <i>isnt</i> simplicity - this is bare-bones. Simplicity is easy to  use, easy to understand, and beautiful to look at. After I signed up I was immediately thrown into writing a blog post. What? What is this? Am I supposed to write a post? Is it private? Who can see it? You've thrown me into the water when I don't know how to swim, because you assume the life preserver is getting in my way.<p>I don't have a tumblr, but I tried them out today. I was up an running faster than your site - and they don't charge money! They didn't ask for my first or last name, all they asked for was email, password, URL -- all on one page as well.<p>Finally, the fact that your site is so bare-bones, but yet charges money, will cause problems. What's to stop me from building a site very similar to this in a weekend and charging $5/month? Or nothing? I feel it will be extremely hard to have a good business plan with ""we have less features"".",1328389050

I was addressing the majority scenario.<p>First employees in startups are playing a different game; a combination of risk and novelty. The employees are gambling on stock options and a payout (not a particularly rational gamble, of course); but they're also working on new technology, greenfield development, in an exciting environment, often with younger people who are less, shall we say, ""conservative"" in their career trajectory. All of this is utility to such first employees; and it compensates for salary, depending on their utility function.<p>As a company ages, the profile changes.

Cars, today, are like books before the Xerox machine-the only feasible way to make copies was with a special factory.  Copying your car is so hard that it makes little practical difference whether you are allowed to do this. Perhaps someday, through nanotechnology perhaps, a car copier will be developed.   Then a Free Car Movement will be necessary.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.resonancepub.com/rstallman.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.resonancepub.com/rstallman.htm</a>",1328386945

I can give you some free advice based on my own experience developing applications for the android market.<p>First, I see you have published one free app a wednesday, and another a saturday.  In my experience free applications launched friday night have better exposure than midweek. It can deepen on the application, but usually when I launch or update a friday night I get better results all the weekend than launching any other day. It might be the case that there are less applications in the new category to compete, my theory, most updates happen in working days.<p>Secondly, there is no way of knowing what the users want in advance. It seems they are not interested in saving pictures to the SD card or settings a screenshot as a wallpaper. I believe your abstract photo painter is a fun application with bad marketing. You can benefit from a name with more grab. It could even be doing too much: too many effects, too powerful. You could potentially advertise just one effect like ""warhol-ize your friends"", but make it easy. Social might help you: share your patenting on Facebook. Tweet it. whatever at least, change the icon. A smiling female showing your effect can be a good idea. Even the ""mona lisa"". But your current icon looks awful.<p>About Android market SEO. You have long descriptions describing what your application does, which is good. Try to check if there is keywords related to your product on mobile search. This could increase your installs. A good starting point is the adwords keyword tool. You can set the results to only mobile. And don't use generic words on the name of the application unless you are king of the hill. Users searching for wallpapers are not going to notice your ""Wallpaper Share"" among the ton of results.",1328385740

Organizing it must take multiple full-time people. It'd be great to see more programs where students get paid for their work but I want to point out that it's not the only way companies and students are both benefiting from collaboration.<p>I'm at Portland State and we've got a solid six-month capstone program in computer science where local companies, including several in open source, are working with student teams. I know electrical/computer has a similar program with a more hardware focus. It's not that GSOC is the only program where companies work with students, only the most visible.",1328385725

Because maintaining your own email server (which many on HN are perfectly capable of) is a giant pain, especially when you have to deal with SpamAssassin, DKIM, and all of the other things that you need to do correctly to have your email work<p>3. Because I still have my data even if Google loses it I have a backup from downloaded email through Sparrow as well as an entire backup directly from my Gmail through Backupify (<a href=""https://www.backupify.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.backupify.com/</a>)<p>4. Because I like to outsource the tools and services that I need to people that are experts at it. It's the same reason that I use Beanstalk for Subversion instead of hosting my own server, use FreshBooks for invoicing clients instead of doing it myself, and send transactional email through Postmark.<p>It's easier. Much easier. And they are all very good at what they do.<p>Bottom line: So that I don't have to worry about email. It just works, which allows me to do exactly the same thing.",1328385659

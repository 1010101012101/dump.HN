610451,comment,609488,609488,0,0,rdl,,,"I'm much more excited by cheaper rents for residential real estate, or commercial to residential conversion.<p>For an under 20 person startup, a suburban house is actually a pretty ideal office; the only potential problem is neighbors complaining about parking and high foot traffic.  In low budget mode, most of the founders live AND work in the same house, but even later, using the house as an office with crash space, while founders live in other houses, works well.  Plus, rentals on high-end houses are way under mortgage costs, and cheaper per square foot than commercial real estate.  Most of the features people want in a great startup office (private workspaces and larger rooms, great kitchens and bathrooms, rest areas) are present in a house much more than an office.<p>For a zero-stage startup, you have to sleep somewhere anyway, so pooling your housing costs and living together makes sense.  And eliminating the commute is a big win.<p>Las Vegas, with the large supply of high-end houses, 24x7 things to do, and NV's favorable state tax law, might be a great place for a startup.<p>FIOS or metro fiber would be a big plus (or some kind of fixed wireless).<p>The only way I'd take commercial real estate early on is if the business requires a lot of big dumb company client contacts, or if a commercial landlord were willing to take a convertible note or something as payment.<p>I've seen a few angel investors who threw in use of a vacation home as office, too, which works great.",1242392182

One of the reason the blog has some success (i.e. in the quality of the readership) has to do with the fact that I am putting some time in analyzing near real time new preprints on the subject of interest to that community. I am doing this as a hobby. However for this to happen, I am reading these from a laptop or a netbook but neither of these solutions are optimal. I am looking for an E-book reader that can render math expression written in the different pdf preprints I get to download everyday. From an informal gathering of information on the net, it looks like Kindle 1 and 2 do not act as PDF readers. Does any of you have any experience with any other E-books when it comes to reading PDF preprints. I am also looking for the ability to read PDFs without having to do conversion of any kind as I read many papers every day.<p>I also know that I am not the only one in the scientific community that is looking for that product, so I venture that your guidance will help many.<p>Thanks in advance,<p>Igor.\nhttp://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com",1242391868

I was pretty much a regular person from a middle class family who went to public school and aspired to be the first in my family to graduate college.  Here's the problem with being born ""too soon"":<p>I graduated high school, college, and graduate school <i>without ever having touched a computer</i>.  Think about that.  Neither of my colleges even had a Comp Sci department.  I grew up in Western Pennsylvania, far from the leading edges of Boston and California.  Nobody, I mean <i>nobody</i> knew anything about computers.  They were giant machines that sent your electric bill.  Period.  Unless you were fortunate to be close to the geek counter culture of Northern California or had parents with millions of dollars, forget it.<p>I graduated with an MBA and got a job as a restaurant manager (1978 was a lot like 2009).  Then I picked up a COBOL book and practically memorized it for a difficult to get programming interview.  I got the job and the rest is history.<p>I often wonder what my life would have been like if I had been born 10 or 20 years later.  But it's a wasted thought.  What if I had been born 10 or 20 years earlier.  I'd probably be a retired car dealer now.<p>The great thing is that now it just doesn't matter.  I took a while to get here, but I can't imagine doing anything else.  Maybe that's why I'm here so often: making up for lost time.",1242391786

Null does not work in real-world and a computer that says ""I don't know"" is not a useful computer.<p>I'm definitely in the minority here but personally I think databases would be a lot easier if Null=empty string/0/0D/False or any init value set for a field. I've been coding for 15 years now and have not once used Null in a positive, useful way. The only time I care about Nulls is in WHERE (field='' OR field IS NULL). I would rather it treat nulls like empty strings etc. because then I only have to check for field=''. Nulls in every real-world app I've used mean the same as empty string/false etc.<p>Customer name isn't entered in the system yet? That's not allowed so system will not create the record. Has customer been set as type 'Active'? We don't know? Then they're not active. Do they have multiple shipping addresses? 0 rows in the customer-ship table? That means no, they don't have multiple shipping addresses as of right now. The worst is having a null in a boolean field. That's not boolean, that's a ternary! I either want a TRUE or a FALSE in a boolean field. Null doesn't make sense. Is employee salaried or not? Null is not allowed in that field. The user-interface will not accept a blank or null. It will be a radio button 'Yes' or 'No'. There is no way a Null can be set for that field.<p>I can totally understand nulls in C/C++ with pointers etc. That makes complete sense and I'd be a fool to argue against the need for nulls there. But for databases where a field value is missing, it's just extra work instead of any benefits. I don't see why I'd ever need a Null. It's not like I'm using weird hacks to do whatever null is supposed to do. I'm just saying all I ever get from null is extra code on my end yet I get no benefits of detecting that something is null.",1242389590

So I kept looking for ways to fix it: stay away from the internet, track time working vs resting in minutes (like 50min work/10min rest), etc.<p>It ends up it wasn't that much my fault. I worked on a pretty crowded office with lots of noise and where people would interrupt you multiple times. I'd get multiple emails in a day (multiple like 15, I've worked in places where you get 100s), and we'd have numerous meetings which weren't important.<p>It all changed when I changed jobs. I've been working from home now: its all silent, I dont get any emails, only work 7 hours/day, and no meetings except the morning scrum, which hardly takes 5 minutes.<p>When I spend time on the internet it hardly takes more than 10 minutes. I never have any issues going back to work, and get a lot done each day.<p>So instead of focusing on self discipline, turning of internet, etc, I'd say focus on your working environment and project. That was the game changer for me, not internet, not self discipline, not 'get it done already'.",1242388966

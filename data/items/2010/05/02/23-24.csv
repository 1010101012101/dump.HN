It can be a very rewarding experience.<p>From my time spent in the space I've found that few of the small to medium NPO's (which we call not-for-profits or NFP's in Australia)I've found that there is a heavy cost in terms of education to demonstrate the benefits of social media activities. Many times the benefits are medium to long term whereas these organisations need solutions which work a little faster than that in order to justify the expense to their boards.<p>It may be an obvious thing to say but I would be focusing on presenting solutions with a clear ROI  for both yourselves and the non-profit.<p>After we shut up our startup I've since gone into the for-profit online marketing space. The returns are a lot greater and there are a lot more companies willing to spend money to test new ideas. I hope to come back to the non-profit space one day, but probably not until I've got some clout to make real change (ie networks or capital).",1272844285

I am almost certain it will be true.  But it's also meaningless, because <i>everyone</i> could predict that, and there's really not much you can do with that prediction.<p>The same with many of the predictions that you mention.  It's a fairly good bet that in 10 years, people will use computers to communicate.  But that's a useless prediction - so what?  Maybe it's useful fodder for cocktail-party conversation, but maybe not even then - there's really not much meat to discuss in that.<p>In fact, Kurzweil was wrong about even one of his ""safe"" predictions.  He predicted that the stock market would be higher in 2009 than in 2001, something that's been true of every decade since the 1930s.  It wasn't.<p>The details matter.  There's an amazing human trend toward confirmation bias - when people find that one of their predictions hasn't panned out, they try and broaden it out, ignore a few details, and fit the data to their predictions.  But if you want your data to have any validity at all, <i>you can't do this</i>.  Your predictions need to be specific enough in both details and timeframe that you can unequivocally state whether or not they're true, in their original form.  And if they aren't, well, they're false.<p>(And I suspect your overall point, that VCs don't care about these predictions, is something I'd totally agree with.  But we have a different idea of what a prediction is.  I don't think pundit wankery that speaks in vague generalities about the future counts as a prediction at all.

That means that if the inflation rate is negative, people can effectively earn interest simply by sitting on their cash, since it'll be worth more in the future.  If people earn interest by doing nothing, what incentive do they have to invest in a potentially risky venture that may make more in the long run, but may also cost them their principal?<p>Deflation biases people towards inaction, because they know that sitting and waiting means their money will be worth more in the future.  Inflation biases people towards action - they know their money will be worth less in the future, so they may as well invest in <i>something</i>.  The Austrian critiques of monetary inflation are basically right - it <i>does</i> result in bubbles, as people seek higher returns from progressively more risky investments because they know their cash will be worth less.<p>Technically, the mainstream economist view shoots for price stability (0% inflation) and not inflation.  But they recognize that they'll never achieve that, so they err on the side of inflation.  Mostly, this is because inflation is easier to cure than deflation is.  If everybody is biased toward inaction, then when the Fed pumps money into the system to stimulate action, it tends to collect within firms who won't spend it because they expect it'll be worth more in the future.  (This is currently a very real problem, as much of the money the Fed injected in 2009 is collecting in banks that are trying to shore up their balance sheets and consumers that are trying to pay down debt.)  Each firm always has the option of choosing not to spend the money it's received.  All it takes is one firm that wants to hoard, and the money will never circulate within the economy.<p>If you have continuous low-level inflation, however, it can be brought under control simply by reducing the money supply.  You can't spend money that you don't have.  (Well, you can on a micro-level by borrowing from another firm, but you can't on a macro-level because there's nobody else to borrow from.)  So when the Fed restricts the money supply, that reduction filters all the way through the economy, people have less money to spend, and prices drop.",1272842516

1313424,comment,1312242,1312242,0,0,pge,,,"I disagree with this approach for angels. I'll approach it from two angles, an investor willing to think through and modify terms, and an investor that wants a boilerplate set of terms for every deal.  In the first case, it's important to think through the shape of the entire return curve.  If a company is 100% common stock with no liquidation preference, and you own 20%, your return is linear, $0.20 for every dollar of sale value.  As soon as you add preferences, participation, caps, etc, that line is no longer straight.  A 2x preference, for example, strongly weights the low value exits (the curve is steeper from O to the 2x amount, then reduces in slope).  In the negotiation between the investor and the management team, each side has views of what the ultimate value may be (or what a probability weighted view of potential exits might be), and each side can manipulate the shape of that curve to match his expectations.  For example, if the investor is worried about a low priced exit, and the management thinks the company is worth a lot more, a 2x liquidation preference and a higher valuation works for both parties.  Investors get more of the exit value at a low price, and management gets more on the upside (because of the higher valuation results in more percentage ownership for them).  If both sides understand how these terms work, creative use of preferences, participation, and caps can help everyone get to a deal that works.\nIf, however, one wants a standard set of terms for every deal, I would recommend sticking with straight up 1x non-participating preferred and reducing the number of variables to one: valuation.  2x is usually perceived as not founder friendly and raises unnecessary concerns (whether real or perceived).  It also sets a bad precedent for subsequent institutional investors, who will likely ask for 2x as well in order to be on the same ground. If the institutional financing is substantially larger than the angel round (as is usually the case), the angels end up losing by the precedent they set.  With the institutional financing in place, the return for the angels is (almost always) better when both institutional and angel investors have 1x, than if both have 2x.  Whether or not it is justified, institutional investors are often going to seek ""fairness"" by having terms on par with (or better) than angels.  Setting a precedent with 2x for the angels will lead them to go for 2x as well, which doesnt help the founders and doesn't help the angels.",1272841472

33435,comment,33246,33246,0,0,uuilly,,,"I totally understand people's complaints about C++.  However I am never sure if they are aware of some libraries that may  concerns:<p>boost::function allows you to easily interchange function pointers, memeber function pointers and function objects.<p>boost::lamda allows you to define transient functions at the call site.  This makes the old STL way more useful.  To be sure the syntax can be a bit funky...<p>boost::bind pulls all the fun of boost::lamda and boost::function together.<p>With only the tiniest bit of discipline boost::shared_ptr's mean you never have to worry about memory management again.  <p>boost::any and QVariants (from the Qt Libraries) help you manage dynamic typing.  So an array of boost::any's can hold int's, char's, string's and AnyTypeYouWant's all at the same time.  <p>Everything I've mentioned is either in the standard or will be soon.  Really undergrad C++ is only the beginning.  The STL and boost are almost a language unto themseleves.  I never use raw arrays or naked pointers anymore and it's made development WAY faster while maintaining performance.<p>PG asked, why use a language where adaptors have to be built to get the functionality of lisp rather than lisp itself (or something like that.)  I see his point but if the effort of getting lisp to work with C/C++ based code is greater than the pain of using an LFM, why not make the best of an LFM?<p>Has anyone had the same experience?  Or am I putting the ""ass"" in masses?<p>",1184051721

I certainly appreciate all the extra real estate, and yet I can't deny that I could find a use for more.  I'm considering plugging my old CRT into my integrated video card, but it produces so much heat compared to a flat panel.",1184051593

If they get providers to lower costs, then insurance premiums will decrease across the board, both for that company and their competitors. They can negotiate small discounts in their own individual favor, but large measures that truly cut <i>costs</i> and not just <i>prices</i> will impact everyone. As such, there's no real reason for insurance companies to negotiate for lower <i>costs</i>, since competition will ensure that their premiums decrease by a similar amount and they don't make any more money. Since demand for health care is pretty inelastic, they won't gain substantially more custom by lowering prices, thus they have no reason to try to substantially cut costs..",1330869564

People with low deductible insurance don't comparison shop because they have no incentive to do so. I have no insurance (my startup is minimally funded), and I do comparison shop.<p><i>It's a bit like having no idea how a car works or what could be wrong with it, and then being asked to pick the best mechanic and strategy to fix it.</i><p>Here is what I did a few weeks back. I went to a doctor who ordered an MRI. I called around, discovered the price of MRI's varied from 5-7k (INR, not USD), and then picked the closest one to my home (the price difference was small enough that I didn't care).<p>When it came time to get treatment, I did research on the internet, as well as asking three separate doctors. They all independently had the same recommendation - microlumbar discectomy on L5-S1. This was fairly apparent based also on the pattern of pain I was suffering, and just by looking at the MRI. I ruled out one hospital because it seemed dirty, chose a doctor/hospital to have it done (not the cheapest, but not the priciest), downgraded from a deluxe room to a private one [1], and got myself fixed up.<p>This doesn't work for emergency medicine, but most medicine is not emergencies.<p>[1] The default over here is to give white guys the gold-plated options.",1330866425

It was the culmination of the semester, and considering how hard many of the students were working, there was frustration that this was all they could make after a semester. I think that your plan will not go well, and could quite possibly sour your students on programming for life.

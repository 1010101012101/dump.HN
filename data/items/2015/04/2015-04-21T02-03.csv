They had to stay in the slightly crappy &quot;black&quot; block of the motel. The irony is that all the cars parked in front of the shitty &quot;black&quot; block of the motel were expensive ones. Also they&#x27;re not even black, they&#x27;re Asian. Apparently every business in that part of the town had de-facto segregation like this.<p>I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s still like that. I&#x27;ve seen on recent TV documentaries (e.g. Louis Theroux) that there is still a hell of a lot of racism down there, so I imagine things haven&#x27;t changed very much for the better.",1429585195

9412010,comment,9409684,9409684,0,0,maceo,,,"As a life-long LA resident, I say don&#x27;t believe the hype. The article says that the centerpiece is the revitalization of the LA river. As far as I can tell, this isn&#x27;t happening. Some bike paths were added along the river, which is nice, but that&#x27;s far from what I&#x27;d call revitalization. The bike paths are still poorly lit, they still smell like shit, and they&#x27;re not getting much use. There&#x27;s a huge trainyard east of downtown (one of the coolest parts of the city, imo) called Piggyback Yard, which is owned by Union Pacific, who doesn&#x27;t want to sell the land. It&#x27;d be hard for the city to do any significant revitalization of the river without turning the Piggyback Yard into a park that can provide flood control. Furthermore, the US Army corps of engineers controls the LA river, so the voters have no say in what happens here.<p>The metro extensions have been planned for decades, and there never seems to be much movement. Recently the blue line has been creeping steadily towards Santa Monica but I doubt this will have much of an impact on city life even if it does connect downtown LA to the westside beach communities. I used to encourage everyone to try taking the train, and I used to do it myself all the time, but I haven&#x27;t hopped on the train at all in the last 12 months. The stations are too spread out, the paths of all the lines make little sense, the trains only come every 15-20 minutes, and a huge chunk of the city is totally cut off from the transit lines. As much as I don&#x27;t like uber/lyft, they&#x27;ve made it much more enjoyable to live in LA.<p>Ciclavia is cool, but its just 1 day out of the year. LA is the worst city in the country to ride a bike. They claim to have more bike lines than any other city, but that&#x27;s only on paper. Just because you paint a person riding a bike next to the gutter of a 2 lane street doesn&#x27;t make it a bike lane. Yet that is exactly what the city has done in the name of adding bike friendly streets.<p>All of these projects are little more than photo-ops for city politicians.",1429584398

Most recent example of the condition for me: I had a bag of old wine bottle corks gathered maybe 15 years ago, boxed away. I needed a stopper and one of those corks fitted the bill perfectly. Perhaps that&#x27;s just reinforcing unhealthy behaviours??<p>In part for me it&#x27;s about waste - it pains me to throw away plastic (for example) knowing that it came from a finite resource and had so many different inputs. There&#x27;s so little effort made to recycle - I swear that within a century or two we&#x27;re going to be mining old landfill sites.<p>People throw out TVs when the power button fails, throw out whole computer base-stations (aka towers) when a HDD fails, scrap cars that just need new piston rings ... as a society we seem particularly bad at addressing these things; corporations move ever more to accelerate [the appearance of] obsolescence. To encourage the throw-away society.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s not a structure that can be used to gather in and warehouse, for example electronics, and make them available without cost - maybe using something like prisoner labour. It definitely doesn&#x27;t seem to be immediately financially sustainable to (for example) gather in all the working components from household goods. A second-hand washing machine controller might cost £100 for an old machine, commercially; when in reality it&#x27;s just saved from someone&#x27;s scrap. Given a new machine can be had for £200, it&#x27;s not financially valid. But that scrapped controller can give 12 months more service to a complete machine - how can we engineer in a greater value to repair and recycling than the immediate financial saving/cost? Should we?",1429583612

He mourns his family and the loss of his research lab as he believes he is dying. He himself explains at length the curious and terrifying situation.<p>Further, there was nothing to prepare him for this. Heroin, largely demonized by society and a quite potent drug has a &quot;standard&quot; dose of about .1g or 100mg. Obviously, a dose differs based on habit and potency, however this is certainly enough to feel the effects. Hofman consumed 1/4 of a mg. A dose 400x smaller than that which was just described. With little known about hallucinogens (certainly native Americans and Amazonians had discovered psychoactive plants) at least to Hofman, this feelig was wholly original. It would be entirely possible, probably plausible given his disposition, that he was lethally poisoned.<p>Hofman, did say that as he descended down the bell curve after the peak that it was an enjoyable experience. He even remarked that psychologists would line to study it. However, given how intense and terrifying he deacribed the initial onset, I would not fault him, not call him cowardly, for not wanting to resume self-experimentation. This likely would have lead to LSD-25 not being put into widespread circulation, possibly forever.<p>To your point of the self-perpetuating bad trip. I concede that it is entirely possible that the meme of a bad trip and the medias portrayal of the drug could certainly induce one to have a bad trip. However, the knowledge of how the drug interacts with the body and the now well-known pharmacology can be leveraged for confort when one is under the influence. The knowledge that one is safe and it is only a temporary state brought about by a drug. Hofman did not have this. He could not take comfort in knowing approcimately when the effects would subside, or even of they ever would. i don&#x27;t think comparing a trip where a person jas knowledge of the drug academically, but never practically (a contemporary persons first trip) can be legitimately compared to the first ever trip.<p>It goes to show how amazing and extraordinary the feelings and perception must have been when Hofman became comfortable. After the fear and heavy effects wore off, he must have truly marveled at the changed perspective, and been willing to try amd acheive it again for its benefits accross a host of disciplines and use cases",1429583556

We also usually find &quot;cowboy coder&quot; in a negative context, but a search now for &quot;cowgirl coder&quot; finds more positive contexts. Eg, &quot;My name is Tarah Wheeler Van Vlack, and I blog about Linux, coding, current technology, and women’s issues in the IT workplace right here at The Cowgirl Coder.&quot; and &quot;I was one happy cowgirl coder, so I just kept going—learning as much as I could about design, development, and tech in general.&quot;<p>(The general neutral term seems to be &quot;cow hand&quot; or &quot;cattle handler&quot;.)<p>The term &quot;best boy&quot; appears to be used for both men and women, with no difference in their roles. This would be a non-sexist, or at least minimally sexist, use of the term.<p>The term &quot;bus boy&quot; appears to be disappearing, in place of busser. This is part of the general trend towards gender-neutral job titles, but part of me thinks it&#x27;s also part of a longer trend of egalitarianism. That is, &quot;boy&quot; when directed towards an adult can indicate superior status. Hence why &quot;garçon&quot; - French for &quot;boy&quot; - should not be confused with the polite way to get the attention of a server in a French restaurant. As a more direct example, traditionally &quot;boy&quot; was also used by many white people to refer to any black male, no matter the age, specifically because blacks had inferior status than whites.<p>(And then there&#x27;s &quot;cabana boy&quot;, which can be used in contexts where &quot;young male&quot; is an essential aspect of the job, in the same eye candy way that &quot;young woman&quot; was an aspect of being a cigarette girl.)<p>You could pick out how &quot;boy&quot; is used in &quot;best boy&quot; to argue that it isn&#x27;t a sexist term. But that argument would be incomplete because the issue isn&#x27;t about any single title but the default-is-male implication in many titles.<p>I believe that your argument with &quot;fisherman&quot; is similar. If I ask &quot;how many businessmen wear dresses?&quot;, I suspect that most would be be confused, and think I am asking about male transvestites, and only secondarily consider that many businesspeople are businesswomen who wear dresses.<p>I can ask the same question using other gendered topics. How many firemen have given birth? Of the policemen with heavy periods, do most prefer pads or tampons? I think more people would have a double-take with these -man/-men titles compared to the general-neutral forms of &quot;firefighters&quot; and &quot;police officers&quot;. If I&#x27;m correct, that would suggest that -man in those titles comes with an assumption that they will be held by males, which makes them more sexist than the gender-neutral forms.",1429582857

Not sure if that&#x27;s really something I&#x27;ll miss when it&#x27;s gone, but it&#x27;s definitely a big change with Netflix that ultimately started as a smaller disruption with DVR devices...<p>I suppose personally my feelings on the matter is even though I might lose the few advantages that you mentioned, the disadvantages far outweigh it and I won&#x27;t miss the airing of shows like Breaking Bad or Suits that took one season and split them in half with gigantic gaps in between (months or even years), to the point where you can&#x27;t even remember where the show was going by the time it returns. I like the freedom to watch at whatever schedule I prefer, without any kind of arbitrary limitations that may or may not suit my lifestyle at the time, and the confidence to know I&#x27;m going to be able to see a story through from start to finish once devote time to it...",1429582094

The &quot;rule of thumb&quot; for AlexNet-derived networks (with conv layers followed by fully connected layers) is that 95% of the computation time is spent in the conv layers, but 95% of the parameters are stored as the weights of the FC layers. I imagine the later stage could be memory-bound and the former stage is CPU-bound.<p>Not sure if this holds true for other NN structures like GoogLeNet or the weirder recent fully convolutional networks.",1429582066

The operation itself is highly parallelizable and typically compute-bound (as opposed to memory-bound). As a result, advances in GPU performance will translate into improvements in GEMM. However, it also means that algorithmically you&#x27;re limited by the hardware. GEMM is an _extremely_ mature so algorithmic improvements are unlikely. Instead, any algorithmic improvements would likely stem from replacing GEMM with a more tailored, specialized operation.",1429581888

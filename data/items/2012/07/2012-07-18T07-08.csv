To work at all, it would probably have to be run over Tor, but setting up Tor properly to avoid leaving fingerprints is a task for advanced internet users, while in this situation being less tech-savvy could be deadly.<p>Second, this system also could be used for deception. If an innocent citizen can report events and locations, why wouldn't the cartel use it to fool authorities?<p>Third, it looks like an offer to throw even more money into the 'war on drugs' sinkhole, only disguised as 'fighting with technology', 'technological workaround to the fear', and other BS propaganda.",1342598267

It's just not what I would expect if I would sign up for a ML class. Note, however, that I'm not complaining about the <i>contents</i> of the ML class, which I think were awesome, a really nice broad overview of the ML techniques. I really think I learned a lot. I'm just complaining about the homeworks, nothing else. They were not ML homeworks, they were CS homeworks (particularly, Matlab class homeworks). I don't know the contents of the real Stanford class, but believing your description, the same kind complaint applies.<p>You're wrong when you say that ""lazy solutions"" don't perform well in the real world. In the real world, robots aren't programmed in Matlab (I hope). In compiled languages, loops are just as fast as vectorized code (which is implemented using loops). Vectorized code having better performance than imperative looping code is just an artifact of the fact that Matlab (and e.g. R) are interpreted languages. (Sure, there might be some additional optimizations possible on vectorized code, like SIMD instructions, cache locality, special algorithms for sparse vectors/matrices, but this is in most situations premature optimization. Being able to write correct code and read it later beats 2% gain in performance!)",1342597757

As far as I can tell, they were able to run game instances for two different versions side by side until all of the players of the old version have left. The world of one version would slowly drain of players while the world of the next version filled with them.<p>As someone also working on an online game, Guild Wars was a real inspiration for large amounts of our architecture.<p>While we currently don't have the ability to run the game with a subset of data (though our code base was designed with that in mind for later) it's not far off, and the way our game client can patch itself in to the full game using only it's executable was something that was entirely inspired from Guild Wars.<p>The main problem I see is that I think our base data set would need to be something along the lines of 500 meg before you can play rather than the very small amount GW had as mandatory to get to the menu. This is mainly due to the ability to encounter other players who might decide to use skills or items and we would prefer that they were available rather than having those players in a state where the game looks wrong.<p>Also, while we do have fast patch deployment (about 30 seconds to change between game versions) we don't quite yet have the ability to do it as well as GW did with completely restartless updates.

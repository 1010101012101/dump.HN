2464207,comment,2462224,2462224,3,0,scott_s,,,"I took a similar approach when I taught programming to non-CS majors last summer. The difficulty is that it required significant one-on-one time with each student that needed help, and it required that they came to me. Luckily, my students weren't shy and I made myself readably available to them almost every day. But college students are generally better motivated to seek out help than high school, middle school and elementary students.<p>What took so long with each student was, based on their original question, systematically figuring out what their <i>real</i> misunderstanding was. This could be very time consuming, and took enormous patience on my part. It required much back and forth with the student so I could build a mental model of <i>their</i> mental model. Then I had to figure out how to build a bridge from their mental model to the correct one. That also was time consuming, because I sometimes had to build several bridges before finding one that clicked with the student.<p>Usually helping the Nth student on a project was quicker than helping the first because by that time I recognized what were common problems and built a bag of tricks to explain them. For example, it took me a surprisingly long time to realize the students had no practice running through an algorithm on paper, then translating that to code. (This was partially because the algorithm was so simple I hadn't even realized it was an algorithm.) So one technique I used was to, on paper, set up what was needed for the algorithm to work (list of numbers, table of results, etc.), then make them tell me what to do to get the correct result. I was acting as, basically, an intelligent computer that could be programmed in English. After doing this a few times, the students could finally ""see"" the algorithm, but it took a lot of time and effort with each student.",1303246793

2464203,comment,2464023,2464023,1,0,DanielKehoe,,,"I used Trada on a partner's project for several months in summer 2010 (for a self-help product sold online). Since then Trada have improved their platform but I haven't tried it again. Our budget was $3000/month (the minimum required to establish a Trada campaign). We'd had a successful PPC campaign before using Trada and were hoping to improve sales volume and efficiencies. After six weeks, we halted the Trada campaign because we were burning through our budget. Our unit sales increased 1.5x but our costs increased 2.5x. We found that the Trada ""optimizers"" were incentivized to maximize traffic but not cost-per-action. Our Trada rep told us that if we stuck with it, our CPA would improve and incentives would shift to a CPA-based reward system. But we were losing so much money on each sale with the increased PPC expense we had to halt the campaign. Trada is legit and we were treated well by our rep and the optimizers. I learned some things about how to improve a PPC campaign. But the operation that was in place when they launched last year was not optimal for our small ""mom and pop"" ecommerce business. It was better suited for a large online agency or consumer brand business that could spend $10,000 and recover the upfront learning costs in improved sales over six or more months. Again, they have changed their platform in the last few months so maybe it works better now for businesses like mine. But expect to drop a lot of coin before seeing results.",1303246700

2464112,comment,2463305,2463305,4,0,EGreg,,,"There is a reason why facebook used PHP, wordpress is in PHP, and a lot of other tools are also. PHP is popular, it's easy to find developers who will write it in it, and it's also easy to find PHP hosting for noobs. When there is a popular platform, you will get lots of apps written on it.<p>That said, the high art of PHP was always to make really performant apps while having your code as organized as possible. These days, this is being done very well with files, autoloading, and opcode caching. If you do things this way, Rasmus would be happy, and things would be fast.<p>I am a PHP developer. A lot of what I saw in the past few years was frameworks like Cake and symfony that basically copied Rails or brought some heavy techniques with a lot of overhead. This is not the PHP way. If you want to see a framework that does things in a more PHP way, I would humbly submit my own:<p><a href=""http://phponpie.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phponpie.com</a><p>It's open source. It's called PHP On Pie for a reason: because it's easy and it uses real PHP techniques, not tries to emulate Ruby or Python. PHP has its own beauty, such as arrays which can support numeric and string indexes at the same time.<p>All this said, these days PHP is outdated for large sites. Not because there is a lot of crap written in it -- which I agree with. But because it still works only synchronously, and the culture is too server-heavy. Large sites should be written like this:<p><pre><code>  Clients (browser, etc.) do most of the interface logic.

  Components should render themselves using javascript, and only use the server for data

  Server does web services (REST, socket push, etc.)

  Server should not have to do things synchronously.
</code></pre>
Node.js rocks in this respect. Unlike PHP, I can literally issue 10 independent queries to 10 different databases and combine the results as they come in. In PHP, I would have to issue this stuff sequentially. That's slow.<p>The second thing in PHP is fixable. People should move most of the logic (that doesn't need authentication) to the client side, and then write all their web services in a very simple way. Stop generating all your HTML on the server.

2464003,comment,2463305,2463813,0,0,6ren,,,"Sounds like disruption: lower quality on the metrics that mainstream programmers care about; and targeting non-consumption (i.e. making programming accessible to people who wouldn't otherwise be able to).<p>People who don't have access to anything are delighted to have <i>something</i>. Therefore, PHP gets a foothold even though it's lower quality. This is the beginning of disruption.<p>The next part of disruption is improvement. And PHP is improving. At the same time, other programming systems are improving - C#, python, ruby, objective-C even Java has improved (generics etc). So it might seem that PHP will never catch up - which is probably true. But the crucial disruptive insight is that it mightn't need to: programmers might not all need all the extra improvements in mainstream languages, for all tasks. One piece of evidence is that PHP itself is already good enough for some tasks. For any advanced functionality, it's often possible to think of use-cases that <i>wouldn't</i> benefit from it. This means that it's possible for mainstream languages to ""overshoot"" what most programmers require for most tasks (to ""overserve"" them, like serving more food to someone who's already full). But, you might say, mainstream users are increasing in their ability to use advanced functionality as they learn more, so they <i>can</i> use the extra functionality (the patrons' stomachs are getting bigger). The interesting possibility is that the rate of improvement of mainstream languages may be faster than the rate of increase in the ability of programmers to use it (the servings getting bigger faster than the patron's stomachs are) - disruptive research has found that this is usually the case. It's because companies developing competitive products work really hard at improving them (to remain competitive); but consumers don't like to change their behaviour that fast.<p>The final stage of disruption is that programmers leave their mainstream language, and switch to PHP because although it's not as good, it's good enough for their task, and it has other benefits (not sure what they are for PHP, but for disruption it's usually: cheaper, more convenient, simpler - the latter two are true of PHP, but as it adds functionality, it would seem it must lose them. It will just copy mainstream languages).<p>But I can't imagine this happening, so therefore either disruption doesn't apply in this case (perhaps because a company isn't running PHP? Or because programmers themselves are unusually competitive and early-adopting, and even if some don't want to change their behaviour that quickly, there's another generation coming up real fast? Or as I said above, PHP can't retain its simplicity of being a template language while adding advanced features) - or my imagination is lacking.",1303243551

We follow a fairly traditional model with training, consulting, and support being primary offerrings. If you look under products and services at <a href=""http://10gen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://10gen.com</a> you will see pricing, etc.<p>In terms of best-practices, the first hurdle is to get your product used and demonstrating value. To do this you have to listen to your users and help them out to demonstrate that value (which is why the whole team is on our mailing list and IRC channel all the time). Generally when it comes to someone purchasing services from us, they have already tried out the product and may even have it in production. This is vastly different from a lot of closed source software where you end up in a long sales cycle just trying to convince customers to use it.<p>For databases, the training-consulting-support model works well. For other products, some other model may be more appropriate. We've also talked (both internally and externally) about closed-source addons/tools/features.

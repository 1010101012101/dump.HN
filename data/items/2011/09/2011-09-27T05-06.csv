3042046,comment,3039873,3040286,1,0,yason,,,"This is ringing true. It somehow illustrates how essential computational complexity is because you're totally fucked up if you have no clue--yet how rarely you actually bump into the question of complexity in real life.<p>I'm self-taught and I've read and learned about computational complexity several times from various CS books and later Internet since I was maybe fifteen years old. I know how O(1), O(lg n), O(n lg n), O(n), O(n^x), and O(x^n) scale and which kind of algorithms roughly belong to which order of complexity.<p>However, keyword being <i>several times</i>.<p>I so rarely bump into these that I don't <i>actively</i> remember if heapsort is lg n or n lg n, or how the best-case, average-case, and worst-case complexities differ <i>exactly</i> between heapsort, quicksort, and mergesort. (I do remember that mergesort had a good worst-case behaviour in comparison to the others, at least quicksort, but I'd really have to check the bounds separately.) To mitigate this, I've guiltily re-learned them several times--I <i>like</i> reading Knuth or other CS books per se, just for fun--but like anything you don't need you do have a hard time remembering.<p>However, I do recognize them all being lg-something and looking up the various bounds is just a Google search away. Further, I do recognize the complexity orders in the sense that I might prototype something and initially stash items into a linked list but make a mental note that accessing the list can potentially become a bottleneck because it's O(n) so I shall reserve some mind power to change it into some O(lg) tree or ordered array at some point.<p>But at the other end the truth is that you just have to have some idea about complexity. You generally don't need more than that, and when you do you can just re-study that portion of the subject in detail from a huge number of web pages.<p>For example, it's useful to recognize the obvious bottlenecks of O(n^x) and O(x^n) but if you do, you don't bump into them anymore. You might bump into O(n) bottlenecks because you left them there yourself, probably on purpose, but since you recognize what linear complexity can do you will generally just change the relevant data structures into O(lg something) and be done with it. And if O(lg something) code becomes a bottleneck, you usually have stupid access patterns elsewhere in the code; I don't remember ever seeing a binary tree alone having become the real bottleneck in any program with the rest of the code being optimal.<p>What's interesting is that I more often bump into problems with the physical representation of the data structure than the computational complexity. A big naive hash table can cause lots of cache misses unless you deliberately work to align your items withing as few cachelines as possible. The difference between accessing five cachelines rather than five hundred cachelines can be blasting. I know this kind of optimization wouldn't scale towards n⇒∞ generally but it can have a big\neffect on real-world programs.",1317102518

3041970,story,,,10,6,skcin7,"Ever get a weird/sentamental feeling when getting rid of old computers?",,"A few months ago, I bought my first Apple computer, which is a MacBook Pro, and it is awesome. It cost about $2000, which is a lot for me, and I figured I'd offset some of the costs by selling my previous computer, which is an old Dell laptop that I had for about 2 years (I was way overdue for an upgrade). However, when it came time to selling it, I decided against it. It was the first computer I used to install Apache on. I learned PHP, CSS, HTML, JavaScript on it. Not to mention all the SERIOUS web browsing. The keys on the home row have considerably more wear than the rest of the keys, which is evidence of how much I've had my fingers on the keyboard. I figure that the memories I have on this machine are worth more than the $200 or so I would get from selling it. As a result, I chose not to sell it, and now it sits in my closet. Anybody else have similar sentimental bonds to their previous computers?<p>I recall my very first computer - it was an old Packard Bell machine with a top of the line Pentium processor, and it had Windows 95 on it, and although I was very young and did not do much tech related stuff on it, I still used the hell out of it. Lots of educational games that my parents bought me, and lots of playing Sierra's ""3D Ultra Pinball"" and ""The Incredible Toon Machine"". Haha. I also remember my second computer which I used in a similar way which was a Pentium II and had Windows 98 on it. I used the HELL out of these machines.<p>When I was in high school, I thought it would be fun to take these 2 computers apart and destroy them in the process. I recall opening the hard drives with a screwdriver and throwing all the parts all over the yard. When I was done I threw them in the trash. Boy what a fucktard I was. Now that I just graduated college, I wish I had these machines :-/ I kept this regret in mind when making my decision NOT to sell my old laptop. :-)",1317099864

3041966,comment,3041749,3041749,15,0,bcantrill,,,"In my experience, the only people who weigh in on these debates are those who do not live in Silicon Valley -- like any epicenter for anything, those of us who have made our careers here hardly give a damn how the rest of the world compares themselves to us.  (Or to put this another way:  New Yorkers do not sit around debating if or that New York is the world's epicenter for finance.)  But as someone who has grown slightly sick of the pro-NYC mania, I feel obliged to enter the fray -- if only because Silicon Valley is being misunderstood at an essential level.<p>While I agree that New York has displaced Boston, it is no threat to Silicon Valley's crown:  New York does adequately at some variants of software service startups (e.g., the Foursquares of the world), but it is missing virtually every other element of the ecosystem.  There is no microprocessor company in NYC. There is no network equipment provider in NYC.  There is no computer company in NYC.  There is no handset maker in NYC.  There is no cloud company in NYC. Yes, Google may have a large presence in NYC, but Intel has a large presence in Portland; a single company's large presence cannot in and of itself create an ecosystem.  And that ecosystem is the difference between having a ""vibrant tech scene"" and being the world's epicenter for technological innovation; NYC may be the former, but is unlikely to ever displace Silicon Valley as the latter.",1317099744

It had been working completely fine for me for months. Then suddenly last week it&#x27;s become so slow it&#x27;s almost unusable. Specifically, when ever I click in the address bar or in any web-form field, or when ever I close an open tab, I get the spinning beach ball for 5-15 seconds. I&#x27;m running the current version of Chrome and Mac OS X. I&#x27;m on a modern MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. I&#x27;m on a highspeed cable connection. This happens with all extensions disabled and no other applications running. I&#x27;ve uninstalled and reinstalled, with no improvements. Firefox and Safari both work fine, and I&#x27;ve switched to FF for most of my daily work. I&#x27;ve asked for help on Google Groups. Several others seem to be experiencing the same problems, but no one has any solutions. I&#x27;m hoping someone here on HN has some ideas. Anyone?",1374926300

It also brings some sense of uniformity across apps for more complex controls.<p>For anything beyond that you are better off with yui/pure or csswizardry/inuit which offer much better responsive grid systems. Pure has one shortcoming in that you can&#x27;t specify varying column widths for varying devices (such as 6 columns for desktop and 3 for mobile). Both frameworks are light and offer some decent UI elements with minimal styling so you can extend them.",1374926300
6112602,comment,6112174,6112378,2,0,Dewie,,,"> Most people would not slaughter an animal without really having to do it,<p>Are you sure? The biggest problem I have with rod-fishing is that it is boring - not that the fish has to die (and I don&#x27;t give less value to the life of a fish than, say, a pig, as some people tend to do). Sure, I haven&#x27;t needed to slaughter my own livestock, but if I imagine that I have of only eaten oatmeal and potatoes for the last fourteen days, slaughtering some animal for its meat doesn&#x27;t seem like such a terrible sacrifice. Now, I am not a farmer or a hunter, but if I were you could just argue that most people are not farmers and/or hunters.<p>The modern man may be squeamish, but the thing about humans are that we are great at adapting. A modern urban person might recoil at the thought of not getting at least one shower a day, getting to sleep in a comfortable bed and have food in the fridge at all times, but if push comes to shove and she has to for some reason survive in the wilderness or out on a farm, I&#x27;d say she would get used to that reality relatively quickly. And she might have been previously reserved towards killing animals since the reality of it was so removed for her, but again if the need arose she would probably not have much problem with it unless she already had some established ethical opposition to using animals for their meat, hide etc. After all, a good chunk of her ancestors probably had to have a hand in slaughtering animals.",1374926244

Teenagers shoot each other up all the time (usually not directly in the school though, but the fights that lead to shooting often start there). Just last month in Chicago, a woman was shot in the chest while holding a child because a gun fight broke out on an alley by an elementary school.[2] Posting police might not be the best response, but its not baffling. Who the hell would want to teach at some south side Chicago schools without an armed police officer nearby?<p>And when the suburbanites hear about kids accidentally getting shot in gang hits in parks,[3] they want police in their schools too, never mind that the dangers are far less there.<p>[1] Chicago is the deadliest major (1m+) city in the U.S., with ~18-20 murders per 100k people per year. But it pales in comparison to small/mid-sized U.S. cities like Wilmington, DE (38 per 100k), New Orleans (53 per 100k), or Flint (65 per 100k). In comparison, London is 1.4 per 100k, Berlin 1.0 per 100k, Toronto 1.7 per 100k, and Paris is a hell-hole at 4.4 per 100k. In the neighborhoods where getting shot is a real threat, the murder rate is far higher than the above numbers per capita.<p>The list of top 50 world cities by murder rate has U.S. cities like St. Louis hanging among company that is almost entirely cities in Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Iraq, and South Africa, or Honduras: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_murder_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_murder_rate</a>. Compounding the average rates is the highly segregated nature of violence in American cities. As an aside, this is apparently mostly just a list of battlefields for the drug war. Except Detroit and Mosul, which I think are not so much on major drug trade routes like say Baltimore, but rather are simply parts of failed states...<p>[2] Last year, 319 Chicago Public School students were shot, 24 fatally so: <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-06-26/news/ct-met-cps-student-violence-0625-20120626_1_cps-students-students-shot-safe-haven-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-06-26/news/ct-met-cp...</a>.<p>[3] <a href=""http://nation.time.com/2013/01/30/chicago-girl-who-performed-at-obamas-inauguration-killed-in-shooting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nation.time.com/2013/01/30/chicago-girl-who-performed...</a>.",1374925669

And stock bootstrap very much is - that&#x27;s one of the things I love so much about it.<p>With the flat design stuff, now I&#x27;ll have to think about it, look for different solutions like themes, or maybe just going for it and hoping it&#x27;s not a problem, and generally spend time <i>not</i> making our ebook conversions better.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> big a deal, and I&#x27;m still way better off than without bootstrap, but I do consider it somewhat of a regression.",1374925223

If the machine on which you enroll initially is pwned at that time, the attacker sees the seed.  It&#x27;s a little better with physical tokens (where you&#x27;d need to compromise the token itself, or do MITM at setup time and persistently after).  I believe most of the good iOS TOTP apps use the &quot;keybag&quot; correctly so the seeds don&#x27;t leave the device when backed up, but it&#x27;s not perfect.  An x509 cert would fundamentally not be any different, and PK-based MFA (which Duo, OneID, and I think some other companies do) isn&#x27;t that different -- it just requires the verifying application talk to the app directly vs. something you can do as a human.",1374925196

I was really happy to find out you could use it without their (fairly expensive) service; it&#x27;s essentially a drop-in replacement for the Google Authenticator app.  I&#x27;ve still been using both, though.<p>The thing I dislike most is when sites don&#x27;t allow you to link your <i>own</i> OATH credential (i.e. a hardware token); I don&#x27;t consider any of the cellphone apps or services to be as secure as the hardware token, and there are nice ways to use the hardware tokens for role accounts (locking the physical token in a safe, or leaving it in the custody of a third party without direct access to the account, like a CFO).  The ideal implementation of OATH/2FA for a site allows users to specify their own, get the QR code, <i>or</i> get a text code.<p>Coinbase, for instance, only shows the QR code; I can&#x27;t either use my own hardware token or back up the character string (which I feel I can do safely) to let me re-generate the token.

6112544,comment,6112174,6112404,5,0,tomjakubowski,,,"> One thousand years ago there were farms in Greenland. Just two hundred years ago there was Little Ace Age and river Thames would freeze every winter.<p>One fairly well-supported theory of the cause of the Little Ice Age is that reforestation that due to a decline in Eurasian and American human populations led to an uptake in CO2 absorption [1] [2]. This suggests that at least partially anthropogenic climate change is a phenomenon which existed even before the Industrial Revolution. In any case,<p>> Single vulcano explosion releases more CO2 than entire mankind in a decade.<p>No [3]. Moreover, volcanic eruptions tend to have an overall dimming effect due to their release of sulfur-containing compounds which form sulfuric acid aerosol. There have even been some radical/crackpot geoengineering proposals to release sulfur into the atmosphere to combat global warming [4].<p>1: <a href=""http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/EI157.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/EI157.1</a>

If animal slaughter is alright because it was okay a few hundred years ago then slavery, child marriage and hundred other nonsensical stuff should be alright as well.

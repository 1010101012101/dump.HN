With modern technology, it's possible to make our representative democracy truly representative.<p>During an election, you give your proxy to anybody who is willing to be a representative.  Each representative votes in Congress with a vote weighted by the number of proxies they received.  The top 500 or so representatives get to sit in Congress.   Those who didn't reach the threshold must pass their proxy on to another.<p>Nobody is no longer ""represented"" by somebody they didn't vote for.  You can be represented by somebody who much more closely matches your interest.   ""Districts"" will still be represented because many people will choose a local candidate, but everybody is free to choose someone who will represent them better if no local candidate does.<p>This won't eliminate political parties, but it will significantly weaken them as strong representatives will no longer be as dependent on the party machinery.",1352231765

Its hard to be optimistic about these two ideas because while the chess example is a good story, its not analogous for many reasons, ranging from disparity in available information to players to a difference of several magnitudes in saturation.

So 'theoretically', they've already done what is being suggested here.

It would just be about one person either getting really lucky or coming up with something that is genius in its own right.<p>--<p>If there are 'professionals' and then other 'professionals' whose strategy depends on information about how other 'professionals' trade (and there is), you end up with strategies at all valid points in the sample space of possible strategies and counter strategies. Theoretically, there should be no other possible strategies. Inevitably someone will come up with one though, and the 'sample space' will grow.

Marketing is a different beast.<p>You wrote you have the impression LibreOffice is ""doing better"". What does that mean? Have you observed what OpenOffice is doing? What is your metric? If you have not looked into both projects and if you have not tried both products you simply cannot say that. You are a victim of marketing, probably. ""Doing better"" is too broad to say. Even when you say ""i like LO more"" you can't say ""doing better"" in general, because both project are not really merge-able codewise and cannot be compared. You just can give your own impression, like when you say ""Windows"" is doing better than ""OS X"".<p>You also miss one important point before you choose for which organization you are working. The license. Apache licensed code can be used in commercial products. GPL licensed (as with LO) cannot be used without becoming Open Source itself. This is important, because OpenOffice is the one you would take when you are working on a product which needs to include for example spreadsheet features.<p>That all said, Open Source has different point of views, but for many of us unpaid developers it is not about marketing. It is about fun of coding. Exploring new things. Make big things happen. I even agree when you say: collaborating on code, releasing and getting users is cool to have. But: nobody needs marketing for that. I have worked on many open source projects without a ""marketing division"".<p>What you said about GNU: they do not have a no-modification copyright license.<p>However in this blog post I outlined that wrong marketing is doing harm to a project. Flames against projects is doing that too. Having media with an opinion when they should make up news in a mostly objective way is bad too.<p>Still i don't get why there is dicussion. A group of people want to do project A, a group of people want to do project B. Nobody is forced to stick with a project. Everybody can switch project like he wants. I don't get why people are so emotional with these two projects. Again: calm down, let people have their fun.",1352231245

See next point.<p>3) Every ballot box records votes to a flash card that is physically taken to the nearest court house, where a judge is responsible for the equipment that can decrypt, compile and transfer results to the federal system, using a private network. At no point a ballot box is connected to any network or external devices.<p>4) The equipment is programmed to only function during official voting times, and only after running a test suite and integrity verification<p>5) At the end of the day each ballot box prints it own vote report, archived locally, and keeps a copy of the results in it's internal flash memory<p>If you remove 10k votes from one machine, the numbers won't match: every voter is registered, and you have to sign a small declaration if you don't vote - the number of voters is always known beforehand.

If an investigation finds that no such manipulation seems to have occurred, then no harm is done.<p>Unfortunately current US elections are unauditable because voting machines DO NOT produce any kind of verifiable voting trail.  Furthermore the apparent conclusion of the US media is that past discrepancies are evidence that their exit polling is flawed rather than that the voting process is being manipulated.  (They are biased to decide that way because accusing the winners of manipulating the vote - even if it is true - pushes them away from the appearance of neutrality that they try to keep.)<p>Furthermore you can't do exit polling on mail-in ballots.  So this potential signal of flawed elections is being lost at the same time that manipulation of elections is becoming even easier.<p>Personally if polls are overwhelming, and elections are in line with polls, I believe the result.  But I believe that there are lots of people trying to slip a thumb on the scales, so if polls are close, I am dubious about the results.  I personally believe that current evidence is that the Republicans are more successful in getting their thumbs on the scales, so I'm doubly suspicious when Republicans mysteriously do better than polls indicate they should.<p>I want us to have elections that I trust.

Coming up with something that works in backtesting is easy, doing it moving forward while staying within your risk envelope and considering all the associated costs is hard.<p>2) Closely related to #1. Whatever you put together is surely going to need plenty adaptation and oversight. It's a very fluid problem, you're just one player among countless others. How much time do you have in the day? Where is your capital coming from? For most people, the source of capital is a job that they probably can't ignore while fiddling with a trading program that would have to be remarkably successful to replace that income.<p>3) Everything costs money. You need a certain amount of capital to start with and there are all sorts of running costs. From the basic costs of execution, to market data and eventually co-location if you get that far. The fact that the OP kicked off with an amount that's essentially the barest minimum for any kind active trading is exceptional.<p>4) Can you maintain discipline and continue executing on all of the above while losing money?

4750129,comment,4749574,4749574,51,0,tokenadult,,,"The system here in Minnesota works much better. All ballots are paper ballots that are indelibly marked by voters. My wife and I voted this morning in our busy precinct in Minnesota, where there are some tight statewide contests about constitutional amendments and perhaps the most contested race for our state's House of Representatives of any electoral district in our state. As usual, we voted by marking bubble-shaped spaces on a paper ballot with a black pen. That provides an excellent audit trail for the voting. Machines can count such paper ballots very rapidly, and they are user-friendly for voters, and there is little ambiguity about how to vote. Minnesota has had ballots like this for at least a decade.<p>But even at that, when a state has a razor-thin margin in an election, it can be maddening to figure out what happened.<p><a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/11/franken-coleman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/11/franken-c...</a><p><a href=""http://www.factcheck.org/elections/mining_the_minnesota_recount.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.factcheck.org/elections/mining_the_minnesota_reco...</a><p>The election to the United States Senate from Minnesota in 2008 was too close to call before the election, and even after millions of Minnesotans voted for one of three major party candidates, the margin between the top two candidates, Democrat Al Franken and Republican Norm Coleman, was so close that the margin was only one-hundredth of 1 percent of the votes cast in the election. That election really underscored the slogan ""every vote counts.""<p>It's quite indefensible to use a voting system that doesn't leave a literal paper trail. The technology is well proven. But what really gives most election results legitimacy and staying power is a wide enough margin among votes cast by people who show up to vote that the old saying ""Vox populi, vox Dei"" can apply to the result. The people speak, and even the voters who didn't agree with the plurality have to listen. It's appalling that any state would have a voting system that could obscure what the consensus of the voters is.<p>AFTER EDIT: Thanks for the several replies to this comment. Reading other replies posted to this thread since I first wrote this comment, I see several mentions of the systems in the Pacific Northwest states of having mail ballots mailed to voters. When I lived in Taiwan, more than a decade ago, I had a post office box there. Sometimes I would receive postal mail from the United States for the previous holders of that post office box, including State of Oregon ballots for two different Oregon voters (who were presumably each other's roommates while living in Taiwan). I always wondered, without giving into the temptation, whether I could have successfully filled out one (or both?) of those ballots and mailed them back from Taiwan to cast votes in an Oregon election. By contrast, I was never able to cast a Minnesota absentee ballot from Taiwan, even the time when I should have been regarded as having a stable permanent residence address here in the United States. So I missed out on voting in both the 1984 election and the ever-so-controversial election of 2000. I have no clear awareness of how mail ballots are authenticated as having been mailed by the voter to whom they belong (a signature on the envelope?) and hope that someone is checking to prevent those ballots from being misused.",1352229799

Just like buying a widget from Apple is done based on certain expectations based on the history of previous widgets, a political party instantly tells most voters what that person is for or against.<p>This is <i>incredibly convenient</i> to the vast majority of voters; and<p>2. The current state of politics in the US I think reflect's Hotelling's Law [1]. The parties have converged on the middle so they each get roughly half the vote. With such close elections and narrow balances of power in the House and Senate things are going to stay ugly.<p>Look no further than the current distribution of seats in the Australian House of Representatives [2] where the Gillard government clings to power with the support of 3 independents and 1 Green (76-74), a change of a single seat could change the government.<p>This has inevitably led to some bitter disputes [3] [4] that would be non-issues or much smaller issues if the government had a large working majority.<p>The problem with the US is not the electoral college or that only swing states matter (which largely misses the point). Popular vote deciding the president would be a fundamental change to the system that would (IMHO) ultimately lead to disaster when a close enough election repeated the turmoil of the 2000 Florida recount across the entire country.<p>The problem is that:<p>1. Voting <i>isn't</i> mandatory and the population is apathetic;<p>2. Voting is too hard being on a weekday and involving long waiting times. I would also argue that the long waiting times are symptomatic of (1). Partisan election officials have a vested interest in deterring or encouraging the vote in certain areas;<p>3. The FPTP (first past the post) system reinforces the two-party system whereas preferential voting systems allow ""protest votes"" without them being wasted or, worse, an effective vote for the other side;<p>4. Here's the big one: people are too predictable in how they vote. Of those that vote, 40% vote Democrat, 40% vote Republican and 20% decide the election. The Biggest electoral landslides in history (Reagan in 84 and Nixon in 72) have both garnered less than 60% of the popular vote.<p>This problem is so bad that in the redistricting process [5] there are maps produced of political persuasions that are used by the incumbent state government to redraw boundaries to maximize ""their"" Congressional delegation. This process is incredibly accurate because people are so predictable.<p>IMHO the choices in this election are pretty terrible. Romney, with his 47% and his ""binders full of women"" is a joke. Obama is the most IP-friendly and consumer and tech hostile president in history, from championing in secret a treaty (the original ACTA) that would've raised file-sharing to the level of terrorism and turned the FBI into the RIAA and MPAA's enforcement arm to filling the DoJ and judiciary with RIAA lawyers to his stance on software patents.<p>My advice? Given bad choices, which seem to abound, vote against the incumbent. The one thing politicians seem to fear is losing office with all the power and perks that come with it.<p>If this means you vote for a party you otherwise wouldn't, consider this: it's also important that your party doesn't take your vote for granted.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotellings_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotellings_law</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Australia)#Current_distribution_of_seats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Austr...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/2012/10/09/australian-speaker-weakens-gov-grip-quitting/3P1RG5mO2uvmPN77oHgMCP/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/2012/10/09/australian-...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/australian-lawmaker-thomson-s-home-raided-amid-corruption-probe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/australian-lawmaker...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting</a>",1352229715

You say that your blog requires comments and wouldn't exist without them. To me, that sounds a lot more like a <i></i>discussion forum<i></i> than a blog.<p>Look at any top blog today, do they <i>need</i> comments. Would they disappear without them? Or, are the comments just a nice feature that people enjoy, but doesn't really change the nature of what they publish?<p>To me, comments are to blogs as radios are to cars. Sure, most cars have radios, but they don't need them to function. It makes the definition a whole lot more inclusive, and it should ring true to everyone. Cars of old did not have radios, blogs of old did not have comments, but as they've aged they both added new features that people enjoy (radios and comments), but to function properly, neither needs them.<p>If a ""blog"" is dependent on comments, I argue that it isn't a blog, because what is a blog but an online journal? Each of the five definitions I posted (four of which you failed to even look at or comment on) says that blogs are online diaries or journals based on experiences or hobbies. Only Wikipedia mentions comments, and only Wikipedia says ""most good"" blogs have them. While they may have them, there is no functional requirement that they have to be there, same with the car radio.<p>All cellphones have more functions than just calling a phone number and being portable. They can all store contacts in them, most have calculators, most have some personalizations you can make. Because they all have contacts, and most have calculators, do all cellphones <i>have</i> to have them to be considered a cellphone?<p>----<p>Your server part irks me. It irks me because it's wrong. You're defining the software that runs <i>on top of</i> the server as the server itself. Generic servers (apache, lighttpd, nginx, thin, etc) have no idea how to process a *back call. They can read POST requests, but they'll just forward that on to the software running on top of the server.<p>Sure, one could modify them to know how to process those requests in the specified manner, but than they wouldn't be the generic server, they'd be a specialized server.",1352229548

Even if you accept that the general public will not be able to verify it (bad!), how would you make it verifiable even for experts? It's almost impossible to ensure that the code being run is the one you verified beforehand, especially on such a large scale, so this way is out of the question. (Remember, this is a high-stakes game, so you'd better know that your CPU in fact executes your opcodes correctly...)<p>2) Electronic voting & tallying opens the door for large-scale manipulation without leaving traces. If you want to remove 10000 paper ballots, you have to somehow get rid of them (with people watching). 10000 votes vanishing in a computer? No problem, just a memory operation, a bystander would never notice it.<p>Some of this can be dealt with by having the machine print out a paper ballot immediately after voting, and keeping those ballots.

This is a first step by Microsoft to eventually force everyone to the Windows Store. Whether having to go through the Windows store is bad is debatable. (Yes, they will take a big chunk of profit, which for games is pretty much par, but for your average standalone Windows app is not what they are used to.)",1352228605

4749966,comment,4749435,4749435,8,0,MortenK,,,"Microsoft should probably have made a clear divide between tablet and desktop OS. Windows RT tablets running only the interface formerly known as Metro, and simply an incremental upgrade to the much loved Windows 7 for desktops.<p>Mixing the interfaces gives a non-satisfactory and confusing experience on both desktop and tablet devices. An exception could be devices that are a bit more of a  laptop/tablet hybrid than the Surface (i.e. the coming Surface Pro).<p>It seems MS might still be limited a bit by their big-corp shackles. The whole Windows RT / Windows 8 issue causes more confusion than anything else, and ultimately seems as a decision made by commitee, rather than the result of a single, focused individual or team.<p>But Microsoft is just at step 1. And with the size of their pockets, they will not give up the tablet race just because of a not-quite-as-hot-as-expected launch. They are in it for years to come, so it would be odd if we don't see a much better implementation over the coming 2-3 years.<p>Whether or not Apple or Google manages to innovate further in that time remains to be seen. But from the uninspiring, incremental upgrades coming out of Cupertino the last few product cycles, it could seem MS is being given the chance to catch up within the foreseeable future.<p>In any case, computing in the hybrid form of a tablet form factor with full OS and keyboard / trackpad is here to stay judging from the huge success of the Transformer series and the more limited but still substantial success of the Windows 7 slates. So we will surely see a lot of interesting products released from all camps over the next few years.",1352228545

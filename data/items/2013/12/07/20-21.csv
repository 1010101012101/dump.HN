(Roughly where we count the modern western world from.maybe)<p>From the Antikythera mechanism to Hero&#x27;s steam engines, model planes in Mexico and ball bearings on Roman emperors ships, humans did not lack invention, but what bound the modern world together was not better inventors but cheap printing and wider distribution of those ideas so they would not die out when one location failed.<p>I suspect that civilisations occur when they make the retention and spread of ideas pass a critical mass (ie the empire provides sufficient protection that an idea created in one place can find a home elsewhere in the empire (comms network)",1386449961

Smart people can maybe make two leaps, but most people have trouble making a mental leap that&#x27;s further than one step away from what they know. So you start with &quot;X for Y&quot; as a mental hook to hang their mental hat on. Then you can build from there.<p>Whether it&#x27;s actually an original idea or not depends on nuances of the space, that most people aren&#x27;t use to talking about, unless they usually think of this sort of thing.

6867658,story,,,1,2,Techmeology,"How to sell an open source Android game?",,"A while ago, I wrote a simple strategy game based on Reversi, but with a few key differences in the rules. I showed it to some of my friends, who really enjoyed it, so I wrote an open source Android version called Chain Reversi over the summer, and published it on the Android app store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.techmeology.chainreversi&hl=en). I had hoped to earn some money from it, but so far I haven&#x27;t managed to get anyone other than my friends interested in buying it since my skills are mainly in technology rather than marketing. I decided to make the game open source because I figured that might get a few people (who care about stuff like that) interested who might then share it with their friends and get some exposure for my game, but that hasn&#x27;t happened. How have my fellow Shashdotters gotten their success in selling on the Android app store?",1386449852

In both cases, the dividing cells propagate their inherited traits that allow them to evade the immune system or treatment.<p>When you treat a person with a cancer drug, the cancer tumor population evolves (selection and natural variation), when you treat a population with an antibiotic, the bacterial population evolves.

It rather seems to mean that nobody goes into the field of nuclear engineering with the expectation of experimentation and &quot;having fun&quot; while working. It has nothing to do with expense, danger, illegality, working with universities, doing it in your basement, or any of that. It has to do with commercial interests not supporting their engineers in experimenting with possible designs.",1386449846

I survived testicular cancer this year, which happens to be one of a group of cancers that is almost completely curable. Thirty years ago it was not the same story, with a 90% five year mortality. Now it&#x27;s 95% five year survival. That said, two close family members passed away this year from other types of cancer, one kidney and another colorectal.<p>I guess my point is that each type of cancer potentially requires a different cure, and some are easier nuts to crack than others.

Uni&#x27;s were free, but seeing how much the &#x27;stupid americans&#x27; were paying (thanks to leverage), the UK started to reduce grants to &#x27;tap into the damand&#x27;, and they now purposefully issue debt to students as a from of highly targeted TAX.<p>The demand comes from the &#x27;social marker&#x27; heuristic that a university degree conveys (ie, social proof) for employment and personal networking. Until there is a competing &quot;commodity&quot; whith this aspect of social utility, a degree with have economic value proportional to  GDP, in a way like housing stock. The main problem with <i>broad based</i> inflation of the costs of college is that there is only so much &quot;beach front&quot; real estate in the degree system. The top 10 schools are typically the ones that matter, for social signalling, and quite frankly nobody cares how much you paid to get the degree. A &quot;free&quot; degree from cambridge (UK) has a good value, just like a $$$ degree from MIT or Stanford. Heck, many will argue a <dropout> from a top 5 school has more going for them than a degree holder from a middle of the pack school.<p>The great thing about Berkeley is its one of the <i>few</i> state schools that has a powerful global reputation. And in that sense it remains good value for money (if you are a resident Californian).

When I was an undergrad, DOE was willing to <i>pay</i> the university the entire relicensing and operating costs of the on-campus TRIGA. The university declined, knowing that the requisite environmental impact study for relicensing would bring withering community backlash.<p>(For those who haven&#x27;t seen one, here&#x27;s what it looks like when the control rods are blown out of a TRIGA [1]; the reactor runs away momentarily, but then self-moderates when the fuel warms.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orNP1wMmPK4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orNP1wMmPK4</a> . The Cherenkov flash is a beautiful blue.)<p>Nuclear power can provide a safe, well-studied, and effective bridge to solar power. Almost nobody&#x27;s dabbling in it because there&#x27;s so much societal opposition. Working on a reactor in an old schoolhouse in a rural area? Someone elsewhere in the county will be willing to speak at every county governmental meeting to shut you down. Their opposition has merit; it&#x27;s easy to point to Fukushima and Chernobyl as major disasters.<p>A simple, clear, and publicly-understandable regulatory framework in which both society and innovators can feel comfortable with small-scale nuclear experimentation would go a long way toward driving new startups in the field. Experimenters shouldn&#x27;t get their hopes up too far: Some forms of radiation are extremely penetrating/hard to shield, and some hazardous isotopes live a long, long time. If you&#x27;re dabbling in the field, please plan from the beginning to minimize and safely store your waste.<p>We only get one planet; I&#x27;d rather it not be too warm nor contaminated by our litter.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIGA\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIGA</a>",1386448175

However, it mutates incredibly quickly compared to other viruses - an HIV+ patient may have multiple strains of the virus in their body at any one time, requiring the infamous &quot;cocktail&quot; of drugs as no single drug will be effective.<p>Vaccinations have been (so far) ineffective because they attempt to vaccinate against a rapidly moving target.<p>Hepatitis B, on the other hand, is a much more easily-transmitted virus, and yet we have been able to develop a reasonably effective vaccine against it[0]. For a while, it used to be standard practice to vaccinate all young children against Hepatitis B; I&#x27;m not sure if it still is.<p>Unfortunately, Hepatitis C, which kills more people in the US than HIV/AIDS[1], is arguably even worse - it is also much easier to transmit than HIV, but we don&#x27;t have a vaccine against it either. Furthermore, because most of the public campaigns advocating safe sex and clean needles use HIV-specific language, many people aren&#x27;t aware that it is such a huge threat. Like HIV, it is asymptomatic for several years, so as many as <i>75%</i> of people infected with Hepatitis C don&#x27;t even know it[2]:<p>Epidemiologically (not politically) Hepatitis C today is similar to the state of HIV in the 80s and 90s[3]. We have some medications to treat it, but they&#x27;re not very effective - living with Hepatitis C is oftentimes <i>worse</i> than living with HIV.<p>[0] As with all vaccines, it is imperfect, which is why coverage across the general population is the best approach to eradication or containment.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C#Epidemiology\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C#Epidemiology</a>.<p>[2] <a href=\"http://m.cdc.gov/en/VitalSigns/hepatitis-c\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://m.cdc.gov/en/VitalSigns/hepatitis-c</a><p>[3] At least outside the US - the US was one of the last countries to approve HIV antiretrovirals, which incidentally is the topic of a movie currently in theatres: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Buyers_Club\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Buyers_Club</a>",1386447896

They are almost always in mice or something and I or someone else with a similar background always feels compelled to weigh in and remind folks that it&#x27;s a long way from curing lab rats to curing people.<p>This however, is the real deal. It&#x27;s quite remarkable and there&#x27;s likely more stories like this for other diseases on the way.<p>I went to a gene therapy session this fall at the American Society of Human Genetics conference in Boston and was blown away by some of the success people are having. I quipped to colleagues that I felt like I was in a science fiction movie. The most remarkable one was where they used an approach similar to the one here to cure a fatal metabolic disorder (relaying this from memory, so some of my recollection may be off). Kids with the disorder have a busted enzyme that causes slow degeneration of neurons. They don&#x27;t live past 6 or 7 if I recall. The team showed how modifying a certain kind of stem cell found in the body normally to have the correct copy of the enzyme cured several patients. The corrected cells naturally move to the brain where they differentiate into glial cells and produce the correct copy of the enzyme. It turns out that because the neurons in the brain are starved for this enzyme, they express receptors that allow them to take it up from the environment. So the repaired glial cells supply enzyme to the entire brain (i.e. it&#x27;s not necessary to modify every neuron in the brain to have a correct copy of the enzyme). They can completely cure kids with this approach. All of their muscular and neurological tests are 100% normal.<p>They had videos of these kids running around and playing just as if nothing was wrong. In one case, a younger brother lived but his older sister (who was too old when the therapy came out) had died. It was hard not to get choked up looking at their smiling, happy faces as they ran around, thinking that if this therapy hadn&#x27;t existed, they would be in a nearly vegetative state.<p>Gene therapy had a rough start with the early setbacks, but I&#x27;m getting the sense that the tide is rapidly turing.",1386446521

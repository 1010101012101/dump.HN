8634168,comment,8633683,8633683,0,0,NamTaf,,,"I note that many of the questions are around the processes, training, rules, etc. that govern the use of technology developed by Uber. This is important.<p>Systems Engineering teaches the concept of POSTED: People, Organisation, Support, Training, Equipment and Doctrine. When a system is developed, it must give consideration to all of these aspects. Failing to do so means you design an incomplete system.<p>In this case, Uber has developed a piece of Equipment, their God Mode view. Franken&#x27;s asking about the other pieces of the system, such as the training, support and doctrine and people. These are equally as important to design, document and implement. Failing to give due consideration to these aspects of the system is no different to having an incomplete equipment solution developed. I&#x27;m interested to see whether Uber gave due consideration to these aspects of the system.<p>There&#x27;s something to be said about startups moving fast to develop technology but not necessarily the other aspects of a complete system. Mature systems engineering / software development firms do this day in and day out. Yes, it can lead to slower iteration on the core technology and capabilities, but it is critically important to consider. I suspect it&#x27;s often a pinch point when start-ups try to scale, for example when a piece of technology then needs to consider user access rights, etc.",1416451927

However, there are a number of other issues here which seem systemic and much more troubling.  First, that your &quot;flighting&quot; did not catch the problem.  Why was that?  If the bug caused an infinite loop on all the live storage systems, that seems like it should have been fairly obvious on the customer systems you tested on.  Second, that the patch was rolled out to all servers at the same time.  You have admitted this was a mistake, but honestly it looks like amateur hour.  If you are running business critical distributed cloud infrastructure, you just don&#x27;t ever do this.  Third, that there was extended fallout from rolling the patch back.  If there are still customers experiencing downtime from this problem a full day later, that speaks to some serious flaws in the ops architecture and process.  If you guys want to compete with AWS and similar platforms, it seems like you have a long way to go still.

It&#x27;s not as valuable as screenage that&#x27;s normally in the centre of your vision, but it&#x27;s still very useful (assuming it isn&#x27;t too distorted by the viewing angle). You may have to move your eyes and maybe even slightly move your head to see what&#x27;s out there clearly, but (I strongly assume - I&#x27;m not an expert) that kind of glancing should still be a lot more (yuck) &quot;spatial&quot; and less distracting than having to alt-tab or whatever to reveal the same information and then to hide it again. So in concrete terms, a 40&quot; 16:9 4K monitor like <a href=""http://www.tomshardware.com/news/philips-4k-bdm4065uc-monitor,27977.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomshardware.com/news/philips-4k-bdm4065uc-monito...</a> which has slightly greater vertical height than the 26.5&quot; 1:1 1920×1920 screen as well as higher ppi ought to be preferable if price, horizontal desk space or whatever don&#x27;t rule it out.<p>Unfortunately, OSes and other software tend to mess this up: in particular, the fact that those handy fullscreen commands actually fill the screen with the selected window or picture or video or whatever is no longer good news if some or all of the edges of your screen are far enough away from the comfortable centre area of your vision (see <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-large-display-paradox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-large-display-paradox/</a> ). This was appropriate behaviour in the past, when both pixels and screen inches were limited and expensive and so it was safe to assume that the whole of the screen was well within the user&#x27;s central viewing area—and in fact was probably covering much less of that central area than was at all ideal. Nowadays the user should be able to define a central fullscreen area that (possibly) doesn&#x27;t take up the whole screen: then (by default etc.) fullscreened items should be expanded to the limits of the &quot;fullscreen&quot; area and no more. The rest of the screen can be filled with other information: maybe the other open windows pushed to the side in an OS X Exposé-like manner, or things like image metadata for a viewed image. The brightness of the outer area should be subdued to prevent it from distracting from the central image. (A practical use for whizzy translucency effects!). The information out in the &quot;gutter&quot; will be glanceable, but won&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s impinging on your view of the fullscreened item (if it <i>does</i>, you didn&#x27;t make the fullscreen area large enough).",1416451083

They want you to walk past things you didn&#x27;t intend to buy and then buy them.<p>Ever wonder why household necessities are always at opposite back corners of grocery stores? They want you to spend as much time there as possible and pass as many shelves as possible.<p>Yes, there is a &quot;problem&quot; here for consumers, but it&#x27;s one they will generally solve by using Amazon or the online pick-up systems that stores already have. You can already browse the inventory of stores and have your items waiting for you when you arrive.<p>Furthermore, because every store creates this problem, no store has an incentive to fix it.<p>If Target, for example, were to spend money on &quot;TailSearch&quot; (a LOT of money) and minorly improve the user experience at the cost of much of their sales volume, they would be screwed.<p>And what would the real benefit for the user be? Do you go to stores because it&#x27;s easy to find things or because they have what you want at the price you want?<p>This is simple technology, and it could easily piggyback on the databases that tech-savvy companies like Wal-Mart already have.

Assuming nothing about Uber&#x27;s user terms and agreements aren&#x27;t unlawful, it&#x27;s almost certainly the case that, as alluded to by Franken&#x27;s letter, users of Uber have agreed to provide Uber with this sort of access to their usage of the app.<p>So while I agree with the spirit of what Frankin is saying, I&#x27;m just left with distaste for what obvious posturing and pandering it is.",1416449275

Any rational investor would be frothing to get involved in that sort of business - it becomes a money-printing machine in short order.<p>That&#x27;s not 100% true.<p>1) Growth rates like this are not sustainable long-term, and a 9% growth rate doesn&#x27;t look great when lots of other companies are at 15-25% monthly growth with similar revenues.<p>2) The revenues multiples for Series A startup are very high. Would I invest in a $600k revenue/year startup growing 9% monthly at a $4m valuation? Sure, that sounds good. But a Series A would be more like investing $5m at a $25m valuation, which is way higher than the startup is worth based on pure fundamentals. The reason to invest at a $25m valuation is because you think there&#x27;s a 10% shot the startup will be worth $500m, not because you think it&#x27;s a 100% shot at $25m. High growth rates are one of the best indicators that a startup has a shot at $500m.<p>(My fund does seed/Series A investments.)",1416448935

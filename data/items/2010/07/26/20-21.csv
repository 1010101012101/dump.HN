The most uncomfortable flight I've ever had was from ATL -> Tokyo because the seats were so close together.

From the URLs I'm guessing that the colors correspond to <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, <i>C. indica</i>, and hybrid strains -- it would be helpful to see some explanation of this.<p>2. On the pages for individual strains, there are lists of descriptors (e.g. a strain might make people feel ""Energetic""). These should be clickable, if someone wants to see what other strains are most strongly associated with those descriptors. You already have something like this on your Explore page, so the plumbing for this shouldn't be too terribly hard.

The Roman republic and early modern England are good examples of this.<p>I think democracy is necessary - but not sufficient - to maintain stability in the state and moderation in the laws.  The cultural problem we face today is that the popular perception of democracy has shifted from seeing it as a mechanism by which the public can protect itself against the abuse of power to seeing it as a legitimizing factor for the assertion of power; institutions are criticized for being ""undemocratic"" on the latter basis, targeted for reform, and the end result is that our laws become increasingly unbalanced and excessive.",1280177723

I am trying to fight it (have to due to peer pressure to make money). It has come to my losing interest in anything. I used to love programming for the sole reason of enjoyment. I haven't made any changes to my lifestyle (I probably cannot). Last 3 weeks, I have been in the 'isolation phase' My work place, it's a farce of work with people pretending to get work done with unnecessary complex sub systems. My family raised concerns (they understand my phase, my wife often tells me to pursue academics, as I seen not raised for the corporate world). It's only when three members in my family asked the same question, I started to wonder. I have a thousand things in my mind and a struggling pain of not accomplishing anything. I encounter this every single minute of the day.  I am so stressed by the whole lagging behind the world that I feel I cannot learn anything new. I have finished the first chapters of how to prove it, foundations of computer science and algorithms book. Although I am interested, I find myself lacking the motivation to continue...And this adds up, days to weeks and then months. Then the cumulative depression rides me to hell. The thought that someone started learning math about 6 years ago when I too picked interest and the comparison istantly drives me for a whole day of depression. During those days, I don't absorb a thing of what I read. \nI shake my legs when I think and I think all day. I am supposed to working on getting xml schema related work done and I am here shaking my legs and thinking.\nI have frequented HN enough to know to that I should visit a doctor.

I want to try out (but feel I cannot due to the money factor). I have to earn the bread.  I fight with myself saying 'there is do or do not, there is no try', the difference between doing it and thinking about it. I have all the motivation inside, but I just cannot bring myself to do anything. I can never finish any task that I start. This has been going for years. My sanity is still in positive numbers, thanks to my wife.<p>could you share how did you come out of this phase (perhaps there is much more than just moving to a different job).

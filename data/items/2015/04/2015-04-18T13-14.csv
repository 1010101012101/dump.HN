On commercial TV here the sound range is compressed/normalized enough during the shows & ads that I never have to tweak the volume.  But Netflix movies seem to have 4x the dynamic range - I have to turn the volume up twice as loud to hear whispered dialog, and turn it down to 1/4 the volume for a car crash / fight scene.  I&#x27;ve had to resort to using headphones when watching at night instead.",1429365580

And facts are extremely hard things to find. With all the money we spend on science, we have  a relatively small number of them. What individuals have is mainly opinions about facts.<p>That&#x27;s why discussions seeking truth are such hard and subtle work. It&#x27;s also why facts are frequently irrelevant to people&#x27;s behaviors in this realm. See, for example, this graph:<p><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/149390/record-high-approve-black-white-marriages.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/149390/record-high-approve-black-...</a><p>It isn&#x27;t a graph of people coming to reasoned understanding on a topic. It&#x27;s a graph of people with old opinions dying off.<p>> It is possible for a PhD to learn something from an undergrad. Moreover, it isn&#x27;t strictly less understanding anyway, it&#x27;s a different perspective. Which is all the more reason why people should try to hear each other.<p>I strongly believe it is <i>less</i> understanding. As a member of various dominant groups, my understanding of things like race and gender was very coarse. That&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t have to pay any attention to those things; they almost always worked in my favor. When that&#x27;s not the case, people are forced to pay more attention.<p>If you want to argue that generally attention does not lead to better understanding, you&#x27;re really arguing that discussion is futile, because a major function of discussion is to turn people&#x27;s attention to a topic.<p>> Not listening to someone (i.e. ignoring them) is not the same thing as attacking them because they said something you don&#x27;t want to hear.<p>I agree with that, but don&#x27;t see its relevance to the discussion.

Spotify uses Postgres for the same.  All of them also use other things as well, but only for cases where they are willing to make performance or reliability trade-offs like for colder or analytical data.  Of course they also use things like Sherpa, Cassandra, HBase, etc... but they lose consistent low latency or consistency or availability when they do so.<p>The point is, if you are going to bet your business on a technology, it helps if it has been tested with production workloads in many different conditions and scales.  You want to know about as many shortcomings as you can.  For many of the use cases that people use things like Cassandra for, they will be tolerant of 30ms++ reads and potential read inversions.  Redis is used pretty heavily, but it is relatively simple code and you can trace through the entire writepath pretty easily and get a sense of its limitations (being single threaded is a blessing and a curse, you really need to be careful about bad tenants because a single slow query will cause an availability event for everyone).  HBase is used in a few places, but usually only for cold data after they expect it to be read only occasionally and they don&#x27;t want to use up space on their MySQL pci flash devices for it anymore.

- I&#x27;m a full-time project manager in a small company, spending my spare time on validating various ideas for products and working as a freelancer.
- On validating ideas, I mean coding & public launching MVP to test whether somebody else need it.
- I&#x27;m running a small  Linux VPS server with Ubuntu 14.04<p>Problem:
- I have permanent pain in the ass because of absolute absence of backups.
- I have GitHub for my code but nothing for DB and UGC files.
- Snapshot solutions (which are provided by provider) do not fit my needs.
- As mentioned above, I have some coding skills but I&#x27;m an absolute dummy in server administration, configuring remote backups, etc. All I know is just how to run several ssh commands and how to restart my server =)<p>Ask:
- Do you know any solutions that are really easy to use for Linux servers?
Small demands: solution for Linux, easy, very easy to use, remote backup (to Amazon, Azure, nearline or elsewhere), storage is included or easy to connect (e.g. I just have to provide my credentials for as s3), SSL, support for MySQL.<p>I&#x27;ve totally messed up trying to find such solution.
Already tried:
- Acronis backup to cloud (too complicated and expensive for me)
- snapshots provided by hosting 
- Rsync (just syncs  deletion all missed files and is not easy for me :)
- bacula (did not understand how to use it on a server)
- searchув open source scripts on GitHub but stuck due to lack of knowledge and inability to understand the code<p>Hope you&#x27;ll help.

He based his ranking of possible civilizations on the basis of total energy output which could be quantified and used as a guide to explore the dynamics of advanced civilizations:<p>Type I: this civilization harnesses the energy output of an entire planet.<p>Type II: this civilization harnesses the energy output of a star, and generates about 10 billion times the energy output of a Type I civilization.<p>Type III: this civilization harnesses the energy output of a galaxy, or about 10 billion time the energy output of a Type II civilization.<p>A Type I civilization would be able to manipulate truly planetary energies. They might, for example, control or modify their weather. They would have the power to manipulate planetary phenomena, such as hurricanes, which can release the energy of hundreds of hydrogen bombs. Perhaps volcanoes or even earthquakes may be altered by such a civilization.<p>A Type II civilization may resemble the Federation of Planets seen on the TV program Star Trek (which is capable of igniting stars and has colonized a tiny fraction of the near-by stars in the galaxy). A Type II civilization might be able to manipulate the power of solar flares.<p>A Type III civilization may resemble the Borg, or perhaps the Empire found in the Star Wars saga. They have colonized the galaxy itself, extracting energy from hundreds of billions of stars.<p>By contrast, we are a Type 0 civilization, which extracts its energy from dead plants (oil and coal). Growing at the average rate of about 3% per year, however, one may calculate that our own civilization may attain Type I status in about 100-200 years, Type II status in a few thousand years, and Type III status in about 100,000 to a million years. These time scales are insignificant when compared with the universe itself.<p>On this scale, one may now rank the different propulsion systems available to different types of civilizations:<p>Type 0<p>Chemical rockets, 
Ionic engines, 
Fission power, 
EM propulsion (rail guns)<p>Type I<p>Ram-jet fusion engines, 
Photonic drive<p>Type II<p>Antimatter drive,

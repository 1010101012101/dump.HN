149370,comment,149052,149189,0,0,swombat,,,"It might be worth expanding the lower levels to include more than name-calling and ad-hominem, then. There's a huge variety of dirty tactics that can be used, and name-calling and ad-hominem are just two of the more obvious ones. A good list can be obtained at:<p><a href=""http://www.vandruff.com/art_converse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vandruff.com/art_converse.html</a><p>Perhaps it's worth adding a link in the article, clarifying that DH1 actually includes a whole set of techniques described at that URL (and other places).<p>Daniel",1206791752

I think it helps a  lot to look at their underlying motivation and to crank up the bullshit detector.",1206791538
149368,comment,149052,149247,0,0,zoltz,,,"You seem to imply in the essay that disagreeing comments are more valuable than agreeing ones, though:<p>""<i>And when you agree there's less to say. You could expand on something the author said, but he has probably already explored the most interesting implications. When you disagree you're entering territory he may not have explored</i>""",1206791078
149367,comment,149170,149170,0,0,jsrn,,,"Constraints can be good. The article reminded me of the tales of 'oldschool' hackers saying that lacking resources of early computers forced them to write good and compact code. The scarcity of a resource obviously leads to this resource being valued higher than if it would be available in abundance.<p>What I find noteworthy, however, are his examples: the resources described are constrained artificially, yet are still valued higher than if not constrained (and competing services not constraining the resource (Flickr or normal Blogs in his example) couldn't destroy this mechanism).<p>When, however, does this mechanism take place? When email accounts where strongly constrained in storage space, GMail with its then 1Gig storage was seen as liberation (the opposite effect).",1206791004
149366,comment,149052,149218,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Depends on what you mean by ""the best way to disagree"". If you are preaching to the choir (and most disagreements on the web fall into this category), then mocking is the best way, because it entertains, whereas the alternative does nothing at all.<p>But if you care about making someone understand your argument for the first time, why would you put extra layers on it, which will have to be unwrapped to get to the inner logic?<p>I think I know why most people do it. The point made in the form of mockery is laborious to refute, so nobody bothers. And if somebody bothers, the refutation is laborious to follow, so nobody bothers to read it. Thus mockery, however idiotic, often stays unrefuted, and to the author and his camp that's close enough to ""correct"".<p>Have you been to Reddit lately? Half of all disagreements are in the form of (idiotic) mockery. It wasn't like this early on.",1206790791
149365,comment,148600,148743,0,0,eusman,,,"i agree with you that they may had any other idea and be determined about it, but if the idea wasn't what people needed it wouldn't have the enormous success it had.",1206790089
149364,comment,149317,149317,0,0,yangyang42,,,"I don't have any good books in mind, but I think you need to know what you're really interested in learning about hardware. Define ""very, very familiar with electronics.""<p>You might want to think about electronics on several level and topics:<p>- Board Level: Op Amps, Feedback Control Systems... etc.<p>- Chip Level IC design: Analog IC design, Bipolar/CMOS design... etc.<p>- Firmware: C, Assembly language...<p>...each of these topics are semester/year long courses on its own. I can recommend books in each topic, but have not seen a do-it-all, teach-it-all book.<p>as attack said, ""the topic area is more broad than you'd think.""",1206789397
149363,comment,148773,148830,0,0,Emmjaykay,,,"I agree and disagree. I don't think that romance is dumb. In fact, courtship and companionship seems like it would be wonderful, sublime.<p>However, reading your other comments about risk and so forth, I can feel myself resigning to agreement. It does seem like it would be a heavy risk and certain to fail. I can't explain why I'm so risk-averse where as other things in my life seem just as unsure.",1206789367
149361,comment,149258,149258,0,0,brentr,,,"Creating a comment limit would, theoretically, reduce the DH0-DH3 responses. Let's examine this.<p>Let us assume that X gets n units of utility for every point of karma the community awards.<p>Let us further assume that the community only awards points of karma for insightful posts/comments. This appears to be a safe assumption.<p>If X knew that comments/posts were scarce, which under your proposal they would be, then X will attempt to maximize the karma earned from each comment/post by maximizing the insightful nature of each comment/post.<p>In a way, karma whoring would actually curtail garbage comments/posts, if comments/posts were a scarce resource.",1206788774

149359,comment,149248,149248,0,0,brk,,,"For starters the comment you cite does not look like ""raised a valid issue"", it <i>looks</i> like ""silly 13 year old comment"", and I think it was modded appropriately.  Had he provided some other thoughts or datapoints to back up his position, or even just stated his case in a more normal manner (""No, I think romance is dumb.  It takes valuable time and money cycles away from my building my company"").  I did note that he provided a little more data further down in the comment stream.<p>But, to answer your question, I don't think there are conflicting interests here.  People who favor ""B"" will (hopefully) learn over time that their interests are better served by considering all arguments.  Provided of course that those arguments are actually well-reasoned and presented, and not just ""No, u r dumb"".<p>""Pro Startup"" does not have to equal ""sugar coated happy you-can-do-it"" comments.  In fact I would think most true hacker types would have gotten enough of that bullshit in school and would crave honest feedback.",1206788401

But there's an opportunity for employers that use these kinds of databases to get less shitty results than the employers who advertise and read every resume they receive :-)<p>So we are in agreement of sorts: if youa re asking employees to submit their friends, read every resume. If you are dealing with a hiuge data set--and monster.com is a hiuge data set--filtering helps.<p>That being said, using a filter--no matter how well trained--on monster.com is still a terrible way to hire.

129846,comment,129689,129727,0,0,apathy,,,"You end your article with 'Bayesian filters will not outperform a human in hiring'.  But that's not the point.<p>A classifier, and especially a supervised classifier, is really just a tool for intelligence amplification.  Make a dumb man perform smarter, and a smart man perform better than almost anyone without the advantage.  Similar to providing physicians with a checklist for common procedures which has been developed by iterative analysis of outcomes.  It's very hard to become a physician if you're dumb or lazy, but it's quite easy to get fatigued on a 36-hour residency shift, or get complacent if some 'trivial' procedure interrupts your microsurgery specialty.  And the stakes are far higher in most surgical interventions.<p>Naturally, many doctors resist.  But the best figure out how to use this to their advantage.  It increases the efficiency of the system.  Likewise, having the 'advice' of a machine that has been trained on a corpus of good multiple-human-actor decisions, over time, can provide individuals with better judgment than their experience alone.  This is more apparent with a larger corpus and finer-grained classification -- eg. multidimensional classification with a huge corpus and eigenclasses of suitability.  Game that, and you're smart enough to be in management, most likely ;-)<p>So, I don't believe you should let your detractors off so easily.  Maybe a talented human will outperform an filter with a small corpus.  But I'd bet dollars to donuts that, for someone who isn't a full-time interviewer, the assistance of a well-trained filter will increase their acuity and throughput, allowing them to get on with their real jobs and worry less about dumb hires.<p>You can't really avoid the enthusiasm of junior employees who haven't been burned, and this is another scenario where a filter can help them gauge their judgment by providing a historical perspective.  ""You know the last guy we hired who interviewed like this, one of your coworkers spent 2 hours a day for 3 months training him, and then we fired him!""  That's something you want to avoid, and I have seen this happen at places like Google where you might think they'd be immune.  But once you let the dumb or negative folks in, it's all downhill from there.<p>So -- replace humans?  No.  Augment them?  Yes.  It's what computers (and statistical analyses) are meant for!",1204741893

129824,comment,129689,129783,0,0,mynameishere,,,"No, you're not suggesting otherwise. But using ""Bayesian filtering"" (or whatever variation of it) is best on huge data sets. Working manually, I could tell you with near 100 percent reliability which email is spam--better than any filter. It's inefficient for a human to do it, so a process that can remove 95 percent instead of 100 is acceptable. Inefficiency matters less as the data becomes smaller and more important.<p>Real life example: My current manager has some twisted filter on his brain, whereat he is convinced that a mastery of certain things (like design patterns, or ""OO architecture"") are extremely important.  We were interviewing a while back, and some kid said his 'proudest achievement' was a Pac-Man clone he made. Well, my manager's filter did not include the words ""Pac-Man clone"" and so we never even looked at it.<p>Every good candidate in a creative field is going to go outside the bounds of <i>any</i> filter you can come up with, training or otherwise.

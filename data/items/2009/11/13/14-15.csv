If the java code is faster, and you really need speed, just call the optimized java code.<p>If you take seriously the rule that most programs spend 90% of their cycles in a limited number of subroutines (and you rewrite those few locations in Java), you should get speed pretty much equivalent to the Java code.<p>(Of course, in benchmarks this fails, because benchmarks  generally measure the places that i might rewrite).<p>And then you use Clojure for the tricky and error-prone flow control types of jobs. I hate it when people turn this into a 'Clojure vs. Java' debate. It isn't like that.<p>It is about Clojure and Java. And I think Clojure and Java wins hands down over the Java only approach (at least for a lot of applications).",1258124270

How likely is it these days to stay long enough with one company to reap the benefits of that? My stance is: if something is included in the pay, it should also be in the contract. Empty words tend to not manifest.<p>As for the other stuff: how likely is it that the OP will be able to continue pulling 100 hour weeks in his 30ies and 40ies? I don't think it is very likely. Besides, it would be better to pull 100 hour weeks if you get 100$/hour than as a junior (that is, take it easy now, pull 100 hours as a senior).<p>Sorry if I am cynical, but so far I have never seen a company honor excellent performance. Maybe it happens, then you are lucky. But usually developers are considered to be tools. Companies don't go around looking for an excellent developer. They are looking for somebody who can do X. Therefore they only care that you do X. If you don't want to do X anymore (bored, not enough salary, whatever), they will look for somebody else to do X. It doesn't matter squat how many hours you have poured in. They also won't go ""hm, we have this excellent guy, lets see what useful thing we could make him do"". It is the other way round. They need something done and hire a guy for it. The guy's personal development is not interesting.<p>Some companies might ""see the light"" and offer personal development schemes to the employee. These however are also just meant to tie you to the company and get more work out of you.<p>Again, sorry if I am cynical - but some people end up with millions, and others just with empty words and ""experience"" of questionable value. What is wrong with simply getting your money's worth???<p>I think the main reason why young people tend to work for cheap is that they don't know how much money they will really need eventually. Just having been a student, 1000$ seems like a LOT of money. It takes a couple of years to realize that you have to save for retirement and feed a family. By that point you are old and your job will be taken over by new young developers who are underpaid.<p>Another reason to ask for good money: perhaps then the employer will think twice about putting you on boring tasks.",1258124025

Some background on me...I am a motivational speaker, writer, personal trainer, entrepreneur, life coach, etc. The reason I provide this background information is more for social proof than anything else because I have spent years of my life studying the human psyche, identity theory, and emotional pain. What I have learned is that our country has been inflicted with a disease, a plague of far reaching magnitude, where almost every person is negatively affected. I have coined this catastrophic dilemma as an IDENTITY CRISIS where you begin to live the life that someone or something has created on your behalf. This is what you are experiencing because at some point their was a ""PAIN"" which surfaced in your world, that never had the opportunity to heal, but in order to eliminate this emotion, you subconsciously allowed this wound to scab over. As you have evolved, this pain was never healed, and instead masked, but now it has SURFACED once again. I would like to assist you through this process because I have worked with countless people who also experienced exactly what you are going through.

Trusting her to be your partner and a source of strength when you need it is a tremendous compliment to her, and shows your relationship is solid.<p>Second, assess your situation rationally.  Compile a budget of what you've actually been spending; you'll be surprised to find out how much of it is discretionary.  Got a Netflix account?

Then, make sure you don't slack, but don't go nuts either--treat it like a job with defined working hours but set aside specific time to be with your family.  It's important that neither you nor your wife feel that you (lostsheep) are contributing to the family and not just lazing around letting her do all the work.

939993,comment,939032,939032,0,0,pmichaud,,,"Posted in the comments:<p>Maybe I'm exuberant in a recent life change, but I think the answer is clear.<p>Money is a metaphor -- as you said, it's a fabrication that's meaningful only in the company of others who share the delusion, but on a desert island it's just kindling. Money is a metaphor for value and we hope that the transfer of money corresponds or at least correlates to the transfer of value, as it often does.<p>So, we have this ubiquitous concept that feels like a law of nature because we're soaked in it -- as infants, educated adults, everywhere we see the effects of money. When our worldview is so thoroughly infected by a concept like money, it becomes almost impossible not to apply it to things to which it isn't fundamentally applicable.<p>Of course it's possible, in the sense of a ""dirty hack,"" to apply money to time as if time is an economic asset, but maybe that's just not true. Take our lives for example. Only a group can make an assessment of the economic value of a given life; for the person, that value is always infinity dollars.<p>But wait, you say, people choose other things over life all the time! Their country, their friends, their family, etc. They even choose to end their lives early in order to preserve their wealth for living relatives.<p>Yes! Exactly!<p>Clearly there are ""assets"" that can meaningfully compared to a human life (like love and other lives), since people regularly trade their lives for these things. Money, I think, is fundamentally not one of those.<p>Thought experiment:\n----\nI'm a rich guy. I'll give you access to an account that has $1,000,000,000 in it. You may not transfer the money, but you may spend it freely, only on yourself. In exchange for this access, I get to kill you right now. What do you say?\n----<p>So, I'm asserting that maybe--like money and lives-- the value of time can't rightly be compared to the value of money, despite how often we do it and how natural it feels, because the scale is too different. Maybe we should work toward a system that identifies things like lives and time, and divorces those things from money entirely.<p>As individuals the answer is to separate our time from income by building valuable, cash flow positive assets. That's the ""Zen Ethic"": the only way to live in a world with money that doesn't lead to misery, is to build streams of passive income.",1258121776

Using a blade grinder means introducing a huge range of differently-sized solids that will extract at different rates, meaning even if you hit a nice middle ground, you're introducing sour and bitter flavor components into your cup. Burr grinders provide a very even grind and minimize this.<p>Next time you go to a place that roasts freshly, try to take home a little bit pre-ground. It will have less flavor (due to rapid oxidization), but the flavor should be better: more balanced and consistent (as long as it was a good brew). Don't get me wrong: pull an espresso shot from just-ground coffee, and pull another one from coffee ground 15 minutes ago, and the crema deprecation is pretty amazing. Pre-grinding kills a lot of coffee's oomph. Still, blade-grinding mangles a lot of coffee's hidden potential :)",1258121240

You do not need an article on a blog - even a great blog from an expert - to justify your life decisions.<p>""Pro""-college people: Hi! You do not need to act uncomfortable because you <i>did</i> go to college. What an idea. Where's the defensiveness coming from?<p>""Try inventing anti-cancer shark-mounted LASERS without college degrees!"" / ""You sure wouldn't hire a BRAIN SURGEON without a degree!"" people: One of these things is not like the other. The kids who bypass university thinking they will strike it rich with a social network for iguanas would not go on to invent anti-gravity boots -- or torts -- if <i>only</i> they'd tough it out thru 4 years in a state school.<p>Who'd I miss?<p>Remember, folks, historically speaking, many of the world's greatest minds had no university education in their fields. And a lot of them did, too.<p>Who the fuck cares?<p>EDIT: PS: I dropped out of high school at 14. Take that!",1235743199

497185,comment,496745,496745,0,0,bsaunder,,,"This is an interesting idea.  You'd have to watch out for usage spikes that would end up dropping a large number of messages (kinda like paging... I suspect this gets worse quickly as the same message is sent multiple times).  If you put some guards on the sending side, you might be okay (but with multiple senders this could get messy quickly).<p>I suspect in the end you will grow this to the complexity of one of the already mentioned messaging solutions.  If you don't like them perhaps something like spread (odd licensing), jabber, or irc (my personal favorite) would work for you.",1235741550

Bell Labs is gone, and most companies now are focusing on applied rather than fundamental advances.<p>And before people start piling on large companies and the government with the usual rant, try to figure out how you could invent the laser, fiber optics, tcp/ip, lunar landing, orthgonal frequency division multiplexing , etc, with 2 college dropouts well-versed in rails and javascript.",1235741511

497175,comment,496675,497015,0,0,vidarh,,,"The point of the advice is that if you cut too much your body starts catabolism (destroying muscle tissue). Ever kg of muscle you lose reduces your basal metabolic rate, and so if you go on a really restrictive diet you will find that you can't go back up to what was previously your maintenance level without gaining weight again.<p>Yes, you need to keep to A diet for the rest of your life to avoid adding weight back, but if you cut reasonably low amounts of calories of your maintenance level you will be able to go back to a much higher level when you've reached your target weight than if you cut a high amount of calories to get your weight loss.",1235741077

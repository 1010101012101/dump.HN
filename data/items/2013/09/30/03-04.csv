It&#x27;s unfortunate but true that women are discouraged from pursuing technical and scientific careers from elementary school on, and once we get into this industry we are dismissed as &#x27;not a good cultural fit&#x27; if we aren&#x27;t interested in halo marathons and competitive cycling. My solution, taken from my consulting background, has been to send out &#x27;contact reports&#x27; after meetings summarizing what was discussed and agreed on and making note of who is responsible for what - a paper trail is a wonderful thing, especially when you cc key stakeholders (eg marketing) who weren&#x27;t in attendance. I also had to learn to take more responsibility for my own development and tell my managers that I wanted to take on new challenges and what specific responsibilities I wanted to have. I also am very assertive about scheduling 1:1 time with senior leaders to check and see what problems they need to solve, telling them how I can help and following through. And when all that seems like it&#x27;s going nowhere, I have a &#x27;lean in circle&#x27; of other professional women once a month for peer coaching. Good luck to both of you!",1380513366

Alternatively, it could have a cel connection (like whispernet for a Kindle), and any time it picks up a frequency it could send out its GPS coordinates or triangulates itself.<p>Either way, technology is the solution, not registering your bicycle.

There seems to be a few problems with it, and I don&#x27;t get the sense that it is a particurly heavily studied problem in the physics community (compared to something like general relativity or QFT).<p>For one thing, nobody is certain that &quot;actual&quot; black holes exist.  What I mean by this is a black hole where matter has actually fallen <i>into</i> it.  Instead, the matter approaches the event horizon at an increasingly slower pace for an observer until at some point in time it is effectively frozen an infinitesimal distance from the event horizon (but still not <i>in</i> the black hole).  In this sense, of course the information content is proportional to the surface area of the black hole.<p>(I should note that mathematically, &quot;effective&quot; black holes and &quot;real&quot; black holes end up having the same properties and behavior; they&#x27;d be indistinguishable to an observer).<p>Another problem with the Bekenstein Bound is that quantum states aren&#x27;t localized to a volume of space.  You can&#x27;t just hold up a beach ball and say &quot;What&#x27;s the maximum information content of this beach ball?&quot;.  Why?  Because you can&#x27;t just have a wavefunction of <i>just</i> &quot;the beachball&quot;.  It&#x27;s a pretty good approximation, but what about the electron-electron correlations at the edge of the beach ball?  And what if the spin of an electron within the beach ball is entangled with an electron outside of it?  The information describing that particular quantum state is then delocalized.",1380512394

My employer had looked at my contract and found that he:\n- had to give me a months notice;\n- had to pay me my severance (a month&#x27;s wage);\n- owed me my un-used leave;\n- already revoked all my access to all internal/external processes.<p>That last one meant that I didn&#x27;t have to come back in again.<p>The other employers that were made redundant, were told they had the choice of leaving that day (and get paid for a month), or finishing the month of work, all receiving their severance normally.<p>My bet, is that it was the first time he ever had to make someone redundant.

Net energy on storage will <i>always</i> be less than the input, but so long as it&#x27;s <i>either</i> net positive <i>or</i> you get some highly useful form of energy out (food, liquid fuels, chemical feedstocks), it&#x27;s worthwhile.<p><i>storage density issues</i>  I said &quot;some&quot;.  Compressed / liquified H2 is viable for some uses.  Including flight.  Remember, the alternative isn&#x27;t existing fossil-fueled heavier-than-air craft, but airships and other &quot;unconventional&quot; fuels.<p><i>Aircraft fuels are being addressed by biofuels</i><p>If there were <i>any</i> level of success from these efforts I&#x27;d expect them to be touted to the stars.  Pretty much every pilot project I&#x27;ve heard of (one big one in the US Midwest over the past year or so) has been exceptionally quiet/muted.  The costs are going to be <i>very</i> high, and I&#x27;m expecting roughly $1000/bbl, translating likely to $50/gallon fuel.  At 40 passenger miles to the gallon, a transcontinental (3000 mile) flight would run you $3750 in fuel charges alone.<p>Conventional freight rail &quot;moves 1 ton of goods 100 miles on 1 gallon of gasoline&quot;.  Assuming 180# per person, that&#x27;s about 1100 miles per person per gallon, or 2.7 gallons for a transcontinental trip ($135 in fuel costs at $50/gallon).  I&#x27;d expect that passenger rail achieves only a fraction of the efficiency of freight (lower packing densities, more stops, etc.).  Turns out it&#x27;s quite a bit less according to methodology applied to Amtrak.  Roughly 55 passenger miles/gallon, a high of 80 pmg during WWII given higher utilization rates:\n<a href=""http://www.railway-technical.com/US-fuel-paper.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.railway-technical.com/US-fuel-paper.shtml</a><p>This could likely be improved by reducing amenity cars (lounge, dining, observation).  And it&#x27;s frankly not much better than a personal automobile with 2 or more occupants.<p>However:  trains offer one significant advantage over aircraft.  They can be electrically powered.  Which frees them from dependence on (increasingly rare and expensive) liquid fuels.  With conventional (<80mph), &quot;higher speed&quot; (<125 mph), or &quot;high speed&quot; rail (150 - 220 mph), power consumption is around 50-95 kWh/passenger km (todo: convert to mpg equivalent), with loading factor (how many seats are filled) being a key determinant.  At 350 kph, a non-stop transcontinental trip would be roughly 14 hours (adding in stops and dwell time would increase this, though if kept to a minimum, not by much).  Hardly as convenient as the 5-6 hours presently attainable, but you&#x27;d have more space and amenities, as well as the option to embark and debark directly in city centers.  An overnight service could be feasible:  leave at 6pm, arrive  at 5am (heading west) or 11 am (heading east).

6467558,comment,6466430,6466430,4,0,Steuard,,,"The remarkable thing that this explanation doesn&#x27;t really explore in depth is that the maximum information (~entropy) contained in a region scales according to its boundary <i>area</i> rather than to its volume. That means that &quot;maximum information per unit volume&quot; drops precipitously with size.[1]<p>Just for example, this allows you to calculate an <i>ultimate</i> limit on Moore&#x27;s law of only ~800 years, for any possible computer functioning within the bounds of the observable universe. As sketched below[1], the observable universe can hold only about 10^123 bits of information. Processors currently contain about 10^9 transistors (each of which has to be doing computations with an independent bit of information to be useful), a factor of 10^114 less. If Moore&#x27;s law claims that this number doubles every 2 years, that means it grows by a factor of 10^3 every 20. And 20x(114/3) is about 760 years. (A more detailed calculation carried out in a paper by Krauss and Starkman at <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404510"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404510</a> came up with a limit of about 600 years.) That&#x27;s almost frighteningly soon.<p>[1] As the link says, for a cubic centimeter (cc) of volume, the maximum entropy is about 10^66 bits. But if you consider a cubic meter instead, you find it can hold at most 10^70 bits, which comes out to 10^64 bits per cc! For a cubic kilometer you get 10^76 bits, which is only 10^61 bits per cc. If the solar system has radius ~10^13 m, it could hold at most 10^96 bits, or 10^51 bits/cc. And the whole observable universe (with radius ~5x10^26 m) could hold at most 2.5x10^123 bits, or 10^38 bits/cc. That&#x27;s remarkably less than the direct one cc calculation! This behavior is exceedingly non-intuitive, at least to me.",1380510353

First, my high school was profoundly hypocritical, allowing teachers unfettered access while forcing students to deal with a firewall -- I know this because one of the ways we discovered to defeat the firewall was to give your computer an IP address in the range assigned to the teachers&#x27; computers.  Second, the punishments are neither appropriate nor acceptable in many cases, with suspensions, ludicrous bans on even touching school computers, and other draconian measures being doled out for things such as <i>modifying boot scripts to display a message</i> (my own pride and joy from middle school).<p>Finally, the censorship is not limited, at least not by any definition I would use.  You yourself said that your school&#x27;s firewall blocked a website that had the word &quot;games&quot; in it.  I have seen hackaday.com blocked for having words like &quot;hack&quot; in it.  When I was a kid these firewalls would also block websites that had the word &quot;vagina,&quot; &quot;penis,&quot; &quot;breasts,&quot; &quot;semen,&quot; &quot;nipples,&quot; and so forth appear enough times -- like, say, a medical website.  This article mentions a ban on <i>streaming music</i> and social media.  The blacklist is so long I have to wonder why they do not just switch to a whitelist, or why they even bother with Internet access at all.<p>Even if the censorship were limited, I cannot see how it would be justified.  Suppose only hardcore pornography were blocked -- how is that acceptable?  Would it not be better to punish students caught watching pornography at school by having them write a lengthy essay about the history and politics of pornography (and wouldn&#x27;t the ability access at least one pornography website be necessary?)?  If the goal is <i>education</i> shouldn&#x27;t the focus be on <i>educating</i>, rather than on trying to shield students from the world?  Consider the flip side of this:  as a kid I was once sent to a summer program for programming, and one of the other students was caught installing back orifice on the computers.  His punishment was to explain the software to everyone, along with the ethics of installing it without permission.",1380510147

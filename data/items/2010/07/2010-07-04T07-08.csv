The authors are much better recorded than live, as it were, and the only videos I could find are of very bad visual quality. The book is written so clearly that it requires no further explanation. But, hey, try them--maybe you'll like them.<p>Don't skip exercises. All the meat is in the exercises. I think there's a bunch at the end of Chapter 2 that make you write a lot of verbose code, to teach you stuff that you probably already understand if you've done OOP. The ideas explained in that section have since got more than their fair share of popularity in the mainstream. Anyway--I skipped those. But many others I thought I'd skip, only to come back to them later and wish I'd done them the first time.",1278230125

1485333,comment,1484322,1484714,0,0,jquery,,,"> I guess to me, tax rates are really low on the list of concerns. If someone's agitating over free speech, over unreasonable searches and seizures, etc., then I'll support them, but whether taxes are 5 or 10% this way or the other way just doesn't seem to be that big an issue to me. It's not a totally unimportant issue, but I wouldn't put it in my top-20.<p>I take tax-rates much more seriously. Taxes are a direct line to slavery--obviously a 100% tax rate would be complete slavery. My current 1/3 tax rate makes me 1/3 slave--maybe a fair trade for being 2/3 free, but a trade nonetheless. Unfortunately, as you succinctly pointed out, tax rates of late have had little relation to spending, but in the long-term input = output, so as a young individual I see taxes and spending as two sides of the same coin.<p>To the extent our government has shown restraint, I think that is due to people making their concerns known and visible, as well as some good old fashioned American luck. Politicians will tend to acquire as much power as the people let them.",1278229489
1485332,comment,1483714,1483714,0,0,duckpunch,,,"You should be careful in thinking that you have to choose. In fact, regardless of what you do with .NET, I think it's a good idea to learn about the *nix environment and some languages that you're not yet comfortable developing in.<p>In my program at school I see a ton of students leaving university knowing nothing but one to three statically typed OO languages, and assuming that those paint an accurate picture of the full range of programming languages.<p>I'm not saying this is you, but if you're not comfortable outside of C#, Java, C/C++ etc. you're limiting yourself. Programming languages may be difficult to master, but you can glean a surprising number of lessons from one language by spending a few weeks with it. I think a few languages a year isn't asking for too much, and whether you use them or not, the lessons will transfer to the language you spend most of your time in.<p>If all of your programming experience involves using IDEs, do yourself a favor and spend extensive time in a powerful text editor like vim or emacs. While these editors might not have the advanced features present in IDEs, making the trade in favor of a more powerful programming language used in concert with a less powerful editor may actually make you more effective. The point is that you can't discern between the two until you've spent ample time in both. Being uncomfortable outside of an IDE can be a serious crutch as it keeps you using languages that the IDE can take full advantage of, and this excludes a number of languages that you should expose yourself to.<p>Nosql is an orthogonal issue. While relational databases are unlikely to ever go away, if nosql databases continue seeing success, there's no reason to think that seasoned .NET folks won't also make use of them.",1278229385

I am a native speaker of Hebrew, so the roots are similar, which made it not very hard.<p>It used a novel alphabet (likely the first ever) that was a phonetic abjad (no vowels) derived from Akkadian cuneiform (in turn derived from Sumerian cuneiform).<p>As far as ""few tablets"" goes, I happen to have used VERY thick books full of transcriptions of Ugaritic tablets. One of the advantages of knowledge about Ugarit (the city) being lost is that until the recent rediscovery of its ruins it lay mostly undisturbed.<p>So, if we discover another language with close genetic ties to a known tongue and an alphabet that's different but similar, we'll have just the thing :) Of course, this is better than what we had before, my jest doesn't mean to detract!<p>Onwards with Linear A :>",1278229372

Many good apps have arrived, but the number is nowhere near the appstore, yet.<p>Here's the kicker, though: This will inevitably change. It <i>is</i> already changing. When you compare the android market today versus a few months ago then you'll notice quite a number of high-profile apps have appeared.<p>As a developer you can't ignore android anymore. You're not building an iPhone app nowadays, you're building an iPhone app <i>and</i> an android app.<p>And it won't be long before the priorities reverse.<p>Once android devices outnumber iPhones by 10:1 the question will be whether you build an iPhone app along with your Android app - not the other way round.<p>Remember Apple is at its absolute peak today. There's nowhere to go from here in terms of features or polish.<p>Sure, they can add voice recognition, brush up the hardware even more and perhaps they'll even find another killer-feature or two to add. But HTC and Google are breathing in their neck now, the gap in user experience is closing. From there the primary differentiating factor becomes price.

1485317,comment,1483583,1483986,0,0,seancron,,,"Theravada Buddhism, and The Buddha's teachings actually stress that Buddhism is not nihilism or asceticism[1], and it not about materialism. Instead, Buddhism takes the Middle Path and does not encourage either extreme. Buddhism at its core is about realizing the transience of life. It is about realizing how we are all interconnected and how our reality is formed through our interactions with the world. We suffer because we are overly attached to transient objects and ideas. To be free of this suffering, we must realize the ultimate reality and nature of our world.  We must fully let go of our attachments, and instead immerse ourselves in the reality that is now.  The transient reality that we and others have created. The reality that is constantly shifting and constantly evolving.<p>[1] Much has been written about emptiness and nothingness in Buddhism, with one prominent example being Nagarjuna, whose argument was in summary: if you cannot be empty of an individual self, then that means you have an individual self. If you have an individual self, you exist regardless of causes. If you exist regardless of causes, then you affect anything since everything changes you in some way. Therefore, you are empty of any individual self, and instead only have a <i>causal</i> self.",1278228468

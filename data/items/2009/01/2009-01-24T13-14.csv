448087,comment,447694,447694,0,0,marvin,,,"This is a very interesting question.. In our world, it doesn't really have any practical consequences. Making a Turing complete language is trivial, you only need increment/decrement, zero and a jump instruction. These things are available on just about any platform.<p>Given infinite memory (which in practice means an infinite number of states), any particular Turing machine computation can be performed by a specifically constructed pushdown automation or even a finite-state machine. The distinction between the capabilities of Turing machines and less general machines is in what types of computation <i>one particular machine description</i> can perform. There is a particular Turing machine that can simulate any Turing machine (taking a machine description and input for this machine as input), so obviously any Turing computation can be performed by this particular machine.<p>It would probably be really difficult to program an FSM or a PDA to perform ""general"" computations, but it would be an interesting intellectual exercise. Try making a programming language (with LISP macros, maybe?) that will let you easily describe a finite-state machine to solve a particular computational problem. Given an infinite amount of code and memory, you could do everything a Turing machine could do.<p>It's like the recent discussion around the halting problem: how much of a problem is it really in the practical world? You can always design a mathematical contradiction around the <i>general</i> case, but for any particular problem it is possible to describe a solution that works. The difference is that any practical benefit of using a language that is not Turing complete is hid very well.",1232805128

448082,comment,447435,447820,0,0,dmm,,,"Plan 9 admittedly sucks in many ways. It has limited hardware support,
a weird user interface, and no active community. But also has
redeeming qualities that I miss every day that I have to program on
linux.<p>In Plan 9 every process has a namespace associated with it that
represents all the resources it has access to. For example, /dev/mouse
represents the mouse in Plan 9. But typically it isn't provided by the
kernel but by the window manager, rio. So when you open rio it opens
the mouse and then provides a new /dev/mouse for each process launched
within it. Every process has a different /dev/mouse that only
activates when the mouse is in that process's window(if it has one).<p>To draw to the screen there is one function: draw(). You pass it two
rasters and some coordinates and it draws one on top of the
other. That's it. Everything works across networks and architectures.<p>The thread library is wonderful. Threads in Plan 9 are non-preemptive
and run in a round-robin fashion. They communicate using CSP
channels. CSP can greatly simplify the design of many programs.<p>In a few of the programs I wrote would access the mouse and keyboard
in seperate threads. You could use the regular open() and read() calls
from each thread and there was no need to worry about locks. When I
wanted something to run on both cpus I forked a process, which is very
cheap.<p>The text editor, acme, is different and probably sucked for you. But
that is because you misunderstood what it was. In linux and windows
programs are islands. These islands are expected to provide everything
the program does in one executable. Acme is not an island. It does not
have a builtin spell checker or word counter. What it does have is a
namespace that allows you to access its resources.<p>Plan 9 is a system which was deliberately made by very smart
people. It has serious issues which make it not often a realistic
choice, but it has a clarity and consistency of design that linux will
never know.",1232805026

448064,comment,447087,448010,0,0,corentin,,,"> Unless you happen to live in les banlieues.<p>Actually, the banlieues (suburbs) are the most subsidized areas of the country. The infrastructure there (schools, libraries, sport clubs, etc.) has a mysterious tendency to spontaneously consume itself, but usually it's promptly rebuilt thanks to the generous taxpayer.<p>The thing is, those cities were planned and designed from the ground-up by progressive, visionary social engineers as part of a social experiment (in collectivism, it goes without saying) funded with money from the Marshall plan. And the result of this experiment seems to be that, no, people really don't like living in cities that look like Brasilia.<p>But that's just one part of the problem. The big picture is gloomier and it reveals a massive failure of the French socialist-minded government in economic and social policies. The most rigid labour laws in the world prevent employers from hiring anyone but the most productive and qualified workers. Everyone else (too old, too young, not qualified enough, etc.) is excluded from the job market and lives on welfare.<p>The social policies are probably even worse than the economic policies. They say racism is evil and we should all live together and love each other and so on, yet they don't seem to really believe in what they preach since they have this nasty habit of forcing people to integrate; which, of course, only results in more racism, hatred and violence.<p>Oh, I forgot about justice. It's very humane. After all, criminals are themselves victims of society and should be treated as such, aren't they?<p>You're right about the word time-bomb, but it's far from being as simple as a clash between two classes. The government has generated hundreds of antagonist interest groups. The CRS is extremely efficient at dealing with random bursts of violence (it's one of the most efficient European police force when it comes to dealing with urban violence). But of course it can't prevent or control a civil war.",1232802344

However, that study doesn't provide information about how much of that 45% is disabled, and how many are elderly, two more groups disproportionately predisposed towards poverty.<p>If you're being downvoted, it's because you keep bringing up a very straight-forward study and drawing a very extreme social conclusion from it.",1295675986

They are great at tracking and processing data, but I don't think they are good at intersecting what that data means with the human priorities behind the data. In other words, they can tell if A > B for existing work, but they don't seem to do very good at telling whether C will be better than A, instead choosing to shotgun and hope enough stuff sticks.<p>Good product management (which early founders must do) is about determining what data to gather by figuring out why the data is important to the future of the product.  It costs money/time to gather and analyze data, so knowing you are gathering the right data is important. In the process, you hope to be able to answer whether C will be greater than A.",1295675366

I did not know that python 3.1 was that much slower than python 2.x (python 3.0 was, but this was well known from everyone).<p>His point about writing new python 2 code for easy 2to3 application is a good one: porting existing projects to python 3 is quite difficult, because it cannot always be done without breaking API, but writing new code which can be easily ported is much easier. There still needs better support to easily use 2to3 and test its output in an automated fashion.<p>I am also delighted to see known python hackers to recognize the lack of python 3 usage, and that maybe the roadmap needs to be somehow modified.",1295673475

The same way how biologists need to go out into nature to find new species and learn from interesting animal behaviors.<p>For example, if I were to apply to become a pizza delivery man, I'll find ways to simplify and optimize the traditional delivery process. Then when I open my own pizza store, I'll have the most efficient pizza delivery system, maybe this will be the killer service that will bring down Dominos and Pizza Hut.<p>So if you see a pizza delivery dude next time, maybe it'll be me... ;-)",1295672952

If it sticks, it will have the effect of making patent suits against competitors seem more dubious, which would in turn prepare people for more exacting versions.<p>How far ultimately would you want to push it?  I honestly don't know yet.  Patents may have some utility.  It's a very complicated question.  I've read a lot about the history of technology, and I can't say for sure whether things would have gone better or worse without patents.  The topic seems to be one of those where on average the strength of people's opinions is inversely proportional to how much they've studied the problem.",1314823292

2947391,comment,2945513,2946777,1,0,smokinn,,,"In an event-based system, especially a large distributed one, ROLLBACK as a single command to revoke all previous attempts at state mutation becomes impossible to support. Instead of supporting distributed transactions you have to change to a tentative model. The paper Life beyond Distributed Transactions: an Apostate's Opinion (Available here: <a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs223/papers/cidr07p15.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs223/papers/cidr07p15.pdf</a> ) describes this well.<p>Basically instead of making a transaction between 2 entities, you send a message to the first reserving some data, a message to the second reserving the data and once you get confirmation from both (or however many entities are involved in the transaction) you send a commit to them.<p>These reservations can be revoked though. Your rollback has to be managed by an ""activity"".<p>Ex: Bank transfers. You have the activity called BankTransfer. It manages the communication between entities and the overall workflow. It starts by sending messages to entities Account#1 with 100$ in it and Account#2 also with 100$. To #1 it says debit 500$. To #2 it says credit 500$. #2 responds first and says Done. #1 responds second and says Insufficient Funds. BankTransfer sends another message to #2 saying Cancel event id 100 (the crediting).<p>Other activities that want to read the state of number 1 will see 100$ in it but the transfer (as yet unconfirmed) had been of 50 rather than 500$ and another debit of 75$ comes in it would respond insufficient funds. At this point it's the activity's job to decide what to do. Wait and try again? Fail entirely and notify any other entities relevant to the workflow? That's up to the business rules. Also, since the credit has not yet been confirmed, reading the balance on #2 would still say 100, not 600$.<p>Of course, depending on your use case you may want the read to return the balance with unconfirmed transactions. That's entirely up to the application code and business rules but the example should be explanatory as to how rollback is implemented.<p>Eventual consistency is the only scalable way to go for very large systems.",1314822144

But on reflection, I believe I understand the motivation here.<p>Big companies that use patents as a revenue stream (MSFT, IBM, etc.) typically bide their time and bring a patent lawsuit once a new company is established and there is blood to drain.  It's the threat of such a lawsuit in the future that can negatively impact investment in a startup, as the right collection of patents could conceivably capture much of the economic surplus of a new venture.  Alternatively, a big company might use the threat of a patent lawsuit, now or in the future, to push a young company to agree to an early acquisition.<p>The pledge doesn't seem to have much impact on these scenarios, even if a big company were to follow it rigorously.<p>Most of us, I believe, would prefer to see companies make a stronger commitment: ""No first use of software patents"" [period].  Google hasn't made this pledge, but to the best of my knowledge, they've acted in this way so far.  It does seem in line with ""don't be evil.""<p>That said, I think I see what PG is going for here.  He wants companies to make a pledge that, at a minimum, allows a new product or service to be tested on the market.  That way, if it gathers traction, it will attract investment despite the threat of patents, and the new company will be able to mount a reasonable defense.<p>Perhaps more importantly, though, by allowing the product to succeed first, even in a modest way, it makes the offensive use of patents worse PR for the big company.  Killing a successful product with patents is no longer an abstract issue.  It takes away from customers and the market something very real.",1314821872

Have everyone declare the value of their intellectual ""property"" (patents, copyrights, trademarks) - each and every item, for that year, on their tax return, and have them pay 1% of the value as ""IP tax"", per year.<p>Clarification: you can set a different value every year. The value may drop to zero because a competitor's patent solves the problem better; or it may go up because it becomes essential to something that becomes commonplace.<p>That amount is what one pays for a compulsory license or if successfully sued, and up to 3 times that for willful infringement, per year -- and no more. (But of course, a patent owner can always negotiate a lower payment, as is done with music recordings that have compulsory license agreements)<p>All of a sudden, everyone has an incentive to state a reasonable value for their patent. Copyright catalogs that are not being published (old music recordings, old books, old movies) would be assigned 0 value by copyright holder, to avoid tax - which means anyone can freely make a copy. If they believe -- at the end of the year -- that someone is making a profit at their expense, they can set the value as high as they want at the end of that year, pay the tax, and sue the profiteer.<p>Simple, elegant, and coffer filling.<p>edit: put missing link<p>edit: added clarification about setting value each year anew.",1314821600

They didn't abandon it or anything.<p>The thing which bugged me the most about Vista was that it was slower than XP. Significantly. And for no apparently good reason. From a user perspective, it did mostly the same stuff, but required so much more resources in terms of CPU, RAM, and GPU. Going from Win 98SE to XP wasn't like that at all. XP did need more RAM, but it ran faster and was less buggy. Apps and games ran on it fine.<p>IT shops I worked at avoided Vista like the plague, and so did many businesses. The general consensus was that it was slow, something I and many fellow IT workers experienced whenever we used it. All of us waited for SP1, and when it came and did really nothing, everyone basically went ""Well, XP until Windows 7 comes out!"".<p>Plus its UI was annoying. ""You just told me to do something. Are you sure you want me to do what you just told me to?"" YES/NO dialog boxes everywhere. Great for someone whose never used a PC before. Terrible for anyone who has more than a year's experience. UAC was a mess. Yes, you could fix most of that by tweaking the OS, but there was no way to get your settings to easily follow you around PC-to-PC outside of roaming profiles via Active Directory. The default out-of-the-box experience was terrible compared to XP.<p>Microsoft never issued a patch to fix any of that. They can't; once they ship an OS they sign an unwritten agreement with IT shops and developers saying ""this is the standard until Windows 7 comes out"". That's a good stance to take sometimes, but not if your root standard is terrible.<p>The OS should have been delayed another year before release to make it good, but they didn't do that.

If it's complex enough, and someone else did it first, there's no reason why it shouldn't be patentable the same as any other invention.<p>The problem as I see it, is that people are granting patents for nonsense.

It's not the system's fault.  The system already has rules in place to prevent that.

The most complicated is just to have mirrored servers and only restart the one not in use right now.<p>> I'm talking about having more data than fits in an reasonable amount of RAM (say 1TB).<p>For something where you need transactions across all of that? This architecture's probably not a reasonable approach, then. The basic precondition is that everything fits in RAM. However, sharding is certainly possible if you can break your data into domains across which you don't require consistent transactions.<p>> So it's going to at the speed of the disk.<p>Sort of.<p>Because it's just writing to a log, mutations go at the speed of streaming writes, which is very fast on modern disks.

It's pretty much impossible to make any bearing as to the professionalism or otherwise of the ""detective"" (it says earlier in the same para that it was ""officers"" operating under a warrant, which would almost certainly not be detectives for recovering a stolen laptop, YMMV the piece looks unfinished and unedited to me).<p>However, FWIW, saying something is disgusting isn't casting a moral judgement on it. If you show me a festering sore I might remark ""urgh, that's disgusting"" but I don't find sores to be immoral. I'm pretty sure he or she wasn't presenting or even attempting to present a legal judgement with what was most likely an off-the-cuff remark. Unprofessional, perhaps mildly.<p>For all we know the remark was disgust at a teacher having apparently knowingly handled stolen goods taken from another school and encouraged a pupil into delinquency by helping them profit from crime and that the plaintiff misinterpreted. Yes it would probably still be mildly unprofessional to comment.<p>Aside, aren't school laptops marked to show their owner; this would have made it near impossible to not know that the goods were stolen.",1314820873

Could this lead to an even bigger penalty if the company is made aware that they are infringing when they are small and doesn't act on it when they grow, thus willfully infringing?",1314820856

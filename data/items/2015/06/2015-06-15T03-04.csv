9717450,comment,9717170,9717360,0,0,mc32,,,"Yeah, it&#x27;s become so pervasive that it&#x27;s not out of the ordinary for American reporters to say &#x27;Mehiko&quot; instead of Mexico while speaking an otherwise English sentence.  Or they try to pronounce the surname Velazquez in Spanish, but when it comes to Van Gogh or 習近平, there is no attempt at native pronunciation.  This kind of inconsistency is baffling --moreover their Spanish pronunciation is not Castillian even when the person is Spanish.  So they are all over the map.<p>I&#x27;ve been down to Mexico and I&#x27;m quite sure people don&#x27;t try to pronounce &#x27;Nueva York&#x27; as &#x27;New York&#x27;.<p>On the other hand, these same reporters mangle Chinese city names with abandon, so it&#x27;s not as if they&#x27;re just trying to say the names in a native fashion --which I guess at least would make some consistent sense.",1434340728

I find this behavior somewhat surprising.

But Einstein&#x27;s genius was to boil things down to two laws (within an inertial reference frame, typical laws of motion hold, and the speed of light is the same in all reference frames). From <i>there</i> we moved from simple calculations that we already knew how to do to a much deeper understanding of the subject.

Over the years, I&#x27;ve acquired a fair number of skills that I&#x27;d like to apply.<p>I have a couple of personal projects I&#x27;ve worked on, such as an android app (java) for a non-profit that has an accompanying backend in django (python). I&#x27;ve another C++ project that is a key value store with a REST API. There&#x27;s also my reddit AMA FAQ creation software. That one&#x27;s done in python. It vectorizes questions and clusters them based on the resulting representation; the result is that similar questions get grouped together so more people can get answers to their questions.<p>I&#x27;m also open to non-conventional software jobs, like sustaining, or anything you have in mind.",1434338172

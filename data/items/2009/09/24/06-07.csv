840730,comment,840523,840627,0,0,mkramlich,,,"I disagree with your statement that a codebase without tests cannot safely be refactored.<p>I've been refactoring code for 20+ years, the overwhelming majority of time without any automated tests, and I'd say offhand 99% of the time it causes no bugs, and in the occasional case where it does cause a bug (because I am imperfect and sometimes make mistakes), I almost always soon find it during the same coding session and fix it.<p>The key is to understand the code well enough to know what effects what and how. Hold that model in your mind and you're golden. Lots of time saved not writing tests, updating them, fixing them when they break, etc.<p>Note that this is not an argument against tests in general, just an argument for there being cases where you don't miss them and they would be a net loss if you had them due to all the extra make-work required. I think there's a lot of kool-aid drinking going on among people who themselves probably lacked the ability to do ""naked"" refactors well. To those folks I say, ""Great, have fun storming the castle!"" but don't assume that other folks who haven't drunk your kool-aid are constantly banging their head on the wall breaking the code or living in fear of mysterious hypothetical bugs due to a lack of tests. A really excellent 'old fashioned' sort of test is to just run the fricking code -- did it work? did it do what it was supposed to do? data look good? k, move on to the next one of the thousands of other problems you have to solve and tasks you have to do in life. And use version control, so if you retroactively do discover a problem, you can review the diffs, or rollback, or do a tactical patch against the branch, etc.<p>I do agree with your statement, ""By all means, ship. Do what  you gotta do."" And I agree that that attitude may cause you to at least temporarily incur technical debt, and you generally want to pay that down as soon as feasible.

Shouldn't this be a window manager feature?<p>Consider the similarities.  A tab overlaps other tabs, as windows do.  It has a title.  It can be moved.  It can be created and closed.<p>Sure, tabs have a few ""expected"" differences from windows: the tabs in a stack all move together, and when resized they stay in sync.  But this is already behavior that window managers are capable of (e.g. Mac OS X drawers can resize a drawer in sync with its parent window).<p>The devil is in all the <i>other</i> ""differences"" tabs have from windows, that are really just silly.  For one, every application seems to have ""redundant"" commands to satisfy their tabs, such as ""New Tab"" and ""Close Tab"".  All the nice keyboard short-cuts, such as rotating between windows, are either broken or unpredictable for tabs in each application.  You can't necessarily minimize/hide tabs.  On Mac OS X, a window-modal sheet blocks all tabs for no reason, when it could block just one tab ""window"".<p>As far as programming, all kinds of extra work is required to make tabs do the trivial things that are automatic with regular windows: for instance, on Windows, tabs do not have miniaturized previews unless the app goes to great effort; and on the Mac, Exposé can't split out all of a window's tabs.<p>There's one final problem with this ""design decision"" for tabs: it's impossible to tab-stack arbitrary things.  What if I want a tab stack with 2 web browsers, an E-mail message and a text editor?  I <i>can't</i>, because tabs are inherently app-specific.<p>As programmers and OS designers, it's time to step back and fix this, isn't it?  A tab fundamentally <i>is</i> a window.  It's a wheel being constantly reinvented.  Technically, all you need is a gizmo in the window manager to turn any window into a tab, at which point any other window can be dragged onto the window to ""stack"" more tabs into it (or dragged out, to recreate normal windows).  This behavior seems so clearly in the window manager's domain, that it's hard to imagine why an application would <i>even need to know</i> when one of its windows is technically a tab.",1253772397

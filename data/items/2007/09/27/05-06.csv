60175,comment,59894,59894,0,0,zach,,,"So basically, neither the founders nor the angels are sufficiently bold or well-connected to find a deal without going through some kind of rigid organizational structure.  Sounds like a sure-fire winner!<p>But seriously, these kinds of organizations seem like a nice place to learn, network and meet angels... for the members.  The startup founders of the world would be better off creating their own organization, that is if they ever do find the time...",1190872208

So no need to write an assertion for that special case. By blow up I meant do something bad, not fail in a noisy way. That would be the exception.",1190872206
60173,comment,60109,60109,0,0,staunch,,,"I've known more than a few 20-somethings who charge over $100/hour and a couple that are around the $200/hr mark. There's no correlation between expertise and hourly rate in my experience. Some of them are ripping people off and some are undercharging.<p>The reason this works is that person writing the check is usually not spending their own money, or if they are it's a drop in the bucket for them and $5k or $15k isn't much of a difference. They've probably already wasted $100k+ in salary over time having their employees try to handle the same task before deciding to bring in someone new. The other factor is the (mistaken) thinking that if you charge a lot you must be worth a lot.<p>At most companies the idea of giving one of their own programmers a $20k cash bonus to do a 10 week project in 1 week is out of the question, but paying a consultant to do the same thing is no big deal.<p>The Expensive Consultant idea is what IBM basically lives off of these days. In their case I think it's pretty unethical, but for individuals who are truly qualified it's a win-win situation and I highly recommend it as well.\n",1190872123
60172,comment,60128,60128,0,0,staunch,,,"I think the solution is to get the idea guy down in the details of each idea. Bring him along for the ride and let him come up with lots of micro-ideas. It can be very useful to have two people thinking about the minute details, especially if they balance each other. Involve him in the thousand tiny decisions you have to make while implementing an idea.<p>Get him to stop looking at competitors. It's nerve wracking, demoralizing, and distracting. You guys probably have more than enough ideas by now, if you'd just focus on the most promising ones your competitors might start looking at you.",1190870426

I had not revealed its existence to any of my coworkers, but as you will notice, none of the other posts are particularly charged as regards business or business politics.<p>I do want to be open and honest with my coworkers, and I've already had one (one of the designers) have a look at what I wrote. I am going to present the ideas contained therein, to the group, ASAP--it's a matter of finding time to meet and talk about ""serious stuff"". I was hoping to get some feedback from YC readers because I trust their opinion and ability to perceive when someone has gone off the deep end as regards ideas, reasoning, etc. In other words, I'm hoping that if I'm smoking crack, or if all startups are this way, someone will tell me before I unveil it to my coworkers at large.<p>I am certainly not trying to get at my coworkers. The stuff at the top is in case it's discovered by a certain coworker who i would <i>rather</i> heard it from me, not the blog. He's been known to read YC news once in a while, thus the precaution.",1190869757

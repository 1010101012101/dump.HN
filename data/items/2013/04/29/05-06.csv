Either you expect the people being interviewed as part of their prep to learn and remember forever everything they ever may need at Facebook and that could possibly be asked in the interview, or your argument doesn't make sense. If I hadn't any contact with parsers/compilers for a while I will need to look stuff up. When you have no frame of reference in my process when getting the information necessary to solve the problem - how can that possibly be a good indicator of me being able to solve an unforeseen problem? If there is a known solution and I already have the exact algorithm, the hard part is over and it's only about writing code. Which is exactly what people seem to complain here: The skill to reproduce a known algorithm is at best the lowest possible bar.",1367215193

If the list of all American novelists is too long, it can always be broken down by the initial letters of their last names.<p>Not to mention that some first names can be either male or female and that the genders of foreign names may be hard to figure out if you've never heard them before (there are plenty of American novelists whose families came from elsewhere).

5624334,comment,5623663,5624228,2,0,bbillings,,,"So we do lock-downs still, but it's not about working crazy hours, it's about focus.  Under lock-down you are allowed to push the other stuff to the side for awhile.  For instance I typically do 2-3 interviews a week, help with training new interviewers, etc.  This can easily be 5-6 hours of total time out of my week.  This is part of being an engineer at Facebook.  Onboarding sessions, new engineer mentoring, etc.  This is all part of normal workdays, unless you are in a lock-down, then you focus on getting whatever it is you need to get done done and not worry about the rest for awhile.<p>I personally disagree pretty heavily on sleeping in the office and working crazy hours.  I find it very counter productive and generally think it leads to bad decisions, bad code, and ultimately bad products.  It is certainly the exception, and not something you should be doing if you aren't 22 years old and/or more than a little crazy.  I personally haven't worked crazy hours at Facebook since probably 2009.<p>Talking about this sort of thing from a PR perspective seems has to balance getting people excited about our environment and explaining our goals and day-to-day.  I've found it's something the media outlets love to play up.  The normal day-in-the-life of an engineer is fun, but chill, and not particularly news worthy.",1367214938

I can understand that sometimes the NDAs weave all the way down to the silicon manufacturers though, so it can be like pulling teeth to get anywhere at times.<p>Notably, Google and Apple are both in good positions to promote control-in-ownership, if not FOSS, but only Google has taken that stance.<p>Even without drivers, if hardware manufacturers were serious about delivering control with the hardware, they would prioritize providing as much of the same documentation they would have needed for internal development as possible, along with the device, to speed up community efforts to support hardware they may not be able to support themselves.<p>I can understand it if their hands are tied (they could say if so, for example), but I consider the the HTC and Samsung (and Archos) bootloaders half-hearted. They are selling Android devices, and the early Android community was very excited about the prospect of a Linux phone (like they are about an Ubuntu phone or a Firefox phone, and were about the Neo Freerunner).

Meanwhile, the $3 microcontroller I buy that runs as 12mhz fits every requirement I have while being manufactured at a cheaper, but much larger process. The high end processors and FPGAs however, benefit much more from smaller feature sizes (and those FPGAs cost accordingly).<p>As far as I know, when these 4 companies make advancements, the entire industry benefits. For example, Nikon comes out with a more advanced stepper for 14nm processes, Intel is the one paying the premium for them, and later the rest of the industry can benefit from a more reliable 65/45/32nm process after the cutting edge companies have moved on. I believe this is true for the EDA tool space as well.<p>The last paragraph is a bit of speculation on my part. I'm not in the semiconductor field but I know a bit about it, and logically it makes sense for tools / equipment. It does not include things like internal knowledge about manufacturing reliably on a certain process however.",1367213921
5624273,comment,5623672,5624232,12,0,skrebbel,,,"First of all, there is. There's people making Linux demos. There's plenty cross-platform demos, too. Search <a href=""http://www.pouet.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pouet.net</a> for Linux demos.<p>However, indeed it's pretty thin compared to Windows demos. There's a bunch of reasons, but I believe that there are three big ones:<p>1. Linux, until fairly recently, required a significant amount of tinkering and tweaking config files before you could even use it decently, let alone code graphics on it. This does not match the average demoscener's mindset; most demosceners want to get stuff on the screen, now. A side-effect of this attitude, by the way, is really shitty code, which in turn has contributed to the small amount of open source demos out there (people are ashamed of the pile of dirt that's under the hood).<p>2. For most of the nineties and early zeroes, Windows was obviously the strongest platform for 3D graphics. All the graphics hardware <i>just worked</i>, you could choose between OpenGL and DirectX and typically both had decent drivers. You could say that that's unfair because the hardware vendors supported Windows, and Linux drivers were often homecooked by the community, but that's beside the point: Stuff. On the screen. Now.<p>3. Audience. You could give a Windows demo to your gamer friend and he could see it. Of course, you couldn't give the Windows demo to that classmate who only ran Linux, but you'd prefer not to get into a discussion with him anyway because It'd always turn into a rant about licenses and freedom. Or, well, that's how the common perception of ""the average Linux user"" was among much of the demoscene.<p>Nowadays, many active demosceners are game programmers by day, and Windows still is the strongest game dev platform. These people are used to Windows gamedev tools and switching for the evening hobby just sounds too much of a hassle.",1367213897

I did not receive an offer on both occasions, but I'll try to remain unbiased. I did receive an offer from Google and Quora, if it helps.<p>Facebook's interview process seems to have a very high variance in terms of candidates' experiences about the process. In the telephone rounds, collabedit often has sync issues, which can be quite stressful for first timers. Occasionally, interviewers either do not speak clearly, keep moving away from the speakerphone or have a very difficult to understand accent (not sure how to solve this one). These two things compounded together have caused several people I know to have a terrible experience in the first round, and it appears that these issues are not taken into consideration when making a final decision, as was the case for me. I had two phone interviews because the first one had these issues. I was called to the campus for the final interviews, which I would certainly describe as ""code problems"", or more accurately as algorithm based problems. I actually found these interviews to be easier than the phone rounds, which was a common opinion among the other candidates I met. I was quite surprised to not get an offer and my guess is that the botched phone round had an effect, but I may be wrong.<p>This is intended as honest feedback rather than a sour grapes reaction to not being extended an offer. I have interviewed with several other companies and usually the experience is either consistently good or consistently bad, which at least gives the candidates a fair playing field. My guess would be that this feedback is getting ignored because it primarily comes from rejected candidates.<p>Finally, it would be great if software companies started sharing feedback about candidates' performance if they don't receive an offer instead of a cliched e-mail. Quora seems to be the only one doing this at the moment: <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Quora-Recruiting/Can-I-get-the-feedback-about-how-I-performed-in-an-interview-with-Quora?share=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Quora-Recruiting/Can-I-get-the-feedbac...</a>",1367212298

You might want to think through the logic in some other area of life. Maybe gas prices at the pump, or candy prices at the supermarket counter. Cheaper and better comparable products DO tend to win over time, do they not?<p>If X is 22% cheaper (while being better as well) than Y, the people who buy a LOT of this good, whatever it is, have a HUGE incentive to switch. In the case of health care, the big movers would be (a) health insurance companies, (b) other companies that offer health coverage to their employees.<p>Additionally, of those who buy health coverage or health care directly as individuals there are bound to be some customers who are <i>unusually</i> price sensitive or unusually anal about doing price comparisons. On the margin, THOSE people will switch, and their friends who look to them for guidance will also switch. Just that movement alone might put a company out of business and thereby protect everyone else too, but you also have to think about natural churn. Even if existing customers and existing big companies and existing insurers are all too lazy to switch, as NEW companies and individuals look for their FIRST contract, they'll do a comparison and see that 22% savings.<p>Last but not least, <i>ignorance is somewhat curable</i>. When X is 22% cheaper to provide (while also better) than Y, X can sell the service for less AND have a higher profit margin...and will use some of those profits (or expected profits) to ADVERTISE.

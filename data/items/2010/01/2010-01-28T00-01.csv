The iPhone sells so well precisely because it just works, and it's <i>really</i> hard to screw it up relative to a computer.  How is creating a consumer electronics device evil?  Because people want it to be a computer?  Because it'll somehow erode the market for full-fledged computers?  Because they're attracting developers to their closed system?  How is this any more evil than Nintendo or Sony or Microsoft making their game consoles relatively closed systems?<p>We should all keep in mind that computers as such are a usability and maintenance disaster for 95% of the population who has no idea how to deal with viruses, install or remove software, resolve crashes or incompatibilities, or even navigate a file system so they don't lose their documents.<p>Maybe I'm too cynical about computers and give Apple too much of the benefit of the doubt, but their devices are good precisely because they exert so much end-to-end control, and computers are broken for so many people precisely because they're so open.",1264640190

I feel like to have this opinion, perhaps you have worked mainly on smaller systems? In larger systems, there can be so many possibilities that it would take several times longer to test than to code, and without reading spec docs, it is very difficult to tell what correct even <i>is</i>.  For example, a student loan system I worked on fit this bill.  The glib answer would be to say it was so complex because of poor programming, but that's not true.  The legal reality it was modeling was complex and so the software could not be less complex than the underlying system's rules.  I have worked on several such systems in different industries.<p>Now, you could argue that all programmers should become programming/QA people, but that would be self-defeating as programmer time is generally more expensive per-hour than QA time.  Further, the type of person who is good at running through 400 steps of detail-oriented rote testing is not always the same person that you would like doing high-level design.

The only thing that's missing is the ability to sell ""icons"" on the app store that merely subscribe one to a web app and stick the link on their home screen. This would meld the ease of development and deployment of web apps with the ease of payment processing the app store provides. I don't see this ever happening because Apple couldn't control the ability to review subsequent changes before they were live, but it's a nice dream.",1264637376

It encourages the barefoot running style while protecting your feet from sharp objects.<p><a href=""http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/products_kso_trek_m.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/products_kso_trek_...</a><p>I can attest that there is an adjustment period to strengthen your ankles and calf muscles.  As an experiment it's going well so far.  It totally changed my gait.<p>Barefoot running techniques are becoming very popular.  The recent book _Born to Run_ is partly responsible for this phenomenon.<p>But within the running community, there is not yet a consensus on the barefoot style (or the related Chi Running style), mostly due to the lack of data.  Hopefully this study and others will finally shed some light on comparative injury rates.<p>The basic idea is this: The arch in your foot is quite strong and flexible, and it is all the cushion you really need when running or walking.  Running barefoot forces you to use this natural springiness of your foot by landing on your mid- or fore-foot.  Running in shoes, on the other hand, encourages you to lengthen your stride and land on your heel.  The heel-strike is the source of much injury (plantar fasciitis, knee problems, etc) according to the barefoot advocates.  It's simply impossible to run barefoot and land on your heel-- it hurts too much.<p>In the book _Born to Run_, the author goes to a gait analysis lab.  They compared the impact of him running on a force plate in shoes and while barefoot.  To his surprise, there was less impact while barefoot than while in his Nike running shoes; the theory was the massive heel cushioning takes the edge off an impact that would otherwise cause sharp foot pain but doesn't lessen the total impact on your ankles, shins and knees.<p>There was change in the air at the Zombie Runner store in Palo Alto where I bought the Vibrams last week.  They could barely keep any of these models in stock.  Born to Run was on display <i>in front of the shoe wall</i> as if it were now required reading before buying a shoe.",1264637236

Web apps require knowledge of a ton of software layers, not least of which is the web server/client architecture and protocols. To the extent that native apps are also communicating with remote services there is probably not much difference, but many native apps are built to stand alone which, in my opinion, makes them an order of magnitude easier to develop.",1264637219

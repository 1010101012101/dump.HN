You probably don&#x27;t. You probably don&#x27;t want them to be able to do lots of things. Hence the standard library lacking most things.<p>Yes, having a package manager might solve some issues, but not for any of Lua&#x27;s primary use cases. It&#x27;s not supposed to be the language you write your web app in, or a shell script replacement, or whatever else, and the language developers really don&#x27;t care about those use cases. It&#x27;s not supposed to be anything out of the box aside from some syntax and semantics that are Turing-complete and reasonably usable.<p>Where I&#x27;ve seen Lua used, often even the existing standard library is modified or not used at all due to constraints from the embedding program. What point is a package manager if you can&#x27;t use most of the packages in many environments? This isn&#x27;t just embedded ones - this is on the desktop as well.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for something more capable out-of-the-box, I&#x27;d go for embedding Python or Ruby.

The whole idea of &quot;buy low, sell high&quot; is exploiting inefficiencies in pricing, which is all HFT&#x27;s are doing.

The HFTs are HIGHLY incentivized to not destabilize the market because they stand to lose a LOT of money if they make a mistake.

Historically turning Lua into a general purpose language has been the goal of the whole Kepler project. Whether they succeeded or not is a valid question...<p>And now with LuaJIT there is a clear incentive to use Lua as a general purpose language: it is the fastest dynamic language available. At my previous company we used a lot of LuaJIT on the backend, and I would say it is very doable with the help of a few popular libraries (Penlight + LuaSocket is a good base). The FFI helps a lot too (and makes it an incredible glue language: you don&#x27;t even have to write bindings anymore).<p>I still think Lua is not the best language to write Web applications. We used Python and the Pocoo stack (Flask...) and there is nothing so advanced in Lua (yet?), although frameworks like Lapis have to be considered.

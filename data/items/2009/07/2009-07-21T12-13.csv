Duh.<p>Dan Ariely has done a lot of (better) research showing all the weird effects money has on people.  For instance, people experience more pain relief if they are told that the pill they took cost $5.00, as opposed to $.50.  Unlike this study, at least it's relevant to life.  (Seriously, they're not going to give $100 bills to kids in hospitals to count.)<p>Incidentally, it can have also have negative effects if used as a motivator.  They asked people to a simple computer task, and people did a lot better at it if they were asked to do it ""because it would help the researchers"" than if they received $5.00.  They did the worst if they were only paid $.50.<p>(He has two very good, albeit not very relevant, Ted talks: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/speakers/dan_ariely.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/speakers/dan_ariely.html</a> )",1248179099

The intern wasn't brought on to create a new business model, but he did it anyways.  There would have been no penalty had he never even mentioned the idea.

If everyone is vaccinated except me (or my child in this case), no one will die because there are no carriers.

If 5% aren't vaccinated, that's a lot of potential carriers. Then it becomes a fight of ""i don't want my child vaccinated, but i want your child vaccinated to protect my child.""

But that doesn't mean we don't have better alternatives.<p>1. Most of the professors I had cannot teach as well as a well-written textbook. You can choose your textbooks on Amazon. You cannot (usually) choose your lecture professor. With MIT open course, Berkeley webcast, nowadays you can even choose your professor for without going to college.<p>2. The good professors and grad student that you met in college, why can't you meet them when you are not in college? What stop you from send them emails or just stop by their offices anyway? In fact, I've talked to far more professors who are not in my college than ones that are.<p>3. People who want more than a vocational education will actively go out and get their knowledge. The internet + a good library + Amazon is a far larger reservoir of knowledge than any college. Why do you need an excuse like college to learn more?<p>4. People who just care about a vocational education, and really don't give a damn about liberal arts or general education, why should they let a college force them to learn things useless to them, trick them into thinking that a degree is equal to vocational training, and rob them of their money so they had to spend the rest of their life paying back loans?<p>5. People who network in college, what stops you from networking in the real world? What stop you from talking to people on a bus, in a park, in the subway, in a conference, in a bar, in a farmers market, in your jobs? Most people don't learn networking in college. They are given their network by dorm assignment. Of course, there are exceptions, and those are the people who eventually learn how to network in the real world anyway, so why not start in the real world?<p>I can go on for a while. My point is under-graduate college has it's place, but it certainly shouldn't be the only way.<p>Yes the post author is generalizing. But the fact remains true that most people are not getting what they want out of their college degrees. If that's the way we educate the mass, then there's something wrong with that.",1231967734

Maybe I am wrong, and there really is information being exchanged that I am not seeing.

It's really that simple.<p>Realize too, that simple profit sharing coexists with the normal grading of wages based on whatever position/seniority algorithm the organization uses.  So you're guaranteed, as a developer or designer or whatever, to make your normal wage and be considered for increases.  But every pay period would have that profit sharing bonus that shows you how the business is doing and exactly how much your organization values your contribution.<p>Stock-based incentives are supposed to fulfill this role, but they're often given out after some major event and then only to the most visible members of the contribution.  Arbitrarily, in other words.  Holiday bonuses are nice, too, but they are supposed to be confidential in most organizations (creating uncomfortable speculation and comparisons) and can lead to unmet expectations.",1231967099

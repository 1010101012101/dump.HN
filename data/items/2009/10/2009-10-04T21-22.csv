Where I live, we finally have a competitor to Comcast (Qwest), and t-mobile is also gearing up for a bit of wireless service.  I've heard that some municipalities assert ownership of their power grids, phone lines, pretty much everything that's built on public land, and they force open competition for providing services over those infrastructure pieces.  That would definitely be preferable to net neutrality, but it seems that wresting ownership of infrastructure from the ISPs is even more offensive than the creation of neutrality provisions.  At least new communities can learn from existing ones and have sane starting points for competition, I guess.",1254693070

Once it is established that Washington has that level of control (effectively making a public resource out of private networks), it seems reasonable judging from historical precedence that they will expand their jurisdiction (the special interests will smell blood).<p>(On a meta-note, I wrote 2&3 before seeing your response.

On an abstract level, if you object to provider prioritization, you should probably object to them running separate physical networks for their own services.<p>As to your point about feeling screwed by the (mostly theoretical) possibility of intentional service degradation, I sympathize.  I'll point out though that 1) I'm quite certain this isn't terribly prevalent in the US,  2) in most cases where people think this is happening it is the result of simple under-capacity or generally bad network design or management, and 3) the correct answer to this general issue is to enable provider competition, not to impose ham-handed mandates.",1254692613
860666,comment,860414,860613,0,0,tsuraan,,,"[2] and [3], I think may have been written after I posted, or maybe I'm just blind.  Either way...<p>I'm definitely uncertain about what bad politicians would do with control over the net's structure.  I do know exactly what the CEOs of major ISPs will do though: they will maximize short-term profit.  I've seen a lot of short-term profit maximization in my (rather short) life, and I haven't seen any of it turn out well.  We used to have companies that had long-term goals, fundamental research divisions, the ability to see past next quarter's profits.  I'm not sure where those companies are now, but if they're gone, it seems that the government is the only entity left that can have a long-term goal.  Of course, long-term for our (US) government tends to be the election cycle, which is 2, 4, or 6 years.  Not good, but perhaps not as bad as it could be.  It's also easier to change the government than it is to change a huge company, although neither of those things is an easy thing to do.<p>I'm not sure that net neutrality is quite as sweeping as you see it either.  If congress is getting into peering agreements, protocol design, things like that, then we're definitely all doomed.  If they're just slapping down anti-competitive measures like charging companies for access to ISP subscribers, then I can definitely get behind that.  It's a matter of degrees, I guess.",1254692556

I don't think you'd have to go that far to say what's worth patenting. I think that's the purpose of patents -- to make people disclose worthwhile discoveries so that others can benefit from them at a fee -- but they can't be structured that way legally, because unlike copyright, it's very hard to show the origin of ideas.<p>What makes a patent a bad patent is usually that it's on the idea of what's a good idea to do from a business perspective, and once you've realized that, hey, online auctions are a great idea, the mechanics of writing the code is pretty straightforward, as you say.<p>I'm not clear how things are de facto in European law, but from reading <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_258/03"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_258/03</a> it looks like at least some people are on the right track -- you can patent something involving software, but only if you innovation is technical in nature, not a business innovation that involves a lot of technical details to implement.",1254692273

860659,comment,860414,860613,0,0,tsuraan,,,"To be honest, I'm not actually sure what QOS even has to do with the initial post in this thread; wouldn't a dedicated private ethernet network between the ECC machines and the EBS machines (assuming it's possible within Amazon's network structure) have worked, assuming that their switches are configured to only allow communication between ECC and EBS (forbid ECC - ECC traffic)?  Your commentary about how this would deprioritize other traffic wouldn't then be quite right; it would be a dedicated network, with no cost to any external sites.  It would obviously give EBS an ""unfair"" advantage over anybody who wants to provide an ECC block storage solution to compete with EBS, but honestly, is that a concern?  Nobody's demanding that all internet hosts (end-user included) have the same bandwidth to all other hosts.  It's just artificial crippling of services that are bad, not some things having advantages over others.<p>QoS on the general web doesn't seem likely, as you point out.  Prioritization based on which services can afford to pay off all the nation's ISPs seems like a really bad idea though.  As a service provider, I don't want to have to pay kickbacks to every ISP in the country (world?) to ensure that no unfortunate accidents befall my traffic.  Much more personally, though, as a human, I'm sick of being sold as a product.  I don't watch commercial TV because I'm not a product to be sold to advertisers.  Similarly, I'm not a product for Comcast to sell to google; that's how they see me, but it's not how I see myself.  And, I get pissed off when people see me that way :)",1254692013

6221960,comment,6221602,6221694,7,0,cosmie,,,">because the reason hospitals are able to afford Medicare prices is only because they overcharge the rest<p>That&#x27;s simply not true. Medicare prices are explicitly designed to cover costs, based off of collected data and input from the self-interested American Medical Association[1]. They almost carte blanche accept the AMA at their word, and I doubt the doctors at the AMA are shooting themselves in the foot (although they appear to be backstabbing under-represented GPs). What Medicare <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> do is pay excessively, so poorly ran facilities may go red. One of the motivations behind incentivizing (and soon requiring) electronic health records is the ability it gives Medicare to objectively analyze this information, rather than taking the doctor&#x27;s subjective assessment.<p>What <i>does</i> inflate private insurance rates is unnecessary market saturation, where hospitals are expanding to capture patients from competitors and lowering per-hospital utilization in the process. Particularly an issue with non-profits, which have little other recourse to spend their profits on except higher salaries and facility expansion. The other main reason for higher insurance rates is bad debt, which is the percentage of care hospitals write-off because they don&#x27;t expect to recoup the charges[2]. Since Medicare payments are supposedly break even, this is almost solely absorbed by private insurance. That&#x27;s one of the reasons hospitals are for Obamacare, because there will be fewer uninsured and hence less write offs; yet, current reimbursement contracts account for that bad debt already, so they&#x27;re going to get a lovely profit boost until the payors correct the imbalance.<p>Anecdotely, revenue cycle departments (that collect payments) love Medicare, because <i>it just pays</i>. Private insurers dispute everything and threaten to pass the bill directly to patients, which the hospital knows will never get paid because the member expects their insurance to take care of it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-a-secretive-panel-uses-data-that-distorts-doctors-pay/2013/07/20/ee134e3a-eda8-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-a-secreti...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.acainternational.org/products-health-care-collection-statistics-5434.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acainternational.org/products-health-care-collect...</a>",1376621783

6221956,comment,6220820,6220820,8,0,danenania,,,"I generally agree that there are better ways to handle asynchronous control flow than callbacks, but I think this is exaggerated. As in most posts like this, the callback soup examples are difficult to follow primarily because they are horribly written, not because of callbacks.<p>As long as you write decent code, the main impediment to asynchronous programming is reasoning asynchronously, not syntax. If you require complex asynchronous logic and don&#x27;t use an appropriate algorithm, you&#x27;ll end up in the muck whether you use callbacks or await.<p>Taking go as an example: while I agree that the go statement is more elegant than a callback approach, I see it as quite a minor win compared to channels. The go statement is convenient syntax, but channels are what make concurrency in go feel so robust, and it&#x27;s a pattern than can be applied just as well in a language that uses callbacks.",1376621659

At some point you have to contact some people in the US to carry out the attacks. But oh, the Americans you hired are very wily, and they know that, to be relatively anonymous and have their shenanigans hidden, they have to call from different phones, send emails from different accounts, use different identities, encrypt everything...<p>Mr. American Terrorist Contractor can&#x27;t have all his communications tied to a single identity that could be reassembled with Big Data. So he tries to keep very few traces of his activity, and confuse snoops with false leads and dead ends.<p>Mr. American Terrorist Contractor called from many phones, used many addresses, etc. The dragnet to catch him must be large. It will include some innocent Americans. Tens who called a phone he called that same day. Hundreds who went to the same deli as he went last Friday. Add more situations, area codes, phone call graphs and quickly you have most Americans.<p>That&#x27;s by design, though: you can&#x27;t have surveillance that&#x27;s capable of catching domestic terrorists without surveilling innocent citizens, and you can&#x27;t try to end terrorism with surveillance without spying on the people who will actually perform the terrorist acts in your land.<p>EDIT: As it currently stands, the NSA is supposed to help end terrorism by spying on all foreigners. What I&#x27;m arguing is that surveillance of non-citizens always leads to surveillance of citizens. Some Americans are uncomfortable with the US government spying on American citizens, but comfortable with the USG spying on foreigners. They may be less comforted when they realize how, if the real intent of the surveillance is to prevent terrorism, only spying on foreigners won&#x27;t help much.",1376621430

The callback hell that I see most often happens when people have hundreds of lines of inception style anonymous callback functions inside of anonymous callback functions.

What is MKV? MKV stands for Matroska, a file format that is capable of holding an unlimited number of videos, pictures, audio or subtitle tracks just in a single file. It is generally known as Matroska Multimedia Container. Compared with MP4, AVI, etc, which are lossy formats, MKV can be lossless. So an MKV video can be pretty large in terms of size, even its duration is very short. So if you want to burn such kind of MKV videos into DVD format, the resulting DVD quality could be very impressive. How to achieve that? You just come to a DVD creator software, which is able to convert MKV videos into regular DVD format and burn it onto blank DVD discs, such as DVDFab DVD Creator, a very popular one in this field.",1376620170

6221888,comment,6221016,6221016,5,0,calbear81,,,"This was published on my birthday so I thought it would be good to reflect on the same points:<p>1. Public Transportation - The MUNI is definitely one of the worst run transportation systems for a large city but I find that having a city that&#x27;s only 6 miles wide means that I can find other means of getting around including biking, walking, getting a Lyft (Uber if I must), and occasionally catching a MUNI train which I find much more reliable than MUNI buses which I avoid at all costs.<p>2. Parking - See #1. If you have a bike, you will get places much faster than in a car. In terms of parking, you can use apps like SFPark to find open spots and garages. The prices are pretty ridiculous so I tend to find more happiness in walking or biking around.<p>3. Weather - The variable weather means a bunch of diverse microclimates all around the city and beyond which makes for amazing hiking and exploration. I love going from sunshine to dense fog as I cross the Golden Gate bridge and then back to sunshine again on the other side, it reminds me of the awesomeness of nature.<p>4. Start Up Guys - I don&#x27;t disagree that there&#x27;s more to life than the startup scene but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with people who have found something they are so interested in that they can&#x27;t stop talking about it. Bask in the energy and excitement that they have, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.<p>5. 49ers - My understanding was that San Francisco is a great place for guys especially since there is a significant part of the male population that is off the market. Other guys I&#x27;ve talked to have found the same thing. In terms of girls who are &quot;4&#x27;s&quot; behaving like they are &quot;9&#x27;s&quot; is more due to the fact that people here probably don&#x27;t focus as much on looks alone like they might do in other places. Girls who have high self esteem and have a good sense of self and self-worth should behave like 9&#x27;s because they are. Who are we to judge?<p>6. Homeless People - Pretty good way to reinforce stereotypes about homeless people by painting them all as drug addicts and alcoholics. You know why they are the &quot;craziest&quot;? It&#x27;s because many of them do have mental health issues and as a society based on our past and current policies have failed to adequately address the situation. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re inconvenienced by the homeless folks who remind you that there are those less fortunate but you might want to take it as a constant reminder of how good we have it and to enjoy all the niceties that we take for granted in everyday life -- like a hot meal and a roof over our heads.<p>7. Crime - The Tenderloin is R-O-U-G-H, no doubt about it but it&#x27;s one of the only areas of this prosperous city that working class families can afford to live in. Fear mongering keeps folks away and further isolates the area and introduces more likelihood of crime. I&#x27;m excited that Sunday Streets this weekend will be in the Tenderloin so folks can see that there&#x27;s more to the TL than crime and addicts. Eat at some great restaurants in the Tenderloin including the original Lers Ros (better than the Hayes Valley location), Turtle Tower and other awesome places.<p>8. Nightlife - It&#x27;s certainly no New York but there&#x27;s plenty happening in SF and yes the 2AM close time does suck but if you know where to go, the party lives on into the night. What I love about nightlife is that it&#x27;s not just clubs and bars, you can find a diverse range of activities in SF, from poetry readings to spoken word slams to BDSM lectures to Jersey-Shore style clubbing. There&#x27;s something for everyone. Just make sure you pre-plan how you&#x27;re getting home (psssst! try making a friend and crashing at their place near downtown instead!)<p>9. Cost of Living - I can&#x27;t argue about this one but I do feel that living in San Francisco should cost more especially when you consider the amazing beauty all around you. Cross the bridge and you&#x27;re in the Marin Headlands where you can hike along the Pacific Coast with hundreds of miles of trails within minutes of a major city. 3 hours away and you have world class skiing. 2 hours south and you have world class golf. 1 hour north and you&#x27;re at the epicenter of wine making in the New World. Outside of New York and Vancouver, where else will you find an urban park as large as Golden Gate Park to enjoy? It&#x27;s an amazing confluence of culture, food, arts and nature.<p>10. Bicyclists - Do I stop for all stop signs? Not really but I always slow down to a crawl and look both ways before crossing. Bicyclists definitely should do a better job of observing the rules of the road but I also love that this city is so pro bicyling with bike lanes and a positive bike culture. The drivers here are also waaaaaaay more respectful about sharing the road which makes biking here much safer than in New York and Los Angeles. I love that the city is so compact, you can see so much on a bike in just a few hours.<p>TLDR; Yeah, some things suck about SF but look on the bright side and explore all the awesomeness around you.",1376620020

When you introduce a project, it&#x27;s better to get people thinking about it, nitpicking and even questioning the point of your project, than to get a few replies of &quot;Nice!&quot; and be ignored in the long term.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed another thing: most things of which I&#x27;m initially slightly dismissive fail to reach any success, but the things I&#x27;m very dismissive succeed. I&#x27;ve seen products get very harsh feedback and, a few months later, the products were successful, had better user experiences, and their users loved them.<p>But the visceral reaction to his project may have to do with the kind of expectations we have from web use vs. installed software.<p>I know some people install anything they happen by, and will try all one-line command line installs and random .pkgs they find, but most people who care about security are wary of installing closed source software from a not-very-known third party, or run arbitrary code in a virtual machine.<p>When you browse the web, there&#x27;s an expectation of not worrying about security and malicious code execution. Javascript blurs that line, but it&#x27;s mostly kept away from the innards of the host. Installed software is more intimate; in some ways, it&#x27;s like letting a stranger into your kitchen, but not into into your bedroom. Of course, they can do harm in the kitchen too, but the bedroom has implications that go beyond physical access.<p>HN can be very negative sometimes, and seeing angry or snide comments makes me sad too. You can give concrete, actionable advice and feedback without being an asshole, and no, that&#x27;s not pretending to be nice, it&#x27;s simply not going out of your way to be rude.

Setting aside bad behavior from Monsanto specifically (suing farmers, patents, sterile seeds), there is both promise and peril to GMOs, even in the simple act of selective breeding that comprises most of the activity in that space.<p>My primary concern is the lack of long-term thinking in the drive for high production yield, and accompanying side effects to health and ecosystems. For instance, some claim that the high-yield &quot;dwarf wheat&quot; pioneered in the 60s is responsible for exacerbating gluten sensitivity: <a href=""http://marksdailyapple.com/the-problems-with-modern-wheat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marksdailyapple.com/the-problems-with-modern-wheat/</a><p>There is also an overlapping concern with the broken patent system, and whether it is acceptable to &quot;own&quot; the genetic results of evolution, whether human-guided or otherwise. It&#x27;s not hard to conceive of some scary slippery slopes there.<p>Each individual advancement is probably, on average, not a big deal, and probably a win for both providers and consumers. But if you aggregrate the accelerating advances over decades and centuries, I think there are real consequences for human health and the biosphere.

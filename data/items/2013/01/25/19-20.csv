It seemed to me dreadful that the doom of a 'job' should \n  descend upon anyone at fourteen. Of course I know now that there is not one \n  working-class boy in a thousand who does not pine for the day when he will \n  leave school. He wants to be doing real work, not wasting his time on \n  ridiculous rubbish like history and geography. To the working class, the \n  notion of staying at school till you are nearly grown-up seems merely \n  contemptible and unmanly. The idea of a great big boy of eighteen, who \n  ought to be bringing a pound a week home to his parents, going to school in \n  a ridiculous uniform and even being caned for not doing his lessons! Just \n  fancy a working-class boy of eighteen allowing himself to be caned! He is a \n  man when the other is still a baby. Ernest Pontifex, in Samuel Butler's Way \n  of All Flesh, after he had had a few glimpses of real life, looked back on \n  his public school and university education and found it a 'sickly, \n  debilitating debauch'.

This is especially true if the landlord has had ample time to renovate, find tenants, or sell the property... If he has failed to do so, he is actually contributing to the shortage of affordable housing by driving prices up.<p>Regulations permitting squatting put pressure on landlords, which seemed to work pretty well.  Landlords used ""anti-squat"" tactics - renting out vacant properties on a temporary basis (i.e. with the option to evict at any moment) to prevent a squat.  These rates were excellent in Amsterdam, and many students and would-be squatters took advantage of this, effectively bringing 'squatting' into the economy.",1359143687

Its a pretty chilling example when you realize that there are people who actually think that way on a daily basis.<p>I heard a story when visiting London, which may have been completely fabricated, in the context of comparing the morals of banking vs gambling. It told of a book maker who learned that a critical soccer player's girlfriend was planning to commit suicide. Rather than report that information to the authorities to save the girl he used it to bet against the team (the favorite) and won a much bigger return than he would have otherwise when her attempted suicide kept their star from playing. Part of our discussion was whether or not the 'criminal element' which was attracted to gambling (I grew up in Las Vegas just as they were cleaning out the Mafia influence there) was the same or different than the people attracted to Banking. In both contexts 'score keeping' was a simple metric of how much money you had.<p>If you are an ""important person"" and someone communicates to you that something is rotten in the bowels of the system and its going to come exploding out in a vile smelly mess. You might ask yourself, ""What am I going to do with this information?"" What would a gambler do? What would a banker do? What would a politician do?<p>If you are a TV news conglomerate you might say, ""Hmm its one small story of abuse now, but if it really does take out a big chunk of the financial industry its going to be huge! Lets sit on it and plan on how we're going to get big market share from people tuning into us for our indepth coverage!""<p>If the person getting the information convinces themselves that there is nothing they personally can do to stop it, they can give themselves permission to exploit it (which is usually, but not always, easier).  If you can profit handsomely if it happens, and not so much if it doesn't, then what? You see a shark in the water do you yell ""Shark!"" or do you start recording video thinking about the 10 million YouTube views this will get if you catch it eating someone?<p>Its Ethics 101. It's why you fire people in your company for even minor ethical violations. It's why you volunteer to run oversight on a local public utilities commission or school board. It's why you go back into the store and return the extra $10 they gave you in change, or pay for product you absently stuck in your pocket and wasn't charged for. It's why you stop interacting with people who aren't ethical.",1359143471

That is ludicrous at its face.<p>If someone issues you a loan in good faith, and you cannot repay, it is indeed their loss.  They have not committed crime however.<p>In the case of a personal loan if you fail to repay, the bank can go to court and get a judgement against you.  With that judgement they might be able to make a claim on such assets as to make themselves whole.  They cannot ""take all of your material possessions"" let alone send you to prison.  This is very far from what happened...<p>In the case of a mortgage, the can foreclose on the property, liquidate it and use the proceeds to make themselves whole.  Note that anything collected in excess of the loan must be passed back to the borrower.  (This rarely happens, because if the property were worth more than the loan, the borrower would just sell or refinance.)  After a foreclosure and sale, if the bank is still not whole, in many states they may not come after the borrower for the balance (this is called ""no-recourse"") in other states they can (""recourse"").  In the industry so called ""subprime"" loans were often referred to a ""home equity"", because there was an acknowledgement that these were borrowers were greater risk, but the loan was guaranteed by the value of the home, and as long as home prices did not drop significantly they were of little risk.<p>It is almost never advantageous for the bank for the not to repay a loan, as the most the bank can do is be made whole by recovery, and almost never is.<p>Finally that is not how loan sharking works.",1359143102

5117164,comment,5116937,5116937,1,0,matznerd,,,"I first heard about squatting while I was in Amsterdam in 2007. They even had squatted restaurants. The rule there was that if you found a building not lived in for 12-months, you could break in, put your own lock, a table, chair, and bed then call the cops and let them know you were squatting. The process to kick out a squatter could last over a year. I just learned that it was outlawed in 2010, but that it still goes on.<p>------<p>""In the past a building could be used legally by someone who needed to squat if it was empty and not in use for twelve months, and the owner had no pressing need to use it (such as a rental contract starting in the next month). The only illegal aspect was forcing an entry, if that was necessary. When a building was squatted, it was normal to send the owner a letter and to invite the police to inspect the squat. The police checked whether the place was indeed lived in by the squatter. In legal terms, this means there must be a bed, a chair, a table and a working lock on the door which the squatter can open and close.<p>In cities, there was often a kraakspreekuur (squatters' consultation hour), at which people planning to squat could get advice from experienced squatters. In Amsterdam, where the squatting community is still large, there are four kraakspreekuur sessions in different areas of the city, and so-called ""wild"" squatting (squatting a building without the help of the local group) is not encouraged.[27] Dutch squatters use the term krakers to refer to people who squat houses with the aim of living in them (as opposed to people who break into buildings for the purpose of vandalism or theft).[5]\n...<p>On October 1, 2010, squatting was finally outlawed in The Netherlands after the Squatting Ban Bill was passed into law by both houses of Parliament. On October 28, 2011, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands decided that the legally forced end of squatting can only occur after an intervention of a judge.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting#History</a>",1359141980

I have about 500 to do in total and I've done about 300 so far. My intent was to deliver them around the same time as the beta release, so that the thanks would be meaningful.<p>> The stated goal for raising $25K (and any excess) was to take time off of work to dedicate 100% to this, at least until Rails.app shipped. What happened?<p>You're absolutely right. The original plan was to be able to take a few months off of work and use it to replace any lost company revenue. In other words, I was going to pay for my own time to replace consulting revenue. Co-founding a company turned out to be more time-consuming than I expected (I know that sounds stupid, but it's the first time I did it), so I wasn't able to purchase my own time in a single block. Instead, I used whatever available time I could manage and used the money to fund smaller blocks of time.<p>I also used some of it to fund full-time work by Patrick Gibson, an amazing iOS/Cocoa developer (he worked on the original iPad build process for Apple and the Batch app) who works for Tilde, so I could focus my energies on the necessary Ruby code.<p>I'm really sorry that my original estimates didn't work out. That was absolutely a mistake on my part and I have learned a lot from the mistake (and my inability to follow my original plan precisely has caused me a great deal of heartburn). In the long run, I will not allow this error to prevent Tokaido from shipping. See my other comments on this thread for more details.",1359141757

Unless there is a hidden feature somewhere, I really don't see how it's big or why YC invested in it. Sure, it's useful. Sure, it's cool. But I'm afraid that it doesn't solve a big enough problem. Obviously, I'm saying that based on my own experience and knowledge:<p>- As a developer, integrating the various analytic libraries is trivial. Installing it? (npm install mixpanel) is mostly trivial too. Yes, it'll take a couple hours, but it will still take several hours to set up Segment too. (One might argue that's not true, but that's wrong. Even if you include the Segment.io code, you still need to provide a bunch of options and understand very well all the other analytic libraries.)<p>- As a manager, I don't want yet another 30$ or 150$ / month when I'm already paying that for the other analytic services. Also, I know for a fact that I can easily find a dev to set up all the analytics for less than 200$.<p>- As an investor, I ask myself: What's their unfair advantage? It seems like everyone could do such a service and even provide an open-source version of it.<p>So, yeah, I'm a bit lost. I feel it's a big like Grove.io. I really liked the idea and found it very useful. But I didn't see how it'd work as a business. But then, there are hundreds of huge companies that I don't even get their business model. (Twitter?)

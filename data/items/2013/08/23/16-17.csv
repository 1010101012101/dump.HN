The money comes as a result of that. Even as a child he saw this... knowing that he had to get to the US because it attracted the smartest.

Over that time the stock went from roughly $28.5 to roughly $34.5, while giving out a total of $3.51 in dividends per share. Inflation has a slight but non-trivial effect (adjusting that $28.5 stock price to about $30.9 in today&#x27;s dollars). Overall you get a total rate of return on MSFT stock of about 23.5% over that 5 year period (even adjusting for inflation of the value of the dividends).<p>That works out to an annualized return of about 4.3%.

Since 2004, MSFT has returned over $164 billion [1] to shareholders in a ~50/50 split of buybacks and dividends -- on today&#x27;s balance sheet, that cash would be worth an incremental ~$20/share (assuming $0 reinvested). Meanwhile, revenue and free cash flow have grown at a respectable 12.4% compounded, and it wasn&#x27;t until 2012 that Apple passed Microsoft in terms of gross profit.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue that Ballmer&#x27;s been the most innovative CEO of his era, but as a custodian of shareholder value, it&#x27;s pretty hard to fault him.

By and large, the reason why women don&#x27;t become leaders is because <i>they don&#x27;t ask to</i>.  1) It&#x27;s not a feasible social model for everyone sitting around being humble, expecting to become a leader &quot;because they have the right personality profile for it&quot;.  2) to be effective, realistically leaders need to have a level of expertise to critically judge the project - leaving it to advisors to make the lion&#x27;s share of those decisions can lead to serious derailment (which is why the MBA culture is seriously flawed).<p>&quot;Lean in&quot; may be a bit extreme, but we DO have a problem where for whatever reason women don&#x27;t ASK to be leaders, and when they do they don&#x27;t NEGOTIATE for more power or pay.  For whatever sociocultural reason, we seem to be in the business of shielding women from the emotional risk of failure.  This is deeply ingrained in our culture:  although both are changing, on the centuries-old social dance floor men ask women for dances, men ask women for dates.  The head of the institute where I work famously owns a Tesla Model S, and this high school intern is somewhat obsessive about the Teslas, and I told her, &quot;go ask him for a ride around the block&quot;, and all I got were nine months of excuses not to.<p>To be sure, it takes a modicum of narcissism to ask for a position of leadership, just as it takes some narcissism to ask for a dance on the dance floor (I deserve to dance with this person) or ask for a date (I deserve to go on a date).  Labelling narcissism in and of itself as a bad is dangerous, what is dangerous is excessive narcissism to the exclusion of humility and reason.<p>Anecdotally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hard for women to accepted as leaders.  When I worked for one, it was not a problem, I seriously had a lot of respect for her.  Ok.  So maybe I did once think of her as &quot;crazy&quot; - but it was only on the day when she hyperbolically threatened to kill the grad students if they used the wrong pipette, and they sort of deserved to hear it, their performance and lack of intellectual introspection was unacceptably low.  However, I do work in academic science where positions of leadership are more often than normal (but I would not say a majority of the time) earned through directly relevant achievement.  In the &quot;normal&quot; case, it might be easier to shrug off an incompetent or perceived incompetent leader.  I do sometimes wonder, though, if whether or not I and others respected her, if she wasn&#x27;t still self-conscious about it.",1377276370

Sunstein (proposed member of a panel to review the surveillance practices of the National Security Agency) and Adrian Vermeule, dated January 15, 2008<p>Abstract: <i>Many millions of people hold conspiracy theories; they believe that powerful people have worked together in order to withhold the truth about some important practice or some terrible event. A recent example is the belief, widespread in some parts of the world, that the attacks of 9/11 were carried out not by Al Qaeda, but by Israel or the United States. Those who subscribe to conspiracy theories may create serious risks, including risks of violence, and the existence of such theories raises significant challenges for policy and law. The first challenge is to understand the mechanisms by which conspiracy theories prosper; the second challenge is to understand how such theories might be undermined. Such theories typically spread as a result of identifiable cognitive blunders, operating in conjunction with informational and reputational influences. A distinctive feature of conspiracy theories is their self-sealing quality. Conspiracy theorists are not likely to be persuaded by an attempt to dispel their theories; they may even characterize that very attempt as further proof of the conspiracy. Because those who hold conspiracy theories typically suffer from a crippled epistemology, in accordance with which it is rational to hold such theories, the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups. Various policy dilemmas, such as the question whether it is better for government to rebut conspiracy theories or to ignore them, are explored in this light.</i><p>File under &quot;elite panic&quot; <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/04/elite_panic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/04/elite_panic.h...</a>",1377275852

I see you disagree, but I don&#x27;t know how a GUI could be created without being built on something at a lower level. Something has to cause it to work, somewhere between bits and hardware, and the screen. Double click to open file? Same as `open file`. Find and replace in a text editor? Same as sed or `s//`.<p>A GUI can make it easier to do those things, but not always. For example I find using git in a GUI to be a worse experience than it&#x27;s command line counterpart. I&#x27;m more at home with `git diff` than whatever built in attempt at improvement is available. I&#x27;d rather edit and resolve conflicts in vim than a visual editor (even XCode which is a pretty nice diff tool).<p>In short I just don&#x27;t see myself ever moving off of terminal, and I would never see knowledge of it as a handicap.

With ad revenue declining across the web, freeware/open source developers and hosters will need to find other avenues to support things.  SourceForge was in a <i>very</i> precarious position financially a few years ago as ad revenue fell and there was whisperings of them shutting down entirely.<p>Offer-based installers are one way of monetizing and have become exceedingly popular, especially with closed-source freeware.  Unfortunately, most of these installers are designed to trick users into installing (or go so far as to install without use consent).  To SourceForge&#x27;s credit, they make a single offer which is clearly defined and even have a link to a page explaining why the offer is made.  Compare this to your typical download from Download.com which includes multiple offers including several tricks to get you to install (pages that seem to be license agreements for the main software but install adware when you click agree, pages that list a standard and a custom install type and you&#x27;ll get adware unless you pick custom and uncheck the offer, etc).<p>The other option is freemium pricing, free for smaller users but bigger users pay.  To go this route, you basically need to go after the enterprise to make money.  Github has taken this route from the beginning and achieved profitability in 2009 if I recall.  I&#x27;m not sure if Github is still profitable, but they got $100m in funding last year, so they have money to burn.  That could be why the added binary hosting back in.  They had it originally but removed it due to costs years ago.   Still, I&#x27;m unsure if they would put up with a project as large as the ones on SourceForge (PortableApps.com, FileZilla, GIMP for Windows, etc) as that is quite a bit of bandwidth to give away for free as a loss leader (since Github wouldn&#x27;t even make money on ads for those downloads).  Unfortunately, SourceForge has no enterprise offerings at present, so this isn&#x27;t a viable revenue source today.  They could explore this route in the future as a competitor to Github, though.  It would be a bit of a pivot for them and not without its own risks.  But, even if they go down this route, they still need to have the revenue today to keep going.

They just hit the basic high points because this video is intended for a general rather than specific audience.<p>A qubit exists in multiple states until measured. When you entangle multiple qubits together, each one increases the power of the system exponentially. Quantum computers are only good for certain kinds of problems like factoring large prime numbers. Luckily quantum systems are good at things classic computers aren&#x27;t, and vice versa. You have to state your &quot;question&quot; in such a way that it causes the overall state of the quantum system to resolve on your answer.<p>I know my answer isn&#x27;t much better.

Imagine the Traveling Salesman problem. You want the best route. But with a regular computer, it might take thousands of years to calculate the best route. With a quantum computer, if you structure the measurement correctly (this is how you &quot;program&quot; a quantum computer) then only the best route is what the system decoheres to.<p>There was also something about light and how if you had the right filter, only the answer gets through.

A GUI interface gives me a lot of clues as to how to do things I didn&#x27;t know about before.  A CLI requires that knowledge prior to doing anything.<p>Give me an unfamiliar GUI and there are cues.  I can click on things, right click on things, hover over things, touch things, whatever.  I can explore with a GUI.  I can even learn, or at least get the queues to learn.<p>Give me an unfamiliar CLI and I&#x27;m kind of stuck.  I can type. What can I type?  Maybe I have some experience and I try help.  Maybe from that I get a list of commands with no context.  Where do I go from there?  Linux &quot;help&quot; doesn&#x27;t even describe &quot;man&quot;.<p>I understand IPv4 well.  I can configure a network interface or wifi on any typical GUI I come across.  If I want to do it in linux, I don&#x27;t even know where to start.  In windows, understanding IPv4 and stumbling around the control panels, network settings etc will allow me to configure my adapter.  On my phone, going to settings, wifi, tapping the little arrow beside my connection will let me manually assign an IP address.<p>In Linux, if I want to do that, I need to look up a reference to learn how to use ifconfig. There are no queues to guide me, and the language is specific to that environment. I don&#x27;t learn anything about TCP/IP through this process, I only learn about linux.<p>On the other hand, in a GUI, it gives me more information than I ask for.  Going into my network connection properties in windows shows me all the clients, services, protocols that are enabled for the connection, it gives me a shortcut to change the particular settings of the NIC driver.  Delving into the IPv4 settings it tells me that DHCP is enabled, it lets me change the DNS suffix search list, assign additional gateways, etc.<p>The GUI is a teaching tool as much as it is an interface.  What it teaches isn&#x27;t necessarily comprehensive, but it does teach.<p>The CLI on the other hand is much more limited in how it can provide feedback to the user.  It can try to, but it&#x27;s got more limitations; text-only, no diagrams, few abstractions.<p>For a child in a structured learning environment, a CLI might be better.  It rewards discovery, it limits the interactions, it provides fewer distractions.  But without external teaching materials, I think if you give a child a computer with linux and no window manager on it, and you give a child a computer with Windows or Mac OS on it, your child would learn a lot more about the computer from the latter options.",1377273793

The exchange operator(s) have access to all information about orders placed - and also have bitcoin holdings themselves. The potential for manipulation here is unlimited. I do not mean to accuse them of anything - there is no information. But this is not a healthy situation, given, as others have said, absolutely no legal protection.<p>EDIT: I want to strengthen the statement that I'm not accusing the operator of manipulation. He's well-respected by bitcoin forum participants, and he is probably an upstanding guy. But in the world of finance, it is customary to have more than just that to guarantee the soundness of a central exchange.<p>Add to this the fact that Mt. Gox is taking deposits totaling in the millions of dollars without having any license to operate as a financial institution, and that it apparently hold around 10% of all existing bitcoins (someone traced a 470,000 bitcoin movement to a Mt.

2650475,comment,2649764,2650288,8,0,cookiecaper,,,"Many people hear that btc is an ""anonymous currency"" and think they're free to participate in all kinds of illicit activity on btc. The reality is that every btc transaction made is publicly recorded and the so-called ""anonymity"" depends on the obscurity of the btc addresses used in the transaction. Also note that these implications are not necessarily isolated to one transaction; if you and your partner both make a trade using new btc addresses, the coins that were traded can be traced all the way back to their generation and perhaps someone two transactions up the chain will provide a lead as to who is doing what (""oh yeah, that was a trade I made with Johnny..."").<p>Additionally, if the government ever seizes the wallet of a dealer, which is likely to occur in the event that a search warrant is executed, they will have a list of addresses with whom the dealer has traded. These addresses can then be found and traced in the publicly-available tx chain. In this way even innocent people may be implicated in investigations surrounding illicit trades, and trading with a person that doesn't understand the implications of reusing or publishing a btc address can significantly weaken not only your transactions but other transactions that occur in the network.<p>The anonymity issues surrounding bitcoin are certainly more thorny than they appear on the surface. If you intend on using btc for illegal purposes, you need to understand what you're doing and be very careful, just as I'd imagine you need to do when trading illegally in other media.",1307994993

Market goes rational (inevitable, forces pushing it irrational can't do so forever), valuation plumets [sic]</i><p>It's a nitpick, but the only irrationality that gets checked is unsustainable irrationality. It's a bit of a simplification to say that profits are actually ""equilibrium irrationality,"" but not by much. If the market were actually composed of rational agents, all prices would be driven down to material cost + wages, and there'd be no need for advertising, either. Forces can, and in fact always do, push the market to irrationality. The only thing the market seems to do is moderate the degree of irrational excess.<p>I'm not really going anywhere with this. I just have a fascination with people's manifold faith in markets and their powers.

Denzel Washington and Leonardo DiCaprio are fine actors, but you don't need an actor of their caliber or pay to make a decent movie.  There's plenty of ""just below top-flight"" talent in acting, writing, and directing (and arguably some of it is better than the ""top-flight"" stuff), more than enough to make some perfectly serviceable and entertaining movies/TV.<p>Hollywood movies in theaters can sell loads of tickets, and smaller movies can subsist off of rabid fans, but there's not really a mid-line distribution path where I can (a) reach out to a few million people and (b) get them to pay some amount between $5 and $15.  Yeah, there's Netflix, but Netflix+DVD sales isn't much money, and Netflix doesn't promote, so it's hard for people to stumble across your movie.<p>Someone below suggested that video games have the same problem, and I'd argue that's distribution-related as well.  On the high end, there are commercials and promotions and E3 demos for games like CoD or WoW, and on the low end, most of the guys making money depend on getting promoted through ""featured game of the day"" deals or ""top rated"" sections in their app stores or viral marketing or by just being so cheap it's an impulse buy.  There's no real mechanism for a $15-$30 game to receive enough exposure that large groups of people will choose to buy it.

2650429,comment,2648720,2649366,8,0,bugsy,,,"How this works in practice is servers are fired if they do not sign off that they earned the difference in tips. This is a big issue with fast food restaurants like Pizza Hut, and cheap buffets where there is a lunch rush and then a slow period, coupled with a propensity of patrons of this sort of place not to tip because they think it is a buffet or fast food restaurant, not one where servers are paid $2.35. Often you have slow periods where there might not be any customers. Let's say from 1-5pm at Pizza Hut you have 3 tables and each leaves $1. So you made $3 in a 4 hr part time shift. You get paid $2.35 * 4 = $9.40 for those three hours. If minimum wage in your state is $8.25, you are required to report that you made $23.60 in tips during that period, not $3. You then pay various taxes on those phantom wages, notably social security and medicare tax, which are regressive flat taxes. You also may find yourself being forced to split the phantom wages with the dishwasher and manager. Often you make less than $0 during your shift. Some people can make up the difference during the dinner and lunch shifts, but those usually go to senior employees and the more attractive women. Getting more than 4-6 hrs a day is hard because then you are no longer a part time employee, which means the employer might have to start paying benefits, which would ruin their entire business model that relies on $2.35/hr wages and no benefit costs. Talk to anyone who works at Pizza Hut or most buffet chains to hear more about this in great detail, I have heard about this situation from dozens of people over the last 30 years.",1307994318

In practice this would be unacceptably slow and if the compiler can prove that such an exception can never happen, the check will be removed.<p>As for the ""simple"" example of testing ""y == 0"", this is actually already undecidable.

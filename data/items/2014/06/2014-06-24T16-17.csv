FYI I&#x27;m sure many companies were all doing these things before Google, they are just an easy example.<p>1) Google moderator was invented because it was used internally for Google&#x27;s TGIF (which is essentially a giant version of the &quot;contrarian office hours&quot;)<p>2) Google obviously has tons of tech talks of many different topics that are not only available to people in the company but are often posted to youtube for everybody<p>3) 1:1s are great (this isn&#x27;t just common to Google but practically any well-managed company), but if this company reaches 100 employees then there is no way the CEO will be able to have effective meetings with everybody, and it probably wouldn&#x27;t be a good use of time either.  At that time they will need to come up with a sane management structure (very hard) that hasn&#x27;t been required yet.<p>Also my favorite part is:<p>“We tell our employees to check their egos at the door, so as a company we need to do the same thing,”<p>Coming from the CEO, in an article talking about almost exclusively about how great he is, which includes 2 pictures of himself and 0 pictures of anybody else on his team.",1403629179

7938806,comment,7937723,7938672,2,0,refurb,,,"You&#x27;ve made several erroneous claims, so I&#x27;ll comment on a few of them:<p>Hospitals are not required to treat, but most do.  It is general knowledge in the industry that if you can&#x27;t afford treatment for your cancer you go to a local hospital where you <i>will</i> be treated regardless of ability to pay.<p>Yes the US spends more than any other industrialized nation, but no, health outcomes are <i>not</i> the worst.  If you use blunt tools like life expectancy to measure outcomes, the US ranks far behind, but that is only because of other extraneous factors that have nothing to do with quality of care.  Check out cancer patient outcomes for colorectal cancer sometime, the US outcomes easily outstrip those of other countries.<p>Medicaid is not only for the extremely poor.  The ACA just bumped up Medicaid income eligibility to 133% of poverty level.  That&#x27;s over $30K for a family, so I wouldn&#x27;t say that&#x27;s &quot;extremely poor&quot;.<p>I have no idea where the &quot;Medicare kicks in for the old because it is unprofitable&quot; comes from.  It was a social benefit put into place in the 1950&#x27;s.  The insurance industry has nothing to do with it.<p>No you can&#x27;t lose your home over medical bills.  Your primary residence is protected when you go bankrupt.  Also, even in nations with single payer systems patients end up financial difficulties when sick <i>because they can&#x27;t work</i>.<p>I suggest you do some more research and educate yourself on these issues rather than repeating what others tell you.",1403629151

7938803,comment,7937323,7937715,2,0,gambiting,,,"I disagree with this statement a lot.\nI will give you an example, based on trains.\nIn the country where I come from, Poland, trains lines are owned by the government, which makes them incredibly cheap. I know a lot of people who commute long distances to work or study,because the ticket for a 2 hour long journey costs an equivalent of $2-3 USD.<p>However, now I live in the UK, and despite the standard of living being much higher, and people making a lot more money in general, I know very few people who regularly take trains to go anywhere, because prices are &quot;as high as the market will bear&quot;,which makes commuting longer distances very expensive - due to the fact that all train lines are private and they charge whatever they see fit, with higher prices during rush hours, and so on.<p>And no, the solution is not to subsidize poor people. In fact, I would not describe myself poor, making $30k a year, and I still would not take a train every day, as it would be ruining financially. In Poland, even if I was making a third of what I make here I could afford to commute by train every day, as it is absurdly cheap.<p>I feel like the same thing applies here. Cheap, publicly owned parking spaces guarantee better opportunities for everyone, and that&#x27;s how it should be like.",1403629140

I would never say that hard work won&#x27;t make you successful in the US, but coming from a wealthy family creates a lot of opportunities earlier on in life that poor kids will have to work hard to see. Coming from a wealthy, or even upper middle class, family means maybe your summer senior year of high school is spent interning with your uncle&#x27;s firm instead of working for extra spending money. It means you can ask your parents for career advice (poor parents don&#x27;t have career advice because they don&#x27;t have careers).

If they are looking for managers, they typically are looking for experienced managers and aren&#x27;t necessarily trying to identify someone who is prime to move into that role.<p>You should emphasize any leadership experience on your resume and LinkedIn. If you list yourself as a &quot;Full-stack Dev&quot;, that is probably all you will get calls about. Call yourself &quot;Lead Dev&quot;.<p>It could be risky to mention something like &quot;Interest in management positions&quot; on LinkedIn - depends on who is paying attention to your profile. You could also do some SEO type work on your profile, adding words that recruiters might use to find managers. As an example, recruiters might get a request for a manager that knows about Agile or Scrum. Sneaking in methodology buzzwords could help you appear in those searches, though I&#x27;m not sure how likely someone would be to contact you if you didn&#x27;t give the appearance of someone interested in or capable of managing.<p>You might be better off being proactive and contacting a recruiter directly to get their suggestions and help you market your background to those types of positions.

At the time, tuition was about $50k/year. Without them utterly sacrificing their entire nest-egg or moving out of their own house, paying for school on their own was entirely out of the question.

Much of his essay takes on the notion that the US will be fine if innovation happens in silicon valley and manufacturing happens elsewhere (this is an oversimplification, I&#x27;d recommend you read the essay).<p>But what really resonated with me here is that scaling <i>is</i> innovation, and that by splitting the two and neglecting the second, the US has put itself at a disadvantage, not just in the jobs generated downstream from high end innovative work, but in the ability to do that innovative work itself...<p>&quot;I believe the answer has to do with a general undervaluing of manufacturing—the idea that as long as &quot;knowledge work&quot; stays in the U.S., it doesn&#x27;t matter what happens to factory jobs... I disagree. Not only did we lose an untold number of jobs, we broke the chain of experience that is so important in technological evolution. As happened with batteries, abandoning today&#x27;s &quot;commodity&quot; manufacturing can lock you out of tomorrow&#x27;s emerging industry.&quot;<p>One reason this resonates so heavily with me is that I actually got an MS in Industrial Engineering, and I, like almost all of my cohort, work in software now.  The closes I came was writing software for manufacturing systems, and many of our clients were overseas.  But I never did learn how to scale, and an entire generation of potential leaders in scaling up manufacturing the US pretty much had to find something else to do (perhaps using those stochastic processes to figure out how to get people to click on ads rather than reducing defect rates in the mass scale manufacting of solar panels).<p>When it&#x27;s time to manufacture mass numbers of drones (per the discussion above, I could easily see the average US family owning quite a few drones).  We may not make them in the US, but the reason might actually not be cost, it may be skill - we may simply not have the experience with scaling on physical systems - partly because we skipped a couple of generations and we just don&#x27;t have the experience anymore.<p>Now (my own hobby horse), add in the fact that the US seems to be perfectly OK with watching the enrollment of US citizens in graduate engineering programs plummet (perhaps a rational decision at the individual level), and if high end work shifts along with production, we may find we can no longer wave the magic wand and get talented people to come here.  Fix immigration all you like, the top talent may go elsewhere and no longer bother with the US.<p>I&#x27;m putting forth a bleak scenario, and I&#x27;ll admit it contains a few slippery slopes, so this is meant as a call for concern, not a prediction.  But I think that the US needs to pay a lot of attention to our future workforce in serious, large scale manufacturing engineering, and we&#x27;re neglecting it, badly.",1403628262

I&#x27;m super grateful to my boss for doing what he can to help me. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ll move much further up here. This project is about as big as it&#x27;s gonna get.

The quality-of-life difference between that country and the US is striking.<p>In Germany, it appeared that ordinary people could both afford to, and were inclined to, partake often in small pleasures such as having a Bier and a bite at outdoor cafes in the summer.  The streets were lined with these cafes and restaurants, most doing a brisk business.  I never saw so many cut-flower shops in my life.  The small pleasure of flowers was both affordable AND something that was on the minds of ordinary people, something that one would never encounter in the US.<p>Here, such things are looked upon as frivolous luxuries, and financially they <i>are</i> that for the 99%.

This would create a halo effect if Windows Phone proved very popular. So far, it hasn&#x27;t.<p>- A lot of people love Visual Studio. A lot of other people don&#x27;t. I like it for C# work. I prefer Emacs for Python, JS and PHP. It&#x27;s also not an option on two out of three major desktop OSs. I find the Android toolset very good for Android development and Xcode is unbeatable for iOS development. For Visual Studio fans, merging Visual Studio with the Android tooling may be a big thing, but for the rest of us, it&#x27;s inconsequential. Most developers I know base their decisions on things other than what is the IDE that&#x27;ll be used with a project.

I&#x27;d like to see some elaboration on that, because platform agnostic is, well, agnostic.<p>- Finally, Microsoft has a lot of B2B clout that allows them to throw money into other divisions until they achieve meaningful market share. However, unless Microsoft finds a way to monetize their Android offerings, they&#x27;ll eventually give up and the phones will have to hold their own. This is an advantage in that Microsoft will offer all kinds of financial incentive to companies who develop for it or sign exclusives. It&#x27;s money in the bank regardless of application or product success. Unfortunately, in my experience (yes - I have dealt with Microsoft) they are not the most generous partners.

Since the points are enumerated, I can refute them:<p>> * You can&#x27;t override a dependency:<p>You can, in modern Bundlers. But the transitive dependency issue is inherent to Ruby, not Bundler. Cargo will work like npm in this regard, not like bundler.<p>> Dependencies can disappear on you:<p>The central repository isn&#x27;t built yet, but this is very valid. The reason that `gem yank` is still available to everyone is that you&#x27;d be surprised how often people push proprietary stuff up to RubyGems. It was removed for a while and caused a significant burden on the RubyGems team.<p>Regardless, yes, this is a serious consideration.<p>> It has weird rules:<p>Totally fair. Let&#x27;s learn from that and make Cargo not have weird rules. :)<p>> * It promotes bad practices:<p>Yup, that&#x27;s a Rails thing. Rust should be way better, as it doesn&#x27;t have this kind of issue.<p>> * It&#x27;s slow:<p>This actually has just as much to do with RubyGems as it does Bundler. See all of the presentations Andre has been doing recently, and the bundler-api project.<p>> * It was designed for MRI:<p>Quite fair. We only have one Rust implementation so far, but `cargo exec` won&#x27;t be necessary.<p>------------------------<p>> So, it should be met with some level of scrutiny.<p>Absolutely! I don&#x27;t mean to say &quot;just take this without complaints.&quot; But without specific, actionable complaints, it won&#x27;t get fixed. Please make as many specific, actionable complaints as possible, especially now, pre 1.0.",1403626645

The whole saving for a mini-retirement is problematic.  Also I have noticed most people don&#x27;t recognize burnout. So that forced time to rest and do something else is more beneficial than it appears on the surface.<p>EDIT: To add. I am becoming more convinced that vacation policy is one of the best proxies that show how much companies care about their employees&#x27; well being and happiness. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am not saying companies should do that. It is up to them. They all will say the do though, but that is one metric that shows if they really do or not.",1403626603

You could get close by running the previous minor version&#x27;s test suite against the new update, but that would essentially make the package repository into a continuous integration server, which is expensive to maintain. There&#x27;s another, less perfect way of detecting API breakage, which is to use the rustdoc tool to export the projects documentation as json. This would let cargo detect whether items had been added, removed or renamed, which covers a large number of cases in which API compatibility is broken. If it encourages developers to up the version number rather than fix the flagged incompatibilities, then it will also drastically reduce the number of incompatibilities in the package repository that can&#x27;t be detected by rustdoc. While it&#x27;s impossible to completely eliminate the human element in upholding the version number contract, software can limit the number of errors in the system.",1403626601

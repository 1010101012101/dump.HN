I just decided to leave my academic career in astrophysics and get a ""real"" job instead, mostly because of the sacrifices academic life demands in terms of relocation (the bad pay doesn't help either...) I've done a lot of coding as part of my research and I hope I have enough skills to land a job.

127157,story,,,20,21,NSX2,"Figure this out and you may have a business.",,"Just got done with this pretty good book on marketing called ""Selling the Invisible"" by Beckwith.<p>Most important thing I got out of it was the points you need to cover to have a complete value proposition to any potential customer; you usually need to cover all points to get people to take their wallets out:<p>We are (who are you?), and we do (what do you do?) for (who cares what you do? who do you serve?) who need (what special needs do those you serve have that they can't take care of without you?).  Unlike our competitors (who are they?), we're different in this way (how so?) and that's important and people care about that because (what's the unique benefit to your difference?).<p>Pretty simple, but how many startups you think can fill in all those blanks?  I'd be willing to bet next week's beer money most people never think it through, from a marketing perspective, past the ""who are we"" part ... maybe the ""what we do"" part.",1204433353

127128,comment,126981,127117,0,0,NSX2,,,"Actually, this illustrates my point perfectly.  By a lot of accounts, Coffee Connection came out with a similar, but much better tasting (""better executed"" as you put it) drink.  But though their execution was better, they got bought out by Starbucks.  Why?<p>Boston is cold as hell in winter and not too hot the rest of the time.  Nobody wants iced drinks when it's cold.  Plus Boston is a small city.<p>California, on the other hand, is a huge state full of teenagers with lots of disposable income and most of it is hot most of the year.<p>So: introduce an iced drink in 1 city in a cold place = not so great idea, not that much money.  Introduce an iced drink in the biggest state in the country where it's almost always hot in most of the state = great idea, lots of money.  So the one with the better idea and the better idea of how to implement the idea (Starbucks) made a lot more money and bought out the business who executed better but executed better on what turned out to be a crappy idea.<p>Starbucks had what customers claim is inferior execution compared to Coffee Connection's version, but their idea was better and their ideas of what/how/where to execute was better.<p>So in the end mediocre execution of better idea = billions in revenue.<p>Superior execution of a mediocre idea = get bought out by above and cease to exist.<p>It's true an architect can't build without builders.  But unless the builders have a good plan, no matter how well they execute, they're just wasting time/energy/resources.<p>Telling someone who's taken the time to come up with good plans/scenarios/alternatives that once the plan is done they add no value is just as much a slap in the face as an ""MBA-business guy"" telling programmers that the second they finish writing the code for an application, they're useless and add no further value unless a change needs to be made.<p>And you can execute perfectly but these days you need so much insight and perspective to be able to detect changes in current and prepare alternate courses of action while managing remaining resources ...",1204430684

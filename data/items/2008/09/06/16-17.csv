They're nice, but they're not $200'000 nice for a marginal increase in power, ability, & a nice body panel design.<p>Plus you can get motorbikes that would beat any ferrari for the same price as a prius.",1220720278

296887,comment,296658,296801,0,0,albertcardona,,,"All the problems you bring up are real. Perhaps the hack-together approach could be rephrased as a screening stage, not a hiring stage. No point in blindly hiring people after testing them with some random, one-day stressful sessions.<p>(It's like scoring students with exams; makes no sense at all, when an informal oral exam would really tell you how much the student knows. Scoring students while having a beer with them may not be conventional, yet my former PhD advisor used that as a pre-screen for hiring new grads.)",1220720030

As for the hardware aspects of scaling: I don't think that people are thinking about hardware much beyond ""more boxes"". My understanding of the hype surrounding ec2 was that it mostly concerned the rich API/management options for configuring your scaling (in software).<p>If you mean that people are ga-ga over how many of Amazon's machines they could scale to but not how they can add layers of caching and database partitioning -- that's probably accurate. IMHO the key point is that Amazon has a generic framework. The architecture you choose to scale with probably ends up being a lot more ad-hoc, ""driven"" by your problem domain.<p>I'm fairly confident that if someone comes up with a rocket-ship approach to architecture that generalizes well for web startups, time and energy will be given over to thinking about it.",1220719693

He rarely makes sense to me, and this column is no different.<p>Microsoft is working very hard to get into the Internet advertising business.  They need a big, technology-centered growth business like advertising to power future growth because they're certainly not going to get it from Vista or Office.<p>If you assume that Microsoft won't block ads from its own ad network, the idea that Microsoft would block Google ads is unthinkable.  Such obviously anti-competitive behavior would bring down the Wrath of Kahn from every government agency in Washington and Brussels.<p>It simply isn't going to happen.<p>IMHO, Google launched Chrome because Google has unlimited resources, a desire to play on the desktop, fuzzy notions about a web OS, and because Googlers just don't know what to do with themselves these days. Advertising is so profitable but, alas, so boring.<p>There's no reason why Chrome won't be successful, but there's also no clear business case for the product at present.

Thus they aren't subject to the same economic forces as Acer (jeez, how can you compare Apple to Acer, anyway...).<p>I'm not an economist but I wonder how much profit they get from positioning as a luxury good and how much from having a unique, single-vendor non-commodity product ""ecosystem"" that includes things like the iPhone, iPod, etc.",1220719181

When you pay extra for a computer... well... you're paying extra.

296875,comment,296062,296094,0,0,Spyckie,,,"It is useful and important - just not to hackers.<p>If you look at the range of MBTI personality types (not that this is hard evidence), there's plenty of people who don't view the world in terms of focus, efficiency, and usefulness. In fact, one of the common differences in the J/P split is that P's like wandering about, being irresponsible, and having things constantly changing around them.<p>The social usefulness comes from the F/T split. To those who are thinkers, the people aspect is often belittled because to them, there is no pleasure gained from communicating with people (but, LISP... now that is a joy to work with!!!). However, to the F types, talking to people is very pleasant and comfortable - much more than writing code in a structured, logical programming language would ever be.<p>Wikipedia says that FP's count for 30% of the population, and FJ's, another 30%. Compare that to TP's or TJs (16%, 24%), and social browse captures a majority market space.<p>Programmers (INTPs and INTJs, mostly), although they are generally more active and enthusiastic customers, account for < 10% of the population. And they are right in that social apps aren't useful or important to them. However, they're a clear minority in terms of user base, and they're picky, disgruntled, hard to keep, and easy to offend.<p>SocialBrowse (and all social apps) may not have value to them, but it definitely has value to the majority of the world. Now, the key is getting off tech blogs and into real world marketing, guys.",1220718923

I'll stick with thinkpads and Toshiba for XP/Ubuntu dual booters.<p>i commented on teh Mark Evans blog that macbooks have one  feature no other laptop under about $1700 has, the DVI out.  That, Time Machine, textmate, iphoto, firewire, a listenable sound card, and a few other features are easily worth $750 canadian.<p>I will say that i've had 4 mac laptops, 2 worked great (G4 powerbook and Macbook), 2 are problematic.  Another powerbook had its logic board replaced 3 x (twice in last 5 months), and i've experienced spontaneous freezes on Leopard a few times when quitting Firefox or textmate.

296866,comment,296658,296658,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I think its obvious someone fresh out of college will have ""excellent algorithmic thinking"" since that's how they spent the last 3/4 years. So in that case you should be spending more time during interviews looking at the more likely areas of weakness, which I'd sum up as ""real-world experience."" If you're interviewing experienced candidates, then you can generally hazard a guess that their areas of weakness are elsewhere (lack of passion, knowledge and experience that hasn't kept up with the state of the art, etc).<p>Interviews are all about probing. They shouldn't be a set of rote questions that you apply to every candidate regardless of background. You should make a guess at what the candidate's weaknesses are, and then push on them, push on them some more. This will also help you learn how well they deal with adversity.<p>Of course, before this, testing is a good way to determine what a candidate's strengths and weaknesses are.<p>As a total aside, I've found that US Customs and Border Patrol (the ones who do ""secondary inspections"") are about the best interviewers out there. They probe so much you end up feeling a little violated.",1220717581
296865,comment,296388,296388,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I'm one of the Cappuccino developers. While this is neat, it's not particularly surprising, and it misses ""the big picture"", not unlike the sort of ""MapReduce implemented in 10 lines of Ruby!"" posts we see so often.<p>It actually highlights several of the reasons we set out to do Cappuccino in the first place (some of which might be offensive to web developers):<p>1. This is minor, but the speed comparison is a little unfair, since the original has 3 times as many photos to scale. Yes, Objective-J method calls have a little bit of overhead, but in profiling a real world application (280 Slides), the message dispatch overhead is not a bottleneck (something like 1%).<p>2. It's 45 lines of JavaScript... plus several hundred lines of CSS. With Cappuccino you don't have to write CSS, ever. Some may see this as a disadvantage, but we don't. No more fiddling with CSS hacks to get it to look right in all the major browsers, which brings me to my next point.<p>3. It doesn't work correctly in <i>at least</i> Firefox 2 (OS X) and IE. Yes, this could be fixed, but it's another thing you (theoretically, and usually practically) don't need to worry about when developing in Cappuccino.<p>4. Cappuccino is designed to scale. The FlickrDemo is a small demo which is just that, a demo. It's definitely on the small side of the types of applications Cappuccino is good for. I'm not bashing jQuery, but I'm honestly curious if anyone can point me to an application  written in jQuery approaching the complexity of 280 Slides.",1220717524

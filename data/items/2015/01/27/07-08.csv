8951954,comment,8947080,8947514,0,0,PhasmaFelis,,,"Still a sword, but not the same kind of sword most people think of:<p>For much of their history, the Roman Legions used a kind of short, broad-bladed sword called the gladius. There were various types across the centuries, but generally they were quite a bit shorter than the swords we see in the movies, sometimes as short as 18 inches from guard to point. This was not a great one-on-one weapon; all other things being equal, a warrior with a traditional long-bladed sword would usually beat a shorter one.<p>But the Legions didn&#x27;t fight one-on-one. They fought shoulder-to-shoulder, leading with big rectangular shields, and thrusting around the side, top, or bottom with the gladius. Quite a few of their of their enemies came from traditions that emphasized personal glory and used big, long swords that needed room to swing. These men had to space themselves out further to avoid hitting their fellows, and so each one would find himself facing two Legionnaires shoulder-to-shoulder. A bigger sword doesn&#x27;t help much against odds like that.<p>(I am not an expert and I have probably got some details wrong; feel free to correct me.)",1422345546

8951941,comment,8947354,8950076,0,0,antirez,,,"Hello, in the last couple of months I&#x27;ve been working on a message queue of the kind you describe, which is, one that is more biased about providing a number of features already built in inside the broker itself, instead of delegating it to the client. I understand the case for the other approach taken by NSQ and other systems, it&#x27;s just a matter of what you want to do.<p>However while my queue project supports persistence, synchronous replication, delayed jobs, at least once and at most once delivery semantics, automatic federation, there is one thing I don&#x27;t support in the list of features you mentioned: ordering. And I believe there is a strong argument for not supporting ordering in <i>certain</i> kinds of message queues.<p>By implementing only a weak form of ordering (approximated wall-clock ordering, so that, usually jobs are served in roughly insertion order) we gain: availability (as in CAP, the system can continue with a single node), latency (even in the case of synchronous replication, you need to care just for a message to be replicated into N nodes, regardless of what those N nodes are), and functionality (the queue can auto-reissue messages after a specified retry-time, so at-least-once delivery is trivial to accomplish for consumers and producers). Depending on how the system is designed, to give up strict ordering also wins you scalability.<p>So I agree about your reasoning but my feeling is that message ordering is a big point that really changes how a message queue is shaped. My bet is that there are many problems where ordering is not needed but all the other features are.",1422345194

You can tell if your self-driving car has a license plate on it and keep lobbying to remove it until they do.<p>>  How long until we hear about them logging the serial numbers broadcast by our tire pressure sensors? Or what about the unique magnetic signature of our vehicles detectable by all the loops already embedded in the road?<p>So it&#x27;s a cat and mouse game. So what? If they want to log RFID tags they have to spend a billion dollars putting readers everywhere, at which point people rip the tags out and the readers are useless. Find some other way (and some other billion dollars) to fingerprint individual cars and people will realize that it&#x27;s profitable to sign up their self-driving car to transport Uber passengers and suddenly tracking the cars is meaningless. And so it goes.<p>> Tampering with NIST, clipper chips, export controls. This is not sustainable, people will eventually tire.<p>All of those things failed. Nobody gets tired of winning.<p>>  Also, the argument sounds very similar to what was said about TSA security theater<p>The analogous thing to not having TSA security theater is not having mass surveillance. You&#x27;re arguing the opposite -- mass surveillance for everyone. You can&#x27;t make the slippery slope argument when you want to start at the bottom.<p>> No, my point is that you can&#x27;t prevent something technically practical while the government operates in secret, enjoying a monopoly on information.<p>Which I&#x27;m not disagreeing with. Government secrets should be aggressively minimized. But once again, governments being transparent to their people in no way requires people to be transparent to their governments. And there is apparently some dispute about what is technically practical.<p>>  That is why warrantless home searches aren&#x27;t extremely common, because it would be impossible to do in secret - old papers have very little to do with it.<p>Which is all we need to do here. Make it so that spying on you requires them to physically enter the space you&#x27;re in so that it&#x27;s only practical to do it according to the rules with probable cause rather than in bulk in secret.",1422345072

For most things your measurement precision matches a model at a much higher level. You can stop at Newton&#x27;s or Einstein&#x27;s equations whenever that fit&#x27;s your view of reality.<p>People use that to extrapolate in the other direction, and assume that because Newton&#x27;s laws can be simulated, you can simulate an atom, thus everything. We don&#x27;t have a view of reality at subatomic levels that says: &quot;this is it and there&#x27;s nothing beyond it&quot;. You don&#x27;t know if your simulation of a brain will show an emergent intelligence if simulated with &#x27;float&#x27;, &#x27;double&#x27; or &#x27;infinite&#x27;.",1422342635

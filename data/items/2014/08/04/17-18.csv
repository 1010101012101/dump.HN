They&#x27;re not really built for swimming around a lot, and instead, favor sitting still for long periods of time because they are conserving their body&#x27;s resources.<p>This is why you can also leave a Betta in dirty water for a long time. I&#x27;m staying with some friends right now who, just this past week, rescued a Betta from filthy water in a long empty dorm room. He was still alive, though, because Bettas have a special organ for breathing actual air!<p>Crazy, eh? I say all that to say this: in the wild, your Betta would be sitting completely still in a puddle doing nothing until a bug hops into the water.<p>Your cat, on the other hand, probably wants to go outside and murder things. Mine sure does...",1407175192

8133097,comment,8131772,8131772,11,0,aestra,,,"> Most people think of fish as somehow lesser than pigs, cows, chickens and other land animals.<p>Fish are harder to keep than people realize. They are sensitive to a lot more things than other animals. Yet most people who get them seem to not know how to take care of them. They kill them either through either negligence or ignorance. It&#x27;s almost acceptable in society to accidentally kill captive fish. My roommate in college kept a fish tank that she put a couple fish she got at the fair and I think she bought a bottom feeder to go with them. Well, she wasn&#x27;t the best at keeping up the cleaning and the tank got quite dirty sometimes. The tank was real nasty and one day she took the fish out and cleaned the tank completely and did a full water change. She put the fish back in and all but one died right away. Apparently you aren&#x27;t supposed to do that? Shock? Change in chlorine? I don&#x27;t know.<p>For some reason looking into the tank and seeing those dead fish really affected me. They just died due to a mistake. If you accidentally killed any other pet (cat, dog) it would be horrific but for some reason because it was fish it seemed like it was just nothing. &quot;Whoopie&quot;<p>Also - this was a really good article.",1407175103

Double-tap on a column of text and it would zoom to fill the width of the screen.  This (and similar navigation features such as swipe to scroll) made mobile browsing preferable to desktop browsing for me, despite the smaller screen.  Fast forward a few years.  Almost every website has a mobile version.  Three quarters of these mobile sites (it seems) disable the devices native zoom.  This makes zero sense.  The device with the three inch screen is the one that needs zoom.  It’s like the authors of mobile libraries are all twelve years old, can hear mosquito ringtones, and read microscopic text while bouncing up and down in the back of a car.  Well, here is some news.

Implicit information like number of Yos exchanged in the last 10 minutes, health of friendship, etc. also contribute.

We&#x27;re slowing working towards improving the design of the internet by taking two steps forward and one back. We build off each other, so you don&#x27;t see huge changes in design overnight. This is no different than any other technology. If I raise someone in solitude, and ask them to design a car, it&#x27;ll be quite primitive. Modern cars improve each year from those prior. Occasionally they misjudge, and take a step backwards, but over time, they improve. It&#x27;s the same with design. If you ask someone that has no experience online to design a webpage, they&#x27;ll fall short.<p>We keep building from what we assume is the best. If a popular site goes with flat design, it leads us to believe flat design might be attributing to their success. So, we try to follow suit with trial and error. If flat design is working for them, maybe taking it to an even more extreme and reducing all images and gradients will leave us even more successful. Or, maybe only some aspects of their flat design are contributing to their success, and it&#x27;s a balance between flat and non-flat elements.<p>Which is best? No one knows. We&#x27;ll try all the possible combinations, and gravitate towards what&#x27;s successful with profits, and with users. You can&#x27;t expect these changes over night. Right now designers are quite sure the future involves more minimal design. The only way to test this is to experiment with different combinations.<p>So, don&#x27;t piss on someone because they try an extremely flat design and it fails. The only reason we know it fails is because they went out on a limb to try it out. Instead, thank them for trying, look towards any aspects of their design that did work, and improve on their failure. I can guarantee we&#x27;re going to have an even better experience browsing the internet 10 years from now. It&#x27;s going to happen because of many designers and developers failing, and few standing on them and succeeding.",1407174494

He eagerly emerged from behind the heater he normally hides behind to swim up to the front of the tank, in the same fashion that he does if I walk past the tank.<p>I often feel guilty, wondering if he would long for a larger area in which to swim, and if I haven&#x27;t merely imprisoned him in his five gallon tank.

If the founders want to offer them to someone else in lieu of pay, they need to buy them back from you first.<p>All the people saying &quot;pro rata&quot; don&#x27;t seem to be distinguishing between options and actual equity.  If you have options, you are offered the opportunity to buy equity in the company at discounted rates.  Investor coupons.  Your equity in the company is the number of shares you have removed from the option pool by exercising vested options.<p>The founders, who have actual equity in the company, are adding 8% of their company to the option pool, which is already at least 10% of the company, less whatever OP exercised out.<p>I assume the freelancer was paid in cash.  That makes the current structure 40% Founder A, 40% Founder B, and 20% option pool, currently 10% allocated to Employee 1, and 10% distributed among employees 2-15.  The proposal puts each founder at 36% each, grows the option pool to 28%, with 6% for employee 1 and 10% for 2-15, and 12% for new blood.<p>Until someone starts exercising those options out of the pool and into actual ownership shares, the founders are still 50-50 in control of the company.  Those options remain just investor discount coupons.  They have some value, which can be calculated.<p>Unvested options are worth less than vested options, because you have to apply a discount rate representing the time you have to wait to use them.  The 4% given up are essentially the 4% from the end of the vesting schedule.  What the founders could do is take the current value of that 4%, and pay that to OP as cash, or apply that amount towards exercise of vested options.  It would replace a larger amount of future options with a smaller amount of current equity, but the current value of the assets remains the same.<p>You don&#x27;t need to consult with a lawyer.  The founders can do the right thing and pay you what they promised to pay you when you agreed to work for them, or they can reneg.

Certainly the complete package has much higher value, to the right buyer, than the domain name alone.<p>Have you been involved in the sale of such a thing before? If so, how did you go about it? Did you use a broker? (If so, can you recommend a good specific one?)<p>Or did you go with cold-calling specific prospects? If so, how did you identify them? Did you contact individual companies?

Last-ditch effort that can&#x27;t really upset too much, especially since you already lost them.<p>Of course it depends on how spammy those popups end-up being, but at least from a couple of sites that I&#x27;ve seen and who use bounce exchange, they do seem to get pretty spammy-looking in my opinion.<p>What I wonder the most is who would actually pay for this. The &#x27;exit intent technology&#x27; as dubbed by bounceexchange can be easily done with a couple of lines of javascript. Perhaps it won&#x27;t be as sophisticated, but it would achieve very similar effect. We ended up borrowing a small snippet from an open-source project[1] that does this and it&#x27;s looking fine so far. All it does it checks if the mouse y-coordinates is below a certain threshold and then triggers the modal.<p>Perhaps the popups themselves and having them pre-designed or having a WYSIWYG editor and integrated without any coding would be a selling point here?

Using instantaneous shutter, considering the speed of sound is very high*, every part of the image is resonating essentially the same sound; the sampling theorem says you can only perfectly reconstruct up to F/2 hertz if you sample at F frames per second. The rolling shutter introduces regular variations at at much higher frequency, allowing much better sampling.<p>- Actually, doing a quick calculation shows that at 1khz a 1/2 wavelength is just 17cm. I wonder how precise spatial scene/source information has to be to allow this diversity to contribute significantly to the sampling. If you had a planar source and precisely spaced two objects it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to increase spectral resolution. The complementary possibilities are also be interesting -- with precisely laid out N objects and a good spectral resolution for each afforded by the shutter you could perhaps resolve the sound into N distinct sources, allowing to determine the origin of the sound; with precisely known source locations you may be able to extract some object location information.",1407173977

When you have hundred thousands of free games, you better come up with a deadly addictive smart buzz generating game if you want to make any living out of it!<p>But then there is also an other point: how people see things. Let&#x27;s take the &quot;To do list&quot; example. None of my friends and coworker are using the same app, they all are die hard fans of their app. That&#x27;s what happens when everybody comes with it&#x27;s vision of how the to do list should be done. You end up with hundreds of app doing the exact same thing and they will almost all find their users, because nobody agrees on what should be the standard. That is inherent to software and human nature, lots of the startups are not creating anything new, just re-implementing their version of something they think must be done differently!<p>That being said, as the number of startup grows and the number of garbage projects/products grow you see also crazy ambitious and life changing stuff emerging. I think the analogy to the gold rush made by an other guy here is very pertinent!

Health care is a basic human right, not a privilege reserved for those who can cough up the sick prices for treatment.<p>- The government should run all medical schools so doctors graduate without debt. You serve for 10 years as payment for the schooling. After this, you are free to pursue other goals.<p>- Pharmaceutical companies should hold no patents, no trademarks. Companies should be merged so their collective brain trust can solve the world&#x27;s medical woes. Non-profit company results. R&D payed for by taxpayer money.<p>I severely dislike for-profit business in general, but more so when medicine is concerned. Human beings always should trump profits. Always. Doctors should become doctors to solve problems, not enrich themselves.<p>Sadly, I have several medical conditions which need repair, but even with insurance, I cannot afford the co-pays, upfront deductible costs, and other sick for-profit BS I would need to meet in order for my insurance to kick in at 100%. I have seriously toyed with moving overseas simply for tax-payed health care.<p>I&#x27;m in IT (non-profit), make OK money, but I refuse to enrich the for-profit system.

Whether it&#x27;s websites that don&#x27;t know how (or don&#x27;t bother) to design with mobile in mind, or websites that do try to design with mobile in mind, and go completely over the top to the point that it ruins UX (Why do we still see websites where you can swipe left/right to switch articles. Does anyone every actually need to swipe through blog posts that rapidly?) It feels like there are very few websites that don&#x27;t outright ruin mobile browsing.<p>And even when you find one of the nice ones, your browser mucks it all up by thinking it is smarter than the web designers. &quot;Font Boosting&quot; makes Reddit and several forums I frequent completely unreadable for me. Even on the mobile versions of the sites! It seems to get worse as you go down the page, and after 30-40 comments, the font sizes might as well have been chosen completely at random.<p>The other day, my phone warned me of low internal storage, and I saw the  Chrome app was taking up 225mb of space on my android, and this is not including the additional 100mb+ from cache and data.

As a resident of SF, I long ago gave up the idea that you could look up the scheduled arrival of a bus and plan around that. However, if a bus is supposed to be running every 12 minutes, that&#x27;s the number you can plan around (or use to benchmark the performance of a bus line). So instead of trying to show how the times compare with the theoretical schedule I think this would be more useful to show how the buses deviate from the planned interval. If I know it&#x27;s a 12 minute bus that means I should never have to wait at any given stop for > 12 minutes. If I&#x27;m standing there for 30 minutes, then the bus service is failing me.<p>It would also be useful to color code the historic tracks based on which trips ended up taking something like >10% or 20% longer than the planned time.

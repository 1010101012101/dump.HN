1032062,comment,1031282,1031360,0,0,shin_lao,,,"I really agree with you about the movie industry and also the music industry. That's because they didn't analyze that copying a movie or lending it to friends is actually a feature.<p>There's also much more to music and movies than just the product. It's Art, it's a way of communication. It conveys cultural and ideological values. People can have a deep and emotional link with a movie or music. Adding ""don't pirate this"" movies and making it hard to share what you love with your friends is really killing what your business is about.<p>Software is different. ISV are actually hurt by piracy. Platforms have died because of Piracy (Atari, Amiga), and most importantly it's possible to protect a little bit from piracy without annoying your users. I think asking for a serial number once or calling home from time to time is really reasonable. It doesn't affect the user experience and protects both you and your customers.<p>Where you are right is when you say you must evaluate how much piracy costs you before doing anything. Copying your software must not be ""trivial"". You want to avoid the situation where it's easier to find a pirate copy than an original one.<p>But spending months adding anti-reverse engineerings features is just plain stupid.",1262677992

1032052,comment,1031902,1032005,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The money isn't my primary problem with buying so many books, though it is a factor...it's the weight of having all those books.  When I moved from Austin I sold 26 boxes of books and several bookshelves.  I promised myself I would never collect that many books again.  I'm moving into an RV this week, and so had to sell all the remaining books (and any that I'd collected since that last move), and I sold 8 boxes of books and three book shelves.<p>Having large piles of things, like books, makes it too easy to slip into a rut and stay in the same place doing the same thing out of mere inertia (more mass==more inertia, and books en masse are heavy).",1262677178

I think he meant ""is this the <i>only</i> reason why we use high fructose corn syrup everywhere"" to which I think the answer is ""no."" There's no shortage of corn subsidies, and farmers have been looking for new ways of utilizing corn for years. HFCS has been one of the ways which has payed off. Additionally, fructose is rated higher than sucrose on the Relative Sweetness Scale (140 and 100 respectively) so that less product may be used.<p>But yes, the above reason is vital.",1262676126
1032037,comment,1030711,1030976,0,0,icefox,,,"Hmm I guess I was being to obtuse from the downvotes.  Having not found the code from the article I was very interested in checking it out when the link was posted here.  Sadly the code is written in such as way that makes it extremely difficult to easily learn anything from.  Reading the code is often the best way to understand how a program/problem runs.  I went to the source to answer the following questions: How is the snowflake generated?  What factors need to be taken into account?  Looking at the code if you want to figure anything you would have to put a lot of time and effort into it.  Badly named variables and function names are just one of the problems.  Take for example 'initialize()', what does it initialize?  Is it only initializing snow flake code, only X11 code, both or just a dumping ground function?  What about the check() function?  What does it check?  and chi()?  There is a shape12, but not a shape6 or shape3 function, why not? What does parupdate do?  What about norminf()?  None of this answers the original questions.  How do I simulate growing a snowflake?<p>If the code was written in a sane way you would be able to skim through it in two minutes and have a good overview of how a snowflake is made.  Given that it would probably take a good hour at least to understand it and I am only so-so interested in learning I wont bother.  This is especially sad given that this is coming out of edu where I would presume that part of the purpose is to teach how a snowflake is grown.",1262675847

To use Bloom's taxonomy learning extends beyond that to understanding, application, analysis, evaluation, and creation.<p>The best tip I can give for learning anything is to get your feet wet. Figure out some tiny project that takes a small amount of time and actually do it. There is a lot of knowledge you can learn from books but most people won't be able to contextualize that information without hands on experience, and hands on experience is where you will get the most of your learning, whether you're learning how to cook, or climb a mountain, or play a guitar, or code in Ruby.",1266584252

This is offset by being somewhat stronger than average in build - a t-shirt that fits snuggle around my chest but falls quite wide around the waist will hide a lot of my excess weight. But these are generally pretty hard to find.<p>The bigger problem is trousers - generally it doesn't matter how fit I am, the size of my thighs (muscle again, played rugby from a young age) will stop any trousers from fitting me properly. Anything that fits around the thighs is guaranteed to be several inches too big around the waist (no, a belt doesn't solve this all the time: ruins cut and comfort).<p>The problem is as much with the attitudes & economics of high street fashion as it is with you. I don't get as frustrated and depressed shopping when I'm in better shape physically but it's still a very unpleasant experience - and that's without even thinking about style.<p>Most people say ""go tailored"" with all the obvious expense and silliness of asking for tailored jeans etc. Buying and adjusting is more realistic if you or someone you know can sew or wants to learn (or maybe affordable professionally). But again, sadly, many high street clothes don't have sufficient build quality or extra material (at least one tailor refused me on that basis).<p>Always seemed to me that there is a business opportunity for providing web-ordered clothes.

1136705,comment,1136404,1136668,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"You're assuming that jQuery isn't fast. In my opinion, especially with something like JavaScript, one of the main reasons one builds upon a library is that the library's functions are faster than one could make independently.<p>jQuery is concerned with speed as far as I'm aware; I see benchmarks for it somewhat often, anyway, and I know it's used at a lot of big sites who are also very concerned with speed and load time and therefore has had a lot of iteration and testing with what methods work best.<p>Of course, if Facebook tested jQuery and found it too slow for their needs, that's all fine and good, but somehow I doubt they have. If there is a specific function that's too slow, there's no reason you can't improve or rewrite that function specifically and keep the rest of the benefits of the library.<p>I just doubt that Facebook came up with something faster out of the blue. In some cases, it is true that highly-optimized and specific code is necessary to get maximal performance. Those cases are relatively few, I think, and usually involve code much lower level than JavaScript. In the case of JS, the code should be optimized to perform optimally across all of the major JS VMs. This sounds to me like something that jQuery's authors would have familiarity with, as they spend all day working on that.<p>jQuery is not an abstraction or extra layer of cruft to bog things down, jQuery is a general-purpose library. It's not like an ORM or a dynamic language that adds a whole new abstraction that didn't exist before. Yes, ORMs and/or dynamic languages are slower, but they're slower because they obscure a major functional piece that still has to be performed (mapping onto the appropriate SQL dialect and memory management, respectively) by the computer. In this case, yes, a human could usually make a better choice than a computer if that human was adequately informed.<p>jQuery is not like that. jQuery is not an abstraction, it doesn't abstract away any major task that the computer has assumed for you. It's just a fast library of commonly-used functions and building blocks. It's frequently tested against new browser releases for compatibility and speed. It's frequently optimized and improved upon. There is a huge community out there on tap for support and there are a lot of plugins for it. It's open-source and easy to modify if your case requires it. There are lots of other people from other places that are making important and great changes to that base at no cost whatsoever to you or your company, changes that you can apply just by installing the new version (in backward-compatible releases, naturally) and magically enjoying this speed boost that some other guy provided your website.<p>I don't see any reason not to use a good open-source JavaScript library. We've used jQuery in this example, but I'm sure it's applicable to many others. I don't understand any business reason why Facebook would want to write something completely from scratch when there are these many frameworks already available. The only reason that I can see why this would be implemented in this way is either developer indulgence or developer ignorance.",1266581535

Only. </i><p>White socks are a lot more versatile than that, unless the scope of ""sports"" is so broad as to include hikes, walking in the park or even having a barbecue.  Wearing dress socks with sneakers is just odd.",1266581451

Once you start wearing suits for different occasions, it's pretty obvious, at least IMHO.<p>A black suit is good for formal use. Church-business, meetings with executives etc. You're conveying the message that you're dead-serious. A charcoal suit works well, also, as mentioned in another comment.<p>A lighter suit, maybe grey with a very light pattern, no color, goes well for anything non-dead-serious. The message is that you respect and take whomever you're with seriously. Lower level meetings, fancy restaurants, conferences. A black suit don't go well here, because the situation just isn't dead serious.<p>The third suit is for when you're used to wearing suits and like it (if you don't like it, don't go there) - something more playful, something like a color pin-stripe is popular. Generally not for business-use, but for going out. If you show up at a post-conference cocktail reception in a suit like that it says ""let's enjoy ourselves"" and shows another side of you.",1266581449

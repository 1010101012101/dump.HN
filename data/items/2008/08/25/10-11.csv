Knowing the exact position and time of the photograph (and therefore the angle of the sun), you could probably get a pretty accurate measure of his height from the length of his shadow... even from a satellite photo.",1219661104

There are two factors you might not be accounting for here: that the transparency of the tab display would make clear that the screen is a temporary one, intended to aid navigation, and that the quasimodal interface, where you have to hold some hotkeys down, keeps transparent navigation overlays from distracting from the browsing. Check out Enso for a live example: www.humanized.com<p>Additionally, the tab display can be scaled down to whatever level the users end up desiring: recall that navigation is done by dragging and zooming.<p>I will admit, I'm coming at this from the direction of 'what is the ideal navigation system', not 'what will, for the immediate term, make the most people comfortable'. I suspect that the system is fairly easy to learn, unobtrusive, and that in time greater efficiency will win out.<p>I agree with your assumptions. In particular, keeping the tabs system on different screens from history is terrible. But I must not fully appreciate your sense that the history gutter will fragment history from tabs. It seems, instead, that since it's part of the same screen, and the same unified system, that it's a step in the <i>right</i> direction. And I think there simply have to be some compromises for people who want their finished tabs done away with. Visual clutter is a <i>serious</i> impediment for many people, me included.",1219659901

Seems like there's no need to learn anything more detailed at all -- the simple views are consistently upheld by Russia's actions.<p>Russia is a great country.

285788,comment,285399,285735,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Your simplistic view of Russia is what happens when you learn some select facts and plug them into a formula that's designed to accommodate Western societies. If every fact  you know about Russia (assuming even that your facts are accurate, which is unlikely if you read Anglophone media) suddenly became true in America, things would certainly become worse. Sort of like if you added garlic salt to ice cream, it would taste worse, and this doesn't prove that garlic salt is bad.<p>For people who want to understand Russia, I suggest learning more about the 90s, and what was actually happening there while The Economist and the rest of them were falling over themselves with praise. It will put into perspective what they're saying now.

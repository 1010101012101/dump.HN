The biggest losers are those who resist it, the winners are those who learn before time and move to something else more productive. The same argument about unions, suppliers, OEM's etc can be applied to manufacturing industry. But delta improvements in robotics have been replacing humans and will continue to. There is little you can do against bit by bit delta automation happening every day. You can't protest against it, you can't stop it. But when look at it in a decades scale timeline you will see it is likely to be changing the whole scenario like never before.<p>Heck in our own industry IDE's have decreasing barrier to entry rapidly. The quality of skills required to write programs today is far lesser compared what it was two decades back.<p>You could argue every point in the world about why the doctors say in a judgement must be final. But that point is true if you prove doctors themselves don't make mistakes. Doctors make mistakes all the time. In fact ordinary down-the-lane doctors years into their practice aren't anymore helpful than what vinod describes them to be.<p>The point he is trying to is not that there would be a massive change tomorrow and doctors will be out of jobs. But automation in this area is inevitable. How many testing labs have lost blood sugar testing business to glucometers? That sort of innovation is inevitable. There is no point fighting it. Human beings will inevitably move to a higher levels in the productivity curve endlessly.<p>If the doctors don't want that to happen, they have to work to be better than machines. Not expect machines to be dumber than them.",1346738360

4473320,comment,4471391,4472353,0,0,robomartin,,,"All of these things are requirements dor a modern society.  They are used by everyone.  Entrepreneurs and businesses are just one class of users.<p>If you travelled in time back to the 1500's you would use whatever infrastructure in place wherever you land.  It isn't any different today.<p>The government didn't create the Internet as we know it today.  Yes ARPAnet was the genesis of what eventually became the modern Internet.  Private entrepreneurs investing massively in both time and money carved out the the modern Internet.<p>The modern Internet would have happened without ARPAnet. Services such as Compuserve and a myriad of BBS's were already carving out that space.  France had an Internet-like system before the Internet.  As things happened the modern Internet evolved from ARPAnet, but I do not, for one second, subscribe to the idea that we owe the modern Internet to the US government.  And much less so that the aforementioned web designer has anything to thank the US government for.<p>We elect officials to run the country, uphold laws and provide agreed-upon services.  And we all pay for the cost of those services (dearly, I might add).  Everyone benefits from this.  That businesses spring up and use the available infrastructure is only natural.  To propose that businesses somehow owe government for the existing infrastructure is preposterous.  Part of the political game is, of course, to pander to the unions, which are very receptive to these kinds of messages.<p>Does Apple owe its success to the Chinese government for putting into place the infrastructure that allowed them to bring the iPhone to market?  I don't think so.  Apple used the best infrastructure it could find in order to meet their goals.  If the Chinese didn't have it they would have gone elsewhere.<p>Do we, then, also blame the US government for not building the infrastructure necessary to compete with China and keep millions of jobs in the US?  Of course not.  But you can't play it both ways.  If the government is the source of our success and achievements then they also get to own our monumental failures.  Examples of this abound: The destruction of the light aircraft industry due to regulations and litigation; the destruction of the automobile industry due to unions; the destruction of our financial well-being as a nation due to over-spending, unnecessary wars, government unions, ridiculous pensions, entitlement programs and, in general crappy partisan thinking on all sides.<p>As degenerate and incompetent as our government has become I fail to see how anyone can think that they can be or are the source of anyone's success unless you work for a union.  Today I heard on the radio that sa government worker is retiring with a pay of $301,000 pension FOR LIFE.  Yes, that guy owes his success to government as I can almost guarantee you that he did nothing to have earned or deserved that pay.",1346737646

4473315,comment,4470318,4471753,8,0,tsotha,,,"The funny thing is the gangs are somewhat orderly.  They used to have offices.  You know, like if the Gambinos had a building in NYC with ""The Gambino Group"" on a big sign out in front.  Members wore lapel pins with their gang's symbol and sported those wild tattoos, so there was never any doubt who was Yakuza and who wasn't.<p>The cops don't care if the Yakuza kill each other as long as it isn't in a big splashy, public way.  A guy could have two holes in the back of his head and as soon as they see tattoos they'll rule it suicide.  The <i>newspapers</i> do the same thing.  Jake Adelstein said he was going to write up a murder and his boss told him ""Nobody cares when a gangster gets killed.  Don't bother.""  The Yakuza are ""outlaws"" in the original sense of the English word - they break the law and also they're not under the protection of the law.<p>They mostly made their money running pachinko parlors, brothels, extortion, and selling drugs.  But are lines they Yakuza can't cross, like killing a member of the general public or a white foreigner.  If they do that bosses go to jail, offices are shut down, soap palaces are raided.  If you got caught killing another Yakuza the penalty used to be two or three years in jail.  If you killed a member of the general public you got the death penalty.<p>Things are changing.  They don't do the huge parades when someone important gets out of jail any more, the younger guys don't get tattoos or wear lapel pins, and many of the offices and pachinko parlors have been shut down.  Murdering another Yakuza carries stiffer penalties (when the cops bother).  You can't go to a public bath if you have tattoos any more.  They're being driven underground.  Personally, I think that will make them more like organized crime in other countries - more violent and more willing to involve normal people.<p>If you're interested in the subject <i>Tokyo Vice</i> by Jake Adelstein is a good read.  So is <i>Yakuza Moon: Memoirs of a Gangster's Daughter</i> by Shoko Tendo.",1346737614

I came to realize that the primary cause is not stress or excess spicy food, but a particular stomach bacteria, <i>H. Pylori</i>, going rogue and attacking the mucus lining of the stomach that protects underlying tissue from the strong acid [1]. <i>For this discovery, Drs. Marshall and Warren were awarded the 2005 Nobel prize in medicine [2]</i>, as it meant that ulcers were curable with the use of suitable antibiotics.<p>However, my doctor (and good friend) insisted that there was no permanent cure for stomach ulcers and they could only be managed by taking acid reducing medication (Prilosec) everyday for as long as I lived. I couldn't help wondering if his information was corrupted by big pharma, who always want to keep you hooked onto some drug or the other. So, I had to use extra persuasion and tact to get him to prescribe antibiotics for H. Pylori elimination (and thus permanently curing the ulcer).<p><i>I'm a bit skeptical that big pharma's tentacles will NOT reach Watson's doctor successors [3].</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer#History</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physiology_or_Medicine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Phys...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/watson_in_healthcare.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/watson_in_healthc...</a>",1346736879

4473235,comment,4471726,4472362,6,0,klodolph,,,"It's funny you switch to Arch Linux, because Arch Linux is exactly the worst example of broken userland that Linus is talking about in the post.  Arch Linux values ""bleeding edge"" over all things including basic usability, and they willfully break compatibility with all other distros even when there is no conceivable benefit.<p>The best example of this is the Arch mishandling of Python 3.  Remember when they decided that ""python"" was now Python 3?  If you are a Python dev, then alarm bells should already be ringing in your head.  This is a BAD decision with no excuses.<p>Python is wonderful because it is very portable.  I can write Python scripts on my Mac and run them on Linux or even Windows without significant changes.  Python 2 and Python 3 are incompatible, and I usually target Python 2 for anything I want to be portable, since Python 2 ships default on OS X and on lots of Linux distros.  This is reality.<p>My Python 2 scripts begin with a shebang, ""#!/usr/bin/env python"" which launches the Python 2 executable, wherever it is installed, on OS X or Linux.  Unless you are running Arch Linux, in which case you need to go in and manually change the script to point to ""python2"" instead of ""python"".  Except ""python2"" is essentially unique to Arch, it doesn't exist on Debian or Fedora or OS X or whatever.  So no portable script is EVER going to point to ""python2"".<p>But there's no real benefit to making ""python"" into Python 3.  Anyone targeting Python 3 will write ""python3"", which works wherever Python 3 is installed, including Arch Linux.  This is the decision the upstream made, and it's a good decision.  Anyone targeting Python 2 writes ""python"", which works everywhere except Arch, and on Arch you have to edit your scripts.  Who wants to keep a separate copy of your scripts for Arch?  What if they're not your scripts?  Do you write a shell script that runs ""sed"" to fix them?  What if you keep your Python scripts in Git or SVN, and don't want to change them every damn time you check out a fresh copy on Arch?<p>Worse yet, lots of Python devs want to install and test with specific versions of Python -- say, the Python version that their servers run.  Arch sabotages this, because as soon as you put ""python"" in your $PATH, a ton of Arch programs break if they target Python 3.  And they wouldn't have broken if they just said ""python3"" in the shebang to begin with.<p>The result is that Arch has to maintain a fork of EVERY Python script in their repository.  For what?  No real reason.  The only conceivable benefit of this terrible change is that a user can type ""python"" in the terminal and get Python 3 instead of Python 2.  I've been doing this for years with an alias in my .bashrc, and it doesn't break every Python package in the repository.<p>So in short, the Arch Linux developers promise a new world in which not only is binary compatibility impossible, but source compatibility for SCRIPTING LANGUAGES is impossible as well.  They have taken a bad idea and stuck to it, dismissing anyone who disagrees with them by suggesting that they use ""sed"" to fix the user's ""broken"" scripts, in such a way that it would break compatibility with every distribution besides Arch.<p>And I have further rants about Arch with respect to (1) their dismissal of bug reports of serious security vulnerabilities in default configurations (2) the dismal performance and general usability of their package manager (3) the inability of their maintainers to create a correct package for something as simple as a font (4) the terrible average quality of advice on their wiki, which is often gives advice that simply doesn't work for well-documented and easy-to-discover reasons.<p>Gawd, use anything else.  Gentoo, even.<p>Okay, I want to rant more.<p>(1) Security vulnerabilities are dismissed with the kind of reasoning like ""users who run this package know what they are doing, and don't run the application on untrusted networks.""  Considering any (non-virtual) network secure is almost certainly a sign of incompetence in your sysop.<p>(3) Install ""terminus-font"", it won't work.  You have to manually ""xset fp"" the path to it.<p>(4) See #3, and then look up the Wiki advice for it.  It just doesn't work if you run e.g. GDM, which doesn't run ~/.xinit.",1346735449

People who think well, write well.<p>Most of this advice applies to coding as well (with some liberties...):<p>1. Read Effective Java / Effective Go, etc<p>2. Use normal idioms of the language, not clever constructions.<p>3. Short variable names, short methods, short classes.<p>4. Don't force ""Patterns"" into your code unnaturally.<p>5. 1000 lines to a file, max.<p>6. Check the APIs you use (at least the docs), that they do what you want them do.<p>7. Don't submit code the day you write it in a fury of creation. Sleep on it and review it the next day, and clean it up.<p>8. Code Review.<p>9. Write clear understandable code, not just code that you fiddled until it compiled and ran.<p>10. Don't just send an email and expect the reader to act.

I publish its source code here, straight from my version control system called <i>.bashrc</i>:<p><pre><code>    alias pass='gpg -o - ~/Important/passwords.gpg'
</code></pre>
The <i>gpg</i> command will automagically use the relevant askpass dialog of the desktop of my choice, which I've set to expire after fifteen minutes. The above command will print a sorted list of entries in this format:<p><pre><code>    site: username
    site: password
</code></pre>
also known as a <i>text file</i> and extracting specific passwords goes by eyeballing the printed output or alternatively applying <i>grep</i> to only extract the stored data for a specific site. The final copying to the web browser happens via manual operation of mouse selection and the clipboard. I get rid of the plaintext passwords by actuating an operation called closing the terminal window.<p>Works just fine! And I got to choose the format of the datastore myself, too!",1346735167

a hash over the loaded block and by then comparing the resulting hash with the on-chip

I'm sure the angel investors who front millions for medical research into a disease get the same rush from their cash as you do, but there is more different between your spending and theirs than magnitude. If you invest in a company you have a legal claim to own part of it, and it's pretty clear that Kickstarter backers own no part of the companies they support.<p>Whether the cash is given in the spirit of altruism or profit-seeking isn't the real question; the question is whether equity is expected in return or not.

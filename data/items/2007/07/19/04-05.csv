35174,comment,35015,35173,0,0,admoin,,,"That works, except then I guess the hole was not making it clear enough that you were talking about utility rather than expected value. The problem with your response, and the reason that I don't really see it as a good explanation, is that your basic principle is far less useful if it requires the user to calculate their expected utility.",1184819029

35171,comment,35015,35041,0,0,pg,,,"Actually not.  That's why I was careful to speak of the effect of trading equity on the ""average outcome"" rather than e.g. ""average valuation at liquidity.""  What I'm literally saying is, does the trade improve your odds of getting what you want? That subsumes both your risk aversion and your utility function for money.",1184818637

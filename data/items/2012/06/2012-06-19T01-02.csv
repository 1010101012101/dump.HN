4129842,comment,4129636,4129802,3,0,zaptheimpaler,,,"Very true. My contention though, is that the bubble we live in is most likely indicative of the future of technology. Especially given the fact that we've been seeing this trend of web-only apps EXPLODING and growing rapidly for a long time now, it looks like its just a matter of time before the average consumer is forced into the same ecosystem.<p>For example, note that the iPhone and Android ecosystems are very much prevalent amongst the average consumer, and they have already accepted the ecosystem that forces them to pay for digital content that they don't really own, or use Google and Facebook when the information they have at their disposal coupled with their privacy policies are making them increasingly scary.<p>It's strange, but I think the tech market is indifferent to violation of privacy or ownership rights. The success or failure is determined by functionality, UI etc. but not legal concerns. We have never before witnessed the creation of online ecosystems of this scope, so its understandable, but ultimately a mistake IMO.",1340071186

They can humanize a problem and create food for thought in a way that no amount of statistics ever could.<p>For example, it's one thing to cite statistics that children of gay parents do just as well as those of straight parents (I have no idea if it's true, but it's an interesting contemporary question). But that's not likely to change the mind of a homophobe on the issue of gay adoption. On the flip side, a lucid, heartfelt anecdote from a person who had gay parents might actually help someone to <i>understand</i> what it's like to grow up in that environment an therefore become sympathetic.<p>Of course, it has no bearing on the actual statistics at all, but sometimes statistics aren't the most important thing.",1340071016

4129827,comment,4128208,4129588,2,0,apaprocki,,,"> In Unix-land, this data type and boatload of library functions is the operating system.<p>Which can lead to problems as well. Basically when dealing with ""local"" time (DST), you need a reliable source of data and the question boils down to whether you want system administrators to keep OSes patched and up-to-date every time tzdata is updated, or whether that should be handled at the application layer.<p>Java chooses to bake in tzdata, and so do a number of other app-layer platforms. JS in the browser relies on the OS instead of bundling binary tzdata. Windows and a few commercial *nix platforms do not bundle tzdata either and maintain their own definitions. The crowd-sourced tzdata has demonstrated itself better than even what Microsoft ships in Windows. I don't know anyone who would claim a dataset other than tzdata is ""better"".<p>There might come a point in time where browsers have sufficiently advanced automatic patching invisible to the end user that they would be better off bundling tzdata internally rather than relying on the OS because they can guarantee their data is better in a higher percentage of cases. It all comes down to whose update system is more seamless and more likely to occur given all the external factors that come into play. (e.g., a user might have local machine privileges to apply browser updates, but not OS updates)",1340070910

4129825,comment,4124320,4129631,2,0,Alex3917,,,"""They can be refuted with sufficient evidence.""<p>Except for that they can't, because everyone who believes in science just says that the reason they believe that science will be able to explain everything is that it has explained everything so far. This is just begging the question, and it's clear that no matter how much evidence there is that there are some things that science can't explain these will just be written off by those who have 'faith' in science. You can go over to r/science or r/atheism and find literally thousands of examples of this.<p>>What reasons? Be precise enough and you get a Nobel Prize and eternal adulation.<p>The obvious one would be that there is absolutely nothing to suggest that consciousness is material in nature. But again, the true believers refute this by listing all the other things that we didn't understand until science came up with some explanation, and saying that therefor science will most likely also be able to explain consciousness one day.",1340070908

Not Apple's computer when I'm using iTunes (hah, as if I'd ever use that piece of crap, but stay with me here), not Microsoft's when I'm using Windows Media Player, not Google's when I'm using Chrome and not Mozilla's when I'm using Thunderbird.<p>I know what I want my user interface to look like. I know what fonts, colours and relative sizes I want things to be. All in exactly the same way that I know what colour I want the walls to be painted in my home and where I want my furniture.<p>By breaking UI conventions because some idiot thinks that he knows what colours and shapes my monitor should display, I am unable to dictate what my own things should look like. Instead of a designer spending his time on designing a theme for a GUI toolkit and skinning all of the applications on my computer at once, he wastes time on coming up with a visual theme for just one of them.<p>Intelligence 101 - tend towards abstraction as much as possible. This recent trend clearly has it's roots in the idiot depart... ahem, sorry, I mean marketing department where the thinking went something like ""but we need to solidify our brand experience by making our application stand out!"". Yeah, buddy, yours and everybody elses. Give me my shit back, provide the functionality I'm buying from you and design a nice theme for KDE or Windows if you feel so inclined.<p>To hammer the point in further with another example, CSS was designed with, err, designers in mind and look at what a head-fuck that turned out to be. Leave the thinking to people who know how to think - we'll tell you what needs prettying up and how to do it right.<p>To throw out an idea of how things could be better - why can't GUI toolkits support fluid designs which can be manipulated by central themes? Why can't some people opt for ribbon menus while others use the old drop down menus just by changing a theme? What about if I want all my menus to be ribbon style but in a vertical fashion? Or if I want that list of porn actresses names' to be on the right rather than on the left of the porn database application I use to track my stalking habits? GUI's should adapt to how the individual thinks as opposed to the other way round as it currently is. <i>That</i> is the smart way to do it. This recent trend in UI's and, frankly, many other things, is taking the stupid approach to the problem.",1340069829

This allowed me to install <i>Remove Activities Button</i>[1] and <i>Applications Menu</i>[2], which combined to replace the rather useless and annoying Activities menu with a standard Gnome2-style applications menu, and get rid of the ugly dash that was stuck to the left of my screen, hogging real estate.  This had the sanity-preserving side-effect of removing the stupid hot corner to Overview that I would accidentally trip every other time I tried to hit the back button in the browser.  It can still be accessed with the Tux/Windows key.  I also installed <i>Force Quit</i>[3], which puts a little 'x' next to the Applications menu.  Click it, then click any misbehaving window to kill -9 all procs associated with it.  Haven't had to use it, but it seems handy.<p>Next, I installed <i>Brightness Control</i>[4], as the fn+arrow keys don't work worth a damn, and <i>Advanced Volume Mixer</i>[5], which replaces the standard volume bar with a separate bar for each app.  I installed <i>Remove Accessibility</i>[6], just to de-clutter, and <i>All-in-One Places</i>[7], to give me some handy shortcuts.<p><i>Quit Button</i>[8] replaces the username ""status"" menu with the familiar options from Gnome2, and <i>Settings Center</i>[9] gives me quick and easy access to a variety of settings menus.  Finally, <i>Frippery Move Clock</i>[10] puts the clock over in the top-right corner, where it belongs.  I'll probably look into installing some workspace-related extensions as I become more comfortable with the system.<p>The combined result of these small changes is a system that I find far more friendly and usable.  As I said above, the only thing I find wrong with Gnome3 is the defaults.  Gnome Shell is incredibly extensible, and <i>absolutely gorgeous</i>. It now works for me like a cross between Gnome2 and OSX, with some handy extra features thrown in.  Some of these changes are fairly major, while others are tiny tweaks, but I love how simple and easy they are to experiment and play with.  Most changes are instant, and enabling/disabling extensions simply involves flipping a toggle switch on the extensions web page.

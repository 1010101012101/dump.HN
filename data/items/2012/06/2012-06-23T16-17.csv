(Also why I'm reading it again)<p>However, surprisingly, I couldn't find any good opposing analysis to his book.  Maybe because it's too newly published.  But, the ones that I did find, seemed to appeal to authority: That Graeber wasn't an economist and was only an anthropologist meant that he didn't really get it.  I didn't find those arguments particularly useful.  If you can lead me to other materials, I'd be happy to read them.  I'm still trying to make sense of it, myself.<p>Anyway, I can see why you took away what you did.

I mean, sure, this is a hell of a lot nicer than fighting a war of that magnitude; I'm very thankful that I've never been in a situation where another human was seriously trying to kill me (and I've never been in a situation where I needed to kill another human, which, from what I hear, can often be more stressful and mentally damaging than being in a situation where someone else is trying to kill you, assuming you survive.) but... it just seems weird to me that the European community would let Germany reunite, then that they would almost voluntarily place them at the head of the European government.<p>How do Europeans feel about this?  I mean, is my view of ""give me the courts and the money supply, let the rabble have the rest"" just not shared by most Europeans?<p>Is there a fear in Europe that Germany is taking over?  I certainly haven't seen any of that in media coverage;  but I would guess there would be some reluctance to express such feelings out of fear of appearing nationalistic or racist.

4151152,comment,4150539,4150723,12,0,fpgeek,,,"First, it doesn't matter if Microsoft's ""platform support"" was contingent on giving up other options. There is one and <i>only</i> one circumstance under which a company like Nokia should be willing to give up their strategic flexibility like that. And that's if Microsoft were willing to acquire them (then-and-there not a few years later when they're cheaper).<p>Nokia's market cap was over $38B at the end of 2010. It was just under $32B at the end of Q1 2011 (after the ""burning platforms"" memo). It is under $9B today. As you note, not all of that is Windows Phone, but plenty of it is. Microsoft's $1B/year is peanuts. To put it another way, how much was avoiding the ""Nokia rejects Windows Phone"" headline worth to Microsoft? Plenty more than $1B/year, I bet.<p>Second, Nokia's feature phone business is one big reason to have an Android project going. Low-end Android phones are one of the big things eating feature phones. Until recently, Nokia had been spending plenty of effort (e.g. Meltemi) trying to create something to compete with Android at the low end. They shouldn't have been re-inventing the wheel. They should have picked up Android and leaned on some of their other strengths (e.g. manufacturing, distribution, etc.) to win low-end devices.<p>Third, I don't think Qt is a magic elixir. Establishing a Qt ecosystem easily might not have worked. But it was a way to transition off Symbian without immediately deprecating those devices (and we saw how immediate deprecation turned out). And it was a decent story to tell developers: ""Build with Qt and you can make your app available on every mobile platform you care about (except maybe Blackberry)"".  Of course the devil is in the details and it wouldn't be that easy, but plenty of developers want a cross-platform mobile story. It could have been the hook that got an ecosystem off the ground, so it was at least worth trying. And if it didn't work, you'd have been offering devices from each of the alternative platforms you could consider. It would be a lot easier to pick if you could see how those devices were doing in the marketplace.<p>Fourth, the measure of success of including Android (and I'll emphasize again that I didn't say don't do Windows Phone, too) isn't whether they would have remained profitable while doing so. It is whether they would have had better options today and would they have lost less money along the way. I think the answer is obviously yes on both counts. If nothing else, being able to point to a more successful Android line and a less successful Windows Phone line would have driven up their eventual acquisition price.",1340468887

Now, WP is seriously behind in the market and they desperately need a first-tier vendor dedicated to them (Huawei is relatively unknown, HTC is struggling, and Samsung's are an afterthought to the money-printing Android based SGS line), so Microsoft needs Nokia's clout as much as Nokia needs MS's cash.

Both are non-IPS. I recently picked up a Lenovo 12.5 HD IPS screen which is lower DPI than either the mac or the dell. However after using the lenovo for a couple of days I'm blown away how shitty both the mac and the dell screens looked (dull, like someone had put a film on top). Given many applications are not ready for retina display, apple could have used their supply chain prowess to get an IPS display on their regular macbook pro line.",1340467531

You can read on your US dollars that they are issued by the federal reserve. An excellent measure of the money supply is NGDP, since this is the number of dollars traded every year (that sort of quantifies how many dollars are available to be captured by working, trade, etc.). Unfortunately, in 2008, the US Fed decided to adopt an ultra-tight monetary policy, resulting in a severe drop-off in NGDP relative to previous trend (the worst since the Great Depression, graphs here: <a href=""http://marketmonetarist.com/2012/06/19/guest-post-measuring-the-stance-of-monetary-policy-through-ngdp-and-prices-by-integral/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marketmonetarist.com/2012/06/19/guest-post-measuring-...</a>)<p>It does not look like it will ever recover to the previous trend, so the money supply is much smaller than people would have expected before 2008. In theory, the nominal value of money shouldn't matter in the long run. However, since people before 2008 signed contracts (read, 30-year mortgages) anticipating a much higher aggregate money supply, this has triggered a shortfall in demand ever since, which has left our economy in the tank.",1340467443

I'll probably never have the opportunity to hire such a person, so when I interview I look for competence and learning potential (curiousity, humility, ...).<p>Also, I regard programming as a maximally innovative field. There's no reason in principle to do the same thing more than once in programming, and the practical reasons all seem to derive from a combination of mistakes and misfortune.",1234015041

471109,comment,470927,471087,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"Javascript's design owes a lot to Self. Modifying an object's slots in realtime was pretty much the whole point of Self and what lead to the concept of a prototype language. (Well, technically, I think Self was simply an implementation of the already-existent prototype language idea... but is an idea actually useful before there's an implementation of it to test theories with? Chicken-egg... :))<p>The DOM (as in Document Object Model defined by W3C) has nothing to do with Javascript - it's just an API originally designed for accessing the various parts of HTML. It was set up so that it could be implemented for almost any language. In fact, had it actually used some of the more advanced (Self-inspired) features of Javascript within the definition of the DOM, the DOM may not have been such a pain in the ass. :)<p>What Javascript did manage to do that was very important is that it ended up becoming not only the most installed programming language of all time, but unlike BASIC, it's actually a pretty damn good language under the covers. So if anything, the fundamental innovation of Javascript within every browser has basically yielded another BASIC-like inspiration to a whole new generation of programmers. Except this time, their intro language was much more abstractly powerful.",1234013803
471108,comment,470084,470231,0,0,patio11,,,"I once worked for the mail order arm of an office supply store which you all know.  We have the same distribution-centers-across-country-situated-for-maximum-deliverability system that Amazon does.<p>All the company literature says something to the effect of ""Order by 3 PM EST and your item will be shipped to you in two business days!""<p>This is, not to put to fine a point on it, a lie.  97% of orders put in by 5 PM EST will arrive the next business day.  We expect that.  We're '($# fanatical about achieving it -- if that number slipped to 95% heads would roll at several places in the company.  But we never, ever tell customers that.  Why?  Because if we told them that we'd be pissing off 3% of our customers for forever.  As it is we please 97% for forever.  Much better deal!<p>This lie has some interesting consequences when a customer calls to expedite an order.  (For example, ""Oh crikey, I was supposed to have this order in days ago but I forgot, if it isn't here by Thursday I'll lose my job -- what can you do for me?"")  Our line representatives -- that was little $10 an hour me -- are given, have, and use the authority to upgrade customers' shipping at our discretion.  So I could look at the big blinking count-down clock to 5:00 PM, note that there were 6 hours left to the cutoff, and say ""Oh, no problem ma'am -- this will be there tomorrow"".  But that would spill the beans!  So instead I'd say ""I tell you what I'm going to do ma'am, I'll upgrade you to our fastest available shipping through FedEx at no extra charge.""  And then proceed to cost the company about a day's worth of my salary, just to avoid losing face in front of someone who I'm busy wowing the daylights out of.<p>I cost the company substantially more in ""accommodations"" than I did in salary for at least some of my tenure there.  The computer flagged me for it twice.  My line manager came to me and said ""Hey Patrick, the computer has flagged you for being overly generous.  Anything you want to tell me?""  and said ""I felt that accommodation was necessary knock the socks off of [customer name]"" and my boss said ""Right answer!  Carry on.""<p>Which is how you get a 99.X% customer satisfaction metric for the quite pedestrian business of selling paper and pens out of a catalog.  (Quite profitably, I might add.)<p>I'll take the liberty of keeping the company anonymous and slightly altering the above internal metrics.  They always treated me well and that buys a lot of loyalty.  So if you need to buy your office staples, well, you'll just have to find your own preferred service provider.",1234013733

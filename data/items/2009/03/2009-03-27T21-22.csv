535757,comment,535479,535479,0,0,fireteller,,,"(I can't see any of the 11 comments so forgive me if post is redundant in some way)<p>Visual Effects production often needs lots of computing resources for rendering.  This is a task that can be heavily parallelized. Usually this is done on a frame/per core basis, with memory being the limiting factor.  Now I've started using EC2 recently which made me realize a different approach to rendering tasks.<p>Normally a facility has a fixed number of CPUs available to run jobs.  So for example 100 cpus.  Let's say the average number of frames to render is usually around 200. So if each frame takes an hour to render and your's is the only job on the queue then it will take 2 hours to see the complete shot. And it's much worse in the real world with many artists working on many shots.  Whereas using a resource like EC2 you can always render your entire shot in 1 hour regardless of the number of frames. You're only limited by the time it takes 1 frame to render, and the cost is the same if you use 1 cpu or 200.<p>In other words one can trade depth for breadth.  Now this may seem obvious to anyone familiar with EC2, but for me it means that tools like Tesla which where once in high demand for this type of work are now much less valuable.  I would expect that it's price/performance is much better then EC2, but where is the cutoff?  How many hours do you have to run that Tesla to come out ahead?  And if you're running 1 Tesla for that many hours, might it not be worth a premium to get your answer sooner by running more massively parallel (but for less wall clock time) on an EC2 like service?<p>I suspect these types of tools becoming only relevant to real time applications (due to reduced latency vs. EC2), and or nonstop computing (assuming there's a big price/performance win).",1238190422

535735,comment,533864,534682,0,0,time_management,,,"There would still be bubbles without the douchebags, but the douchebags made the human costs of this economic cycle far greater. It's douchebags, after all, who have created the collection of trends known as ""middle-class squeeze"".<p>The Clinton regime had an expansion and a recession. So did the Bush regime. Neither leader nor political environment was able to alter the underlying business cycle. But, under Clinton, we had an unprecedentedly prosperous expansion and a mild recession; under Bush we had a shitty expansion (""jobless recovery"" into 2004) and a devastating recession. Douchebags, enabled by the lax regulatory climate, had much to do with this change. Although there are certainly plenty of douchebags on both sides of the political aisle, the fact is that a Republican political and economic culture is more douchebag-friendly. Douche Czar Erik Prince, for example, thrived in the Bush administration.<p>Douchebags aren't responsible for the fact that a bubble occurred, but they influenced the character of it greatly, and magnified the human cost immensely. Most notably, there is the fact that this bubble was in real estate, a type of investment that appeals greatly to the status-driven douchebag mind. (If you don't consider house flippers and real estate speculators to be vintage douchebags, you're seriously out of touch.) A bubble in real estate has a monstrous human cost, whereas one in gold is relatively irrelevant to most people.",1238188860

4520141,comment,4519228,4520077,9,0,luu,,,"There are two reasons I disagree with you. Let me start with the one that has some chance of changing your mind.<p>I believe that spending on education is positive sum. That surely isn't always and everywhere true, but I believe that it's true at the margin, considering the conditions in the U.S. The book that originally convinced me of this was _Children as Pawns: The Politics of Educational Reform_, by Hacsi. It details, along with a lot of other evidence, a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (which is very rare in educational policy) which shows a positive benefit from additional education spending (admittedly, of a very specific type, and in one particular context). There's no way to provide a good summary of the evidence in the book, so let me just say that my opinion is that while the evidence is tenuous, the overall weight of the evidence indicates that the gains from education in tax revenue are greater than the costs. If you like, you can check out the book and decide for yourself. If you agree, then government funding of education seems like an obvious solution. And, of course, the overall gains to society are much greater than the increased tax revenue.<p>I don't mean to say that our educational system is particularly good. In fact, I think it's very inefficient in many ways. That doesn't preclude the previous conclusion, though.<p>The second reason is that, in the model above, college administrators capture much of the value added by subsidies. Some gain goes to ""good"" students, and ""bad"" students are severely penalized. I believe that's apparent from looking at the practical results, and you can see that in the model by adding student ability and graduation rate to the simple model above. You get an even more extreme result if you add types of degrees (hard vs. easy, with hard degrees resulting in more compensation. Typing out the entire ""proof"" would be tedious, but I can do it, if you disagree with the result of the model, given the premises. But, in the end, this is a philosophical difference. I don't think that we should be subsidizing college administrators (who are already much better off than average) and really good students (who, on average, will do fine in life anyway) at the expense of bad students (who, IMO, could use some help). I understand that a lot of folks would prefer that people are rewarded purely on talent. Having subsidized loans with a random probabilistic outcome magnifies that, so perhaps you think that solution is fair and just. If that's the case, and you're not convinced that spending on education is a net positive, then there's no hope my line of reasoning will convince you, and we'll have to agree to disagree.<p>I agree that incentive compatible solutions are important, but I don't think that creating a system that's efficient (in the sense that an econ 101 student would use the word) is the only thing we should consider.<p>P.S. Your original comment has been downvoted, but it wasn't by me. I disagree with your position, but I don't think you're arguing in bad faith or presenting even presenting a fallacious argument, which are the things I would downvote someone for.",1347598746

The consequences of high societal inequality are reasonably well documented. Negative effects of high inequality include but are not limited to higher rates of obesity, incarceration & drug use, and lower rates of life expectancy, social mobility and educational performance.[1][4]<p><pre><code>    In addition to affecting levels of trust and civic
    engagement, inequality in society has also shown to be
    highly correlated with crime rates. Most studies looking
    into the relationship between crime and inequality have
    concentrated on homicidessince homicides are almost
    identically defined across all nations and
    jurisdictions. There have been over fifty studies
    showing tendencies for violence to be more common in
    societies where income differences are larger.[1][3]
</code></pre>
Furthermore, lower levels if inequality are correlated to an increase in sustained periods of economic growth, both among developing as well as developed nations [2].<p>>> <i>2)Of course, there is the possibility that someday automation completely eliminates all workers leading to a destitute class, or overpopulation overtaxes the food supply, but all evidence points to supreme adaptability of people to overcome these problems, so on the balance of probabilities I take it as a given that the same progress will continue. Optimism, arrogance or idiocy - people would accuse this view of all three, depending on their viewpoint.</i><p>Reasonable people can agree to disagree on this point.<p>>><i>3) It often gets missed that when automation occurs, even the people who lose their jobs often get access to the product of that automation at a cheaper price than before, and in the long run are better off once re-employment is found. The classic case is the buggy whip maker, who, despite losing their livelihood, is eventually able to afford the Model T that put them out of business.</i><p>You will find no argument from me that the economy has thus far been able to re-allocate labor assets reasonably efficiently.  The key to the above is not the availability of new goods (the Model T), but the ability of the laborer (buggy maker) to secure re-employment having been made obsolete.  You mention it as a given, however this is not necessarily the case.<p>Since this ultimately ties back to point #2 above, we can agree to disagree.  I personally view current trends as being volatile enough to make direct comparisons with the past highly unreliable as markers for future prediction.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality#Effects_of_inequality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality#Effects_of_in...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/iiahr2001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/iiahr2001.pdf</a><p>[4]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit_Level:_Why_More_Equal_Societies_Almost_Always_Do_Better"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit_Level:_Why_More_Equa...</a>",1347597151

There's just no room to satirize something this ridiculous.<p>For Apple to maintain its market-leading brand prestige and profit margins it has to be hands-down <i>better</i> than the competition and no matter how much heavy breathing hype you want to shower on them the last two iPhones have been predictable, incremental upgrades that in some important ways are actually playing catch-up to the competition. Good, but not good enough.<p>Steve's most successful keynotes were noticeably devoid of this kind of Las Vegas showroom trickery.",1347595433

4520007,story,,,1,2,alid,"Ask HN: The best way to track performance?",,"Hey guys, Id love your help to save me from re-inventing the wheel  whats the easiest way to track and analyze all business metrics in one place?<p>Currently I use Google Analytics for web and Excel & Powerpoint for financials and marketing, with dashboards and a traffic light system for things like target vs actuals. Pretty standard stuff. I can manipulate Excel to analyze databut I dont enjoy it, its time consuming, prone to human and formulaic error, its not realtime, and Id like a s*xy interface where I can tick the box to produce results. Obviously every business has unique key metrics, but Im looking for a system that has a large universe of formulae already built in, which can be applied to my own data at the click of a button.<p>For example, if I want to look at virality I choose the dates, click the Virality button, and there it is. Then with a click I can overlay that with the activities Ive done that week to induce virality (referral program, social media, advertising or whatever). Then I choose to overlay that with churn rates, and then finally I overlay it all with revenue for that period. What a nice little snapshot. Then I can choose to compare all that with, say, 4 months prior. Sweet. The results can be easily shared, and with a click I can choose to look at percentages/real figures/graphs. And Im right-brained so would love it to have color and classy UX.<p>Suggestions would be awesome. Cheers!",1347595319

It's absolute, not relative poverty that concerns me  - definitely it's fashionable to hate on billionaires at the moment and I understand that, but don't subscribe to it.  It's true that the inventor/owner/beneficiary of newly-automated industries accrues a large amount of wealth, but generally this wealth is either put back through into new ventures through investment, higher purchases or even philanthropy.  This is self-evident in Silicon Valley, which has been operating a virtuous cycle of the beneficiaries of breakthrough technologies both spending it on themselves, re-investing in new businesses and giving it away to charities.<p>2) I don't really put any credence in Malthusian scenarios where the long-term ability of humans to improve their lives suffers a sudden and irreversible decline, so I can't agree on that type of point.  The reason I don't put any credence in these is because they've always been popular, but never have been true.  Of course, there is the possibility that someday automation completely eliminates all workers leading to a destitute class, or overpopulation overtaxes the food supply, but all evidence points to supreme adaptability of people to overcome these problems, so on the balance of probabilities I take it as a given that the same progress will continue.  Optimism, arrogance or idiocy - people would accuse this view of all three, depending on their viewpoint.<p>3) It often gets missed that when automation occurs, even the people who lose their jobs often get access to the product of that automation at a cheaper price than before, and in the long run are better off once re-employment is found.  The classic case is the buggy whip maker, who, despite losing their livelihood, is eventually able to afford the Model T that put them out of business.",1347595285

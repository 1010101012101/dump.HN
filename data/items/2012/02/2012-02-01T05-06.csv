3536902,comment,3535727,3536810,2,0,JoshTriplett,,,"OpenJDK has become the official JDK/JRE at this point (see <a href=""http://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/entry/moving_to_openjdk_as_the"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/entry/moving_to_openjdk_as_th...</a> for an official statement to that effect from an Oracle developer).  The proprietary JDK/JRE represents legacy software.<p>As for the rest: you keep re-explaining what you want, but thankfully that won't make it happen.  You can try to build a community around such restricted code, but FOSS has progressed more than far enough that restrictions of the form you suggest simply can't gain enough traction to take hold; you'd have to build a community from scratch, in the face of an openly hostile immune reaction from the FOSS community.  More importantly, by adding such restrictions you remove several of the mechanisms the FOSS community has to protect itself from various critical failure modes, which makes such a scheme inherently doomed to fail in the first place.  In a way, the reaction you'd get from the FOSS community comes from that community knowing that such a scheme can't work, and wanting it to fail quickly before it causes more of a distraction.<p>Among many other reasons, FOSS can't succeed when tied to a single privileged upstream vendor.  Development of good ideas requires a community that can make changes the upstream vendor never thought of and doesn't immediately approve of, and any scheme that requires a license from the upstream vendor can't support a community like that.  Such a scheme would also create a fragile community that the vendor could destroy at any time.  Ironically, the possibility of forking a project and running with it in a different direction helps avoid fragmentation and prevent a variety of standard failure modes for a development community.<p>The FOSS community has numerous examples of successful forks, where the project just moved entirely to the fork and ignored the now-irrelevant original, and would otherwise have just died or stagnated indefinitely.  A very short list of examples: Jenkins (forked from Hudson by the people actually working on it), LibreOffice (forked from OpenOffice.org by the people actually working on it), Xorg (forked from XFree86 by the people actually working on it), cdrkit (forked from the last FOSS version of cdrecord before the maintainer became even more visibly insane than previously demonstrated), EGCS (forked from GCC at a time when GCC had utterly stagnated due to excessive centralized control, and became the new GCC because all the development moved there; we could use a repeat of that right about now).<p>Take a look at <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/282261/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Articles/282261/</a> , <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/246381/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Articles/246381/</a> , and the various things Linus has written about ""commit access"" as a broken model.  You can't have independent development when everone needs a license from one vendor, and you can't have FOSS without independent development.  You certainly couldn't have a world where numerous companies, even competitors, can all cooperate in the same community and produce something useful.",1328075990

Major improvements since 1.4.<p>Even though the main use case for Bootstrap seems to be for rapid prototyping, any thoughts on using it for a production app (but perhaps custom-themed), instead of rolling a custom design altogether?  It seems Bootstrap has matured to the level that it can be used as for most projects with little customizations if any. A lot of what I read in the comments imply that Bootstrap is great at prototyping an app and once that phase is over, you throw it all out and start developing a custom design based on what has been prototyped. Why can't one just stick with Bootstrap and customize it as needed?",1328075080
3536871,comment,3535727,3536454,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"I don't simply suggest ""enterprise licensing"" where a stipulation of a huge 5000-seat adoption is giving IT a copy of the source or whatever. I suggest a template like the GPL that can and will be used by many developers to include a copy of the source with every copy of the binary with the stipulation that the persons who do not own a valid license cannot legally use the software (in either source or binary form). This would allow the developer to continue to make money on software licensing fees, which possibility the GPL entirely upends in practice, and it would allow the end user to read and modify the code their system executes and share their changes with other end users.<p>Enterprise deals that include source usually do not allow the recipient to publish modifications to the code and come with a variety of other very serious restrictions.

So people increase the price for live events. Other people pay them. The world changes. Life goes on.<p>I mean, what do you want? Time to stop? Progress to end? Change to be abolished? This isn't actually a joke. Lots of people with a vested interest in the current extent of intellectual property rights are going to absolutly insane lengths to ensure that a changing society isn't allowed to roll back the extent of IP rights to make them more harmonious with the needs and reality of the present day.<p>But those people can all go to hell. They're the same backwards looking people who said ""but what about property rights"" when it came to freeing slaves. ""Property rights"" were also applied to wives and daughters, and you can just imagine how much consternation was caused when (horrors!) wives and daughters were given the vote.<p>Property rights are ultimately about controlling others. They're good and necessary in limited circumstances, like keeping unwelcome individuals away from our bedrooms and out of our bank accounts. They're absolutely horrifying when extended to the theoretical maximum. Indeed, the very definition of a totalarian state is one in which all people are the property of the State. At some point, between this and anarchy, there's an optimum. As life changes, this optimum point will move. Some will fight these moves and make life miserable for others rather than suffer change themselves, but if the change is big and clear and beneficial enough, most will peacefully adapt.<p>I recognize that rapidly evolving ideas about what should and should not be considered property aren't easy for those whose careers are caught in the flux. Believe me, I'm one of them. At the same time, I see Change as being - on balance - a very healthy thing, even if it makes my own life harder than it might has been in a more static environment. Others aren't so sanguine. They really hate Change. But there's some good news for them too; one day, they'll die, and Change will no longer be a problem for them.",1328074605

Do you build your game to support ALSA, or OSS, or Pulse Audio, or all three?  (I'm not a Linux dev so these examples might not be technically right but it's in the spirit of my point.)  Do you use the dependencies present on the system or include your own?  Does the user have good drivers for their hardware?  Do you target OSS or proprietary drivers, or both?  Often proprietary drivers have showstopper bugs on Linux that take forever to get fixed, if they ever do.<p>When your Linux customer complains to you that your game doesn't work on their version of the ATI proprietary driver, what do you tell them?

One of the major problems with taking an application implemented on a PaaS solution to production scale is that you essentially join at the hip the continued success of your core product to the eventual fate of an outside vendor's platform. What's worse is that by the time you realise you've grown too big for the PaaS you may have to expend a huge amount of engineering effort and customer good will to move off, if you even can.

I'm all for being vigilant, but but there's nothing compelling Dropbox to madly scramble to (as the author puts it) ""pass muster under the new regime"".<p>But what new regime? I'm not totally sure what the basis is for claiming that the old-line industry _just now_ went after MegaUpload because of their legitimate features. Sure, shutting down MU is done on behalf of the interests of copyright owners, however vested they may be . . . but just because SOPA/PIPA (regrettably) come close to passing through Congress and this, truly, seems to betray the pull that RIAA/lobbyists exert over legislators does not also imply that - suddenly! - copyright owners control the government. Cf. ""The U.S. government. Government in league with old-line corporate elites."" U.S. Government? Which part? Which law? Since when? Which you know about . . . how?<p>And E-Mail?? That seems absurd. It's not as though your ISP garners revenues from you e-mailing a track to your girlfriend - ie, the basis on which your e-mail service would be disqualified for the DMCA safe harbor exemptions . . . not to mention that it seems an <i>exceptionally</i> remote likelihood that they'd even have knowledge of the e-mail you sent.<p>Just pause and notice how incredibly <i>top-down</i> for lack of a better term, the author's path to his conclusion really is. What only slightly less obvious is the implied conspiracy and obvious legal ignorance: ""...the gigantic protest against legislative moves (SOPA and PIPA) that would smash the Internet turned out to be superfluous. The thing everyone wanted to prevent is already here."" What?! I didn't see the laws change; all I really see is an egregious violator, a couple of trumped-up conspiracy charges with not much to them (sidenote: piling on grounds for action is standard practice), and an organization picked on for the immense and immediate unlikability of its CEO (Kim Dotcom). To say nothing about the differences between MU and Dropbox.<p>On that note, we're forgetting the evidence cited in Megaupload being shut down. This is referenced elsewhere, but there's a mens rea (state of mind / intentionality) requirement for infringement to rise to the level of criminal law. Ie, the reason why MU was shut down with a criminal action, etc. For another, it's not even clear that banning U.S. users would actually keep flagrant DMCA violators from breaking the law anyway.<p>The DMCA is working. Er, rather: it does a pretty good job of balancing what content hosts (Youtube, Scribd, Reddit, etc.) can do to keep functioning and continue doing what they're doing today, while leaving intact pretty good rules prescribing the means for that ""old-line"" elite to take content down.<p>Contrast this with<p>>SOPA/PIPA on the one hand, which is a comic and internet-autistic attempt for media co. to replace the current, working equilibrium we have with a way for them to call the shots on how the internet <i>functions</i> and<p>>MegaUpload on the other, from whom those enforcers already had found e-mails: not about the manner in which to address DMCA takedown notices, but rather explicitly writing e-mails outlining how/when <i>not</i> to do it.<p>Just remember, the charges being piled on megaupload right now don't have scant evidence or case law, or fall squarely under that class of things which smart/conscientious content providers would <i>NEVER</i> do. Sure, the instant reproducibility of digital content and flat ability for people to do so has <i>CLEARLY</i> outstripped that understanding of copyright law that was devised a couple of centuries ago . . . and, probably against their own interests, folks like the RIAA would like to see the clocks reset to those old days.<p>But MegaUpload being shut down seems more likely a show of how easy it should be to NOT get shut down, than it is any kind of trend for Box.net to be next. Let's not exaggerate the portability exposed by some kind of megaupload-styled ""19th Century is back!"" generic censorship strategy, ok?

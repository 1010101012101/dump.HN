There was simply no conceptual framework in place to ask the question, “Aren’t you Caucasian?”<p>This sounds a little silly to me. From the way European and Arab chroniclers describe the Mongols and their appearance, it seems that people back then had a more than robust enough system of racial categorization to separately classify East Asians. More likely Taiwan was simply such a remote, alien place to Europeans that almost none of them  had sufficient first- or second-hand knowledge to call Psalmanazar&#x27;s bluff.<p>In fact, I suspect that the quoted sentence expresses the author&#x27;s primary motive for even writing this piece in the first place; namely, to argue - contrary to the entire field of population genetics - that categories like &quot;white&quot; and &quot;Asian&quot; are wholly arbitrary social constructs and that races (or at least white people) don&#x27;t really exist.",1430883310

9496451,comment,9495493,9495493,0,0,jameshart,,,"The very first programming text editing interface I ever used was the ZX Spectrum&#x27;s BASIC editor. The Spectrum had a peculiar modal entry system, where entering any keyword was always a single keypress. The keyboard had all the BASIC keywords written on and around the keys (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#/media/File:ZXSpectrum48k.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#/media/File:ZXSpect...</a>).<p>As you typed a BASIC command, the cursor would switch between being a flashing &#x27;K&#x27; (keyword entry mode: the next key you press will enter the white keyword on that key), or in expression entry mode, a flashing &#x27;L&#x27; (lowercase letter entry) or &#x27;C&#x27; (capital letter entry). Other keywords were accessible using the &#x27;Symbol Shift&#x27; key (to enter the symbols or function names in red on the key caps), or by pressing symbol shift and shift you could put it into &#x27;Extended&#x27; mode and enter the red or green keywords above or below the keys.<p>The upshot of this was that Spectrum BASIC never had to lex code outside of basic expression parsing - and the only ASCII lexing it had to handle was expressions containing literals and variable names. Any keyword token was stored just as a single character token in memory - the program was stored tokenized and ready to be interpreted. It was fundamentally impossible to type certain classes of syntax error.<p>I remember being kind of surprised when I came across the BBC Micro and C64 where you had to <i>type</i> BASIC keywords out in full. It felt crazy - how could the computer handle you mistyping &#x27;prnit&#x27;? How come the computer let you type lines of BASIC in that were wrong?<p>I still think there&#x27;s something slightly broken about the fact that text editors let you type syntactically invalid code.",1430882941

I&#x27;m very bad at playing the piano, basketball, painting of creating huge corporations, some people are very good at those things and a free economy allows them to do so. Good for them.<p>As for inequalities being a problem, as long as the quality of life improves for all, I don&#x27;t see where&#x27;s the problem. The poorest in America live longer and are more educated than the richest men in the world less than a century ago. Not bad.<p>> Also to claim that governments that produces such things as the law, education systems, and national defence have no valuable products is a bit odd.<p>If it&#x27;s so valuable then why force people to pay for it?

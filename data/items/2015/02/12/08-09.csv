At my school the professors kept telling us how wonderful it is to have a math degree and that you&#x27;ll do this and that no problem. They push you to go to graduate school because you show promise. Only to be paid very little and have a difficult future. Of course you don&#x27;t do your due diligence at first because you trust your profs. And by the time you get to graduate school there is a sort of momentum that keeps you in.",1423731527

I feel that better type systems do help one model the world better (while retaining the consistency checking that you mentioned).

They had a lot of unique original ideas, but both would have been much better received were it not for all the hype that set such unrealistic expectations.<p>The idea behind Total Distortion was that you went out into a virtual world, explored, fought guitar battles, took pictures, and shot video. Behind the scenes, the pictures and videos were annotated with metadata about the subjects.<p>Then you went back to your multimedia production studio and used a miniature kid-friendly version of Adobe Premier to produce music videos using the raw content you gathered from the game. Implementing a music video editor in Director was an amazing technical achievement in and of itself.<p>But then (and here&#x27;s the hard part) you had to sell you music videos to simulated hollywood agents, who evaluated your videos based on their (very diverse and whacky) personal preferences. The metadata in the pictures and video you used would entertain or disgust the various agents in different ways, and they&#x27;d give you feedback along the lines of &quot;I&#x27;m a people person, and I want to see more people in it!&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;ll be honest fellas, it was sounding great, but I could have used a little more cowbell.&quot;<p>But Joe Sparks demoed it at so many conferences that it was a running joke that it would never be released, because he keep adding new cool features to make each demo more awesome than the last. When it finally was released, it was a big disappointment, after seeing all those fantastic demos.<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20090516110053/http://www.gamespot.com/features/vaporware/html/number3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20090516110053/http://www.gamespo...</a><p>It was a brilliant idea that was way before its time, and pushed the limits of the technology, incorporating machinima and video editing into a game, but the execution was mediocre compared to all the great hype. It was terribly difficult to implement that kind of stuff in Director in the early 90&#x27;s. It would be great to see somebody try the same idea again, but with modern technology.",1423730236

Random generators are quite a dangerous area.<p>Picking one is not without compromises:\nDo you want your PRNG fast? Or do you want it cryptographically secure?<p>It could become obsolete in less time than expected.\nIt&#x27;s mostly true for CSPRNGs. Maybe that&#x27;s why they are considering Mersenne Twister which is &quot;good enough&quot; for many use cases but not meant to be cryptographically secure. Sure, I&#x27;m using it right now for physics simulation and it&#x27;s certainly good enough for that and it&#x27;s hard to imagine a case where a 623-dimansionally equidistributed PRNG could fail. But it most certainly can if it can&#x27;t be used for cryptography. It is <i>much</i> better than rand() though and one could argue that it will be good enough 99% of the time. The problem that you can&#x27;t replace it if it ever becomes obsolete since some software depends on the predictability and still random like features of PRNGs (like game map generators, digital art, etc...).<p>I think the one boost library they should standardize is boost&#x27;s random device. PRNGs could become obsolete but &quot;truly random&quot; will always mean the same.

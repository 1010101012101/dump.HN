They do the homoiconic, macro thing without any supposedly frightening s-expressions.<p>Because, as I read this post, I&#x27;m thinking, well hell, <i>all</i> of these features [1] are syntactic sugar that already exist in e.g. Racket, and if they didn&#x27;t, could be added by anyone.

Regardless of how many layers of bureaucracy they hide behind, they are bad people.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s only &quot;bad&quot; when you look at it from the outside. You can point to this person or that person and say, &quot;You&#x27;re bad,&quot; or &quot;You&#x27;re evil,&quot; and smugly congratulate yourself that you would never act in such a fashion. You don&#x27;t know what pressures or incentives they were subject to. You don&#x27;t know what other choices they had. Moreover, your approach puts the blame on the line workers - the worker dumping the oil into the storm drain, the truck driver driving 20 hours a day, the manager writing up a justification of why an unreasonable risk is reasonable after all - while assigning no culpability to the leadership of the organization that created the circumstances where those actions were the most reasonable alternative. You expect people to stand up and throw themselves into the gears of the machine even if the inevitable consequence is that they get crushed, and the machine rolls on, heedless.<p>I used to think in much the same fashion. But then I read a very powerful book: Diane Vaughan&#x27;s <i>Challenger Launch Decision</i>. I would challenge you to read that book and identify, of all the people involved in the decision to launch the Challenger on that fateful day, which one acted in an <i>evil</i> manner? Which engineer wasn&#x27;t at least trying to act in the best interest of the organization and the crew?<p>That&#x27;s the point I&#x27;m trying to make. People can be trying to good, but, because of the information available to them, the incentives they operate under, and the time or social pressure they&#x27;re subject to, their actions can work towards bad outcomes. Tarring those people as &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; does nothing to change the organization that those people operate under, and simply ensures that the next person in the same position in the organization just makes the same mistakes.",1386381328

These gag orders prevent the insurer from making the hospital&#x27;s rates public, and what&#x27;s more, the terms of these contracts usually forbid insurers from even revealing the existence of these gag orders. Believe me, insurers would <i>love</i> to be able to steer policyholders towards cheaper and higher quality -- better <i>value</i> -- care, but these gag orders make it almost impossible for them to do so.

For example, I&#x27;m annoyed that many US politicians will dote over how awesome Mandela was in expressing their sympathies over his passing, but there is no talk of how we sided against him.<p>[1] For example, Mother Theresa explicitly withheld pain-killers from the people that she treated because she felt that the pain brought them closer to God.

As an expat now living in Japan, one of the awesome things about being here was that although it&#x27;s a wildly different environment and culture, the rule of law, freedom of speech, and fundamental democracy have been unquestioned. If you violate the law, and are caught, there are consequences -- like it was the USA of my youth.<p>This isn&#x27;t just a &#x27;secrecy&#x27; law; as (vaguely) written, it is also a <i>censorship</i> law that goes even further than the US &#x27;PATRIOT&#x27; act. You can theoretically be imprisoned for a tweet, or a peaceful gathering, or basically if the government just waves its hands and mumbles &#x27;terrorism&#x27;.<p>This kind of law was one of the main lubricants for the United States&#x27;s ignominious slide into unlawful, unconstitutional depravity: kidnapping, imprisonment without charge, assassination, murder, torture. Once something can not be found out -- or cannot be published or discussed even if it is found out -- the government and various bad actors within it have a shield that lets them ignore the law or the constitution and do what the fuck they want.<p>I don&#x27;t envision Japan going as bad as America any time soon -- it has, after all been the most peaceful major nation of the last 65 years, having not exercised military aggression toward any nation in that time.[1]<p>But still, the degradation of a democratic society is something to be lamented. And America&#x27;s role in overturning its own best legacy is shameful.<p>[1]: But: one (unsubstantiated) theory I have heard floated is that this was rammed through as a presage to a secret Japanese nuclear weapons program. With China becoming an increasingly aggressive and hostile bad actor in Asia,  using its military to make wild bombastic threats against Japan (and Vietnam, and the Philippines), unilaterally trying to assert ownership over more and more territory in the region, Japan has found itself in a situation that looks more and more like the USSR-era Cold War -- but with no hope other than to rely on the US for protection.",1386380677

I think that narrative is a very effective way to get a point across, and it also may be how we (as cognitive beings) are fundamentally wired. Did you ever stop to think that your life which appears to have a coherent narrative thread only appears so because you internally and involuntarily constantly construct and reconstruct this narrative thread overlaid on the messy indigestible complex fragments of your existence. Like the persistence of vision allows the discrete frames blend into continuity.<p>The pattern is us.",1386379368

To begin with, the IRA&#x27;s objective was not civil rights for Northern Ireland&#x27;s Catholic/Nationalist minority. The Provisional Sinn Féin/Provisional IRA hydra always made it absolutely clear that their goal was the establishment of &quot;a thirty-two county socialist republic&quot;. That means that they were seeking to impose, by force, a single all-Ireland state on the Protestant/Unionist majority of Northern Ireland against its wishes. This is a straightforward small-n nationalist objective, not a democratic or (&quot;clasically&quot;) liberal or humanitarian one. Secondly, and secondarily, even at their worst the civil disabilities imposed on Northern Ireland&#x27;s Catholic/Nationalist minority (though real and serious) were not really comparable with what South Africa&#x27;s black majority was made to suffer. And when those disabilities were corrected (and when the UK government began massively and even-handedly subsidising the whole Northern Ireland economy, to keep both Catholics and Protestants in jobs and forestall a collapse of the NI economy brought on by the IRA&#x27;s campaign) it made not a blind bit of difference to the IRA, because, once again, Northern Ireland Catholics/Nationalists enjoying political and personal freedom within the UK was contrary to their objective. Finally, when the population of Northern Ireland participated in largely free and fair elections to the UK parliament, not only most Northern Ireland voters overall, but <i>most voters from the Catholic/Nationalist community in Northern Ireland</i> consistently rejected the IRA&#x27;s campaign by voting for politicians who opposed it and rejecting the IRA&#x27;s candidates (running under its Sinn Féin political wing). They had no mandate from anyone.<p>The &quot;peace process&quot; basically consisted of SF/IRA giving up and accepting the political arrangement which they had been violently opposing for decades, in exchange for goodies for themselves. As such it&#x27;s a bit much to laud Adams for his role in it, beyond noting his success in persuading his fellow desperadoes to accept the goodies instead of continuing their deeply beloved war. (Though it turns out his success at this was pretty partial too.) Nonetheless if you don&#x27;t think Adams has been glorified you&#x27;re quite mistaken. As soon as the &quot;peace process&quot; began Adams (and Martin McGuinness, the Tweedledum to his Tweedledee) were the beneficiaries of an almost full-spectrum political and media bulldozing campaign in the Republic of Ireland, the UK and worldwide in support of the peace process and its heroes and against any hard questions.

Of course the integration has a cost. I believe that it simply costs a whole lot more of if everyone does that integration themselves. I can pay Clever a monthly fee or I can pay several developers to go out and learn how to do it at $100k a pop. Even if Clever is charging me $10k/month I&#x27;m still coming out pretty far ahead.<p>Not to mention the cost of ongoing maintenance every time something changes at an individual school.<p>tldr; you can spread the cost of integrating one time out among a bunch of companies, or each company can do it themselves. One of those is (by far) not only more efficient, but very likely much cheaper as well.",1386378179

From what I can gather, the numbers on the website, are cost numbers, i.e. what the hospital tells CMS it costs them (which is a number they are free to make whatever).<p>If you want to know why costs vary so much, starting looking at reimbursement.  Hospitals are incentivized to raise their list prices because many of them are paid a set percentage.",1386378170

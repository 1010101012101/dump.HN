Gamma was more or less constant up until the housing bubble.<p>I'm guessing the ""true value"" of a house was in the neighborhood of gamma x (price to rent).",1234234775

The reason I say this, and some will disagree, is based on where your attention stream is.<p>In your inbox, that's where your attention stream exists. When something new pops in, you check. The reason email spam works is because it inserts itself into your stream. Whether you actually go and click through on whatever's it is your own damn fault though.<p>The reason that ""spam"" in the context of email can't exist on Twitter is precisely because you have an on/off switch for who's allowed to post into your attention stream. I used to follow Robert Scoble because he's interesting. But yammers on constantly about the most inane crap that it completely floods out the interesting stuff.

474584,comment,473438,473633,0,0,dkarl,,,"I worked at a company where we very seriously talked about adopting Ada.  Let me tell you what else takes the fun out of programming besides an overly strict language:  knowing that if the customer encounters a bug, he will send you an email, stop using your software, and use a competing solution until you ship him a new release.<p>At that job I shipped the least-buggy, most-correct code I have ever shipped in my life, yet I also had the highest sense of incompetence and failure I've ever had.  The stress level when making code changes was incredibly high, especially since the code was mostly legacy (i.e., lacking documentation and tests) and introducing even rudimentary testing required rewriting large parts of the system -- which of course created bugs and made regression tests rather less useful than they should have been.<p>I even had a dream once about reading the gcc manual and finding a new warning flag, -Wsomethingorother.  I was really excited.  Then I was really disappointed when I woke up.<p>I REALLY wish that codebase had been writting in Ada.  The code was mostly correct (though hideously designed) when I inherited it; if it was written in Ada, the runtime checks would have caught a lot of cases when an innocuous-looking bugfix in one part of the code caused another part of the code to start dereferencing stale data and mixing a subtle spurious signal into the customer's results.  In the worst case, we would have had an immediate failure with a good head-start on debugging.  Ada might have actually preserved some of the fun of programming for me.<p>Nothing else I've worked on has called for Ada, though.  It's a niche language and should definitely be considered whenever writing a mostly-static system where you're willing to invest a lot of time per loc to avoid bugs.",1234233728

474581,comment,474110,474547,0,0,fallentimes,,,"Agreed. The case is much more clear cut for sports than it is for concerts. What you're talking about exists in the form of presale passwords:<p><a href=""http://ticketstumbler.com/blog/presale-passwords-faqs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ticketstumbler.com/blog/presale-passwords-faqs/</a><p>Presale passwords allow fans to gain access to tickets before the public sale. However, scalpers can pretty easily acquire them and the sales limits aren't very hard to game. What does tend to happen though is that the investment banker type (is that reference even valid anymore? :-D) can buy his tickets on the secondary market at the last minute from TicketsNow, which Ticketmaster owns, and sometimes the artist receives a cut of those proceeds. To people on Hacker News, market prices makes a lot of sense, but in practice they scare a lot of people away. Fixed prices are why Ebay acquired Half.com & Stubhub. And it's why places that deal with futures or more complex purchasing options like First Dibz have blown through loads of cash without gaining much traction; the people behind those sites aren't the target market.<p>What's also interesting is that artists tend to make more money from tours than CDs, merchandise, itunes, etc (as the label gets a significantly larger cut of the latter). So maybe there's some behind the scenes pressure to ensure sellouts and drive the type of sales that benefit the label most.<p>One final thought: if an artist becomes really hot (like the Flight of the Conchords currently) shows can be added...double or tripling supply in a given metropolitan area. The same thing cannot be done with sports.",1234233505

474576,comment,474460,474460,0,0,patio11,,,"There is a Japanese toilet company, whose name escapes me, which previously included a red dot in toilets to capture this advantage.  Then, after extensive testing, they realized that the red dot was suboptimal because it encouraged people to shoot for the wall, and the wall of a toilet bowl is very close to things you do not want to get wet.<p>So they tested a new version, which turned out to be MUCH better: include a laser in the toilet bowl, and PROJECT a red dot on the surface of the water at a particular point in the bowl.  (I would assume the geometric center but, hey, they're the experts).<p>My Google-fu is not turning up the article I read this in, which (I hazily remember) was English and probably in the New York Times.<p>Anyhow, this is one of my stock anecdotes on why Japanese engineering holds so much appeal to me.

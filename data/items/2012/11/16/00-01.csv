4791794,comment,4791295,4791663,3,0,ghshephard,,,"I think the key is to understand what should be considered part of our ""critical infrastructure"" and ensure that is reliable.<p>For example, when I was managing the IT organization for our company, despite the fact that everyone in the office has a cell phone, and despite the fact that they also have a VOIP phone (Polycom Soundpoint IP 501 SIP), that is driven of of POE connections, and we have a generator with 36 hours of diesel supplying the routers/switches that supply those phone - Every conference room had a POTS (Plain Old Telephone Systems) analog phone line that was cross-connected with a piece of copper at our punch-down block, directly to the 300 pair coming into our MPOE - no active electronics (on site) required.  Those <i>land</i> lines are the critical infrastructure, that need to be defended (along with COs backing them up).<p>If someone comes up with a good (cheap) attack against them, that will get my attention.<p>I guess another way of approaching this is, if Police/Fire/Medical organization start relying on LTE systems, and those LTE systems become a critical part of our infrastructure for economic/infrastructure/life safety systems, then yes, we need to start focussing on hardening them.<p>This is my way of saying yes, when we wargame this out, we should consider ""What happens if there is an extended LTE outage during a disaster, does this impact our first responders significantly?  And if so, we need to take steps to protect ourselves there.""<p>Important to note - it's highly unlikely that any group of people will be able to establish a coordinated attack on 20 major metros.  That level of conspiracy would be stopped by the time planning got to the 3-5 city attack.<p>And that's another  point - let's not spend large sums of money trying to harden  the LTE system (though, reasonable investment makes sense, so the research presented is good) - but instead, let's direct those resources to tracking (and stopping) the bad guys that would do this sort of thing in the first place.  That, then, protects us from <i>all</i> of their attacks, not just the LTE wireless system.",1353027556
4791793,comment,4788536,4791690,2,0,asayers,,,"It's not stupid - the difference between uncertainty and superposition is subtle. Let's simplify to the case of one pen.<p>Say the pen is spun in the box by a classical random number generator. You don't know which way the pen is spinning, but you do know that it's either been spun one way or the other. You might say that the probability of finding it spinning clockwise when you open the box is 1/2.<p>Now say the pen is prepared in a superposition of the two spin states, again in the box. As before, we might say that the probability of discovering the pen spinning clockwise is 1/2. However, this time we the probability isn't generated by our lack of knowledge: we know exactly what state then pen is in. When we open the box, however, the pen will change instantly to the state of spinning clockwise, or the state of spinning anti-clockwise.<p>In the quantum case, the probability is an expression of what we think <i>will</i> happen to the pen, not what we think <i>has</i> happened to it.<p>It is hard to grasp, and harder still to believe. There is, however, good reason for thinking that, sometimes, the pen changed just as we opened the box.",1353027532

4791776,comment,4791295,4791750,14,0,jacquesm,,,"In radio transmission there is no substitute for power, both on the jamming side as well as on the side that wants to get their message through.<p>20 dB is a big deal because it would make the jammer a lot harder to locate, especially if it times its interruption well and can get away with extremely short bursts of activity followed by relatively long periods of silence.<p>Other tricks of the trade: jam from multiple locations with short bursts, slap the jammer right under the nose of the receiver that you want to jam (that way you need a minimal signal and are almost impossible to detect at range until you're right up to it).<p>This is the way TV pirates in Amsterdam would broadcast their signals in the 80's to the receiving dishes on Hotel Okura. They were so low power and right up close to the dishes that they could push legitimate broadcasts (mostly German TV) right out of their slot. KTA (the then monopolist on Cable TV in Amsterdam) had the un-enviable task to come up with a solution and finally settled on a system where if one antenna was flooded with a rogue signal they would switch to antennae mounted on a chimney of the electricity plant on the other side of the city (Amsterdam had very little high buildings).<p>Of course, pirate TV stations found out about this quickly enough and located another transmitter near there and so on.<p>I have all this info from hearsay, <i>cough</i>.",1353027244

4791774,comment,4789448,4791378,1,0,allmakebelieve,,,"Hey Nicholas, thanks so much for writing this up again! Really kind of you.<p>Good point about the FB stuff - we did have the option to browse, but that seems to have been missed in the latest update.<p>The SEO suggestion is spot on. It's something we've perhaps lost sight of a little in the throws of building the site, but in hindsight, it's something we should have been building in right from the beginning. Discrete geographic sections, as you suggest, could be great for this.<p>The social 'flow' too is something that's important which isn't fully developed yet. I agree with every post you should have the option to auto-tweet / post, in fact the app should lead you through this process & make it feel rewarding too.<p>The sharing buttons we have in there right now are (as I think you said in your original post) admittedly a bit half-baked - so also a great place to improve :)<p>In terms of community, it's a slow burn. We've been reaching out to a few local communities for whom Yoink really makes 'sense' - i.e. Burning Man, Freegans and Disaffected Freecyclers but as much as they've provided incredibly positive feedback, there's still a lot of friction to getting things listed. It's amazing how easy it is for someone to say they like something, but then the next step - taking an action - is immensely harder. Whilst some could see this as discouraging, we rather are trying to find out what the real 'mechanic' is for people who'd want to post. Ultimately I guess whatever we do it largely comes down to a lot of grunt work, which slowly builds inventory & traction.<p>I'll have more of a think about online communities, and potential ad partners.<p>Flyering has afforded limited success so far, Of ~500 flyers handed out to people, we calculated around 60 visits, 10 signups, 1 post.. So it doesn't seem to be the most efficient system just yet :) I wonder how effective it actually is.. if you think to yourself how many times have you ever taken a flyer and taken action...?<p>But a few interesting things to think about for sure!

Outside of Moore's law graphs (which he didn't discover), his predictions quickly veer off course into crazy land, especially in the case of diets and theories on intelligence (which others have routinely criticized him for - see everywhere).<p>But here's the problem I have with Ray Kurzweil and other people like him - you can't just ignore them, you can't just write them off. He's like the Joker. A guy that makes proclamations on the edge of what's reasonable, and when he's right, he's really right - and the results of what he thinks are about to happen will really screw us all. I think this of all slightly off kilter people, Peter Thiel, Aubrey de Grey, Sean Parker, Elon Musk (the least off kilter of the bunch - most rational - but man, does this guy take insane risks - I'm long TSLA :), Ray Kurzweil, Peter Diamandis (he is amongst one of the worst on the proclamations) - these are people who should be listened to, not because anything that they actually say makes any sense - because they often don't.<p>No, they should be listened to because of the very nature of their personalities. The way their personalities are set up makes them act like early black swan detection devices. This allows them to call the black swans out well before they're apparent to the rest of us. More often than not, they're wrong though.<p>They're like the canaries in the coal mine. Vigilant, plenty of false alarms, and usually ignored most of the time.<p>But sometimes these people, they are just so fucking right - that you better hope you are on the right side of the wave they just called out.<p>Too many people have been screwed thinking that the crazy fool talking about crazy things should be ignored. The counterfactual is also true:<p><i>> All prophets are false prophets.</i><p>So watch these guys out of the corner of your eye, don't take them too seriously most of the time, but if things come up, again and again and again - take notice, think carefully and make your own decisions.<p>They are just early warning detection systems - it's up to you to make the final decision as to whether or not it's time to fire the nuke (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov</a>).",1353026431

[1] Although still in draft form, the section ""No Unjustified 3D"" is relevant:<p>> Many people have the intuition that if two dimensions are good, three dimensions must be better  after all, we live in a three-dimensional world. However, there are many difficulties in visually encoding information with the third spatial dimension, depth, which has important differences from the two planar dimensions.<p>> The cues that convey depth information to our visual system include occlusion, perspective distortion, shadows and lighting, familiar size, stereoscopic disparity, and others. This section discusses the costs of these depth cues in a visual encoding context, and also the challenges of text legibility given current display technology. It then discusses in what situations the benefits of showing depth information could outweigh these costs, and the need for justification that the situation has been correctly analyzed.<p>> In brief, 3D is easy to justify when the users task involves shape understanding of inherently three-dimensional structures. In this case, which frequently occurs with inherently spatial data, the benefits of 3D absolutely outweigh the costs, and designers can use the many interaction techniques designed mitigate those costs.<p>> In all other contexts, the use of 3D needs to be carefully justified. In most cases, rather than choosing a visual encoding using three dimensions of spatial position, a better answer is to visually encode using only two dimensions of spatial position. Often an appropriate 2D encoding follows from a different choice of data abstraction, where the original dataset is transformed by computing derived data.<p>Although I'm not sure I would recommend it, you can do 3D in D3.js by extending the DOM to represent a 3D scenegraph.

It's a $20 containers of gasoline.<p>If you want to hurt people, it's pretty much impossible to stop you from doing so (or even slowing you down) - all we can do is catch you, and put you in prison after you do so so that you can't hurt more people.<p>I'm not suggesting we ignore security (I like SSL, and passwords on my accounts) - but we can't create a world where everyone has to treat the populace as though they are intent on creating destruction.   This is the mindset of the TSA and ""Search everyone, because any one of them might be carrying a bomb.""  At a certain point, we have to trust that the vast, vast majority of people are good.<p>And, in the whole scope of things, jamming an LTE radio transmission system has pretty big penalties, and very little financial payoff, and a pretty good chance of being caught.  It's one of those asymmetric criminal activities that is balanced in favor of society, and against the criminal.<p>Where you want to put your attention in enhancing defenses, is places where there is a strong incentive to commit the crime, and less chance of being caught.  Guarding against petty thieves, lots of safeguards/fraud alerts around things like credit cards, or your paypal account.  That's where attention needs to be spent.<p>You know where it's important to spend a lot of money on counter-jamming?  Life Safety systems like Nuclear Power Plants, or Plane/Car navigation systems.  Where <i>lives</i> are on the line, I totally agree that we need to harden, harden, harden those systems.  Also, SCADA systems - that control large amounts of underlying infrastructure.  And the Stock Exchange.  Spend a fortune on ensuring that the bad guys can't cause havoc,  kill people, or create large economic damage.<p>Perhaps your LTE/Cellular coverage is better than mine, but I'm pretty used to having to track down a WiFi connection to get any serious work done, or make a reliable Skype call.  I  don't put LTE coverage in the ""Mission Critical"" category of infrastructure.<p>Also, if you are in a situation (Prison, battlefield) where the vast majority of your opponents are intent on doing you harm, you also harden the crap out of everything.  And pay the price - because you need to.<p>But, all else equal,  I'd rather have the money/resources that might have gone into putting MILSPEC anti-jamming capabilities into my LTE NIC, instead be spent on making it cost less, draw less battery, and give me more bandwidth.<p>Let the FCC catch the 3-5 jammers at year intent on doing harm, and put them in prison to consider the wisdom of their behavior.",1353024634

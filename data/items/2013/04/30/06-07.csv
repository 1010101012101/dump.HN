I posted the above submission a couple years ago. Today, my invention,  Open Platform as a Service(tm) is arguably one of the hottest things on the Web in the space. If you don't want to read the whole post/rant, here is the gist. I applied to Y in 2011 with Open Platform as a Service and got rejected. Fine. But Y provided no feedback on why even when asked. I thought that was ridiculous to not even give a single sentence as to why you are not accepted as how does that help programmers? So of course I did what a lot of programmers would do, I ranted about :) Not the rejection, the zero feedback rationale. So what is the lesson. At the end of the day, Y is great. Not because they miss or hit, Paul acknowledges they miss things. Y is great because they know they miss and they communicate that should not stop you. They even let the developer post critical comments on same. So did I come back to say I was right and Y was wrong? No. We were both right. The take away is never die the first time.

It works kind of OK for small histories, but if you do something slightly complex or your history is not meticulous, rebasing becomes extremly tedious. The worse example is a conflict in a reverted commit. A merge will flatten the diff and skip the reverted commit entirely, while a rebase will require you to fix the conflict twice. And while a merge is tedious to revert, it is possible. Good luck saving a branch ravaged by a bad rebase.",1367304624

Think of the use of a Chinese satellite like the US using a Chinese made laptop or mobile phone, not really a big deal. We're talking about the US government here, the data would be heavily encrypted but if things were to ever sour the Chinese wouldn't need to try and decrypt the traffic to cause problems, they'd merely have to disable access to the satellite and boom! US loses a massive amount of needed bandwidth which would be far more damaging than decrypting the information I'd assume.<p>Considering just how much money is spent on defence yearly in the US I am surprised something as trivial as satellite bandwidth capacity is an issue. More money is spent on the military than anything else in the budget and yet after all of those hundreds of billions, still need to borrow capacity from a Chinese satellite. Makes you wonder where the priorities actually are doesn't it?<p>This is not really a big deal as far as privacy is concerned, it does however show just how reliant the US amongst other countries have become on countries like China for innovating and help keeping up with this heavily connected and forever-evolving world. Hopefully the in-sourcing boom trend continues and perhaps the US starts innovating and relying on itself again instead of others.",1367304516

This is literally the only reason I migrated to Opera not too long ago.<p>I have 16gb of ram on my pc, and regularly have >100 tabs open at any given time; I may be in a weird minority of some sort, but decent x64 support really makes my life a <i>lot</i> easier.  I still load up Chrome and Firefox when I know I'm only going to be using them for a short/quick session, but as much as I like them, they just become awfully painful to use beyond that use case for me. Unfortunately, it seems Opera is following suit with the other vendors and is probably abandoning its x64 version, but at least they were the one vendor that pursued it enough to release something usable. Waterfox and the 'official' x64 builds of Firefox crash way too much for me to even consider. I understand the hell of trying to port to a 64-bit architecture when you're reliant on tons of old 32-bit libraries and such, but I really don't like this trend of staying overly complacent in the 32-bit realm when our hardware has been capable of more for a good while now...<p>When I'm on Linux however: Chromium all the way!",1367303394

I've seen studies that show that burnout is caused by sustained imbalance between your personal goals and how you're living your life. This can also happen retro actively. For example, if you were to find out that you weren't going to get paid for a job you'd been working the last 6 months on, you would almost instantly be burned out. That is, if you were doing it for the money of course. Your personal goal is to spend a certain percentage of your time on things that will increase your wealth, and if you weren't to get paid, the sudden overwhelming sense of losing six months would burn you out immediately.<p>Likewise in a startup, I think the studies would say that you find yourself burned out because at some point, something inside you says, ""80 hours a week for the last year wasn't really completely in line with all my personal goals. I have a goal to have personal relationships, spend time with my family, and exercise, yet this startup is the only thing I've been doing."" At some point a voice inside says, ""It wasn't worth it.""<p>People have very different goals, so results will vary as to what causes burnout, but as a boss, something I know will cause burnout is anything that will pull the rug out from under an employee regarding benefits that they expected to receive. For startups this is super tricky because some employees are expecting an IPO with big payouts, and when they get disillusioned about that, there's really no way to stop the burnout.",1367302606

If something goes wrong and it loses propulsion, power has to be available immediately to operate the systems that can handle the emergency - whether it's blowing ballast or restarting the reactor. This is a somewhat different constraint than the procedure described by the other reply - ships float without power, subs, not always.<p>I mentioned this upthread - USS Thresher[1] seems to have suffered a loss of both propulsion and ballast control while near test-depth with, unfortunately, tragic results for the vessel and all on board.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Thresher_(SSN-593)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Thresher_(SSN-593)</a>",1367302002

It's not 2011 anymore, there's lots of tooling that makes viewing changelogs on a branch compare easy (Github's pull requests being probably the most common).<p>Rebasing removes your changes from the _context_ they were originally made, which makes following along through the project's history harder than it needs to be. It also creates revisions of the codebase that never actually existed, which means it's difficult if not impossible to use git-bisect to track down when a really gnarly bug was introduced (I've actually needed to resort to that 3 or 4 times in the past few years, to help track down the cause of the bug).",1367301871

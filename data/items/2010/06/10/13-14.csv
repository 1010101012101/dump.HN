1420060,comment,1419163,1419286,0,0,pedoh,,,"One issue I would caution about VPSes is that because there can be more than one VPS on a physical server, there has to be contention for resources. The vast majority of the time this may not (and hopefully will not) be an issue, but imagine that one VPS starts hammering disk. The disk has a performance limit, and therefore the resource can be starved. The managing server will do its best to prevent one VPS from affecting another, but it can and does happen. If the physical server has a huge RAID array of disks this problem will be lessened greatly; likewise if it has 8 cores instead of one. If it's not standard practice for a hosting provider to tell customers what hardware your VPS is running on and how many other VPSes can be on the machine, it should be.",1276178333

You want to do this quickly, if you do a site for free the client will be more willing to go ahead straight away as it requires little decision making. We did a website for a primary school and a couple of photographers we knew to start off with.<p>- You're probably going to need to have low prices to start with, as smaller businesses are more willing to give a new business a shot, but won't have as much of a budget as bigger companies. Over time you can decide where you want to take the business and start charging more as you build a reputation. Your aim at this point is to build a portfolio, so you can charge more later on.<p>- Classified ads on Gumtree or whatever the equivalent is in your area. We met two of our biggest clients through classified ads (just be honest, link to your site and try and get across your ethos).<p>- Reach out to personal network, previous employers etc... they already trust you (hopefully) and may have work that can keep you going.<p>- Get involved with a co-working space, this has 3 main benefits: 1) regain some of the social element of work, which you may have lost if you previously worked in an office environment. 2) Meet other business owners and freelancers that can offer advice and are a good sounding board, and interesting people usually too. 3) You might even get work from other business working at the same space. We've got a couple of clients as a result of using a co-working space.<p>- Cold calls! I could write a whole post on this, but basically, try and figure out a niche and what your hook is; Why are you going to go after a particular niche? Have you worked in this industry before? Can you offer a service that will add value to them? Are you in their area (geographically)?<p>Remember this is one of the hardest bits of going it alone but once you gain some momentum and build a portfolio it will get easier.",1276178257

1420054,comment,1419896,1419952,0,0,napierzaza,,,"I think these companies thrive with a confusing market. If you can easily compare two products then the purchase is muddied. I've seen this often with different grocery store products in regards to volumes and masses on sale for fungible items.<p>I think it's best to have confusing figures and specs when you have all these manufacturers who are really trying to produce the cheapest of something (in this case PCs or cellphones). You put the money and the marketing in maybe one overworked detail (big screen, big HDD, fast video card) and then cheap out on everything else.

1420053,comment,1419605,1419903,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"From memory (sorry no source) I believe it is related to the amount of emotional tension the individual experiences, and the release felt, in making the purchase. It is not the amount of money involved. So taking two people with the same income and net worth, if one person gets very emotionally committed and spends a lot of time socializing and projecting how great product X is going to be and feeling bad because he doesn't have it yet, and the other person just buys it on a lark? The first person will tend to be very dogmatic, perhaps religious or irrational, about the value of the product. This effect is culmulative.<p>By the way, this ""release"" that is felt after the immediate purchase has a tremendous cognitive blinding ability. The purchaser is something like 100 times more willing to buy some related product in the immediate minutes after the big decision is made while the ""glow"" is still there. LOTS of folks make BIG money exploiting this.<p>By the way, the tendency among intelligent people is to view a lot of this as ""psycho-babble"" or some such. So they spend a lot of time online, doing research, reading various opinions, making an informed choice -- all the while falling into the trap outlined above. Except they don't see it.<p>Humans are really cool to observe. They are the only creatures that can act completely emotionally and then beat the heck out of you using logic and facts when you point out what's going on. That's neat",1276178221

These are valuable to a broad spectrum of businesses which have rather more money than I do.<p>When I wanted to do some consulting work, I contacted folks I knew from blogging (and other forms of participation on the Internet) and said ""Hey, are you interested in buying my time?  I know you need X, you know I can do X very well, how's about I X for you?""  (Both of them said ""X is kind of meh but if you could Y we'd be thrilled"", and happily I could Y, too.)<p>How much you charge starting out is entirely a market question.  I'll give you my typical pricing advice for anything: ""Charge more.""  You will have better clients, because cheapskates are disproportionately pathological clients, and your clients will be happier with your work.  Price communicates an expectation of value, and that framing is <i>shockingly</i> durable.  Incidentally, if they're hiring <i>you</i> rather than an undifferentiated freelancer in X, then the global market clearing price is <i>whatever you say it is</i>.<p>You can also get inbound offers in a similar fashion.  (If I were more interested in them, I'd have a page on my site advertising my availability and making a focused case for hiring me, and I'd optimize that page with all the tricks I use for product pages.  And detail exactly how I did it on the page, because that is, after all, a visible indication that I'm good at what I claim to be good at.)",1276177414

As you get more and more work coming in, raise your prices. Keep doing so until your work drops off, then drop your prices a bit, and keep doing so until you get work.

That's it.<p>> How can build a great foundation where I can understand the concepts intuitively?<p>You're lucky, because you're in college.  It's the best place to do it.<p>Know the material.  If you can't draw a picture in 1 minute that would get the idea across to your grandmother, you don't understand it.  Every time it says ""Clearly,"" you prove whatever comes next. You close the book and put it away, and come back the next day and do the same thing.<p>Do all the problems. especially the hard ones at the end.  You <i>never</i> look at your notes or your book when doing them.  That's the difference between getting an A on the exam, and being able to teach someone that topic five years later.  Your study time (at least of fundamentals, which is most of university) should consist ~70% sitting in front of a knotty problem, with no books in sight.  It's recommended to do mainly hard problems, and it's absolutely OK to take several days to do them.  If you don't make progress for more than 20 minutes, stop and come back a few hours later or the next day.  But make sure you come back!<p>Now, here's the key:  you do all this <i>before</i> the lecture on that topic.  When you show up to lecture, you already know it cold.  Except that you'll have so many questions.  Most of your questions will start with ""Why.""  They will be the questions that the other kids will find annoying.  If you want to be smart, you need to be <i>that</i> guy.<p>Teach.  It's trite but true.  Teach people who seem smarter than you but don't know about this topic yet.  They'll help you understand what you don't know properly.  Also, our retention of information processed in a live setting is roughly 9x that from just reading.<p>Be curious.  Our brains are wired for stories rather than abstractions, and even technical fields have a narrative.  Who came up with this algorithm? How or why did it follow logically from what came before?  What came next?  By learning these things (the best way is to chat about it during office hours with professors, or with other smart students), you'll also be getting an informal education in what smartness and creativity look like in the real world.<p>Focus.  Do <i>not</i> do what's above for every class, or every topic.  Do it for only one topic at a time, that you're really interested in, exclusively.<p>Form a team.  This is probably the most difficult (at least for shy people like me), but the most rewarding.  If you know some other people who are also serious, and can get together and work with them in the fashion above, you will all progress much, much faster.  Try to have some and discipline: you meet twice a week for two hours and work like crazy, and then go to the pub afterward and wind down (just like a sports team).  If you can find a grad student or prof who's interested in ""coaching"" you, that will help even more.  This is what grad school has that college doesn't.  Create grad school for yourself in college, and you'll get smart much faster.<p>Play.  Creativity emerges most spontaneously during play.  Play means pet projects, hackathons, competitions, etc.  Research projects during the summer are perfect (choose them based on coolness and/or fun).  And play in completely unrelated areas, too (music is fantastic).  Non-academic recreation (e.g. lots of sex) is quite important.<p>> .. go to graduate school at Stanford or MIT<p>Question: <i>why</i> do you want to go to grad school at Stanford or MIT?<p>> I would just like to prove to myself that I have what it takes<p>That is probably not a good enough reason.  It's easy to become enamored with the <i>idea</i> of a thing. Spending all day wrestling with deep problems, letting your mind course over the beautiful edifice of ideas erected by those who came before. Unless you actually enjoy <i>doing</i> spending most of your day and most of your nights alone working, usually in a library or cramped office - then, perhaps there are other forms of ""smartness"" worth pursuing.<p>It's a decision only you can make - but if it's just about pride, I'll save you a lot of trouble and tell you it's not worth it.<p>> I've been feeling pretty lost in what I've wanted to do with my life<p>Most people feel the same way.  It will not stop you from living a worthwhile life.  The majority of interesting events and true life experiences you have will be unplanned - so don't take ""want to do with your life"" too seriously.<p>Have you ever seen the movie ""Yes man"" (Jim Carrey)?  Whatever happens, he just says yes.  As far as I can tell (at the tender age of 24) this is a good strategy for a successful, rewarding life.  It may sound at odds with the ""Focus"" paragraph above, but it's not.  You focus to improve yourself - and you say ""yes"" when serendipity comes knocking, often disguised as drudgery.<p>Good luck :)",1276176013

I personally find it easier to identify blub programmers than blub languages ...<p> As long as it resolves symbols (variable and function names) at run-time instead of compile-time, it can't be efficient. <p>That includes all dynamic languages i.e. Lisp, Ruby, Python, Perl, Smalltalk, JavaScript, Eiffel, Erlang, Forth, Lua et al.<p> No programming language is straight-forward unless you know all internals.<p>True, but as you say, that applies to any language. PHP is a very easy language for novices to pick up.<p> OOP ... gives nothing but an illusion of maintainability, while in reality you end up<p>In my experience OO code tends to be easier to maintain, and so long as you don't over do it, efficient.<p> Only good thing about PHP is that it's a dynamic language with dynamic strings and lists/arrays, it is embedded (in HTML) and is largely supported. And that's all you need for server programming on the Web.<p>That's why I recommended it as a good choice for web programming.",1178995520

I consider myself fairly skilled at making logos, and that's not due to taking classes or having an extremely artistic mind, it's due to spending several hours trying out different options and trying to emulate other logos.<p>I'm not sure if you've tried, but give it a shot. It's quite easy to pick up, and also extremely satisfying when you settle on a design you like.<p>I'm just not an advocate of having to pay someone else for something you can easily learn how to do and especially with a logo, you'll feel more of a connection to it.",1178995161

On the website, I solicited passionate hackers, telling them, that together - we'd ""change the world"" (hey, sometimes you need the grandiose visions).<p>It cost me $50, and I go around 15 talented guys that wanted to spend the summer with me working on a startup.  The hardest part was picking two.",1178993371

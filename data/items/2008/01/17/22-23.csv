100035,comment,100035,99691,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Huh? First you said that uncompressed movies take up about 25gb for 2 hours. Blu-ray movies are generally around 25gb, which leaves the second layer free for extras or whatever.<p>Then you said that ""blue-ray is not uncompressed video (thus, 25GB holds a 2 hour compressed movie)"" By your own math they would only take up 12.5ish gb if compressed.<p>I actually am curious what digital cable uses. It's definitely 720p in my area, and probably compressed, but not highly.",1200610649

Well played.<p>But, this still applies to some more of the posts here. I notice that, for the most part, people are harking against news.yc being flooded with crappy submissions and turning into digg/reddit. Then you have threads like this where a portion of the focus of these comments are geared towards giving tips on how to have high karma retrieving posts.<p>In my opinion, karma is nice and all, but the main purpose of news.yc is to submit quality articles, articles that interest you and may interest others, without karma valuation playing a role in submitting something. That is part of the reason why digg has devolved into what it is now. People began to put a great deal of emphasis and importance on accumulating diggs, or karma here, which in turn decreased value of posts, and so on, blah blah.<p>In any case, vote me up!",1200609264

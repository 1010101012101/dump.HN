1522547,comment,1521190,1521335,0,0,noname123,,,"Your comment made me think in a different direction.<p>I had originally gotten in programming, as you said because of the excitement of hacking, ""hello world""; it was an intrinsic joy that I had that I derived although extrinsic rewards (striking it rich) was in the back of my head. But it wasn't the extrinsic demands that was driving me day-to-day, otherwise I would have gone into accounting instead of programming.<p>But it was all of these extrinsic demands that pushed me to climb the corporate ladder, deal with maintenance & management etc. In so doing, I was telling myself that I had to plough through these minutiae to get to my big external validation of climbing the ladder, becoming rich, etc - when in fact, it was my intrinsic motivation that got me to where I was from the get-go. And if getting to the and staying at the top means sacrificing the internal joy for external validations, then it's not worth it.<p>I used to think that dropping your obligations to the ladder is counterproductive to your career. But not anymore when I spend more rationalizing and calming myself down from all of the angst of writing TPS reports and posturing/covering my ass during meetings. I don't even have anymore energy/time to actually write code. And that's pretty damn counter-productive.<p>I always have taken a broad definition of hacking and I see this pattern everywhere. You could see playing guitar as having fun creating music & expressing yourself, or memorizing sets & rehearse & network to get your band signed to a huge label. You could see making friends and picking up women as having fun meeting people & expressing yourself, or memorizing sets & rehearse & network to up your social worth, etc.",1279313981

1522542,comment,1522218,1522490,0,0,idoh,,,"I agree that unions can be blamed for a lot of the issues. I'd add that a lot of the issues are caused by conflicts between the administration and the teachers. If you remove the unions then you'd have to reform the administration as well.<p>What I mean is that in a normal environment you'd start off as a teacher, and if you were capable you'd get more management responsibility, and could conceivably smoothly transition from junior teacher to senior teacher to department head to assistant principal to principal.<p>The way it works now is that they are two tracks - basically the workers (the teachers) and the management (the administrators), and the two don't mix. Teachers will organize staff parties, and it is controversial if administrators dare show up. In the past administrators would also teach a class or two - that practice is really frowned upon now.<p>So the above is a long-winded way of saying that there is a bizarre structure between the union and the administrators, and the whole thing would need to be untangled, not just the union side of things.",1279313950

The bicyclists take 22 days to do the same thing.<p>So, there are really only a couple of problems:<p>• if you're Zed Shaw, you apparently want to cut two wheels off an 18-wheeler, and if you're Zed Shaw, you're likely to screw up and choose the drive wheels for your demented sacrifice. You do that, the sucker won't even <i>roll</i>.<p>• the stupid hatas who judge the race won't acknowledge your achievement. Something about the allowed types of bicycle.

1522522,comment,1522396,1522493,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, I think like many Wikipedia policies it's a useful pragmatic policy. How it's applied to specific cases is always worth looking at, but in principle, a ton of articles with no real interest or citeable sources lead to low-quality stuff. If a Coca-Cola PR person were to insert a bunch of advertising fluff in their article, people would notice almost immediately and fix it. But if your corner barber shop writes an article about themselves with a bunch of advertising fluff, without a notability policy it might stay there for a long time, because nobody cares enough or has any information they can use to improve the article. I mean what would it even mean to have a good article about your corner barber shop? Would you base it on personal observation, or do independent interviews with the owner or something? Unless it's gotten <i>some</i> degree of attention for something, and gotten written up somewhere, it seems like a good idea to just decide there's not enough there to write a Wikipedia article on it.<p>(There really are a bunch of really small businesses trying to insert ad blurbs into Wikipedia, so it's not a purely hypothetical problem.

Math & Science teachers have a higher opportunity cost but they get the same wage as a PE teacher. I've talked with people in the union and other people, and basically they don't believe that free market principles should dictate how much people get paid.<p>- new teacher burnout: new teachers get the worst classes to teach, while the most experienced ones get to pick out their favorite ones. In addition, new teachers will have to teach many different classes compared to more senior ones, so this adds a lot to the load. In addition, at least at my wife's school, she was laid off every year for 5 years based on the seniority system. She got very high teacher evaluations but that doesn't matter in the seniority system.<p>- layoffs hit the young, cheaper and more energetic teachers, while keeping the expensive older teachers.<p>- it is nearly impossible to fire bad teachers. Some of the teachers slept in class, took field trips to the mall, or spent half a semester teaching handwriting. Everyone knows who the bad teachers are, but it is a bureaucratic nightmare to do anything about it.<p>- it is really hard to switch to different schools or districts. If you have a personality conflict you are sort of stuck with each other. Compare this to private industry - I've seen many people who were bad fits at one company do really well once they moved on.<p>... and I could go on.

Anyone used a card scanning devie/app would know that the accuracy is atrocious. That's a problem because a wrong contact is worse than no contact. We don't send anything back unless it's 100% accurate, even if we have to employ multiple people to double, triple check the answer.<p>Another angle is the simplicity. We made it so that everything is as simple as possible. You don't need to take a picture, just point your phone at a card, CardMunch automatically recognizes your card and uploads / transcribes / imports the contact right into the phone, all that with 0-click. We also do real-time syncing so that every update gets backed up on the server, so you never have to worry about losing a contact. All that that is done with 0 clicks, just let CardMunch handle it all.<p>If you were to propose a story to market this product, which in your opinion is a more compelling hook for a story, and why?<p>Thanks again for your feedback!",1279311153

The problem from a business standpoint is that it's hard to compete against free.<p>It's also pretty hard right now to crack the market without a lot of capital, because there isn't standardized electronic bill presentment that works in a high enough percentage of cases.  Therefore, you have to web-scrape.  Paytrust bootstrapped this by having billers mail paper bills to them, which they would scan and manually enter the amount due.  Since virtually everyone receives bills online now, the paper API isn't really viable.<p>If someone came up with a common format for bills which included some metadata like amount due, due date, name of biller, plus HTML or PDF for the actual bill, it would be very useful.  Then there is the question of delivery.  Most banks don't want to deliver the full bill by email -- they want you to log into their site.  If there were a standardized API with the ability to authorize third parties, it would make things much easier.<p>The only real opportunity I see is for Intuit to bring Paytrust into Mint.  There could be a lot of integration between the two, and the attention to detail that Mint has could make a world of difference to Paytrust.  Right now (insanely) you can't even export your paytrust transactions to Quicken, because a number of years ago, Quicken stopped supporting the QIF format, and this is the only format that Paytrust exports.",1279311084

What was your experience?<p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_count...</a><p>I recognize that statistics do not always capture the reality of a situation. However, in this case, I don't think it's adequate to simply deny their validity without any evidence. (The evidence you have adduced so far, from your personal experience, supports their validity rather than undermining it.)",1279310990

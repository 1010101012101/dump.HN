I'm sick and tired of being called 'paranoid' whenever I say it's obvious this is what the NSA is doing with their enormous data centers.<p>This is STILL just the tip of the iceberg. I really hope the whistle blowers continue to release details of more and more of these secret programs. If people think this is as bad as it gets they're in for quite a shock. Call metadata, all your private files, and the people you stalk on Facebook are nothing.<p>How about access to your laptop's webcam and microphone? How about the two cameras and the microphone on the smartphone you carry with you everywhere? How about the exact GPS location of your phone every minute of the day? How about aggregating the CCTV and traffic camera footage with facial recognition to give a full video/audio recording of you everywhere you go every day? How about all of your credit card purchases aggregated, plotted on map, used to determine your habits?",1370559515

It is beyond me how Americans continue to believe in a political system so cynical and so corrupt that allows a corporation to gather so much data about private citizens without any oversight whatsoever.<p>What is Google doing with the data? Who has access to it? How do they make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands?<p>And if you say the difference is that you're surrendering your data to Google voluntarily, I'll say it's not that different from what you do with the phone companies. What you had here was lack of information. You simply didn't <i>know</i> the government was collecting your data. Well, now you do. Most Google users aren't aware that Google is actively scanning and analyzing their information either. The only difference is that the US government owes the people an explanation, while Google reports to no one, as long as its egregious widespread surveillance - which, BTW, is on a much bigger scale than this NSA business - is considered legal. The only reason Google gets away with it is because people either don't know, or would rather not know how their personal information is used by Google (I would add ""against them"", but that is a metter of opinion).",1370559382

Gnu C has something called __builtin_strlen which is a compiler extension that can replace the function calling a statically allocated string with just its length[1] making it essentially zero overhead. Second, strlen is defined with  __attribute_pure__, which means that the compiler can optimize to just one function call in all other cases[2]. With these two compiler optimizations, C is at least as efficient as C++ in worst cases, and much better otherwise.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html</a>

The training, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to what would be given in a vocational school or academic educational instruction; 
2. The training is for the benefit of the trainees; 
3. The trainees do not displace regular employees, but work under their close observation; 
4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the  activities of the trainees, and on occasion the employers operations may actually be impeded; 
5. The trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the training 
period; and 
6. The employer and the trainees understand that the trainees are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training.

Pay them a graduate starting salary for the duration of their internship.<p>2. Make sure we had the time to invest in helping them grow before going back to university rather than just giving them shit jobs or using them as cheap labour.<p>Unfortunately number 2 was derailed by the fact that we took a full time graduate on and felt that this combined with illness meant we couldn't guarantee the mentoring that we wanted to provide. We felt that we couldn't do right by the intern we wanted, so we postponed the programme.<p>We set up a hack week for next month in order for our geographically disparate team to get some time together and some proper training. In addition to bringing the team we invited both the intern we had to cancel and the student we wanted to intern with us for next year (as we found him this year but he was a year early). Our plan is to spend a week breaking stuff and training each other up on core pentesting areas. The students get to come along and join in on that as well as take part in ad-hoc hacking sessions. Both students took us up on it and we're covering their costs. Our not quite intern will probably be offered a job around graduation time, the other lad will almost certainly be our paid intern next year.<p>There's a right way and a wrong way to do internships. If you can't do it the right way I believe you shouldn't do it at all.<p>By all means offer them opportunities if they're genuine, but don't dress them up as internships. Just be straight with them. The students attending hack week will go back to Abertay Uni to do their ethical hacking degree projects having spent the week living with a pentest team and hacking all the things, something none of the other students will have done. While they haven't been paid they won't pay a penny for the week. I will reluctantly let them chip in for beer if they insist, but everything else is on us. It just wouldn't be right any other way.",1370559177

5835706,comment,5832626,5835506,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"The thing is, there are excellent reasons for the current interpretation based on precedent. Although I'm quite liberal, I partly agree with conservative legal scholars that the Warren court engaged in quite a bit of legal overreach during the 60s with cases like <i>Griswold</i>, interpreting the Constitution so broadly that legal argument ever since has involved too much rhetorical trickery and too little straightforward explanation of the Constitution. We spend too much time on increasingly strained arguments about what the language of the Constitution means, which would be better spent on building a public consensus to amend the Constitution using clear and unambiguous language, eg inserting an explicit constitutional right to individual privacy rather than 'discovering' one in the 'penumbras' (shadows) and 'emanations' of other constitutional protections like the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.<p>Of course the problem with rewriting the Constitution every time you have an idea for improving it is that after a while you end up with the sort of Constitution we have in California, which is less a collection of guiding principles than a heap of legislation on steroids: <a href=""http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html</a><p>At bottom, what you have is a set of conflicting imperatives. It's perfectly reasonable to charge government with the job of protecting people from military attacks, and as we saw in 2001 the costs of failure to do so can be truly severe. The opportunity costs of investing the government with broad powers to prevent such attacks are much harder to quantify. I have to say that I think the 'war on drugs' has been legally and practically far more destructive of liberty than the Patriot act or the NSA (but please don't interpret this as an endorsement of the latter). I don't worry about top-down totalitarian government nearly as much as I do about the inexorable economics of privately run prisons and city and county pension gaps. People don't care as much about the liberty of crack- and meth-heads (since drug addicts stereotypically have little consideration for others), so we craft these overbroad laws intended to protect the legitimate interests of good people by scapegoating ne'er-do-wells.",1370558859

You had this level of standard support on one platform, but only that level of standard support on that other platform. From STL to every other useful library.
It made things difficult to port.
But that was long ago, before I stopped using C++. Things may have changed since then. Platforms have become fewer and far in between at least.
C is widely implemented on all platforms and in fact, most platforms have large chunks implemented in C.<p>The other thing is about class-based languages. They are great for implementing <i>hierarchies</i> of concepts, like GUI toolkits and a few other things. But, they do promote bulk and it's not rare to have a lot of object thrashing. That's not specific to C++, though.<p>Third, system-level library are often exclusively exposed via C libraries. Core things like BSD sockets, POSIX threads, memory management. Yes, you can wrap them in C++ or use C++-based libraries that add sugar on top, but more often than not you end up wondering ""why don't I use the system APIs directly?"" You often feel like you have to jump through unnecessary hoops when you don't.<p>Just my opinion, of course.

5835453,comment,5832320,5832320,14,0,tokenadult,,,"Rayiner mentions the Federal Rules of Evidence in his comment. Also writing from a lawyer's perspective, I'll mention the elaboration of rules of evidence that has developed both in formal rules like the federal rules and in centuries of common-law tradition in deciding cases. Presentation of evidence at trial is about letting the fact-finder (sometimes a jury, sometimes a judge) hear from both sides in an adversary proceeding about what happened, and why what happened matters. Some forms of evidence are ""prejudicial""--that is, they are excluded from even being mentioned at trial because they trigger known human cognitive biases. Other forms of evidence are ""irrelevant""--even if they are completely truthful, they bear no legal or logical relationship to how the case will be decided based on the other evidence at trial. Unlike Internet arguments, court trials also exclude some forms of highly relevant evidence to protect other social goals, for example by reducing incentives to police misconduct or violations of privacy.<p>In law, there is a well developed body of precedent and rule on evaluating the credibility of witnesses. To show evidence that a witness has reason to lie (not just that the witness is directly contradicted by someone else's testimony) is highly relevant in most trials. If you are a lawyer who has ever read a case transcript, you will have no trouble believing that some witnesses testify in court under oath and penalty of perjury, with cross-examination by the other side, and yet still lie. This happens every day. To put some balance into a system in which any witness might have an incentive to lie, the rules of evidence at trial allow introduction of evidence that the witness is, for example, someone who has been convicted of ""crimes involving dishonesty,"" or has a financial interest in a factual issue under dispute, or so on. Some statements about a witness are plainly irrelevant, even under that principle. It will not do to say ""The witness was convicted of jaywalking,"" because jaywalking is not regarded as a crime that shows a tendency to be untruthful.<p>Another aspect of the law of evidence that has heavily influenced my thinking about what people know and how they know it, and thus influenced my behavior in online discussion, is ""basis of knowledge"" considerations. (I sometimes explicitly mention my basis of knowledge when commenting in some threads. Here my basis of knowledge is having studied the law of evidence with a professor who literally wrote the book on the subject<p><a href=""http://www.evidencecasebook.com/author2.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evidencecasebook.com/author2.asp</a><p>when I was in law school.) If a witness testifies, ""I saw him shoot the victim,"" and you can show that it was dark on that occasion, and the witness has bad myopia and wasn't wearing his eyeglasses, you are a long way toward undermining the witness's testimony on completely legitimate grounds. I am often puzzled why many Hacker News readers are so credulous about stories when it is plain that the person writing the story has no basis of knowledge adequate for making the extraordinary claims submitted with the story. (University press office hype about the future implications of preliminary research findings frequently has this weakness,<p><a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1174"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1174</a><p>as is well known in the scientific community but still too little known here on HN, much less Reddit.)<p>When a Hacker News commenter suggests that someone has either bias (perhaps as an investor in a company) or insufficient basis of knowledge (perhaps as a rookie investigator before peer review and replication has happened), altogether too many HN replies will accuse the commenter of an ""ad hominem"" argument. They don't notice that arguments about bias and about lack of sufficient knowledge are even completely legitimate aids to truth-finding on controversial issues. Yes, don't rely on a list of fallacies (at least, not on the list alone) to guide your thinking, but also on deep thinking about the structure of the argument and adequacy and impartiality of the data.<p>(All of the above said, I like the late Carl Sagan's baloney detection kit on the whole, and think applying it to more Hacker News threads would raise the level of discussion here. See also Paul Graham's essay ""How to Disagree""<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a><p>for more suggestions about how to disagree thoughtfully and productively.)",1370556226

Additionally, a search reveals other decently upvoted DF submissions within the referenced time period.<p>Nice to see DHH spouting off some <i>stuff</i>. (I'm sure he'll apologize as soon as he realizes he and Gruber are simply confused) [DHH : HN :: Adrian Chen : reddit]. They ought to just leave well enough alone. Everytime they open with a blanket dismissal and comment on the participants of a site like reddit or hacker news, they really just make themselves look like angry resentful people.<p>I swear to God, I hope I never have the ego and name recognition that these people do. The paranoia that must cause someone to worry about their site being blacklisted from here and then assuming that a project they're involved with is ALSO blocked... is just a tad amusing.

Just three percent.""<p>Sure, but what was the prior distribution of teams seeking funding?  If only 1% of the teams seeking funding were all-female then it could show a bias in favor of women.  I doubt that is actually the case, but just showing a skewed distribution doesn't prove sexism.  I could make a similar case to the race issue.  I don't know how to interpret the last graph, but it does appear to show some genuine bad news for African Americans.  How to fix it?  I don't know.  Infographics might not be helping a whole lot, but if there is a serious issue that they are raising awareness towards then it's a good thing.  If they're crying wolf for a non-issue then it's a bad thing.  I suppose it's up to the individual to decide for themselves, but I hope they are more thorough in researching than just looking at three infographics.",1370556179

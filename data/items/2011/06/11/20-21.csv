2644841,comment,2644458,2644791,7,0,tptacek,,,"PEG is a different way of specifying grammars and an different process for parsing them. If you're used to Bison/Yacc or LALR parsers modeled on Yacc (like Racc), the big things you notice with any PEG parser are:<p>* You automatically get ""EBNF""-style operators like ""zero-or-more"" or ""one-or-more"" instead of having to specify recursive nonterminals and epsilons.<p>* You typically don't need a separate lexer; PEG parser productions resemble regular expressions.<p>* PEGs use prioritized choice to deal with ambiguities such as dangling-else. PEG grammars are unambiguous.<p>PEG parsers are much easier to build and work with than Yacc-style parsers. The learning curve on PEG is also way, way shorter than for shift-reduce parsers. You should probably be using PEG parsers whenever possible now.",1307825822

2644815,comment,2644169,2644595,4,0,nhaehnle,,,"> I'm fairly certain that a contingency plan exists if Greece defaults. I'm also fairly certain that there's a report somewhere in the IMF stating that the chances of a Greek bankruptcy are greater than 30 or 40%. If these plans were to be made public Greece would default within a week, and wreak as much if not more havoc on the world economy than Lehmann brothers.<p>The markets are no longer involved in financing the spending of the Greek state. Therefore, whether or not such information is made public would make no difference to the solvency of the Greek state.<p>Note, however, that such information can obviously affect the price of Greek bonds on secondary markets, and there are certainly major private players involved that are very interested in manipulating those prices. But democracy should not cater to such private interests.<p>The truth is that Greece will become bankrupt if and only if the EU does not decide to support the Greek government financially or Greek decides to exit the Euro. Without prolonged EU support, there is no way Greece can dig itself out of the hole that it was pushed into - austerity does not work, but without exiting the Euro or EU support, that is the only option available to them.<p>Whether Greece will go into bankruptcy or not is an entirely political decision, and a decision that is highly influenced by the IMF (although it is ultimately up to EU governments). So if the IMF were to compute odds for an event that they themselves pretty much directly influence, that would be pretty dishonest (or would demonstrate that somebody at the IMF does not understand the fundamental nature of the situation).",1307824916

The article headline is a bit misleading, and should've said something like: Amazon pulls out of CT due to a tax-law change. Even, Terrible CT Tax-Law Change Drives Amazon Out, or something. As it's written, I thought that CT had banned affiliate programs; in a rush to editorialize, the headline author sacrificed clarity about agency. Of course, maybe everyone reading is already following the saga, so I was the only briefly confused person, but nonetheless it seemed like an easy problem to avoid.<p>2. Amazon is probably pulling out in part due to, as you say, a feeling that this would set a negative precedent for their business, not solely due to the CT case taken in isolation.<p>Your slavery example seems off the mark; Amazon is not taking action due to <i>moral</i> opposition to CT's tax policy, but because it's bad for their business.

The long term strategy is to put a stake in the ground, then continue to lobby and work at the national level. This sets precedent, even if it doesn't work.<p>Third, there's a lot of ignorance. You don't have to pass an economics test to become a legislator. I think sometimes in any group that deals with another group there's an ""us versus them"" mentality that takes over.

So with my current architecture it would be difficult to implement the functionality you describe but I agree that it would be cool. Smugmug's photo uploader has a similar feature; I should look into how they do it. (Or if anyone knows or has an idea, feel free to chime in!)",1307822774

The options I found were the the Dell M6600, Lenovo W520, and System76 Gazelle. System76 had the greatest range of options available and the lowest overall price. The best part was that the options were priced near their cost; going from 4GB to 16GB of RAM added only $280 to the cost compared to $480 from IBM and $800 from Dell.<p>I haven't made detailed comparisons, but I expect System76 would be competitive for more mainstream laptop configurations as well.",1307822705

It seems especially bad that Mr. Lamb chooses to misinform people about psychopathy under the guise of clearing up misconceptions about psychopathy.<p>Now that I notice he lifted these words from the Scientific American article he linked, I guess I can only assume that he didn't know that he was misinforming people.  I would prefer that a distinction be made between the characteristics necessary to be a psychopath and the ones that commonly occur in psychopaths, so as to make a better impression of psychopaths in the mind of the reader.",1307822607

The fact that he didn't care to do that and then complained bitterly about it suggests that's not really the problem. He could have spent less time than it took to write the rant on the front end to end up happy.<p>All hardware just works isn't a quality linux has ever suggested applies to itself. But that is hardly rare for an OS. The only OS that applies to is Windows (generally) and that's because that's the only platform all vendors bother to target. You can't buy arbitrary hardware and expect it to work at all under OS X, Free BSD, Solaris, Android Open Source Project, Windows Mobile and iOS.<p>In fact, out of that whole list the odds are that an arbitrary hardware configuration will work out of the box are highest on linux.<p>If you want any of those platforms to work well with a new purchase you have to determine beforehand the compatibility. So linux is hardly some sort of freak in that way.<p>But don't let that get in the way of a good rant.",1307822525

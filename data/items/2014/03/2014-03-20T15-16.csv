I&#x27;ll read about open source vs free software, but I think you know my view: I&#x27;m against IP because I&#x27;m against legal fictions, because they violate natural property rights.</i><p>No one is forcing you to become a member of New York City or your particular town or state. You can move.<p>What anarchists are really lamenting is the lack of available space where people havent set up a group with a government. That just goes to show how it emerges naturally out of other states, which can briefly be described as close to anarchist. And sometimes those states arent so glamorous.<p>Anyway it&#x27;s the same in software. It takes massive effort to build a system that is completely free for everybody. That is what the Free Software movement has done. But they are besieged at every turn by PRIVATE, proprietary interests such as businesses who lick their lips and want the &quot;freedom&quot; to use the software those guys built to RESTRICT the freedom of THEIR users. So the Free Software Foundation and its allies have a great ally in the US government and copyright laws! They use them specifically to banish infringers who would use software licensed under GNU License for example without giving their users freedoms.<p>Interesting? Government helping keep people more free. Thats what happens when the perps are private companies and not governments.<p>And to address your point - it is just as hard to move away from Windows and Mac, or from Android, iPhone and Blackberry all of them etc. as it is for you to move from the United States. Sure it&#x27;s possible. But first you need a massive effort to build a natio-- err I mean a platform that is based on principles of freedom. And along the way you will need the help of governments to defend it from people easily coming in and ruining the whole thing because they were &quot;free&quot; to take what you built for their own selfish interests.<p>The dynamics are almost exactly the same! But it&#x27;s an interesting case study because software battles are virtual, hurt less people, and softwrae moves really fast. Yet you can actually see the problems that would happen with anarchy without enforcement.<p>Even today, the free software movement is developing new licenses to combat a new threat: hardware that will only run an approved version of an open source program.",1395331054

7436321,story,,,1,0,kablamo,"Ask HN: Consultants, what problem are you solving for companies?",,"TLDR: I am wondering how to go from contracting at $65 per hour to consulting fees based on the value I provide to the company.<p>One thing that stuck with me when reading Sebastian Marshall and patio11 is the idea of charging weekly rates.  Sadly I don&#x27;t think it applies to me.  I think the key issue is I am not solving the right kind of business problem by marketing myself as web developer.  There are lots of web developers so I am somewhat of a commodity.  In effect I am selling my hourly programming labor.<p>What I need to do is find a business problem I can solve and market myself as the solution.  Then I can charge based on the value I am providing rather than the hours I am putting in.  If I can show I provide $100,000 of value then I could maybe charge $6,000 a week and how much time I spent working would be less relevant to the client.<p>The above outlines my understanding of the difference between a consultant and a contractor and why consultants are paid more.  My understanding is consultants provide a solution to a problem whereas contractors provide raw labor.  I think of it as a spectrum between labor and product.  Consultants are closer to being a product rather than labor.<p>So I&#x27;m looking for examples of how other people market themselves as consultants rather than &quot;programmer labor&quot; so I can come up with my own idea.",1395331034

7436319,comment,7435601,7435601,2,0,etiam,,,"Sorry to hear about your plight.\nFrom what I understand recovering from burnout takes time. Are you prepared to put other things aside and focus on getting well again?\nThere is an account of how Richard Feynman dealt with his burnout that I find is well worth reading. It&#x27;s available in the later part of the chapter &quot;The Dignified Professor&quot; of &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot;. Excerpt here:\n<a href=""http://just.thinkofit.com/feynman-on-work-and-play/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://just.thinkofit.com/feynman-on-work-and-play/</a><p>While disappointing in a way, the advice to eat and sleep well really is important, and it would be easy to underestimate to what extent.<p>I have it anecdotally from a very competent physiologist in the field of sleep research that when they were studying burnout they have found no exceptions to disturbed sleep in the sufferers. Sleeping well is about more than just getting your hours in. The quality of sleep can be very low without the person subjectively noticing micro-awakenings and disproportionate time spent in shallow sleep phases. If your conditions permit I would suggest getting in touch with a sleep laboratory and request their help to evaluate the quality of your sleep and if necessary their help to improve it. In many cases these would in any case be people with much knowledge about stress and hormonal systems; well worth talking to. If you can&#x27;t get access to such a place, maybe you could get an indication from DIY approach.<p>About the food: I don&#x27;t expect this to be a popular opinion with you or with much of the community in the Valley, but I&#x27;m of the opinion that a vegetarian diet, unless incredibly well conducted, does not help, but is detrimental. \nI say this as someone who is a tentative proponent for &quot;evolutionary nutrition&quot;/&quot;paleolithic diet&quot; or whatever you may want to call it. My suggestion would be reading up on that and trying it for a few weeks. At a glance it would involve dropping intake of grains, dairy products, refined carbohydrates (especially sugar), legumes, and keeping salt íntake much lower than most westerners. Switching diets, especially from vegetarianism is a step most people would not accept, so my respect if you try it, and you have my understanding if not.<p>It&#x27;s becoming increasingly clear that states like depression have a strong connection to inflammation. That&#x27;s relevant for both the food and sleep components, but it may also be worth trying to suppress inflammation a bit and see if that helps. Preferably get medical professionals help setting the regime, but an easy one would be trying paracetamol with ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid for a week or two (check their instructions, I can&#x27;t remember the upper time limit for continuous intake without special measures)<p>If you have a hard time with sunlight, I would advice trying to change that. At the very least, make sure your vitamin D levels are sufficient. You may wish to consider supplementing.\nStrong light also helps setting and maintaining the circadian rhythm, which is of importance in this context.<p>For many people, physical touch may help. If it suits you, seek out activities that promote that.<p>You mention you spend much time thinking of negative past events, and I think that may be an important and insightful observation. If you&#x27;re not already aware of it, please look into the research on psychological time perspective pioneered by Philip Zimbardo and John Boyd ( see e.g. <a href=""http://www.thetimeparadox.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thetimeparadox.com/</a> , <a href=""http://fora.tv/2008/11/12/Philip_Zimbardo_The_Time_Paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fora.tv/2008/11/12/Philip_Zimbardo_The_Time_Paradox</a>). The interventions they suggest to change the proportions of use of time perspectives might be helpful.<p>Not directly related to you symptoms, I might add that I think there should be no end to the &quot;learning phase&quot;, so if you&#x27;re doing it right, that&#x27;s the only time possible to get burned out. There is no deadline. You never need to stop learning.<p>I hope you recover well. Good luck!",1395331013

7436312,comment,7435720,7435720,2,0,EGreg,,,"For the record I am more of an open source guy. I think tools are used by people in all sorts of ways and I care about how good they are and that they should gently encourage the right kind of culture. Free software is about liberty as the foremost social value and derives everything from there. It would be interesting to many laissez faire market advocates that almost all the Free Software advocates are extremely leftist civil libertarians.<p>In fact the whole thing might not compute for anarcho capitalists because the main enemy of Free Software -- which is restricted or unfree software -- is produced and used, not by governments, but by corporations. You might realize why they are so leftist and why they actually use the copyright laws to ENFORCE software freedom (an interesting twist!) when you realize that their main enemy is privately held companies who build large platforms on top of proprietary codebases.<p>I am for open source for practical reasons, they are for free software for philosophical reasons. And lookit: The PRIVATE COMPANY (which anarcho capitalists so admire as the outcome of a completely laissez faire society) is in fact the government over its little jurisdiction, which is the proprietary installed code base that people have. Such as the Bloomberg terminal, or Windows or the iPhone. In many industries, you have to pick one of several companies and they all are run as feudalism. They grant certain favors to some app developers and not others. You can&#x27;t just deploy apps you write on them.<p>The exceptions are Linux and the Web, etc. Which have in fact become the most widespread operating system and platform, respectively. Linux and other open source software did it using licenses on their code that USED GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT THROUGH COPYRIGHT to prevent the software being used by companies to lock people out. The Web did it through a culture of openness where every user could View Code and browsers had to conform to standards of bodies like W3C and WhatWG.<p>My point can be summarized as usual: people create groups, and if it&#x27;s not governments then it&#x27;s companies. Someone will always be lording it over others, creating barriers to unrestricted freedom. And the most we can do is have systems to guide things away from terrible abuses of power.",1395330990

7436296,comment,7435720,7435720,1,0,yeukhon,,,"To begin, my position on this matter has been clear for years: both free software (as defined by Stallman) and non-free software (as defined by Stallman) can co-exist. I believe in free market (not ideal free market).<p>--><p><i>For the free software movement, however, nonfree software is a social problem, and the solution is to stop using it and move to free software.</i><p><i>We in the free software movement don&#x27;t think of the open source camp as an enemy; the enemy is proprietary (nonfree) software. But we want people to know we stand for freedom, so we do not accept being mislabeled as open source supporters.</i><p>These two quotes strike me. Why should we label proprietary software as enemy?<p>If we clone all proprietary developers to work on free software alternatives, then we definitely have more options to choose from. The problem is not a social problem -- it isn&#x27;t that people, average like my parents, don&#x27;t know free software exists - but because there aren&#x27;t enough to choose from. Like I said, if you can clone all of the developers to work on free alternatives every day, you will definitely have free alternatives. If you only have a handful of people working part-time as a hobby to contribute to free software, how can you compete with proprietary software?<p>I am not against free software. I like free software (as defined by R.S). I like open source. I also think proprietary softwares have value. Note here on HNs a lot of people run <i>X-as-a-service</i>. In the ideal world, if everyone knows how to program, if everyone has access to a computer, if everyone has time, we could have the old Internet back; imagine a world where everyone can write, distribute and host their free <i>X-as-a-service</i> for people to use? That&#x27;s why knowledge base like Wikipedia is important to us. I like this ideal world, but at the moment this is not easy to achieve.<p>You don&#x27;t need to teach me to use free software. If it is free and open source, and reliable, I will use it. But if the interface is ugly, unusable, crashes all the time, and if there is no reason for me to contribute back (say an IRC client), I will dump that software and look for something else. I am a programmer, but I am not going to contribute to every software I use. I don&#x27;t have the time. I don&#x27;t have the necessary skill. I have more important things to do like finishing my work, looking after my family, relax, cooking, working on my hobby project, and getting enough sleep.<p>--><p><i>But software can be said to serve its users only if it respects their freedom. What if the software is designed to put chains on its users? Then powerfulness means the chains are more constricting, and reliability that they are harder to remove<p><delete chars><p>Sooner or later these users will be invited to switch back to proprietary software for some practical advantage.</i><p>This is a good time to re-mention MS Office vs LibreOffice/OpenOffice. I am fine with LibreOffice&#x27;s Word processor and PowerPoint program until I need to do something complex. If I just need a quick PPT or a quick doc I can get away with LibreOffice. But when I need something complex, polished, I like to use MS Office. True I have been raised to use MS Office since I was a kid. It is true MS is locking me in all the time, but it is simply because the features in LibreOffice is still lagging behind. I will be happy to dump Office completely if LibreOffice continue to improve.<p>--><p><i>Under pressure from the movie and record companies, software for individuals to use is increasingly designed specifically to restrict them. This malicious feature is known as Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) (see DefectiveByDesign.org) and is the antithesis in spirit of the freedom that free software aims to provide. And not just in spirit: since the goal of DRM is to trample your freedom, DRM developers try to make it hard, impossible, or even illegal for you to change the software that implements the DRM.</i><p>I don&#x27;t want to start a flame war on DRM. This is as dirty as complex as politics. After reading the FAQ on <a href=""http://www.defectivebydesign.org/faq#what"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.defectivebydesign.org/faq#what</a> I will point out a few striking remarks:<p><i>If you purchase electronic copies of games from Steam, you can&#x27;t sell them or share them with a friend after you&#x27;re done playing them.</i><p>I don&#x27;t see this as a violation of my freedom. If the license given to me is restricted to my account, why is it okay for me to distribute it to my friends and everyone in my friends&#x27; circles? The other examples may be violation of freedom, I won&#x27;t argue. What do you propose? Create a universal gaming platform where you can download games and all you need to access a game is to own an account. Say pay $29.99 and I can run a Steam game I didn&#x27;t purchase but acquire from my friend? If Steam has a feature to transfer game (say only once) but locked to Steam platform, is that a violation of freedom?<p><i>Are Hollywood the one to blame? Not exclusively. This way, all their customers remain dependent on them, and helps maintain their dominant position in the market.</i><p>I think this is a direct attack on anyone who is trying to come up solutions. If you are a solution technology company, your job is to create a solution. Just as Google is an excellent search engine I feel attached to using it because it provides what I want 8/10 times. As a customer of Google&#x27;s search engine, I am okay with Google keeping its dominant position by using the search engine. When Google SE fails to deliver the right results I might use Yahoo, Bing or even DDG.<p>--><p>I feel like a lot of the free software advocates seem to be against the existence of proprietary software and any business depends on proprietary software development. As I have said before, I think both can co-exist. Do I want free software? Of course. I would like to own a free copy of Mac OSX and able to modify from start to finish. But I don&#x27;t think everyone should be told to use free software.",1395330861

I interact with tons of products that I know, in theory, could threaten me because they are closed systems, but I use them anyway. I suspect RMS does the same and I&#x27;m sure he and I try to be cautious and judicious of our use of these things (many others are probably not).<p>For example, I use Gmail. I know that there is a possibility, however remote, that my correspondence could be hacked or used against me in some way, because of the distributed and closed source nature of the program I&#x27;m using. I don&#x27;t care though.

But for $40 you can just buy a new scanner and junk the old one, as wasteful as that sounds.

The majority of users don&#x27;t care about the philosophical benefits of one over the other and are never going to contribute back to the original project (think of the millions of Android/Linux or Firefox users). On the other hand, OSS allows plenty of practical benefits: you can view the source, fork it, often times contribute to it. It&#x27;s often done on good faith. Think of all the projects released under the Apache or MIT licenses which are doing so great. Who cares if someone somewhere is not contributing back: most people that matter do and the license does not hinder them.<p>The GPL is an appropriate license for lots of projects, such as the Linux kernel. Those are too important and too large a target to leave to good faith. However, something like a JavaScript framework of the week does not benefit from being GPL. Also, think of all those BSD distributions.<p>Having said that, open source your technology now. Not your secret sauce, but most of your code can be OSS. No reason to hide the Rails app that runs your site. It&#x27;s not why you are making money, so open it up and let others take a peek.

There is no loss.  He goes to on further detail what you might find confusing:<p>&quot;We must distinguish the practice of selling exceptions from something crucially different: proprietary extensions or proprietary versions of a free program. These two activities, even if practiced simultaneously by one company, are different issues. In selling exceptions, the same code that the exception applies to is available to the general public as free software. An extension or a modified version that is only available under a proprietary license is proprietary software, pure and simple, and no better than any other proprietary software.

Here is a radical thought: Western Civilization hasn&#x27;t reached &quot;freedom peak&quot;. The freedom level can continue to rise or it can decrease. Peasants in the Middle Ages probably thought they were free. We think we are free. How silly do we think those peasants were? How silly will future generations think <i>we</i> are?<p>It depends. If everyone just shrugs their shoulders, then we can easily slide back to the Middle Ages. Freedom is not monotonically rising all the time. What I, who likes computers much more than people, can do to generate freedom is write free software.

However, the italics-mode persisted into the next line. This was the generated HTML:<p><pre><code>      <p>Hello, <i>world</i></p><p><i>Why italics?</i></p>\n\n</code></pre>\nAs a programmer, I can appreciate why this might happen, and I know how to fix it...but this is the kind of unexpected behavior that is the bane of the layperson, so much so that with each new rich-text environment -- whether it be Word, Google Docs, TinyMCE, etc -- they have to come up with a whole new list of hacks to get around these quirks.<p><i>edit: the rest of this is address to a general &quot;you&quot;, not to &quot;you, the Guardian developers&quot;, as in, &quot;why didn&#x27;t you just do Markdown&quot;...though if the Guardian took the lead in that, I&#x27;d most definitely upvote that too ;)</i><p>I think rich-text editors are fine for the <i>very</i> layperson. But I think for professional reporters, there needs to be a move toward the expectation that they all learn Markdown. Note, I&#x27;m not saying that everyone needs to learn HTML...but Markdown is basically the exact subset of text formatting a professional online writer needs to communicate 99.9% of their reportage material, with the rest being made up through plugins/shortcode/embed, as is currently the case for most online CMSes.<p>Markdown can be written in any editor and is portable to a huge variety of systems and services. More importantly, even without a specialized editor, Markdown still has human-friendly structure. What else does a writer need?<p>Before you say: <i>oh but we can&#x27;t expect our writers to learn code-like things</i>...this is not true at all. As an intern at the Denver Post, I spent at least a day learning the in-house editor, which was Windows-only, designed for the print-publishing workflow, and had all manner of arcane key combinations to add editing marks (again, for print, and not the web). Everyone was expected to learn it, and everyone did fine.<p>But unlike Markdown, this in-house closed source coding system was...well, shitty as most industry-specific codes are...and once in awhile someone would accidentally &quot;un-hide&quot; notes meant for an editor&#x27;s eyes only, which would then show up in print. What I love about Markdown is that you don&#x27;t even have to really know it to write what you need...hitting Enter creates a paragraph break, both in your text editor and the platform to which you publish. How much easier can you get?",1395329050

I am guilty of the same thing.<p>Here is where I arrived to so far on this subject from my own reading, thinking and experience:<p>Each person changes over time - they want varying degrees of responsibility, working on new things, improving existing skills, who they want to work with etc. People age and with that their personal situations change as well.<p>Change is inevitable.<p>A company, group of people executing a process which provides value and receives more money than they spend to provide that value, can only survive if it can adapt  to change. Both the change coming from individuals in the company and external change coming from the market.<p>There seem to be almost no companies ( maybe Valve, Semco and few others but I never worked in any of those ) which try to adapt to both the internal changes of their people and external changes of the market.<p>The current situation is this:<p>The rigid hierarchical companies with what Michael Church calls &quot;Closed allocation&quot; fail to adapt to both internal and external changes and then they eventually die. What the guy on the ribonfarm blog called - the clueless take over and the losers and sociopaths just jump ship - then the company dies.<p>In the startup phase, the people make the company change until market fit is achieved.<p>After market fit is achieved, it causes the company to resist any personal internal change so that the achieved market fit can be optimized. If there is no external change in the market the company thrives and can simply replace any &quot;failed&quot; individuals who no longer fit with external ones which will fit. The company puts in place new individuals to fill the rigid self perpetuating hierarchy which can still provide the same value from the market fit. The company does not care if a great female employee had a child and needs to work 4 hours a day - she is underperforming and needs to be fired for the good of the company. Bigger offices need to be leased and a small group of people who now live far away can just quit and be replaced etc.\nMany of the people are not happy but need to pretend they are still the right fit - they just punch in and out - &quot;this is just a job&quot; now.<p>In case the market fit does not last long but the company has made internal changes impossible - the company will die. If there is still possibility of internal change the company might adapt - but very unlikely if this happens after market fit was once achieved.<p>Here is my current solution to this.<p>Recognize that change is inevitable. Embrace it. Create a system which can adapt faster than the change that can cause either personal unhappiness or loss of market fit or profit if you will. The only way to achieve this is to let people inside the company make their own decisions for as much as they are comfortable with.<p>One way is democracy. People vote and tyranny of majority rules. If you do not show up to vote, whatever is voted gets selected. Every decision is put to a vote or voted to be delegated to people with a finite time limit. The limit passes and a vote needs to happen again. You can even vote for a monarchy in case of crisis - have someone make all the decisions for a period of time. The crucial thing is that any vote has a time limit and another vote is forced - to adapt to change.<p>Democracy depends on informed participants. No internal company information can be hidden. Salaries are an example of something that needs to be open. Salaries get chosen and budgets get voted for. You select your salary but everyone gets to vote on the budget that salary is in.<p>Every part of the company should have a time limit - die - and be assembled again. No group should live for more than some time limit without have a vote on who is part of it, what the budget is, what the focus is. Is this done every month, every quarter, every 6 months or a year depends on the situation. But companies need to reinvent themselves.<p>The time limit on votes forces the answer to &quot;WHY&quot;. Is this group needed, did we select the right leader, right people, do we need more, do we need to change the market, product, the janitor ...",1395328992

It didn&#x27;t even come from the FSF initially, but from a developer (Affero) who believed it fit their business strategy better than the existing licenses.<p>One of the traditional business strategies built on the GPL, which RMS does not greatly like, but is quite possible to do, is the dual-licensed GPL/proprietary approach. People who are willing to GPL their own software may incorporate your code under the GPL&#x27;s terms. Other people who prefer more traditional commercial terms can, alternately, purchase a commercial license.<p>In the webapp setting this approach no longer works, because the GPL only covers &quot;distribution&quot;, and a webapp backend is never distributed. Therefore nobody will buy a commercial license. The AGPL more or less restores the traditional GPL terms in the webapp setting, where you have to GPL your product if you ship an app containing the GPL&#x27;d code: only now, deploying a public webapp is a form of &quot;shipping&quot; (which is how most software devs actually do see the situation... deploying a live webapp is a modern-day form of shipping software).<p>And in practice, it seems the most common alternative to the AGPL in this setting is to just keep your code fully proprietary, so competitors can&#x27;t build on it. I think in that sense AGPL is helpful if it encourages more releases, e.g. if it encourages more companies to take the Launchpad approach with their code (AGPL) rather than the GitHub approach to it (proprietary). The other common alternative is to release the source but under a non-OSI license like &quot;free for noncommercial use only, commercial users must buy a license&quot;. The AGPL seems at least more generous than that.",1395328537

Presumably they&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s worth having a slightly higher fixed cost per GB in exchange for a reduced ongoing cost per GB. (There&#x27;s probably other benefits as well, such as reduced workload and just getting the space online now.)<p>Let&#x27;s take a look...<p>They do have an oldish post on hosting costs:\n<a href=""http://blog.backblaze.com/2011/07/20/petabytes-on-a-budget-v2-0revealing-more-secrets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.backblaze.com/2011/07/20/petabytes-on-a-budget-v...</a><p>A rack in 2011 cost them $2,100 per month (it&#x27;s more now, guaranteed). Their racks look to hold about 11 machines. \nEach pod is then about $191/mo.<p>Each rack thus needs 1.375 extra pods at &quot;low density&quot;. That&#x27;s $262.50 a month. Since you now need about 10% more pods, you&#x27;re paying about $29 more in hosting costs per month per pod.<p>Your savings are not $688, since you also need to construct 1/8 pod later. A low-density pod will cost about $2719, with is $340 split 8 ways. So real hardware savings is $348. Hosting costs eat that in exactly a year, and they are certainly expecting a longer life than that. (That&#x27;s 2011 hosting costs, which are certainly lower.)<p>So it&#x27;s worthwhile to spend a little extra for the additional drives. (Of course, if they could get the extra five in with more modest hardware, as seems quite possible, that would be a sure win. But sometimes ease of development/assembly/spare parts wins over hardware cost.)",1395328251

Where are the OCaml scalable severs? Where are all the Scala complex enterprise apps? I&#x27;m not saying there isn&#x27;t any really good software written in those languages, but not nearly enough to prove a significant qualitative advantage.<p>On the other hand, when Java came out in 1995, it took maybe 5 years for pretty much the entire software world to adopt it, and it wasn&#x27;t just marketing: its advantages were palpable and immediately apparent. I think (though I&#x27;m not sure), that C and later C++&#x27;s adoption was about as fast. If 25 year old languages like Haskell, and even 10 year-old languages like Scala, haven&#x27;t shown such an immediate and enthusiastic widespread adoption, maybe their advantages aren&#x27;t that extreme. Instead of those languages&#x27; designers sitting mind-boggled, maybe they should think long and hard about what it is that they&#x27;re solving exactly and how important it really is.<p>I think the problems tackled by more &quot;modern&quot; languages are either not important enough, or their solution is far from optimal. For example, it is quite possible that a good type system could help produce good software faster (though it isn&#x27;t certain either), but that this type system is Hindley-Milner seems unlikely at this point. Pluggable type systems (like the ones recently introduced to that 1995 language, and, I believe, also supported by Kotlin) might actually be a better way to go forward. I also think that some more important advances in programming languages have come not from PL researchers, but from developers (Java, Erlang, Clojure).",1395328006

You just happen to be a developer, no matter how much you would like to identify with this symbol.<p>I was exactly like you at some point of my life. I considered dropping out of school (never did) and started (failed) my startup. And I learnt something. Identifying yourself through the work was killing me. I was a developer and I hated myself. My head hurt and my back was killing me for these hours spent on the chair. I felt like I am cheating myself when not working, everyone I knew almost left.<p>And then epiphany — I just <i>happen</i> to make websites and software. It&#x27;s my way to earn money, I like doing that, but I&#x27;m not 100% developer. Over last few years I started thinking that maybe I&#x27;m not even 10% developer. I&#x27;m a cook, I&#x27;m a dog owner, I&#x27;m a movie fan and music person. Saying that I am anything is like saying &quot;I&#x27;m finished&quot;. I&#x27;m not.<p>And you&#x27;re not finished even though it feels like that. You&#x27;re in your early 20&#x27;, you&#x27;re basically still a child. Embrace it. Being undefined is freedom.<p>Being you I would make a full stop. Rethink. Make a short break to win everything back — go back to school, do a fixer-uper with your close ones. If you loose them now you will never get them back.<p>Be brave and take a step back to make a leap forward, good luck mate! :)",1395327741

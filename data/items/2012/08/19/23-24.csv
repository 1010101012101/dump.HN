But I found out that it was still useful - a number of times, when I had to remember something about the way I solved some particular problem, I searched my own blog and found it.<p>Now it's almost a habit - whenever I do something even remotely interesting, it pops into my head - wait, I could write a short blog post about it in 10-15 minutes.

4405683,comment,4405296,4405296,4,0,aprofessor,,,"The system that people here would like to see disrupted is a system that may be going away by itself. Publishers see that it is going to be too hard to sustain a revenue stream by selling books in the future --- they have been moving to services for quite a while.\nStudents are too good at getting books. My students buy foreign editions at 10% of the US price. They download pdf scans from torrents. There are many ways to find used books. Stupid measures like the ""useless new edition every 3 years"" are just delaying tactics.\nInstead, publishers are selling services, like online testing and homework grading (cf. Pearson partnering with Coursera). These require students to purchase access codes keyed to individuals, and may be harder to get around. (The textbooks are often thrown in for prices around $20. That should tell you where the money is.) The publishers know they have a great market here. Professors hate grading papers, it hardly counts at all toward professional advancement, and it takes time and energy away from research, which does count.\nAll that said, the circumstances described in the original article are appalling.",1345420700

4405679,comment,4405314,4405438,8,0,latchkey,,,"I currently run a online ticketing startup (Voost) for another side industry, athletic events (think bike/running/triathlete races), but I've also owned a fairly large night club in San Francisco. I've had the fortune of seeing a few sides of this industry now.<p>You have a great explanation. I think the key point is getting venues to agree to switch to something else because Ticketmaster/ClearChannel truly owns the market. Heck, they own most of the venues too. One time, I ended up losing a ton of money on a Bone Thugs & Harmony show because a ClearChannel radio station advertised 'accidentally' that we were sold out and tickets wouldn't be available at the door. Nobody showed up. The games they can play are amazingly creative.<p>This time around for Voost, we are trying to buck the trend with ticket sales. We force the promoters to always absorb the ticket fees themselves. The athletes love it because it is one simple price and we've done our best to keep our fees at a minimum. We'll see how it works out in the long run for us, but so far it's been good.<p>Sure, you can make the tickets $1 and charge a $50 fee (which gets kicked back), but eventually people are going to catch on and start complaining.<p>For venue ticketing, I honestly can't fathom someone in a startup really upsetting the industry without playing the same games as ticket master.",1345420615
4405678,comment,4400797,4403489,1,0,garenp,,,"In principle, the usual response to your type of question is that it's a problem that <i>could</i> be solved if all the parties of interest could agree on a standard to follow.  For SQL DBs, there is an ISO/IEC SQL standard (1992,1999,2003,2008,2011), so it's not that there is a lack of a standard.  If you look at the various issues brought up in this thread and other postings, you will find long standing bugs (and waves of duplicates & complaints) that have been filed for all of them on bugs.mysql.com, so it's not that there isn't interest in fixing MySQL;  likely it's just not been a high priority for the project, and the value added for existing apps that already ""work"" with MySQL isn't there.  Also, what motivation is there for MySQL--which is arguably the most popular open-source DB--to change to be more compliant?<p>To answer your question concretely, which I read as: ""Why can't we easily change out a SQL RDBMS as if it were a common component?"" I would say:<p>(1) Lack of standards compliance; in this case the SQL standard being the relevant one that MySQL doesn't follow.<p>(2) DB specific extensions that many apps have become to rely on, often also caused by the previous point: apps having to rely on non-standard extensions due to the non-existence of a standard feature that could have otherwise been used. An earlier poster pointed out a few of these above (INSERT IGNORE, ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, INSERT REPLACE, ...).<p>(3) Due to a combination of both points above, supporting software in your favorite language or ORM either doesn't exist, is incomplete for a particular DB, or lacking in cross-platform support (e.g. the mylang-pgsql driver for Linux works but doesn't on Windows, OS X or some other major commercial UNIX OS like Solaris or AIX).<p>(4) Finally, for open-source DBs there is practically no code re-use that matters; I see this as very unfortunate, because it could be a unique strength that only open-source projects can take advantage of.  One reason for this is legal: different open-source DBs have different or conflicting licenses.  But regardless of that (putting on flame suit now) much of the reason for a lack of code re-use is due to the fact that C and C++ make it pretty difficult to do well--which is a point I find true across all codebases in general (i.e. different C, C++ codebases share very very little code).",1345420610

For intro courses, coming up with good intro materials is a fairly hard problem.

There are corner cases where custom editions make sense, but overall they cause far more harm than good.<p>-The biggest issue is that custom editions segment the global secondary market for a given textbook into slivers of useless fragments. Instead of Campbell Biology, Regular Edition being bought and sold between Stanford students and students at every other college in the country (this significant supply drives the price down), Campbell Biology, Stanford Custom Edition is only ever going to be bought/sold by Stanford students. This hurts students in multiple ways: 1) the bookstore is the only place they can BUY the book from. Period. 2) the bookstore is the only place they can SELL the book too. Custom editions are a perfect storm for bookstores/publishers.<p>-Custom editions are cheaper than what the regular edition costs in terms of what the bookstore would charge for each, but if you compare prices on the regular edition online, there are usually significantly cheaper prices out there than what the custom is being sold for at the bookstore.<p>-In the rare case where a custom edition is being used, but a regular edition is acceptable - the bookstore presenting both options and telling you to pick one will almost never result in you considering that the regular edition would be cheaper online. By adding this extra noise, they artificially make custom books look more affordable.<p>I agree - there are tons of professors that are on the right side of this fight. Textbooks SHOULD be free.

4405633,comment,4405127,4405127,26,0,adriand,,,"I find it somewhat interesting how often people profess that their key to happiness essentially boils down to living the sort of ""good life"" that in many ways is the Christian ideal, regardless of whether or not they are personally religious.<p>Although there are habits and rituals that can lead to a more positive outlook, such as exercising regularly, there are deeper aspects to this way of life.  This includes helping others, which is featured in this article, but also includes dealing with others fairly and honestly (aka the Golden Rule), being willing to put others above yourself (at least part of the time), optimizing for long-term gain (the religious may be looking beyond death but there's also value in a somewhat shorter view), and so on.<p>Add in hard work and self-betterment (""Learn new skills"") and it's not just a Christian outlook, it's downright Protestant.<p>But given the complexity of human nature, surely there are other ways to be happy.  One option, generally only successfully exercised by the very rich, is to engage in constant luxurious pleasure.  In spite of the fact that a majority of the planet's humans likely would be happy to adopt this way of life, we're told that the individuals who do are not actually happy and would be better off living like hard-working American Protestants.<p>At the other extreme is asceticism, which supposedly can lead to a life of satisfaction and contentment, if not happiness, but it generally seems to be a case of extreme long-term optimization, with little if anything in the way of short-term rewards.  In any case, it's not a realistic life choice for me, since I have a family and no desire to leave them behind to live in a desert monastery.<p>So besides living the life of a monk, living the Protestant work ethic, and living the life of a dissolute jetsetter, what else is there that seems to offer a convincing chance at happiness?",1345419558

However, the are a couple of caveats that make them free (in a sense) in my opinion.<p>1. All final content is free (images, videos, html, css, js/json), an anology would be if in a closed src game you had access to use/download all the 3D models, music, dialogs, voice overs etc.<p>2. For the vast majority of websites, all the server-side stuff (the ""non-free"") is built on free / open source technologies, i.e. Apache, postgres, redis, java, ruby, all the frameworks, etc.<p>3. Information about the web / its technologies on the web is ridiculously ubiqitous, the amount of open/free knowledge, documentation, and resources is for all practical purposes limitless.<p>so this makes reverse engineering or understanding virtually any website a much simpler task than non web based software, for instance, ERP systems such as SAP which are closed source and fully proprietary.

But I'd like to briefly (and mildly) chastise the idea for a more abstract reason, if you'll indulge me.<p>The post advocates starting a company in order to build and sell a new software application.  If this resembles every other business app I've ever written or used, the developer will quickly run into a complex set of rules and requirements that is almost impossible to fully anticipate or characterize a priori.<p>The motivation for doing so is admittedly egregious fees charged by an incumbent vendor.  Imagine one is successful in building the app, despite all of the unforeseeable obstacles.  All the incumbent would have to do is lower its prices, either accepting slightly lower margins to maintain the fee pass-thru to its partners or eliminating such fees as the hypothetical startup would do.<p>In other words, the proposal is to dedicate years of effort to a problem in order to compete on price by 10-25%.  This is generally a losing proposition.  If one can achieve a 90% lower price for the same or slightly better functionality that an incumbent will find difficult to match (the famed 10x price/performance improvement), then one may have something sufficient to build a business around, depending on how difficult/capital intensive it is to create the product--ignoring all of the other barriers to adoption that exist in this or another industry.<p>But faced with a narrow price-performance improvement, incumbents can either lower prices or, if it's a functional improvement, invest a similar or lesser amount of capital (they already have employees, a brand name, a salesforce, etc. that a startup would have to build from scratch) to match to the feature set.<p>Don't get me wrong: I don't want to talk anyone out of the desire to start a company, to improve a process or an application, or to return excess profits to the consumer in the form of lower prices.  But part of being a successful entrepreneur is picking the right battles and bringing an unfair advantage to bear against tough competition, something I and many others still struggle to achieve.  In this case, I don't see the unfair advantage or the 10x improvement, and I think we should challenge each other to be hard-nosed realists about where we focus our collective entrepreneurial talents.",1345419168

(Especially if the second is actually syntactic sugar for the first!)<p>""As a result I don't know when or even if I'll learn Haskell - and it's caused solely by the lack of full, up-front explanation of Haskell I/O model in most (all?) learning materials for the language.""<p>The IO monad is just like the State monad, except you can't get the State back out. You're passing around RealWorld. (In any event the ""theoretical grounding of monads"" doesn't tell you anything about IO. It would tell you things about monads in general---monadic bind and return and join, etc. Haskell may be doing weird things with its IO monad, but your objection actually bypasses what I was talking about, which is the category theory shee that Haskell is known for, but is also found in, say, Scala, where IO is not done through a special monad.)<p>ETA: given that these books are apparently for people who might need to be taught about variables in the first place, I wonder how accurate your conception of how like you they are is, and how much that resemblance applies to the case at hand. To reiterate, I can't really understand why any explanation that would pass muster with Zed for adequately explaining how ""for foo in bar"" works in Ruby, including the binding of the name foo, the repeated execution of the body, etc., couldn't be straightforwardly adapted to ""bar.each { |foo| ... }"".

4405581,comment,4404697,4405470,8,0,JulianMorrison,,,"FWIW I learned on BASIC. ""GOTO"" looks natural to me. It's also much closer to the machine. Structured programming is a prettification of test-and-jump, and you have to be able to see through it, to use it well.<p>Functional programming, on the other hand, is a bit of a conceptual leap away from the metal. If you're mapping two functions over a stream of data how many loops is it? In a dumb language like Ruby, it will be as many as your map() calls. But in Haskell, it will fuse them into one loop doing two operations. And the thing with functional programming is, you're not supposed to care - except, you do have to. Generating an endless unresolved series of thunks in Haskell is a beginner mistake. But if you can't see through the functional list-flipping to the generation and consumption of callable heap objects in a test-and-jump cycle, you're going to be scratching your head.<p>My answer would be to teach both assembler and FP, and step up and down simultaneously. Start on Excel and move to Haskell, while also starting on 6502 or some such toy assembler, and moving to C, and meet in the middle at Scheme.",1345418006

4405568,comment,4404697,4405238,3,0,klibertp,,,"Well, I think it depends on the person who you're trying to teach. I, for one, spent nearly two years before I even started learning Haskell, precisely because I can't bear the thought of using constructs I don't understand. In this two years time I learned OCaml, Scheme and Erlang, not to mention read countless implementations of monads in these and other languages, just so I could start learning Haskell.<p>As a side effect (haha) I realized that a) a monad is very interesting and useful concept, no matter in which language; b) Haskell ""cheats"" heavily in order to be able to do I/O (and side effects) and c) it's this cheating (ie. IO part of IO Monad) which makes it hard to understand (I really prefer Clean's approach, where you get explicit 'world' object to manipulate). As a result I don't know when or even if I'll learn Haskell - and it's caused solely by the lack of full, up-front explanation of Haskell I/O model in most (all?) learning materials for the language.<p>So, for me, yes - you need to teach me ""theoretical grounding of monads"" and more or you'll lose me. I never read Zed's books, but I think he's targeting people like me, so your criticism is invalid.",1345417672

This actually is a reason I'd prefer to teach each.<p>On the other hand, I agree with Zed that for is a better abstraction than each, and I disagree that each and for are at the same level of abstraction. If you're approaching it in the abstract, sure, they're both pretty high-level. But each is as close to pure functional as you get and for is plain iterative.<p>And assembly is iterative, so I'd call for better for giving people a sense of how the metal works.

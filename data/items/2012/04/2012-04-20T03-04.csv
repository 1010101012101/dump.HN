Douglas Adams, _H2G2_<p>I've embraced this. Yes, by gum, I will stand in front of a room full of people who have paid thousands of dollars each to be there, I will plow thru the material with gusto and enthusiasm, I will create content on the fly if I have to based on my experience and skill, and if I make a mistake or slam into an embarrassing dead end then I will accept it and use it as a teaching moment to explain that even the best make mistakes or get stuck and that I'll get them a correct answer ASAP and in the meantime we will either start the topic over or move on to the next one. This is reality, this is me, this is what real developers have to deal with, and I'm not going to apologize (per se) for it.<p>No fear. No apologies. Do the best you can in front of an audience because you love the material. If you're going to be inaccurate, then be _definitively_ inaccurate.",1334894215

3866417,comment,3859361,3862429,1,0,foamdino,,,"I'm not seeing where Android has caused fragmentation - which you keep mentioning.<p>Java is by definition fragmented.  Java on phones has been fragmented for ages (pre-Android).  Look at all the competing OS/APIs available for jme phones (BREW, Symbian, BlackBerry etc).<p>Java on phones has <i>always</i> been fragmented at the API level - wilfully ignoring this fact is basically saying that Java EE and Java SE and JavaCard are exactly the same and programs written for a giant cluster of enterprise machines that need to screen scrape terminals and connect to esoteric datasources, should run without modification on a Java capable phone circa 2007 - this is simply not the case and has never been the case.  Face it Oracle are saying WORA is good and Android is killing WORA via 'fragmentation' - the reality is that WORA is basically a myth and marketing hype.<p>Oracle are a troll in so much as they fully supported an ASL licensed version of Java (APIs and vm) when they didn't own Java and then decided that having a truly open source implementation was a bad idea after they owned the IP.<p>Google cleanroom'd (and used libraries which had an appropriate license) - this was expensive and not necessarily the best thing to do - who knows apart from Andy Rubin I guess, but I cannot see how this was illegal, or even morally wrong as you are suggesting.<p>Google could reasonably point to the fact that Apache had been working for 6 years on a fully open source version of Java without any legal problems - why should they suddenly find themselves in trouble for using that software and adding their own vm?<p>Personally I think you're mistaken about the history of this case, who is acting in good faith and who isn't and the realities of developing Java programs for phones and in general.  I'm honestly exasperated by people who seem to ignore the evidence that is in the open about what transpired when and then go on about how 'evil' Google has been over this whole thing.  Google acted in their best interests as a company and what they did hasn't negatively impacted any Java developers that I know about.  The only people that claim that Google has stolen Java or have destroyed Java or any other hyperbolic negative affect they claim seem to have a personal axe to grind and/or work for Oracle.",1334894062

In college, lecturers/professors often deploy it - we students would do the reading & research, then present the topic to the class with interactive questions where possible. (We didn't ever worry about not quite getting it right, perhaps because the prof was there to correct us.) It works fairly well for the actual sub-area you're assigned to work on, but you don't learn so much about your teammates' sub-areas (expectedly).

3866374,comment,3847614,3866293,2,0,iamjonlee,,,"Hey! Thanks for asking. We got about $4.2k in funding in 3 days. While this was a pretty good start, we realized a few factors.<p>1) We weren't going to make our Kickstarter goal at the rate we were going because at the rate the pledges were adding up, we would be short by a large sum of our initial asking $48,000. A good part of the pledges were actually from friends and family so it further adds to the possibility that the Kickstarter goal wouldn't be reached anyways.<p>2) With the feedback we've gotten on HN and other sites, we've realized that we really really need to cut down on our description and go over it again with the copywriter to rewrite it so that it's absurdly simple to understand how our product is different. Nobody is going to read 5 paragraphs of how why you're different and if people keep asking us why we're different, we're doing something wrong with our copy.<p>3) People are interested in the product but not willing to pledge. I got an email from a few people that it sounds like an amazing app but they don't want to pledge because they needed more information (our fault again- our video only showed a very basic view of the app because we had just finished a quick prototype without any features when we shot the video) and so they wanted to see if they could have a beta test or more screenshots of the app before they pledge. If they have to request this of me, again, we're doing something wrong.<p>I've learned a lot with the whole Kickstarter deal in the 3 days it lasted- we're going with an even better marketing plan. For now, we're looking at alternative funding and have actually applied to YC late. As you said, it's not just about the funding. We lack advice and guidance in many other areas. We also lack the connections that YC can offer you with the tech community. If need be, then we'll do Kickstarter again when our point is clarified and people understand what we're about.<p>Meanwhile, we're just improving, revising, and making our overall product ready for launch. It'll be amazing.",1334892386

3866347,comment,3865266,3866297,-2,0,shinratdr,,,"> However I find it amusing that people think the large population of the rest of us to be 'crazy' or some such because we all seem to experience the same problems and can reproduce them very easily.<p>That's not the reason. It's because you choose to bitch about them instead of attempting to solve them, even though they are completely solvable problems that don't happen in a clean setup. Reproducing means nothing, except that you didn't bother to try and solve the problem.<p>> If you have an even slightly large library, it becomes a slow behemoth writing it's awkward binary-xml-shit files every time a change is made.<p>This is just patently false. See my other comment for a detailed explanation. Long and short of it is iTunes doesn't even use the XML file, it exists for 3rd party apps to use. If your machine locks up every time a 30MB file is written (written, not even accessed) then there is something wrong with your storage media, not iTunes.<p>Perhaps you have some sort of 3rd party syncing app that immediately accesses the iTunes XML every time it is re-written? That's more likely than Apple not noticing that their media player locks up every time when accessing a large library.<p>> And no offense, you did not move your library across all those spots without issue.<p>Hard to take offence to something I didn't say. My iTunes library has existed on all of those locations at one time or another, it wasn't the same library every time. Like I said, last time I recreated it was in 2009. It still existed in those locations and didn't randomly reset itself as you claim.<p>> It's frankly not possible. Moving those files causes iTunes to lose it's absolute references to them and you have to do a reimport.<p>Oh no! Exclamation marks everywhere! Click the song, browse to the song, iTunes asks if you want to check the folder for any other references. 5 minute scan later, all pointers are fixed. It's not only possible, it's dead simple.<p>It's almost like you could have discovered that with a simple Google search. Or hell, just actually trying instead of jumping immediately to whining.",1334891401

That's my cost, so i guess I'm losing a tiny bit on my time, setup fees and equipment, but right now, I just want someone to split some of the monthlies with me.  I really, really want that 10G port, though, as at those overages, I can oversubscribe my own commit, and if I oversubscribe too aggressively or one of my customers grows unexpectedly, just paying the overages won't be that big of a deal.<p>Bandwidth gets cheaper all the time, and I've been pestering them forever.  I actually haven't inked that deal, and probably won't if nobody takes me up on it; I really only need about a gigabit, and I can get $1/Mbps bandwidth all day long.   I have to decide by Tuesday or so.  So far?  nobody else seems interested, which tells me this isn't all that unusual of a deal.  One guy I asked went off and is now getting his own line from Cogent.<p>Oh, also note, Cogent just wants the 5g commit from me.   If I'm willing to pay the setup fees $2500 for a 1g port, $5000 for a 10G port)  they will let me have 1G ports at that price;  I just need a lot of 'em.<p>Turns out, though, selling bandwidth is harder than I thought.",1334890958

No. And commentators that are attempting to respond to that point are obviously setting up a straw man for political purposes (hi Nate Silver!). What we have here is blatant evidence of scientists behaving in a closed, secretive, political, and <i>unscientific</i> manner. And that ought to worry people. I am frankly shocked that some are trying to brush this away as ""boys being boys"". In what universe is this acceptable behavior?<p>This is not a call to abandon global warming research. This is a call to shine a little sunlight on it, open up data sets and source code to the public, and get politics the hell out of our science.

954861,comment,954566,954646,0,0,dasil003,,,"XSS is not about the server trusting the client, it's the other way around.  XSS exploits the trust that a user has of a website.  It is the site's responsibility to prevent XSS by preventing any user from injecting executable code into the HTML, because if they can do that on a public page then they can write code that sends the private credentials of all users who visit that page anywhere they want.<p>Preventing XSS is tricky because of the inability to sandbox user-generated content.  Everything in a page has the same security level.  This means if you allow user generated content you need to be aware of <i>all</i> the ways that <i>all</i> the browsers can trigger code execution.  There are numerous tags, attributes, CSS selectors, and url protocols that can trigger executable javascript code, and on top of that there are layers of internal translation in the browser and parsed content such as HTML entities, escaped unicode and other internal browser transformations.<p>So what Microsoft has done, is to attempt to magically determine–without any context–what code patterns look like they were probably submitted by a malicious party, and then perform some opaque transformation to ""prevent"" the vulnerability.  In the process they will undoubtedly break legitimate code, and make the job of preventing XSS more difficult because there is yet another transformation that one browser does differently from the rest.<p>To answer your question, what IE8 has apparently been found to do is translate some non-executable code form into something that is executable, thus rendering something that previously would have been a safe sanitization method across all known browsers into something that is exploitable in the latest version of IE.  Sure it's unintentional, but the whole approach is braindead.<p>If Microsoft wants to further the state of web security they need to pursue a real security model such as real sandboxing of HTML documents, since all it takes is one obfuscated hack in IE8 magic security model to render it useless and more difficult to secure since some percentage of people will never upgrade.",1258833108

954853,story,,,4,1,vlbeta,"Ask HN: SMS deal alerts?",,"Hey everyone, how's it going? My name is Vitaliy and I'm a dealaholic.<p>A problem I've been running into lately is missing opportunities to purchase good deals because I'm not aware of them quickly enough. Currently, I seek out the category that I'm interested in across several bargain sites and add the RSS feeds to my feed reader (Google Reader <http://www.google.com/reader>). On a daily basis, I'll check Google Reader to see if any of the deals match the criteria of what I'm looking for. Unfortunately, by the time I actually check my Reader and see something I'd like to buy, it's usually already sold out or unavailable.<p>If I'm having this problem, I figured some of you might be as well.<p>Anyway, we're participating in an event called Startup Weeekend <http://la.startupweekend.org/> in Los Angeles. The idea is to build a small business with a team of entrepreneurs in one weekend. Out of 45 pitched ideas, only 6 were selected. The entire audience broke up into 6 teams to work this weekend. Our's was one of the six chosen.<p>Here's how we're thinking of solving this problem:
A website that aggregates all the deals across many bargain websites (slickdeals, fatwallet, dealnews, etc). You can create ""alerts"" for certain keywords that you would receive via text message as soon as a deal that matches your criteria is posted. For example, you are looking to purchase a LCD TV, but you have specific criteria that you're looking for. You would create an account and set up an alert for any deal that contains the keywords ""1080"" AND ""lcd"" AND ""lg"" OR ""toshiba"". You would receive a text message notification as soon as a Toshiba or LG 1080p LCD TV is available.<p>I know I would use a service like this, but the important question is, would you?<p>Here are a few of the unknowns we're facing and could really use the community's help ironing out:<p>1. Is this in fact a problem? Like I mentioned, I know I could definitely use a tool like this, but what about you?
2. Would you like text message notifications? Or maybe email notifications instead?
3. Is keyword filtering sufficient? What type of criteria do you guys use to search for deals?
4. We need some way to support this service. Could you envision paying some nominal fee to use this tool? If instant notifications could potentially save you $$$ on what you're looking to purchase, how much would this service be worth to you?
5. Expanding on 4, would a subscription based service be acceptable? Only pay if you actually purchase something? Maybe charge per alert? As much as I'd like to only charge if you buy something, each message costs us money to send and we can't necessarily allow people to receive messages indefinitely. Any thoughts?<p>Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated, because ultimately, we're building this to solve a problem you have.<p>Overview -- 
Problem: missing out on deals because I don't check website often enough
Solution: send me text message alerts for products that match my specific criteria<p>BONUS: in exchange for your input, we'll provide you with a free account once this thing is up and running.<p>Thanks!",1258832865

Almost every set of data can be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on the context in which the data is placed. People can twist and subvert data in ways that are very hard to contradict. It's often easier to sell lies than to sell truths and I sense an extreme fear that they have to spend all of their time defending complicated truths against simple falsehoods.<p>Edit: by which I do not mean they are right and the skeptics are the ones subverting the data and convincing others with simple falsehoods. You may fear your opponent doing that while doing it yourself. The above can be read with the sides interchanged.

954808,comment,953909,953909,0,0,rwl,,,"I honestly don't know what to think about all of this.  I am a new graduate student at Berkeley, and my perspective is undoubtedly a little apathetic because of this:  my department pays my tuition, I haven't been here long enough to experience any substantial cuts in services I use, and the (private) institution I attended as an undergraduate had tuition rates that were around $15k <i>per semester</i> by the time I left.  Things look pretty darn good to me at Berkeley right now, and frankly I was a bit annoyed when, upon arriving at campus yesterday, I realized that someone had intentionally pulled a bunch of fire alarms, forcing me and my colleagues to wait outside in the pouring rain.<p>I can certainly sympathize with the feeling that the university broke a promise to students and staff, and that this is worthy of anger.  I think providing a free, or nearly free, top notch public education is a worthy goal.  It does seem stupid that basic services and staff are being cut but new construction projects are going forward.  But I am not yet convinced that these protests were the right way to bring attention to these issues, and I feel that the harm, inconvenience, and cost that they visited on others was somewhat self-defeating.<p>I wish I had a better solution to offer, but at the moment all I can think of is a meta-solution:  there are a lot of smart people at Berkeley -- why not pose the problem to them, in great detail, and invite them to come up with creative ways to raise money or reduce spending?  A lot of what the protesters object to, I think, is the feeling that decisions are being imposed on them.  Why not instead let us (every individual department, say) make the decisions about what to cut ourselves, with the stipulation that if we don't reduce costs enough, fees will go up accordingly?",1258830893

Oppose the laws, protest the laws, and when that doesn't work, then develop new technology to get around the laws.<p>This is a cycle that has been happening for millennia. It's not new. Authoritarians come into power, then they amass power, and then they attempt to rule by force. Usually, people first welcome their new authorities, because they want order and they naively expect that authorities are on their side; then they begin to become disenfranchised; and finally, they begin to subvert the authority and eventually counteract it altogether.<p>The only novel thing here is the level of technology that we're dealing with now -- but that benefits both sides.<p>Look at China: they've developed probably the most advanced national communications surveillance and filtering technology in the world (depending on how deep your paranoia runs); and while that works for many people, others are still finding ways around it.<p>Or, look at BitTorrent. Media ""authorities"" attack centralized distribution; hackers develop decentralized distribution. Authorities attack centralized tracking; hackers develop distributed hash tables. Authorities attack the protocol itself; hackers develop a new protocol. Authorities attack unencrypted communications; hackers develop decentralized, anonymous, encrypted communications.<p>Eventually this cycle of escalation will lead to distributed networks -- ""guerilla"" wifi mesh networks are already being used in some places -- and the only way the authorities will be able to counter that will be to shut down wired, wireless, and cellular communications for the great majority of the population.<p>How long do you think that will remain popular?",1258830573

The A in ARM originally stood for Acorn, not Advanced.<p>- Writing ARM demos I was always jealous of the Amiga's blitter, but then I discovered STMIA could store multiple registers pretty darn fast.<p>- I chose to go to Manchester University purely because Steve Furber, one of the chip's designers, would be a lecturer on my course.<p>- He spent weeks taking us through diagrams of the x86's instruction decode hardware. I was convinced that any processor that had to expend so much of its silicon just decoding instructions was doomed, not my best insight.<p>- The instructions' simplicity did make it easy to build low-power versions however, hence its ubiquity in mobile devices. Steve seemed as surprised by this as anyone, it definitely didn't seem like a design goal at the start.<p>- His main research project was a clockless version of the ARM chip, with asynchronous logic, called Amulet, really interesting technology that never caught on: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMULET_microprocessor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMULET_microprocessor</a><p>- ARM is the only British-born computer technology company I can think of that achieved lasting international success.

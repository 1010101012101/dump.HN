The Medium article is posted by someone called Sergey Vasiliev Marina Makarova and Andrey Karpov recommend&quot;. I guess it&#x27;s the same Andrey Karpov in both cases, especially as hovering over the name Andrey Karpov on the Medium article indicates that his username is &quot;Code_Analysis&quot; and the original article was posted on the blog of a static-code-analysis company.<p>Seems legit unless someone&#x27;s actually impersonating someone else. I don&#x27;t quite understand why, if Karpov wrote the original article and is a Medium contributor, Vasiliev rather than Karpov should be doing the reposting. (You could imagine something like this: K is a senior technical guy at PVS-Studio, V is a more junior technical guy or is in the marketing department; in 2009 they thought it better to post things under K&#x27;s name to get it out there, but now K wants only the more impressive articles under his name and lets V post the others.

They cannot know for a fact that these WiFi hotspots are within the convention space, they could and likely are, blocking WiFi located outside of that space.<p>To play devil&#x27;s advocate, some APs support rogue triangulation. Ours plot any rogues on a building map so we know exactly where they are. When combined with a proper wireless survey, you could ensure that they don&#x27;t deauth anything beyond the building perimeter. Not that I recommend that, since at the very least someone should be able to tether their phone if they want.

Their phone will be working perfectly, but they&#x27;ll swap out phones for that sole reason. In a case like that, one could simply upgrade their camera component. Same goes with the other components as well, very similar to custom built deskop towers. You have the freedom of taking your time with upgrading components on an as-need basis and on top of that you&#x27;re able to decide how much of an upgrade you want. Top of the line?

Why non-encrypted mode exists? Well, in the past (20 years or more) encryption was expensive and base station huge and bulky, none believed it was a conceivable attack. So they introduced a signal to switch of encryption to increase capacity in emergency.<p>Now you could trick cellphone to switch to un-encrypted and intercept traffic. Why this vulnerability hasn&#x27;t been closed? Many reasons, first of all even if base station are no longer configured to support this mode, they should accept unencrypted traffic for inter-operability and the same it&#x27;s for phones. Furthermore, it makes a lot easier to implement devices like personal base station to enhance network coverage in buildings.<p>Also, there&#x27;s the &quot;next gen&quot; bug. It is almost 8 years that telco company think about 4th gen technology, the LTE network and VoLTE. This is an paper a totally new systems built with new technology and new threat model in mind.

E.g. using things before they even necessarily exist as anything formally in the system. Powerful IDEs like Visual Studio enable this workflow, by giving you a quickfix that will create a method/function if it doesn&#x27;t exist. Coupled with heavy normalization (i.e. 6th normal form) and a nice way of dealing with modeling in that world [1], we should be able to provide a really nice iterative experience. Our explicit goal is for working with Eve to feel almost conversational and exploratory. We found one of the biggest problems with tools like Access was that they forced you to plan everything up front, to define schemas and relationships before you can even do something of value. That&#x27;s a trap we want to make sure we avoid.<p>> I also dislike drawing diagrams on screen when they&#x27;re much quicker to sketch out on paper, but that&#x27;s probably more of a personal preference (and I&#x27;ve not spent enough time with the editor yet).<p>The current editor evolved out of the question of if we could write programs on paper efficiently.

Flask integrates very well with SQLAlchemy and has a great extension for it as well (Flask-SQlAlchemy).<p>- &quot;code that&#x27;s not framework-specific &quot;. Flask is a winner here being micro and you can even build lovely APIs on top of it.<p>- Even though core flask is minimal by design, it now has a matured ecosystem of awesome extensions that lets you rapidly build apps as you need. The beauty is that you are not restricted to one specific way of doing something. Flexibility but that also means you have to make more decisions.<p>Django is great as well but like you said, it is a much bigger framework and more opinionated. Nothing wrong with it but for building large applications, I prefer Flask due to its micro-ness and flexibility.",1439919877

Building out some vigilante feature into AP&#x27;s is completely asinine.  This is like me seeing someone speed on the expressway and trying to pull them over myself. Of course, we&#x27;ll abuse that power if given to us!<p>The FCC needs to up its game. Either allow us to do whatever the hell we want or stop the bad guys. You either have police or you don&#x27;t. This middle ground of outsourcing enforcement to Cisco and Aruba and other deep pocketed enterprise players was, predictably, abused by terrible corporate citizens and puts home users as a disadvantage as their equipment doesn&#x27;t have these features.<p>Or heaven forbid the FCC get off the big donors/money train and strongarm some spectrum so we have more for wifi in the ISM band. How much spectrum is wasted right now on analog radio or other dinosaur services that can be downsampled into bandwidth efficient digital transmissions? Its incredible we have so few bands for our most used infrastructure. Hell, give us channel 14 at least. Figure out a safe way to do this here. We&#x27;re dying for spectrum yet deep pocketed players buy all they need (mobile networks, clear channel, etc). That&#x27;s the core problem  hereand until we get more wifi spectrum, these shenanigans will continue in one form or another. Smart City isn&#x27;t knocking you offline because you&#x27;re some kind of wifi pirate, they&#x27;re doing it because they want to hog the limited spectrum for their convention customers.<p>If pirating ssid&#x27;s were a real problem, we&#x27;d all be proposing an ssl-cert like system to verify identities or at least some kind of web of trust to avoid rogue AP&#x27;s.

The thing is Apple does this and gets business because there was a core of important and vital products and software that got people using Apple for a different reason. So if I buy (as I have) Apple&#x27;s Airport extreme it&#x27;s because I am buying other Apple products. I can&#x27;t say if that weren&#x27;t the case that would be what I would go with.

They aren&#x27;t doing it because they honestly expect and need to sell routers and make money from that or even another play that they are building on that we don&#x27;t know about.

When I wanted to edit the configuration of some software, it was much more difficult than it needed to be because it was already running a custom configuration highly tailored to Fedora. Rather than just finding support online and doing what it said, I had to invest quite a bit of time into figuring out how the software worked, and how it integrated into the fedora system, before having a high enough level of understanding to figure out the changes that needed to be made myself.<p>After just 6 months of using fedora I migrated to Arch. The installation process was slightly cumbersome. I had never configured wifi using anything other than a graphical wizard, and even though netctl is really easy to use, it took some getting used to. Partitioning my drive without gparted or OS X disk utility was daunting. But none of these were too big of challenges, because the beginners guide, and the rest of the Arch Wiki, were so thorough and easy to follow.<p>I installed GNOME and never ran into any issues. Nothing ever broke, except when I installed incompatible video drivers, but that was my fault and easily fixable by booting from the installation disk. Unlike in fedora, almost any software I could ask for was in the official repositories, configured minimally. If it wasn&#x27;t, then it was on AUR. And for the software that no one but I use, creating my own package was so incredibly trivial that it was almost easier than manually compiling from source.<p>A couple months later I added a second arch installation to my machine with full disk encryption (keeping around the old one because I had no where to back up to at the time). And then a couple months I replaced both installations with a cleaner (gummiboot instead of isolinux, luks on lvm rather than lvm on luks), bigger (occupying my whole drive rather than just half) arch linux installation.<p>Just a couple days ago I reconfigured my system to run debian and arch in dual boot with a shared home partition, both with in an lvm configuration over luks. While the debian installer was powerful relative to fedora&#x27;s and ubuntu&#x27;s, I found that I had to drop down into its very underpowered busybox shell several times to acheive the configuration I was going for. In comparison the Arch installer is just a full live arch installation with arch-chroot and pacstrap bundled in to be able to manage packages on a foreign system.<p>tl;dr I think that if you encourage new users to focus on the fundamentals of using linux, the &quot;easy to use&quot; distros will quickly become harder to use than the more &quot;advanced&quot; distros.",1439918853

No one can tell you what those are—that&#x27;s your job as the candidate. But to give you an idea, let&#x27;s say you were interviewing for a 4-person startup. A small startup typically needs generalists who show a lot of passion for the company and their work. Someone who can thrive in scrappy environments without a lot of process and push the company forward in more ways than what you were hired for.<p>Now your narrative should use any relevant experience, even if it were, for example, working at your parents&#x27; pizza shop when you were 15 (in lieu of any actual field experience). &quot;I&#x27;m a naturally self-motivated worker who really thrives in smaller, scrappier environments. For instance, my parents&#x27; local pizza store was chronically understaffed so I developed a process that could combine X and Y while doing Z so that individual productivity went up 3x.

At 10km, you&#x27;re 8m above.  So far, so good.  At 100km, you&#x27;re 784m up.  At 1000km, that support is 78km tall.<p>The only economical way to do even part of it would be to build an evacuated acceleration track up the side of an existing mountain.  The west face of Chimborazo in Ecuador is probably the ideal location for something like that.  But you would need to accelerate at 23g for about 283km (51s) in order to reach escape velocity without any additional boost after the launch vehicle exits the track.  That would be strictly for unmanned missions.<p>Accelerating at 3g for 283km (139s) to a height of 6268m above equatorial sea level would achieve 4080m/s, of an escape velocity of 11170m/s.  You get 465 m/s for free by being near the equator.  That leaves a delta-v of 6625 m/s.  If your launch vehicle used RS-25 rocket engines, that means an extra 13% of your total launch vehicle mass can be cargo instead of propellant.  The acceleration track would effectively substitute for the first stage of a rocket.<p>In order to reach escape velocity externally at 80 km above the equator (7850 m/s), you need 250 seconds at 3g (29.42 m*s^-2) of acceleration, which takes 1850 km.  This is why the launch loop uses tethers instead of towers, and supports itself mainly with tension rather than compression.",1439918519

Eventually I wanted to move to a country with a better games industry and help to make larger games again, so I arranged a move here while working on my own smaller projects at the same time, which you may have already seen on my website and GitHub [which I would have linked as part of my CV/cover letter].&quot;<p>Or something along those lines, shortening or going deeper as in-between discussion guides.

As far as I know, the law doesn&#x27;t recognize concern about exfiltration as a factor distinguishing &quot;legitimate&quot; vs. &quot;illegitimate&quot; use of these features.  It just makes a public vs. private distinction, and the convention spaces in question were considered private.  In Smart City&#x27;s response, they point out that they also provide service in public spaces, and took pains to ensure that users there weren&#x27;t affected.  Is that &quot;illegitimate&quot; in your book?  How would you even craft a law that would prohibit them from doing this, without also preventing the &quot;legitimate&quot; corporate use you mention?<p>Where I think Smart City&#x27;s argument falls down is <i>not</i> that managing the network within their private space is generally wrong or illegal.  Their failure seems to have been that the users whose hotspots they were killing had entered into no agreement not to bring or use those devices.  Had that been a part of the event registration, I for one might have declined to attend, but I also think the FCC might then have been right - per the law - to have decided differently.",1439917287

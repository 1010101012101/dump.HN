6709682,comment,6709466,6709466,14,0,ruswick,,,"I love CSS&#x27;s pseudo-selectors. In my opinion, they are the best part of CSS3 and are generally great.<p>However, I think the author&#x27;s jabs at CSS pre-processors and their adherents are unsubstantiated and a little unfair. I don&#x27;t see how using SASS precludes you from knowing about or using complex selectors. As the author points out, SASS is merely an efficient and more intuitive way to write <i>classic CSS.</i> The good parts of CSS are still the good parts of SASS, and by definition every feature of CSS is a feature of SASS. It doesn&#x27;t really follow that using SASS predisposes you to be less knowledgeable about regular CSS.<p>If anything, people using SASS likely use many more complex styles and work on larger projects, and are probably know more about and actively use more aspects of CSS than do people who don&#x27;t have a need for SASS.",1384138777

6709658,comment,6708664,6709450,6,0,pfisch,,,"I agree with most of this.  I also woke up around 3 today and usually work more towards the midnight-7am time period.<p>The only big problem is that you don&#x27;t seem to have much of a plan to make this sustainable in any way dan.  I think you should try and do some contracting since that is the easiest way to transition away from the 9-5 full time job trap.  While you do that you should also be making your own stuff that you think could generate some revenue and also plan a kickstarter for a separate larger initiative.  Basically do not put your eggs in any single basket but have a larger portfolio to mitigate risk.  The only thing is that you should&#x27;ve been doing these smaller projects on the side for the last year to give you more of a cushion.<p>This is basically exactly what I did in the past year and all of these strategies succeeded for me so I have gotten into a pretty good position.  I now have a thriving contracting business with 2 other employees, a successful kickstarter(we raised around 150k) with 3 other main partners in a separate company, and between $500-1000/mo of passive revenue from some of my smaller projects(to be fair though I have been working on those projects on the side for the last 2 years, originally they made significantly more than 500-1k/mo, they have just slowed down a lot).  I spend my days mostly on the kickstarter.<p>The most important part of this is that any one of them can fail at any time and I will not freak out.  Some of what you do will fail, even if you feel in your gut 100% sure it will succeed there is still a very real chance it will fail.  Some of my smaller projects failed spectacularly.  You need to be prepared for this and have a plan to mitigate these failures.<p>It is not easy to escape from full time work in a sustainable way.  You have to work at it and you have to have a plan.  You also need some luck.<p>Also if you live in san francisco, new york, dc or london you need to seriously consider moving away.  The problem with selling products on the internet is that your earnings in no way reflect your geographical location, and it is much harder to succeed when you are spending way too much on everything.<p>Edit: Apparently you live in London.  Trying to bootstrap in the most expensive place in the world is very hard, I would advise trying to contract locally where companies will be more willing to spend above average for developers.",1384138321
6709657,comment,6708139,6708139,2,0,marcus_holmes,,,"I like it, except for the democracy bit. Voting sucks as a method of making decisions. For quick unimportant decisions, sure, vote. But for important decisions either involve everyone and make it a consensus (i.e. unanimous, everyone has to agree) or give the authority and responsibility to one person.<p>Voting gives every vote the same weight, but some people are more knowledgeable than others and in a better place to know the right course (this is not &#x27;some people are better than others&#x27; but &#x27;some people have more information than others&#x27;). Voting also disables unpopular-but-necessary decisions, which will kill the company eventually.<p>I would replace it by either:<p>- all decisions are made by one person (not the same person for each decision). The management team select three appropriate employees to make the decision, and an all-company vote selects which one will make the decision.<p>or:<p>- the management team will make all decisions, but must provide post a written explanation of the reasoning behind the decision to the rest of the company, and any decision may be further discussed at a company meeting.<p>But that&#x27;s just my thoughts after 5 mins thinking about it... someone else probably has better ideas :)",1384138309

6709588,comment,6708664,6708664,2,0,avalaunch,,,"As many others mentioned, six months isn&#x27;t a lot of time so my actionable advice is to do everything you can to increase that runway while maintaining the independence you crave. I suggest ranking your ideas based on three criteria: how long they&#x27;ll take to build, the likelihood that they&#x27;ll produce an income stream, and the amount of ongoing maintenance and effort it&#x27;ll take from you if the idea seems to be working.  Find the one with the best ratio of the 3 (easy to build and likely to make passive money) and build that first.<p>Also, I recommend you give yourself a hard deadline for launching each idea you work on.  It&#x27;s incredibly hard to launch.  It&#x27;s much easier to push back the launch date so that you can put in just one more killer feature, tweak the look and feel just a little bit, and get that copy perfect. It&#x27;s much better however to just launch and improve as you go.  It&#x27;s a lot easier to determine which features are actually the killer features when you introduce them one at a time instead of all at once.<p>Once you set a date and time to launch, stick to it no matter what. You can always improve on your idea and launch again.  The generally held belief that you only get 1 launch is a fallacy.  If the first launch goes poorly, nobody will realize you launched twice anyway.<p>Obviously how long you should give yourself to launch your idea varies on the idea itself but I highly recommend something absurdly short - like this time tomorrow.  That&#x27;s enough time to put together an minimally viable product.  Plus it would make for a catchy title when submitting to HN.<p>Good luck with your adventure!",1384137145

Before all of that, I was an on-site worker for the first 14 years of my career.<p>I don&#x27;t like remote work.   It&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m not efficient or don&#x27;t get shit done (I am and I do).  My chief complaint about remote work is how it socially isolates the worker.  No matter how many Google Hangouts or morning standups you do, you are losing out on a huge part of the social experience of working onsite.  One of the greatest things about working around smart people is the chit-chat that you get by working right next to them.  I&#x27;m talking about the conversations you have on the way to lunch or standing around the soda fountain.  This stuff is spontaneous and fast-flowing and it&#x27;s precious.  As much as I wish this could be replicated over IRC or IM, it just doesn&#x27;t happen that way.   There&#x27;s something magical about the conversation from four geeks riding together in a car on the way to lunch.<p>The other aspect to social isolation is personal happiness and the desire that most of us have to be in the presence of others.   Over the last six years of working remote, I&#x27;ve gotten really tired of being alone all the time.  Working from a busy coffee shop helps, but you&#x27;re still not chit-chatting and you have to contend with shitty Internet connections and poor security (pack up your laptop to use the restroom, etc).<p>Working remote is not all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  It took me several years of actually doing it to realize this.  I love my job at this awesome company but if I could work onsite and still have my family here with me, I&#x27;d do it in a heartbeat.",1384135857

I stuff my head with the problem before I go to sleep, the next morning I wake up and there's the solution, I even get schedules some times :-), some times I wake up at 3 or 4 with the solution, if it's a curly one sleep can be elusive or I sort of have this twilight sleep where I'm half asleep but working on the problem as well.",1216115611

246520,comment,245935,246387,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"OK.  I'll buy that, and based on a search of the various terms, things seem to be improving.  My personal experience is clouded by supporting our own products, which is possibly not an entirely representative sample.  But, for what it's worth, we have about 1000 paying customers who are web developers...and we're still hearing misuse of the terms on a very regular basis.  I'd like to think things are getting better.",1216115361

246518,comment,246477,246477,0,0,wallflower,,,"> We will work that much harder to prove doubters wrong.<p>I imagine you may be getting a far amount of backlash from older people in your life, namely your parents. I am much older than you and I entertain a fantasy of quitting my job and going to Latin America. At one low point during work, I almost booked non-refundable tickets with a co-conspirator. To show how serious I am about this fantasy (to my family and to myself), I am indulging in 3-5 hours a week of private tutoring in Spanish. The odd thing is that I can foresee myself in a middle ground of not quitting my job but learning Spanish in the States and taking the initiative socially.<p>I do not think your plan makes sense. The odds of success are against you. Most businesses on the Internet are unfortunately or fortunately, all about <i>marketing</i>, only partially about innovation. I'd like to advise you against it, as an older and not necessarily wiser person. Life does not always have to be dive-in, you can dip your toes in the water, wade - if you dive-in, you can drown. In this country, unfortunately, a GED degree is condescended upon and will hurt your academic prospects.<p>Build your startup part time. You have one of the most important ingredients, chutzpah, faith in yourself. But at the same time, L'Chaim (""To Life""). There is more than life than saying ""I did it"". If your parents are serious about you not leaving school, they will cut off funding. And in this country, money is important to maintain a lifestyle. And, if you do drop out and go back to school, you'll fall behind (disconnect with/lose your peer year/cohorts).<p>Maybe some of us are wrong. And we'll read about you in the 3rd edition of Founders at Work. But if we aren't wrong, you might be torpedoing your long-term life with short-term half-constructed disconnected realities.",1216115221

246515,comment,246477,246477,0,0,azharcs,,,"First ask yourself do you really need 24 hours in a day, if not go back to school. You should have a very good reason to drop out. If you are not interested in education or if you think you can survive without it, then drop out. Remember it is all about knowledge, you will have to know more than an educated guy and always be a step ahead of the college educated people to win. If you are lucky you might hire some of the more educated people to work for you.",1216113829
246512,comment,246477,246477,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Public high school in the USA is indeed a waste of time. And, there is no time like the present to start a company. However dropping out can really mess up your life, and I don't mean 5 years down the road.  I mean it can immediately mess up your life. A hacker friend of mine in high school did just what you are proposing, but 10 years ago. As soon as he dropped out of high school his parents kicked him out of the house. Being homeless at age 16 really puts a damper on getting anywhere with your startup.<p>I'm voting for finishing up high school. But, if you're going to drop out anyway, be sure you have some plan to cover all the basic life essentials type stuff.",1216113615
246511,comment,246464,246473,0,0,131072,,,"Don't get too carried away with the hype about Provigil. It allows you to sleep less and may cause a mild increase in focus, with possibly fewer long term effects than amphetamine-type drugs (speed, ritalin, etc). IE Provigil users don't seem to turn into tweakers.<p>It is safer but less effective than good old fashioned amphetamine for actually getting stuff done.<p>If you're just a regular person trying to live a semblance of a balanced lifestyle (for this purpose I will include working a regular 8-to-6 job) the biggest effect of provigil is likely to be to make you say 'so what?'<p>If you are used to the caffeine-shakes and twitches that come at the rough end of an all-nighter, Provigil can take that away to some extent. The psychological price you pay for doing this too often is unknown, though.<p>Having said that, it is useful to get you out of a jam if you stay up partying all night and need to drag yourself to work the next morning.<p>And best of all, if you are in the UK, the NHS pays for it all. In other countries you often have to pay up to several USD per pill and it can take up to 4 pills to be effective.<p>Edit: Based on my experience, I would consider use of Provigil during a true work crunch or crisis that can only be solved by a burst of long work hours. However, if your masters get used to your performance at that level under those conditions, you might learn more about the expression 'burning the candle at both ends' than you want to know.",1216113411

It's great to see that you have a positive attitude, but you did post asking for advice ;)<p>Perhaps you have your mind made up already- But part of the criticism process is taking in what everyone says; I hope you wouldn't just argue against an opinion because it disagrees with what you've already decided.<p>I do hope things work out well for you and the startup.",1216113377
246508,comment,246477,246477,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"drop out only if it can quantify something.  odds are you can finish high school.  dont just drop out because ""gates and jobs"" did it.  Yes, I ""stopped out"" of college with one semester left.  Before, you call me hypocritical realize that I had spent a good 2 years working up to that point. Take it one step at a time, fuck up a lot, learn from it, go fuck up some more, learn more, and eventually it will work out well. As long as you don't factor in <i>""give up"" into those plans, you will be fine. Hope this helps.<p></i>give up means, give up all together. odds are your first idea or vision or even company will not be ""what makes it"". Flexible people never get bent out of shape.",1216112974

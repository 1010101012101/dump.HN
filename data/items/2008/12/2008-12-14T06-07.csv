397271,comment,396804,396896,0,0,mhartl,,,"I wholeheartedly agree, but here's the thing: though what you see is a guy with $100m, he once only <i>had</i> $10m, and bet it all; that's how he <i>made</i> $100m in the first place.  It's only because of his foolish doubling down (combined with good luck) that you even notice him.  Variance plus survivorship bias equals a lot of rich fools risking too much.",1229237576
397270,comment,397150,397247,0,0,thorax,,,"If nothing else, it'll be amazingly useful to make a similar/adapted work from it.<p>I remember a good while ago, there was another game company working on a military vehicle game that went belly-up and released their source code. I was able to use one of their OpenGL libraries for a side project of mine and it came in handy. It was actually just rewarding to use it as a reference when there was so little well-performing example code out back then.<p>My experience with game development shops is that they often have a vision of making engines/tools that they can reuse for other games or the sequel. So there's a good chance there are at least a few libraries (especially closer to the user or to the hardware) that will be reusable.",1229237486

The base hours were 45 and you were expected to <i>be in your desk</i> by 7:30.  They had automatic badge readers on the door which when unlock when your badge got within a few feet of it.  One of the executives was using the data from these to see when people were coming in and wanted to start punishing people for clocking in after 7:25.  He figured you needed 5 minutes to get in your desk.<p>All internet was disabled by default.  If your job absolutely required something you would need to go through red tape to get the specific site you need turned on.<p>Vacation was 1-2 weeks <i>after</i> you finished your first year, 3 weeks after 7 years and 4 weeks after 15.",1229236001

I've got about 500 hours into my app designing it, coding the front end, and doing planning for marketing. The backend isn't even done yet. My partner is doing that and I don't know how many hours he has invested.",1229235940
397256,comment,395970,395970,0,0,mmcelhinney,,,"So I have a personal experience with this idea. I was living in Finland for the past year and a half, and came across this same idea with a site called fiksuhuuto.fi. I didn't have any moral opposition to the idea, because I believe that its no different than any other sort of lottery or game of chance. Adults should have the right to risk their money for the possibility of reward.<p>I was working remotely for a company at the time, so gave them 2 months notice and started developing, with the intention of launching a similar company in Canada in 6 months time. I had another Canadian partner, and started looking into all facets of the idea. The site development went fairly straight forward and allowed me the chance to return to web development after 5 years of Mac and Windows application development.<p>We had contacted the best law firm we could find with experience in gaming and intellectual property. After spending a fairly large sum of money to get a risk assessment, it was clear that the idea was definitely illegal. Because many people were paying for the chance to win a product, it was online gaming and illegal in Canada. We had a few options, none of which were very reassuring.<p>I am rambling now, but I just wanted to mention that I paid nearly $10K to have this looked into by lawyers, quit my job to implement it, and moved back to Canada from Finland to go ahead with the project. I am stunned that this is being done in the US, and am no going to be surprised at all when it goes bad for them. If it doesn't, then I made the wrong bet of calling it quits.<p>On a side note, if anyone wants to buy a nearly completed site with the same idea as this, feel free to contact me.",1229235804

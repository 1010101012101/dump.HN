Often the government is a minority government and relies upon one or more of the other parties to get laws passed. Sometimes coalitions with similar interests appear, and as long as they have a majority they can pass laws.<p>This system has the advantage that minority views are not only heard but also have votes. And since politics is a game of agreements, coalitions and I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine even small parties have a chance of getting legislation passed if they are willing to compromise on something else.

And to do so _BEFORE THE DATA HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE_.<p>How would I trick people into believing a false conclusion? One way would be to find 30 or so measures of what could suggest suspicious patterns. Then I'd test the data with them, and perhaps there would be 2 which have a 5% chance of occurring purely by chance. Then I say ""Aha! Look at this! The chance of these two things happening are .05 * 0.05 or practically impossible!""<p>Apparently I could fool some pretty smart people this way, since they obviously aren't immune to basic statistical fallacy.<p>As another poster said, none of this suggests that the data weren't manipulated, but just that the stats in the article, as given, are purely bullshit.",1245623299

This constrains your life decisions like eating healthy food can be impossible to make not because you can&#x27;t afford the food but because you cannot make the journey to the shop, buying a USD 50 dollar sofa can be can be difficult because you can&#x27;t afford the fuel to travel around town looking for the bargain.  Of course all these things can be done but they require a greater degree of organization of the poor than it requires of someone who already has all that he needs to just decide to buy something with money that doesn&#x27;t matter.

They want to study radicalizing propaganda from other nation states (and to a lesser degree from groups inside the United States) that seek destabilization.<p>&quot;...it is imperative that we develop empirically-based procedures for countering messages that promote violent extremism and anti-Western beliefs...&quot;<p>&quot;...Neural predictors of Twitter impact in Cairo (UCLA & Egypt).

Defense Group Inc. already tracks Twitter trends specific to Egypt and will identify which of the selected Twitter topics went on to be highly influential over the next month and which did not...&quot; - Matthew Lieberman, UCLA, September 30, 2012, Department of Defense MINERVA Initiative [1]<p>The United States engages in targeted mass media and social manipulation to stir dissent in target nations, and to quell dissent where destabilization would hurt policy objectives.<p>Just this past year the CIA (under USAID) pretended to be a grassroots movement on Twitter and served &#x27;news&#x27; critical of the Cuban regime for the purposes of, and that nearly caused, a Cuban uprising.<p>The DoD&#x27;s MINERVA project specifically looks to understand the cultural components of stability of various countries and mechanisms to encourage or disrupt that stability. Among a great number of social studies you will find DoD research on how to seed information inside of specific Asian countries, including China, for the targeted introduction of instability. I will leave speculations of possible connections to the Hong Kong protests to the reader. [2]<p>This should not come as a surprise given the history of the US: The United States and allies are known to target media in other countries to stir dissent. Radio Free Europe, &quot;Voice of Iraq&quot; (cough American), the Lincoln Group infiltrations and partnerships, etc.<p>But now with global interconnectedness it is easy to set up &#x27;foreign media&#x27;, blogs and other politicizing content to influence other nations&#x27; populations.<p>In the past decade it has become a global issue.<p>This year Egypt sentenced Al Jazeera journalists that they believed were partnered with geopolitical interests of other states.<p>Putin&#x27;s administration is now requiring bloggers to register if they have a certain number of readers, so that his administration can curtail international influence.<p>China blocks many American services including Facebook and Google. The usual story in America is that they are censoring free speech. The truth is that they do not want foreign influence to destabilize their population and that they do not want their citizen&#x27;s data in America&#x27;s PRISM program (there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s called the FISA &quot;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&quot; court).<p>The Snowden revelations showed us how intelligence agencies are involved in PsyOps - the term for &#x27;psychological operations&#x27; used by the CIA and others.<p>The GCHQ&#x27;s BIRDSONG/BADGER/GATEWAY/SLIPSTREAM/ETC and partnership with the NSA are used to influence online polls, discussion forums and to vote up and down content that aligns with policy goals. [3][4][5]<p>The giant meta-data graph created by the NSA is also particularly valuable for &#x27;influencer&#x27; and &#x27;social contagion&#x27; analysis (leaks showed they do use it to understand internal chain-of-command and organization structure for target selection). It&#x27;s why metadata matters. A nice illustration of this is the article &quot;Finding Paul Revere.&quot;<p>And so we have issues here with the use of targeted social influence in America as well.<p>A number of journalists have called out that the state has been extremely aggressive to dissenting opinions, even to go so far as labeling current policy on the issue &quot;War on Journalism&quot;. American officials have exported a number of journalists with Middle Eastern descent and journalists like Ayman Mohyeldin have been pulled from Gaza and other conflicts when reporting has erred on the side of other state interests. The crackdown on journalism is worth another post I don&#x27;t have time to write.<p>And of course there&#x27;s the article &quot;I Liked Everything I Saw on Facebook for Two Days&quot;, which is definitely worth a read. Below the thin surface of social information bubbles enormous amounts of radicalizing geopolitical and domestic political ads and campaigns. [6]<p>&quot;Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced self-expression, information seeking, and real world voting behavior of millions of people. Furthermore the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users&#x27; friends, and friends of friends.&quot; - Robert M. Bond, Christopher J. Fariss, Jason J.

As wonderful as the internet has proven to be with connectedness and giving the masses a voice, I struggle to accept that people like Blythe, who abuse their newfound reach, just happen to be the cost of an open online world, not having to bear any consequences for their actions.<p>The potential damage that one person can now cause online is real and substantial.

And there&#x27;s almost no risk involved in participating in such an act -- you are anonymous and not held accountable for anything you do.<p>So while Kathleen&#x27;s response might seem a bit excessive, I can certainly understand why she acted that way.

I could easily afford to buy a USD 1500 sofa, I could even without any impact on my life pay the over USD 4k that the woman in the article will actually pay.  But in fact I have never done either, the leather sofa I have cost me the equivalent of USD 100, in fact it cost me another USD 50 to have it delivered.

I.e. you don&#x27;t have to prove yourself to be credit worthy by paying back debt &quot;they&quot; trust you from the beginning and you can then kill that trust.<p>In the US you often have to get into this weird setup where you have to build debt to show you are good with money which to someone like me is an absurd logic but non the less it&#x27;s the logic we have here in the US.<p>Second. Europe isn&#x27;t really that advanced in the whole point system. Besides airline miles and perhaps the UK system I am not aware of any broad acceptance of points/coupon systems until recently.<p>Third of all. The 3% isn&#x27;t really important when it comes to normal transactions.<p>Where it matters is in the ability for Bitcoin to 1) be a truly global wire transferable currency (there currently aren&#x27;t such a thing) and 2) the ability to do micropayment which BTC will allow for<p>Lastly although the protocol doesn&#x27;t allow for the puritan version that some of the biggest dreamers hope for, using the protocol as an open payment gateway will be a quantum leap compared to the proprietary systems we have today.<p>The reason why you need to build in risk with the current system is because you only need to get in one place to compromise it all.<p>Thats not the same with bitcoin and the very fact that it&#x27;s build around NOT trusting IMO makes it very different and will be the reason why it could be winning in the long run.

1920s some &quot;unregulated banks&quot; were a 
major part of the mechanism that caused
the US economic boom of the 1920s, the 
stock market crash of 1929, the banking
crisis soon afterward, i.e., <i>runs</i> on the
banks, catastrophic shrinking
of the money supply, massive price deceases, 
massive unemployment,
bankruptcies, the Great Depression in the
US, the US slowing buying from Europe,
the Great Depression spreading to Europe,
the great economic stress in Germany, the
rise of Hitler for a <i>command economy</i>,
which actually did get the German economy
going again, WWII, the deaths of maybe,
what, 50 million people, maybe 100 million,
ah, why sweat over few tens of millions of
people more or less (right, Marc?), and, then, some really
severe laws for the <i>regulation</i> of banks.<p>We said, &quot;never again will the banks do that
to us&quot;.  Indeed, from now on the banks
will be creatures of the US Federal Reserve.<p>But, in 2008, with not enough 
regulation, the banks did it to us again.  Hurt a lot
of people, and we got some more banking
regulations.  BTW, we are still cleaning
up the mess the banks left behind,
once again, in 2008.<p>Paulson, Bernanke, etc. remembered with
full clarity and had no doubts:  &quot;Your
banking regulator is sitting right here,
and if you don&#x27;t take this money you
will be declared capital deficient on
Monday morning.  ...  You will not leave
here before you sign the paper in front
of you.&quot;  Paulson, Bernanke were just
determined, as immediately was Congress,
that the US banks would <i>not</i> fail;
there <i>would</i> be liquidity; the banks
<i>would</i> be well capitalized with plenty
of reserves with no doubts; there would
not be <i>runs</i> on the banks; AIG could
be $85 billion in the hole and cause
no problems, etc.<p>Bernanke was just <i>determined</i> not to be
the Fed Chair who presided over the
second Great Depression, e.g., from
banking regulation failures.<p>Marc, in the US,
we <i>regulate</i> the banks.  The US Federal
Reserve, etc. has the banks by the short
hair, holds on with a tight grip, and
just will <i>not</i> let go.  Marc, are
we learning, now?  Are we getting some
clarity about banking &quot;regulation&quot;?<p>In many ways, in <i>social and psychological
capital</i>, the US is still recovering from 
the severe damage and losses of the Great
Depression and WWII:  People that lived through 
those years,
and many didn&#x27;t, often suffered horribly
and, thus, did some relatively poor parenting,
passing on a lot of really strong anxieties
and not nearly enough in security, insight,
social, psychological, emotional, artistic,
and intellectual <i>capital</i>.  The anxieties
led to stresses led to depression, incapacitation,
more stresses, more depression, clinical depression,
a huge range of social problems, including
some suicides.  I know far too much about what
I am describing.  We&#x27;re talking big deficits in
social and psychological <i>capital</i> passed from
parents to children.  We have not recovered yet.
It appears that full
recovery will take a few more generations.
E.g., I can believe that a tribe in Brazil
that never saw <i>civilized</i> people is generally
much happier than people in the <i>civilized</i>
countries that went through the Great Depression
and WWII.  Those tribes have no banks, bubbles,
and Great Depressions.<p>The Great Recession?  Still a <i>lot</i> of people are
not yet back to work, and that situation is
well known to lead to more in abused wives,
abused children, alcoholism, drug abuse,
crime, infant mortality, divorce,
and suicides, <i>little</i> results like those.
Marc, you can understand wrecked families,
right?<p>It seems that banking regulation is just 
crucial unless, of course, we want to kill tens of
millions of people a few times each
century.  Ah, let&#x27;s don&#x27;t just mince words,
kill a few hundreds of millions of people
a few times each century?  More?  Sure, maybe
more!  Right, Marc?<p>Sure, I know; I know; we can agree that the dangers
of unregulated banks won&#x27;t last very long.
I mean, that is, don&#x27;t you see, another
WW will mean we no longer need any more
banking regulations, or coal, natural gas,
oil, cars, houses, plastics, trash pickup, clothes, schools, hospitals, restaurants, smart phones,
libraries, the Internet, venture capital firms,
venture partners, or people -- there won&#x27;t
be anymore people, puppy dogs, kitty cats,
birds, etc.<p>Gee, &quot;Look, Ma, no more banking
regulations!  Ma?  Ma?  Are you there, Ma?
Ma, where are you?  Ma!!!!&quot;<p>Thank you Marc.  Your <i>knowledge</i> of finance,
banking, and economics is showing through
with great clarity!!!!!!<p>Gee, I thought that we were all supposed to
understand financial bubbles, the Great Depression,
etc. by, what, somewhere in middle school?
Marc, did you skip middle school?  Maybe
you&#x27;d want to go back, sit in the front row,
and pay attention?  And put away your
mobile devices.<p>Unregulated banking?  I&#x27;d rather give chunks
of plutonium to naughty 8 year old boys just
to see what they could do with it.<p>Marc, unregulated banking is 
the fast way to the end of at least
human life on earth.  Wouldn&#x27;t
be very good for your deal flow or
venture returns
either!<p>Sorry to be so negative:  50 million, maybe
100 million, dead, the suffering of my
ancestors and my wife&#x27;s ancestors who
went through the Great Depression and WWII
and the Cold War tend to make me a little,
just a <i>little</i>, shall we say <i>sensitive</i> on this subject.
But, I&#x27;d rather be sensitive and negative
than silent and dead.  Right, it&#x27;s just
my opinion, and YMMV.  </rant>",1413659001

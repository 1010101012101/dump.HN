All new developments have to be sidewalk enterable, by what I read for a couple of reasons, both promoting walking and use of public transit, and (for what's a major problem around here) providing access for pedestrians that doesn't require walking through parking lots. It's quite surprising how many injuries there are in parking lots due to driver fault (pedestrians have de jure right of way in parking lots).<p>Also I've noticed many other new builds in the area are conforming to the regulation despite being outside its area of effect.",1267880055

But it's a worthwhile ""loss"".<p><i>They're just clickwrap EULAs, since you can't enforce the restrictions they add on top of the GPLv2 via copyright law.</i><p>Sure you can.  Under copyright law, you can't distribute copyrighted code without permission.  You also can't distribute derived works; binaries produced by your compiler.  The GPLv3 grants everyone permission to copy, compile, and redistribute, as long as they give others the same permission, promise not to sue the people they give the code to, and promise not to ship the code on hardware that can't run modified versions of the code.  That fits perfectly into the framework of copyright law.  If you don't like the conditions of the GPLv3, you fall back to copyright law -- you can't distribute binaries or modified versions at all.<p>EULAs rely on a much shadier principle; that you ""redistribute"" a copyrighted work when you copy it from your disk into memory.  Copyright law says, the lawyers reckon, that you can't make that copy unless you are given permission.  You are given permission by following the EULA.<p>You can see that this is not quite the same as the GPL because of the scope.  EULAs say copying is how your computer runs programs.  The GPL says copying is making a copy for your friend.  Much more solid.<p>Anyway, if you don't like software licenses, don't use one.  I like the GPL, though, because I want people to give me back what I gave them.  Nice people will do that anyway, but not everyone is nice.  So the GPL clearly spells out their obligations to me, and lets them make an informed decision as to whether or not they want to modify and redistribute my software.  The nice people follow the rules anyway, so the GPL makes no difference to them.<p>Are you a nice person?",1267879396
1171459,comment,1169875,1171098,0,0,cheald,,,"World of Warcraft. MMORPGs were very squarely the domain of the archtypical basement-dwelling nerd - they were intensely mathematical (which is natural, given its D&D lineage), brutally punishing in the case of mistakes (corpse runs, XP loss), and tuned to the highly-methodical, cause-and-effect nerd mentality (""blind"" crafting lists, week-long spawn timers, etc).<p>Then WoW came along, sucked out all the ""nerd sauce"", and replaced it with an easily-accessible set of rules that made the game approachable and appealing to the mass markets, and it has been wildly successful as a result. The nerd bits are still there, buried deep down, but the average player never has to touch them to fully enjoy the game.<p>Sure, if you play WoW, you're still a ""nerd"" by social standards, because hey, let's face it, you're playing an online role playing game in your underwear with hundreds of people you've never met, but there are a lot of people who we wouldn't classify as ""nerds"" that play the game.",1267879385

V8 is fast compared to other JavaScript engines. It's very slow compared to most other languages. PLT Scheme, a non-fast Scheme platform, averages half the time of V8 in the flawed benchmarks game (single core, JavaScript cannot multithread.) Lua, a fast non-broken dynamic language with first-class functions averages between 3x and 100x as fast as V8, the fastest JavaScript engine.<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=v8&lang2=luajit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all...</a><p>By definition they are flawed benchmarks, but you will have a hard time writing faster JavaScript code than equivalent code in most other platforms.

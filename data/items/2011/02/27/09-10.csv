It puts a lot of emphasis on fundamentals, but students who focus on fundamentals (in class) are found to be able to do creative stuff with the material out of class. ""Wax on, wax off, now go kick ass"".<p>It's very anal, like I said.<p>The teachers get a DI textbook (made up by the inventor of DI). The teacher reads from the text book, and asks the whole class to respond on cue.<p>The whole class responding on cue is an important point, as it keeps the students thinking. ""Everybody, what's 12 * 8?""<p>It uses lots of repetition, and a few standardised instructions to the class.<p>""Everybody open your books, to page 23. One two three. Everybody should have their books open. Put your finger on the word ""MY"". One two three ... Now everybody read out load ...""<p>Interesting factoid - ""The Pet Goat"" (think 911, George W.

2267586,comment,2267499,2267499,0,0,wisty,,,"I think there's two sides to the story.<p>Actually, no, there's more than two sides to the story, and the idiots who think there are two sides to the story and making everything worse:<p>* Some teachers are awful, and the unions protect them. They also manipulate educational policy, both to improve teacher conditions (which is fair enough - that's their job), and to push the pet beliefs of a couple of batty union leaders.<p>* Most teaching ""methods"" (fads) suck, and are cooked up by the kind of people who get PhDs in ""education"" - ivory tower researchers who can't do, and can't teach, but can publish in a naval-gazing journal.<p>* Most ""methods"" (fads) require mounds of paperwork, so the teachers can prove they are complying.<p>* Direct Instruction (DI) was found to be the best teaching method by far, the last time they did any serious research. However, it does cramp creative teachers, and it's quite possible that more serious research will find better methods (possibly based on DI, but not as anal), but the opponents of DI don't want serious research (as their pet ""methods"" suck, compared to DI, and they know it) and DI fans think the problem is solved.<p>* Some kids are ""special needs"". Some kids are dumb. Some kids are smart. Some kids just look dumb because they aren't motivated, and some kids just look smart because they are being pushed hard, and nobody can agree what ""smart"" and ""dumb"" means. Mixed classes are good in some ways, but they can't be too big (or the teacher can't help the outlying kids). Big classes are good for the better kids, but only if they are streamed.<p>* Text books are often terrible.<p>* School work can be assessed (extrinsically motivated) or un-assessed (intrinsically motivated). Extrinsic motivation drives out intrinsic motivation, but some assessment is necessary. The current trend is to pile on more assessment (both tests and formally assessed homework) under the assumption that kids have already been jaded by the existing assessment, and no longer care about learning for learning's sake.<p>* We are spending too much, and not enough.<p>* Finally, there's rarely any end goal in mind. Or there are several end goals, and everyone forgets which ones are important. Feeding universities, creating a skilled workforce, providing opportunities for poor kids, getting good numbers in international tests, and most importantly convincing parents (voters) that something needs to be done, and we are already doing all that is humanly possible to help YOUR child beat the kid sitting next to them.",1298799840

I think it's a clever, really clear way of looking at it.<p>RE: your 2nd point: Novelr.com is about writers who are posting their fiction online, in a serialized, once/twice-a-week format, and then turning their work to ebooks for sale on the various ebook stores. That's one trend to watch out for, and I can say with confidence that there <i>is</i> a market, however inconsistent the quality may be. There are customers out there for the entrant, and they <i>are</i> biting.<p>(Plus there's also fanfiction, and sites like Fictionaut, where writers read, comment, and suggest (mostly grammatical & spelling) edits on each others' work. I've been seeing trends like this for about four years now.) It's pretty cool stuff - dynamic, engaging fiction, some good writing (see: <a href=""http://webfictionguide.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webfictionguide.com</a> - for the good ones).<p>RE: Your 3rd point: we're building Pandamian (<a href=""http://pandamian.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pandamian.com</a>), a tool that attempts to make this write-online/publish-to-ebookstores thing accessible to all writers. It's mostly a response to the community's needs - with the mantra that 'writers should not need to read a single line of code'. Our hope, at least, is that the app would allow all kinds of writers the ability to write a book online, get a community of readers around their books, and then publish to the Kindle/Kobo/Smashwords store.<p>We launched on Tuesday, and now have a small group of very vocal users.",1298799680

If RIM makes a phone/tablet that is 3x superior to the iPad and half the price, they'll still sell next to nothing.<p>Why? The answer is quite simple. Their software is shit. Their developer relations is shit. They are competing not vs hardware, but vs hardware + software.<p>They made great decisions too... lets ship the ""Curve"" model with such shit hardware and new software it was a downgrade from the previous top BB model (the one with side wheel). Old model = 3 seconds cold boot, new model = 3 minutes. The curve could not run any software that was remotely useful. It turned into a glorified email/phone device. The internet browsing sucked so bad I had no use for it. Not to mention that the hardware could barely handle the rendering.<p>So with good decisions like that, can you really expect any more out of RIM?",1298799273

75191,comment,75132,75132,0,0,shayan,,,"One question: when is facebook joining?\nMy Answer: It will have to break the walls eventually as they have mentioned it before themselves.  When I dont know but they will do it eventually. \nMaybe when developers realize they can reach a much bigger market, a lot easier and faster with Opensocial compared to facebook, and they start developing a lot more products for them.  Or maybe when Facebook creates its very own applications (their web-wide upcoming ad network is a sign of this) for OpenSocial.",1193950660

I'm trying to design a scriptable effects engine that could allow users to do things that are inefficient. This may sound like premature optimization, but I don't really see a downside to preferring implementations that tend to be fast.",1193950567

75186,comment,75126,75126,0,0,shiro,,,"Recently I did a consulting job for a project of a kind of network backbone testing suites used by one of major telcom providers in Japan.  The suite was mainly in CL, but my part was an independent, stand-alone tool and I used Scheme (Gauche).  It was a distributed, multithreaded app that opened raw sockets and sent/received fair amount of ICMP packets.  The main app was just around 1000 LOC in Scheme, though it used quite a few libraries came with Gauche.<p>Speed didn't become an issue even Gauche wasn't a native compiler (it compiles to VM), for the network driver was always the bottleneck.  Yet I did care not to cons in the inner loop.",1193950354

Just look up online for different types of company structures.<p>I have a little thing we got from Nolo press (nolo.com- the centrla cheap legal document hub), which was an original operating agreement. We have a 3-year vesting on the agreement that you can use and if he walks, he gets a small amount, but I would also build into the agreement an attachment for rights and responsibilities. We had one partner who was not performing and we had to include an addendum so that if people were not performing, bad stuff could happen. Just send me an e-mail.and I'll pass the doc over.<p>FYI, the number one thing that all CEOs regret is not getting rid of people who don't belong earlier. So make sure that this person you're hiring on is worthy.",1193950291

75183,comment,75126,75126,0,0,avibryant,,,"So, IIRC DMX runs at about 44hz if you've got a full dimmer pack (which isn't hard with moving lights since they each take a bunch of channels).  That means you get about 20ms to compute each cycle, which strikes me as pretty soft indeed if you're running on PC hardware... I wouldn't worry about performance until you see problems.<p>Eons ago, I remember building a DMX controller by ripping out the clock from a standard RS485 card and soldering in a new (8khz?) one from Radio Shack so the baud rate would be right...",1193949669

I went to a local community college for a year, transferred over to a University of California school, and doing that you get a degree that's precisely the same as the one everyone else gets, at the same time, for cheaper, with a lot less stress.<p>I didn't have to take the SATs or any of that nonsense, either.<p>The classes I benefited the most from were project-based ones where you spent a few weeks in the library, hacked like mad for a few, then wrote a report and gave a presentation.",1193948056

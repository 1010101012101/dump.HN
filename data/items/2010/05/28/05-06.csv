Yes, if you want to make sure you <i>never</i> understand the true nature of higher dimensions and instead fill your brain with psuedoscientific garbage pulled straight from the cesspool of Star Trek, then by all means, watch that video a few dozen times. If you want to <i>actually</i> understand dimensions, pick up a topology textbook and start reading. (Or read the linked article.)<p>I can not anti-recommend that video enough. This video is anti-knowledge, convincing you that you know something when you actually understand it less well after viewing than before.<p>The actual <i>truth</i> is that there is nothing special whatsoever about ""the fourth spatial dimension"" (let alone the eighth or ninth), what's special is <i>us</i>. <i>We're</i> the ones that have trouble because we live in three spatial dimensions and our visual cortex is hardwired to work very well in 3. Four, five, six, ten, a hundred, or my personal favorite ""n-dimensional"" just means that you need four, five, six, ten, a hundred, or an arbitrary number of values to determine the location of something in a space. Nothing more, nothing less. Visualizing it a challenge, but mathematically it's nothing special.",1275023158

No one is saying that Apple should be forced to take undue legal risks, but by making themselves the single gateway to the iPOS platform, Apple implicitly assumes a lot of responsibility and, yes, legal risks. If Apple doesn't want the legal risks attending to GPL violations, then they shouldn't be the gatekeeper, period.",1275022800

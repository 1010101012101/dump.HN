Treat it with chemicals.  Treat the cells innervating it with chemicals.  Make them fire with external electrodes.  Etc.  Do this multiple times, over a period of months/years, until you have dissected some local circuitry properties.  Pretty cool, if you get off on listening to neurons fire, day in and day out.<p>I think the key in science is to do something that is interesting and pleasurable in both the long and short term.    My electrophysiologist friends like it day-to-day, and also like the long term agenda of it.

You sit in meetings discussing what the code should do, often for longer than it would take to actually write it. I was in a meeting to discuss a prototype once which degenerated into an hour long discussion on the label of the 3rd text field on the screen. The bottom line is that in some big companies, the goal is to work as little as possible.

Still, we are plagued with drama but at least there's always something to do.<p>In short, just like any career there are the boring, stressful and tedious aspects.

If they're in a building that collapses, however, they blame the engineer.  I'm not sure how we convinced users that bad software was their fault, but it's not something I'm proud about.

Here's why: in both fields, you get to explore and break new grounds, but you move much faster in software development.<p>To do anything interesting self-directed work in the life-sciences, you have to get a PhD and by then, your hands are still tied down to the government because you have to write grants to NIH. Unlike programming, where you hatch a idea, Google sample code-sources, dive into a hackthon and build a prototype after one evening of intense programming. Biochemistry takes months of patience, where you micropipette and shake test-tubes, use the PCR machines. It is hard to deciper the details, you can't step-through the codes of DNA (at least yet) or trace the memory stacks of the cells that you are studying. Coming from a programming background, I was so frustrated in Biochemistry.<p>Also you should know that the life sciences is slowly being transformed into a information sciences (Bioinformatics). There's a movement in the field called System Biology, that treats the body/a cell/macromolecular as a finite automata, the DNA the source code, and the protein products it makes the output.

One of the reasons gas is getting expensive is that people in China love cars, too!<p>What could happen, though, is that cars will become a luxury item for more and more people. That's slowly happening now, as oil gets more expensive. Cars will get smaller. They'll emphasize efficiency. They will still be bought, but will be driven less and less. Perhaps there will be one car per household rather than two or three. A lot of cars will just be for show: They will <i>look</i> really fast, sitting there in their beautiful garage.<p>Eventually cars might end up where horses are today -- a few high-tech racecars, some recreational cars in upper-middle-class garages, some working cars in poor areas of Third-World countries, and a rich literary tradition -- tales of the wild Carboys and their lives on the highways of 1960s Las Vegas.

If you increase the complexity of a language, (note: I mean <i>semantic</i> complexity here, not syntactic) you increase the difficulty involved in reading it.<p>In my not-so-humble opinion, PHP works when aimed at the lower end of the semantic complexity scale. Trying to turn it into a general-purpose language for ""programming in the large"" seems a rather unfortunate use of energy, given (as you pointed out) its obvious success in its existing niche.",1213981352

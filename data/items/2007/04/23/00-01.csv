Thought it might be useful. <p>Will post when I've got something worth looking at (this week)<p>Planning on making it kind of an 'Ideas wanted' or 'People wanted' or 'Money wanted' site, so people can interface. Putting my money where my mouth is with some distributed karma systems as well.",1177289234
15837,comment,15684,15806,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"I think you misunderstood my comment.  The point is not the amount of work involved - there are many ""lifestyle"" businesses that are hardly any work at all.  I run an online currency exchange website that takes about 3 hours of my time / day, and <i>does</i> provide a ""nice living.""  I'm not trying to brag - trust me, it's still not fun.<p>The reason (for me, at least) that lifestyle businesses suck is because they're not focused on growth.  They're more about an immediate, positive, cash flow - the low risk  alternative.<p>Contrast that to startups, where you're building something that could potentially be very big, and positively impact a lot of lives.  Now <i>that's</i> a pretty good ""lifestyle.""",1177288502

Clarke: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""<p>It has also been said that you ""Cast Spells"" in Lisp:<p><a href=""http://www.lisperati.com/casting.html"">http://www.lisperati.com/casting.html</a><p>SICP: ""People create programs to direct \nprocesses. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.""<p>I think lack of understanding of the semantics of Ruby and Rails causes people to dismiss it as ""magic"".  Create new classes, methods ... etc at runtime is not a sign of laziness.  Not wanting to spend the time it takes to learn how metaprogramming is used in Rails is.\n",1177288366

There is no reason we can't use something similar. For example:<p>[IDEA] A web site for sharing startup ideas.<p>[STARTUP] www.shareyourstartupidea.com. Comments welcome.\n",1177286960

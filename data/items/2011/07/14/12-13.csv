Khan Academy elicits my response because SO FAR, among the online exercises I have tried there, the ""enlighten the student on a conceptual level"" hasn't happened as much as just the habit-clinching drill. As Lang wrote (as quoted in the grandparent post), ""Of course, some rote drilling is necessary. The problem is how to strike a balance.""<p>The ""mathematical form of Socratic learning where none of the steps were individually too hard but still involving enough that they forced me to think and thus develop some insight on my own"" is what I attempt to provide in my live, face-to-face mathematics classes. I'm not worried about Khan Academy reducing the market for those classes (and in fact encourage current and prospective students to try out Khan Academy) because providing that sort of instruction is very hard to automate. As your example of Silverman's book points out, it is more of an art than a settled science to decide just how many steps to show with Socratic guidance, not to mention that different learners need different steps drawn out for them.",1310648031

I think that's one thing which most sites seem to miss. If you know the bands, festivals, parties I've been to you should be able to tell me about other similar ones.

2762759,comment,2762325,2762622,9,0,nagrom,,,"I think you're a little restrictive on scifi by referencing only television. There's a lot of very new scifi published as books - television has maybe dropped away, but read something by Charles Stross, for example. I don't think that such stories would have been popular or feasible in the late 80s. Television as a whole has become much less suited to fantastic ideas or new concepts as a reflection of modern tastes - look at the lack of very good documentaries compared to the late 60s and early 70s, for example, and the proliferation of reality TV shows.<p>A lot of the tech that we have is invisible to you; it's too commonplace to be called wondrous. You casually dismiss commoditized computing resources and global connectivity...the cultural and societal developments arising from these were not expected 20 years ago.<p>We do have flying cars, I think. They're called helicopters and are too dangerous to allow everyone to have one and drive wherever they like. They cost about the same as a high-end sports car. Like a high-end sports car, most of us won't own one, you can't just park them on the street and they cost up to about $500k.<p>We have changed cities hugely! You can buy any food anywhere at anytime regardless of season due to improvements in transport and agriculture technology. Cities are a huge mixture of cultures and nationalities in a way they weren't 20 years ago due to improved communications technology. Public transport is much more reliable - if you want to go somewhere, go to the city website and type in the address; you'll be given a routemap that you can carry on your internet-enabled phone, and in many cities you can track the bus in real time. Use that phone to check where your friends are and meet up spontaneously without worrying about a place's quality, because you checked out a hundred reviews on a location-aware website. How many people could work from coffee shops 20 years ago? Buildings are safer (and smaller), and feature built-in hooks for modern tech to play with. It's not happening fast - but look at how cities 'advanced' in the previous 500 years. You have to temper your expectations, a little.<p>You say that human-level AI is far away - I say that Google can organise and index things better than I could. Mathematical theorems are solved automatically and markets are balanced by intelligences that operate on the nanosecond and picosecond time scales! It's true that a computer won't chat to you, but wouldn't you prefer to talk to a person? VR is similar - it's a societal disinclination, rather than a technological problem. (You can already make a case that augmented reality is here right now.)<p>Space programmes are being dismantled, and new ones are being put into place. I think that space exploration is healthier now than it was in the 90s. Private companies are finally looking like being able to launch spacecraft reliably. SpaceX's Dragon module is the most exciting thing to happen since before the Hubble telescope.<p>All these things are referenced and extrapolated in good, modern scifi - just not on the dying medium that is television. Be more optimistic! :-D<p>(Aside: Can one can make a case that the most popular form of scifi on TV right now is crime drama? Fancy hand-held analyzers map DNA structure and imaging technologies can reconstruct crime scenes from grainy pictures. Network traces track fugitives and the machines seem to finger the perp. automagically - this is not the case in the real world...)",1310647675

Since then I've been working at home and it has been up and down--mostly ups :)<p>Looking at my journal* (personal work journal), it went like this: Tuesday: came up with idea. Wednesday: had dinner with previous startup CEO who I remained friend with. He expressed that it was a good idea and if I wanted to learn the pain of startup for myself, I should do it. Thursday: thinking... lots of thinking--then I came to a conclusion: it must happen NOW! Told my work people and they were very supportive.  Friday: I left the company on good terms (the company told me to come back once I have my product developed, they'll be the first customer).<p>2 things I believe in: 1) you do it because you HAVE TO do it--you cannot live without it. 2) you're always about a few years late :P<p>With that being said: 1) I am married and my wife and I had some cash to sustain us for a few months so I do have a bit of a nest and health insurance is on the wife 2) My idea is very simple and I believe it can be accomplished within a short time. 3) I cannot live without doing it (living without passion is simply surviving)<p>If you truly believe in your vision, then you should have no problem laying your life down for your vision.  If you are willing to put your life on the line, then like Scar Face ""the world is yours""<p>Good luck, friend and always, fight like hell.<p>PS: *One condition the wife gave me when I quit was I have to keep a daily work journal. It's very helpful.  My recommendation for you is to keep a journal--you will read back on this as perhaps the most enlightening self reflection.  You don't have to write all thoughts, just what you did that day and the tasks will tell you what you were thinking.",1310646288

I didn't understand the article it was based on fully, but the idea seems to be covered in the following paragraph:<p><i>Time-space duality represents the analogy between diffraction and dispersion that arises from the mathematical equivalence between the equations describing the diffraction of a beam of light and the one-dimensional temporal propagation of a pulse through a dispersive medium [17,18]. Similar to a spatial lens that imparts a quadratic phase in space, a time-lens can be implemented that produces a quadratic phase shift in time [19{21]. This time-lens can, for example, magnify [22] or compress [23] signals in time and has an equivalent of the lens law. Time-lenses can be created with an electro-optic modulator [18] or via a parametric nonlinear optical process such as four-wave mixing (FWM) with a chirped pump wave [19,20]. In the latter case the signal wave is converted to an idler wave with a linear frequency shift in time (i.e., a quadratic phase in time) [21,22].</i><p>I understand this to mean that the passage of time in observed space can be slowed down relative to an observer, rather as happens when observing a body falling into a black hole.",1310645869

I am surprised that so many people need this spelled out, but I suspect that many of you making this identical point live in a bubble, far from the world of traditional commercial software development.<p>Many conventional software business models are unsustainable if you give away source code. Yes, there are always exceptions (where, typically, you have some closely related bit of software or IP you can charge for - think Pathscale with their libraries or Snort with their ruleset), and you can slave away chasing your product around with services until the End of Time.<p>However, there are a couple things you just plain can't do with open source - one is to prevent people from making builds of your software for free, and the other is to prevent your competitors from free-riding on your research efforts and duplicating your hard work for a much lower cost than it took you to create it. The only way you can prevent the latter strategy is to patent the living shit out of everything, which I also find objectionable. I don't like the idea of trying to prevent someone who independently invents the same idea after me from competing with me. This sounds like honest competition. He or she got the idea by thinking hard about it - not by looking at my code.<p>Another horrible weakness of F/OSS business models is that, in many areas, there are ridiculous mazes of interlocking patents, often covering many versions of the same thing. Putting your source code out there is like sticking your head into the patent troll's mouth and begging to be bitten.<p>""Charge as much as they wish or can"" is fine up to a point, but you just plain can't, and any attempt to create a situation where you can charge more for the fruits of your labor than these crippled business models allow is treated as immoral.<p>An invented 'right to tinker' somehow trumps my (equally arbitrary and invented, in some senses) right to be paid exclusively for innovations that took a huge amount of work to come up with until such time as I choose to release them or someone else figures it out - or something better - too.<p>The (closed source) company I work for is full of grown-ups, our customers are fairly grown-up too :-) and if we are so benighted as to enter into a mutual contract where we get paid and no-one gets to see the source, it's None of Richard Stallman's Fucking Business, or yours.<p>I'm not taking away a freedom of his because I never would have invented a goddamn thing if I had to build things under the very limited range of business models possible in the world of F/OSS (note: I'm not hating on those models, just pointing out that they are not appropriate for every type of software).",1310645620

2762661,comment,2762328,2762328,3,0,danialtz,,,"Very interesting read. I have both submitted and reviewed several papers and grants. My impression is that peer-review is not as bad (as democracy example of the author), only when done with patience and passion. The barriers it creates are really troublesome.<p>I am doing a line of research in a very conservative community. You will be surprised how easily my work gets rejected from the journals, because they don't have the capacity, view and vision for such work. The grant scene is even much more devastating. Other groups don't want to let you in. You don't know who reviewed your grant; the reasons given are not major, but yet you are rejected. So, you end up wasting lots of research time looking for fundings. Quite boring.<p>Open journals are an alternative, of course. Yet, they need to be studies if they are an effective method of publishing. Then, the question is how to trust the results, and deal with many contradictory results. However, it seems it is time to tackle them than to worry though. My last publication goes to an open journal.<p>edit: typos",1310645589

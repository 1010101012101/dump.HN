Aloha is not pretty, but it's really fast. I don't want to scroll, or click into menus and tabs to then go find an order.  Just put my tables in front of me as soon as I'm logged in.<p>Trying to give constructive criticism here, so please don't take this the wrong way.  Speed is everything.  I almost feel like I can login to Aloha (all I have to do is type my server #), and then enter in an order for a table before I've even finished finding my name and typing in the password into your ""server selection dial"".  Passwords are really not that important at the server level. What I am going to do, go change someone else's check?<p>Speed.  Think raw speed.  How FEW clicks can I get from login to item entry.  It's not about how logically organized it is.  I don't want a magical experience, I want a flawless and fast experience, so that I can get back to the 500 things I have to do to service my customers.<p>My 2 cents.",1304359139

There was a similar indecent at an army base (fort hood), but the random nature of the targets and the length of time between attacks was far more threatening to people.<p>I could see a changed ""Manhattan skyline"" as a significant impact for many people.  For a while I could see the section of the pentagon hit by the airplane outside my window, but there is little lasting visible impact on the structure.  Internally, they did a fair amount of renovation for example added some glow strips on the floor pointing to the exits which seems like a good idea, and gas makes which seems less useful (and more creepy). You can even go on tours of the pentagon which seems risky, but I suspect the benefits outweighs the risks.<p>However, that's all fairly long term effects. As to being up close and personal, a coworker of mine was in a conference room when 1/2 the people at the table where taken yet he had no problem going back to work at the pentagon.

You'll want to work through a higher level textbook of QM after that; Sakurai and Shankar are two popular ones.<p>From there, you'd have a good basis to study some particle physics. The two introductory texts are either Halzen and Marten or Griffiths (same author, different book). Either of those will give you a pretty solid understanding of particle physics, including QED. You could supplement that by studying some Quantum Field Theory (QFT). At the moment, Peskin and Schroeder is the classic text.<p>Depending on your interests, you could continue in QFT with P&S. That text probably covers at least 3 terms of graduate QFT. You could also study GR. Carroll is the most popular text at the moment, but I like Schutz and others swear by Wald. If you're interested in experimental stuff, you could learn about detectors using the text by Green.",1304358338

There are maybe two somewhat-douchey but bearable guys and one prof who's always saying weird, stereotypical things about women during lectures, but mostly the guys just want to talk shop. Between 2nd and 3rd year I switched from wearing mostly jeans & sneakers to wearing mostly skirts & dresses & pretty flats and the way I was treated didn't change noticeably. The most atmospheric douchiness was during 1st year. For several months there was a man sexually assaulting dozens of women on and around campus, and I remember some idiots who kept talking about how it was sooo sexist that female students were being offered free rape whistles and self-defense classes as a result, and how the guy just had needs so you couldn't blame him, and how rape was just so much fun. It wasn't straight-up harassment, I guess, because they weren't talking to me, but being alone with them late at night in the computer labs made me feel very unsafe. It was a frequent and rather unavoidable occurrence and I can see how a woman considering CS as one of multiple possible majors would have been seriously put off. I was pretty put off and CS was the only major I'd even considered since I was 13; that year I worried a lot about what I would do if the guys in the working world were like that, too. (Never saw them in the second year labs, guess they spent too much time chatting and not enough time doing their homework, haha.)<p>Even with a decent school environment it's nice to have some female profs around as role models. I have male role models too, of course, but it's so awesome to get to see hard proof that hey, that awesome woman I want to grow up to be is not only attainable but standing RIGHT THERE in front of the classroom. Two in particular seem so fulfilled, well-rounded, and passionate about their fields that it makes me know that I made the right choice. I think if all my lecturers were male, or if the few female profs I had were the grudgingly-teach-from-the-textbook variety (of which I've had in both genders), I would feel a lot less secure. I could honestly see my alternate-universe self switching over to math or econ if the comp sci department at alternate-universe uni was as bad as the school you're talking about. Comp sci is great but it's not worth crushing your soul for, especially when there are so many other fields these days where good programming skills can give you an edge.",1304358080

The high-end supercomputer simulations and regressions cosmologists employ have good predictive power, even though we lack a full explanation for the phenomena we can observe.

You're absolutely right that sports and arts programs provide outlets auxiliary to a standard education, but for students with no interest in traditional learning, maybe it would be better to focus on those things they do enjoy and leave off those that they won't engage in.

The worst work situations I've seen or been involved with had a weak anchor team.  There's an expression that ""'A' players hire 'A' players and 'B' players hire 'C' players"" and that's definitely true in small organizations.  For larger organizations and the reason I think the anchor team is so crucial is that an 'A' anchor team can make 'B' players play like 'A-' players and 'C' players play like 'B' players.  The infrastructure, thinking and processes put in place by 'A' players can make other less capable players much more comfortable and productive.  Make sure your team is supportive of all members and everyone will be better as they play up to the high quality of the other members (when playing sports, I always play better when playing against people who're better than I am).<p>That said, it's certainly a matter of focusing the anchor team on putting in place excellent practices.  Huge problems can still occur if you have a great anchor team but they focus only on solving their own particular problem.  You wind up with the best authentication system ever and a broken payment system or with the most incredible sales pipeline ever and technology that doesn't match what was sold.<p>Clearly, ""hire only the best"" is impossible for every company and business model.

This is consistent and fair.<p>If the business (as an entity separate from the owner) decides to pay a dividend  then whoever gets the dividend pays a tax on the money.  Suppose the business decides to give me a dividend of $20,000 and I have nothing to do with the business.  Shouldn't I pay tax on it?  There shouldn't be a distinction on who gets their dividends taxed.  A dividend is a dividend.<p>If the owner wanted $120,000 in salary then the owner should have paid herself $120,000.  If she decides to give me a $20,000 dividend then I should pay tax on that dividend.  If she decides to give herself a dividend then I she should pay a tax on that dividend.  A dividend to herself is no more worthy of a tax break than a dividend to me.<p>In the interest of consistency (fairness) the guiding principle is that an entity pay tax on money it gets after expenses.  It also makes things easier.",1304355710

2506936,comment,2505875,2506817,1,0,yummyfajitas,,,"You are conflating salaries and dividends. The business doesn't pay tax on $100k salary (it's an expense) and the owner pays ordinary income tax on that. The same is true for pass-through corporations, which make up a large fraction of the profitable corporations that pay no taxes.<p>The business does pay tax on profits and spends <i>after tax</i> dollars distributing dividends to shareholders. Similarly, <i>after tax</i> dollars contribute to a corporate valuation which enables owners to sell shares and take capital gains.<p><i>A corporation is a person in the U.S.</i><p>The term ""person"" has been overloaded and you are conflating different uses of the term. A corporation is a legal person, which means they can enter contracts, file lawsuits and be sued. This provides a common interface for counterparties, nothing more.<p>A corporation is a set of assets, liabilities, a web of contracts governing the management of said assets/liabilities and a government guarantee of limited liability. I can't see how it makes sense to discuss whether something is unfair to my company. Similarly, it makes no sense discussing whether something is unfair to my cell phone and service contract.<p><i>I disagree that it is unfair to a stock holder to pay taxes on the dividends received or on the capital gains.</i><p>Me too.<p>All I said is that it's unfair to tax profits to the tune of $20k, dividends to the tune of $15k, and then pretend the owner of the corporation is only paying $15k in taxes.<p>If you want to discuss the taxes paid by the top 400 taxpayers in the US, include the corporate taxes paid by the companies they own.",1304355676

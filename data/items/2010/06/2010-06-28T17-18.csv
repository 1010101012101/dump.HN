Programmers work with computers and data which know no schedule. A tremendous number of them are traditionally nocturnal, and do their best work in the wee hours of the night.<p>If he's just lazy (as in, not getting things done) then there's a problem. But, your post doesn't seem to indicate that he is - just that he doesn't show up on <i>your</i> schedule.<p>At a previous job of mine, developers particularly were given flexibility in their scheduling. At one point, the management were looking to lock this down for many of the same reasons that you were - they had the perception that business only happens between 9 AM and 5 PM, and expected that if developers weren't making things happen in that timeframe, there was a problem. One of my colleagues told the manager in charge of the change ""I'll show up at 8 AM if you want, but I'm not going to be productive until 11 AM anyhow. I'll clock out at 5 PM after getting 5-6 hours of work in, rather than clocking out at 8 PM and getting 8-9 hours in"". The management let her keep her schedule.<p>If your partner needs to be working with external contacts during business hours, or if he is expected to perform customer service duties and be available when people are calling the phones, that's one thing. If he's the guy writing the code, maintaining the hardware, and making stuff happen, <i>leave him be</i>. Just because his schedule doesn't coincide with your schedule doesn't make his schedule wrong. How would you react if he asked you to conform your schedule to his?<p>Something you probably don't realize is that he's likely working around the clock - not just during office hours. You get to clock out at the end of the day and go home and not worry about the job until 9 AM the next day. A technical co-founder never gets the luxury, really - we're always watching, working, monitoring, and fixing. If something breaks at 2 AM after we've been asleep for a half hour, we get up to fix it. If we're having scaling issues, we work 36 hours straight to get infrastructure optimized and stable. A technical founder's job conforms to no schedule, recognizes no business hours, and takes no holidays.<p>If you want a happy tech partner, give him leeway in his schedule insofar as it doesn't actually negatively impact the business of the business. If he's not available for collaboration, is failing in his duties, etc, he needs to change something, because he's not doing his job. If it's just ""morale"", then honestly, get over it. If you make his job about showing up and having his butt in a chair from 9 AM-5 PM, then that's what you're going to get a - a butt in a chair. Established companies can afford that.

Of course, most of the Greek alphabet has been used by convention for one thing or another, and people would find it all but impossible to change those habits.<p><i>If the people who support double pi as the true symbol they should be writing papers with a definition of double pi and truly proving to the mathematical community that pi is the wrong definition. I personally think pi</i>D is a perfectly sane way to describe pi and that thinking in 180 degrees is just as easy as in 360 degrees.*<p>I don't think many people would dispute that 2pi is a much more natural angular constant than pi, the haters are absolutely right, we're stuck with all sorts of extraneous and unnatural factors that are simple powers of 2 because of that ""mistake"".<p>But long standing convention is hard to break.  Every formula list in existence uses pi, as does every textbook, lecture, and problem set.  Every formula that people have memorized is in terms of pi, and that's not something you can alter by fiat.<p>I fear that however well-intended, this may be a losing battle.  It reminds me a bit of people complaining about the negative charge on the electron - yeah, you might be ""right"", and there are certainly some annoyances that we put up with as a result of the ""mistake"", but it's over a hundred years too late for that to matter, you're never going to get a critical mass of people to change.<p>Though I will say, at least if a new symbol is used for 2pi, it's <i>possible</i> to get a few people to change over, since using that notation is not mutually exclusive with using pi (whereas the charge of the electron is a choice that has to be made, and if you make a different one from your peers, there's going to be a lot of friction).",1277746549

""My argument is that the cause of poverty has been poverty.""<p>-- end quote --<p>Being Indian, I have spent a lot of time observing and thinking about poverty from childhood, and in recent years, doing something about it. I believe he has hit the nail on the head with his analysis of the problem, yet I completely disagree with his solution, which is negative income tax i.e direct government cash to the poor.<p>Here is where I believe he is right. Poverty is a ""phase transition"" effect: there is a point of being too-poor below which you lose all motivation to better yourself, not only because there are too many problems but also because those problems are all interlinked, so solving just one feels utterly pointless. Spend time in any very poor neighborhood and you will see this. That poverty threshold would be different for different people, and you can aggregate these thresholds for a distinctly identifiable group to come up with a ""group poverty threshold"", which itself is a function of the group's history and culture. Once you are below that threshold, poverty is very hard to escape. You can state that as ""poverty is the cause of poverty.""<p>Yet, I also completely disagree with his solution - direct cash grant from the government. To prove the absurdity of it, imagine this on a global scale. Is the solution to Indian poverty then massive transfer of resources from the rich world?<p>So what is the solution then? Here is a sketch: the trouble is there are so many interlinked problems it is not even clear where to start. It is utterly chaotic. To overcome it, first create a very small ""Zone of Order"" (one room, one household, one neighborhood, one small company, one city ... whatever) where you establish clear, orderly systems. China called this the ""Special Economic Zone"" which they modeled by taking advice from Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen.<p>Once you prove that working, scale it up. You have to bootstrap from that ""Zone of Order"", however small that is. At a personal level, it could be just one small corner of your shack or one hour a day of order, and for a country like India, it could be one city.<p>You can generalize this principle: the solution to any self-referential problem (""poverty is the cause of poverty"") is bootstrapping from a very small seed. In fact, I believe most intractable problems are self-referential.<p>On a related note, read about ""Charter Cities"" <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-politically-incorrect-guide-to-ending-poverty/8134/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-poli...</a>",1277746407

you: ""Gems assumes that the gem is available in a Gem repository. I see no practical difference.""<p>Hm, I can't figure you out. Your statement is missing the point. I don't know if you see that point and are cherry picking on purpose or if you don't know both ecosystems. I've done a lot of ruby, a lot of java, and a fair amount of clojure. I frequently run into very common java libs that are not in a maven repo. It's a common occurrence. I can't think of any significant ruby lib that isn't in a gem repo. The two situations are not equivalent.<p>""Nowhere in any post did I say that Clojure the language is as easy as Ruby.""<p>Again, this is literally correct, but I feel you've implied it. You're like the Karl Rove of comp sci. The original comment was complaining that the clojure noob experience appeared painful. You then said that the java classpath was no worse than gem_path.<p>This is both wrong (the need for class loaders is one example of why, and my highlighting of the ease of use of gems is another), but it's also clearly implying that using libs in clojure is as easy for a noob as it is in ruby land. 
You can claim that you weren't implying that, but if that's the case then your reply was meaningless. Again, this is Karl Rove style hair splitting on your part.<p>Let me be clear then.

1468558,comment,1466288,1468380,0,0,moron4hire,,,"My point is, everyone has a ""standard model"" in their head about how all programming languages work. Kind of like how the same system of DNA works in all species. We extrapolate that model based on our exposure to different languages. Being exposed to only OO languages can lead to false assumptions about the over-arching framework of language, but such is the same for strict functional, procedural, or declarative exposure. As exposure to new ideas increases, the underlying assumptions dissolve into a better understanding, and the knowledge helps inform the programmer not only on the new language but on the old languages as well.<p>For example, I started my journey into programmerdom with JavaScript. Going to C (strict C, not C++) was a major mind-f<i></i>*, and I didn't make the transition well. When I went to Java, I became much more productive. Learning the finer details of how Java tracks references and performs parameter passing, I suddenly understood C a lot better. Once I knew C better, I realized a metric ton of flaws in my JavaScript. All because greater exposure to language informed my underlying assumptions about what language means. The jump from Java to C# enhanced my understanding of event-driven programming (merely because of how C# provides syntactical features for delegates separately from the class system). I then realized I understood WIN32 events in C a lot better. A similar experience followed my forays into F# (failed attempt into functional programming, but not unproductive), back into C#, into C++, back into Java (briefly), back into JavaScript (this time with the knowledge of first-class functions), and then into Scheme (finally a successful foray into functional programming).<p>A parallel can be drawn from almost any feature in one language to another feature or application of features in another. It's the essence of Turing completeness, we can emulate any system in any other system (yes, albeit not efficiently).",1277744975

I'm running a mobile start-up and we just moved into our new offices. We started working on our spare time putting in time whenever it was available. Now, my co-founder and I are dedicated full time to the business and we've hired a couple of interns.<p>The problem however is that while I show up daily at 9 AM, my co-founder (the engineer, I'm the business guy) shows up every morning in the PM. We've had several discussions about inappropriate this is and how he's degrading office morale (mine and the intern's) by showing up so late every day. He stays late hours to try and compensate this tardiness, but it's still really poor presentation and incredibly unprofessional.<p>I have no recourse because we split the venture 50/50 (no vesting). If I want to continue on the project without him, he can block it. I've tried buying him out and he insists he's committed and will not sell under any circumstance. My only recourse is to quit and block him from taking the idea and running with it. Neither of these are admirable outcomes and I'd rather run the business as far as it can go with a lazy co-founder than end it in such an ugly fashion.<p>What I really want is a decent fucking co-founder who can show up at 9 (or 10 AM if he absolutely needs an extra hour of sleep) and be a profesional. Does any one have an idea on how to motivate him to do this?<p>Thanks,

7847076,comment,7845193,7845992,1,0,ufmace,,,"What messy about this is figuring out exactly how to define intelligence, and what it really means to be more intelligent than someone. If somebody said that an AI was more intelligent than the most intelligent human, then how would you figure out if that was true? If it was true, what exactly would this AI be able to do that the human couldn&#x27;t do?<p>How does a difference in the level of intelligence of a particular entity compare to the effective intelligence of having lots of less intelligent entities? Having lots of people means that you can apply intelligence towards a lot of tasks, but perhaps all of them together will never come up with something that a greater intelligence could come up with.<p>Thinking about it, it seems to me that you have to apply it against an actual difficult task. Take a task like &quot;build a power-producing fusion reactor&quot; that nobody knows how to do yet. Would we be able to figure out how to do that faster if there was some superior intelligence applied to it? Or does the huge number of engineering problems associated with building such a thing respond better to a large number of more ordinary intelligence?",1401904612

I wish the author had done at least a tiny bit of analysis, rather than spouting opinions based on inanities like &quot;the tide lifts all boats&quot;. In this case, the boats of the poor are slowly sinking to the level of global wages for any given job.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/united-states-balance-of-trade.png?s=ustbtot&d1=19500101&d2=20141231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/united-states-balance...</a>",1401904009

7847014,comment,7846308,7846308,2,0,araes,,,"I can honestly say that this post has revolutionized my thoughts on AI.  Primarily this is because of what I perceive as the thesis statement, which is:<p>&quot;<AI> is the construction of weighted tables (choices, data, meta relations, whatever) from large sets of <prior data> by <method>&quot;<p>This is kind of crazy, because I think it says you could make a Turing AI by using large datasets of prior life data for humans.  In essence, &quot;<my life> is the construction of weighted tables from large sets of <life experience> by <human learning>.&quot;  For example, if you had an AI that could learn through text, you could have extensive transcribed conversation logs of people and then large time-activity logs to use as your inputs.<p>If it could learn through video (IE, it could view images, understand objects, object relations, events in time, and assign will to the person behind actions / events) then you could instead just feed it huge video logs of people&#x27;s lives.  If you wanted a copy of a person, you could feed it only a single individual, and if you wanted a more general AI, then you could feed it cross sections of the population.<p>In addition, there&#x27;s a very cool meta aspect to the large dataset concept, in that it can be large datasets for when to use, or to feed data to, specialized sub-AI&#x27;s.  For example, you might have a math sub-AI that has been trained by feeding it massive sets of math problems (or perhaps it can learn math through the video life logs of a person?).  If its then being used as a part of a larger piece, then you&#x27;d want to know when to use it to solve problems, or when to feed it experience inputs for further learning.  In essence, its tables of categories for experience types, and then grown / paired sub-AI&#x27;s for those types.<p>I would wager that it is possible, right now, to create a chatbot that can pass Turing using the above by feeding it the equivalent of mass IRC chat or somesuch huge, human interaction by text dataset over a variety of topics.  This would naturally need sub-AI&#x27;s for mechanical things like grammar or parts of speech, and then possibly higher level meta-AI&#x27;s for interpreting intent, orchestrating long form thought, or planning.  In a way, its layers of AI based on level of thought abstraction.  If it were a human, the high intensity portions of sub-AI would occupy space relative to intensity within reconfigurable co-processor zones (sight:visual cortex, sight:face recognition:occipital and temporal lobes, executive functions:frontal lobes, ect...)",1401903884

I read a lot of Hacker News and I recognise your website, so I must have been to it before, but when I saw this post I thought &quot;what&#x27;s Gittip again?&quot;<p>Honestly, I can&#x27;t even figure out how to pronounce Gittip. Is it git-tip? When I try to say it that way I get tongue-tied over the double-t. Gid&#x27;ip, with a kind of southern drawl? If I was trying to tell someone about it I would say &quot;there&#x27;s this neat crowdfunding patronage type site called g-i-t-t-i-p&quot;. Or just type it into their computer/phone. That&#x27;s not where you want to be. Names are what we hang ideas on, and I can&#x27;t even hang a sound on yours.<p>Speaking of ideas, I feel like there is a fundamental disconnect between the passion and grandiosity of your mission and what I see on your front page. &quot;Sustainable crowdfunding&quot; is accurate, but uninspiring. What happened to &quot;gratitude, generosity, and love&quot;? Your blog post sounds like you&#x27;re trying to remake the world based on those principles. That&#x27;s a hell of a vision. A crazy vision. The kind of vision that either goes down in flames or inspires thousands. That&#x27;s the vision that defines what you&#x27;re doing and why your organisation exists. So why can I find literally no mention of it anywhere on your site?<p>You mentioned Patreon, so I looked them up. Front and centre on their page: &quot;Be a patron of the arts.&quot; There, in one sentence, they have described why someone would care about what they do. A patron of the arts. That&#x27;s who I could be if I sign up for Patreon. Reviving the noble tradition of patronage. Supporting artists and the arts community. Joining the cultural movement of the future. What a thing to be a part of! What am I a part of with Gittip? Sustainability? You can do so much better.<p>I suppose my point is that I believe at this point you don&#x27;t need to improve your product to grow, but rather get more people interested in your product to grow. Like a software project where everyone just writes some code and hopes it links up in the end, I think the way Gittip presents itself has been under-designed, and isn&#x27;t coherent enough to achieve its goals.",1401903752

I consider my country (Canada) to be a proud standard-bearer of our British heritage through upholding the Westminster tradition that we inherited.

The Crown is what binds us to both our past and to our brothers and sisters around the world.<p>Sure, its fundamentally also a symbol of inequality and it is the ultimate anachronism today, but the role it plays in daily life is so low that I don&#x27;t think it even matters. Do I feel strange being reigned over by an elderly German lady from across the ocean? Perhaps. But the alternative is radical and unpredictable change, and that I am not so excited about.

The backtracking happens because the \\d gets matched to the &#x27;1&#x27; and the whole thing has to be rolled back when the $ attempts match and instead finds &#x27;2&#x27; (this would happen again if there were more digits for \\d to speculatively match on). So the backtracking is not caused by the laziness or greediness of the \\D* ; we really do want to gobble up all of the non-digits.<p>On the two options generally:<p><pre><code>    /(\\d)\\D*$/\n</code></pre>\nis problematic if you have a lot of digits, while<p><pre><code>    /.*(\\d)/ \n</code></pre>\nis problematic if you have a lot of text after the last digit.

You say that this makes him like Stallman, but it also makes him like Linus.<p>Linus has made it clear that his primary goal isn&#x27;t to extract revenue, and in many ways he doesn&#x27;t care much about traditional success metrics. Instead he wants to maximize values like &quot;fun&quot;. Chad wants to maximize other values, like &quot;generosity&quot;. Is it up to us to say that&#x27;s wrong?<p>Also, Gittip has a model of self-funding. Even funding a team of people with different talents. Linux doesn&#x27;t; it&#x27;s organized around a code repo, and depends on enthusiasts and enlightened corporations to keep contributions flowing. If you&#x27;re a marketer or designer who wants to contribute to Linux, you&#x27;re going to have a lot more trouble. You only think of Linux&#x27;s model as pragmatic because it&#x27;s been around for so long, and you&#x27;ve gotten used to the deficiencies.<p>And when it comes to openness, in big open source projects like the Linux kernel, it&#x27;s considered rude to have any significant discussions off the mailing lists.

I used to work for the Wikimedia Foundation, and we did similar things, so the community could act as a watchdog. Our &quot;full disclosure agreements&quot; were difficult for partners sometimes, but they didn&#x27;t preclude alliances with Apple or Facebook, or donations from Google.<p>Now, from where I sit, Chad might have taken the openness tactic a little too far. Some discretion is appropriate, especially when people are just starting to form a relationship. And contributors need privacy. To their credit, the Gittip community is currently reconsidering some of the rules around openness, and Chad has been admirably open to that -- another way in which he&#x27;s not a Stallman.",1401901443

They think they can let exceptions fly without any try/catch or try/finally and everything will be fine, which is obviously untrue.<p>Sorry, what I meant by &quot;happens all the time&quot; is that there are often cases where you need cleanup code that gets called if the function doesn&#x27;t exit cleanly.<p>There&#x27;s very often no atomic way to perform a series of actions. Please keep in mind, I was being very vague on purpose.  There is almost always a list of actions that you want to either all succeed, or else you need to do some cleanup if later ones fail.<p>In code with exceptions, you don&#x27;t always <i>know</i> what can throw.  Unless you&#x27;re using java code that has been written with strict checked exceptions, you have to assume any external function you call can throw.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t now, it might when Bob from the next team over decides that now it should.<p>I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s at all contrived.  I&#x27;m not saying you <i>can&#x27;t</i> write this code with exceptions, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s harder than it needs to be, and it&#x27;s at least as verbose as Go, if you&#x27;re doing all the right things with your try/catch/finally&#x27;s.",1401901423

The idea is that as the Bitcoin transaction volume climbs, the need for a block reward decreases.<p>Secondly, you&#x27;re assuming that the mining pool is currently constrained by what is profitable. From what I have read about large mining operations, they are significantly into the green on profit margin right now, so there seems to be room for a decrease in profitability without losing significant portions of the mining network. Every time the mining difficulty changes this is tested already so we know that there is at least some wiggle room in the mining profit margins.",1401901409

5477621,comment,5477405,5477405,15,0,navait,,,"""Why Nerds are Unpopular"" was always my least favorite of the pg essays. The thought ""Nerds serve two masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart"" is arrogant. I don't think nerdiness implicitly makes the things you do more important or smarter. Being bullied in school is undeniably wrong and hurtful, but claiming it's evidence of your intelligence or that you're above social ""games"" is silly. Even nerds bully, and seek some form of status the essay claims nerds aren't.<p>And is it really true? It's certainly possible to be well liked and smart, and I don't think intelligence implies that you lack social skills. It's more true that certain levles of nerdiness causes a lack of social skills.",1364875164

5477618,comment,5475881,5476605,1,0,PavlovsCat,,,"I actually agree with making game-y stuff just for fun, because it allows you to think up and build rather intricate architectures real quick. It's hard to make a game as a newbie and not have it turn into spaghetti as you keep making it more complex, but it's also no biggie, and you get to learn how to recognize those things, what to improve etc. Practice with games, when you become more confident make applications; to me that makes sense? <i>Playing</i> games may be a shallow pastime, but <i>making</i> one can become more hardcore than one imagined real quickly. Just about anything in programming you could mention, certainly all the ""pedestrian"" things, could theoretically be put in a game - but a game can also be just two rectangles and one circle, and in that spectrum, and the absence of even the pretense of being useful, lies a great opportunity for experimentation and learning.<p>Make a simple clone of a game or application or graphical effect you adore, and go from there. There's still plenty of opportunity to suck the fun out of it later :P",1364875146

I studied food science in college with bright-eyed dreams of entering food product development. Instead, I ended up a front-line supervisor at a factory and it was the most miserable experience. I knew I was good at programming and I was obsessed with it as a young kid, but it was never something that I felt was ""cool"" to study and none of my friends did anything like that.

So you need a CC and a private mailbox service in every city you want to see TV. But that is really just circumventing the must-live-in-service-area rule, so subject to being found out and cut off.<p>The limitation on transmitting copyrighted works essentially creates a geographical monopoly with respect to television. Even if you could fly to another city and watch TV for free there, it is a copyright violation for a company to send you the signal from an antenna there. That's also why the Zediva rent-a-DVD-remotely was struck down: even if you own or rent the equipment, it seems illegal for the company to transmit the copyrighted work to you.<p>The ruling in the Aereo case gets around this because they limit their transmission to people who get the exact same free-to-air signal. There is still a transmission (which is what the dissenting judge based his argument upon), but the practical effect of getting the same content you would get otherwise seems to have prevailed, fortunately.<p>IANAL so I don't know how accurate that all is, but it's the understanding I've gotten from reading around.",1364874810

I'll give this advice: Just talk to the person who is in a position to ""OK"" such a thing. Find out if there is a technical barrier. If there is, offer to assist in working through it. If there is no technical barrier, then they may just have misgivings about people working remote. If that is the case, have some things prepared to try to alleviate those concerns. I would not go in expecting (or even asking for) a switch directly to full time at home (if that is what your end goal is). That might be too big of a leap if they have any concerns at all. Perhaps propose 1 or 2 days a week for a fixed period of time (a month or something).

5477524,comment,5476293,5476668,1,0,kenko,,,"""The law, almost by definition, cannot be written to foresee all innovation. So it is a given that by definition many, if not most, innovations will fall outside laws.""<p>That very much fails to be the case. Suppose for instance we had a law that said ""no new way of doing X is legal."" That law would, in fact, foresee (not de re, but de dicto) all innovation in the realm of doing X, and it would exclude it from the law---that would actually be its intention! That might be a bad or stupid law, but that's not the point; no innovation in the realm of doing X falls outside it. You presumably mean that something falls outside the law in the sense of falling outside what's <i>legal</i>, which is very different, because something can only be <i>illegal</i> if it's <i>within</i> the scope of the law. (My choice of rye bread over whole wheat falls outside the law; the law is silent on it.<i>) It's of course also possible that something very new comes along and it's just </i>unclear* where it stands vis-a-vis the old laws, in which case, sure, the laws don't foresee that (unless some innovative (!) legal argument is brought to bear to show how the new phenomenon falls under the old laws after all).<p>* (this is actually material for support for the claim that many innovations fall outside the law, though not support that's very helpful to you. My innovations in the preparation of toast, for instance, are likely to fall outside the law, as beneath the law's notice. My innovations in murdering my enemies may also fall outside the law <i>as such</i>, that is, it may not be a legal matter that I killed them precisely <i>this</i> way.)<p>It also, of course, isn't the case that---as often seems to be assumed on HN---the innovative is the good. (Trivia: when Catullus in the first Catilinarian says that someone was a revolutionary, he describes that person as ""novis rebus studentem""---pursuing ""new things"". Not <i>every</i> revolution is a positive one.) Thus the final goal may well not be compromise, and a good thing, too. Nor is it obvious that if the final goal is compromise or something like it---and compromise, in itself, is an exceptionally stupid thing to have as a goal, just about as stupid as having novelty, in itself, as one's goal---the onus is on the government to move first. Why doesn't the company in question start by making overtures to the government, you know, making a positive first step, instead of starting off by transgressing the law? A friend's summary of Tom Slee's complaint about ber et al. seems apt: ""He's a social democrat; I suspect when he looks at these companies, he sees a bunch of venture capitalists deciding that they're going to unilaterally reshape the licensure frameworks that dozens of separate localities have democratically enacted over decades of contestation, and that seems a clear affront to a number of (legitimate) values."" If you're going to speak the language of compromise, i.e., deny that you're after a unilateral reshaping, then why do you start off with a transgression designed to accustom people to your service <i>before</i> you've cleared it with the relevant authorities?<p>Anyway, and this is really to the parent of my comment above: the government sponsors an incredible amount of innovation. The National Science Foundation, for instance, gives out a lot of money to scientists; I'm sure not all of the work is ground-breakingly transformative, but that's the nature of the beast. The NEH, the CDC, the NIH, all public universities, the NEA, lots of non-national governmental grant-making or study-sponsoring agencies---all of these things support innovation of one sort or another.<p>Whether what they support is <i>as</i> innovative and rad-i-kool as yet another unlicensed car service, I admit I don't know.",1364873158

If you were the company making Raisinettes and one year you can make them available because the market is functioning, but the next year you can't because the market collapses, you know what happens? You simple remove that product from your product offerings. It's possible that once the market returns to normal, the derivative product is no longer offered because the company making such a product doesn't want to spend time and money making the product, taking it to market and marketing it if the market may just collapse again the next year.<p>This is a serious issue for any agricultural product where there are a lot of derivative products.

5477498,comment,5476363,5476886,6,0,lsiebert,,,"Recursion isn't hard, it's just not taught correctly.  It's fairly easy to break it down into rules.<p>Because they are shown examples, instead of taught how, people memorize how to do stuff, instead of learning it from principles.<p>Take the classic question, recursively reverse a linked list.<p>You will see a lot of people making false starts, or trying to reverse the list in some way like they would reverse an array, or even repeatedly walking the list to the end.<p>But if you understand some simple rules about recursion, it's fairly easy to figure out how to do this on the fly.  And that is so much better then memorization, because you can explain why you are doing things.<p>first you are reversing, so you're moving backward, which means you calls your function, then do assignments.  If you were doing something moving forwards, like printing in order, you'd print first, then call the function.<p>Now we need to worry about the end, and the beginning.<p>First, the beginning, which happens after we have recursively walked the list.<p>Now, we want to walk to the last node before null, and we need a place to store what we return.  so assuming we have something like this in c  'node * recursivereverse(node * current)' and a node structure with next as the next link (we never touch our data)<p>our test is
if (current->next)
  node * newbeginning = recursivereverse(current->next);
else
  return current;
//some assignments go here;<p>return newbeginning;<p>Then we just need to figure out the assignments.<p>Now, people may get tripped up and try to use the new beginning... but then they have to walk it to the end... but the current node already knows the node that comes after it.<p>so we assign current->next->next = current;  IE the node that was previously after the current node now points to the current node as it's next.  
And that's fine for all the rest of the list, until we get to our original beginning node.  We need to worry about the new end.<p>Since it's going to the end, we need to point it to NULL, otherwise it will point to it's predecessor, meaning we'll have an infinite loop at the end of the last two nodes.<p>Easy way to deal with it is to just assign the next of the current node to NULL, for each node.<p>so we add to current->next->next = current;
current->next = NULL;<p>and then you have a reversed linked list.  This makes certain assumptions about the list (like it has at least one node, and isn't circular), so don't just copy this for your interview.<p>So with some simple rules, I figured out how to reverse a linked list.  But those simple rules aren't taught, or at least, I came up with them for myself after I became a computer science tutor at my college, because I needed people to understand recursion.<p>So I guess my point is, it's not that people can or can't understand recursion, it's whether they are taught to think about things in the right way.<p>Now to a certain extent, we need to teach people to generalize, but if you teach people a general rule (always worry about the beginning and end of any data structure, and that's important for everything, including memory management and debugging) and a recursion specific rule (call the function first to reverse, call the function after to use the current order), and they can generalize.<p>Too often people come to program with the ability to copy code and get it working (and that isn't anything to denigrate, because it's not simple), but lack the understanding of how to think about things in a deeper way.",1364872678

The folks who built NYC at the turn of the century had vision. They didn't just put in subway lines, they put in mostly four-track subway lines with room for express trains. They didn't just build commuter rail, they built a vast system (again with a lot of four-track to accommodate express trains) with stations in numerous little Westchester and Long Island town. Oh, and it was electrified in 1903 (kudos to Tesla, but all-electric commuting is very turn of the 20th century stuff).<p>Over 100 years later, we're still using that infrastructure. Today, of the 1.6 million people that enter Manhattan every day for work, 80% ride either commuter rail or the subway. This is a movement of people that would absolutely crush any other city despite their extensive highway networks, but New York handles it very well using ancient infrastructure.",1364872059

And if the same is the true about the next intersection, the light will be green there too; based on the sensors, the system can gauge the <i>amount</i> of traffic going towards the next intersection, and prioritize the flow. So if there are a lot of cars going towards an intersection, and a single car arrives that needs to cross their lane, the system may favour the group and prolong the green light.<p>In that sense it's synchronization, as ""adjacent"" lights will be considered by the algorithm.",1364871718

Native apps clearly have the advantage on UI --- for now --- but on UX it's a lot closer.  Part of UX is being able to sit down on my Linux desktop and not have to worry about whether I can check my calendar.  Part of UX is not having to exit out of what I'm doing to simple check the weather.  Part of it is not having to choose which computer I buy based on whether it is compatible with the document format I use.

Still, the Chinese are capable of physically blowing up a lot of American infrastructure (and vice versa), and the Chinese may be capable of disguising a physical attack as a terrorist attack.<p>Cyber-warfare is another vector allowing states to attack each other, but it's still less powerful than conventional warfare, and not that much more powerful than conventional espionage.",1308132904
2656531,comment,2656283,2656390,1,0,barrkel,,,"> I don't think languages should be privileged in regard to types.<p>C++, relatively speaking, is not ""privileged"" with regard to types, but that lack of privilege is bought with great pain, particularly in exception safety mixing with copy constructors. The lack of semantic guarantees when overriding operators - like assuring the unsuspecting library user that x += y does something similar to x = x + y - can also be a genuine problem. Java evaded the whole thing for quite justifiable reasons, IMO, and C# implements operator overloads in relatively specific ways to avoid some of these problems - and still doesn't let you have copy constructors, assignment operators, or destructors on value types.<p>By baking in certain assumptions about types into the language, the commonality across all code written in the language is increased, and the costs of documentation and communication at independently developed library boundaries is reduced. There are also other benefits; with baked-in knowledge, the language may support value literals for specific types in the lexer and parser. Doing this in a non-""privileged"" way would require macros or compiler plugins, which are themselves undesirable for a whole set of other reasons.",1308132887

You meet people in real life, then you friend them on Facebook. Not vice versa.<p>As far as I can tell, something that Color is expanding into is creating this ""temporary"" social network where you share photos with anybody within a certain location.  It isn't as much about sharing photos with friends that you already have, as it is about discovering new people and the photos they're taking around you.<p>Based on widespread privacy concerns that Facebook has had to deal with, I'd say it's unlikely that this app involves social discovery.  It's probably another friend, photo-sharing app, with the permissions of sharing mirroring what happens on the Facebook webapp.",1308132257

Algorithms are abstract concepts.<p>> e.g. they assume everything is happening at the information processing level.<p>Everything does happen at the information processing level. Any kind of physical process can be seen as a type of information processing. Information processing is not an abstract concept like an algorithm, for it to occur requires the time-evolution of concrete physical processes.<p>> We can emulate the motions and powers in play in liquids, but not &quot;wetness&quot; in the sense of the physical property (moisture etc).<p>The physical property is experienced as sensory input. Machines can have sensory input.<p>> An emulation can only water emulated flowers.<p>You are asserting that virtual reality is different from reality, which is true. That&#x27;s not the GP&#x27;s question. The question is whether there is a fundamental difference between machines in the real world (with sensors and arms and so on) and the human body and brain.",1432259922

9586287,comment,9583196,9585928,0,0,manyhats,,,"In this environment, it&#x27;s very difficult to price IPOs &quot;correctly&quot;.  I&#x27;m no longer involved in that aspect of the business, but I was in the late 90s, and the same thing happened back then.<p>Basically, in a &quot;normal&quot; market, you&#x27;d have your company A, and comparables B, C, and D.  B, C and D trade for an average of 20x earnings.  So you&#x27;d price A at the traditional 15% discount for general IPO risk (unknown issuer, etc.) and it would go to the initial investors at a 17x earnings multiple (let&#x27;s say it had earnings per share of $1), or $17.  The initial investor would have the expectation that it would trade up to $20 in the near term.<p>In the late 90s though, when nearly all tech-related IPO&#x27;ing companies didn&#x27;t make any money, most everything traded on revenue multiples.  So when your comps B, C, and D were burning cash and were expected to continue to lose money for the next few years, and traded for 8x revenues, 12x revenues and 10x revenues, well the best the traditional theory had was to say you would take the discount off the mean.<p>The problem was that traditional valuation metrics (earnings, cash flow) had no bearing on the price of the stock, so if 12x revenue for a cash-burning business was valid, why not 14x or 16x or more?  Your 10x average revenue with a 15% discount could take your IPO multiple of 8.5x to more than double that.  It was impossible to accurately predict the first-day pop, and I imagine the same is true today.<p>No one wants a &quot;failed&quot; IPO though, so everyone tends to err on the side of caution and will generally be willing to give a greater discount to ensure that the stock doesn&#x27;t break IPO price in the first month.  Especially if there&#x27;s not a traditional valuation that makes sense on the business (trailing/current profits or cash flow).<p>As hard as it is to believe, things are better these days.<p><a href=""http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/05/first-day-ipo-pops/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/05/first-day-ipo-pops/</a>",1432259091

The underwriters will sell 115 shares at $1 (the extra 15 shares are the overallotment) and the company sells the bank 100 shares and grants the bank the option (but not the obligation) to purchase another 15 shares from the company for $1.<p>One bank from the underwriting syndicate will take responsibility to stabilize the price when the issue starts trading, which means that the initial sellers might be selling to &quot;true&quot; buyers, or if there aren&#x27;t any above the IPO price, the bank.<p>If the price is above the IPO price once the stabilization period is over (30 days), and the bank hasn&#x27;t bought back those &quot;extra&quot; 15 shares (in whole or part) during the period, the bank will call the extra shares from the company for $1 to close out their initial 15 share short position from the initial IPO overallocation, and instead of raising $100, the company will have raised $100+overallotment.<p>If the IPO priced too high, the bank will quickly run through its 15 share overallotment trying the stem the stock price fall and you&#x27;ll see the price break through the IPO price.  In this case, the bank naturally will have closed out the 15 share short position, and ABC Inc. will have raised the initial $100.",1432258065

For macros, you do need to duplicate them, but people should just do that once (and Google brings up several projects in which people have already written bindings for that).<p>> People always try to cover it up with &quot;nice&quot; abstractions, but they invariably end up being leaky (e.g. with respect to threads, garbage collection, OS portability, etc.)<p>But I don&#x27;t see how Rust makes that any worse than in C.<p>> Another huge can of worms: the build system. With a plain C extension, all I need is a C compiler on the system, and I can just do &quot;python setup.py build&quot;. The situation with Windows is also quite messy -- I can&#x27;t imagine Rust making it better.<p>Yes, you do need to add Rust support to the extension&#x27;s build system. That is fair, but I think Rust&#x27;s advantages outweigh that cost :)<p>> A system composed of Python and C will necessarily have fewer layers than one composed of Python and Rust, simply because Python is written in C and its interface is defined in C.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. It&#x27;s all machine code at runtime. The pertinent question is whether Rust adds any measurable abstraction taxes at runtime (it doesn&#x27;t) and whether Rust uses the same ABI as C (it does).<p>> EDIT: I left out the BIGGEST point -- a dealbreaker. Python does NOT have an ABI. It has an API. AFAIK, that means you have to write a Rust ABI-compatible wrapper for EVERY VERSION of Python.<p>That is unfortunate, but someone could write a crate that dynamically determines which Python is in use and chooses the right functions based on that, put it on Cargo, and everyone could link against it.<p>Anyway, people are already writing Python programs that call into Rust via ctypes and whatnot, so this hasn&#x27;t stopped people yet.<p>>  So if you just want to speed up an existing Python program, I would still recommend using a simple C or C++ extension. This solves both single-threaded speed issues and give you parallelism with multiple cores, so you will get huge speedups.<p>At the cost of memory safety, which is a big deal. And you have to learn C, which for a dynamic language programmer can be a lot harder than learning Rust.<p>Since you mentioned multicore, I should mention that the threading facilities available &quot;out of the box&quot; in C and C++ are much harder to use than the equivalent ones available in Rust, and if you reach for something like TBB and Boost now you have all the build system issues you described previously.",1432256790

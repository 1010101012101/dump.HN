171492,comment,171463,171471,0,0,mtts,,,"The fact that he's running it on IIS through FastCGI seemed to me to be a bigger problem than the fact that he's running WP as well. Not because I don't think IIS is a capable web server, but because Wordpress seems to me to be primarily oriented towards Apache + mod_php.

I just clicked through a poorly visited WP blog of mine while monitoring top and CPU never spiked above 9% use on a 3GHz <i>celeron</i>.

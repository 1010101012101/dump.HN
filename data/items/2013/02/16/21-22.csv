I mean one way of looking at it is that the more people from completely different backgrounds do things, the more interesting the work gets. E.g. it is possible that some people (teens, women) have a better perspective on solving some problems that affect them more.<p>I generally support the success of more people from varied backgrounds in tech. Mainly because it makes for a wider variance in problems that get solved. It gets tiring to see every startup out there that solves problems for 20 something people who live in San Francisco (who incidentally might be male, asian/white...).

5233160,comment,5232822,5232822,14,0,gjm11,,,"This is a nice proof showcasing an important idea, but for this particular theorem I prefer the beautiful <i>constructive</i> proof found by Liouville. It can be sketched in a few paragraphs, so let me do that.<p>0. The basic idea is to show that an algebraic number -- i.e., one that's a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients -- can't be very well approximated by rational numbers ... and then to construct a number that <i>can</i> be very well approximated by rational numbers.<p>1. Suppose you've got a polynomial <i>p</i>, of degree <i>d</i>, with integer coefficients. Let <i>x</i> be one of its roots, and let <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> be any rational number. How close can it be to <i>x</i>? Well, let's ask a slightly different question: how close can <i>p</i>(<i>a</i>/<i>b</i>) be to 0? Answer: it's always (some integer)/<i>b</i>^<i>d</i>, and unless <i>x</i> actually equals <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> that integer isn't zero, so is >=1 or <=-1; so abs(poly(rational)) >= 1/denominator^degree.<p>2. OK, so how close can <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> be to <i>x</i>? Well, roughly speaking the ratio between p(<i>a</i>/<i>b</i>)-0 (which we know isn't too small) and <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>-<i>x</i> (which is what we care about) is close to <i>p</i>'(<i>x</i>), provided <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> is close to <i>x</i>. So (after filling in the details) we find that: if <i>x</i> is a root of an integer polynomial of degree <i>d</i> then there's a constant <i>C</i> such that every rational number has abs(rational-x) >= C denominator^<i>d</i>.<p>3. Now let's construct a number that is better-approximated by rationals than that allows. Specifically, take a decimal that looks like 0.110001000... where the spacing between the 1s grows very fast. The traditional thing is to take 10^-1! + 10^-2! + 10^-3! + ... so let's do that. Then truncating after 10^-<i>k</i>! leaves an error that's approximately 10^-(<i>k</i>+1)!; in other words we have a rational number with denominator <i>N</i>=10^<i>k</i>! and an error on the order of <i>N</i>^(<i>k</i>+1), so for any integer polynomial of degree <i>d</i>, once <i>k</i> gets somewhat larger than <i>d</i> this approximation is ""too good"", so this number can't be a root of that polynomial. So it can't be the root of <i>any</i> integer polynomial; in other words, it's transcendental.",1361051360

We were looking to make few custom pieces for our apartment and found a guy, in his early 50s, who did an incredible job. I also chatted with him and he too was complaining that the client stream is dwindling.<p>His (and probably your dad's) problem is that he was still grasping at straws and willing to have the old world order back. He was longing to build custom kitchens that serve more to demonstrate his woodworking skills rather than to appeal to modern taste. He was also (erroneously) considering middle class to be his ideal clientele.<p>The solution is right there on the surface. You can't compete with IKEA, so don't. You've got unique skill and it can be applied to make <i>unique</i> pieces. For those who do <i>not</i> shop at IKEA and find the quality of ""affordable Swedish crap"" simply appalling. For people who don't really mind paying 2-5-10x the IKEA prices to get exactly what they want and in quality they want. It's the top of the market, but that's exactly where the demand for high-quality custom work is prevalent.<p>Also, the focus should really be not on the intricacy of the work, but on quality. The reason being is that the taste of carpenter is not likely to be aligned with the taste of someone needing a piece for his minimalist penthouse loft. The fancier the design, the more it detracts for the quality angle. So if you are to build your dad a portfolio site, make sure to feature either simple, but casual things or something that is clearly there to demonstrate the skill and not the design.<p>... it may sound like I ramble, which I am, but it was painful to talk to our carpenter and see how helpless and lost he essentially was in modern reality. You <i>are</i> in a position to help your dad, if not with anything else but your understanding how the Internet works and how it can be used for self-promotion. Do it, dude.

The BBC does not implement any such measures. They use RTMP which is a streaming protocol now publicly published by Adobe. Sometimes they use RTMP SWF verification which has proven to be ineffective in its current BBC implementation (flvstreamer cannot handle such verification requests so the stream is dropped and is then automatically resumed). The iPhone streams are also unprotected and use plain progressive download HTTP protocol. The WMA and realaudio streams and likewise unprotected. The BBC may at some point choose to effectively protect their streams with DRM or some effective technological measure in which case get_iplayer will no longer be a useful tool for those streams. The BBC do implement DRM on their Adobe Air downloadable files and therefore get_iplayer is not useful with those. The BBC iPlayer TV only works in the UK so that they can limit the reach of their output to UK TV Licence fee payers who fund iPlayer (although legally you do not require a licence to watch non-live iPlayer output).""</i><p><a href=""http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer/html/get_iplayer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer/html/get_iplayer.html</a><p>So all the many comment in this thread about what the BBC could not do without DRM seem to be contradicted by the facts.

They are entire snapshots of the repository and a single (optional) pointer to an ancestor commit[1]. Git may handle _compression_ in terms of deltas (see 'Packfiles' in [2]), but logically, a commit should be thought of as equivalent to the state of all files that are being tracked. That difference is that if you were only looking at diffs, commits would be the _edges_ of a graph, rather than a node plus a single edge.

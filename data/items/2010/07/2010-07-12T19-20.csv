(Incidentally, you know how culture sometimes gets in the way of academic success?  In this case, a cultural background which places emphasis on hard work and scholastic achievement is a <i>tremendous</i> impediment to maximizing for what admissions officers actually care about.)<p>In the alternative, you can have your kids apply to a Japanese university, where they will be judged by their test scores without regard to their race.",1278964790
1509188,comment,1508998,1509159,0,0,jerf,,,"Few would argue diversity isn't important. It is not terribly well established that cutting along racial boundaries is the correct way to establish diversity.<p>Shouldn't we give affirmative-action style bonuses to conservatives, since they are grossly underrepresented on campus? After all, everyone ought to agree that students should be exposed to such common viewpoints; whether you think that's because student education is being limited for lack of exposure to their different viewpoints or whether you consider the ideas so transparently false that students can be safely exposed to the ideas so that they can be shown how transparently false they are, using the same racial-diversity logic says that we ought to be giving <i>huge</i> conservative bonuses for admission and tenure positions. What advantage is ""diversity"" if the result is merely a rainbow of people all identically singing the praises of the white-liberal-sourced diversity ideals?<p>The affirmative action for diversity logic does not trivially obviously cover skin color issues. It argues for ideological diversity, then slides in race as a proxy for ideology when you aren't looking. I consider the entire race-based affirmative action line of logic pretty offensively racist if you actually analyze it.<p>(I'm not arguing in favor of conservative affirmative action bonuses. Look more closely if you think I just did.)",1278964745

I didn't learn to program until my freshman year of college (and had no prior CS experience), but found that some similar-sounding software I had used for a long time had prepared me for actual programming in a surprising way (""Game Maker"", for what it's worth).  If the App Inventor ends up being anything like that, and actually useful for creating apps, it will certainly be a good reinforcement for basic programming concepts.

JinTao's job is to be a politician provide leadership and design policy that is benefitial for the country and not be an engineer.<p>2. Everyone wants to out innovate us. If you innovate you can create wealth for your country. If your country cannot innovate then you are reliant on foreign direct investment and jobs from richer countries because your country cannot generate jobs and wealth itself. Innovation allows countries to control its own destiny.<p>3. I would agree that the pool is huge and advanced. Chinese students are well discipled and they have a lot of pressure to get advanced education, do well in school and get good jobs.The pool is so large that there are millions students with advance degrees that are unemployed living in slums near technological cities waiting for their big break because there are not enough jobs for them.<p>4. America is failing in science and math is a big worry. We need to create better incentives around these fields.<p>5. China is stealing our technology and improving on existing ones. If we don't change I see a lot of middle tier engineering jobs going to India and China.<p>China is good at copying technology and selling for cheaper or improving an already existing product, but real innovation, such as creating new technologies that create whole new indsutries still will be from americans.<p>Americans, culturally, are used to thinking outside the box, critically thinking and using their imagination in applying what they learn in new and intersting ways. Chinese work force are robotic and respect authority and have a big fear of losing face or failing.<p>What i am trying to say is America will come out with real innovation and china will copy it. China will also steal a lot of the low level to mid level engineering jobs, which contributes in building our middle class.<p>The best way we can combat this is be good parents and don't let our kids be self entitled lazy biatches and have them strive for higher education on the technical side. We should also make sure we support policies that provides an evironment that allows us to be competitve to with China and India in terms of value or put pressure on chinese and indian businesses or the countries to raise social standards of its people so the american worker is competitve.",1278963184

We don't want people continuing to use IE, so it seems logical that we should make their experience ""lesser"", using CSS3 for browsers that support it and falling back to flat square boxes in IE, and that will force them to change browsers, right?<p>Unfortunately, my experience over the years has brought me to the conslusion that this assumption is incorrect. If an IE user comes to your site and it doesn't look pretty, they're less likely to switch browsers than they are to just go to your competitor's pretty site instead. It sucks, but that's the reality, and that's why almost nobody gives IE a totally degraded experience.<p>Instead, web developers use all sorts of tricks of the trade (sliding doors, complex overlapping sprites, empty divs positioned to corners, etc.) to ""fake"" the features that CSS3 gives us natively, solely because they are forced to support IE. That's what PIE was created to change.

If for whatever reason servers had to get moved, their mac address would be updated to reflect it's location. I wrote some code a while back which grabs all the mac addresses from a switch and use that to map their physical location. It's quite simple, it looks at a port to see if it has multiple mac addresses behind it, if it does, it ignores it, if not, it maps that port out and labels it appropriately. There's also a little bit of logic to figure out what kind of a device a port is (whether it's another switch, a server, a pdu, etc), which also helps with my own personal continuing de-emphasis on the physicality of computing.",1278962177

Of course there are traders driving Ferraris laughing at that.<p>Do yourself a favor:  For real data, assume mean and variance exist and are finite, but without a really careful appeal the the central limit theorem dumpster Gaussian.

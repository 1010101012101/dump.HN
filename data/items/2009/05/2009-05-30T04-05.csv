633266,comment,633120,633173,0,0,Shooter,,,"RE:  ""Well, I was never good at math either!""<p>Even more upsetting to me (as a horrible math student in K-12) was: ""Well, you'll never really use this in the real world anyway.  But you should learn it.  Now stop asking 'Why?'""<p>It is almost impossible to learn something if you have no interest in it, and it's difficult to develop an interest in something very complicated without at least a basic understanding of WHY you should be interested in it. Calculus is incredibly interesting and useful, but not to someone who is having it rammed down their throat via rote memorization without any explanation of the overarching principles or reasons for its existence.  ""Plug and chug"" was the only instructional approach my HS teachers understood.<p>In high school, I loved science but hated math.  I was actually classified as being math-phobic. I learned a bit of statistics for my science projects (Westinghouse, ISEF, etc.) because I needed it, but didn't really learn any other math until I taught myself in my 20s.  I just skipped any math that wasn't absolutely mandatory in high school, and even the mandatory classes were very poorly taught.  I basically just soaked up enough facts in my short-term memory to pass tests, but I didn't understand how anything related or why you actually did anything.  And I didn't worry about it, because not a single teacher I had could ever give me a simple example of why you needed to know any of it or what you could use it for.  When I asked what calculus was good for, for example, I was told ""passing tests.""  They said if you became a doctor or an engineer you had to know it, but otherwise you would never use it. I asked why doctors and engineers needed to know it if it was so useless, and they usually just shrugged!<p>I only became interested enough to actually learn math once I saw practical uses for it in my own life (in finance and programming, mostly.)  Self-instruction was a struggle, because I lacked any sort of basic foundation.  I almost had to start from scratch.  I still have relatively poor math skills, but I can get work done and actually enjoy doing calculations now.  A big turnaround from being completely math-phobic.  I've easily spent $5K on self-instructional math materials (which sounds ridiculous, I know, but I like video instruction and it's usually expensive.)<p>I'm angry that I avoided math and was scared of math for a decade because not one teacher I had could provide a reason to open the book beyond ""you have to learn it.""  If I hadn't developed an interest in software and finance, I would probably still be as ignorant of math as I was when I graduated high school.",1243659519

Especially with CI, I feel like I can get into a good groove and get lots done.<p>Of course, I'm probably biased: at my day job they've chosen Java for web develoment.

There's less emphasis on critical thinking, which is what I think the author of the post was trying to get at.",1243659288

I would never do that to my parents out of a sense of guilt for exploiting them that way.<p>The overall thing is that he's teaching his kids to be critical, which is a good thing for kids to learn. But it's also important to put ground rules and let the kids know that you're the one teaching them this and to lead them on that you'd be wise to their attempts at using it on you.",1243659161

It's very rare thing.<p>I'm a theist, but the way I see it, God made atheists (or made the conditions under which atheism would occur) to get a new and important perspective on things (eg God, science, society).<p>The irony of it all is this: the atheists I have met are generally devout servants of God who deny his existence. And yet I hear those of suspect motives condemn atheists!",1243657781

Having one of the largest screens also helped. I think we are just at the cusp of hardware innovation in mobiles.",1243657492

633245,comment,629707,632025,0,0,dejb,,,"> The word ""failure"" is clearly an antonym of ""successful,"" but that isn't the word I used.<p>True but in the context of the full thread, I was talking about the original poster's prediction of Android becoming Windows which would be their 'demise'. Talking about the demise of a product is clearly more on the success/failure axis.<p>> The most successful products often compromise some functionality to achieve marketplace success.<p>I'd say every product compromises some functionality in order to provide other functionality. The more successful products reach a balance of functionality that suits a larger portion of the marketplace.<p>> That doesn't make the more successful and less functional products better or worse in some abstract sense of ""goodness,"" but it does mean they don't work as well.<p>I'd say your 'work as well' and 'abstract sense of ""goodness""' are pretty much the same thing. They are both subjective measures in this context.<p>You can often get groups of people who will agree strongly on subjective areas. For example people who think that Jazz music is 'better' than Rock music. Sometimes their subjective views can become extremely self re-enforcing and harden to the extent that they see them as axioms that can be used for proofs in arguments. That's what I believe I saw happening here with the original poster. When someone demonstrates this sort of extreme devotion to a viewpoint it isn't surprising that someone would use the term 'fanboy' to describe them.",1243656977

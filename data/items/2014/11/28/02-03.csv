(Google is your friend here.)<p>One of the biggest barriers to learning about reverse engineering is fear of the expense of breaking the system you are working on.  Being afraid of breakage makes one&#x27;s exploration timid.  In buying a system specifically for the purpose, you&#x27;ve removed the major barrier.<p>Pulling something apart and figuring out how it works has to be <i>the</i> best way to learn about engineering.  Every child (and curious adult) should do it, with children having the advantage of all the time in the world to do things.  As you pull lots of things apart, you begin to learn about the full spectrum of current engineering techniques, eventually ending up with the knowledge to design your own stuff.<p>It would be cool if there was a &quot;Wikipedia&quot; of reverse engineering, whereby every consumer item out there has a web of articles, and an army of the curious has fun by stripping devices down and collaboratively documenting innards to the lowest level possible.  It would be extra cool if the community extended to a means of obtaining broken reverse engineering targets, that would otherwise be thrown away, or a way of spreading the cost of purchasing sacrificial devices.<p>Such an effort would directly feed into Free Software efforts, by providing the knowledge required to rewrite replacement software, from scratch, for the devices in our lives. (For example, Free Software for your phone&#x27;s modem processor, your washing machine, your fridge, your TV, ...?)

I capitalized on the growth and bootstrapped a startup off of the revenue coming in. Times were good and our best year we did nearly $2 million in revenue (with well over a million in profit).<p>Well, now it&#x27;s been several years and things have cooled off. We&#x27;re running right around break-even (depending on the month). Part of this is due to the market we&#x27;re in, part due to poor decisions on my part (not successfully transitioning our IP to mobile), and part because I&#x27;m not really passionate about gaming. I started the company on accident and didn&#x27;t plan to be doing it after so many years. Personally, I&#x27;m ready to move on to something else.<p>But herein lies the problem. We have users (hovering a bit below 3000 paying subscribers to our monthly membership). And we have a team (3 full-time, 5 part-time contractors).<p>So, the obvious solution is to sell the company. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been trying to do quietly for the past 6 months or so. I got an investment bank to shop us around to our competitors. Nobody&#x27;s biting. We&#x27;re too small in this industry to be attractive to the logical acquirers (who are mostly multi-billion dollar public companies).

It is impossible.  However, type systems heavily steeped in type <i>theory</i> get around it being impossible by cheating.  For example ...<p>Consider the halting problem.  It&#x27;s pretty common knowledge that given a program and some input there&#x27;s no general algorithm that tells you if that program halts when the programming language is turing complete.  However, we know that every simply typed lambda calculus program halts if it passes the type checker, so did we defeat the halting problem?  No we cheated because simply typed lambda calculus isn&#x27;t turing complete.<p>The problem with type theory is that sometimes it excludes good programs that we want to run just because we don&#x27;t know how to prove that the program is good (or maybe it&#x27;s even unprovable).

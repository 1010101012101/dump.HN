Nothing.<p>And the actual point that you keep evading -- what stops other parties from approving of ideas and speech that you disapprove of, and vice versa? Nothing. What stops them from oppressing you, the way you want to oppress others, in a way that enforces this diametrically opposed configuration of approval and disapproval? Nothing.

8089479,comment,8089097,8089307,9,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, the thing is that &quot;dark matter&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to all be super-exotic unknown particles. It&#x27;s just that the behavior we see in the universe suggests that galaxies, clusters of galaxies, clusters of clusters, etc. contain more matter than we are able to detect, since if they contained only the matter visible to us their gravitational behavior would be different.<p>Of course, quite a bit of it might turn out to <i>be</i> exotic new types of particles, but that&#x27;s a question for theory and experiment.<p>The precedent here is quite strong, incidentally, on a few counts.<p>We have high confidence in our understanding of gravity on the macro scale, and that understanding has survived some crises. For example, the orbit of the planet Uranus, as originally calculated, was &quot;wrong&quot; -- it did not appear to be conforming to the understood behavior of gravity. One theory which was developed to explain this, and which could at the time have been criticized in the style of your comment, was that there must be another planet further out, whose gravity was perturbing Uranus&#x27; orbit. Calculating backwards from Uranus&#x27; behavior, this theory predicted the location in the sky of the additional planet... which was then promptly observed via telescope (this was the discovery of Neptune).<p>Similarly, we have high confidence that weakly-interacting particles -- undiscovered variants of which are a popular candidate for examples of dark matter -- exist. The neutrino is the classic example: a particle which was posited by theory as &quot;this is the only thing that makes sense given what we see&quot;, but which would necessarily be incredibly difficult to detect on account of barely if ever interacting with anything (and thus, again, would be open to your criticism). Of course, the neutrino was eventually detected and its existence confirmed.<p>So there is nothing wrong or arbitrary or unusual, in terms of the history of physics, in positing something like dark matter.",1406374322

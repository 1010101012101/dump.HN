Of course larger market does not automatically mean more risk. But if it does, I prefer the smaller market.<p>Rephrase your question:<p>1. How much money do I need in short-term to not die as a start-up? Or do I?(may be not, if you are well funded).<p>2. What are the paths to getting the $ along with the <i>seeming</i> risks? You can cold-call or buy some clicks for each market and see which one is an easier sell/less risky and vice-versa.<p>tl;dr: if you are bootstrapping, go after whatever market is <i>most quickly</i> to get you your min $ you need to survive. maximize profit later with new products/bigger markets.",1286954526

But again, it depends on what your product is; if its something they absolutely need, then this obviously isn't a factor. Also a factor is how much work you need to put in as another poster mentioned. If its not that much work, it could be worth it.<p>A friend sells SEO software subscriptions for $50-$100/month, making about a million a year.

The crux of the fallacy is misapprehending the results of productive increase, thus mistaking a Good Thing for a Bad Thing.  That's not what's going on in the article (unless you have a very different perspective on intergenerational debt).<p>Now it is certainly true that we'll be in less trouble if the economy grows faster than the hole being dug, <i>but a hole is still being dug</i>. If things improve it would be in spite of, not because of, the indebtedness being incurred.  Again, the luddite fallacy is not applicable.<p>It is also certainly true (and proven over the centuries) that investment of capital accumulated through deferred consumption can, when applied toward improvements in technology, yield productivity gains, thereby improving the balance sheet of the inventor and the living standards of the common man.  Such gains will emerge from the market, revealing what works and what doesn't, and in not working will free that capital to be put to more productive ends.

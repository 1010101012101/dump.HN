First, the usage of fact is not regulated by SI or something, it has a number of definitions and connotations. Second, stating that all facts must be stated with tautological and temporal boundaries is beyond pedantic.<p>""I have two legs at this moment of Planck time, and not before they were formed in the womb and not after any possible incident in the future where I lose one or more legs.""<p>No. If you measure something, those measurements can change. Yes, the new measurements do not overwrite the existence of the old, that's generally understood. If your measurements change, you change clothes.

No turn by turn directions. No front-facing camera.""<p>Honestly I think Windows Phone 7 was a case of blatantly copying Apple. It came out at the end of the iPhone 3GS' life which had exactly ""No multitasking despite all competitors having it, no application fast resume"" and ""No front-facing camera"". Windows Phone 7 even threw away the ability to sideload apps which was a staple of Windows Mobile in favor of an app store only approach.<p>I think Microsoft made the mistake of thinking that they could pull off what Apple did with iOS, which is silly as Apple spent years building this unique position through the iPod. 
As a sort-of new entrant, Microsoft can't afford to start off with something that isn't ahead of the competition by a significant margin, no company in the mobile space other than Apple or Google can do this right now.<p>There also seems to be a lack in ubiquity across their products and platforms.<p>I remember when they had Windows Live Mesh, Windows Live SkyDrive and Windows Live Sync only to later merge them all into SkyDrive, then they had Silverlight for Windows, Mac and Moonlight for Linux along with Windows Phone 7's flavor of Silverlight and the XBox 360s flavor of Silverlight (used in ads) only later to can everything and now Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and the XBox One all run the new Windows Runtime but don't have the same app store nor can they run the same apps for no apparent reason.",1370012287

5798954,comment,5794867,5796005,1,0,will_brown,,,">I'd be very interested in a citation to the supposed prohibition on patients purchasing medical care directly.<p>This is the whole idea of the penalty/tax.  If a patient does not purchase insurance, and for example needs to go to the ER, then that patient will receive the penalty/tax from the IRS for not having a gov. approved health insurance plan and they will receive a bill for the actual government healthcare plan (premium payments and co-pays).  The same will be true of walk-in clinics, or offices with membership plans - they will be required to report the uninsured, so the effect will be deterring the uninsured from availing themselves to affordable care, because it will no longer be affordable but any care will result in the government penalty and the actual bill (premium) for the government healthcare plan.<p>If you are sincere here is the a cite to the Supreme Court Case: <a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf</a>  (See page 7-8 regarding the individual mandate and IRS ""penalty"") here is an excerpt:<p>""Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the mandate must make a [s]hared responsibility payment to the Federal Government. 5000A(b)(1). That payment,which the Act describes as a penalty, is calculated as a percentage of household income, subject to a floor based on a specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the average annual premium the individual would have to pay for qualifying private health insurance. 5000A(c). In 2016, for example, the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individuals household income...""<p>Do they come out and say uninsured are bared from simply paying out of pocket for medical care? No, but they do not need to say it, because on a practical level, the only way this is enforceable is requiring medical providers to report uninsured patients and disallow them to simply pay out of pocket - in my opinion this will put an end to walk-in clinics, membership based practices, and care such as CVS minute clinics.  The one way these practices will stay around is if they get in bed with the insurance companies, but: 1. it will limit patient access to care (you can no longer choose your provider and pay out of pocket, but you will be mandated who you can see by your insurance plan) and 2. drive up the cost of care (the only reason we can offer $20/month $10-$20 copay is because the cost of billing insurance/medicare is removed from the equation).",1370012186

Finally, I also have enough exposure to Spanish as well as Hebrew to be able to put together a decent conclusion as to what a conversation might be about. Each of these languages have been learnt at different parts of my life and I would say that the only one I am still fluent in speaking is English.  My Dutch is rusty, but I can hold a conversation, though will stumble over words as I try to translate them (ironic since I used to think in Dutch and had the same issue translating what I wanted to say in to English). The interesting thing is, while I may not be fluent in speaking any of the other languages, I understand them. I can pick up on key words and can figure out what is being said. Due to the nature of languages and the etymology behind words - I can often pick up on conversations in other languages I have not learned.<p>In contrast of my multi-lingual background in the spoken form, I also try to diversify the programming languages I am familiar with. While the idea of a programming language and a spoken word language vastly differs, I still see it as just learning another language - that is the mindset I go in with. A spoken language has rules - wether they are related to phonetics, semantics or most importantly the idiosyncratic rules of gender and relationships. Programming languages have a much more defined ruleset at the core that they all share (to a certain degree) and the language itself on top of it follows many of the rules I would expect in a spoken language.<p>I don't know if there is a correlation to the exposure of languages at a young age - but in my experience it has helped me.",1370010408

5798782,comment,5797751,5797751,3,0,ionforce,,,"I've done a lot of theorycrafting regarding specialists vs generalists. If we could take a detour to the Warcraft/Final Fantasy arena...<p>Being a generalist is like being a Druid/Shammy/Paladin/Red Mage. They will never be as good as a pure Warrior or Mage, but the key here is that they can satisfy (sufficiently) both roles as one person. Let's say you're on a DPS-heavy team, you would most likely take up the role of healer. So as other posters have said, generalists are good at filling the gaps of whatever team they are on. Their role will be dictated by the voids created by their team mates.<p>Let's say you have a team of all Red Mages. Instead of having them all heal and all fight, which can be chaotic management-wise, you might choose to have one function as a healer and the other two as DPS. Treat them as a specialist team even though they are generalists underneath.<p>As with a real business that scales, I think specialization really is the only way to have truly high, spectacular output. That said, there may be a place, at small scale, where generalists shine, where context switching occurs more often. Maybe we could call them ""micro opportunities"". Let's say you have three Red Mages and no one needs healing. Great, everyone is on DPS. Let's say one round, you need to pop a heal. One mage becomes a healer, temporarily, and then switches back to DPS. Compare this with specialization. Sure your Priest/White Mage can ""DPS"" but the output is negligible. They are effectively healing full time. So, while there is no context switching in the specialization scenario, there is also missed opportunity. Again, not an opportunity of scale, but a micro opportunity.<p>Personally, I love the idea of generalists. I think it's good to have perspective on a lot of things and it breeds empathy and familiarity. I think the best would be general specialists. So not ""a Ruby guy"", ""a JS guy"", and ""an ops guy"" but maybe ""backend dev"", ""front end dev"". I know a lot of people like that so it's not a completely foreign idea.<p>See also ""T-shaped"" people from the Valve company handbook. They are people that essentially ""implement"" both specialization and generalization.",1370010321

For example lets say I signed up to hacker news I might use the email address ""ycombinator2013@mydomain.com"" - this allows me to know the source should one of these companies get hacked or sell my data on. I only use the email addresses to signup to things and NEVER use the same email twice on 2 different sites and the email address never EVER gets given to anyone. Also because it's a catchall it goes to my main email account in Winblows mail so hitting ""Reply"" makes it come from my SINGLE outbound smtp email account (i/e not from ""ycombinator2013@mydomain.com"") IF and when I ever do reply to emails.<p>As I already stated A couple of days ago I received an email to ""groupon2012email@mydomain.com"" which was odd as this is the first time it had ever happened.

In most languages 1 and 0 are interchangeable for true and false.<p>I suspect the average lay adult pulled off the street would have a hard time understanding this, let alone a child.",1370009196

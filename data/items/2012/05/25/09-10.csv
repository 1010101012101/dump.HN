4022806,comment,4022594,4022594,1,0,pilot_pirx,,,"It makes as much sense (maybe even more) as talking about a ""Code Guru"" (guru being in fact a religious teacher) or ""Code Ninja"" (or ""C++ Ninja, Database Guru or whatever combination). Language is something flowing and changing. The term ""hacker"" made it's way into everyday language, partly in the misunderstood way of something illegal, partly in the more correct way of somebody with great knowledge and creativity about something. In my view it was always part of the hacker culture to use this word to show respect towards any kind of great achievement, especially technically related, but I would even accept a great musician to be called a ""music hacker"". Movies, Comics and SciFi stories have done their own part to made it known (and in parts misunderstood)) widely and all the media hype about Nerds we have seen the last decade or so.",1337939924

4022770,comment,4021593,4022009,5,0,seertaak,,,"What's hypocritical is that Google itself engages in ""censorship"" on a colossal scale, in the name of preventing spammy results (e.g. co.cc domains, not to mention Google's dealings with China). To be clear, I personally have no problem with this (in the same way that I have no problem with them removing links to copyrighted content), but they're obviously not handing over details of the sites <i>they</i> unilaterally delist to chillingeffects.com. So there's evidence of a double-standard.<p>Furthermore, while chillingeffects.org may, nominally, not be affiliated with Google, it is also apparent to anyone paying attention that Google is waging a proxy battle against copyright holders, through large donations (e.g. 7MM grant for the Lessig and his ""remix culture"" shills at EFF) to non-profits or charities with agendas hostile to rights holders and sympathetic to their expansive view of fair use doctrines.<p>When one takes into account Google's recent spending on lobbying (in recent quarters, it is well in excess of that spent by the e.g. RIAA), and their cavalier attitude to laws that don't suit them (tax/privacy), then it becomes fair to question their motives in arguing for an ""open"" internet.<p>> As a published author, I certainly value free expression more than a few extra bucks from my book.<p>You may well be a published author, but you are primarily employee at Google. You don't need to make money of your book(s); in fact, I'm sure you're quite happy to give the book away for free, since it bolsters your credentials and allows you to claim expertise in some area, which can then be monetized through employment. But this indirect avenue isn't available to musicians and non-technical writers -- there is no ""mother Google"" that will give <i>them</i> cushy jobs with free meals and other perks.<p>> Without what I've learned from the Internet, I'd probably be flipping burgers for a living.<p>I don't know your background, I don't want to be presumptive, and I realize you're being a bit flippant, but I'm guessing that if Google took you on, then you went to some top-tier university and you already come from a solidly (upper?) middle-class family. The idea that you'd be flipping burgers is inconceivable in the worst of possible worlds.<p>Just to be clear, I have nothing against Google; I think they do great stuff. I'm a big fan of Dart language, for example, and think Google has a lot of cool tech. And I think that on balance, they're probably more a force for good than for evil. But having worked for a (morally ambiguous) company like Goldman Sachs, I know from personal experience that the initial enthusiasm at working at a new (and wildly successful) company can have an effect akin to wearing rose-tinted glasses.<p>Incidentally, are Google hiring? ;)",1337939157

4022661,comment,4019893,4020903,2,0,jkn,,,"Without FRAND, standards would be fine if they required royalty-free licensing instead, which is preferable.<p>Google/Motorola are definitely not the first to go to trial over high FRAND licensing fees (see below). The only thing remarkable with the Google/Motorola litigation against Apple and Microsoft is that it was a defensive move on being sued by Apple and Microsoft. It is true they didn't sue Motorola over FRAND patents [EDIT: or did they? see at bottom]... Not by moral virtue I think, but because their patents are far too insignificant to be required by a standard. Note that FRAND is a vague notion that doesn't say what ""fair"", ""reasonable"" and ""non-discriminatory"" should mean in practice. It leaves place for negotiations and even injuctions in case of infringement. Here's a good discussion of FRAND misconceptions:<p><a href=""http://blog.patentology.com.au/2012/02/fraught-issue-of-frand-ii-politics-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.patentology.com.au/2012/02/fraught-issue-of-fran...</a><p>Excerpt:<p><i>Why should a company be able knowingly to use a patented technology while dragging out licensing negotiations with the patentee, secure in the knowledge that the greatest power the patentee has if agreement cannot be reached is to ask a court to rule on license terms and royalty rates?</i><p>Now it's true that the fees demanded by Motorola at this stage (2.25% of the sales price) are higher than usual. But that's after Apple and Microsoft violated their obligation to contract a license for the patents, and sued Motorola over their own patents. It is also expected for a party to start with a higher asking price than what they will eventually settle on. And it is not completely out of line with other FRAND licensing fees. For example Qualcomm routinely collects over 3% of the device cost: <a href=""http://www.trefis.com/company?hm=QCOM.trefis&driver=idQCOM.0080#/QCOM/n-0014/0080"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trefis.com/company?hm=QCOM.trefis&driver=idQC...</a> (from <a href=""http://www.hoista.net/post/17365252561/google-wants-1-7-billion-from-unfair-iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hoista.net/post/17365252561/google-wants-1-7-bill...</a>)<p>Another example is Nokia who recently settled with Apple for around 4.5% of an iPhone cost: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/14/apple-nokia-patent-case"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/14/apple-nokia...</a> (this was also a case of FRAND patents, see <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/28285432/Nokia-s-Motion-to-Dismiss-Apple-s-Implausible-Claims"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/28285432/Nokia-s-Motion-to-Dismiss...</a>).<p>How does that compare to what Motorola asks for? From the Guardian article, Nokia takes <i>about 4.5% of the estimated average $264 cost price of an iPhone, which Apple sells to retailers and phone networks for an average of $660</i>. Motorola asks for 2.25% of the sales price, which corresponds to 5.6% of the device cost. Not so different from the Apple-Nokia deal.<p>EDIT: According to Motorola, Microsoft used FRAND patents to seek an injunction to block Motorola's products:<p><a href=""http://www.itpro.co.uk/639088/motorola-slams-microsoft-patent-tactics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itpro.co.uk/639088/motorola-slams-microsoft-paten...</a><p><i>And Microsofts complaint with the International Trade Commission sought injunctive relief against Motorola Mobility based on Microsofts own standards essential patents. With its recent actions, Microsoft has simply reversed its position on FRAND in order to suit its current litigation strategy.</i>",1337936661

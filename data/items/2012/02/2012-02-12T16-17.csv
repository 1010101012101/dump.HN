3582251,comment,3580156,3580499,3,0,ruggeri,,,"Hmm; no, I really disagree with this.<p>The opaque car market does tend to increase revenues for dealers, but no one has explained how it incentivizes them to provide a better product.  How could it?  Car purchasing may well be a multi-dimensional problem, and price only the most visible dimension; innovation could explain those other dimensions better (like TrueCar is doing for price).  But why should opacity remain a part of this process?  Every car may be a unique snowflake (really?), but the price should be a function not of the buyer's bargaining power, but the car options.<p>The wrong incentives are unlikely to produce the right result; we know this from ECON101, why should markets for cars be exceptional?<p>Did not like the self-promotion here.<p>Finally: this article was not nearly opinionated enough.  The article explains that the cars industry doesn't like TrueCar; but then it doesn't explain the argument against TrueCar.  This is a common journalistic mistake; I'm happy to disagree civilly, but don't sacrifice the discussion to civility.  If side X doesn't have a point, then just say so.  In a debate, I'd rather have my points demolished than politely dropped.  And readers are confused; I reread this article because I thought I had missed something...",1329065985

A typical Rails application can take about 30 seconds to load (that's any time you run a Rake task, launch a server, run unit tests, etc) and unit test runs can typically take a few minutes, often times more than 10 minutes for large applications. If you use a test server, such as Spork, the load time largely goes away for running your tests, but there's still a few seconds of startup time.

If you have some minor issue you later don't disclose on an application form, then if you do later become ill with something expensive to treat like cancer, your records are searched (held by private companies who collect this information), and your policy undergoes rescission, a form of legal annulment. A couple years ago I had some heart pains and got an EKG. It was nothing and proved to be indigestion after eating too many onions. I discussed it with the doctor and he agreed to take cash for that one and make no record of it with my name due to the risk of later being denied health care should I ever actually have heart disease for not reporting a possible preexisting condition.<p>Of course all this is only possible because of the work we engineers do for the powers that exist for profit and work the angles to make sure their systems don't provide health care and deny honest people the ability to work for law enforcement.",1329065350

I was an editor in a few earlier workplaces, so I'm interested in the challenge of how to manage a mostly-volunteer, world-facing general encyclopedia project. Wikipedia sets an amazingly high standard for a project that started out so haphazardly, but here on HN and elsewhere I've seen criticisms of Wikipedia that get me thinking about how to do a similar project better. Of course, different readers define ""better"" in different ways, and the first challenge would be figuring out what intentional differences from Wikipedia would help a competing project be successful over the long term. The reason I would do this is to enjoy the result of thousands of new, well written articles on a variety of subjects, a resource my children and grandchildren and people all over the world could use for decades to come.

I've purchased a car this way and the dealers that responded were mostly ""fleet"" dealers. I took this to mean that they didn't really deal with a lot of walk-in traffic and most of their sales was to businesses. Both sides save a lot of time this way. If you wanted to go further, you could take the price you get back from the service and call around to dealerships to see if they'll go lower but, for me, it didn't seem to get better unless the model was in particularly short supply.<p>I really don't see much fundamental disruption going on here, with the exception of maybe establishing this process in some states vs others with more limiting legislature, and possibly the amount of volume that goes the traditional way vs dealer competitive bids.",1329064699

""This will only take me 1 minute"" fixes turn into half-hours and ruin the whole schedule.<p>One thing that might be worth trying is to just stop working whenever your time chunk is done, regardless of what's left. I remember reading an article here on how Hemingway used to stop writing in the middle of a sentence at the end of a creative writing session. The author was suggesting that programmers do the same thing (leaving a half completed function or even line of code, even if it means that the project isn't building).<p>I tried it after reading the article and I was very surprised with the results. I find it much easier to start in the morning when I have a half completed line of code in front of me. The context comes back almost instantaneously and even when it only takes me a minute to finish what I had started the day before, I feel like I am already in the flow and I will be much quicker when I start the next task. When the first task on my list is to start a feature for example, I often end up browsing the code files aimlessly trying to find the starting point, etc.<p>Ever since I started using this technique, I find it much easier to just stop at the end of an allocated time chunk. It's only a question a perception obviously, but instead of feeling like I have given up on a task before it was done, I think of it as a way to set myself up for the next time chunk.",1329064302

My self-indulgent dream:  an IDE built around text editor integration.  Think Eclipse, but constructed as an exoskeleton that Emacs and Vim could slip into and become real IDEs.<p>Of course <i>my</i> priorities would come to the fore.  The core would be written in a concise but statically typed language, plugins could be written in the same language or in a clean, concise scripting language.  It would be trivial to run code from within the editor.  And it would be nice if one day it generalized into an application framework like Eclipse.<p>2.  My actually socially productive work:  interactive educational software.  I would construct interactive software specialized for very small units of learning.  An app to teach French verb conjugations, an app to teach the concept of electron valence, an app students could use to interact with a writing coach, an app to teach basic programming, and so on.  I would try to implement what had been learned from studies about learning, and it would be awesome if I could provide a research platform for education research.<p>In the end, I hope that the software work on teaching individual subjects would generalize to a set of templates for interactive learning that would let people construct reasonably effective interactive learning tools for many different subjects, with a reasonable investment of effort.  Just as a software engineer would look at a problem and construct a solution out of well-known systems, an educator could look at the material and skills they want to teach in a class and construct an interactive course from different parts:  spaced repetition to teach certain information, an interactive coaching module and a drill module for medium-complexity skills involving several steps, a submit/teacher review/revision  module for writing tasks, and a portfolio module for the semester project.  Those are the kinds of general modules that come to mind now, but the aim of constructing completely ad hoc software for a variety of subjects would be to discover novel design patterns for interactive learning.<p>Custom modules created by teachers, researchers, and hackers could be trivially published, for free or for sale, and incorporated into course-specific modules or explored by self-guiding students.  Utopia!  (Whew.)<p>P.S.  If I had to show ads to cover support and operations costs, I would only show them to adults, and I would let people pay to turn them off.

Making a Dwarf Fortress clone would take many years, however culling down the feature set (and the depth of each features) to the actual ""fun bits"" at least makes it <i>possible</i>.  So it's not even cutting the breadth of features, but also their depth.  No need for complex climate or economy simulations, etc.  No need for insane descriptiveness of objects (save for artifacts).  It's a lot of complexity that reduces its appeal to a lot of folks (though caters very well to a specific targeted audience).  Dwarf Fortress with a touch interface and cute graphics won't magically broaden it's appeal -- the core game needs to be streamlined and no longer be daunting to newcomers.<p>For example, no massive world at worldgen with full history and legends.  Most people don't want to deal with complexity, they just want an embark site to start in and get to work on.  It takes a lot of time to create those things that the majority of folks would never notice or appreciate.<p>There's a lot of satisfaction with gathering/growing food, building basic shops and homes, defending against threats, creating a trade industry, and a bit of dungeoneering.  However one of Dwarf Fortress's strength is it presents a lot of competing interests -- where you need to weigh building defenses with industry, etc.  Plus the occasional ""oh shit"" moment where the game attempts to stomp on your sand castle.",1329063642

Edit:  I really should have added more context!  The challenge was:<p><i>Using the JavaScript language, have the function guestChallenge() add up all of the numbers from 1 to 1000. But everytime a number that contains a 7 is reached, don't add that number to the others (ie. exclude 7, 17, 370, etc). Do not put any code outside of the function and use the return keyword to return your answer from within the function. </i><p>And my program didn't generate any output at all, which leads me to believe I made a syntax error as opposed to just a logic error.<p>Edit again:  Yes. I just had to fix my typing error (""toSring""), and then it passed.  Thanks, guys!",1329062830

I want to make a Dwarf Fortress-like game for iPad, with a top-down 2.5D perspective, sprite graphics in a cel-shaded style, and culled down to the core elements I find to be most entertaining (with influences from other games I enjoy).  It's a game I want to play, but I'm probably the only person on the planet willing to make it.  However I'd also like to raise Dwarf Fortresses's visibility through my work, and get it some additional exposure to ensure DF development can continue.  I've also a few concepts for iPhone games that scratch some other itches of mine, but the iPad game I at least have written a basic rendering and pathfinding engine already.<p>However I need to line up other work for the time being (should only take a few weeks).

Around here (FL), the startup culture is still not such that our entrepreneurship program really gives deep insight into starting a web-based business.<p>There is a lot of cross-over between the web and more traditional markets, but a lot of the details still need to be culled from experience. As you said, the really nice thing is that you find a lot of like-minded, entrepreneurial people -- which is often one of the harder parts.",1207925996

Web software may represent a legitimate threat to Microsoft someday, but it seems the more immediate concern ought to be that they can barely develop software anymore. It took 6 years to get from Windows 95/NT to Windows XP -- a huge step forward in so many ways. Then 6 years later, Vista brought us what, exactly? Worse performance on the same hardware? A pretty new interface that practically requires a 3D graphics card to open the start menu? DRM? A completely reorganized interface offering negligible improvements over the old one?  A privilege escalation implementation that causes as many problems as it solves? An eye-popping $319.95 price tag for the ""full"" version? Sign me up...",1207925822

For instance, Valleywag was one of the few blogs to question the Second Life hype a few years back, while practically every mainstream media publication was gushing about all of the great business potential there.<p>Valleywag also highlighted some of the negative goings-on with Wikipedia under Jimmy Wales. Yes, some of the revelations were merely titillating but it also pointed to first-person accounts of alleged financial wrongdoing.<p>The media has an important watchdog role, and Valleywag's coverage, as flawed as it may be, sometimes goes where other reporters and bloggers fear to tread.

The startup time of the VM is a red herring in this case. I too have seen impressive VM uptimes. Almost as good as the OS uptimes I've seen.<p>Java threads are dead easy as threads go. However, I don't believe that they're going to be a sustainable solution as we move forward. As processor counts keep rising and the focus moves from scaling up to scaling out we need to find more easily understood and debuggable abstractions for dealing with a massively parallel world.",1207925273

The home edition of MS Office is $129, which isn't too bad for most home and small business users, and it means they have exact file compatibility with other businesses.<p>I like Open Office, but I would never have bothered to switch except for the fact that I prefer Linux to Windows.<p>I owould say that cash-strapped startups and nonprofits are the most likely groups to switch to Open Office in particular, though I expect just as many OO.o switchers are actually people who switch to Linux and use OO.o by default.

I know that I can speak for myself and my peers that these mythical $100K positions that companies are having <i>such</i> a hard time filling are pretty hard to come by.<p>This move by DHS looks like blatant brown-nosing to corporate interests who have been pushing this ""shortage"" crap in order to cut their bottom line.  It's pretty clear that cost cutting is the main motive when the average H-1B worker is paid thousands less than the average native employee in the same field.<p>P.S.  I understand that companies DO have a hard time finding talent.  The market is filled to the brim with JavaSchool clones that flood HR departments with hundreds of resumes week after week.  The companies should, however, actually try to <i>reach out</i> to good talent instead of just wading through piles of resumes.",1207923941

The good thing is that you avoid analysis paralysis (by not thinking too much) and prevent a lot of effort (as a kid, I used to be guilty of being lazy but today I understand that hard work is overrated anyway). On the other hand, you can end up in a dead end. So, from now, I continue to move through small steps (I don't believe in bold moves) but I also ""look deeper in the tree""; I think about the next step as well when I look at a path, to avoid being trapped in a dead end (of course, I learned to do this because I ended up in a dead end recently). I have a vague idea of a few ultimate goals I'd like to achieve, but not a crystal clear vision so they're rather irrelevant to my small steps. But it's OK as long as the decisions I make lead to better opportunities.",1194850367

Sure, machines are faster, we've got more bandwitdth, etc., but we're still ""automating"" stuff, rather than transcending the ""pink plane"".<p>Or, is it just that I've spent too much time at the dayjob, hacking Java together to make the customer happy?",1194849870
78638,comment,78594,78635,0,0,curi,,,"High level human personalities aren't hardwired. They are many layers of interpretation above any hardwiring. It's like imagining that which assembly language is under your Ruby makes a difference to which programs you can write.",1194849869

It is a set of Chinese standing exercise similar to Taiji and Yoga,that uses a simple visualization approach. <p><a href=""http://jadedragon.com/archives/martarts/yiquan01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jadedragon.com/archives/martarts/yiquan01.html</a> <p>Good luck.\n",1194849859
78636,comment,78472,78472,0,0,kmt,,,"Yoga, tai-chi, kung-fu, swimming, water polo, running, skating, skiing, snowboard, surfing, windsurfing, kite-surfing, dancing, push-ups, sit-ups, breathing exercises, shower (especially cold one) are all things that I personally try to do as often as my time allows.  I start my day with yoga and try to do at least one other of the above mentioned activities during the day.  Any of these will do.  Even just getting off the computer for a while will also help a little.<p>Alcohol, coffee, online porn, energy drinks, drugs, cigarettes are all bad ideas.<p>If you choose to believe ayurveda (the ancient Indian medicine) you need to have equal amounts of ""Sun"" and ""Moon"" activities during the day.  Sleep, computer usage, reading are all Moon activities.  All of us here do way too much of them.  To stay in shape we need to counter-balance them with some team sports, interacting with people, running, jumping, playing, etc.  BTW, meditation, although it's very effective, is also a Moon activity.  \n",1194849660

It seems to be, as the article said, ""a fundamental and instinctual aspect of existence"". A lot of stuff is just built into us, and touch=comfort is a prime candidate for one of those things that's hard-wired into us. I doubt it's a culturally acquired/transmitted trait.",1194849335

78630,comment,78588,78588,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Pretty close to all the gold medalists at last year's ACM competition were regular competitors on TopCoder, including the majority of the MIT team (and the coach). <p>The role of culture can't be underestimated: in some places academic competitions are a really big deal. There are major centers for it: St. Peterburg in Russia, Waterloo in Canada, Zhejiang University and Shanghai Jiao Tong in China, and especially Warsaw University in Poland.<p>Just competing in TopCoder over the past year or so, I've solved literally hundreds of tricky algorithmic problems, under heavy time pressure, exactly. The best competitors have solved literally thousands of difficult challenges. It's really no wonder that they do so well. However, I don't think it's unfathomable discipline: I think it's an environment that encourages it. ",1194848118

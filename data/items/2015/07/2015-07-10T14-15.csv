2) Embodiment (the fact that I have a body and the body has feedback loops - affects and is affected by cognition);

One thing I&#x27;ve found it really useful for is isolating build slaves in Jenkins (using the docker-cloud plugin in Jenkins).<p>I also like to use it to create test deployments for debugging or evaluating things, for example it&#x27;s a lot easier to run Hadoop in pseudo-distributed mode inside a Docker container with host networking, than it is to fiddle with running it in a VM and either getting NAT or DNS working just right, or installing it locally. With the Docker container, if anything goes awry, it&#x27;s just so easy to get back to initial state by killing the container and starting again.<p>As for Vagrant, I like it a lot too, but for different reasons. You can define a set of actions that is a lot closer to installing whatever it is you are developing, instead of baking everything together like you do with Docker, which can be desirable. I have used it in the past for creating virtualized cluster environments for integration testing of distributed systems.

9863970,comment,9862556,9862556,0,0,jaawn,,,"Based on all of the coding &quot;best practices&quot; books/blogs I&#x27;ve read, it is unwise to develop something which heavily depends on the internal implementation of the String class (or any library class).  Many other commenters here are bemoaning the impacts the specific implementation of String will have on their existing applications.  However, we should be designing based on the interface/contract presented, not specific implementation details of interfaces/libraries.  Any optimization based on specific implementation details is &quot;at your own risk.&quot;<p>If changes to the implementation of String could cause issues for you, you really should be using a custom solution anyway.  A quick and dirty option would be to write a wrapper class which uses all of your preferred String hacks in a central location, and using that in place of String throughout your code.  When String&#x27;s implementation changes, you can update your hacks all in one place.<p>Here is some relevant advice from The Pragmatic Programmer: <a href=""https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/coincidence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/coinc...</a>",1436536839
9863969,comment,9863538,9863538,0,0,nahiluhmot,,,"> Data persistence support is not out-of-the-box.<p>This is actually not the case. Although containers do not share any persistent volumes with the host by default, you can use the --volume option[0] to do so.<p>To answer your question, I&#x27;ve used Docker for local development to run MySQL, Postgres, and Redis inside of containers. Using the aforementioned --volume option, you can share the unix socket opened by either of these services from the container to the host. Otherwise, you can use the --port option[1] to share ports between the container and the host.<p>I&#x27;ve had a generally pleasant experience using Docker for this use case and would recommend it. It&#x27;s nice being able to start using a new service by pulling and running an image. Similarly, it&#x27;s nice to have the ability to clear the state by removing the container, assuming you choose not to mount volumes between the container and the host.<p>The only frustration I&#x27;ve run into is running out of disk because I have too many images, but it takes a while to get to that point and those can easily be deleted.<p>[0] <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesys...</a>

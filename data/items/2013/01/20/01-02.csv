5085644,comment,5080001,5084391,1,0,ebcase,,,"> One of the saving graces of the vipassana course for me is they didn't expect you to believe what they were saying, but rather believe in your own experience. That sort of honesty I can respect.<p>Yes! I really dug this about the Vipassana teachings. They also emphasize that you can ""leave out"" (per the ""black stone in the oatmeal"" analogy) any of the intellectual aspects that don't sit well with you.<p>I suspect that for most of us, just sticking with a regular practice of breathing (anapana) and sensation observation (vipassana) is enough to keep us busy for the rest of our lives, without adding on intellectual components like kalapas, what happens after we die, etc.",1358647096

It is not the hotel owners' job to act as a police force.<p>> The owners of the hotel repeatedly admitted under oath that they had continuing knowledge of drug crimes occurring on their premises, and had no policies to investigate the use of their rooms.<p>Knowledge that crimes have occurred in the past does not mean that the hotel owners had a duty to act as an unpaid police force.",1358647051

Some people project forward, saying that if automation continues as it has been, there will be no jobs left that humans can do better than machines, and we'll be frozen in a situation where those that own the means of production at that point will continue to own the means of production, without any opportunity for people who don't own means of production (other than their own labour) to earn capital, as their labour is now obsolete.<p>I personally disagree with the latter part of the argument,  I personally think we can find new productive things for the unskilled to do, but I can understand where they are coming from.  That is, certainly, the current trend.<p>But, I do think it's important to acknowledge that we do have an imbalance right now.

The entire basis for the US legal system is that laws serve the interest of the people, not that laws are handed down from above or that the law itself has any moral or ethical justification.  If society's interests are no longer served by a law -- and it is hard to argue that in the case of academic publishing, copyrights actually serve society's interests -- then the law should <i>repealed</i>.<p>""Do prosecutors and judges have to agree with that statement? What happens when they don't?""<p>They become the targets of congressional investigations, which is what is happening to Carmen Ortiz right now.  It is horrifying that it took the death of a man with a bright future to bring this issue to the public's attention, but now that everyone is looking it is good to see Congress doing something that helps people for a change.  Minute as the response from Congress has been, it is at least a step in the right direction.<p>""prosecutors and judges have to enforce the law as it is""<p>No they don't.  Prosecutors have to <i>serve the interests of the public</i> and are expected to <i>decline prosecution</i> in cases where they are asked to prosecute someone whose actions were potentially illegal but both benefited the public and were neither harmful nor dangerous.  Judges are expected to <i>strike down laws</i> that violate the constitution, and to give light or suspended sentences to people who are guilty of violating the law but whose imprisonment or punishment would do nothing to benefit society.  The idea that prosecutors and judges have some kind of obligation to enforce laws that are clearly misguided is on the level of the fallacy that juries have a duty to convict if the evidence shows a defendant is guilty (jury nullification is an important check on laws that the public disagrees with).<p>""does it make scanning and digitzing old paper journals free also? Does it make it so that data entry techs typing in metadata describing old paper journals don't have to paid?""<p>That is an organizational problem, not a technology or legal issue.  Universities could do this via their library system, or we could set up a system where people who voluntarily scan articles or write metadata get preferential treatment when they search or download (think of BitTorrent trackers that give preferential treatment to users with higher seed ratios).  For that matter, why should we have to rely on a single organization or system?  Maybe you are better than I am when it comes to entering metadata; maybe other people would rather trust your metadata over mine.  Maybe we could set up something like a web of trust.<p>It is not like this <i>could not</i> be done; it is more like <i>the law stops it</i> in order to protect an obsolete business model.<p>""How are we going to do that exactly?""<p>Here's a suggestion:  exclude scientific articles from copyright restrictions.  If you want a compromise, how about this:  exclude those articles for which the research was paid for with tax dollars from copyright.  As a first step, that would not be so bad.  Let the copyright battle be exclusive to entertainment and software, and leave human knowledge out of it.<p>We are already questioning the CFAA as a result of this case.  Why not question copyrights as well?<p>""So, copyright laws will be enforced when it comes to stealing proprietary source code, but not for old journals?""<p>That would at least be a step in the right direction.<p>""Is it that copyright law shouldn't be enforced because you've decided journal publishers are rapacious parasites (I think they are too actually)? Or that copyright law should only get enforced for entities that contribute something to human knowledge?""<p>It is that copyright law <i>was meant to ensure our access to the knowledge that journal publishers publish</i>, but that in today's world it is actually making that knowledge harder to access.  The copyright system was never meant to ensure that the authors of scholarly articles would be paid; it was meant to ensure that the <i>publishing system would be monetized</i>.  At the time, the publishing industry was the best way to make enough copies of scientific journals to satisfy society's need, and the publishing system is expensive and must be paid for.  Everything other than the distribution of articles is irrelevant to copyrights, because everything else is done by volunteers (writing, reviewing, and editing) and would continue to be done regardless of money.<p>We no longer need that system, because we have a distribution system that is substantially more efficient and less costly.  Copyright is no longer promoting the <i>best</i> system for distributing scholarly articles; it is now <i>preventing the use of that system</i> and promoting an anachronistic system that by today's standards is shockingly inefficient.  It seems reasonable to conclude that copyrights should simply not be applied to academic publishing, at least as copyrights currently exist, and that a new legal framework that promotes the use of the Internet should be enacted.<p>Sure, there are hurdles.  Publishers serve as archives, they pay people to insert metadata, and sometimes they even scan older articles for us.  I fail to see how these activities could not be accomplished with the publishing industry.  Universities already have more than enough computer capacity to act as archives (I know a professor who took the time to scan <i>his entire library</i>, thousands of textbooks -- it fits on a couple of external hard drives sitting on his desk, with room to spare for storing all patents ever granted in all countries).  Metadata is something that could be done as a community, perhaps via some sort of system as I had mentioned above, or it could be done by the universities themselves <i>as a one-time cost for old articles</i> (metadata for new articles could be inserted automatically when those articles are published).  Scanners are not hard to find -- my school's library makes many available to patrons, I have one on my desk, and my department has many as well (and of course, I know someone who scanned thousands of books on his own); again, we could create a system that incentivizes scanning as a community effort, or rely on universities to do it.  If we actually cared about the original goal of copyrights as related to academic publishing, we would be investing some time in finding better ways to do things now that we have the technology to do so.<p>You could summarize the argument like this:  <i>the law is standing in the way of the sort of progress that society is desperately in need of; therefore, changing the law is imperative</i>.",1358644673

One of the virtues of Twitter is that this approach is feasible because of their character limit, and it means that should anything happen to Twitter (or the internet) in the future, that anything of cultural importance* is preserved. It also allows the tweet to be read offline or in countries where Twitter might be censored or banned, but where the paper is available. Proper citation is just to enable verification if necessary.<p>(*though admittedly this is probably a very small subset of all tweets)",1358644303

We don't have to wait for a black Aaron Swartz to act, on the far-fetched premise that the only thing that will be noticed by prosecutors was his color. This is a far-fetched idea.<p>Federal prosecutors are certainly intelligent enough to understand many of the factors which make this sensitive, including a suicide, internet backing, the specific alleged crime and the open access issue. Without deciding that the whole problem is that you can't prosecute white people. So many white people are prosecuted without fanfare that this would be an impossibly irrational conclusion to draw.",1358643780

Oh and if you want to go trial it will cost you and your family years of drama, all your savings, and risk 50 years in prison"".<p>The charges weren't ridiculous. If Aaron wanted to avoid the trial he could simply have avoided repeatedly breaking into MIT's open network to access JSTOR. The charges (even the amended ones) were approved by a grand jury. The prosecutors were never pushing for 50 years in prison.<p>See, this is all part of what I complained about in my other comment about prevarication.<p>But either way, the point is kind of moot. Aaron <i>chose</i> to be in that situation, they didn't change the legal code just to suit him. Taking the plea would have been the smart thing but he was never under any obligation, as the sentence he would get in a jury trial would be based on the Federal sentencing guidelines (and his expensive attorneys could tell him that too).<p>Regarding the Sixth Amendment, plea bargaining is one of the tools used to ensure that those who <i>do</i> need jury trials have a chance at getting them expeditiously (or do you really think that Google really has a 5GB hard disk partition sets aside for <i>everyone</i> with a GMail account?).",1358643767

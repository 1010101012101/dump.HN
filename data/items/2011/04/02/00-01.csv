There are women in my life who've shown such courage and strength and selflessness that I know I could not of as a child, and I hope to be be capable of too someday.

Some developers like Windows, that's fine, but just as many hate it. It's not wrong for a developer to use Windows, but it is wrong for a company to impose it, or even to have it as the default option.<p>For a company to say ""at our company, we use Windows"" is to say ""We don't give a shit about developers"". The issue isn't Windows, the issue is a workplace culture that places the preferences of management over the preferences of developers.

2398762,comment,2398238,2398352,3,0,jarrett,,,"They've done a fine job of keeping the site responsive, but that's only a small part of what we normally demand from web apps.<p>I don't fault them for spam. It's a very, very difficult problem, and since I don't have a magical solution to propose, I'm not going to complain.<p>But there are a few areas where CL could have made major improvements at a reasonable cost, especially considering their revenue. They could have at least experimented with some of these ideas, and tossed them out later if they turned out to be bad. Here are some of the main opportunities I think CL has missed:<p>-Richer data, tailored to each category. CL started down this road, e.g. by adding the rent field. But there's so much more they could do in every category.<p>-Better searching. With the huge volume of posts to sort through--and the large number of duplicate posts--the basic search features currently implemented fall flat. Improvements in this area would probably have to tie in with the richer data set mentioned above.<p>-Abandon the serial model, where the database is just a chronological list of posts. This model creates an arms race to be the person who posts the most frequently without getting flagged. In other words, it incentivizes the fine art of sneaking what amounts to spam just below the radar.<p>The core problem, as I see it, is that CL still views their service as an extension of its original incarnation: a mailing list. In the CL model, a listing is just arbitrary text and maybe some metadata if you're lucky, and the listings simply appear in reverse chronological order. Sounds like a mailing list archive to me.<p>Sure, that's how CL got started, but why not grow into something better? There's clearly enough usage and revenue to justify a realignment. Rather than ""sticking with what works,"" I think this is a case of inertia.",1301705651
2398761,comment,2398597,2398597,8,0,jrockway,,,"I have one.  Let's write a REPL in Python:<p><pre><code>   result = eval string\n   print result\n</code></pre>\nWow, so easy.  Except it doesn't work when string contains ""import foo"".  OK, that's fine, we can ""exec"" instead of ""eval"".  Oh, but then we don't get the return value anymore.<p>(The Python solution to this is a flag to pass to exec to tell it to print the result to stdout.  If you want to capture the object that's the result, well, too fucking bad.  I did this in my Python REPL with an AST rewrite of the user's input.  What the fuck!?)<p>In Perl, you can `eval $string' and the return value is the return value of the code you just ran.  And any Perl works!<p>I've never written any Perl that looks like what this article uses. If I want to slurp a file, I say ""my $file = read_file('path/to/file')"".  read_file comes from File::Slurp.  If I want to do strict validation of the arguments to my function, I just use Params::Validate (or MooseX::Declare if my blood sugar is low).  (Why do you care about number of arguments but not type of arguments?  So you get an obscure error when you try to use ""1"" as a hash?)  Perl has classes, Perl has exceptions.  If you say it doesn't, like the author of this post, you don't know anything about Perl.<p>So my point is, it's easy for fanbois to hand-pick examples of why a language is bad, especially when they don't even know the language.  It's all very simple in practice: to program well in a programming language, you have to learn the language.  Try not doing that, and you will fail, even if that language is Python!",1301705626

You pick your first job after the freshman year.  At that stage in the game, I had no idea what I would find most rewarding (I was in an electrical and computer science program, which left a lot of room to choose).<p>Most companies sent engineers to the campus recruiting center.  They tended to ask dry questions about classes and training.  The guy from RCA Semiconductor was personable, warm, and knew how to sell his company.  He also ""got"" that frosh aren't really at the stage where grilling them on technical knowledge makes much sense when deciding who to take a chance on, so he steered the conversation more toward life experiences, interests, and working style.<p>I went with RCA, with no reservations.  Happily for me, it turned out that Tom reflected the company culture in the factory that sent him.  Was it the ""best"" decision?

You create the network equivalent of the 'Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval'.<p>Typically the way that works is that someone diligently looks at every app and provides a rating based clear and transparent metrics. They do this in a largely unsung fashion as early adopters or randomly curious people begin to validate that their ratings correlate strongly with actual quality.<p>Then, once they reach critical mass, the app vendors will attempt to corrupt them (or at least influence them) by sending them 'free' apps or 'previews' which don't exactly match what they actually ship. Depending on whether or not this new effort has been around the block before they will either lose all credibility once they highly rate and app where the 'review copy' was significantly different than the 'store copy.' Or they have some other fail mechanism (like not actually reviewing the app instead trusting some third party's opinion)<p>If they dodge that bullet they will begin to grow in influence as more and more people will start using their ratings but that will also increase the demand rate (""Why haven't you rated app Donglefritz yet?"") now it will switch from being something they were doing because they and their friends were tired of all the crappy apps and gaming the app store ratings, and it will start feeling like work because they are feeling pressure to get more and more apps rated. Also apps they rate poorly will start complaining, and some of them might try to intimidate them with legal proceedings (justified or not).<p>Suddenly the value equation will be all pear shaped, they will want to stop but too many people are counting on them. They will want to find some way to 'monetize' all this work since they are getting poor reviews at their day job (or no sleep) because of all the time they are spending rating iPhone/pad apps. They start taking advertisements and have to deal with how an app they rate poorly actually gets lots of downloads because the same app is advertised in their tool or on their site. The ad isn't an endorsement but they need to figure out how to explain that to their customers who previously only had messages coming from them that were not paid for.<p>Typically it is at this point where they 'sell' their brand, apologize and move on with their new found wealth swearing that 'next time' they won't cave in like that. Their new owners will milk the brand by turning it into a pay for play mouth piece for app vendors which will easily double their investment (since the brands legitimacy will die more slowly than the value of the rankings).<p>Once the brand is completely discredited and usage has dropped it will quietly fold and disappear never to be heard from again.<p>Oh, I'm sorry you wanted a solution? :-)",1301703983

Radioactive isotopes (such as those coming from Fukushima) tend to emit both, as they decay into non-radioactive elements.  So once an atom emits radiation, it's done radiating (unless it's decayed into another radioactive particle, but eventually it'll hit something stable and never radiate ever again).<p>So the isotopes arrive at some rate, and they decay into non-radioactive elements over time.  (That's what the ""8-day half-life"" in the article means: after 8 days, only half of it will be left.)  At some point, the Japanese engineers will get everything cleaned up, no more isotopes will arrive, and all isotopes will eventually decay.<p>Even if the Japanese take their sweet time getting things cleaned up, the isotopes are still decaying over time, so they won't accumulate unless the Japanese truly screw up and start releasing increasing amounts of isotopes.",1301703490

APT has more or less been poisoned as a term lately (see comodo, etc.) and amounts to the latest scapegoat scenario. ""See, we can't be blamed! It's an APT!"" is what I'm betting the RSA board hopes is the take away here.<p>Of course they could also know something pretty significant that they're not telling. What was taken and how tough it was to get at internally could be a flag. If there was a really significant or telling element to the attack it may well be that they've been asked not to reveal it. Not that I'd bet on that side of the line.",1301702921

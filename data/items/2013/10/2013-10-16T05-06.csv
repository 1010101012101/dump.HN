6558222,comment,6557484,6558181,2,0,objclxt,,,"> you would almost certainly have to reveal the exploit publicly in a court.<p>That&#x27;s definitely not true. Often police and prosecutors will go to great lengths to hide a wiretap from the courts, especially if direct evidence didn&#x27;t come from it. There have also been many cases where wiretaps haven&#x27;t been disclosed in court because there may be on-going related operations that require the same surveillance. You don&#x27;t want to tip people off. I don&#x27;t see why any potential exploit wouldn&#x27;t be the same.<p>Here&#x27;s an example: say you&#x27;re investigating some organised crime. You learn from a wiretap that the next day one of your informants is going to be killed. You clearly want to prevent the latter without disclosing you&#x27;ve got an active wiretap.",1381902728

6558215,comment,6552739,6553584,1,0,chaitanya,,,"Great points. I agree with some of them, but disagree with others.<p>> The structure of the API encourages passing the entire context around everywhere, which basically turns all of these objects into global variables.<p>I don&#x27;t see it that way. In many cases, you don&#x27;t need to pass around a context, you can directly pass the objects that you need to work on. And even when you do pass the context, its not as if you go through its -registeredObjects. You would usually get your objects using a fetch request -- how is it different from fetching your objects directly using SELECT over a db connection?<p>> For example, ObjectiveRecord[1] adds class methods for looking up objects using a predicate. Modularity? Separation of concerns? Perish the thought.<p>I really don&#x27;t see how this is bad for modularity or separation of concerns? Can you please elaborate?<p>> At the large scale, you don&#x27;t want to load everything into memory so you need a better scheme, but then you need something like SQLite so you can avoid the slowness and gain more control.<p>But Core Data does support SQLite as a backend, and it allows you to easily load only a subset of your data. Just create a fetch request with the appropriate predicate and you can work with just the objects you need.<p>One of the things that is definitely slow though is if you want to mass update or delete a significant number of your objects. In that case you would have to load all the objects in memory and update or delete them one by one, which can be a pain if you need to do this a lot (whereas with SQLite a simple UPDATE or DELETE statement would have sufficed).<p>Another reason for slowness historically has been that if you use two different contexts (say for multi-threading reasons), then in order to transfer updated information from one context to another you had to first save the information to disk, and only then could you fetch the updated info on the other context. The alternative to this is to lock the context and objects explicitly which has its own problems. However, with the introduction of parent contexts and new concurrency types in iOS 5, it is not a problem anymore. If a context has its parent context set, then when it saves its changes, they won&#x27;t got to disk -- the changes are only registered in the parent context.<p>Core Data is not perfect at all, but I don&#x27;t think it is completely unusable either.",1381902670

They keep the front end sites operating the same but it&#x27;s all the same on the back end. They&#x27;ve done it so many times that they&#x27;ve gotten quite good at the migrations, and then whatever random hardware the original company was using is discarded. Usually noone from the company being taken over ends up working for them, support is sent to their offshore call centres (who actually do a decent job). Most web hosting companies are fairly small operations and usually have a single owner or maybe a few partners who are just bought out and the employees are all let go.<p>They&#x27;re able to maintain the appearance of having a bunch of competing companies and you can shop around for the best deal, which they will change around periodically, but it&#x27;s always the same thing underneath.<p>Source: Worked for two webhosts acquired by EIG.",1381902416

You could contest it for ~ 60 days, but you&#x27;d have to sign something at the bank, and you&#x27;re out the money till you do.<p>2) Drafts. They&#x27;re like checks, but not. Some health clubs (Curves, iirc) do this as well as some other less reputable businesses.  Basically, once you sign an authorization (that they keep on file, not like it gets passed to the bank or anything), they can print a check like thing and put some specific language in the signature block area, and deposit it. Typically, this is done in bulk. Often times, it&#x27;s then immediately converted into an electronic equivalent check (Check21 law) and then deposited in one big file.

&quot;<p>Sorry, but no. Also, I was addressing points made about LLVM IR, and the asm.js specification, as well as it&#x27;s suitability as a compiler IR.  I&#x27;ve used asm.js, i&#x27;ve read and understood the current optimizing compiler implementation, as well as the published roadmaps and mailing lists.<p>I don&#x27;t appreciate the unrelated attack, it was completely unwarranted and unnecessary.  The fact that I don&#x27;t agree with you does not mean &quot;I haven&#x27;t used it&quot;.<p>&quot; So the behavior isn&#x27;t &#x27;undefined&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;<p>You completely misunderstand undefined behavior.<p>The behavior is undefined, it is simply verified at compile time that the program does not perform it.  That does not make it less undefined, it makes the program &quot;statically checked&quot; as opposed to &quot;dynamically checked&quot; or &quot;not checked at all&quot; (like most C, though it&#x27;s worth pointing out it&#x27;s entirely legal for a C compiler to reject code producing undefined behavior, it&#x27;s only required to accept implementation defined behavior).<p>Exactly as I said, C programs (or others) that exhibit undefined behavior are in fact  noncomforming, in exactly the same way that the asm.js program would be noncomforming. The only difference is when and whether checking and rejection of nonconforming behavior is performed.<p>If you are going to argue about language specifications, and make claims about them, you need to be precise.<p>pcwalton likely meant to make the claim that asm.js itself is safer because it has no undefined behavior at runtime, as it rejects programs that may exhibit undefined behavior at compile time (or something similar), which is at least possible to be true, though i would have a lot of trouble believing it without some formal proof (the spec offers none).  It is incredibly hard  to actually come up with things like this that are completely statically decidable and still useful.<p>Your definition of behavior that does not meet the spec as &quot;defined&quot; because &quot;it works the way it all regular JS normally does&quot; is a hilarious new definition of &#x27;defined behavior&#x27;.<p>Also, would you like to refute any other point I have made about how pcwalton has completely misrepresented a lot about LLVM IR?",1381900799

So the behavior isn&#x27;t &#x27;undefined&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t work. The AOT compiler rejects it and it runs as regular JS, in which case the behavior is &#x27;defined&#x27; in that it works the way all other regular JS does.<p>asm.js is specced and there&#x27;s a verifier; if you pass the verifier your code should behave predictably in an AOT-compiling runtime. The runtime isn&#x27;t producing code that does dynamic type checks at runtime or other sorts of nondeterministic behavior.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible that some undefined behavior slipped into the spec somewhere, but I definitely haven&#x27;t seen any actual examples where they specced it and the Firefox implementation generates undefined behavior on purpose. That would be insane. asm.js delivers the same safety guarantees as regular JS; you can&#x27;t do that with undefined behavior ala C.<p>Ultimately if you have concerns about the safety of asm.js or the presence of undefined behavior, you should test it and report bugs. I&#x27;ve tested asm.js some and played around with it and have not found any reason to be concerned.",1381900119

6558098,comment,6553794,6558086,2,0,kevingadd,,,"A broken inlining heuristic is not going to have the kind of performance consequences for an asm.js app that you get when you get dropped into the interpreter/baseline JIT in a javascript app today.<p>A function not getting inlined means the addition of function call overhead, and that&#x27;s it, in most cases. Dropping into an interpreter or baseline jit can literally produce a 100x slowdown, or worse.<p>Any conforming asm.js implementation that does AOT compilation will produce predictable performance. Yes, individual implementations will differ, but the same is true when you compile applications against MSVC, Clang, and GCC. You don&#x27;t see anyone arguing that Clang and MSVC should have standardized inlining heuristics, do you?<p>It&#x27;s important to remember, also, that when we say things like &#x27;JIT sweet spot&#x27; we&#x27;re not just referring to what code you wrote. It also matters what code you run, in which order, with which arguments. Something as simple as changing the order in which you call some functions (without changing the actual code in those functions) can cause them to deopt in modern runtimes because the heuristics are so sensitive to minor changes in data. Those kind of variances can be caused by something as simple as a HTTP request taking a bit longer to complete and changing the startup behavior of your app.",1381899714

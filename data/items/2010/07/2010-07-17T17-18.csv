This means it takes longer to build your product, and you end up paying a lot more in salary.<p>By having an office (usually only a few hundred, to a few thousand dollars a month in expense), you are able to save a lot in salary (tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a month), because your team will be more focused and productive.",1279389591

If you learn that much, you can place out of the courses where you learn C. However, if you learn only part of C and still have to take the course, you will have to suffer through many lessons teaching you what you already know. I say this from experience – I learned Java in high school and was taught C++ in college (just finished my freshman year), and about half the lessons were about stuff I already know, like the difference between a value and a reference/pointer to that value, and what an object is, and how while loops work, and other exceedingly boring stuff like that.

1524256,comment,1523886,1523886,0,0,lionhearted,,,"It's just a disconnect in cultures - when an old school businessperson uses the term ""human resources"", they don't actually mean it in a negative, malicious, or callous way. The term partially started out that way during war planning - ""our natural resources and our human resources to fight the war"" - but it evolved to get a positive meaning to it in the 50's and 60's. Positive psychologists would talk about how ""natural resources are wasted by using them up, but human resources are wasted by not using them"", and it became a pleasant term.<p>Think about it - almost all personnel departments are called HR for a reason; it used to have very positive connotations. The term kind of devolved as the modern corporate culture grew, and it's kind of an anachronism that a young businessman is more careful of using. I'd guess the term will completely leave usage in the next 20-40 years.<p>Its usage when it grew in popularity was generally understood to be a positive thing - something similar to what happened to the word ""welfare"", which used to have overwhelmingly positive connotations as ""the welfare of the people."" Now welfare is out, social safety net is in. Likewise, human resources is gradually being replaced; actually, the main reason it's hanging around is probably because there isn't a really clear alternative term for ""all organizationally-yet-not-operationally-focused personnel decisions.""",1279389056

If the value of C++ were accessed at that line, a temporary would be generated to access the original C value, and then after the line C would be incremented.<p>The idea is that most other languages are ++C. or ++A. The operation isn't straddled across two lines. Backwards compatibility with another language (C) isn't so important. And all the language features aren't generated implicitly without a real clear idea about the design (i.e., via temporaries).<p>On the other hand, it is possible to program in something like ++C -- no temporaries -- by consciously going through and picking which features you like in C++, and not waiting for them to influence your design in some weird way (hence these types of posts about C++, and how different programmers have different takes on the language -- and different tools, moc, etc.). That is, if you want to write really elegant C++ code, you have to write it with a vengeance. It's not orthogonal really like Python or Ruby. It's much more like Perl. Just as the compiler is generating unnecessary cycles by creating that temporary (9/10), so are the C++ design paradigms often very overlapping and if you're not careful and don't understand them in detail -- they'll create a lot of unnecessary design cycles.<p>But I think with the right tools and the right focused perspective, it's still one of the best languages. It's not forgiving -- and sometimes it's almost misleading -- I mean from the very beginning, you'd think if you wanted simply to increment an integer or an object semantically you'd just foo++ -- but that'd usually be wrong.<p>But the redeeming part about C++ is that all languages make these mistakes. All languages, in trying to improve on their predecessors, make limiting choices that are imperfect and at some point will be optimized or revised in the future. The beauty, if you can call it that, of C++ -- is that because of its performance bent, it doesn't force you to choose any of its features which aren't already in C.",1279386488

Does it cause a problem? Yes. Does anyone just sit there with one finger on the side of the phone? No.<p>Instead, say that a grip natural to a large number of users causes signal loss.",1279386077

That being said the real scandal here has zero to do with the antenna and everything to do with Steve Jobs ham handed response. If they just owned up we wouldn't be tAlking about it as the fix is pretty simple and effective. I suspect jobs didn't because he saw the antenna as a feature instead of a bug.",1279386041

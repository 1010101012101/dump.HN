Now I need around 4 to 6 hours (absolute max) and I never feel tired, even if I work late, 7 days a week etc etc.<p>Over the last 12 years, when I have worked with many people with a wide range of sleep problems, I have discovered that the problem is not in fact that we do not get enough sleep. I think that with the expectations we put on ourselves these days it is almost impossible to get enough sleep. I found that sleep (and food and the other methods we use) is simply not powerful enough to recharge our batteries properly.<p>Probably 50 years ago it was enough to eat 3 meals a day, sleep 8 hours a night, have weekends and a few weeks holidays every year and so on. My grandfather used to work in the City of London (financial district) and they went to the office in the morning, had a long, sociable lunch and didn't do much else for the rest of the day. Look at bankers and other financial people today and there is simply no comparison. So I believe it will become more and more essential for people to find ways of recharging their energy that are much more powerful than sleep, holidays etc. That's why we are seeing an increase in the number of people meditating, doing yoga and lots of other practices that build energy levels as well as rest.",1299822585

If you were born and raised in the US, would you go off to start a startup with two other guys from Tokyo whose culture and mindset might be vastly different from yours?  Or would you do it with your local friends?  Similarly, an entrepreneur from Spain might be a lot more comfortable starting a startup with some fellow Spaniards than Americans.<p>On the flipside, there are benefits to expanding your horizons and you might learn a thing or two from people outside your culture and social sphere who have different perspectives.<p>Because of that, I think the two versions can coexist nicely, rather than one being a substitute for the other.",1299822554

2312299,comment,2311279,2311498,0,0,rbarooah,,,"The sox comment has been explained in numerous places.  Basically because Xcode comes with a purchase of a new Mac or OSX it's considered to be part of the value delivered with that purchase.  If they update it later, it is regarded as delivering additional value <i>to the original purchase</i>. I.e. Some of the money you paid originally is accounted as having paid for the upgrade.  This means that the original transaction wasn't complete until they delivered the upgrade.  This means that Apple can't record all of the 'incomplete' transaction on their balance sheet as revenue.  They could work around this by holding back a percentage to cover later updates but this would be stupidly complicated and they'd still have the problem of not being able to declare it complete until they were certain of never shipping any new update.  Much easier to just charge a nominal fee.<p>Obviously this seems like a Byzantine regulation, but it's not aimed at Apple - it's intended to stop certain kinds of fraud involving counting money received as revenue even though there is still a lot to deliver.<p>As for 'it's about greed' - well they do make a lot of money and that leads people to accuse them of greed.

2312275,comment,2311279,2311504,0,0,bzbarsky,,,"The problem is Sarbanes-Oxley requires compliance with certain accounting practices (to be set by regulators; these are not spelled out in the act).  I'm not an accountant, but as I understand the problem arises in this situation:<p>2005: Company X sells product Y to person Z for $1000.  Company's books show $1000 in revenue.
2006: Company X gives Z a free significant upgrade to product Y and records no revenue.<p>The argument could be made that what really happened was that the company actually made two sales to Z; one in 2005 and one in 2006 and that the revenue of $1000 should properly be split across the two years.<p>Not having such a rule apparently allows various accounting shenanigans in which totally unrelated things are treated as ""free upgrades"" to something else and revenue can be booked in whatever year you want.<p>So there are two important things here for all this to be an issue:
1)  The initial purchase must have cost money.  If you get something for free and then get a free upgrade to it, there's no problem.
2)  The magnitude of the upgrade must be such that one could be accused of slipping an unrelated product in as a ""free upgrade"".<p>So for example security updates to safari would fail test #2 above.  Major updates to iTunes may fail test #1, since iTunes is generally available for free to everyone (even if you don't buy a Mac or MacOS).<p>It's possible that something makes Apple's accountants feel that XCode is part of the OS in a way that means that when you pay for the OS you're also paying for XCode.  And that XCode 4 is enough of a change from XCode 3 that if it were free it would fall afoul of the accounting stuff above.<p>Again, I'm not an accountant, so I could be getting all this totally wrong...",1299821699

Since features are changed on the fly as part of the experiment (think orange names), it doesn't make that much sense to document them.<p>2. PG wishes to avoid an 'Eternal September' on HN. One way of doing this is to model the site directly towards a subset of users (hackers), and create barriers to entry/discouragements of use to the others. The design is simple, and a lot of the site's features are left undocumented. (user profile options, karma milestones for various abilities like poll-creation and downvoting) For those features, a 'hacker' would likely either a) ignore the features if the site already provided proper functionality and they were not relevant, b) be able to figure out what they do based on the names and some quick testing/playing with them, or c) be able to figure this out by Googling/searching.<p>They're described here, for example: <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsnews.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsnews.html</a><p>>Like email, social news sites can be dangerously addictive. So the latest version of Hacker News has a feature to let you limit your use of the site. There are three new fields in your profile, noprocrast, maxvisit, and minaway. (You can edit your profile by clicking on your username.) Noprocrast is turned off by default. If you turn it on by setting it to ""yes,"" you'll only be allowed to visit the site for maxvisit minutes at a time, with gaps of minaway minutes in between. The defaults are 20 and 180, which would let you view the site for 20 minutes at a time, and then not allow you back in for 3 hours. You can override noprocrast if you want, in which case your visit clock starts over at zero.<p>> The reason for the distinction between killing and deleting is to avoid accusations of censorship. Anyone who does want to see the stuff killed by the editors can do it by setting showdead to yes in his profile. But it seemed right to offer submitters a more thorough sort of deletion for their own stuff.<p>So, basically, what I'm saying is that there's <i>no</i> reason to document or describe these features in a clearer manner than how they are currently documented.",1299820426

S/he might actually look at this ""inconvenience"" as fun, exciting, or something equally positive that increases his or her personal confidence upon completion (yes, even when it's just an installer on OS X). Now they have cool new tools available to them. They'd probably have an even greater boost in net positive feelings if Apple provided an Ubuntu-like console window during XCode installation that gave a nice terminal output of all the install's goings-on--s/he might feel a buildup of positive feelings for this systems-level, programmerish, ""geeky"" insider's view.<p>I'm afraid the OP is guilty of looking at the casual new developer from the perspective of the rushed and impatient developer who, like myself, just wants shit to work and work <i>now</i>.<p>When I pause for a moment to look at it from the not-so-casual-anymore user's perspective, however, I remember a good couple of years when I thought I was a badass cos I ran nothing but Gentoo Linux and chrooted, bootstrapped, and compiled every last package on my system from source for days. I'd watch compilations fill the screen and would have bet money I'd just grown an inch. I'd let that stick around a few weeks and then do it all over again for the excitement of it and to see if I could do it from memory.

(Not mildly expensive like today, but like half the specs for 150% of the price.)<p>- Their cloning strategy had totally flopped and eradicated their margins even further.<p>- The Newton, which was pitched as a ""save the company"" thing, had flopped<p>- Apple was trying to sell itself to anyone interested, and nobody would buy<p>- The Wall Street Journal thought there were serious accounting shenanigans going on<p>- And unlike today, they had no consumer electronic products to fall back on.<p>The Mac business was so fucked, it took them about 10 years before they really ""fixed"" it. And I don't think anyone at the time really could have predicted that Apple would become a consumer electronics juggernaut.<p>Still their stock was considered a steal at $15 a share or whatever, and it's depressing to think you missed an opportunity of a lifetime.",1299819658

By my reckoning, Amazon is paying Google who in turn pay a resident of Illinois. How is this different from an Amazon affiliate?",1299819615

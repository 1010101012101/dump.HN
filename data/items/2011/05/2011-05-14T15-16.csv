Mobile phones connect a reasonable percentage of the rest. I may be mistaken but it is doubtful that many users' quality of life would be dramatically affected by the sudden demise of Facebook. It may be as bad as losing your favourite TV channel, but life goes on. Facebook is a convenience that does not solve any of our real problems or alleviate human drudgery in any way, It only increases the enjoyment of existing wealth at idle time.<p>Incidentally, an explicit statement of what mankind's actual goals are and what resources are being committed to solving them would go a long way to show that we really all want the same things. Anyone that believes our interests are best served by large corporations and governments at war is delusional. These entities rely on the premise that success can only come at the expense of the 'other guy'. In the grand scheme of things they are local optima that promote the very scarcity that they have evolved to manage. Open Source Software can teach something here, there are multiple distributions and programs, each freely borrowing from the successes and avoiding the failures of the other. The healthy but open competition between them means that we get the best operating systems that no money can buy. Even OSS is not immune to meaningless rivalries and sabotage.<p>The information age gives us new tools to approach the physical world which is where ALL the real challenges still are, even in computing (think the end of Moore's law, and the potential of quantum computing and communication). You mention mechanical engineering, we should have amazing open-source mechanical modelling software that realistically simulates the physical properties of large systems, allowing you to design, build and test machines from a catalog of reuseable components and subsystems in a virtual lab (Tesla did this in his head), and send it out into the cloud for fabrication and delivery.<p>We all seem to agree that life is hard, why can't we approach it as an engineering problem? I would like to see someone attempt to engineer a society in a systematic scientific way. Evolutionary algorithms, game theory and a few Petaflops of modelling power for the common objective function. No secrecy, sentiment or ideology just let the best algorithms decide.",1305388742

Let's call it the <i>steady-state fallacy</i>:<p><i>If X is impossible over the long run, then X cannot really be happening.</i><p>In the housing market the second-order factor is <i>speculation</i>: During bubbles, like the one that is deflating now, people overpay for housing, way more than the equivalent rent, on the assumption that the house would appreciate. When housing prices fell instead, these people ended up owing more on their mortgage than the housing was worth. But it's better to collect 60% of your mortgage in rent than collect 0% of your mortgage on an empty house, or to live in your house in a town where you have no job.<p>So there are lots of houses and condos that rent for significantly less than they cost to buy.

2547873,comment,2547679,2547679,42,0,mdasen,,,"One of the things that he's critically missed is that it's unfair to only compare the price of buying vs. the price of renting <i>today</i>.  When you purchase a house, your mortgage is set for the term of the mortgage.  Rent is usually only set for a year at a time and does go up.<p>The NY Times buy vs. rent calculator in the article that he links, uses 3% as a baseline rent increase per year.  So, after 5 years, a $1500 rent could be expected to cost $1740.  That's not too impressive if you assume it's a place worth $375k and at his 2% taxes and maintenance price, you'd have $625 in costs in addition to the mortgage - well over the $240 that the rent had risen.  However, after 15 years, that theoretical rent would have risen to $2300 and eclipsed the cost of taxes and maintenance.  Now, as home values rise, taxes would rise with it, but then you own something that you can sell for more money and have made a good investment so it isn't a good argument to say, ""well, one's home could go up in value a lot every year which would mean more taxes.""<p>It depends on what you're buying a property for.  Frankly, the NY Times calculator (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calcula...</a>) is going to be a lot better than my crude calculations.  However, if you're buying a property to stay in for a good while, it can be a better idea to buy.  The costs of selling don't matter that much when you've stayed in a place for a long time.  It also depends on your market.  I've priced things out in the Boston area against rent (more urban than Greenspun), and it really depends on how long you're going to stay in that place.  Most of the cities here offer you a homestead exemption on your property taxes if you live there and it's usually around 200k - meaning that if you buy a place for $400k to live in rather than rent, you're actually only paying half the property tax rate.  The towns tend not to have that exemption.  So, if you want to be in one place for a decade, the calculator shows that buying can be a nice option.<p>Buying a house isn't something to go in for like buying an iPhone and getting a two-year cell phone contract.  It requires a careful look at the costs and that you're relatively settled in life.  It isn't a panacea of money, but it can be cheaper and can be stabilizing.  While it isn't everyone, there are people who really like an area, have a job that won't see them have to move, and would stay in that house for 20-30 years.<p>--<p>Plus, if you look at Trulia's rent-vs-buy index (<a href=""http://trulia.movity.com/rentvsbuy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trulia.movity.com/rentvsbuy/</a>), you'll see that Greenspun has cherry-picked the worst cities to buy to do his calculations.  Trulia notes that in 36 out of its 50 cities studied, it is ""much less expensive to buy than rent"".  That includes real cities like Chicago, Wahsington DC, San Diego, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Atlanta.  He's used a buy-to-rent ratio of 30:1, but the average for the 50 cities shown is 14.22.  So, we live in the Boston area and buying here is an expensive proposition that might not make sense.  However, there are many places that have much more favorable ownership conditions.  If you're in a market where the buy-to-rent ratio is below 15:1, the NY Times calculator will show you how favorable buying is.  And, frankly, that's most of the country.  Where Greenspun and I live seems to be the exception, not the rule and his calculations are based on data that doesn't apply to most people.  It applies to him and it applies to me based on where we live, but it probably isn't something that one should generalize to the country.",1305388303

I live in my basement. I know, I know. That sounds stupid. I have a basement that is the size of all but the largest apartment I've rented and it is where my sweet home theater is as well as my home office (I telecommute). Since it's where I spend so much time, I threw a sofa and a futon and an <i>enormous</i> bean bag down there (and a fridge and microwave). Now, I never even go to the top floor where the bedrooms are.<p>I could rent out all the bedrooms, including the master bedroom (with its own bathroom). I don't even know what the right price would be and I've heard plenty of horror stories about renting to people, but if I renteded even two of the rooms at only $350/mo, I'd have two thirds of my housing costs covered!<p>And, if I ever need to move, I could buy a house somewhere else and keep this one to rent it out. Again, I hear being a landlord sucks - but I have a handyman nearby who could do on-site work for me and once the house is paid off, the renters would basically be paying the mortgage on my <i>second</i> home.<p>Also, I plan to pay down the principal, too. I'm not making any extra payments just yet, but I am putting money in a savings account. If I have an emergency, I have access to that money today. If I don't have an emergency, then once I have enough saved up, I can pay off a hell of a lot of my house at once.<p>Owning a home can be a hassle.

Neither do most.<p>Of course, they have dismissed everything in this article, so the only thing left is for the government to require every internet user to use their real identity online and then have a single discussion/forum/conversation system that all runs on the same API (or have a standard API that ties together very different discussion/forum/conversation systems). Then, you will have no choice but to post as your real world identity and every comment you ever leave anywhere on the internet will be part of that identity and you will be rated on that identity, always. A truly unpleasant idea and I would rather put up with having to ignore the dregs of the internet versus losing the option of anonymity. Of course, people who live their lives in public often have a different view than this, since their personal desire is to get their own identity out there. Not everyone has that same goal or desire.<p>(I won't even bring up my distinct hatred of things like Disqus and Facebook whatchamacallit that sites implement instead of drawing up their own conversation tools).",1305387653

Even if you don't consider the simplicity of being able to pack up and move, or conveniences like garbage collection and maintenance staff (I haven't picked up a snow shovel in two years), you have to account for closing costs for buying and selling as well as the limited equity you will have after only 5 years.  As little as 30% of early mortgage payments go towards principal, the rest is paid to interest.<p>My bank has a financial calculator ""should I rent or buy"" and if I plug in $1700/mo rent (+3%/yr), $350,000 home with 0% appreciation and %1.25 property tax, and leaving all defaults for closing costs on buying and selling, the calculator suggests I will actually save about $12,000 by renting.<p>A quick summary of the details suggests that mortgage payments will be lower than $1,700, but additional expenses make the average monthly expenditure closer to $2,100, but in the long run tax breaks will recover most of that.  After 5 years without selling, considering only payments and tax breaks, you'll be ahead about $4,000 if you buy.  BUT when you try to sell, and look at the big picture, it's actually going to cost you money, because you have to pay the remaining loan balance in addition to closing costs and related fees.  You only get back $60,000 or so, which isn't even enough to recover the initial downpayment of $75,000 the renter never had to pay (and was able to invest in something else).<p>Obviously it's easy to tweak the numbers either way, but the point should be clear that the simple ""renters have nothing to show for it"" argument doesn't hold water.",1305387144

In fact, when I first moved to Denver, I started looking at homes and decided against it. After all, I didn't plan to live here forever. Only awhile. Next thing I knew, I had been here for five years and spent that whole time giving money to someone else.<p>The cities I listed as having lived in were actually three (I realize that I was unclear about California, where I worked in SF but actually lived in San Jose). I can break it down to under a year in one place and at least six years in each of the other two places. Even there, I actually could have probably found a way to <i>not</i> move, so it wouldn't even have been an issue. (I've had the same employer for almost fifteen years).<p>So, in my case, it was only a perceived need for mobility and unwillingness to say ""I'm here, for a long time"" that kept me from owning a home and it was probably not the best financial decision, looking back. I sacrificed a lot of income over the years for something I thought I needed, but never did.<p>It is definitely a bigger concern, now, than ever before. I absolutely concede that point. My grandfather built his home and lived there for more than fifty years. I will be happy if I keep my home for ten or fifteen. Our lives and careers change too often, now. Buying a home now requires the added consideration of whether you'll still be here in five or ten years and how many times (especially in technology) has taking a new job also required moving? (By the way, I think they say it tends to require about five years of ownership to compensate for the costs of buying and selling a house - and that was back when houses were increasing in prices, instead of decreasing).<p>Of course, if home prices reached a naturally lower point instead of being artificially kept up, then the affordability may trump all the other concerns.

Obviously whether this is too high or too low depends entirely on where they live, but again I'm assuming that they were getting a similar place for roughly $1700/mo in rent, and are comfortable in that lifestyle. That's also assuming they have the cash for a down payment ($65k if they want to put 20% down).<p>So, if you run the mortgage numbers, in 5 years, assuming interest rates stay at 4%, they will have paid $61k in interest. Property taxes over 5 years (where I live, anyway) on a $385k home would be $15k-$20k on top of that. If we factor property tax into the $1700/mo, then they can only afford a $265k loan, and only pay $50k in interest over 5 years.<p>Either way, $50k or more interest + $18k in property tax + $50k in depreciation + $15k in closing and real estate fees costs them a lot more than renting for the same time period, and that's assuming that nothing goes wrong. If their roof starts leaking, the deck collapses, they need to move for work or their growing family in less than five years, they are in an even worse situation. (One might suggest we should amortize the $15k in closing and real estate costs over the 5 years and buy a smaller place accordingly, but at that point your $1700/mo rent becomes more like $1150/mo in mortgage payments, so at that point the question becomes how out of whack the renting and buying markets are, assuming again that you want to maintain a similar living standard, and not be downsizing as you're turning 30.)<p>The obvious question then is how likely ""even if your house will depreciate $50k"" ends up being.",1305386481

Unfortunately, I don't know how much more they're going to drop. There is a lot of artificially maintaining the value of homes, because politicians want to keep the voting block happy (people in debt with a family).

Prices should drop to whatever their natural un-aided point would be, so that all those people out there who will either <i>never</i> own a home or only do so by getting into unfathomable debt (all over again) will actually be able to own a piece.

It would transform the economy as well as, perhaps, society. Owning a home would be the rule, instead of exception. Being in debt to own a home would be an exception. High rent would be an exception.

The SCOtutor apps are really well put together and great tutorials.<p>Rather than moan about Apple lets look at what he can do.<p>The author has a collection of extremely high quality content. He's already taken the effort to turn this into chapters. With a bit more effort he should be able to turn this into a pretty good site. If you look at his actual site[1] you'll see he already has this. But lets put some patio11 thinking onto this.<p>He has a lot of chaptered content that would be really useful to new users. So for each class of content he could create a new site, have a couple of chapters available and the rest behind a paywall, charging per chapter or for the whole thing. He can monetize the content with adverts (for the open areas) and Youtube's partner program. Personally if I were him I'd upload my open videos to Vimeo which provides better quality (IMHO, I could be wrong) and to YouTube and monetize the Youtube content (along with links to his specific websites for further tutorials).<p>He can further monetize by using affiliate links from organisations such as Amazon for accessories for the things he's talking about. For example, a video on how to turn smart cover support on and off could be augmented with an affiliate link in the page to smart covers sold on Amazon. It doesn't have to be spammy or overdone.<p>New versions of iOS and OS X come out on a fairly regular basis. He knows the release dates in advance. As the new release date gets closer he can open up more of the older chapters as he sees fit and then release the new course when the new version comes out.<p>Finally the author might want to look at bundle deal sites. There's tons of them for Mac and the most popular ones tend to get around. If he can get his tutors bundled with something that people would buy on it's own then he's more likely to see more sales.<p>[1] - www.screencastsonline.com",1344700777

Why? I am not sure, but probably there are some contractual reasons (e.g. the studios give content only if Apple keeps small fish at bay?). It's certainly not different for songs. I have an album on iTunes and it got there through a major. Three other independent albums were never accepted.<p>Also, while Apple may <i>tolerate</i>, or <i>pretend not to see</i> video hiding in the app store in order to be friendly to developers whilst stretching, bending but not breaking any contractual obligation they probably have, this doesn't mean that they won't stomp such content <i>if and when</i> it's found.

On the second bite however you can now chose between the base of your newly cleared patch which is literally the ""low hanging fruit"" (spiral approach) or move directly along and open up a new row (row approach).<p>The base of your open patch offers good purchase for your upper teeth, high visibility of any oddities that may be lying under the surface and a good understanding of how much you're going to be able to expect from the next bite based on what you just had.  Should you find that the cob is too much for you, you can also chop the remainder off, wrap it in clingfilm and keep it for later (or feasibly offer it to another diner).<p>A row approach means opening up the whole cob in one go. It's hard work at the start and you're fully committed. If you give up half way through you can't really offer your corn to anyone else or bag it for later - it's basically a mess.

4370268,comment,4368993,4368993,4,0,peterwwillis,,,"My preference for a ""next generation pipe"": Shared file descriptors. (Sort of)<p>It would work virtually the same as a standard pipe; the difference being you could control whether it was read, write, or both, and every application you 'piped' to would have access to the same file descriptors as the parent, unless a process in the path of the pipe closes one.<p>The end result will be the equivalent of passing unlimited individual arbitrary bitstreams combined with the ability to chain arbitrary programs. In fact, you could simplify things by simply passing the previous piped command's output as a new file descriptor to the next program, so you could easily reference the last piped program's output, or any of the ones before it.<p>For example:<p><i>cat arbitrary_data.docx | docx --count-words <$S[0] | docx --head 4 <$S[0] | docx --tail 4 <$S[0] | docx --count-words <$S[2] | echo -en ""Number of words: $STREAM[1]\n\nFirst paragraph: $STREAM[2]\n\nLast paragraph: $STREAM[3]\n\nNumber of words in first paragraph: $STREAM[4]\n""</i><p>STREAM[0] is the output of 'cat'. STREAM[1] is the counted words of STREAM[0] ($S[0] is an alias). STREAM[2] is the first 4 lines of the doc. STREAM[3] is the last 4 lines of the doc. STREAM[4] is the counted words from STREAM[2] (note the <i>""<$S[2]""</i>). And STREAM[5] is the output of 'echo', though since it's the last command, it becomes STDOUT.<p>There may be a more slick way of doing this, but you can see the idea. Pass arbitrary streams as you pipe, and reference any of them at any point in the pipe to continue processing data arbitrarily in a one-liner.<p>...<p>Actually, it looks like this is already built into bash (sort of), as the <i>Coprocesses</i> functionality.

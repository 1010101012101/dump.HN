Having a child is <i>both</i> the parents accepting a responsibility to provide for the child in the future, regardless of whether they stay together.<p>Obviously, the child support should be formed in such a way that as long as the children lives with both parents (either because they are together or because the child lives 50/50 in separate locations), there is no need for transfer of funds. If one parent wants to (or is forced to, e.g. after abuse) give up caring for the children (so the child lives e.g. 100% with the mother and 0% with the father) only <i>then</i> should that parent have to pay for child support.<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether that is the way child support works in the US but it&#x27;s pretty much the only reasonable way I can imagine.",1439499566

10057175,comment,10055521,10055521,0,0,svieira,,,"I like the general thrust of PEP 498 (`f&quot;&quot;` is explicit, unlike Ruby or Bash&#x27;s magic `&quot;` vs. `&#x27;`).<p>That said, I think it would be much improved if it went the way of Scala and JavaScript (2015+) and made `r`, `u`, `b`, and `f` all interpolation providers.  That way libraries could provide interpolators without having to extend the language to create a new one.<p>For example, in Scala or JavaScript, you can create a string context / template tag for composing JSON strings, resulting in a nice syntax like this (scala-like):<p><pre><code>    json&quot;&quot;&quot;{\n      &quot;my&quot;: $data,\n      &quot;anArray&quot;: $someArray\n    }&quot;&quot;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThe `data` and `someArray` values serialized to JSON by the `json` interpolation provider.<p>At that point, internationalization is just creating your own interpolation provider and importing it as `i`, which is far less machinery than this PEP requires.",1439499540

10057167,comment,10055134,10056232,0,0,Loughla,,,"Sorry for how long this turned out to be.\nI believe the massive number of vets returning from places like Afghanistan and Iraq has had quite a bit to do with the increased tensions between civilians and police as well, and has also contributed to the militarization of police across the country (at least in attitude, if not in equipment).<p>Couple a newly returned squad of soldiers who are more than qualified for civilian law-enforcement with a new incoming supply of armored transport and military equipment, you can&#x27;t avoid the militarization of the police force.<p>As anecdotal evidence; in my small area of the mid-west, our local county police force (I&#x27;m ignoring the state and city cops for now) is comprised of roughly 50 officers. Without the jail and office-dwellers, it&#x27;s about 35 who are on the street daily.<p>After looking it up, of those 35, 32 have less than 10 years&#x27; experience. Of those 32, all were hired within 3 months of returning from Afghanistan or Iraq.<p>I never put two and two together. I just noticed that the attitude in the county has changed.<p>Whereas people used to talk to the police they met, and used to interact with them at community events, they don&#x27;t anymore (and the cops don&#x27;t come to church socials, community gatherings or celebrations anymore - they only stick with each other). In the past, I have actually invited officers to the house for lemonade, or even delivered it to them, when I saw them sitting at the nearest speed trap spot on hot days. I&#x27;ve jumped their cars when they die. I&#x27;ve even invited them to (illegal) fireworks displays - with no worries, because they understood that we weren&#x27;t idiots.<p>I haven&#x27;t done any of that for over five years.<p>Why?<p>Because all the police now treat their police work like an extension of their time in the military. All of them. Every one. Legitimately, they stick together like it&#x27;s still the military, and always have their fingers on the trigger of whatever gun they&#x27;re carrying when speaking to anyone who isn&#x27;t in a county officer uniform.<p>They&#x27;re driving around with multiple firearms in rural areas where the crime rate is non-existent. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know where my house keys are because I have never locked the doors.<p>In 8 years.<p>But, they&#x27;ve become, essentially, a little military. They practice swat tactics, they practice distance shooting, they practice how to take down dangerous criminals that don&#x27;t exist in our area.<p>Why? What does that help? They should be practicing how to talk to children without needing to touch a gun, and how to interact with adults without treating them like criminals.<p>tl;dr: returning vets who refuse to lose the military attitude, increased military supplies to civilian law enforcement agencies, and the shit-tons of money to be made in corrections have all contributed to this problem of hyper-vigilance.",1439499491

This inflates the demand for rentals thus raising their price.<p>The group with capital/access to loans can buy real estate with the express purpose of renting it taking homes off the market (decreasing supply, raising prices and further pushing up the bar for home ownership). This is even more attractive because of the increased demand and price for rental units. Of course by increasing the supply of rental units this should counteract rental prices but under the current circumstances I think there&#x27;s a feedback loop that favors rising rental prices and entering/expanding the landlord business.",1439499366

10057108,comment,10056033,10056960,0,0,mmastrac,,,"My point is mainly that Parse is antithetical to good developer practices that include 1) multiple environments 2) fully automated deployment operations in every way, and 3) testing.<p>- &quot;Maintaining compatibility with a long tail of old, stale versions of your clients in the field is something all of us need to deal with as app developers. Our examples do place more emphasis on client-originated object updates and queries due to our approach of making it very easy for developers to get started. Some of our more sophisticated developers end up using the approach you&#x27;ve used as an example of moving as much of the operations over to Cloud Code. This is, in fact, one of the reasons we decided to work on our Cloud Code server-side compute environment.&quot;<p>The problem is that Parse does not offer an &quot;afterRead&quot; hook, so if you offer a field and a client consumes it, you must continue to offer that field until that client no longer exists. When writing traditional server APIs, I can synthesize a field for older clients during read options. With Parse, not so. Parse clients old and new read the same, raw table no matter what -- this is where I feel Parse fundamentally fails.<p>- &quot;A beforeSave, by definition, will block a save until the operation has finished. Save operations on the client side are performed asynchronously, so this should generally not block your app. An afterSave can be used for things such as sending an email through Mailchimp, which in general you would not block a user operation on, but rather these would be queued up. There are some sensible default timeouts in place to discourage lengthy operations that could lead to a unsatisfying user experience (e.g. creating a new row should not take more than 3 seconds). If you are OK with having the user wait more than 3 seconds, you can use Webhooks to redirect the beforeSave/afterSave/cloud-function computation to a third party server of your choosing. In that case, you would have up to 30 seconds to return a response to the client.&quot;<p>If it is the case that afterSave does not block a save, then the documentation is pretty poor around this. My understanding is that afterSave and beforeSave are both required to complete before you&#x27;ll get a return value from saving an object. If this is not the case, I suggest making this clearer in the docs.<p>- &quot;This is a big pain point many of our users have highlighted. Cloud Code is not node, so the best way to test code is by running it on Cloud Code itself. We do not have a good solution for satisfying this need at this time, so I would suggest using node.js on a third party server and taking advantage of Webhooks. This effectively allows you to Bring Your Own Server and provides you with limitless flexibility on what can be done as part of a save hook or cloud function call.&quot;<p>At the point where you are using Webhooks like this, the advantages of Parse disappear entirely. You can get far more flexibility from setting up a node.js server that hits MongoLab (or some other hosted Mongo). Honestly I feel that it is absolutely _wrong_ for your DB to block on a backend server dealing with app logic. This is an inverted version of what your design should look like.<p>- &quot;I think that everything you can do on Parse should have a REST API equivalent. We&#x27;ve recently launched a Hooks API as well as a Schema API. Perhaps a Config API can be considered. I personally use Config to store credentials that I would not want to be checked in to version control, and I use Parse Objects for anything that changes often enough to require programmatic updates.&quot;<p>If there&#x27;s a way to set Parse.Config via REST (maybe there&#x27;s an undocumented PUT?), it is not documented anywhere on the site. Since Parse.Config is public data to anyone using my app, I would certainly avoid putting credentials in there.<p>- &quot;You can clone an app and its entire schema from your Settings. This is the best way to ensure there is a 1 to 1 mapping between prod and staging. One thing that is missing from this is cloning data from prod to staging. Bigger apps, with gigabytes of data, could take a very long time to clone. In this case, I would suggest having some sort of seed script that populates your staging database with placeholder data. I understand this does not solve the problem of having an exact copy of your production database, but this is not a simple problem to solve (would you want to keep both apps in sync as the prod app gets updated? would you be willing to wait hours/days for your an initial sync from prod to staging?). With that said, this is something we&#x27;re aware of and hope to be able to address soon. Stay tuned.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not cloning a DB that&#x27;s the problem -- it&#x27;s programatically updating schema so that I can deploy schema changes to my staging environment and then deploy the matching set of schema changes to prod environment, automatically. This is not possible without a bunch of scripting. And, obviously, there is no easy way to mass-migrate parse objects to a new schema either.<p>- &quot;Mucking with JSON to successfully create a valid pointer sounds like an easy way to introduce bugs in your code. You shouldn&#x27;t need to to do this, use YourClass.createWithoutData(objectId) instead.&quot;<p>This needs to be better documented. Google searches bring up results where people are constructing pointers via JSON and this was indicated to be &quot;the right way to do things&quot;. I don&#x27;t have a reference off-hand to the post where this was mentioned, but it is definitely there.<p>- &quot;createdAt and updatedAt are automatic fields set by the underlying mongo database, and you can depend on these being accurate as no user or admin operation can force them to use arbitrary values. You&#x27;re definitely welcome to create your own Date fields if your use case requires arbitrary values. This shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a burden, IMHO.&quot;<p>But when you combine the fact that I&#x27;ve got apps out in the field looking at updatedAt instead of my new field this becomes a very large burden. If I want to mass-import data into my system, I&#x27;m at the mercy of system timestamps. There are no options to fix this. These fields absolutely _should_ be under control of the admin, at least. If I have the master key, why not let me change it?",1439498878

A bond is a guarantee provided by a third party, the bondsman, that you will appear in court. It is usually some fraction of your actual bail, like 10%. So if we assume 10% and $3,000 paid to the bondsman, then his bail was probably $30,000.

10057005,comment,10054484,10054484,0,0,todd8,,,"Around 1966, two notable programming languages were developed around the notion of macro expansion. One of these was Christopher Strachey&#x27;s GPM (General Purpose Macrogenerator) and Calvin Moore&#x27;s Trac(tm) system. GPM, perhaps because of Strachey&#x27;s academic reputation (he taught at Oxford and is well known for <i>denotational semantics</i>), seems to have had a greater influence in Computer Science.<p>Trac(tm), on the other hand, had an important booster, it was promoted in Ted Nelson&#x27;s 1974 cult classic <i>Computer Lib</i>, one of my treasured historical CS books that I bought in grad school the first time around. Nelson (famous for inventing hypertext, the notion of embedded active links decades before HTML) wrote that &quot;You can and must understand computers now.&quot; He suggested learning three languages: BASIC, TRAC, and APL--all languages that he felt you could learn on your own. Trac, and the remarkably similar GPM, are very simple. I&#x27;ve implemented Trac-like systems several times. It&#x27;s a fun project to implement in an afternoon when learning a new programming language.<p>What made these two languages interesting is that they are equivalent to a Turing machine and hence capable of arbitrary computations. Furthermore, they really aren&#x27;t impractical to use (but see my comments below). If locked in a dungeon by an evil genie and forced to write a real program on bare hardware before I could be released, I would certainly consider developing TRAC or GPM as the first step (or maybe FORTH).<p>m4, developed by Kernighan and Ritchie in 1977, looks like it was inspired by GPM. It&#x27;s been a useful tool for me a number of times, but it is good to not let it&#x27;s generality and flexibility suck you into outsmarting yourself.<p>The power of these macro systems (and TeX&#x27;s as well) comes from the arbitrary rewriting that they enable, a bit like Chompsky&#x27;s Type 0 (unrestricted) grammars in his hierarchy. These macro systems, once popular, have now fallen out of favor. Although almost trivial to implement, programming in them is a bit like playing Othello, it&#x27;s hard to see very far ahead: what will unfold when a macro that will be expanded is passed arguments that will be re-expanded.<p>Sendmail&#x27;s configuration files are processed by m4--seemed like a cool idea in the early 1980&#x27;s--but that made it hard for non-experts to understand what was happening.",1439497755

Enough to cloud the market for games created by any future indie dev.<p>Advice is plentiful, though you do have a lack of great sources to ask questions.<p>IMO, devs starting with unity are almost drowned in advanced features to get started from concept to prototype. Easy to learn, hard to master, easier to edit store bought prefabs than to DIY. They can become a crutch very quickly.<p>The unity store can be a boon and a roadblock to progress, because it doesn&#x27;t always help.

Once the code is in place, debug/playtesting is critical to developing assets that then can be designed, built as mesh, and imported within the prototype in a few seconds.<p>Character controllers are generally easy,  more dynamic mechanim is able to avoid some pitfalls of the capsule collision system, and there are ways to add crouch/jump use cases with pathfinding and AI,(which is a good bit of work.)<p>Unity does excel at getting a walking mesh going, using mechanim to blend animation and mesh collision, and 3d art assets designed in Maya or 3dsmax, etc.<p>When I started with unity in 2012, it took forever to even think about how to build a menu system, until NGUI.

I&#x27;ve probably seen every question related to Parse, spend most days supporting apps with millions of users, and hopefully I can address some of these.<p>You bring up some valid points, some specific to Parse, others related to backend systems in general.<p>- &quot;The real problems show up when you&#x27;ve all of a sudden got these old apps out in the field with no way to upgrade them to a newer version of the DB. If you aren&#x27;t being diligent and making all your Parse DB calls through their cloud functions, you are guaranteed to end up in a situation where your older mobile clients are holding back schema and feature evolution.&quot;<p>Maintaining compatibility with a long tail of old, stale versions of your clients in the field is something all of us need to deal with as app developers. Our examples do place more emphasis on client-originated object updates and queries due to our approach of making it very easy for developers to get started. Some of our more sophisticated developers end up using the approach you&#x27;ve used as an example of moving as much of the operations over to Cloud Code. This is, in fact, one of the reasons we decided to work on our Cloud Code server-side compute environment.<p>- &quot;beforeSave/afterSave triggers are completely unusable! They are unbelievably limited and each one you add slows your app down by as much time as it takes to run. If you want to do something like add users to Mailchimp, you have now tied the length of time it takes to save a user to the length of time it takes to talk to mailchimp!&quot;<p>A beforeSave, by definition, will block a save until the operation has finished. Save operations on the client side are performed asynchronously, so this should generally not block your app. An afterSave can be used for things such as sending an email through Mailchimp, which in general you would not block a user operation on, but rather these would be queued up. There are some sensible default timeouts in place to discourage lengthy operations that could lead to a unsatisfying user experience (e.g. creating a new row should not take more than 3 seconds). If you are OK with having the user wait more than 3 seconds, you can use Webhooks to redirect the beforeSave/afterSave/cloud-function computation to a third party server of your choosing. In that case, you would have up to 30 seconds to return a response to the client.<p>- &quot;There is absolutely no way to test your parse code other than uploading it to a parse app and hitting it. You can hack together some node code that sort-of tests it, but it&#x27;s nowhere near representative of what happens on the server.&quot;<p>This is a big pain point many of our users have highlighted. Cloud Code is not node, so the best way to test code is by running it on Cloud Code itself. We do not have a good solution for satisfying this need at this time, so I would suggest using node.js on a third party server and taking advantage of Webhooks. This effectively allows you to Bring Your Own Server and provides you with limitless flexibility on what can be done as part of a save hook or cloud function call.<p>- &quot;You can&#x27;t manage Parse.Config programatically. There&#x27;s a web interface and that&#x27;s that. None of your config can live in your git repo because there&#x27;s no way to read or write it from the command-line.&quot;<p>I think that everything you can do on Parse should have a REST API equivalent. We&#x27;ve recently launched a Hooks API as well as a Schema API. Perhaps a Config API can be considered. I personally use Config to store credentials that I would not want to be checked in to version control, and I use Parse Objects for anything that changes often enough to require programmatic updates.<p>- &quot;The schema tools are pretty bad on the website. IIRC they introduced REST APIs to make changes to schema recently, but unless you plan on writing tooling around those, you&#x27;ll be manually syncing schema between prod/staging at some point in your life and you&#x27;ll probably also miss a critical column that got added.&quot;<p>You can clone an app and its entire schema from your Settings. This is the best way to ensure there is a 1 to 1 mapping between prod and staging. One thing that is missing from this is cloning data from prod to staging. Bigger apps, with gigabytes of data, could take a very long time to clone. In this case, I would suggest having some sort of seed script that populates your staging database with placeholder data. I understand this does not solve the problem of having an exact copy of your production database, but this is not a simple problem to solve (would you want to keep both apps in sync as the prod app gets updated? would you be willing to wait hours/days for your an initial sync from prod to staging?). With that said, this is something we&#x27;re aware of and hope to be able to address soon. Stay tuned.<p>- &quot;Parse has a bunch of weird datatypes that act strangely in their cloud code. Want to make a pointer and store it in a parse field? Construct its internal representation and set it! I wish I was kidding. If you construct a pointer incorrectly, it can actually create a phantom object in another table. Also wish I was kidding about this.&quot;<p>Mucking with JSON to successfully create a valid pointer sounds like an easy way to introduce bugs in your code. You shouldn&#x27;t need to to do this, use YourClass.createWithoutData(objectId) instead.[1]<p>- &quot;createdAt and updatedAt are special and Parse won&#x27;t let you touch them or set them. Heaven forbid you want to actually set these to a meaningful time other than the actual last time the record was written. Nope. So you end up making your own updatedAt columns and just using those.&quot;<p>createdAt and updatedAt are automatic fields set by the underlying mongo database, and you can depend on these being accurate as no user or admin operation can force them to use arbitrary values. You&#x27;re definitely welcome to create your own Date fields if your use case requires arbitrary values. This shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a burden, IMHO.<p>Hopefully this helps!

Go&#x27;s for has four versions (by my count):<p><pre><code>    1. for x := range y {...}, value iteration\n    2. for init; cond; post {...}, the traditional 3-element for loop\n    3. for cond {...}, which is basically the while loop\n    4. for {...}, &quot;loop forever&quot;\n</code></pre>\nthe latter being something that is actually used with some frequency by server-like goroutines.<p>In Python, that&#x27;s:<p><pre><code>    1. for x in y\n    2. actually a bit of a pain, but for i, x in range(y) + break\n       usually covers it. (Go has break too, of course.)\n    3. while cond:\n    4. while True\n</code></pre>\nNet-net, if Python wins, it&#x27;s not by much. I will give it points for making value iteration the simpler, visibly-obvious preferred alternative.<p>In the <i>general</i> &quot;syntax to inhale&quot;, I gotta say Python is the clear loser. It&#x27;s the clear loser due to being a featureful language that has evolved a lot over the decades, in a way that is generally to its advantage, but in this particular context, no, it&#x27;s no contest. Python has <i>way</i> more syntax than Go. It is <i>way</i> easier to write idiomatic Python code that someone with 4 weeks of experience in Python will look at and not even know where to start searching the manual to find out what just happened (generator comprehensions in particular can be really sneaky). Go could be covered in its syntactic entirity in a well-paced high school semester.<p>I&#x27;m personally a bit ambivalent here. Python has been my goto recommendation for &quot;teach new people with this&quot; language for a good long time, but I am forced to admit that Go is potentially at least competitive, with the right resources created for it. It&#x27;s a really different spin on the newbie experience, but it has a certain appeal. I&#x27;d probably stick with Python until those resources appear, though.",1439496912

They are not taxed proportionally to their ability to pay, or the degree to which they enjoy the benefits of a well-funded government, but proportionally to their ignorance of the tax code.  They know it well, so they pay relatively little in taxes.  They are acting appropriately in the interests of their business in light of the circumstances they face.  It isn&#x27;t GE&#x27;s fault that they can legally pay so little.  Nor should we shame them for doing so.  They are merely an illustrative example that the US corporate tax code is broken beyond any reasonable expectation of repair.<p>The &quot;fair share&quot; of taxes is zero.  All taxation is inherently unfair, as a violation of one&#x27;s right to property.  The unfairness is [sometimes] justified by spending the tax revenue upon preservation of the commons and projects that serve the common good.  But collection is more often motivated by whether it can be done rather than whether it should be done.  There is no absolutely fair way to levy a tax, but some taxes are still more unfair than others.<p>Taxation is not <i>necessarily</i> similar to punishment.  It is merely an economic discouragement, with an unavoidable deadweight loss from economic distortion.  The net effect is largely the same.  People avoid doing the thing that triggers the tax, because the tax makes it more costly or less beneficial.<p>Income taxes and sales taxes punish useful commerce.  Property taxes punish land improvements.  Liquor taxes punish recreational drug use.  Poll taxes punish being black in the South.  Congestion taxes punish driving downtown at the wrong time.  Recreation taxes punish having fun in Chicago.  Hotel room taxes punish tourism.<p>So what behaviors would <i>everyone</i> want to discourage by levying a tax?

The hitman technically did not commit murder because when he shot the victim, he intended to kill him but did not actually succeed.  However, when he did finally kill the victim (by leaving him out to die of exposure), he had no intention of killing the victim (because the hitman thought the victim was already dead).<p>Of course, this is all theoretical and if you did try to pull off a crime by manipulating mens and actus rea, you would find prosecutors very creative in finding ways to throw the book at you.",1439496740

A difference coworker had encountered some issues with a batch which had a defective lubricant causing the surface to break down over a couple years.<p>One place we worked with had to carefully de-tune a new tape drive after learning that the old one had drifted out of alignment for at least a year before physically failing, which meant that most of their tapes were no longer readable by a drive in standard calibration.<p>This is not to say that tape doesn&#x27;t have a place - analogous failures happen for everything else and the cost-per-GB is appealing. I just don&#x27;t think we actually have a toss-in-on-the-shelf storage media which can be assumed to work over a long term. You can address those issues with a regimented approach for rotation and mixing physical devices, media, and location but that increases the cost of adding a new storage technology into the mix since you need to develop that operational confidence for each class.",1439496718

10056887,comment,10055134,10056421,0,0,Tenhundfeld,,,"If you&#x27;re considering this, read up on the law, and ideally, get advice from a lawyer who knows the laws and precedents of your state and local judges. It&#x27;s a trickier subject than you might expect.<p>I got called to serve jury duty several years ago, and being somewhat familiar with jury nullification, sought advice from a lawyer friend.<p>I don&#x27;t remember the exact details of his advice, but it was generally this:<p>1) Don&#x27;t even hint that you&#x27;re aware of jury nullification during jury selection and examination.<p>Obviously don&#x27;t lie if asked a direct question about it, but that doesn&#x27;t really happen. Instead, you might be asked something like, &quot;If the evidence proves the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, can you enforce the law regardless of your personal beliefs about whether the law is correct?&quot; Just answer &quot;yes&quot; and be quiet – unless you honestly don&#x27;t think so. (Remember, you won&#x27;t know much, if anything, about the case at this point. So, abstractly, you probably <i>can</i> set aside personal beliefs if the facts of the case warrant it.)<p>2) Don&#x27;t ever use the words &quot;jury nullification&quot; when deliberating with the other jurors.<p>Judges can and will remove jurors who are openly engaging in jury nullification. There have even been instances of judges holding jurors in contempt for it, but according to my lawyer friend, those cases were overturned. Regardless, you will likely be removed from the jury and possibly have further hassles.<p>3) In jury deliberation, remember that you don&#x27;t <i>have to</i> convince the other jurors of your position. If you don&#x27;t feel right convicting the defendant, you don&#x27;t have to. Just stick to your guns and let the jury be hung.<p>I was glad I sought advice, because I ended up engaging in jury nullification.<p>In my case, the defendant was charged with a DUI for essentially being obnoxiously drunk in his driveway on private property. He was playing music through his truck speakers, with the windows down. The engine was not on, but his keys were in the ignition – to enable the electrical system. He was having a party, with friends over, a grill going, etc. He had not signaled any intent to leave the party at his own home, and the prosecution didn&#x27;t argue that he was planning to drive anywhere. But in my state, being intoxicated and having your keys in the ignition (or even initiating a sequence of events that will result in driving) is grounds for a DUI.<p>I understand the reasons for the law being worded that way. If somebody is obviously drunk and walking towards their car to leave a bar, cops need to be able to stop him before he actually starts driving. However, in my case, what actually happened is the defendant mouthed off to the cops, and my interpretation is they were punishing him for being disrespectful. They could have just told him to turn down his music or issued him a noise violation and moved on. He was not planning to drive his car anywhere or endanger anyone. Instead, they unnecessarily escalated the situation.<p>A DUI can be a felony and can result in losing your job or being excluded from future jobs. It&#x27;s serious. I didn&#x27;t think this guy deserved that – despite coming across as a total asshole during his testimony. I tried my best to convince the other jurors, but they all ultimately felt they had to enforce the law as it exists. According to the law, he did commit acts that technically constitute a DUI. So, they all voted guilty – even though many thought it &quot;wasn&#x27;t fair.&quot;<p>After 8 hours of deliberation, we ended up with a hung jury and me being the sole dissenter. I will admit it was exhausting to keep arguing for the guy, when everybody is tired and just wants to go home. I was also very relieved when I went home that night, searched public convictions, and found none for the defendant.<p>Anyway, if you get called to serve on a jury, please don&#x27;t try to get out of it. It&#x27;s a great honor and responsibility, and we need more intelligent, free-thinking people in our juries. But do educate yourself on jury nullification beforehand.",1439496636

The reorganization is designed to provide shareholders with a cleaner, more transparent structure while giving Google the ability to more easily operate its various businesses independently. If one of Alphabet&#x27;s independent companies takes off, the structure could also make it easier for it to engage in transactions that reward Alphabet shareholders.<p>When you invest in a new venture fund, you&#x27;re not buying anything at book value. You&#x27;re providing capital and trusting that the folks who are going to deploy it will be able to achieve a return consistent with your goals. Most funds charge an annual fee of 2% of assets under management and investors are locked in for at least 10 years, so there&#x27;s no free lunch. Given that the multiples in the private market today are even more pronounced than in the public markets, investors in venture funds are effectively paying significant premiums too.<p>Bottom line: if you like the core Google business and want some exposure to the craziest ideas in Silicon Valley, Alphabet might be attractive.

Do GoogleMaps, Runkeeper, etc...? No, of course not. Their value proposition is clear.<p>Conclusions: Users aren&#x27;t aware and probably don&#x27;t care enough in mass to deny implicit location collection. The subtext is there&#x27;s only a potential backlash if you don&#x27;t provide sufficient value; Facebook can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to provide that value so they removed it.",1439496043

The only safe option is to assume that any patient data that exists on a Windows 10 system is unsecured unless that system is entirely disconnected from any kind of network or until Windows 10 is significantly more transparent about what it&#x27;s doing behind users&#x27; backs.<p>Of course, this is speculation right now, and perhaps my concerns are unfounded, but I can already imagine some old doctor typing &quot;J. Random Hacker biopsy&quot; into that Start Menu search field in the hopes of finding some document and inadvertently sending the fact that J. Random Hacker had a biopsy to Microsoft and potentially some advertising partners (depending on the nature of such transmissions).",1439496031

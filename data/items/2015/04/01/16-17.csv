9305048,comment,9301054,9302435,0,0,KMag,,,"> I&#x27;m all for building fault tolerant systems, but the database being available ...<p>&quot;the database&quot;?  Sure, if you&#x27;ve ruled out building systems that split state across multiple databases, filesystems, etc.  However, what if you (for instance) want to isolate the user login system from the purchasing system, so that if someone discovers a DoS exploit against your login DB, users who are already logged in can still use your website and make purchases against your orders DB?<p>I ran into something similar back around 2005-6.  My employer had a big problem with credit card thieves buying our inexpensive product in order to filter canceled CCs from usable CCs.  All of the recommended open-source CAPTCHAs at the time expected that the code creating the CAPTCHA image and the code verifying the user&#x27;s answer shared a filesystem and/or a database.  For security reasons, our CC-processing machine was a bare minimum machine with bare minimum interface to the outside world.<p>So, what I did was make a security token that was tok = HMAC( key0, Concat( timestamp | 0x3F, ipv4addr | 0xFF ) ) ] .  I then used seed = HMAC( key1, tok ) to seed a 31-bit linear feedback shift register that was used first to generate several base32 characters and then used to generate the positions of those characters and the psudorandom distortions of the CAPTCHA image.   The main webserver then just created a form with hidden fields for tok and timestamp (plus all of the payment information) that made an HTTPS POST to the payment webserver.  That way, each IP address would only get a new CAPTCHA every 32 seconds (so they couldn&#x27;t just hammer us until we gave them some easy pseudorandom distortions), we had a verified timestamp for expiry (so we had a bound on how long we needed to keep successful answers in our anti-replay history), and users wouldn&#x27;t get rejected if their ISP&#x27;s NAT or DHCP setup changed their external IP within the same /24 between getting the CAPTCHA and submitting the purchase.  The only pieces of shared state between the two servers were key0 and key1.<p>This wasn&#x27;t JWT, but it illustrates a real world case where there was a strong need to separate state between two systems and have the client transmit the cryptographically authenticated data between the two systems.<p>As an aside, the system was built incrementally over the course of one evening.  First stage deployment used dummy stub code for the anti-replay history database and sat back and waited for a thief to come along and hit us with a batch of several thousand stolen CCs.  An IP from Virginia hit us a few times a second for a couple minutes with purchase POSTs missing the token and timestamp fields, all with different names and CCNs.  After a pause of a couple of minutes, I started seeing a few successful purchases per second from that IP address, all using the same token and timestamp.  I quickly manually banned that IP address and within 30 seconds saw several rejects per second from an IP address in England trying to use the cryptographic token tied to the /24 in Virginia.  Then the attacker apparently decided it was easier to verify the stolen CCs somewhere else rather than try and OCR our CAPTCHA.",1427907569

9305046,comment,9296431,9301468,0,0,csandreasen,,,"Though I recognize the thread is pretty much over with, I&#x27;ll add on to irishcoffee&#x27;s claim...<p>It&#x27;s very important to understand what Snowden&#x27;s motives in evaluating the validity of the NSA documents.  None of the documents have been released in their entirety, and often times the only thing that is released is a paragraph or two, or perhaps a couple of slides.  Is there enough context in the partial source material presented to back up the article&#x27;s claims, or is there more to the story?  There have been several times when the media released one story, only to be contradicted when they later released further portions of the same document.  For example, see [1], [2] and [3].<p>If he&#x27;s whistleblowing on these program like he claims, there&#x27;s no reason to doubt the validity of the documents; if he&#x27;s just a disgruntled systems administrator with an axe to grind, the documents we see may cut down to remove the context and just show us what he and Greenwald want us to see, knowing full well that the NSA generally can&#x27;t provide evidence denying the claims without releasing more classified information.  When you add things like claims that other writers were forbidden from criticizing or contradicting Greenwald&#x27;s narrative on Snowden at the Guardian[4] and at the Intercept on other subjects[5], it adds to suspicions that we&#x27;re getting a distorted view of the subject.<p>Regarding Snowden&#x27;s grandstanding, you don&#x27;t even need to go all of the way back to high school to start seeing claims that don&#x27;t quite mesh with reality.  He lied about his qualifications to get his initial job as an NSA contractor[6] and by his own admission took the Booz Allen job specifically to gather information to leak[7].  That doesn&#x27;t strike me as whistleblowing - instead of &quot;I saw something wrong and I&#x27;m reporting it&quot; it&#x27;s instead &quot;I&#x27;m determined to find something wrong and report it.&quot;  That alone should sound sirens in everyone&#x27;s head that whatever was released had a skewed perspective to it.<p>He claimed to be a senior intelligence official, while the NSA claims he was a low-level systems administrator.  If we look at his actual words, though, compare for example his description of PRISM in 2013[8] to his description of it in 2014 after all of the details were released[9].  They&#x27;re so different that it&#x27;s apparent to me that he didn&#x27;t actually know any of the details on PRISM beforehand except for general information mixed with his own assumptions.  Other sources have documented a whole litany of other contradictions in his statements ([10] for example).<p>I&#x27;ve seen so many people say not to focus on Snowden, focus on the documents, but you can&#x27;t fully evaluate the context of the documents without knowing his motive.  Is he a heroic whistleblower like he claims, or is he a disgruntled ex-employee trying to lash out at his former employer and gain notoriety in the process through misleading disclosures?<p>[1] <a href=""http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2014/04/what-is-known-about-nsas-prism-program.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2014/04/what-is-known-about...</a> (jump down to section 5, just below the &#x27;PRISM Tasking Process&#x27; slide)<p>[2] <a href=""http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2013/11/screenshots-from-boundlessinformant-can.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2013/11/screenshots-from-bo...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2015/02/snowden-would-not-have-been-able-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2015/02/snowden-would-not-...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2015/03/20/new-editor-for-guardian-newspaper/25094233/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2015/03/...</a> (search for &#x27;verboten&#x27;)<p>[5] <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/02/ken-silverstein-intercept-stifled-serial-reporting-203236.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/02/ken-silverstein-...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/us-usa-security-snowden-idUSBRE95K01J20130621"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/us-usa-security-sn...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268209/snowden-sought-booz-allen-job-gather-evidence-nsa-surveillance?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268209/snowden-s...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/snowden-says-nsa-has-direct-access-to-tech-companies-2013-7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/snowden-says-nsa-has-direct-a...</a> (search for &quot;We&#x27;ve got PRISM&quot;)<p>[9] <a href=""http://blog.ted.com/we-dont-have-to-give-up-liberty-to-have-security-edward-snowden-at-ted2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ted.com/we-dont-have-to-give-up-liberty-to-have-...</a> (search for &quot;The NSA&#x27;s own slides&quot;)<p>[10] <a href=""https://www.beaconreader.com/joshua-foust/the-edward-snowden-snow-job?ref=profile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.beaconreader.com/joshua-foust/the-edward-snowden...</a>",1427907560

Yes, on the very specific airplane that he&#x27;s using a lot of the calculation is already handled by the fms, but it doesn&#x27;t mean the pilot shouldn&#x27;t know about the regulations and workings of his plane, especially for the case where an emergency happens.<p>c) The biggest barrier to self-flying plane is not the perception of safety. It is the reaction in case of emergency. While one could argue that many accidents can be linked to human error, many are also averted by the pilots onboard reacting correctly to an emergency. And the recent history has shown that even with the huge amount of redundancy that exists in planes computers/sensors/automation systems nowadays, it&#x27;s not enough to make the plane entirely safe to fly by its own.<p>Look at AF447, the autopilot disconnected when it couldn&#x27;t understand the discrepencies between its sensors. And while the pilots didn&#x27;t have the good reaction, it was due to their lack of proper flying experience (and reliance on automation).

He painted his own picture to the world, and the people he wronged can&#x27;t set the record straight because of national security concerns.

Before they worked at NSA, the lawyers passed the bar. They took an oath to uphold the law. They wouldn&#x27;t just let people break the law, if for no other reason than, they might get caught. I&#x27;m also pretty sure each DoD entity has an IG department. If someone does something wrong, and gets caught, they get in a lot of trouble.<p>There is a whole series of checks and balances in place. If something is wrong, its the law you have a beef with.<p>And again to answer your question, he leaked what he wanted, painted the picture he wanted, manipulated people to believe whatever he wants them to, knowing he couldn&#x27;t be contradicted. He could literally say whatever he wants at this point and people gobble it up. People believe what they want, based on what he says, without ever pretending to consider the idea of possibly entertaining the idea of giving the DoD the benefit of the doubt.",1427905293

At the learning side, abstraction do feel like just one more layer to penetrate, unless, the abstraction is based on your existing experience, which in current programming culture is not really the case.<p>To understand what I am advocating, think on the writing side, think about when you want to write a program when there is no library and no syntax. What will you have? You&#x27;ll start with abstract word with meanings based on your past experience. And that abstract word will be able to communicate with your fellow as they often share some of your experience. That is what I mean vocabulary based programming. I guess it is the word &quot;abstraction&quot; confuses. I did not use the word &quot;abstraction&quot; although people with experience in learning tend to see abstraction. Think about how you sort a deck of card, does the word such as <i>pick, find, insert</i> appear abstraction to you? They are the first natural units of meaning, and they appear in our head before any detail implementations. So if we refer abstractions as the steps for our mind to get to, then those vocabulary are not abstractions, the actual implementations are. Anyway, I know I am confusing the hell out of even myself -- natural language and how our mind works are strange :). In the end, I would like you to forget about abstraction or even vocabulary, just go to the most natural way of thinking: whatever comes first should come first in writing (code), and often that is how the most natural way to read as well.",1427904675

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and they have no information about the students who are using their software.  On the schools’ side, large districts are spending tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but the challenge of getting 30 kids to log in correctly makes using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after two and a half years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (15M kids), and 35,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:\n-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and\n-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 50 (22 engineers) based in downtown SF.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who like:<p>-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)<p>-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)<p>-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)<p>-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanets<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs#engineer-full-stack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs#engineer-full-stack</a>, or check out what we’re working on at <a href=""https://github.com/clever"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clever</a>.",1427904031

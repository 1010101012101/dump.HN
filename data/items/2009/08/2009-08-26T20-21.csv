787973,comment,787390,787765,0,0,Shooter,,,"""The problem happens when the size of the fund gets too large and there aren't enough deals for the money available."" That's a <i>big</i> problem, though.  And it's just one ugly facet of the overall clusterfork that is the investment management industry.<p>My investment firm has a 5/50 fee schedule, instead of the standard 2/20 that most private equity firms and hedgies use. [The first time I said that to a potential client, they literally tried to <i>run</i> out of my office - but couldn't because they were hyperventilating too much. ;-) ]<p>To explain, we take <i>50%</i> of any <i>outperformance</i> beyond an appropriate benchmark (S&P or DJIA index fund, for example) with a <i>5</i> year lockup.  We charge an early withdrawal fee if the client wants to pull their money during the lockup, but there are no management fees.  We therefore have no incentive to grow our AUM beyond what we can invest wisely.  Problem solved. We also don't have to justify how we're ""incentivized"" out of the corner of our mouth like most firms do, because we only get paid if we <i>out</i>perform.  [FYI: Starving if you fail is an <i>incentive</i> not to fail.  Having to downgrade which luxury sports car you drive because your carry was weak is not.  Declaring bankruptcy if you fail is an <i>incentive</i> not to fail.  Having to postpone your purchase of a luxury vacation home until next year is not.  I personally wouldn't want to pay some bozo for just coasting along with my money - I would want results.  Why should my client's expect less?]<p>I like to say ""5/50 instead of 2/20"" during client presentations, because I like to see the shock and/or outrage on client's faces before I explain everything.  I'm sick that way.  Everyone assumes I mean a 5% management fee and 50% of profits.  Fortunately, no one has had a heart attack before I explain yet.<p>I love performance-based compensation in ALL industries.  Unfortunately, most industries have at least some restrictions on using it...including <i>this</i> one.  The greedy and incompetent always fight to maintain the status quo, and sometimes government 'protections' backfire.",1251317690

It's pretty unlikely that nature would happen to put such large systems as whole proteins in their lowest possible energy configurations when all that is really necessary is that they be stable (ie., locally minimal configurations). Especially if nature uses the tightly controlled folding process biohacker42 describes:

I had the help of an interesting project wherein I had LOTS of freedom to learn and make stuff in a lab without the fetters of enterprise requirements... I began to love it.<p>Fast forward 2 years and I've changed jobs. I feel like I can hack my way out of any nasty problem. Java is more unweildy in this enterprise environment because we are leveraging several enterprisey frameworks, but we can make bigger strides. The framework is doing a lot for us. I am still making stuff. This job is a pressure-cooker, but I'm feeling very fulfilled and I'm advancing.<p>Fast forward 2 years and I've quit the pressure cooker to be a Rails contractor (actually, easier), I've even got a startup going. Ruby is powerful, and I tell everyone they should be using RoR instead of Java. I laugh at people who don't understand what they're missing.<p>Fast forward 2 years and I am back in a corporation. Using Java very sparingly to maintain lots of integrated systems. The problems are nasty, there is no feeling of 'making' anything. I resign myself to being the best maintainer I can be. I keep my sanity with side projects. It's easiest to use Python on App Engine, because I don't have to be a sys admin.<p>The more interesting problems you are solving the better the language you are using seems to be.

One of my peeves about inject being written in C is that there is very little pressure to make Ruby fast enough that inject could be written in Ruby. So who cares? Well, if you want to make your own language feature that is like inject but not inject, your feature will be 100x slower.<p>So making Ruby fast enough that Ruby can be implemented in Ruby is a huge win for metaprogrammers :-)<p>> Now it is not correct to say that Matz does not use Ruby. He does, and so he does eat his own dog food. And for the domains where he uses Ruby, he has optimized Ruby to be a useful tool. But since he doesn’t use Ruby to build Ruby, he does not have the same incentive to tune Ruby for the purpose of building languages.<p><a href=""http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/11/significance-of-meta-circular_22.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/11/significance-of-meta-cir...</a>",1251316923

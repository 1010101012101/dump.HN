Capitalism is practiced by individuals for their own self-interest.  Sometimes they work together for a shared self-interest (e.g. corporations, investor groups) or they work against each other as needed (competition).  But you cannot take self-interest out of the equation and still have capitalism.  Every trade (be that stock for cash, or work for cash, etc.) is predicated on each of the parties fulfilling their individual needs and wants to the degree that they can.  On it&#x27;s own terms, capitalism hasn&#x27;t failed at all.<p>What you can say is that capitalism has failed to mollify those that seek non-capitalistic goals.  This is true of some so-called capitalists who experience guilt in pursuing their self-interest as well.  If your view is that capitalists are &quot;greedy, top-hat-wearing&quot; types that fail to meet your social welfare goals, then my bet is your characterization masks a larger purpose.  Primarily at bringing them down, probably in favor of the central planners of old (or some degree thereof).<p>Perhaps the real question should be: why would companies and individuals with captial choose to sit on it, or choose to spend it on relatively worthless start-ups?  Why would a capitalist choose to sit on cash or buy-back shares if there are other, more profitable avenues to invest those funds?

That was 1977.  We now have millions more cameras and plenty of recorded car accidents because car accidents are in fact real.  Conversely, bigfoot and UFO footage has all but disappeared with the increased numbers of cameras.  Bigfoot is not real.  Neither are these superhuman yogis.  No doubt they can survive longer in harsh environments than the average person, but they cannot violate the laws of physics.

I was in a hospital bed attached to a heart rate monitor for a few hours, and I could, while conscious, consistently bring my heart rate under 50 bpm (which would set off an alarm at the nurse station). I believe I got down to 46. The alarm was appropriate, as this resting heart rate likely gets me to the high reaches of the 99th percentile [1].<p>I could do this by practicing a fairly technical breathing technique - basically opening up the channels of breath by joining inhalation and exhalation. Still, I was able to convince myself that by practicing a very specific relaxation technique, I could lower my heart rate enough to scare nurses. I&#x27;m standing while typing this and my thumb-to-wrist test has me right around normal (72bpm).<p>So, from my perspective, parts of this seem reasonable. I think a true master (I&#x27;ve only been doing this a few years) may well be able to continuously regulate his heart to quite low levels. I&#x27;ve often mused that yoga is a hack of some of your body&#x27;s autonomic processes. A flatline seems unrealistic even to me, but I&#x27;m sure curious about what benefits there might be in this technique.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr041.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr041.pdf</a>",1442880462

The Lisp community was, then, as now, committed to Lisp being the One True Way, and centered around the MIT AI lab. The PC revolution was happening, so naturally they built their own CPU, OS and workstations around Lisp. Half the MIT AI lab ended up going to Symbolics, and half to LMI. The West Coast hackers out of Berkeley and Stanford were more into C and Unix. Once the 68000 and the first Sun (especially), also Apollo, SGI workstations came out, they performed well at a broad range of tasks including even Lisp. C compiled software often outperformed similar software written in Lisp. And when volume ramped up (for 68000-based Macintosh as well) they had much better cost/performance compared to relatively low-volume Lisp machines.

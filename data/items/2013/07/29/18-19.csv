I&#x27;m certainly not an expert networker myself, but I would agree that being friendly with your business associates is very important to future business. It doesn&#x27;t mean you necessarily need to hang out with them - even just chatting a little bit about personal stuff once in a while helps to oil the wheels of business. People are human after all, and most people prefer doing business with people they like.",1375124377

Maybe it made sense back in the era where you&#x27;d work for a company for 2+ decades and retire on a pension, but we don&#x27;t live in that world anymore.<p>Loyalty is earned, not implicitly deserved. There are thousands of companies out there where a software engineer can show up, do quality work, and draw a salary and benefits. The fact that a company like Google happens to have an on-site masseuse or slightly better 401k plan doesn&#x27;t really mean anything at all; there are way bigger factors to consider: work/life balance, healthy management and corporate structure, good project planning, opportunities for personal growth, etc.<p>A company that big tends to have a lot of project churn and waste, too, so it&#x27;s not unnatural for some of that churn and waste to result in more people leaving than might be the average at a smaller company.",1375124336

Its just the same.<p>Its NOT the same. High costs in the US are essentially a result of policy corruption - a systemic issue with results in the exorbitant prices. Greed amongst doctors is prevalent in India as well as the US - maybe more prevalent in India due to general poverty. But health care in India is more &#x27;free-market&#x27; than in the US, which is why it is more efficient.<p>>>I&#x27;ve never been to US, but I can tell you the Indian health care system is if not less is equally greedy compared to their US counterparts. Its just the same.<p>I have been to the US and I have spent a huge time in India. I have witnessed the Indian health system in close quarters and have close family members undergone major surgeries. There is greed in India, no doubt about it. But the American system is completely EFFED up - there is no comparison. If you go to the US and spend some time understanding/experiencing the system, you will be thankful for what you have in India.<p>>>These days if you don&#x27;t have health insurance you are more or less screwed. Its just like the US. I mean from whatever I&#x27;ve read about US so far its the very same. Nothing changes. You just feel its cheaper as $1 = 60 rupees. There you get a straight 60x value of your money. That is what it is at the end of the day.<p>You are completely wrong about this only because you don&#x27;t know what happens in the US if you dont have insurance. My close family members have undergone major heart surgery at Narayanan Hrudyalaya. They had insurance, but even if the insurance did not cover it, it was not a big deal. I could have easily paid from my own pocket - it cost just over $2K USD - not a big amount for middle class Indians for life threatening surgery. All the prices are transparent - so if you dont want to pay as much you can choose cheaper options (shared post-op bedding etc.) which will reduce prices in half  - with very little difference in medical care.<p>In the US if you dont have insurance for something like this - you will go bankrupt. The only reason you don&#x27;t know about this is because most of your NRI friends work for bigger tech companies which provide good coverage.<p>Infact one of the reasons why health care is reasonable in India is because insurance coverage is limited and not mandated by law. The resulting free market delivers the economies quoted in this article.<p>>>Coming to our system. Forget greed, fraud in the system is so massively high nothing that I write here will explain it.<p>No it is NOT. There is a tendency in Indians to think that they are completely fucked up. Travel around the world - especially to the US and you will thank your stars - and please dont go with what NRI&#x27;s say - they have a vested interest.<p>It is true that there is greed in the system and there is fraud - but there is a relatively freer market. You can &#x27;choose&#x27; your doctors/hospitals. If you dont have a good experience with a hospital you can choose to write a review on Mouthshut.com and have them get less business. You can do your research and choose a better doctor/hospital over a worse one. This &#x27;choice&#x27; and the enabling free market makes India health care deliver economies at scale which are impossible in the American system.<p>>>The fees for completing your medical course is astronomically high. Capitation fee often runs in crores, the net fee by the time you finish your MD is so high no doubt most doctors have to practically turn into crooks to get something out of it. Add to this nearly more than a decade of studies sets a perfect stage for these sort of activities to happen.<p>Assuming that this does turn them into &#x27;crooks&#x27;, they have an easy way to get their money &#x27;out&#x27; - migrate to the US/UK after completing their residency. Some doctors are greedy, some are good. The greedy ones land up outside India as much if not less than inside.",1375124173

A somewhat-contrary finding is that one proxy measure of altruism, probability of a dropped letter being returned, was found to be lower in poorer neighborhoods of the UK: <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0043294"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a><p>The authors of that study have a brief discussion of possible differences in the scenarios:<p><i>Our overall findings replicate and expand on previous studies using similar methodology [9], [10] but are in contrast with the findings of Piff et al [11] who find that wealthy individuals in Berkeley, U.S.A. are more likely to not give way to other cars or pedestrians, and are more likely to behave selfishly or unethically in economic games. One possible explanation for these contradictory results is that Piff et al [11] findings are likely due to individual level differences, whilst our findings may stem mainly from contextual neighbourhood effects. Therefore our results may not be in conflict, if good socio-economic conditions in an area lead to increased trust and long-term thinking, even though, within any one neighbourhood, wealthier individuals are less altruistic than poorer people. If this is the case, we would predict that the lost letters in our experiment were more likely to be returned by the poorer individuals in the area, and that the wealthy residents of Berkeley would behave even less altruistic when in a poorer neighbourhoods. These latter hypotheses have yet to be tested. Alternatively, these contradictory results may be highlighting domain specific differences of altruistic behaviour between rich and poor people; for example anti-social behaviours involving competition (such as aggressive driving or cheating in an economic game) may be more common amongst the wealthy, whereas in a non-competitive task (such as returning a lost letter) wealthy individuals behave more altruistically than poor individuals.</i><p><i>In this study, we have shown that individuals living in poor neighbourhoods are less altruistic than individuals living in wealthier neighbourhoods. However, we have not been able to identify the specific neighbourhood characteristic behind this, due to income being strongly correlated with other factors, such as crime. Further research should focus on attempting to disentangle these two factors, possibly by comparing equally deprived neighbourhoods with different levels of crime.</i>",1375122585

I believe you can buy a COTS ApolLO-I board for your L1 signal.  I donno if 1575.50 would be close enough.  The smaller the .. forget the name but it boils down to the &quot;tuning step&quot; ... the worse the phase noise.  So generating an exact 1575.42 will have MUCH ickier phase noise possibly impacting the PSK data itself.  So is it better to have a noisy signal or be somewhat off frequency?  I donno.  COTS it&#x27;ll probably have the VFO tuned to be &quot;ideal&quot; for ham radio guys around 1152 MHz but you&#x27;ll want it a little higher, which it can do with a different smd 0204 sized inductor, but its going to take some soldering not just literally COTS.<p>There&#x27;s more than one way to skin a cat and there&#x27;s certainly a zillion ways to generate a stable-ish microwave signal.  For that matter a BPSK mod is not exactly exotic material, but if there&#x27;s a containerized COTS model for $65 its hard to find the motivation to hack up my own.  Maybe you could trade time for money and build one out of 10 cents of junk parts, but it&#x27;ll take time and gear to align and tune just right.<p>Note signal levels... You probably can&#x27;t feed any ole LO directly into any ole modulator and expect the power levels to magically match up.  And the levels the mod wants are probably not the levels of &quot;whatever&quot; your P/N code generator is outputing.<p>Do testing in a shielded cage to avoid an unfortunate appearance on the TV news.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that you&#x27;ve just built a C/A generator but without a nav code (at like all of 50 bps, so slow even an arduino could do it...) all you&#x27;re going to do is confuse the heck out of a RX....

As if you need to wander around asking weird questions like where to buy a &quot;modulo 2 adder&quot;... umm hint thats a pretty basic logic gate but if you can&#x27;t figure that out, well... as if an actual devoted adversary would be slowed down by kinda intentionally weird terminology.<p>I think a harder problem that generating &quot;a&quot; more or less valid C/A stream and &quot;a&quot; more or less valid nav message, is generating them with actual reasonable real world data to simulate being over 15 km altitude or whatever, and them scale it up to do at least 4 of those signals at once.<p>Probably an interesting noob-level RX countermeasure would be you need at least 4 to get a fix, so lazy people are just going to generate 4, probably in idea geometry with weird unlikely visibility (like the four you hear are all over the sky but just bad luck you can&#x27;t see another eight, yeah right)  Another one would be watching signal strengths, which will vary &quot;twinkle like stars&quot; for real satellites but lazy synthesizers will not vary.  Finally unless you go GPSDO (OH the IRONY) synth route, the homemade clocks the RX hears will probably be driftier than the real satellites.",1375122174

Why would I want to, say, have a serious 1:1 with my boss in a Romance Room?</i><p>Every early stage startup in San Francisco has an employee who is a combination secretary, HR person and vice president of ops. She usually went to an quirky college like UCSC or Evergreen and is often the ex-girlfriend of one of the founders or has some other quirky but never-again-mentioned relation to someone in the office. This employee&#x27;s main distinguishing characteristic is her high level of quirkiness. Her title is Vibe Director or VP of Vibe or Senior Vibeologist.<p>This quirky person is in charge of buying the snacks, getting the t-shirts printed, buying white board supplies, paying the bills, picking out the posters, ordering the Aerons and also higher level stuff like finding new office space. When the company gets a new office she is in charge of naming the office rooms. However, for some reason the CEO and other founders also find naming the rooms a very serious and important task. The names can&#x27;t simply be decided upon, there must be several heated meetings arguing the pros and cons of naming them after San Francisco Streets, or SF Neighborhoods, or cities in California. Since nobody wants to meet in Fresno or Bayshore or on Geary Street, this is a big deal and the meetings generally end with slammed doors, silent crying, and the vibemaster sitting alone in the nameless conference room with a 1000 yard stare into one of the whiteboards.<p>Then one day one of the investors visits the office and his adorable french bulldog starts humping the VP of Vibe&#x27;s adorable english bulldog in one of the still-unnamed rooms and a lightbulb simultaneously appears above everyone on the room naming committee&#x27;s heads.",1375121463

6122793,comment,6121234,6122448,0,0,smspence,,,"Of course we could all imagine a bunch of made-up names for rooms that would be inappropriate in a business setting.  Nobody is arguing that no such names exist.<p>My problem is simply with your entire approach to your argument.  What you are doing is very common on internet forums, and it is a cheap way to &quot;prove&quot; people wrong under any circumstances.  It is called black-and-white thinking.  Here is the template:  &quot;If you think this one small thing is true, then you must think EVERYTHING ever in the entire world is true!!!&quot;  Obviously, you will be able to think of some example in the world that is false (even if your example is not what the original person was arguing for or against), so then you will feel like you have accomplished your goal (you have proved the person wrong).<p>Here is where we start going down this rabbit hole:<p><i>The logic that you can simply dismiss any room name as being appropriate...</i><p>Keyword here is &quot;any&quot;.  Who in this thread tried to argue that ANY room name should be appropriate?  (Hint: nobody tried to argue this.  You just made this argument up so you could shoot it down.)<p><i>...it&#x27;s an example of one such room name that cannot be interpreted any way but inappropriately.</i><p>Yep, you&#x27;re right, inappropriate language exists in the world.  Nobody can argue against this.  And nobody HAS argued against this.<p>Here, I will use your method of argument against you:\nYou are WRONG to think that &quot;Employee Fuck Room&quot; is an inappropriate name.  What if it was in the offices of a company that produces pornography?  Then it would be very appropriate here.  It would be especially appropriate if this company had very edgy office vibe that encouraged this type of language.  Also, what if someone ran a small shop that specialized in distributing super-offensive memes on the internet?  They could have a room called &quot;Employee Fuck Room&quot; and get away with it, and one could argue it would be totally appropriate in drumming up the types of ideas they need to run their business.  See!!  I completely made up a couple examples that show how you could be wrong in some tiny edge case, therefore, you are 100% WRONG.<p>See how stupid that is?<p>This style of argument can lead to some real gems.  (Bonus, religious-nut-themed example: &quot;If you think gay people should be able to marry each other, then you must also think that a monkey and a toaster should be able to marry each other!!&quot;)<p>The world is not black and white.  If I think some name is ok, I don&#x27;t have to think that ALL names are ok.  I have a brain that is able to pick and choose.  I don&#x27;t have to just think in black and white, ALL GOOD, or ALL BAD.<p>Here&#x27;s a novel concept:  How about we just understand that people will disagree with each other once in a while, and move on with our lives.  Some people here can think that &quot;Romance Room&quot; is a silly and fun office name, and some people will have no problem with it.  Some OTHER people will disagree.  And that is fine.  You don&#x27;t need to try to convince everyone to come over to one side or the other.  Some of us can just disagree, or agree, and we can just move on with our lives.",1375121349

6122749,comment,6122494,6122494,1,0,cliveowen,,,"This post is a monument to an all-american phenomenon: the culture of excess.<p>Americans are always after the fastest, deadliest, most gruesome, most muscular, richest, more, more and more.\nObjective reporting is not enough, the public wants to see decapitated corpses. It doesn&#x27;t matter if some girl has been raped, they want the details, or it didn&#x27;t happen.<p>A bank has been robbed, the news doesn&#x27;t suffice, they want to see the police chase from the live cable TV. There&#x27;s food, they want fast food. They got fast food, they have to supersize it, so they can be the fattest nation too. It&#x27;s not enough to go to gym, to workout, to leave a healthy life. No, you have to push your body to the limit, get sick if need be.<p>It&#x27;s time to recognize that this mindset is toxic. The winner-takes-all system is the bane of modern society. Capitalism is based on the notion that the purchasing power of the middle class is superior than that of any given individual or group, but now everyone wants to be an entrepreneur, the winner, erode the middle class until there&#x27;ll be the reigning elite on one side and the unemployed, unwashed masses on the other.<p>And do you know what middle class equals to? average.\nYou work 9 to 5, you have kids, a car and maybe a home. You&#x27;re average. But nobody wants to be average right?\nNo, everyone wants more, and in the end, there&#x27;s no equilibrium. A world where everyone wants to be the best, the winner, where nobody is happy with what already has, it&#x27;s a sad, sick world.<p>I hope is not too late to turn the tide.",1375120963
6122748,comment,6113798,6114338,1,0,Shorel,,,"Honestly, OSX / iOS is the counterexample for convergence. Apple has two different OS, two different application ecosystems, period.<p>They simply saw Apple success, and adapted. The goal of every company now is to be the portable leader, and abandon the PC ship. It worked for Apple because they have never been competitors in PC space. The same for Google. MS is taking a long gamble, but they are the PC leader and have the most to lose.<p>Going back to convergence: Google wants just a browser as the desktop OS, and that&#x27;s not convergence at all, unless you think Responsive Web Design is convergence. Microsoft is the one doing something a little similar to Ubuntu, but their OS can&#x27;t do desktop and portable/touch well at the same time. Or actually, their OS can do both, but it is designed in a way that no application can do both, and that hurts developers.",1375120954

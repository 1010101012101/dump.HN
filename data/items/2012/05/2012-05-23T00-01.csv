4010895,comment,4009999,4010562,1,0,shabble,,,"No, the major benefit of virtual memory is simplicity for applications.<p>Instead of having to be aware of everything else in memory, and carefully allocating around other things and taking care not to step on each other, it can just assume that nothing else exists, and it has the whole addressable range to put things where it likes.<p>This isn't really true of course, it's a bit like being given a magical chest-of-drawers in which both you and your friends can use the same drawer, but every time you open it, it only has your own things inside. And behind the scenes, there's a little imp shifting stuff in and out depending on who's pulling the handle.<p>The virtual addressing part is the sharing of those drawers, the swapping part is if, instead of having only 4 drawers, there are now 8, or 16, or any number. If you open one of these drawers that doesn't actually exist, the imp rummages around in a bigger box in the next room, finds it, and fills whatever is meant to be there.
He also sedates you if this happens, so the change appears 'instant' to you.<p>Because going into the other room is slow for him (and also you, but you might not necessarily notice because you're unconscious) he keeps a bunch of the most recent or most common things around close to hand on his side of the drawers so he can swap them quickly. Every time you need something that isn't nearby, he has to take something out with him to make space, and come back with the new thing.<p>There's a reasonable argument that this latter part (swapping) can be optional - you don't really have infinite memory like you're pretending, it's still limited to either the amount you can address, or the amount you can store in your secondary storage. And, comparatively, the secondary storage is really damn slow. But, for those occasional times when you <i>just</i> pass the limit, being able to handle that without crashing or the kernel arbitrarily nuking something to make space, it's useful.",1337734225

It's public-key pinning (the thing inside the cert). You can change certs all you want without changing the public key, and the same TACK pin will be valid for all of them.

4010878,comment,4009999,4010831,1,0,astrodust,,,"I'm saying ""better"" does not equal ""successful"".<p>AMD lived for years in Intel's shadow and barely scraped by, surviving only because they were willing to price their chips lower than Intel wanted to. Their success came only when Intel fumbled and, to their credit, the Athlon series of chips was in its prime. I'd argue they were only successful at that point because they were better <i>and</i> cheaper than the Intel chips at the time which were unusually under-performing and over-priced. They were only cheaper because they had years of experience in surviving at the bottom end of the market. They also marketed like their life depended on it.<p>ARM is something of an anomaly. They were as much as left for dead, with conventional wisdom thinking one of Motorola, IBM or even Intel would run them over like a bug on the road. That didn't come to pass because none of those companies ever seriously committed to building a modern but very low power CPU. They squeaked through a hole.<p>To credit NVidia with the success of 3Dfx is misleading. It was the Voodoo card that was marketed aggressively to consumers which, at the time, cared little for 3D performance. NVidia picked them up at a yard sale when they were run out of the market by more successful companies like ATI and, at the time, Matrox. It was NVidia's acquisition of 3Dfx that showed they were serious about the consumer market and not just ultra high-end applications. Making one GPU for both consumer and professional markets gave them the edge to remain competitive.<p>All three of these companies got lucky. They say you can engineer your own luck, and with that I can't disagree, but they never had a ""better"" product until the other guy dropped the ball or they could crack open a new market.",1337733867

Even where the technology breaks down, a single point of failure (autonomous driving system) is far easier to analyze, budget for, and litigate from a product liability point of view. Google is much more likely to be a rational actor than an aggregated population of vehicle users, and risk premium can be very easily calculated for the number of vehicles that are deployed. As adoption increases, the roads are likely to get safer and faster; my only real worry would be about whether manual driving would be restricted and penalized. Then again, since I don't have a car that's largely an academic concern to me. I used to enjoy riding a motorcycle but I feel fairly confident that an automated driver would do a better job than I would over the long haul.<p>The other big reason is economic; with all the data pointing towards automated driving as the wave of the future and the leading commercial innovator being here in California, and California facing a $16 billion deficit, the prospect of Mountain View becoming Detroit 2.0 for a global market is a no-brainer. California has also been quietly stepping towards building an electric car infrastructure: Gov. Brown used his powers to take a windfall legal settlement related to the CA power crisis a decade ago (think Enron) and apply it to the construction of charging infrastructure without needing to get legislative approval. <a href=""http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=17463"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=17463</a><p>I'm thinking that automated clean vehicle swarms are the increasingly-credible strategic alternative to high-speed rail in California. I really like trains, but the HSR project looks like a fiscal, bureaucratic, and legal disaster. If we can slash the costs of driving then we could probably cut down the cost of vehicle construction, not to mention creating an entirely new set of goods for manufacture. With reliable automated vehicles, you don't necessarily need people to drive them, so pickup and delivery could essentially be done by autonomous large wheelbarrows instead of needing to have cabs on the front for humans to sit in.<p>Also, Johnny cabs: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjRXyWFLkEY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjRXyWFLkEY</a>",1337733302

I'd like to hear what you think is wrong with what I said.<p>I do know that he specifically focuses on how technologies gradually advance so that we're forced to use them. He refers to this as ""control"" and describes how technologies don't seem harmful independently, but as each technology forces itself upon us, the combination becomes more and more controlling, until we're completely controlled by the whole. It's as if technology is slowly chipping away at the foundation of freedom through compromise, or something like that.<p>Now, what I said was that he focuses on the controlling aspect of what were at first seemingly innocent technologies that were absolutely beneficial, but he doesn't see the increase in freedom that the same technologies provide over the long term. Yes, there are stop lights, roads, licenses, and jobs are further away from home, forcing us to own carsbut at the same time, you can go anywhere you want within hours instead of days. Is it controlled? Yes. But even with the control, the total amount of freedom the individual has is now increased, because one is no longer confined to a small area.<p>Kaczynski uses the neighbor scenariothere are two neighbors, and one is more powerful than the other. This more powerful neighbor asks the other to give him land, to which the weak one says ""no."" So the powerful one offers a compromise where he only gets half of the land he had asked for. The weak neighbor can't refuse. This goes on and on until the powerful neighbor has all the land. My argument here is that while the powerful neighbor might be taking away land, the big picture is that the powerful neighbor is also offering the weak neighbor lots more land <i>somewhere else</i>. Yes, technology takes our traditional freedom (the already established plots of land), but simultaneously extends our freedom in new directions (new plots of land). Kaczynski only views freedom as something that can be subtracted but not added to.<p>Perhaps I understand his arguments incorrectly, but this is what I've gotten out of what I've read. If you don't agree, go ahead and explain what's wrong, but don't just make an empty claim like that.",1337732961

Just because your personal view may see a large number of expensive android devices doesn't reflect the reality of the population. The figures however do show us what is going on, the android sale is the 'cheap/low end' phone.<p>Samsung have a 29.1% marketshare of smart phones by volume. (IDC)
Apple has a 24.2% marketshare of smart phone by volume. (IDC)
The others don't crack 10% each.<p>Samsung won't reveal revenue for Android, for reasons that will become obvious shortly, but they do reveal their entire mobile division has 17B revenue.
This division shipped 144.4M mobile phones, 42M of those were smart phones, a figure slightly lower than that belong to Android. We can be lenient and pretend that the bulk of the 17B revenue were from pricier Android devices, even though this would be fallacious.<p>Apple's iPhone business (not iPod/iPad) has revenue of 23B, already exceeding Samsung's entire mobile business.<p>Samsung lead Android sales commanding ~40% of the Android market share.<p>Meaning that the largest seller of Android smartphones, who sells more smartphones than any other producer including Apple is making 75% the amount of revenue of Apple, on not just their Android business, but their total mobile division where Android makes up a fraction of it. This can only mean one thing. The average selling price of those Android devices is well below 75% of the average iPhone sale.

You got out to eat and order a $7.95 burger/fries and a $1.50 soda[1]... most people already know that it'll be more than $10. It is not so hard to do the math. Since tax around here is in the 8.5-9.5% range, most of the time it can be safe to just double the tax on the receipt to get roughly 17-19% tip... round up if you want to show extra thanks... down if not. Many places will also print on the receipt the various percentages of tip so you don't even really have to do much at all but some multi-digit addition. So unless one has a hard time with ""carry the 1"" the math isn't that bad. I tend to over tip so I can get my grand total to a nice round number.

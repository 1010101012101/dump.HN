4285279,comment,4285207,4285207,2,0,drostie,,,"As the article suggests, the fact that light carries energy and momentum (and even that those are related by E = p c) were explained by classical electromagnetic theory before Einstein -- and further the chief effect of general relativity on the Pioneers in the is just Newtonian gravitation. The fact that the spacecraft radiates thermally is due to Max Planck. The use of ""Einstein"" in this article is highly misleading because the Pioneer anomaly exists at scales where Einstein's work was not of major importance.<p>That's not to say that I don't like Einstein; I and every physicist I know like him. Einstein is great because, though he did bring a bunch of genius to the field (especially in general relativity), his major discoveries from 1905 are <i>mostly unoriginal</i>. That may seem like an odd point to praise, but let me emphasize that it required a certain bravery to do what he did with them. So his three 1905 discoveries are ""You have to take Ludwig Boltzmann seriously when he talks about atoms! They would have a length scale, here's how you would find out about it through diffusion experiments."" and ""You have to take Max Planck seriously when he says light comes in lumps! They would only kick electrons with a certain amount of energy, here's how you would use this to explain the photoelectric effect."" and ""You have to take Lorentz transforms seriously when they say that the speed of light is something we all agree on! Here's why the equations don't lead to contradictions if we're clear on what we mean by 'synchronizing clocks' etc.""<p>So he's doing some work with real, cutting insight, but he's doing it on someone else's intriguing observations, to show that those paradoxical results must be taken seriously. It's really due to Einstein that we can have a physics culture where crazy ideas like quantum field theory or string theory are worked out in detail, to see whether the paradoxical appearance is surface or deeper.<p>So we all love Einstein, but this article isn't why. It's not that Einstein was miraculously right, it's that Einstein was brave enough to take others seriously.",1343131025

4285271,comment,4285062,4285062,1,0,bjornsing,,,"Interesting question, but IMHO a rather crap analysis. They don't seem to make any distinction between completely separate legal issues.<p>For example, I'm sure the DoD could classify some software that was a derivative work of some GPL licensed work as top secret. IANAL buy my guess is that the classification itself would probably be upheld by a court, but that wouldn't bring the DoD into compliance with the GPL. I cannot imagine that. It would be a complete carte blanche for the DoD in regards to any and all IPR. Even if they could legally do it I cannot imagine them doing it. It would be outright theft.<p>The same goes for modifying the GPL. I can go and rip off the GPL and license my software under the ""Bjornsing GPL Derivative License"" all I want. If somebody licenses my software under those terms they are no less bound by the license just because I stole the license itself. That's a separate issue between me and the FSF (and possibly between me and the state if deemed criminal copyright infringement). At least so I imagine. Again IANAL.",1343130773

4285251,comment,4281480,4281480,2,0,Janteloven,,,"This is far too simplistic an analysis. Making new security laws takes time, particularly in a positive-law tradition state like Norway. So it is too early to say what the effects will be. Without a doubt changes are being made to Norway's security apparatus, in fact the securitization of the Norwegian state is much talked about in policy circles here. There is talk of moving from a 'Prestige' set of policies to 'Security' as the guiding principle.<p>I don't think any state could sit by and do nothing institutionally after such a terrible event. The problem in Norway is that whilst there is a self-congratulatory air about their response to Brevik - ""love and democracy"", they do not seem to want to engage in substantive debate about the planned changes to their security apparatus. To be honest they <i>trust</i> their government to do the right thing, even if that means extremely illiberal changes to the legal right of the person and the criminal system. Whether that trust is misplaced or not, and remember this is a highly consensual society, the Janteloven that Brevik has revealed will be controlled now via new laws - including new laws on using the Internet and making comments (Brevik was a big user of the internet and left comments on Norwegian websites).",1343130374

The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is to create an executable program.""<p>Note how it says ""the target language, often having a binary form known as object code."" and ""The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is to create an executable program.""<p>If you then go down into the description, you'll see: ""The front end checks whether the program is correctly written in terms of the programming language syntax and semantics. Here legal and illegal programs are recognized. Errors are reported, if any, in a useful way. Type checking is also performed by collecting type information. The frontend then generates an intermediate representation or IR of the source code for processing by the middle-end.<p>The middle end is where optimization takes place. Typical transformations for optimization are removal of useless or unreachable code, discovery and propagation of constant values, relocation of computation to a less frequently executed place (e.g., out of a loop), or specialization of computation based on the context. The middle-end generates another IR for the following backend. Most optimization efforts are focused on this part.<p>The back end is responsible for translating the IR from the middle-end into assembly code. The target instruction(s) are chosen for each IR instruction. Register allocation assigns processor registers for the program variables where possible. The backend utilizes the hardware by figuring out how to keep parallel execution units busy, filling delay slots, and so on. Although most algorithms for optimization are in NP, heuristic techniques are well-developed.""<p>So, just stating that it is ""a computer program that transforms source code written in a programming language into another computer language"" is inadequate.

I got the job, and I'm happy where I am ever since.<p>Have evidence of your skills -- be it an online portfolio, some code examples that you can explain/demonstrate, or evidence of contributions to projects and a working knowledge of the technologies you need.<p>Have evidence that you're able to deliver -- it's okay to be working on your own website on and off for six months, but in the 'real world' there are deadlines. Have some evidence that you're able to work to deadlines.<p>Be passionate about the kind of work you're wanting to get in to. -- If you're not working on your own projects outside of work, you're not passionate. This isn't just a job to pay the bills.<p>Specialise - There's no benefit to being 'okay' across the board, nobody will take that seriously. Any good company/startup with an idea for the position they're trying to fill will want a specific set of skills. I went from being a 'web designer' in my previous job (which was a broad term that encompassed anything from creating HTML emails, resizing images, writing jQuery, fixing cross-browser bugs, writing batch scripts to parse xml/xslt with saxon, writing bespoke PHP/MySQL applications, etc.) to being a 'front-end developer' in my current job (which means I'm focussing more on css/html/javascript, championing these areas in the application/website the company is building, being the 'go to' guy for queries regarding these areas, working with designs designed by a designer, and working with a back-end/processes put together by our back-end developers).<p>Be able to demonstrate or put across that you're able to work well, and work well within a team.<p>Besides that, I'd say some basic skills for a front-end developer are:<p>- able to craft valid HTML<p>- know your way around CSS quirks and how to fix them, especially cross-browser quirks.<p>- write well-formatted code<p>- be familiar with CMS/templating engines. If you're familiar with variables, condition statements and for-loops in one language, you should be able to pick up most templating engines.<p>- know your software and be able to justify your reasons for using it over other software<p>- know the major browsers.<p>A lot of teams these days are using Agile/Scrum methodology for development, so having some understanding or working experience of using Agile might be useful depending on the job you're going in to.<p>Don't worry if you don't have all of the skills necessary for a job, in many cases not understanding a specific library/language isn't an issue providing you have some equivalent understanding of another language and are able to learn. Some personal examples:<p>- in previous job I hadn't used XSLT at all before starting there, but I had an extensive knowledge of PHP/Wordpress templating, so getting used to the syntax of XSLT wasn't very hard, and I picked it up in a week.<p>- in current job, I had no prior experience with Django but again using similar templating languages in the past helped and I've had no problems. (Also for some side projects such as my personal blog, I use Jekyll which uses liquid-tags similar to Django templates, so that skill has improved/carried over)",1343127618

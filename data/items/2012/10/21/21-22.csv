There are rules and laws about these things.<p>If the outlet has a T-slot on one side, it can take 125V 20A plugs (125*20 = 2.5kW) as well as the traditional 125V 15A plugs. They're different plugs. You can't pull 20A across 15A wires.

4680981,comment,4680579,4680579,-1,0,rerere,,,"Nathan Myrhvold is a grossly obese man who owns a large patent portfolio, managed through thousands of shell companies under the umbrella of ""Intellectual Ventures.""  He first made his bones as was  CTO of Microsoft.  However, unlike a lot of the original founders, he wasn't    satisfied with what he got, so he moved into the patent trolling business.  These days, he makes his money by extorting technology companies, usually behind closed doors.<p>To make himself feel better about what he does, he tries to minimize the importance of what those technology companies are doing-- they're just building ""stupid stuff,"" after all.  He also sponsors research into vaccines and technologies to help the third world.  Like Bill G himself,  he views this as his way of doing penance for the bad things he's done to get where he is.<p>The truth is, though, it doesn't work like that.  Most of the problems in the third world are the result of bad government.  Unless we want to bring back colonialism, trying to ""fix"" the third world with aid is just putting a band-aid on a broken leg.  In the long term, there are only two final destinies for  humanity-- extinction, and the singularity.  People like Mr. Myrhvold make the  first outcome more likely.",1350856647

But it's really hard to let go of them. I now own an e-reader, but even if I could get all of those books on it (which seems impossible, if not very expensive and for no good reason), I would feel something missing. Then again, they do take much space, gather dust and are likely to be left untouched.<p>Gifts from people - whilst I can relatively easily throw away stuff I bought, it's so much harder with gifts people gave me. It almost feels like betraying them.<p>Any practical or (pop)-psychology suggestions on how to get over these hurdles?",1350856617
4680977,comment,4680579,4680793,1,0,kushalc,,,"(Am original author)<p>YES, I totally agree! :) <p>At Vittana (the org I founded), we joke there are only three ways to _really_ change the world.<p>* religions: whether you believe in God or the Flying Spaghetti Monster, you gotta agree that religion has affected world history<p>* governments: law & order, basic needs, wars -- name it, it's probably there<p>* markets: biotech, microchip, Internet, space -- need I say more?<p>In fact, I'd argue that if you look at the past 50 years, even in the United States but certainly elsewhere (e.g. the Asian Tigers), and all of the incredible things we've seen -- the biotech, microchip, Internet, space revolutions -- you could trace it all back to education.<p>And in particular (at least in the United States), I'd wager you could probably trace it all back to the GI Bill: that, for the first time, an entire generation could finish college if they wanted. You see similar investments in education elsewhere.<p>When that happens (assuming non-dysfunctional governments like in Egypt, etc.), you see a generation of people both creating and filling in opportunity for themselves through industry. That's what excites us.<p>At Vittana, we focus on providing education micro-loans to fight youth poverty. It's very much about a hand up, not a hand out: not a donation and not aid, but a business partnership among equals.<p>Take Ana Lizbeth, for instance, one of my favorite students: she wanted to be a programmer but needed $713 to graduate -- because of a Vittana Loan, that became possible.<p><a href=""http://blog.vittana.org/ana-lizbeth-a-mothers-dream-and-determination"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.vittana.org/ana-lizbeth-a-mothers-dream-and-dete...</a><p>We're not starting the cult or island nation of Vittana anytime soon -- I'm certainly not ;) -- so that leaves us with free markets. Our hope is that by going first, we can show others that education micro-loans are _possible_ to do and spark others to do it too.<p>Big fixes don't really work, but sometimes crazy, risky small ideas turn into big movements. That's our hope at least. :)<p>And thank you for the welcome! I've actually been with HN almost since the beginning (2,046 days  just happened to see earlier) but haven't been active/been busy building Vittana.

I'd also like a log and a notification when they look it up, so I know I'm not being stalked, and so they actually put thought into deciding whether or not it's appropriate to look up my location before doing so.<p>I imagine an app which doesn't send my location to a third party service on an interval. When somebody wants to look up my location, the app on their phone sends a request to some third party service over the Internet, which then pushes a request for my location to my phone. The first time the request comes in from a particular user, it asks me if I'd like to grant them this privilege permanently, temporarily, or to block it. If I grant it, then I don't need to approve future lookups but I am alerted to them happening.<p>[edit] The requests could also be of the style: ""Let me know when you arrive at location x"", instead of just ""Let me know where you are now"".

I went and bought some furniture though, which I now regret. Still, at least its Ikea, which I view as single use (meaning you get rid of it when you move).<p>New York is a particularly interesting one for this. So many times I see posts of people moving to here that say something like ""Looking for a quiet 2 bedroom apartment in UWS/Chelsea/West Village for $2000/month"", which apart from being completely unrealistic leads to the inevitable exchange:<p>Me: do you need a 2 bedroom?<p>Them: yes<p>Me: why?<p>Them: err... (I've always had one|for my stuff)<p>Me: that'll cost you $4000/month in your listed areas. A 1 bedroom will cost you $3000 or under.<p>At this point people have to choose between location, money and stuff. Some choose stuff and move out to Brooklyn, NJ or Queens. Others choose money and pay it anyway. Many choose location and downsize.

Regularly items are submitted, only for people to say that since it's nothing to do with programming, technology, startups, or entrepreneurship, then it's not suitable for HN.<p>Quoting the guidlelines:<p><pre><code>    On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting.\n    That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to\n    reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that\n    gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.\n</code></pre>\nThose are the guidelines as laid down by our host, and that's fair enough.

I'd like to add:<p><pre><code>    If it's not in some way specific to the interests of hackers,\n    then it's probably off-topic.\n</code></pre>\nI submit a lot of stuff about education and mathematics, because I think these are subjects that interest hackers, but not the wider public.  Topics that of more general interest I'd like to say don't really belong here.<p>This submission, in particular, should be of wide-spread, ubiquitous interest.  It shouldn't be in any way specific to hackers, technologists, programmers, or entrepreneurs.  In that way I believe that although it is and should be of interest to pretty much everyone here (including non-Americans) it is in no way specific to the interests of the community, and hence it is not really on topic.<p>So yes, I'm pleased to have seen it.

All cancers are covered.  If a cancer is treatable then it is treated.  If there's no hope than palliative care is provided.  If it's in the quite wide margin then the patient and the doctor talk about current best practice, and decide based on what the patient wants.<p>If you're asking about how the people paying the bills decide what treatments can be funded and what treatments should not be funded, well, you develop a measure.  That measure is something like ""years of quality life"" - Quality of Life Years is used in bit of English planning.<p>You have an independent body assessing evidence of effectiveness, vs cost. If something provides X QoLYs it gets permission for funding; if it doesn't the patient can fund it themselves.[1]<p>They then publish their documentation, and it gets reviewed every few years.<p>That's a transparent process, allowing people to review and challenge the choices made.<p>This can lead to some odd decisions.  Treatment for some forms of age-related macular degeneration used to be limited to one eye, because being blinded is bad, but being blinded in one eye is not as bad.  That decision was later changed.<p>Alongside that you tell people to stop smoking, and you offer them free smoking cessation services; you have strong H&S COSHH laws, and you enforce them; you educate about the dangers of too much sun[2]; etc etc.<p>[1] The UK had an unfortunate situation where drug companies were creating cancer treatment drugs that would provide maybe 30 days of extra life at a cost of tens of thousand of pounds.  They then set up and funded patient advocacy groups who would call for the drugs to be funded on the NHS.  Providing information to those groups was an effective way to bypass the strict laws against marketing to the public.  The weird choice the government at the time made was to change a law so that if someone wanted to ""top up"" their treatment with one of these expensive but useless meds that person would have to fund all their treatment, not just the cost of those extra meds.<p>[2] Vitamin D is very important, and helps avoid some cancers.

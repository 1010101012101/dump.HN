A speaking engagement is most likely a networking event. You arrive at this event with a high level of credibility already established - you are a speaker.<p>2. Preparing to speak to a group often forces you to clarify your priorities in a way that you haven't been forced to before.

The main reasons to buy a house still apply, but I have some more: living in my own house will mean I will not have to deal with a landlord, and this will give me some more time. Moreover living alone (now I have flatmates), I will pay someone to clean the house instead of doing it myself. I value my time more than the money cleaners ask. Washing machine for clothes, dishwasher for dishes and I don't iron clothes at all (if you learn how to hang them it's almost  useless). And there are the weekends, of course.<p>To avoid the burnout, I made up some rules: no work in the evenings, so when I go home from work and I'm tired I don't have the pressure on myself and I can spend those 2 hours after dinner relaxing. On friday I dance tango, on weekends I usually go to parties or out with friends. I go running for one hour every weekend.

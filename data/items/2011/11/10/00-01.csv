3218286,comment,3217995,3217995,3,0,tikhonj,,,"While I agree that ""science"" (as defined in the article) is a very good way to make use of data, I do not think the data without the science is useless.<p>For one, if you collect the data now you can always apply the ""science"" later--as long as you have the data and can query it, you're always ready. This alone means that collecting data now could be useful even if you have no idea of what to do with it. Storage is relatively cheap, and you--or somebody else--might come up with a clever way to analyze it in the future.<p>Additionally, I think the author underestimates the potential of machine learning. I am by no means an expert in the field (I'm taking an AI class--that has to count for something! ;) I hope) but even the simple techniques we've covered can get some interesting information without much domain knowledge involved. As ML evolves, I suspect there will be more and more technology that can find interesting trends and relationships in data regardless of what the data is actually modelling. The article does mention ML a bit, but I think it will be much more significant in the near future.<p>Ultimately, figuring out what questions to ask about data and harnessing human curiosity will give you much more than just hoarding data. I just think it's possible that sufficiently abstract and generic approaches in the near future will make it easier to get similar--or perhaps orthogonal--results using techniques from ML and AI. I firmly believe that hoarding the data without doing anything to it is still much better than not collecting it at all.",1320886006

To be clear, both companies are offering a $100,000+ salary, but my family is going through some pretty severe financial troubles that eat up about $5,000 every month.)<p>So I'm wondering if I could take the offer at the smaller company, and simply do a small amount of consulting (5-8 hours a week) on the side to help make up the difference. Is this normal/okay? What are the rules around this?<p>The consulting wouldn't affect my main job, and they would be in distinct areas of work. Is this essentially ""unofficially okay"" (do people do this all time and no one cares as long as you don't talk a lot about it publicy)? Is it not recommended at all? Or is it even pretty officially okay (so that I could, for instance, state on my website that I'm looking for part-time consulting, without worrying about consequences)?<p>Update to add: in my offer letter from the startup, the non-compete clause essentially says (paraphrasing)... Duty not to compete: My work at the company requires my undivided attention. I will not, without the company's written consent, engage in any other business that directly competes with the company, uses any of the company's materials, or otherwise conflicts with the company's business interests.",1320885336

From what I know of the author's other writings, observer reports are examined for plausibility on the basis of all available evidence, including evidence about how human observers can misperceive things they think they are observing. If someone tells me, ""I see a moving light in the sky,"" I can respond with, ""Let's look at how it moves, and see if it is an airplane or a satellite."" If the observer says, ""It's neither; it's a spaceship from another star system,"" my response would be ""What evidence do you have for that?"" The point is that the observer of something unusual (a sea monster never observed by a professional biologist, or even an experienced fisherman) should have more evidence than the bare observation for a claim that something that unusual exists.",1320883632

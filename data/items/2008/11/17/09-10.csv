It's 3:25 am and I'm still recovering from a cold so I'm going to call it a night, but expect an update on the Posterous blog tomorrow: <a href=""http://blog.posterous.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.posterous.com</a><p>====================<p>UPDATE 2: I couldn't sleep, so I kept working on it. I've just popped an early version of it live for you to try out. All you have to do is surround your code block with the following tags:<p><pre><code>  [code] \n  your code here \n  [/code]\n</code></pre>\nAdditionally, if you want to get fancy, you can specify a language with the following syntax:<p><pre><code>  [code lang='java']\n  public static boolean isAwesome = true;\n  [/code]\n</code></pre>\nThis should work for both through the web interface and through the email interface.<p>The available list of languages is: \n'cpp', 'c', 'c++', 'c#', 'c-sharp', 'csharp', 'css', 'delphi', 'pascal', 'java', 'js', 'jscript', 'javascript', 'php', 'py', 'python', 'ruby', 'rails', 'ror', 'sql', 'vb', 'vb.net', 'xml', 'xhtml', 'xslt', 'html', 'xhtml'<p>Current known issues: HTML formatting might be a little spotty at the moment. Will be fixing asap. I also see some intermittent errors where the code isn't getting properly recognized.<p>Please report any bugs to me at garry@posterous.com. Thanks for all the support and ideas. Please do keep the feature ideas coming -- the best way to reach us is to email help@posterous.com, but voting up to the top of Hacker News works too. ;-)",1226915272

(""not boring"" is probably the wrong answer) What gives your company personality? What would the person get to work on? and why is it interesting?<p>I looked at the website and it didn't really grab my attention.<p>What a lot of people seem to forget when recruiting is that you often have to sell your company and the position just as if you were selling anything else. Companies with well known brands have the advantage of a known culture (most of the time) or simply just brand awareness, which they leverage to get quality applications (or at least more of them). Startups and small to midsize companies don't have that advantage. So, if you want the best talent, you have to sell your company like you would sell your product. Undirected marketing of your company & jobs will usually produce fairly random response.<p>A very well read book in the HR/Recruiting community is called ""Hire With Your Head"". I recommend anyone that who needs to hire read it. The best takeaway quote...<p>""Companies need to move away form a classified ad mentality of listing boring, hard-to-find jobs and, instead, adopt a consumer marketing approach to advertising"" ~Lou Adler, Hire With Your Head",1226914356

I have not and will not ever sell an ad on it.  But I have made a few hundred dollars (hmm, might be 4 figures by now, will have to check) from mentions of my own software.

Most companies take on debt. Having a high stock price also discourages hostile take overs, but the shareholders themselves don't matter.<p>I want to know why you think they do. Many people say that shareholders matter and use them as an excuse for their actions. I think it is just that: an excuse.",1226912469
366711,comment,366692,366701,0,0,Maktab,,,"At the same time, this also sheds some more light on Africa's problems. One of which is logistics.<p>The continent's security is hampered by its sheer size and the massive borders of many of its countries. What this means it that few countries have the funds for large and capable enough security forces to exercise control over the whole of their territory. So outside the cities, large parts of the countryside exist in a security vacuum where thugs, rebels, criminals and assorted other unsavoury types essentially have free reign.<p>It also hampers trade and communication. With communities being spread out over such huge distances, transport infrastructure and the associated costs become vital. But few African nations can afford to maintain proper highway networks and even if they could, there's a lack of sufficient transport capability to effectively utilise it. As a result, intra-state trade is severely limited and inter-state trade even more so. This logistics problem also affects the delivery of aid.<p>To be fair, this isn't true of all African countries. South Africa and Egypt, for example, are notable exceptions for having a security presence throughout the country, a well-developed and advanced transport infrastructure and so on. But bringing countries like the DRC, CAR & Uganda up to the same level is not going to be an easy task.<p>One hope lies in having less of a top-down socialist central-planning approach and more encouragement of a federal self-organising entrepreneurial environment to encourage communities to grow themselves and gradually build their own transport and communications networks outwards. Technology will make this easier, but I think anybody expecting an economic revolution in Africa anytime soon is holding on to a false hope.",1226912461

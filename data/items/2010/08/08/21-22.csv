I have an N900 on T-Mobile in Boston and it's been very disappointing. I had visions of a ""data only"" relationship with the phone, but neither Skype nor SIP over 3G are of acceptable quality. Over wifi, works pretty well, though.<p>How have you set yours up? I tried Google Voice -> Gizmo5, buying a skype number, and some other things and nothing worked. For instance, the phone can't seem to handle an incoming SIP call and phone call at the same time -- so I couldn't forward my Google Voice number to both my actual cell number and SIP, and answer with either depending on the situation.<p>Then, I have general issues with the phone -- no good maps solution (the Nokia program is terrible, and can't use Google Maps), email is painfully slow to open and inconsistent about polling every 5 minutes like I want it to, I've hung up on incoming calls several times because the ""Answer"" button gets replaced by the ""Hang up and send a text message"" button when I'm taking it out of my pocket, etc.<p>All in all, I've been somewhat disappointed with the phone.",1281304561

So make sure you're not simply someone who does a very good job at executing project plans from other people.<p>Positions that are closer to the money in enterprise firms than ""very good Java software developer"" include:<p>* Architects who decide how very good developers should be writing code<p>* Product leads/managers who decide what very good developers should be writing in the first place<p>* Anybody involved in the software development process that has mastered the problem domain itself; so, for instance, if you're working on clearing software, you should be a world expert in clearing.<p>* People who come up with very good ideas for software projects that save or make money for the firm.<p>Things you can do to execute this:<p>* Try to move into an architecture role (be warned: this is what most devs try to do, so the law of supply and demand limits the upside here)<p>* Talk to your manager about what the next 3 steps are on the career path that ends with you managing a team, and then spend another 10 minutes talking about how to execute step 1 and have it recognized.<p>* Change groups you work on (say, from clearing to order management) and coincident to that move invest a month of diligent nighttime reading to become an expert in the problem domain of the new group, which gives you business value.<p>* Survey every project you've worked on so far for the company, make a list of 5 problems those projects had that cost the company money, come up with a solution to one of those problems that you can implement on your own (for instance, refactoring classes, or factoring out thorny configuration logic into Scala, or &c &c &c), and then talk to your manager about how you can demo that idea to the group.<p>The goal at the end of the day is to be in a position where, when you have the performance review, you can confidently put on the table a bunch of things you've done for the business. You'll know it when you've got the upper hand in negotiation; the company won't be able to afford losing you.<p>As much as ""become an architect!"" is a trap for enterprise devs, be aware that if money is your objective, ""go move to a software company!"" is <i>an even bigger trap</i>.

I don't think its worth focusing on having to be in one particular area of it, simply because everyone else is. You don't have to worry about traveling to/from the city until you're in Berkeley or Mountain View or elsewhere in the bay area. Worst case, you take a cab.

Its somewhat far away from SoMA (30-45m by muni + bart -- made this trip daily to go into the office, its not that bad).

1586246,comment,1583860,1586222,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The idea behind an ACL for such an attack is that the same hosts will be used over and over again, taken from a large pool of zombies. So, let's take your example of 100,000 bots, an ACL in the upstream router (as seen from the host) could be used to checked against to identify those packets from the zombies and discard them. After all, a single attack of all 100,000 bots at once will just bring the host to its knees for the time-out of the connections and then it will bounce back up again. So, to increase the effectiveness of the attack they reconnect after every lost connection asking for another resource. If they're smart they'll vary agent strings and other characteristics to make it hard to narrow down who is and who is not legit.<p>Initially you don't have much to go on during such an attack and packet filtering is a reasonably expensive operation when you want to do it for a large number of hosts. So the strategy is to route all the traffic destined for that particular host through a router that has ACLs that are large enough to hold the total IP list for the botnet that is attacking the host, as these IPs become identified.<p>You don't want to route <i>all</i> your traffic through there because then you'd have to do the relatively expensive filtering on all of the packets, even those not destined for that particular host.<p>Now if an attacker were targeting the hosting facility they could thwart this strategy by sending requests to a larger number of hosts in the network in order to make life much harder for the crew fighting the attack. After all, you can't partition the problem anymore in to a portion that is targeted to the host and 'normal' traffic, effectively all the traffic could be bot traffic or it could be normal traffic, for all the receiving hosts.<p>To be able to partition the problem into a smaller one where you can let say 90% or more of the traffic through unfiltered and only concentrate on the remaining 10% would make solving it a bit easier. On the other hand if the attackers are silly enough to re-use the same bots to attack different hosts they've actually given you a clue as to which IPs are bots.<p>I hope that makes sense :)",1281303706

The kids might not be reared right, but they are no longer in poverty.<p>The opponent of capitalism is also the cause of poverty. The opponent of capitalism is collectivism.

Notice how there were many postal services in the US and they were growing and competing and bettering themselvs until the US government decided to give itself a monopoly on first class mail delivery.

He refers to a .vim repo on Github that ""does some magic where [it] puts each plugin in its own directory under /~.vim/bundles/."" What he describes here is based on Tim Pope's Pathogen: basically a plugin to manage all other plugins. I've been using Pathogen for a bit now, and it's excellent. Another solution is Cornelius Lin's Vimana, which I've heard very good things about, but I haven't tried.

The fact that TextMate 2 is suffering serious second-system syndrome is undoubtedly a big part of why Vim is getting so much mindshare.<p>TextMate is an amazing editor, and in my (limited) experience, certainly one of the few in the last 2 decades to even attempt to challenge emacs/vim on their own turf (ie. lightweight powerful editors).  But ultimately I think a one-developer closed source model will never be able to create a third truly great editor.<p>The main factors driving me towards vim are maturity and general editing optimality.<p>Maturity because vim has been around and is open source, so millions of wrinkles have been ironed out: very few crashing bugs, good performance on large files, handles edge cases well and has settings for probably anything you'd ever need, etc.<p>Optimality because vi attempts to allow editing with the fewest number of keystrokes.  Becoming fluent in vi means that for any type of text editing you can make any desired change in a near optimal number of keystrokes.  It's a pretty safe bet that no one will ever come up with a more optimal editor for such a wide range of tasks.  Sure IDEs have a high local maxima, but they fall off quickly as you jump to files that fall outside known semantics.

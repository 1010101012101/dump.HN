I can't count the number of times I have bought and given away this book. Especially the translation done by Thomas Cleary. Cleary adds another text into the mix ""The Book of Family Traditions on the Art of War""  by Yagyu Munenori, a contemporary of Musashi, but from a very different circle, so you get a nice contrast, and I believe it shows you how simplicity wins(5 rings).

Kudos.<p>This is where even a cursory familiarity with the issues surrounding homelessness in your area would be greatly helpful. A huge portion of the homeless population has severe substance abuse problems and/or mental health issues. I highly doubt a bum is going to be spending his panhandling dollars on hookers, but alcohol and blow is more than likely. Given what I know of the proportions through volunteer work, it is entirely unsafe to by default assume a homeless person does not have significant substance abuse problems. Sadly, this is one part of the homeless stereotype that is rooted in reality.<p>This isn't to pass judgment, but rather to point out that if you really want to help people get off the streets for good, and bootstrap themselves out of poverty, you need to do a lot more than just give money. For a great many homeless people the cause of their homelessness is a lot more than just being down on their luck, it has to do with long-standing problems - substance abuse, toxic environment, and other negative influences. Giving money without resolving these other external issues will just exacerbate the problem.<p>And note that we're not talking about <i>poor people</i>, we're talking about the homeless. These are people who can't show up to an interview showered with a clean t-shirt - they are not at all like the ""merely"" poor. Do these guys make enough from panhandling to afford even a shitty room somewhere? Odds are, no, and that's pretty much a bare minimum requirement if your goal is to get off the streets, clean up, and get employed. I contribute to organizations that do this for this very reason - my money is doing much more good (heck, it's at least not doing bad) in the hands of professionals who are able to offer an environment where people have access to the help they need, and the stability to make lasting changes in their life.<p>And FYI, I'm contributing significant amounts of my money and time to this particular issue, a lot more than change most people give to the homeless in any given year. What are you doing about it?",1269902788

Phrases being changed, picture alignment, that kinda of thing.<p>Of course, in theory, A/B as the name implies is about testing two different approaches, so again, in theory, any stuff completely different can be seen as an experiment for A/B. The problem is that humans have been trying different ways to do things for a loooooooooong time, and the whole point of trying to teach and learn A/B is to test things, measure, and walk towards your goal.<p>So yes, you can ""A/B test"" two completely different things, but it will be so. much. harder to actually know what it worked.

One main reason for this is that functions can't (for now) take primitives as parameters, so all arithmetic is boxed unless it's done inline with explicit type hints. (Hence all the macros in the Clojure code.)<p>However, don't lose hope just yet. Languages like Haskell or OCaml, with more mature compilers, might not have such limitations. Also, I think that while many small examples might turn out essentially equivalent when comparing imperative and functional styles, the difference becomes more pronounced on a whole-program scale. Pure functions are easier to reason about, and compose better.<p>Fortran, C and C++ will probably keep their place as tools to use when absolute best performance is needed, but with modern compilers and virtual machines, functional languages do not have to be slow either.<p>Finally, I hope to see functional programming languages succeed simply because functional programming is a lot of fun.",1269900539

Recall that Stephen Hawking was told that 'every equation will drop sales by half.' But a lack of presented evidence doesn't imply that the thesis is wrong.<p>Once you look, you find that the theory corresponds much more nicely to reality than the theory of genius commonly held: namely, that early success is a good predictor of later, great works. From what I know of history, in mathematics, art, architecture, music, physics, leadership, hacking, dance, there truly are distinct examples of prodigies and late bloomers. And it's enlightening to hear how he describes the difference in creative approach. For example, when I was a kid, the <i>production</i> of my work was only a hindrance. I had a concept or idea or visualization that I wanted to communicate, and I would tell people, literally, that I wish only that I had 'a projector in my head'.<p>But many people, who's work I've come to respect deeply, rely instead on the resistance of their medium, the feedback of an audience, the taste of what they create, rely upon pursuing little accidents they stumble upon along the way as clues to help them find the form they seek. And I can tell just how different it is from a conceptual approach, and how patient and observant and diligent one must be to achieve its mastery.",1218146206

270047,comment,269850,269997,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Okay, folks, you drove me to the books -- or rather to the <i>Cooks Illustrated</i> website, which no self respecting geek who cooks should fail to subscribe to. They ran lots of knives through tests and recommended the Forschner Victorinox Fibrox Chef's Knife, which cost $25.33 in 2005.<p>So, I lied. You might not want to use a $20 knife. You shouldn't spend a penny less than $26. ;)<p>Note that this is a brand-name product. Wouldn't be surprised to see the no-brand version at a supply store for $19.<p>Note also that knives are a personal thing. If the cheap one doesn't fit your hand you'll want a more expensive one. C'est la vie.<p>It's true that keeping your knife sharp is really important. Unfortunately, you can dull an expensive knife as easily as a $25 knife. You should get a steel and try to figure out how to use it. You should get your knife sharpened when you sense it's getting dull, or you'll injure yourself. You should use the right cutting board. You should have a knife that's all your own and hide it from other people, lest they smash the edge into a solid metal object. You should watch Alton Brown's show about knives to learn these things.<p>Mr. Brown recommends pro sharpening because he thinks all the homegrown solutions suck by comparison. <i>Cook's Illustrated</i>, OTOH, recommends the $80 Chef's Choice 110 electric home sharpener, which you can afford with the money you saved on that $110 chef's knife.<p>Pro chefs carry more than one knife, in a case. You also need more than one, but not many more. In his book, Anthony Bourdain (famous pro chef) recommended a chef's knife, a flexible boning knife, a paring knife, and an offset serrated knife. Alton Brown (famous geek pro chef) also suggests kitchen shears and a 4 to 5 inch utility knife. <i>Cook's Illustrated</i> suggests that you might want a slicing knife if you carve a lot of roasts (alas, I don't; I married a vegetarian), or a cleaver if you often make homemade chicken stock (see above).<p>You'll also need some steak knives if you're not married to a vegetarian like I am. ;)",1218146031
270046,comment,269775,269893,0,0,time_management,,,"(Edited, 6:06 pm)<p>Good point, and it's probably reasonable to make statements like ""most integers are not prime"" or ""perfect numbers are very rare among the integers"". However, I'd still disagree with the use of percentages. For example, ""0% of integers"" are prime, in the sense that primes become arbitrarily sparse as N -> infinity, but primes clearly exist, which doesn't conform with our concept of ""0%"".<p>The set of even numbers intuitively seems to be ""50%"" the size of the integers, but they're actually sets of the same ""size"", because there is a bijection between them. So I'm not fully comfortable with saying ""50% of integers are even"" even though it's intuitively true. A lot of intuitively true things are false with infinite sets. For example, we generally assume commutativity of addition to the point that we might believe:<p>1/1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - 1/6 + ... = 
1/1 + 1/3 - 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/7 - 1/4 + ...,<p>because both sums contain the same terms, only in different order, and in finite sums we can rearrange terms in any way we wish. However, the sums converge to different values, and terms of such a sum (conditionally but not absolutely convergent) can be rearranged so as to converge to <i>any</i> real value.<p>However, we can both agree that the probability of choosing an even integer from {1..n} (or {-n..n}) -> 0.5 as n -> infinity.",1218145981

A CTO would have to deal with a lot less in sales/customer-service/etc. (I find a small dose of these fun, but couldn't tolerate them as >50% of my job.)<p>The extreme example of this is Steve Wozniak I think, who didn't even want to be top technical guy in his company; he just wanted to be an engineer.",1218145957

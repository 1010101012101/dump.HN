Of course you can click your chosen desktop in the indicator applet in the panel, and I'm sure there's a goofy key-combo that will do the same thing.  But having a super fast target 1080 pixels tall at each edge of the screen is unbeatable.  Application windows are always maximized, they never have to take turns sharing the same screen.<p>In Gnome2/Mate desktops, this switching action isn't built in, but available with the ""brightside-properties"" package.  Brightside-properties also worked on the early Ubuntu Netbook Remix, but since Unity/Gnome3 came along it doesn't work in those environments and I've found no way to make it happen.<p>Although Windows didn't do virtual desktops, at least they didn't stand in the way of OEMs making their own desktops.  My first pc was a Win95 Sony Vaio (200Mhz, 32MB RAM!) and Sony had some sort of desktop mask that would allow you to have a ridiculously huge desktop, like 4096^2, but it was windowed to whatever 800x600 section you felt like seeing at the time.  It rocked!  It's was better than what Gnome3/Unity have become now, 15 years later.",1352630794

So I go to download it, but the installer nicely tells me that this doesn't work on Windows 8, and I need to download another file instead. However, this is their pro product, which basically means it's filled with crap. It's a good thing I noticed the tiny Customize Installer button because otherwise it would have: Changed my home page, subscribed me to something called GeekBuddy, enrolled me to their cloud program, change my DNS servers, and sent information about each scan it does to the company. The same was true with many of the applications I installed, like Adobe Reader trying to install McAfee, or QuickTime trying to sign me up for offers.""</i><p>I hope Mark Shuttleworth might read and understand this paragraph before he continues to reduce the trust of Ubuntu users. The crucial difference between users of Windows/Apple on the one hand and GNU/Linux on the other is that Linux users <i>have choices</i> at the distribution level. A secondary advantage for GNU/Linux users is that once a distribution has been chosen, application software is packaged centrally with some degree of oversight so this kind of bait and switch by software vendors becomes harder.<p>The Ubuntunaughts at Canonical seem to be heading in the direction of <i>selecting</i> hardware which they can ensure will 'just work'.",1352629896

I have no idea if it is any better than your average peeler, but it works great for me ;) He has an amusing line if you only buy one - ""one for the man with no friends."" I think I'm going to buy a few of these and send them off to some ex-New Yorkers I know. They make great memorabilia for those in the know ;)",1227851502

I'd much rather be on an important team in a lesser-known company. By ""important"" I mean strategic to the business. Such projects tend to be a lot more satisfying, as well as more rational (assuming a basically functional environment). And the lessons they teach are better lessons.<p>I've noticed two things about less important projects in larger companies. One is that they often get killed before they have a chance to release or gain traction - and it doesn't much matter how successful they are. This is because they're starved for executive support. The other is that they tend to end up in technical ghettos, working on something that seems cool at the time but is divorced from users and the business, and so doesn't have much value.",1227851290

He has written much content on the human aspects of security useful to laymen.  He does so without being arrogant or saying ""I invented this"".  All in all, a good educator that doesn't talk down to his audience and can explain things so that his ""grandmother could understand"" (my favorite Einstein principle).  He has interwoven this practice into his business, the beneficiary of his self-promotion, which seems to have done well for him.<p>I might even recommend Schneier as the poster-boy of healthy entrepreneurial self-promotion.",1227851065

I propose a web-application to coordinate and schedule ""a vigil for suspicious activities"" by ordinary citizens across the country / world.<p>Detailed Explanation:
It was heart-breaking to see what happened in Mumbai. Although it is easy to blame the ""system"" for lack of ""intelligence"", it is simply not possible to believe that none of the citizens who were around the area where terrorists docked did not see them coming. Most probably someone who saw, did not think it was important enough to escalate to the police. (""Chalta Hai"" attitude).<p>Such incidents can be reduced, if ordinary citizens keep their eyes and ears open when they are out in public places doing their regular things and escalate them when something suspicious is seen.<p>What I propose is a web-application to organize and schedule a vigil whereby volunteers can opt-in to keep their ""eyes and ears open"" at a particular public place for a particular time-slot.<p>Other volunteers can see what places and time-slots are already covered and opt to vigil some other area / time-slot.<p>BTW not sure if this post is relevant in this forum. Sincere apologies if that is the case.<p>What do fellow hackers think about this idea?",1227850812

I spent about half an hour trying to figure out which accounts of mine are OpenID enabled, and to get the url for my ID.  I keep getting errors like ""Open ID server can't be found"", etc. so I imagine the urls that I'm putting in the sign up box are not the right ones.    Then when I finally get signed up and logged in, later I try to log in with the same url and I get an error.  Very frustrating.<p>Anyways, to summarize:  Open ID seems to suck, and its very confusing (though to be completely honest I'm a little drunk which might have made this more difficult for me).

379119,comment,378582,379038,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>complaining about the appropriate [use] of the word ""gay""</i><p>This is a fascinating one because that word is shifting again: ""gay"" increasingly means ""lame"" rather than ""homosexual"". What's fascinating is how this is happening even as society becomes more tolerant of homosexuality. Young people who use ""gay"" this way belong to probably the least homophobic generation ever, so the politically correct misreading of this shift is even more off-base than political correctness usually is.<p>The South Park guys captured this perfectly with their line, ""This is gayer than sex with men!""<p>All this by way of agreeing with you that the subtleties of language far surpass people's rigid attempts to nail them down. Incorrect usages that gain currency turn into correct usages. It's more interesting to observe and admire these shifts than to try to stop them (a fool's errand).<p>Edit: <i>Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man. </i> - Heidegger",1227850142

379111,story,,,22,33,bkrausz,"Ask HN: Boston or Silicon Valley?",,"So I'm graduating in May and have a couple of great offers from places in both Boston and the Valley.  I've interned in SV twice and love it.  This is both a pro and a con in that I know the place well, but at the same time I'd love to try some place different and diversify a little.  I intend to start a business at some point in the future, and as such imagine I'll eventually move to SV.  Here's my pro-con list:<p><pre><code>  SV Pros:
  - Gorgeous weather
  - Amazing networking opportunities

  Boston Pros:
  - Closer to home (I'm from NY)
  - Cheaper
  - More diverse (less disjoint with reality)
</code></pre>
Before I start a flame war over my last Boston pro: while I love the valley, I sometimes feel like it's disjoint with reality in terms of how people act towards technology.  It's a nerd's haven and often awesome, but mildly unnerving at times and lacks some diversity.<p>Anyway, I'd appreciate some advice as to where to go given equal offers (factoring in cost of living to a reasonable extent).  Additionally I'd like some clarification on a few things to help make a more informed decision:<p>- Is Boston significantly cheaper than SV (I'd probably be in the Mountain View area)?  It's hard to find comparable areas for cost of apartments and such.<p>- What's the startup scene like in Boston?  I hear it's a great place for a software startup, but how does it compare to the Valley in terms of opportunities and networking?<p>- Any advice on which of two hypothetical is better: big fish little pond or little fish big pond?  Alternatively, would you rather be at an important team in a lesser-known company, or a less-important team in a well-known company?<p>- Any other factors I should be taking into account?  I'm looking closely at what I'd be doing, what my potential employers' non-competes look like, and how open the companies are.  One company is a private open-source company, and the other is a company of about the same size owned by a public company.<p>This is a really tough decision, and any advice would be really appreciated.<p>Thanks!",1227849263

Even if your perspective is purely the negative, things could be far far worse.  I think it is easy in our pursuit of the ideal to tend to see things as what is wrong rather than how much is right.

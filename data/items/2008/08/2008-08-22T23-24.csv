284336,comment,284205,284205,0,0,sokoloff,,,"I have to say that ""graduated from MIT"" is far more impressive to potential employers, investors and co-founders than is warranted, IMO. And I say this as an MIT grad. :) Being no dummy, I dig through my nightstand to find and wear my brass rat (MIT class ring) approximately once every 5 years, when I need a better shot at one of those things. Otherwise, no one I know cares, though half of our top technical leaders are from MIT.<p>I also look at the recruiting efforts my current company (startup in early 200x, now decidedly not-startupy, public, and $500+K in annual revenue): we bias heavily towards ""top"" CS schools when doing college recruiting. We've gotten some absolutely fabulous candidates from ""second tier"" schools and we naturally recruit there every year, but if you come from MIT, you get a full 25% (estimated) better chance right from the start of the interview.<p>For my own account (plural of anecdote not being data notwithstanding), despite being a pretty strong candidate, I strongly suspect that my current lot in life is based more than 50% on my attending (and not even spectacular results at) MIT, and as a result, I give heartily every time they call for alumni donations.<p>Employers and founders: MIT isn't all that special. So called ""second tier"" schools also have some extremely capable potential employees, and individual talent, motivation and drive is FAR more important.<p>High-school students: If you have the choice between MIT and $200K in debt and a state school with a full ride, and you're pretty sure you're going to work in engineering for 20 years, definitely go to MIT. Right or wrong, that name opens doors, and I believe I've done a lot more interesting and lucrative work than I'd have been able to do from the full ride I had offered to me at UMCP.<p>As an MIT grad, I'm a lot less impressed with the brass rat than most people who are in a position to help shape your lot in life. If you're going to found 5 startups in the hopes that one will be a solid success, save the $200K and invest it in your startups. If you're going to go work for someone else, even just for a while, you'll have no problem paying off your student loans from MIT, or any other top school, IME.",1219449461

If you're building a business website with the <i>only</i> monetization option available being ads, then <i>of course</i> you're going to turn on ads.

While I was going to chime in on the side of ""start with ads, because adding them later just pisses people off"".  But I'm also of the opinion that early stage sites should have minimal ad clutter.  Find out what you have to do to make the site pay before you decide to pile them on.  One ad spot is probably a good starting point.<p>You may already be saying you're going to experiment rather than pile them all on at once--but I can't be sure from your comment, so I thought it worth adding.",1219449050

But by doing so, they'd get fewer recurring revenues, which means that the price of the printer itself would have to go up.<p>Either that, or they lose out on profits.<p>You wouldn't be angry if the toner contained less fuel. If you could print only 2000 pages instead of 3000, you would think you got a great deal. But if you can print 2000 pages, and the printer then refuses to print the last 1000, you're suddenly upset? Makes no sense. You're still getting essentially the same deal: 2000 pages for $60.",1219448937

To me ruby feels Turtles all the way down with respect to Objects, but some kind of nightmare tunnel of interleaved beasts down with Functions.<p>I don't think I should have to make that compromise, so I'll happily go about writing my ruby when I have to, but I'm waiting for the language that is consistent all the way down.<p>If I could replace every yield I've ever written in ruby with a .call() I would be so much happier :)",1219448838

First the mainstream media convinces you that you are a loser by showing people younger and dumber than you having more money. Once you go into the loser phase, some smart idiot who has inherited millions of dollars, who has never seen poverty writes a book which teaches you how to get rich. Are we humans so naive now that we have started reading books which teach us how to become rich.<p>I don't know how you become rich and also i am pretty much sure Bill Gates or Warren Buffett can't you teach you that too(mainly because there was lot of chance or randomness involved in their richness).

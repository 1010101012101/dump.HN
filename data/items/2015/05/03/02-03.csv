9479621,comment,9478906,9479494,0,0,x0x0,,,"True story of how an interview exploded for me:<p>I&#x27;m asked to code a simple matrix in java.  I ask about the fill factor, and get told quite low.  The constructor takes the dimension and it&#x27;s assumed square.  I ask the interviewer if a csc matrix is ok, and he kind of says he&#x27;s not sure what a csc matrix is.  I tell him it&#x27;s column sparse, and proceed to quickly write out, on a whiteboard, a simple csc matrix -- basically, an array of dimension columns of ArrayList of tuple <index, value>.  The constructor is pretty much<p><pre><code>   ArrayList<Tuple>[] columns;\n   void SparseCSCMatrix(int dim){\n      columns = new ArrayList<Tuple>[ dim ];\n   }       \n</code></pre>\nThe interviewer then starts going at me because having, eg, a million columns requires an array with a million elements in it.  I say yes, duh.  He says it&#x27;s quite inefficient -- what if I only use 10 columns out of the million?  My response is, well, that&#x27;s fine -- but what you&#x27;re describing isn&#x27;t a matrix.  It turns out that what he really wanted was a HashMap from tuple: (x idx, y idx) to value, and that a typical load would be perhaps 1k elements in a space of 1 million by 1 million.<p>We then go at it about whether I should have asked him to clarify, and I basically decide I don&#x27;t have to play along with stupid gotcha questions so I told him <i>words have meanings</i> and a &quot;matrix&quot; with only 10 non-empty columns <i>is not a matrix</i>.  And I don&#x27;t have time for wankers.<p>At least I learned what they were like fast...",1430621867

9479617,comment,9473519,9478923,0,0,underwater,,,"Yes, that&#x27;s a tricky problem. Generally GraphQL solves it by filtering on the server. You&#x27;d request something like `friends(age: 25, order: dob, first: 10) { name, profilePicture }` and pass that straight through to the UI.<p>There are some situations where this doesn&#x27;t work to well. For search suggestions, for example, you might not want to request `searchSuggestion(query: &quot;Tom Smi&quot;) { <lots of data> }` on every keystroke because sequential queries will have a lot of duplication. In this case we can just fetch the IDs of the results and do a separate query to fetch the data for the people that we don&#x27;t know about yet.<p>Having the server know about client queries (and therefore preemptively running queries) is something we specifically avoided with GraphQL. If the server knows what the client wants then sending any query across the wire doesn&#x27;t make sense at all. It also falls down if data requirements client changes across client versions. You quickly end up in a place where the server has to know about all possible client queries, which is complex difficult to maintain.",1430621837

9479615,comment,9479513,9479513,0,0,Orangeair,,,"Honestly, as it currently stands, Java appears to me as merely a pared down version of C#. C# shares nearly all of the same major features, while adding in more useful ones like properties and Linq, plus the promise of many new features on the horizon, like the null propagating operator. All of those, plus the rest of Microsoft&#x27;s development ecosystem,  make it a much nicer language overall.<p>The only reason I don&#x27;t think C# has taken over Java yet is because of how entrenched Java is, and it&#x27;s wide cross-platform support. With mono, Silverlight, and Microsoft&#x27;s newfound love for open-sourcing however, I think those arguments would be pretty much null if Java were to be introduced today.",1430621781

9479612,comment,9477747,9477747,0,0,cge,,,"I&#x27;m interested to know what the authors think about the problem that could be called vote splitting or support buying, which would be akin to vote buying in one-person-one-vote system. This seems particularly relevant because, unlike most systems, buying the support of small numbers of voters could be useful.<p>Consider the case given elsewhere in this thread of 10,000 voters willing to pay only $1 against a proposal, and a single supporter. That supporter would need to pay over $100m for the measure to pass, giving each person against it at least $10,000.<p>Now suppose that person takes their $100m, and only purchases $25m worth of votes. They find someone else, and transfer $35m to them with the agreement that the person will buy $25m in votes, and keep the remaining $10m. A person who is only willing to vote $1 against a measure is unlikely to turn down such a deal, but it saves the lone supporter $40m.<p>It seems like it would be very difficult to police this, as the transfers would not necessarily need to be direct. For example, verbal agreements between the one wealthy, lone supporter and nine opponents that those opponents would get contracts in the future worth $1m each would be hard to notice, but would save the supporter $90m. An employer could give bonuses vaguely tied to the success or failure of a measure, and so on. And in all of these cases, the savings are so extreme that vast amounts could be spent hiding the fraud.<p>Even <i>without</i> buying the votes of opponents, it can be very beneficial for wealthy, motivated supporters to transfer money for voting to poorer or less motivated supporters, to move closer to the optimal funds arrangement (all amounts equal). In some cases, this could be almost indistinguishable from legitimate behavior, and would lead to all sorts of claims: is a philanthropist giving money to the poor to help them live, or to support her social agenda?<p>In a one-person-one-vote system, buying the votes of individuals requires mass fraud to have an impact. In QV, however, every doubling in size of a group that votes optimally doubles the number of votes they can buy at the same total cost. Thus it seems like small,  motivated groups have a very, very large motivation toward fraud, while that fraud could take place at an extremely small level that would be difficult to detect. This doesn&#x27;t even need to be organized: it makes sense for even a single motivated supporter to go out on their own and split their vote with one other person, perhaps a close friend of theirs.",1430621750

I understand that you need to get insight into the skill of the candidate but forcing her to work on an editor she does not know, giving limited time etc. is probably not the best way to get that.  I used to interview software engineers for a big company and we usually gave them a problem that they could solve in 48 hours using anything they want (internet, library etc.) and we just asked them to explain their solution in person during the final round of interviews.

In Norway police may strike, but only subject to very strict limits on when and how, and with the caveat that the government may at any time declare a continued strike illegal - only a few other groups (military, essential hospital staff and similar) are subject to similarly strict regulation of strikes.<p>The limited strike right is often used as an invitation to substantially limit these unions influence.",1430620462
9479554,comment,9479303,9479410,0,0,alexqgb,,,"There may be a growing awareness that police unions are not like other unions.<p>Historically, American cops were used to violently break up strikes, so their fraternal orders have never been seen by other unions as trusted members of the same cause. Quite the contrary. And while the resulting animosity may have diminished in recent decades, police unions are still viewed by other unions as a thing apart. Given the increasingly visible role of police unions in backstopping egregious behavior, current events are extending this view to a broader segment of the public.<p>Indeed, what&#x27;s becoming clear is that while the standard concerns of unions are shared by police unions  (working conditions, pay, etc.), they also serve a more fundamental purpose that&#x27;s unique to law enforcement; shielding their members from legal accountability for acts of violence committed against the public.<p>Unfortunately, this is not an entirely unreasonable thing for them to demand. In essence, they&#x27;re expected to do a lot of the dirty work demanded by those in power. And by &quot;dirty&quot; I mean fundamentally disrespectful of people&#x27;s basic rights. To the extent that an establishment is supported by the general public, special protections for the heavies are unnecessary. But the moment sentiment turns against them, the cops know full well that they&#x27;ll be hung out to dry - even if their abuses were an unavoidable result of following specific orders (e.g., meeting quotas for arrests, prosecuting the drug war, growing department budgets via dubious asset forfeitures, etc.)<p>This use &#x27;em and abuse &#x27;em approach to outsourcing violence is not a new phenomena. In fact, the situation that police unions exist to protect their members against was detailed by Niccolo Machiavelli in 16th century, when he provided an account of Cesare Borgia, who was unburdened by heavy scruples, and Remirro de Orco, a brutal but useful man for whom things ended very badly.<p><a href=""http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/churchhistory220/Lecture13/PrinceCesareBorgia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/churchhistory220/Lecture13...</a>",1430620417

Police need to concentrate on de-escalating problems whenever possible, even allowing suspects to get away when the alternative is using deadly force. (Presuming, of course, that the suspect isn&#x27;t an immediate threat to the public.)<p>Take for example the recent shooting in South Carolina, where a policeman shot a man who was running away from a traffic stop. He could have just let the guy go.<p>Ferguson is another example. The officer said he feared for his life and that&#x27;s why he shot Michael Brown. The officer was in a running police vehicle at the time. Why did he not simply drive away? A quick stab of the accelerator and you&#x27;re at a safe distance where you can take a moment to figure out what to do next.<p>There was a recent incident in Virginia where a 17-year-old refused to get out of a car during a traffic stop, believing he had the right to have his parents present before interacting with the police. The police tried to force him out, which he resisted, and now he&#x27;s naturally being charged with assaulting the police. Why could they not simply either get his parents as requested, or wait him out?<p>Take Eric Garner. He pushed away attempts to handcuff him, at which point the police put him in a choke hold and pushed him to the ground, which killed him. Why not talk to him first?<p>It seems like almost every incident where police misconduct gets national attention could be solved if the police had been willing to simply <i>stop</i> and have a little patience when dealing with problems.<p>I&#x27;m uncomfortable with things like rubber bullets and bean bags, because they perpetuate the idea that force is a reasonable first resort for the police to use when dealing with trouble. They&#x27;re also not guaranteed to be non-lethal; used on the wrong person, or just get an unlucky shot, and the target can still end up dead. We&#x27;re seeing the same stuff in play right now with tasers. They were supposed to be a way for police to subdue people without killing them in situations where they would have previously had to resort to a gun. Instead, they&#x27;re being used to subdue people when deadly force is not at all justified, simply because it&#x27;s convenient for the police to stun people into submission. Every so often they tase somebody with a heart condition or something and kill them even though they posed no threat.",1430619242

I conduct executive checkups fairly regularly, but i’m not promoting anything here. I just want to share a personal philosophy that you, as a patient, could adopt to reduce risk.<p>Firstly, it should be stated that the utility and performance of any diagnostic test that has a binary outcome (eg. diseased/healthy) depends on 1) its intrinsic test characteristics 2) the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested[1], 3) the available diagnostic/treatment options for positive people, and 4) the threshold chosen to call something ‘positive’ since you are virtually always measuring a continuous variable.<p>People talk about false positives often, but you should know that there is some room for judgement here. The typical threshold for PSA has historically been 4.0 ng/mL. Above this is considered a positive screen, and you are recommended further testing to confirm prostate cancer, which can be invasive and lead to complications (bleeding, nerve damage, etc). This kind of two-stage testing is a common theme. The issue is that PSA values in people with cancer and people without cancer are normally distributed and have some overlap. A value of 4.0 is in the overlap zone, and the vast majority of people with 4.0 will <i>not</i> have cancer. However, lets say hypothetically that guidelines changed and we now use 20. At this level, most people who test positive probably have something bad, and the risk:benefit ratio is in favor of confirmatory testing and probably in favor of treatment too. I won’t bother going into it, but there’s a fair amount of liability, psychology and economics at play when choosing thresholds. Biochemical tests like PSA do have some variance, but are mostly reliable. It’s more complicated with imaging and amorphous things like mammograms that have some operator variability in judgement (and hence more liability).<p>This was a long-winded way to say that <i>information</i> is not necessarily bad, but it’s what you and your doctor choose to do with it. There’s room for discussing probabilities, and the various available pathways. <i>Trust</i> is huge. Your doctor will act in your best interests when he feels safe from lawsuits, otherwise he&#x27;ll be focused on not missing anything regardless of likelihood or cost. The financial misalignment of our system doesn’t help in building trust either. Most first-stage screening tests have very minimal risk involved. Things like checking your blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, doing a treadmill stress test, reviewing your meds, vaccinations, etc which are part of these annual checkup programs are, on balance, usually good ideas.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity</a>",1430618997

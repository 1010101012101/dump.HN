But how many offices use substantial amounts of paper entirely internally any more?<p>Just to add to the data points: nearly every large engineering firm, or any utility (power/water/O&G/etc.) with an engineering capability. Most drawings are still printed for markup/review, and many are issued as hard copies to be retained on-site (within switchrooms, cabinets, etc).",1449197997
10674326,comment,10667180,10674139,0,0,illumen,,,"A parallel PCLMULQDQ version is faster than a serial CRC32. Because CRC32 has a latency of 3 cycles.<p>A parallel CRC32 can be slightly faster with more data segment used, and more code size.<p>Also PCLMULQDQ can use an polynomial I think. So they could make a compatible version.<p>The lookup table version they used has to have used lots more CPU cache. Also, I would suggest they look at reducing the amount of times they call the function. Since there are two ways to speed up functions that are called a lot. One is to stop calling it so many times.<p>Or since IO is limiting, they could consider compressing/decompressing the data as well. Using something fast like LZ4 compression. This will give them faster IO and a checksum at the same time. Something like Blosc can be faster than memcpy. Especially since the data is replicated over the network as well, and they would save space on their storage.<p>Modern CPU performance optimization is very often about memory IO. If the data is in L2/L3 then you can do a LOT of computation on it, almost for free, compared to the time it takes to get it into L2/L3.<p>During that time waiting for memory/disk/network IO, they might consider other things. Like indexing, better checksums (like SHA1) or even encryption. Especially if the data is already in L2/L3.",1449197970

Crc32 was in sse4.2, so Nehalem.<p>The crc32 instruction is hard to beat, has been around for years, and I would guess the different poly could be phased in on their systems like you would for changing a password algorithm, or just try the new poly since it is quick, and if it fails use the old poly.",1449197941

No doubt it will be treated as a disregarded entity for federal tax purposes. So, gifting shares to an LLC is not a taxable event. If the LLC sells shares for a non-charitable purpose (e.g. lobbying, or funding commercial ventures), then sure, that will be taxable. But if it in turn donates shares to either a private foundation or another charity, in that case, it will not be taxable, and will in fact be deductible for the Zucks.<p>Basically, if the Zucks own the LLC, then until funds actually leave the LLC they really haven&#x27;t made a donation at all.",1449197900

10674292,comment,10670138,10670729,0,0,grayclhn,,,"I work on research close to this area -- time series w/ macro applications, but not on these specific models. These specific models are very very important for estimating the effects of monetary policy decisions, forecasting, etc. because they embed a fair bit of economic theory with a decent amount of estimation theory so that the models can address questions about &quot;causality&quot; in a meaningful way: if I intervene by changing the interest rate, what is the distribution of outcomes that will result. (The stuff I work on uses less economic theory so it can&#x27;t address those questions.)<p>That&#x27;s not to say that the NY Fed takes the model&#x27;s recommendations uncritically and assumes that the models are perfect or the recommendations are the truth, because that would be nuts. Just that this class of models is one of the few ways to use &quot;the data&quot; to provide guidance about policy decisions.<p>The people who&#x27;ve developed the NY Fed&#x27;s DSGE model are some of the absolute top people working on these models. It&#x27;s based on a lot of academic research and a lot of research published in top journals by people at the NY Fed involved in building the model. Other banks have their own models, but I suspect this one is the highest profile. (Again, not precisely my field of research, so I could be missing one or two.)<p>So, to get around to answering your question. For academic research in economics, this is as &quot;production level&quot; as it gets. Is this the same as using Julia for algorithmic trading? No. The NY Fed&#x27;s not running this model in real time, and if something crashes then they can restart it. But I think this is huge for Julia&#x27;s adoption in economic research.<p>(For a pdf with more about the modeling strategy itself:\n<a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr647.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff...</a>\nbut that is 2 years old now.)",1449197507

It&#x27;s a form of censorship but it has worked, streaking is very rare at sports events nowadays.<p>I think the same effect could work for mass shootings, If all the media organizations refused to broadcast any info about mass shootings it would probably reduce the number of incidents. Unfortunately it seems unlikely that the news industry as a whole would collaborate and agree to censor themselves in this way, especially since there is a legitimate public danger while the incident is ongoing. Government is prohibited by the constitution from getting involved in media censorship so it would have to be done by the media companies themselves.

10674272,comment,10667634,10667634,0,0,EvanPlaice,,,"&quot;I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.&quot;\n- Law of the Instrument<p>All Economists are universally indoctrinated into the same basic classical theories of economics. Using inaccurate mathematical models and pseudo-math to map the world as one big series of supply/demand curves.<p>What&#x27;s worse. They delude themselves into believing there&#x27;s a divergence of thought by using Keynes vs Smith as counter-examples. There&#x27;s no divergence, both schools of thought are minor variations of the same basic fundamental concepts. Economic theory is -- and has been -- stunted for decades by Ivory Tower theorists who gave up on self-reflection decades ago.<p>Supply/demand do a decent job of mapping basic short-term fiscal trends at the expense of evaluating the impact of long-term trends and/or secondary/tertiary influences.<p>For example. If immigration limits were eliminated, logic dictates that high skilled labor would migrate en masse to developing countries with a low cost of living. ie maximize profit gains by reducing costs of living.<p>In reality high-skilled laborers act contrary to Econ theory. The vast majority of individuals who earn enough to cover their costs + future savings are more likely to migrate to western countries where they have a less purchasing power.<p>Social stability and professional opportunity present a value that transcends the assumptions of traditional Econ theory. It requires a long-term sociological investment (ie measured in centuries) to stabilize a multi-cultural society enough to break down the barriers of tribalism, xenophobia, caste, prejudice, etc.<p>Economists love to argue that the US recovered from the Great Depression due to the increase in industrialization following WWII. I&#x27;d argue that the US became an international super power because of the massive number of high-skilled exiles who migrated the US in search of safety/stability.<p>Decreasing the limits on immigration will only increase the &#x27;brain drain&#x27; from developing countries. Further stunting their growth and competitive standing in the international community.<p>On the lower-skilled end of the spectrum, people who can&#x27;t match the high standard of intelligence/talent will be priced out. For instance, I currently live in San Diego not far from the border with Mexico.<p>Most low-skilled Mexicans that move here either: permanently survive with a lower standard of living (ie for at least a generation); live here temporarily and send money back to their family in Mexico; or commute across the border temporarily for work.<p>I have a lot of respect those who sacrifice to stay permanently. The rest live a parasitic, transient existence. It&#x27;s sad to see but I can&#x27;t really blame them. Mexico is an unsafe, destitute, overpopulated, shithole; run rampant with corruption and extreme economic inequality. Given the choice, I&#x27;d probably do the same.<p>Illegal immigration doesn&#x27;t hurt the US. We receive an abundance of cheap labor freeing up citizens to pursue higher-skilled professions or work in privileged positions managing low-skilled laborers. It hurts Mexico because -- by subsidizing their failing socio-economic structure -- we&#x27;re delaying the inevitable watershed effect that would happen when a poverty-stricken populace is absent any alternative.<p>Instead of addressing the corruption, restructuring the government, and focusing on developing policies that lead to a more safe/stable society; Mexico defaults to a public policy of blaming the US for all of their problems while exporting their poorest/underprivileged underclass as cheap labor to the US.<p>The most intelligent and/or hardest working of those stay in the US, raise kids who are born naturalized citizens, receive a good education, rise above low-skilled labor, and prosper bringing more long-term benefit to the US overall.<p>The rest go as the wind blows. When the US economy contracts, opportunities for low-skilled laborers (ie construction, landscaping, etc) are cut and they immigrate back go Mexico.<p>The hidden impact from looser immigration laws is the potential for overpopulation. It&#x27;s no good for anybody when a populace increases in size dramatically over a short period of time. Cultural stability depends on some semblance of identity.",1449197276

All this massively diminished Sun and Java&#x27;s influence in enterprise systems, and caused the sales of expensive specialized hardware like SPARC to plunge.",1449194769

Worse, there is not necessarily negative consequences that would push the market to avoid such situation. For heavily polluted sites like gas station, chemical plant, ... the owner of the land has generally made a profit, so disposable land is a viable business model. Not even counting that after enough years, the site could <i>look</i> clean enough to be resold.<p>At some point, it was discussed in Europe to impose a viable (i.e. funded upfront) reconversion plan for land used for stuff like gas station or landfill.

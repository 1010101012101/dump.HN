In feather dancing, a male (performer) can deliver to the observer (fertile female) great beauty and wonder. Through the right dance pattern, a window into the very fabric of the universe can be opened. Proper feather color is one of those things that makes us distinct from other animals and humans; to encounter, to appreciate and to experience peacock's tails is to more intimately apprehend what it means to be a peacock.""",1283057773

1643178,comment,1641713,1642716,0,0,jdietrich,,,"I can only speak of Japan, I'm biased all to fuck and I'm making crass generalisations, but my essential objection to their education system is that I've never seen a truly creative solution from a Japanese worker. If you need a lab tech or an equation plugger, the Japanese are great. If you need to make something 12% lighter or 8% more aerodynamic, they should be top of your list. If you need anything more than steady, incremental improvement, give up.<p>The Japanese make great hardware but abysmal software. To use a martial metaphor, they make terrific soldiers but appalling generals. They have been taught that in order to excel, they simply need to memorise the 'correct' way of doing things and then follow that prescription with maximum effort. Young Japanese dearly <i>want</i> to be creative, but by and large they are simply unequipped to do so. Some manage it, but most end up as shachiku (literally ""corporate livestock"") clogging up the innards of some vast corporation.<p>There are myriad social and cultural factors at work of which the use of kanji is just a tiny part, but Japan is in a truly dire predicament. We all know the massive demographic problems facing Japan, but the shocking part is the complete inability of the Japanese to seriously address the issue. The current trend in Japan of using robotics in elder care is a good example - it seems innovative, but in my opinion is a symptom of a factory-bound mindset that has no problem-solving strategy other than ""fix it with engineering"". Japan desperately needs immigrants in vast numbers, but is simply unwilling to do anything at all in order to accommodate them. To return to kanji, it is currently practically impossible for foreign nurses to get residence in Japan due to a language test which only three out of 1,112 candidates have passed - <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/27/AR2010072706053.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07...</a><p>Education in my native Britain has rather gone to pot recently, but in defence of my home country we do have something of a track record of, well, inventing and discovering nearly everything.

While I acknowledge that I as the user must give permission for the application to access different kinds of information, FB also changes their privacy terminology/definitions and user agreements too often for me to feel safe about it. While I'm confident FB themselves won't sell users' data to third parties because it's not worth it to them from a risk/reward standpoint, I can't be sure about smaller websites who'd be capable of getting away with it if sneaky enough.<p>One last thing: I think it's important to note that I honestly wouldn't even look at what information is being requested. I would just hit the back button if FB Connect were required. If others are the same, that's a big barrier to have. But I think I've seen sites immediately jump to the permission request stage, which would eliminate that barrier. If the user is reading the request where they otherwise wouldn't, your overall stats will be much improved. (Maybe you're already doing that. If so, just ignore me and my ramblings.

Under options you can also enter the last 4 digits of the recipients phone number for added security. But it's not necessarily meant as a way to keep people out, if thats what you want to do you can always set a much longer password.",1283055695

So you don't have to believe my words- when you click to login you'll see that the only information requested is just your basic profile information. Nothing else.<p>Regarding FB having a profile, I don't quite understand this. For one, FB doesn't know what you're doing on my site. All it knows is that you signed into my site. But Facebook can't really ""do"" anything with that info. It can't post on your wall that you logged into my site, it doesn't have access to any of your activity on my site, etc.<p>Thanks for the good wishes.

I have a small studio. If I was faced with paying let's say a reasonable $120/yr fee for this service, I am pretty sure I would just lay out $120 for a backup drive instead. So for the sole songwriter with technical abilities (needed to use electronic music production software like DAWs) it's questionable. Now for the collaborative job, yeah, I can see that working. It's a big hassle to keep tracks synchronized with what other people are doing, so if done right there could be a demand for this. The cost of getting it done right might be prohibitory though. The first thing that will happen is the FL guy wants compatibility with the Cubase guy wants compatibility with the ProTools guy, which is a bigger problem.<p>Looking at the actual pricing plans, $228/yr for the medium 20G plan. 20G doesn't go far in my studio, so this wouldn't work very well as a long term backup/version control system, it would only be useful for collaboration of a few projects at a time and then I'd have to dump projects.<p>The $1068/yr plan is just too much for me to pay for 100G storage. I can rent a dedicated server with 2TB storage for less than that. Also even 100G doesn't hold my projects from the last six months.<p>I think it's the cost of providing bandwidth and storage for this stuff, it's a serious challenge to the viability of this startup. What you have sounds cool and I bet it works really well, but the file size issue and the cost, man oh man.",1283054686

4876229,comment,4875523,4875822,1,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"If they stick to technical specifications in the spirit of RFCs I will be silently content but this is the UN we're talking about not the IETF, and I am too old for closed-room negotiations that directly affect me (and everyone). Any technical standards proposed by the ITU can and should be written by the technical community and industry participants in an open manner, as everyone has come to expect.<p>Telephone traffic is also, ironically, a pretty small part of global Internet traffic now so I would paint this more like a power-grab from an organization hanging off the cliff of irrelevance. Telephone-like billing and regulatory models, for example, are simply not applicable to the Internet. <i>At the same time, there is a huge potential for this to be the place that anonymity on the net is simply outlawed</i>, for example.<p>Seriously discussing ""global Internet policy"" legitimizes the creation of a single lever that can be pulled to manipulate the whole world's ability to communicate, and that is way too much power -- even (some would say especially) for the UN. IMHO, the Internet should be deaf dumb and blind and keep on switching packets really really fast; there should be nothing to break or bicker about, and we can all get on with things. It's obviously going to be tempting though, and that's what all the posturing is about. But even well-intentioned proposals (surely standards are ""a good thing (TM)""!) simply foster the idea that it is appropriate to centralize that power. IMHO, we need to stop that sentiment before it congeals and formalizes into a World Government.<p>Historically, people have been able to ignore the IETF, etc, when they ""get it wrong."" The problem with a UN group, or any government, trying to serve a similar purpose is you have to work really hard (sometimes with force) to dismiss a terrible idea -- for example: global censorship, brought about by a simple prescriptive ""standard"" that enabled it. (This mirrors some of the debate around Canada's snooping bill -- for example, I believe our core networks shouldn't even support government spying, thats the RCMP's job to budget for, and they damn well better have all the right the warrants to actually snoop.)<p>IMHO, with government, less is usually more.<p>There is also a more general conflict at work here: it's easy to confuse leadership with ""directing"" rather than ""facilitating."" The former leads to dictatorships (ever had a boss hold a meeting and not ask for feedback?) and that's the impression I'm getting here, while the latter has been the source of IETF's and the W3C's, etc's, successful roles in ""governing"" the Internet. The Internet's governance so-far has basically been de-facto based on technical successes (the word meritocracy feels loosely applicable). Reading RFCs is like reading source code and it makes me feel the closest thing to patriotism that I can as a member of the Internet and the F/OSS community (and a bit of a techno-anarchist).<p>So yeah, it's wincing to see the Internet at the center of yet another closed-room power grab.",1354715929

The complication, of course, are Chinese telecoms that are there, money in hand, perfectly contented to pay those fees.<p>Anyway... that's just one drawback I can think up off the top of my head.

People invariably suffer from corruption, in particular, those in power. The less they are capable of, the safer everyone is. Governments and corporations have done orders of magnitude more harm than smaller entities like gangs (though from an absolute perspective, the separation between a gang and a government is mostly ontological). The criminals are (for the most part) not the ones we should be worrying about.<p>The legal system we currently have is broken at best and dangerous at worst. Many people have no faith in it's ability to be just or balanced. There are concrete reasons for harboring a distrust of the judicial system, e.g. <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=lunchtime-leniency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=lunchtime-l...</a><p>Not to mention that the judicial system is 'dumb' in the sense that it's primary goal is to enforce laws, not to improve society. Having a machine which processes instructions in this way and which simultaneously has the power to ruin someone's life is a bad idea by all metrics. Those two goals (enforcing the law and improving people's wellbeing) are commonly at odds due to the nature of how human societies function and how politics influence things which they ought not to.<p>The prison system also fares badly when it comes to solving problems - the reoffending rates are extremely high in many places - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism#Recidivism_rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism#Recidivism_rates</a><p>So how can anyone take this joke of a system seriously and expect it to be capable of policing itself when emotion is so deeply embedded in the judgements and actions it yields? The judge's decisions are emotional. The system as a whole is crafted out of an inability to deal with emotion (i.e. prisons being primarily revenge mechanisms as opposed to institutions which help people to stop being violent against others).<p>This is the bigger picture of the situation we find ourselves in. IMO, adding to the arsonal of weapons which this system has access to will serve to cripple, not improve society. In other words, this is all counter-productive and does not take the reality of human nature into account. It is an idealistic perspective.",1354714604

Say it has gone up 100x, and we get a nice round number of 10 TB disk space needed per second.<p>We know, thanks to XCD, that 7523 hard drives per second is created by the storage industry (globally, a total of 650 million drives per year). Say that the average storage space is over the last 5 years, around 500GB.<p>That mean, so long NSA buy's 0.265% of all hard drives produced each year, they will have enough hard drives to record all data transmitted inside the US borders.<p>They would still need to write the data. One obvious way would be to store it on site, and transport the drives to a central place. Drives are not big, but it is a noticeable work, so if people were doing this, there should be more verifiable proof of it. If we include post-storage compression, finding duplicates and any other tricks, the numbers should be able to be lowered by 50-75% or so, and might be enough to send some through the wire and only the overflow through drives loaded onto trucks.<p>One could also ask what 0.265% of the storage industry output is in raw cash.

The advantage of Greek letters is that they don't collide with normal variables, you can use short (1 letter) names for symbols. That is also the advantage of using special characters for number (and not using something like a->1, b->2, ...).<p>An additional problem is that some letter has an expected behavior, for example \\epsilon usually is small, and M (capital M) usually is a big number, p is a prime number and z is usually a complex number. The problem is not that they are Greek letters, the problem is that you have to learn the expected behavior. (It's like using i for a counter in a for loop. Obviously i is integer.)<p>The problem with the syntax is that mathematicians (and humans in general) are too good parsing DSL (domain specific languages). So each mathematical branch has its own DSL (we call it ""notation""), and the DSL can barely be combined, but usually a calculation doesn't combine many areas of mathematics. (For example there is a special notation for ""function integrals"" and ""modulo congruence"" and ""fields towers"", but I hope I should never combine the three in the same calculation.) (A similar problem is why regular expressions are so popular, they can be implemented with normal constructions, but sometimes it's easier to use regular expressions. Or the special syntax for here strings.)<p>The problem is that you have to learn all the DSL, but usually the specific details of the DSL have some insight of the main ideas of the area. There is an (perhaps apocryphal) quote from Gauss: ""A good notation is half of the solution."".<p>The problem is not that you must use Assembler to write Java classes. The problem is that you must use 50 almost incompatible Lisp packages, that define its own macros and syntax reader (that hides almost all the parenthesis) and define each one a very useful but limited DSL that compiles to the JVM.",1354712980

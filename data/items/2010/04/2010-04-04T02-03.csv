Now assume your daughter goes to a party and the host gives her either:<p>a Twinkie<p>or<p>some meth<p>As a parent, would you not mind if it was meth? Do you really think the impact on her life, her health, her state of mind, etc. would be about the same whether it's a Twinkie or meth? Or herion? Cocaine? Now how about if it was a Diet Coke? Or a glass of wine? I bet most parents wouldn't worry as much about the Diet Coke (even though it has ""drugs"" in it, like caffeine). And some may not mind if it was the wine -- especialy if just a small amount -- but of course even then, you would be more worried.<p>I think the difference is in how extreme and how fast the bad effects are, comparing a Twinkie to some meth.

1239590,comment,1239408,1239498,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"Sadly, I think it will take just as long for the rest of the industry to really catch up to Apple's new product, at which point Apple will have moved ahead again.  It took more than a year for other smartphone makers to have a serious answer to the iPod, and in my opinion more than two years (with phones like the Droid and Nexus One) to bring a product to market that surpasses the iPhone in some of its own strengths, without sacrificing too much in software or hardware polish.<p>Why do I think the same thing will happen with the iPad?  Because Apple is still among the only companies even trying to do world-class software design and world-class hardware design, and treating the two as a single product.  (Others, with varying levels of success:  Nintendo, Palm, Tivo, Nokia, some divisions of Microsoft.)<p>Tell any other computer maker that they should introduce a new operating system, or a software maker that they need to make their own hardware, and they'll look at you like you're crazy.  Sure, there's a big risk of failure, but it's the only way you'll be able to innovate as radically and successfully as Apple.<p>And this saddens me.  I think Apple products are great - my first computer was a Macintosh SE/30 in 1989, and my first programs were written in HyperCard.  My parents are still happy Mac users two decades later - but I am not.  I value open platforms enough to give up the many benefits of Apple's platform for the very different benefits of open source platforms.  (I'm a former Debian Developer and current Mozilla employee.)<p>Maybe Google will start designing and making its own Chrome OS hardware someday.  (They already worked closely with HTC on the design of Android phones like the Dream and Nexus One.)  Maybe a hardware maker like Intel will really go all-in on a new Linux-based product.  Maybe I can convince Mozilla that we need to design our own hardware platform!  But until that happens, I think many aspects of our consumer products will still be trudging along in Apple's footsteps.",1270348954

I think that PayPal is such an outlier as to be irrelevant to almost all of us.<p>There's the fact that this all happened a decade ago. PayPal launched at a time when the internet was effectively undergoing a Western Expansion and many claims were being staked to build essential infrastructure. Very few ecompanies really understood the internet, there were very few incumbents in the online space and huge opportunities for first movers.<p>I can't imagine any VC today allowing a startup to spend in the way PayPal did. As we all know, back then it just wasn't realistically possible to be properly lean because building stuff was so much more expensive. I'm sure the idea of YCombinator would seem as nonsensical to the founders of the nineties as multimillion first rounds seem to us today.<p>The article alluded to the fact that payment transfer is exceptional in structure. I struggle to think of other startups that required such enormous network effects to become sustainable and had such extraordinary cashflow issues.<p>I think that there's a strong case that a PayPal-like business <i>could</i> be built lean today, but I'm not sure it's relevant - I don't think any of us are trying to build those businesses and I don't think any of us would succeed in doing so.

If I plug my keyboard in to my USB 2.0 computer, then plug my iPad into the keyboard it will only be authorized for 400mA, because the keyboard claimed 100mA.  2 watts.<p>So, best case, charging an iPad from USB 2.0 will take 10 hours, if it is off.

Hence you can't charge while running on a stock USB port.<p>So, what is with the 10 watt charger? Apple, and probably others, got tired of how long it took to charge and have deviated from the USB spec to allow larger charging currents. 1A chargers are common for iPhones, and at least some Macintosh models have higher current USB ports on board.<p>I don't know how they negotiate the higher current, but a 10 watt charger could theoretically charge your iPad in under 3 hours.",1270348327

1239573,comment,1222516,1232677,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Actually yes it's happening right now, there's a very high correlation right now with people who do certain kinds of drugs (cocaine, meth, heroin, that sort of thing) and crazy, violent, self-destructive and community-destructive behavior.  I for one don't want more of that going on than already is going on. I don't want to live in a world where that's more widespread.<p>1. The police in my area don't seem militarized. Where in the US are the police militarized? Are you seriously referring to things like tanks, jets, battleships, mortars, or what? In my town, and it appears in most of the rest of Colorado, we have police and they mostly do old fashioned police sorts of things.<p>2. Attack is a strong word. That also sounds like you're suggesting it's something pervasive. I bet if we did a poll of people, at least here in Colorado, for example, I bet we'd find that at most a very small fraction of 1% of the population will say they feel they have experienced an ""attack on [their] civil liberties"". Another point I'd add to this is one could make a very strong argument for the position that there is no such thing as some inherent ""right"" to anything. People do what they can get away with, and it's been happening like that for millions of years, I suspect. Heck, I'd love to have the ""right"" to do anything I wanted. But in practice, that's not going to happen. And there's that notion of one person's rights end where another's begin. Your right to walk down the street firing a gun ends where my right to walk down the street and not be shot by some idiot, begins.<p>3. the folks who buy a thing are the ones funding it, I would argue. If you buy illegal drugs, YOU are funding the organization which provided it to you. The government did not. That's a physical fact. Yes, if it was legal, then you might be buying it from a different source, and then YOU still would be the one funding it.<p>4. ""gigantic waste of money"" -- I cannot refute this point, merely say it's a question of whether one thinks that the benefits of the situation outweigh the disadvantages. Do the positives outweigh the negatives? Are their better ways of achieving the same goal, for less cost? Perhaps, I don't now. But if your position is that nothing positive has come from it, I think that's a harder case to make.<p>5. again I think this is a case of individuals making poor choices and ruining their OWN lives -- through their OWN actions. The government did not come along and ruin their life, against their will. It's also not clear to me that in every case where an individual buys or sells an illegal drug, and gets busted for it, that when they are processed by the legal system their lives are all automatically ruined -- that's a pretty extreme statement. However, in the other direction, I'd argue that when people CHOOSE to use/consume/inhale/inject those hard, illegal drugs they very often do ruin their own lives, or set them on the road to ruin. They also make the world worse for their families, friends, and communities. There's a lot of evidence to support that position.<p>Hey, if I could live in a world where all the hard, ""bad"" drugs were legal and easily available AND also live in a world that has not turned into a violent, anarchic, ghetto-like hellhole (due to bad drug behavior & culture) I would like that.<p>On your Mexico point... counter-point: there are other countries where the same drugs are also prohibited, and they don't have the serious violent drug gang/war problem as Mexico. And as you pointed out, there are also countries that have looser drug laws, and they have less problems (apparently, in some dimensions) than Mexico or the US. So perhaps the stronger correlation is with the type of culture, and the type of people, and the types of lifestyles, choices, intellect, etc. that exist in those different areas. All I know for sure is that there's a high correlation between hard drug use and with behavior that is destructive to self and community, and so I don't want to live in a world where there's a larger percentage of people doing that. This is not an academic argument, it's a practical one, based on seeing and experiencing and knowing real people in my life and community that have went down the path of hard drugs -- even if those drugs were legal, it wouldn't change their effects on mind and body.<p>Freedom is just one dimension. There are other dimensions I think most folks care about as well. Health, safety, happiness, wealth, efficiency, quality, fairness, etc. On one extreme end of the freedom spectrum you basically have pure anarchy -- and I bet it's a state with much more violence and fear and rape, etc. and a lot less health, safety, justice, etc. Almost all modern societies have intentionally dialed down on the freedom dimension in order to raise one or more of those other dimensions we also desire. I like freedom, it's those other dimensions I won't want to lose. This is not a radical position, it's pretty mainstream actually.",1270348322

All exports must be before imports, which must be before definitions; modules can't be interleaved; when pattern matching, all patterns must be on consecutive lines.<p>I've found the usefulness of LP to be directly related to (1) how large a particular library is and (2) how much original thought went into it. Most of my Haskell libraries, so far, are relatively small -- a few hundred lines, at most. Furthermore, many are bindings to C libraries -- GNU SASL, CPython, YAJL -- and there's not much complex code involved. For Haskell, the tipping point seems to be around 1000 LOC for ""native"" code.<p>dbus-core is just over 2500 LOC, and is a reasonably complete implementation of DBus in pure Haskell. Using literate programming (specifically, NoWeb) has been tremendously helpful. It's the only library I use LP for, but that's only because it's the largest I've written in Haskell.<p>Notably, another of my libraries (network-protocol-xmpp) is approaching the 1000 LOC mark, and I've noticed some problems keeping track of the code. I plan to convert it to LP / NoWeb after the next release.<p>If you have any large, complex libraries, I highly recommend at least experimenting with LP. It's relatively easy to convert existing libraries to LP, and because NoWeb is so flexible, you can convert them a little bit at a time as you become more comfortable with the tools.",1270346424

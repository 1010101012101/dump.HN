I figured I would post here as well)<p>Under 35 U.S.C. 301, you may submit proof of prior art to the patent office for any patent. To quote:<p>""Any person at any time may cite to the Office in writing prior art consisting of patents or printed publications which that person believes to have a bearing on the patentability of any claim of a particular patent. If the person explains in writing the pertinency and manner of applying such prior art to at least one claim of the patent, the citation of such prior art and the explanation thereof will become a part of the official file of the patent. At the written request of the person citing the prior art, his or her identity will be excluded from the patent file and kept confidential.""<p>In short, call the patent office, and tell them that you wish to submit prior art under 35 U.S.C. 301. Given that you have a published book with a clear description of the subject matter, it is a very strong case.<p>Alternatively, you could ignore it. It may not issue, and even if it does, it may not be defensible.",1258643817

Bars, nightclubs, restaurants and casino's would be there from the start to help clear out people's pockets. It would be self-sustaining with gardens and hydroponics, wind power and eventually wave power, both of which could be sold back to shore to decrease maintenance costs.<p>If it failed, so what, it would advance the idea of seasteading. If it succeeded I'd attempt to expand the platform, or build another platform within about 3km, so that the platforms could be connected with existing gondela technology.<p>The idea of seasteading has always fascinated me, but to make it carbon-neutral or even better carbon-negative (encouraging coral growth around the bases, out putting power to onshore communities, etc.) would send an environmental message that the people who care about the environment aren't just a bunch of witless nags at greenpeace but are people who actually want to change the <i>whole</i> world into something better. This environmental message could be capitalized on during expansion phases and used to attract businesses.<p>In theory you would become a monopolic supplier of all goods. Food, power, housing, transport, would all be owned by your company meaning you can attain income from all aspects of the business and keep it profitable. By keeping the market open, it makes you look friendly and open (consider you own the transportation, so anyone competing with you and winning is still paying you money).<p>In 40 years time I would be a James Bond-esque supervillain and precisely where I want to be before retirement.",1258643426

Computers used to JUST be these beige boxes that sat under our desks.  Actually at one point, it used to be huge mainframes.  Now, computers are everywhere, and by computers I mean full fledged system specific GUIs tied to some piece of hardware.  They're in our pocket, in our cars, on our desks, in our laps, on our tvs, in the cloud as servers, and probably other places I'm not naming.  This is where I see other Operating Systems taking away Microsoft's dinner.  Microsoft got us to the first billion, but I'm pretty sure someone else will get us to the first trillion.  Now, that's pretty exciting.<p>As far as the desktop goes?  Apple will have its market share, which is the high end computing market (they have ~90% of it that 10%) and windows will have the other 90%.  You can make Ubuntu function/look exactly like windows/mac.  The problem comes down to the OEMs.  Will they support it?  Will they make the strong push in marketing to get people to try it out?  Your grandmother is not going to do sudo and apt-get commands.  If an OEM made beautiful machines, that ran tight software/hardware integration running a customized version of Ubuntu, marketed the hell out of it, and offered the right amount of training like Apple does, it could possibly get off the ground.  Even then, linux is a scary place for the average person and the apps just aren't there.<p>Honestly, I'm more bullish on other Operating Systems taking us from billions to trillions on devices that aren't beige boxes that sit under our desk.",1258642823

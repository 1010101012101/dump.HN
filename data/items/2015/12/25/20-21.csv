My understanding so far:<p>In 2008, he made a promise to buy Mexican Maya oil in 2009, at the 2008 price of Maya. The Mexican government presumably pays him some fees for handling this risk for them. In addition, if the price of Maya goes up in a year, he pockets the difference.<p>However, if the price of Maya goes down, he still has to buy at the higher 2008 price, but can only sell the Maya on to others at the lower 2009 price. To protect against this risk, he bought &#x27;options&#x27; - the right, but not the obligation - to buy WTI and Fuel (amongst others) at some strike price. This is where I get lost. How was he reducing his exposure by selling Fuel, had he bought options at some super-low strike price, thus letting him earn a profit when he exercised those options and sold the Fuel?<p>Then, what restructuring did he do with the Mexican government in  a way that could benefit both Mexico and him?<p>He had also short-sold WTI - he had bet on WTI prices going down, by promising to sell it in 2009, at a 2008ish rate, allowing him to buy it cheaply off the market and fulfill his promises. This, I understand.<p>Then, he &quot;accumulated a massive position in Maya&quot;, which &quot;strengthened significantly&quot; compared to his hedges. Does this mean that the price of Maya was recovering faster than the other oils that he had bet against, so he was able to sell his Maya at a profit?",1451076098

But economically speaking, if exchanges started allowing you to trade both coins against each other, then supply has doubled while total Bitcoin demand remained constant. So the price would tank to at least 50% of its previous level on each side of the fork to reflect the new equilibrium.<p>Anyway, I think this is extremely unlikely to happen, because:<p>1) It requires 50% of miners to cooperate to even create a >1MB chain<p>2) Anyone using the old chain would be insecure, due to lack of mining power making it susceptible to a 51% attack.<p>3) If that many miners were on board, it&#x27;s unlikely that existing core developers would opt to continue working on an insure fork rather than admit defeat.<p>4) If that many miners were on board, it&#x27;s unlikely that exchanges would opt to confuse users by letting them separately trade two different types of Bitcoin, rather than just switching to the more secure, more popular chain.",1451075792

10792264,comment,10788550,10788550,0,0,josephpoon,,,"> It seems I wasn’t the only one with this concern as there’s been a fairly recent pivot away from the hub-and-spoke network topology to a more organic, wallet-to-wallet routing. The network is now envisioned as a more pure p2p payment layer without those large scale payment hubs.<p>As the co-author of the Lightning Network, this is not true, there has been no pivot. The design has always designed around wallet-wallet topologies from the beginning (try doing a Find for the word &quot;hub&quot; in the paper). Will there be nodes more connected than others? Of course. But with LN, they are designed to be interchangeable and formless. It may look like other P2P topologies of ever-shifting &quot;supernodes&quot;, but never irreplaceable &quot;hubs&quot; like Visa or Fedex&#x27;s single primary Memphis, TN hub -- in fact you&#x27;d be challenged to find a P2P network with a topology of only a handful of static hubs (this makes sense because establishing connectivity is cheap in a virtual system, opposed to physical infrastructure like wires or an airport).<p>I&#x27;m not particularly happy that &quot;small-block skeptics&quot; are using LN as some kind of punching bag against their pet ideas of who the enemies are (the arguments have become highly politicized in the bitcoin community). The LN paper itself presumes bigger blocks, and have never argued that LN is the sole solution, merely that a large component of scalability needs to occur via moving transactions off-chain. The alternatives are a failure of mining incentives (whether it be low-value transactions get crowded off bitcoin and moves to a bitcoin-backed centralized ledger, or the fee-market breaks down and miners reduce fees far too low due to commons externalities).<p>There is a clear obvious misunderstanding of core principles in computer science, wishful thinking does not solve real problems. It is is akin to assuming that systems are easily capable of a broadcast topology -- that everyone in the world can be on the same wifi access point. Bigger block capacity is desirable, but it&#x27;s also desirable to be able to instantly transact a payment of $0.0001 without everyone in the world processing that payment.<p>(I&#x27;m going to be intermittent with computer access today due to the holidays but I will reply to email or respond tomorrow :P)",1451075462

This is succintly describable as:<p>1. Notice how all the functions in an RD parser are almost the same: call the next-higher-level, then loop with that call while the current token is at this level. The topmost level is for consuming a terminal or a parenthesised subexpression. That can easily be turned into one parameterised function and a table lookup for the tokens.<p>2. The first set of recursive calls always goes &quot;to the top&quot;, so why not call that directly. This is the &#x27;P&#x27; function in the article. The second set of recursive calls are nothing more than finding the right level to process the current token, so jump directly to that level by calling the function directly with that level number instead of repeatedly descending via recursive calls until the current level matches the token. With the current token being of level n, the parameterised RD parser calls expr(1) -> expr(2) -> expr(3) -> ... expr(n) when it could just call expr(n).<p>I think this is such an elegantly simple algorithm that anyone learning computer science should have implemented at least once along with the usual study of recursive data structures.

Are you giving me the chips for free?  No?  Um, okay, are you second-sourcing the chip so if/when you implode I&#x27;m not hanging in the wind?  No, can&#x27;t do that either. Hmmm.<p>So the common denominiator becomes Bluetooth or WiFi.  And, at that point, why do I really need you except for the backend?  And why can&#x27;t I just spin that myself if I really needed to?",1451073860

Clojurescript isn&#x27;t really a pure language, it just makes some types of purity the default. If you need to get dirty and mutable then that&#x27;s simple, still simpler than plain js in my opinion.<p>Clojurescript and Clojure have very good interop with their host language, integrating 3rd party libs is very simple. To be fair, you will have to write the glue code more often than when working in js since there is a smaller user base.",1451073790

Since the current price represents the total demand, the market cap must equal the sum of the parts, so coins on each side would become less valuable. I would expect the aggregate would actually go down, due to lack of faith in Bitcoin developers being able to get shit done (and possibility for other coins to pick up the slack).",1451073651

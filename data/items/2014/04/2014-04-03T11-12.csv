Unfortunately, the SRV specification prohibits anyone from using SRV records for protocols where the protocol’s definition does not specify the use of SRV records.<p>I.e. since HTTP does not specify the use of SRV records, web browsers are not allowed to use SRV lookups to locate HTTP servers.<p>The ones to blame are, instead, HTTP standards writers, which have not written a new HTTP standard taking advantage of the wonderful thing which SRV records are.",1396526380

However in a situation, such as the Target breach, that released peoples credit card and personal data to thieves, if you used bitcoin you would not even have to go to any effort to see if you were affected. If you used Traget and paid by CC then you need to check if your email was one of the compromised ones, check statements for unusual purchases, deal with reclaiming that if necessary and also fixing your credit report (potentially). If you paid by bitcoin all they have is the address you paid from and your delivery address (which they have if they get your personal info anyway).",1396526355

Aside this main objective, I was willing to learn Ruby and to try to abstract my production to make something reusable. Since I already had implemented genetic algorithm in a few different languages and looked at various libraries, I already had good basis for how to design the whole thing.<p>The presented code is not as simple as I would have like to be at the first place, but the composition pattern and the strategy pattern used in the project make the whole thing quite reusable to my opinion.<p>To my opinion, this code is unit tested and much more complete than what is present in the other gems. The main drawback being that right now the code is only compatible with Ruby 1.8.7.<p>Any comments and opinions are welcome. I&#x27;m curious to have external feedback on this.",1396526316

As a German, the only viable option if I am spending most my time within Germany was to go with a German carrier. Now with the removal of roaming charges, the EU becomes the domestic market and in principle I could shop around other EU countries to find the best deal. Austria for example has some really good deals, so maybe I will go with a carrier from there. And with SEPA even billing should not be an issue.<p>The other (intended) thing this will spur is further consolidation of the EU Telecoms market as there will suddenly be a much larger number of competing players on the market. As I said, in principle Austrian Telecoms are now for the first time directly competing for customers with Spanish Telecoms in Germany, so I guess we&#x27;ll see a lot more mergers in the close future.

But they just don&#x27;t compensate for the UI issues, and those are problematic.<p>e.g. on the interaction front, I&#x27;m not talking about technical interaction, but UI interaction - there&#x27;s no reason metro apps <i>can&#x27;t</i> run in a window nor classic apps can&#x27;t run in fullscreen, even if their design won&#x27;t be optimal for the non-normal UI.  As is, you&#x27;re forced to use two quite different UI&#x27;s intermixed with one another. (Task-switching between classic+modern is problematic too).<p>I spend most of my time in and switching among the application I use to work/play in.  I think the worst missing feature is the missing recent files/applications feature which means that ad-hoc workloads with various single-purpose tools are quite unhandy.  It&#x27;s not just recent files: the same thing counts for recent programs.  Win7 provides taskbar (and start) pinning for your really common programs.  Win8 provides start customization.  But for the rest - the stuff you organically happen to use a lot for a particular task - Win8 has no alternative to the win7 recent programs.<p>Boot time: that&#x27;s nice, but I really don&#x27;t care very much - my old boot time was less than 30s, and now it&#x27;s probably even less - but how often do you reboot?<p>I haven&#x27;t noticed the multi-monitor support being better, what&#x27;s the advantage?<p>In any case: there&#x27;s no doubt that win8 has numerous technical advancements - and frankly, I <i>like</i> the modern interface.  That makes it all the more aggravating that the UI is such a haphazard mess.  The problem isn&#x27;t modern - it&#x27;s how they&#x27;ve done virtually no work in coordinating between the two UIs.  If good integration is impossible, I&#x27;d even rather just have a mode-switch: render everything in classic mode, or everything in modern, regardless of what the app was really designed for.",1396525590

In the 1930s, the AMA attempted to prohibit its members from working for the then-primitive health maintenance organizations that had sprung up during the Great Depression, which violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and resulted in a conviction ultimately affirmed by the US Supreme Court.[7] The AMA&#x27;s vehement campaign against Medicare in the 1950s and 1960s included the Operation Coffee Cup supported by Ronald Reagan. Since the enactment of Medicare, the AMA reversed its position and now opposes any &quot;cut to Medicare funding or shift [of] increased costs to beneficiaries at the expense of the quality or accessibility of care&quot;. However, the AMA remains opposed to any single-payer health care plan that might enact a National Health Service in the United States, such as the United States National Health Care Act. In the 1990s, the organization was part of the coalition that defeated the health care reform advanced by Hillary and Bill Clinton.&quot;</i><p>They also to fight to protect their status, and prevent nurses, pharmacists and other less-credentialled healthcare workers from performing roles that they could do just as well (if not better) and at cheaper cost.

Just because there is a doctor shortage, the AMA argues, is no reason to put nurses in charge and endanger patients.”<p>But others argue that Nurse Practitioners have the needed training and that, in fact, doctors who have gone through the full medical school curriculum are over-qualified for a job that, today, is more about coordinating care than medical science.&quot;</i>",1396524798

I wasn&#x27;t talking about the rm function, I was talking about the &quot;last&quot; function in my original comment.<p>> If you did this it would be deduction.<p>I did enumerate every possible way that function can go wrong in Haskell.  It is precisely n-1 where n is the length of the list (we can ignore the empty list case without loss of generality because it is easy to handle that case statically).  In every other language in mainstream use today, the number of ways it could go wrong is infinite.  And we actually do see those happen sometimes in practice.<p>The analysis in the above paragraph is the &quot;active acquisition of information from a primary source&quot;, i.e. observational evidence for the inductive argument that code written in Haskell is &quot;more likely to be correct&quot;.<p>> As you said earlier, they &quot;rewrote a substantial groovy app in Haskell&quot;. There are too many confounding variables there.<p>I&#x27;m keenly aware of the confounding variables.  But the fact is, you&#x27;re never going to find a significant study that doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of confounding variables.  If that&#x27;s your criteria for making a decision in this domain, then you won&#x27;t be accomplishing much.  In fact, I doubt we even have strong experimental evidence that C is more productive than assembly language.  If you have different people write the different languages, the skill of the people is a confounding variable.  If you have the same person write them all, then their knowledge of the languages and their mounting domain experience are confounding variables.<p>So we take whatever evidence we can get.  If my bayesian prior was that all languages are equally likely to result in correct programs, then this evidence tips the scale slightly in Haskell&#x27;s favor.  We can&#x27;t take it to the bank yet, but we&#x27;ve only looked at a couple pieces of evidence.  (That&#x27;s not the only evidence out there, but I&#x27;m constraining the discussion to this because of the bandwidth of this communication channel.)  Point is, I think we&#x27;re at the point where savvy forward-looking people should at least take note of Haskell&#x27;s potential benefits.

If the idea is to use asymmetric crypto as a backing for OTP, I suppose you&#x27;d do something like signing TIME+salt, and transmit the signature and the salt. Unless there is some trick one can do with checking partial asymmetric signatures, I don&#x27;t see how you could get away with sending less than SIG+salt, or ~50 bytes. That&#x27;s way too long for typing in, as a usable fall-back.<p>It might actually involve less typing to generate a shared secret -- but that&#x27;d completely break the UX -- so it doesn&#x27;t sound like a sane fall-back to me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/3216/signatures-rsa-compared-to-ecdsa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/3216/signatures-rs...</a><p>[t] <a href=""http://spod.cx/blog/two-factor-ssh-auth-with-pam_oath-google-authenticator.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spod.cx/blog/two-factor-ssh-auth-with-pam_oath-google...</a>",1424418158

When I replaced my motherboard under AppleCare, they basically gave me a new board with the same design defect. In less than 6 months, I had the same problems, and then my MBP died over the XMas holidays. Lucky me, I replaced it with a Lenovo that came with Superfish installed.<p>For the news to be great, they&#x27;d have to replace my current board with a redesigned board that won&#x27;t fail again in 6 months. Until more information trickles in from people who have gotten their MBPs fixed, I&#x27;m going to reserve judgment.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m very happy that Apple finally decided to make whole the people who have suffered with this problem for the past few years.

China continues to grow despite recent staggarings; Taiwan is projected to continue acceleration of growth; South Korea with support from China and the United States are planning for reunification with North Korea (and the subsequent acquisition of resource rich lands). The region&#x27;s development index is cresting a knee on the curve - pairing nicely with its large population, strong trading routes, and stability (compared with the European pressure cooker).<p>China, the new kid on the block, now the largest creditor nation and second largest economy is leading a trade deal in the Pacific (and a few other invited nations) called AFTA - a trade deal the United States has not been invited to, despite her vocal interest.<p>The US has done what it can to dissuade allies from joining in on AFTA, and has offered these allies instead membership to an alternative trade deal - one that curiously lacks China, despite its vocal interest...<p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership represents a keystone in America&#x27;s &#x27;pivot&#x27; to Asia (/&#x27;rebalancing&#x27;); a bid to win key influence on the rules for international trade policy in the region that will benefit the US - and will exclude China unless it agrees to the some longstanding US wishlists (especially with regard to intellectual property).<p>It is an unfortunate fact then that what is know from leaked drafts of the trade that it comes with certain trojan horses - administrative and corporate wishlists that could not pass the muster of even a generally distracted domestic voting population, such as requirements mentioned in the article for internet service providers to filter and monitor customer traffic.<p>It&#x27;s a sort of damned if you do damned if you don&#x27;t scenario. The TPP is important for navigating future global financial and international policy options, but bundled with it are laws that would otherwise be rejected at the ballot box.<p>To summarize it&#x27;s important to understand the issue broadly: it is dangerous to be a single issue voter. It would be a shame to trade major strategic opportunities for the ability to share ripped DVDs. It would also be a shame to take another step back on internet freedom for international trade whose benefits in the short term are bound to be largely captured by large and multinational corporations.

If anyone uses your branch, then the history will not match up and they will not be able to merge their changes because Git will not be able to determine the order of the commits.  I have gone through this more than once and it is not fun at all.<p>Rebase works extremely well for what is was designed for:  You have a lot of people working completely independently and you want to submit your changes to a central maintainer.  You rebase your branch so that the changes appear to be applied directly onto their branch.  It makes it much, much easier to review.  If the change is accepted then it is merged and everybody uses the merged version.  If not, the branch is destroyed (of course you still have your changes in your repository).  As long as nobody makes any changes to (or branches off of) a branch that will be rebased, then there will be no problem.<p>Because the vast majority of people use git as kind of a &quot;better SVN&quot;, with a centralized repository and published branches (using Github or the like), most people should never, ever use rebase.  Especially if you are trying to design a simple workflow for neophytes, then you should almost certainly not make rebase easy to reach.<p>Like I said, I like rebase, but it is not something that fits well in a collaborative office environment.  It works much better in a hugely distributed open source project, or a personal project (if you are being very careful).",1424416987

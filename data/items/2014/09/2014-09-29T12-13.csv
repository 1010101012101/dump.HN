Now, I have a very dispiriting view of humanity (the fact that we evolved from primates who&#x27;d fight a lot, rape a lot, etc.), it does much to take away &#x27;meaning&#x27; from my life.

If I&#x27;d been more outgoing, more social, I think I would not have this negative and sorrowful outlook in life.<p>I strongly suspect that others pondering the Camus question of suicide are similarly alone or asocial.

I don&#x27;t think it can be done.<p>Many media formats (including all digital TV formats) encode a rolling hardware timestamp of 33 bits (or more) which won&#x27;t be the same for two separate segments by random chance. Audio, video, subtitles and other metadata will be ordered differently in the stream because they all comes from sources that have their own separate clocks. Synchronization between clocks at different stages in the media pipeline will cause different frames in the sequence to be dropped, padded, made into keyframes, etc, which then affects every bit in subsequent frames. TV stations use time-based watermarks. TV stations use digital compositing software that may retain bits from previous frames on an ongoing basis. Many studio media pipelines still involve analog steps.<p>The list of complications goes on.<p>Unless your pipeline is lossless, uses only digital sources and uses totally synchronized clocks for all stages, you&#x27;re about as likely to get an MD5 hash collision by accident as you are to get any two non-trivial sequences of compressed video to be bit-identical.",1411994928

8382646,comment,8382335,8382335,6,0,pdkl95,,,"First, let me say that the aggressive approach to <i>actually making encryption happen</i> that CloudFlare has been pushing recently is <i>very</i> commendable. The hard part about finally retiring the old plaintext protocols we currently are stuck with is critical mass - nobody sees the point when plaintext seems to &quot;work just fine&quot;. The various steps CloudFlare has taken to encourage SSL will go a long way towards reversing that attitude.<p>That said, I worry about the future we are creating by entrusting so much security and traffic to a <i>single point of failure</i>.[1]<p>It seems to me that CloudFlare is positioning themselves as another Google or Facebook, where a key feature of their business is that they get to track the web history of a large portion of internet users. Much like Google gets to have a lot of my email when other party is @gmail.com, CloudFlare gets click histories by people using their CDN and caching/filtering servers.<p>While I don&#x27;t <i>really</i> know anything about the motives and personalities behind the company, I can give them the benefit of the doubt for now. Unfortunately, their motives don&#x27;t matter - in a world where &quot;national security letters&quot; Prism, XKeyscore, and the like exist, CloudFlare&#x27;s motives may not matter.<p>Even more concerning is that while it my hard to avoid Google&#x27;s tracking, it is at least theoretically possible. With CloudFlare (or any similar service) we are stuck with a situation similar to tinyurl/t.co/bit.ly [2] where content is hidden behind serves from which you have to request the real URL (or in this case, the content itself).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - SSL becoming significantly more common is good regardless of what else is going on, and CloudFlare still deserves a <i>lot</i> of praise for advancing a problem that has been so resistant to progress in the past. I would even agree that CloudFlare&#x27;s caching services and security protections are (very) good engineering techniques that we <i>should</i> be using. It just seems like everybody is (yet again) setting up a single point of failure that will suddenly have very significant consequences the minute somebody with real power decides they want those very-revealing server logs.<p>[1]  I&#x27;d be the first to admit I don&#x27;t have the best understanding of how CloudFlare works; corrections to any misunderstandings I may have about their business or tech would be greatly appreciated.<p>[2] <a href=""http://preview.tinyurl.com/feckless-imbroglio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://preview.tinyurl.com/feckless-imbroglio</a>",1411994776

I haven&#x27;t given the code a read, so take this with a grain of salt, but I feel like the exact demo they showed off was mostly a graphics card demo. You can get most, if not all, of that scene rendered purely on the graphics card itself using fancy shaders without needing to hit the CPU very much. I feel like I would have been much more impressed if they had created something such as a level from Megaman (since they showed a sprite of Megaman near the start) that the presenter was able to play. I would consider it more impressive since it would have to spend more time in Racket dealing with physics, collision, AI, etc. instead of spending the majority of the time on the graphics card. Hopefully they&#x27;ll be able to show off a demo like that soon (if one doesn&#x27;t exist already) to really show off the capabilities of the engine inside Racket. Honestly though, the whole project is exciting for me since they&#x27;re really just trying to explore new ways of writing games. I&#x27;m looking forward to what they do in the future.",1411993377

Encryption is supposed to make the contents of the file look random. Compression is itself a form of in-file deduplication. Where ZFS deduplication will be extremely useful: on a SAN in a video editing studio where originals are kept in raw format. Even then, file-level and block-level dedups will probably be the least effective means of deduplication. What we need is byte-level deduplication which computes anchor points from which data ought to be deduplicated. Even then, it sounds like the dedup feature would be scripted so that it be a part of the tooling, and would be updated with the team&#x27;s projects.

It is astonishing how institutes with huge budgets put videos like these (it is quite common with such big names as MIT).<p>Yes if only MIT spent some money and made high quality videos available for free to millions of people...<p><a href=""https://www.edx.org/course-list/mitx/allsubjects/allcourses"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.edx.org/course-list/mitx/allsubjects/allcourses</a>",1411992141

Never had many friends, few family members, mediocre career. Not much money in the bank. In a year, I lost few of my elderly family members. It came as a shock.\nI realized, after 20 years of career, I haven&#x27;t achieved much. There are not many people in the world, who know about me, about my existence.  Whatever I was doing at my job, was not going to make any difference to the world or to anybody.  If I die nothing matters. I lost interest in doing things.  It was dead end for me. Nothing made sense. I started getting suicidal thoughts<p>Whatever I did, my brain told me, &quot; why bother?&quot;  Many people tried to advise me. But this is the first time, it didn&#x27;t matter. In my life, first time I didn&#x27;t care about others opinions.<p>One day I doodled something on paper. I realized. I like to doodle. So I doodled more. I felt happy.  I did my 9 to 5 job, but whenever I got time, I doodled.  After few days, I put them for sell on different platforms. I wasn&#x27;t expecting anybody to buy it. In fact, it was like I was craving for rejection,  just so that I can feel that “I don&#x27;t care&quot; feeling.\nI started wearing whatever I like. I started doing things which I liked. I realized I am the most important person in my life. It lifted lot of weight from my mind. I felt free<p>Almost after one year, somebody bought one of my doodles as a company logo. Not much money, but I felt good. I gave it to charity.  \nSo, mostly things aren’t changed much in my life. But my attitude is changed. My biggest achievement in my life is, change of outlook from negative to positive. I started meeting many unfortunate people through my charity work. People, who don&#x27;t have roof on their head, people with terminal illness. I realized how blessed I am, to have this kind of life. Now I stopped taking things for granted. There is lot of life out there, more than promotion, bad boss, and dirty office politics.",1411992075

Places where you need to work against the language for perf reasons should be rare (and if it concerns most of the code in a project, then I&#x27;d question the choice of language for that project). Also that holds true for most languages. Even in C you&#x27;ll avoid allocations in tight loops that need to be fast because it comes with an unpredictable performance cost. That&#x27;s not much different than pre-allocating a buffer to work on prior to an algorithm in C#.",1411992021

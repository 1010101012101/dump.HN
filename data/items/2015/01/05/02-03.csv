GP&#x27;s view, which I share, is that people always complain about new releases, forgetting that the previous release had its problems as well. As GP said, bad headlines are easier to make than good ones. Simply reiterating that you think the previous release had fewer problems, and that there are anecdotes out there about problems in the current release, is hardly a refutation of this. This is entirely consistent with GP&#x27;s view.<p>I for one have experienced no significant change in reliability on the road from Snow Leopard to Yosemite (for what that&#x27;s worth).",1420426651

8836915,comment,8834475,8836036,0,0,curun1r,,,"I don&#x27;t want a tool that does both provisioning and configuration management as I feel the latter should be a real-time concern rather than a deploy-time concern. Using Consul (<a href=""https://consul.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://consul.io</a>) and Consul Template (<a href=""https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template</a>), we&#x27;re able to keep configuration centralized, secure and have it deployed automatically every time it changes. And it removes the distinction between configuration changes that are triggered by some event (machine failure, network partition, monitoring, auto-scaling, etc), changes that are triggered by a developer commit and changes that operations wants to make (maintenance, DDoS response, etc). Terraform provisions all of that and then configuration management happens on an ongoing basis.<p>I&#x27;m really not trying to sound like a shill for Hashicorp, but we use a bunch of their tools and find them to be, overall, very worthwhile and focused on accomplishing a single logical task which makes them easily composable with tools from other vendors. I also don&#x27;t want it to sound like I&#x27;m criticizing Nix or NixOS...they sound like excellent tools. My only point was that there are other ways to solve the problems expressed in the posting and that each solution has tradeoffs that DevOps needs to consider when designing infrastructure. Your blog struck me as being a strawman criticism of somewhat dated tools without consideration for newer options, especially since your discussion of Docker was so narrowly focused on the actual Docker tool without any consideration given for Fleet, Swarm, ECS or any of the host of orchestration options in the Docker ecosystem.<p>If you&#x27;d written it more from a position of &quot;here&#x27;s how NixOS has made my life easier,&quot; you&#x27;d probably find that people would be more receptive to it. But, instead, it had a &quot;here&#x27;s why NixOS is better than the alternatives&quot; feel to it which is going to rub people the wrong way when it&#x27;s pretty clear that you&#x27;re not aware of all the alternatives. NixOS is one good option, but it&#x27;s by no means the only good option.<p>> Perhaps you could even use it [Terraform] to provision NixOs machines?<p>You definitely can, so long as your servers are virtualized. Terraform is significantly less useful in a bare-metal world. However Terraform is really about provisioning specific machines. For example, you might write Terraform to provision 1 SMTP server, 3 web front-ends behind a load balancer and 2 database hosts. But it&#x27;s pretty crude at doing provision-time tasks...it basically allows you to run shell commands. Where you&#x27;d do the bulk of your provisioning would be in a tool like Packer, Aminator or other such tool that creates VM images that can be deployed. That&#x27;s where you&#x27;d start with a base NixOs image and then declare what&#x27;s installed on an SMTP server, a web front-end and a database server. Terraform would just reference those images and size the machines.",1420426494

I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed to learn that it requires 9, as I had thought of them as one of the last bastions of scale up rather than scale out, but 9 is approaching a large number.<p>I think the complexity costs of scaling out are underestimated; or rather, they&#x27;re just accepted as a fact of the matter, like there isn&#x27;t an alternative. More moving parts in the name of redundancy etc. usually makes things more fragile, without very careful design and implementation.<p>Interesting that you bring up GitHub. GitHub was probably the most unreliable service our startup used before we moved to Stash. You could count on it being down for a few hours every month, reason given usually &quot;DDoS&quot;.

Instead, I&#x27;m creating new loopback interfaces, lo:0, lo:1, etc. Presumably any tooling that monitors an interface could be set to watch those (in fact, you can create the interfaces on a machine, and leave them up in between runs, telling Damocles about them using &#x27;register_interface&#x27;. That way they stay consistent and can be referenced by other tooling).<p>You can actually use this to test multiple systems working together as well. This is completely agnostic to what&#x27;s running on the interfaces. As long as everything can be run on one machine (at least until I find the time to do the work to get it working remotely), you can set up multiple interfaces each of which runs an instance of one app and then another set of interfaces that each run an instance of another app (etc), configure the apps to talk to each other however you like, and then start monkeying with the connections between interfaces using this.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with generative testing but in general, my goal wasn&#x27;t to provide a testing framework for distributed systems, but instead a library with higher level primitives that could be used to easily compose pretty complex failure scenarios.",1420426343

While there&#x27;s an argument to be made that this is now turning around (and no doubt it should, and should have many years ago), I still think the trend is moving in favour of credentialism rather than away from it.<p>I don&#x27;t really know what can be done about it because as Nassim Taleb put it, university degrees are like racketeering - bad for the collective but good for the individual,[0] so unfortunately I think it will continue to get worse for the foreseeable future at least. If you had disregarded everything this article said in 1985 and gone straight to HBS followed by Goldman, you would probably be sitting in your mansion right now and not care in the slightest about the credentialism problem, entrepreneurship or Silicon Valley. Obviously there&#x27;s a ton of value judgments you can make about that, but the fact it is true is a huge net negative for society, as we need to align prestige and financial incentives around behaviours which are good for the collective.<p>Ultimately I think any solution to this problem would have to go back to the root of it, which is the increasing strength of vested interests in Western society who push for the creation of rents to perpetuate their wealth and power. Ultimately that reality is what makes rent-seeking professions so attractive, and in turn allows those professions to monopolise and &#x27;rent seek from rent-seeking&#x27;, i.e. have a monopoly over rent-extraction in the same way the law and investment banking does.<p>How you would solve that? ... well I don&#x27;t know.

8836758,comment,8836271,8836447,0,0,dangrossman,,,"This seems like a bad idea. Firstly, the melt value of a nickel is less than $0.05 [1]. Maybe he was confused by the fact that it costs more than $0.05 to mint each coin; that&#x27;s because there are costs other than the materials. That also means it&#x27;d be cheaper to just buy the metals that are in the nickels than to buy the nickels if you wanted to bet on their price. If the government switches to a different composition, there will be <i>less</i> demand for nickel and copper, which doesn&#x27;t bode well for the melt value <i>increasing</i> significantly beyond $0.05 because of a switch.<p>Secondly, just holding the nickels doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re sure to not lose any money. As you said, simply stuffing cash (or nickels) under your mattress means you&#x27;re losing some every day to inflation. You&#x27;re also losing all the potential gains of the other things you could be doing with that money other than piling up nickels. At the very least, you take no risk of losing the principal by sticking it in a savings account (~1% APY) or buying a 1-5 year CD (2-3%).<p>Then again, I don&#x27;t have a couple million dollars to blow on stockpiling nickels. The sage investor must know something I don&#x27;t.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.coinflation.com/coins/1946-2007-Jefferson-Nickel-Value.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coinflation.com/coins/1946-2007-Jefferson-Nickel-...</a>",1420423433

This wasn&#x27;t the case in my 20s but now that I&#x27;m in my 30s this is just how it went down. Ultimately sitting behind a desk paying a mortgage for 30 years outweighed the social aspect of being lonely right now in my life. But visiting Portland is like going on vacation in my home town and I plan on buying a rental with a garage apartment just for me to have a home base when I&#x27;m in town. With all the financial freedom I have I see this in a few years. But yes, my partner wasn&#x27;t 100% down with the move, regrettably didn&#x27;t move with me.

316376,comment,316002,316002,0,0,jrockway,,,"Wow, this is perhaps the worst article I've ever read in my life.  Very low on facts, very high on random statements passed off on facts.  Not good.<p>I don't think the author has ever been involved with a real open source project before.  It seems like he just has some ideal of what ""open source"" is and thinks that's reality.  His ideal seems to be lots of constructive discussion and the open exchange of ideas.  That's nice, but we already have the ideas.  What most projects need to do is actually write the code.  All easily-accessible discussion forums do is create lots of bikeshedding that wastes the time of people actually trying to do work.  )Interestingly, the bikeshedders tend to find mailing lists ""too hard to use"" while the people actually writing code wouldn't use anything else.  Do you really wonder why developer discussion forums aren't web-based?)<p>The thing about flat conversation is also junk.  I've used forums with flat comment systems before.  Basically, there is no organization and no discussion happens, everyone just posts their feel-good thoughts about the original article.  Do not want.  (See Metafilter for an example of this.)<p>I agree that wikis are a nice place for creating documentation, but wtf is this: ""Everybody has a browser, but women may have less control over what equipment and software they use, especially as beginners.""  WTF?  Every woman I know has her computer set up exactly the way she needs it to get work done.  That includes lots of specific tools.<p>The advice about using a high-level language is good.  Low level languages suck and are horrible historical artifacts that need to die.  But all of the reasons the author gives are terrible -- ""A language that emphasizes readability, like Python, can make recovering from an interruption easier, and less time is wasted as a result.""<p>Do you have any data, or did you just pull that out of your ass?  The syntax of a language is not what makes code hard to read -- the interactions between various parts of the program is.  You can make the interactions easy to understand in any langauge, or you can make them completely unreadable.  Python is no magic bullet.<p>The rest of the article is just tedious and continues to be a bunch of opinions the author passes off as fact.<p><i>How hard is it to say those two little words, “Thank you”? Men often won’t care (but some will). Women often will care, and the cold shoulder of not responding to a contribution with some kind of acknowledgment is truly unacceptable</i><p>I'm a guy, and I care.  I get upset when people say, ""your software sucks!"" and I like it when people say ""jrockway++"".  This is human nature, not some property only shared by women.  (After a while it becomes pretty easy to ignore criticism, however.  Having a thick skin is always good.)<p>Anyway, terrible article.  Next time do some research instead of making shit up.",1222454652

After listening for a little while, I realized it was the same WaMu news from last night, so not a big deal. But things are going downhill and it's due a a fundamentally flawed economy woefully dependent on credit.<p>I expect tough times ahead, but I'm not too concerned. I have real, technical skills that should keep me working through whatever may come. One thing that I'm doing is brushing up on my DBA abilities, because I figure that no matter how bad things get, maintaining databases will not be an option: They're part of the infrastructure now.<p>Call me RMS, but now is the time to make sure that your skills with open source software are top-notch. If things go down the toilet, you can bet that businesses will be hesitant to use expensive Microsoft products when free alternatives are around.

That lets you stretch the adjustment process out to a time period that makes sense for you, and gives you perspective that you wouldn't otherwise have, eg. working for a startup before going to college.",1222454084

316360,comment,314903,315596,0,0,geebee,,,"I've experienced it only second-hand, but I sure have been close to the problem.  I don't blame you for sticking it out, you'd be crazy not to.<p>I recently left a company that moved the office about 50 miles south through heavy traffic.  It also decided, amazingly enough, that telecommuting was ""bad"", so they banned it (not even one day a week).  Yep, everyone who lived 50 miles away is not obligated to drive in to work every day.  They severely diluted everyone's stock, and implemented a bonus plan that was so weak it was embarrassing.<p>Almost all of the UC citizens have left.  But the H1B's are still there.  I don't blame them, they'd be crazy to leave and jeopardize their visas and green card applications.  But it really makes me sick that my government essentially allowed private corporations to essentially control a worker's right to reside in the United States, along with hopes for becoming a citizen.<p>The funny thing is, I'm pretty libertarian.  In my opinion, businesses should be free do do all that crap that my last company did if that's what they want to do.  Nobody owes me a job on my terms, just as nobody owes my former company a talented employee on their terms.<p>That's how free markets work, but the H1B has proved to me that businesses are <i>not</i> in favor of free markets, they're in favor of regulation that benefits them.  When workers gain too much power - not through unions, not through government regulation, but through value - the corporate world will absolutely seek legal systems that give them control over things like visas and green card applications.<p>Makes me worried.  I grew up in SF, so of course I've had plenty of socialists in my life saying things like ""if democracy could change anything, it would be illegal...""  but really, you have to say the same thing about free markets.  It's pretty clear that when they threaten the establishment, the big corps will do everything they can to ensure that free markets are illegalized.",1222453702

Google, Facebook et al are hiring the best and brightest the US engineering schools have to offer, and put them to work on maximizing ad revenue, or - as Lyons puts it - finding better restaurants through social networks.<p>In the meantime, serious problems are going unaddressed and unsolved by the very same ginormous geek brains because we're too busy building sexy webapps to attract VC funding.<p>That's the crux of his argument. It's like watching Dodge or GM finding better places to put cup holders in their new huge SUVs or trucks while gas prices are doubling or even tripling.

The limited curriculum and social life dictated by high school alphas is a waste of your time. Apply to college early - a large one with a great CS department, get your GED and get out!<p>Once you're at college, you'll find a better and more diverse community of smart people, where you'll be able to have a more valuable social life, find more stimulation and still be relatively insulated from real world repercussions when you make mistakes. A university or college will have much broader resources to offer you, and there will be others like you.<p>When I was 27, I went undercover back to high school to research a screenplay. It was a shock. It's not the best environment for anyone to grow and develop, except for a very few super-average people who look good. For everyone else, it varies from <i>eh</i> to outright hostile - a holding tank to live out your adolescence until your hormones normalize enough for you to join the workforce or go to college.<p>If you can actually seek out a better environment, you'll flourish that much sooner and have that much more to contribute, and be that much happier, confident, and yes, laid. No one I know who has gone to college early has regretted it. You don't have to be a genius, just want something other than what high school offers and convince the admissions people at the school where you're applying that you'll flourish there and have the maturity to do well.<p>Not to mention that you'll make an average of $100,000 per year more during your lifetime for each year earlier you leave high school for college.

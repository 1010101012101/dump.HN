A function `Dyn` to `Dyn` probably doesn&#x27;t evaluate its argument&#x27;s type anyway so it could fail at runtime regardless.

It got out of that slump  thanks to the euro, which created a boom in southern Europe, and thus generated export markets for Germany. The nation which benefited the most from the euro is Germany, and yet Germany seems willing to sabotage its own success. If Greece leaves the euro, it becomes more likely that Spain or Italy or Portugal or Ireland might leave the euro. Once these countries leave the euro, they will have weak currencies that will make it easy for them to underprice Germany. One can get a small sense of how this plays out by looking at the growth that Poland has enjoyed, thanks to the weakness of the zloty. Of course, Poland has not seen high growth, since all of its trade partners are stuck in, or near, recession, yet Poland has gained market share in dozens of small industries, such as coffins and beer. And the advantages that Poland has would also become advantages of Greece and Italy and Spain, etc, if they leave the euro. A rational German minister would avoid this at any cost, but the Germans themselves seem entirely blind to the disaster they are getting themselves into. If the euro dies, all of Europe will be hurt, but Germany most of all.<p>Edited to add: interesting about the rapid upvotes and downvotes on this comment.

Find a vulnerability in consumer wifi gear, such that  insecure default allow the default config to accept new code from only inside the LAN. (These types of vulnerabilities with default passowords are common; however, remote access is often disabled.)<p>2. Upload code to one router.<p>3. Infected routers look for neighbors who they can connect to the network of, then upload the attack code once they&#x27;re masquerading as a device on the LAN.<p>4. Repeat 3.<p>Normally, the reason that this attack doesn&#x27;t really work is that there are simply too few open or insecure LANs of the same hardware type for the attack to have an effective spread rate, thus it&#x27;s only a thin weak network and breaks quickly in the face of customers fixing, upgrading, or simply turning off their gear.<p>However, in allowing friends-of-friends to get access to a LAN, Microsoft has removed this barrier to worms spreading across consumer networking gear for anyone that can amass a stock set of profiles with decent geographical coverage, making it a viable way to accelerate the spread of a worm through networking gear.<p>Ed: Of course, once the routers themselves are infected, and you have good geographical coverage, the infected routers can be used as a platform to launch attacks. Again, the reason that we don&#x27;t see this in practice is that it&#x27;s too hard to get access to all of those LANs because of even the weak security that exists.

I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s autodetecting and giving me Australian dollars in it&#x27;s pricing, but in the first paid band it&#x27;s showing me $6.67/user/mo for annual (who knows how many users a small team will have in a year?) or $8/user/mo for month-to-month (the usual pricing). $8/user/month for chat. And it&#x27;s double that to get business-level SLAs. With 25 users in the account, including external teams and contractors, that would mean we&#x27;re paying $200/month ($400 for business SLAs). Per month. For <i>chat</i>. Crazy.<p>And slackbot keeps on claiming any &quot;thank you&quot; that someone says, even if specified @someone, the greedy little bugger.",1434939181
9755806,comment,9754538,9755459,0,0,rdl,,,"It&#x27;s more than 18-30 year olds don&#x27;t have fixed preferences yet.  Most 18-30 year olds are discovering &quot;their favorite&quot; beer, brand of car, toothpaste, etc.  Most 60 year olds, even though they have more disposable income, have more established brand preference.  Hence, it makes more sense to market to the younger people, even if the older people actually spend more.  The genius thing is to have a ladder of products and bring people in at the bottom -- say, a cheap Yaris or Echo to start, and then they move &quot;naturally&quot; upmarket as those cars themselves move upmarket (remember when the Corolla was a low end car?  Now there are several models below it, if you include Scion, for new buyers).  People also tend to move upmarket within the same brand, say up to a Camry, Avalon, Highlander, or even a Lexus.<p>(Obviously this varies by product/market, but generally for most consumer purchases it is valid.)",1434939139

In fact, I believe I was taught this version of the proof in an early undergraduate math class. This version is not constructive, actually the first example of the wikipedia article on constructive proofs points this out:<p>Euclid&#x27;s proof is constructive. But a common way of simplifying Euclid&#x27;s proof postulates that, contrary to the assertion in the theorem, there are only a finite number of them, in which case there is a largest one, denoted n. Then consider the number n! + 1 (1 + the product of the first n numbers). Either this number is prime, or all of its prime factors are greater than n. Without establishing a specific prime number, this proves that one exists that is greater than n, contrary to the original postulate.",1434938662

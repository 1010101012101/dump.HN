Linux elitism and condescending IRC help and etc. are all the norm for tech people but stuff like this will help turn away new participants as fast as anything else.

But invariably, the angriest or most opinionated people in a community will start posting the most and will end up making  their entire scene look a little uglier.

So if 1% use encryption, only 0.01% of emails will be encrypted. If we want most mail to be encrypted we need 70% of people to use encryption. This means it has to be REALLY EASY TO SET UP AND USE.<p>Ideally, when someone buys a PC/phone/tablet, and uses it to communicate with others, it should do strong encryption out of the box, so that the user would have to take explicit steps to not encrypt.<p>Most of these devices run software controlled by Microsoft, Apple or Google, all of which are deeply implicated with the NSA. So it&#x27;s futile to expect that they will willingly protect their users&#x27; privacy. Therefore the next best thing is to write software that once installed will be really easy to use, that is to say in normal operation it will take no effort at all to use (zero user interface).",1373900132

Allow me to follow up on a few of your points:<p>a) If you have any advice on how to get our name out in the geek community then let me know. You are right that a lot of our community stuff is Perl or Geo focussed, but that&#x27;s where our expertise is so that&#x27;s where we can contribute the most. How well received would we be at a Python or Ruby event? Or are there more generic events we should be aware of?<p>b) When it comes to interns and more junior roles we really need to physically see you, every day, with face to face interaction. You just get more bandwidth and more effective communication that way.<p>Your point about working smart is 100% right. Internally we have &#x27;work smart not hard&#x27; as one of our mantras, and that&#x27;s not well reflected in the job ad at all. Thanks!<p>c) We don&#x27;t say anything about money precisely because London is expensive and getting more so every year. One way to work smart is to write an intern job ad that we&#x27;ve hardly touched since 2006, despite the fact that intern salaries have increased consistently every year since then. We also like to be flexible based on people&#x27;s experience - is it really worth putting on a job ad &quot;25K - 50K&quot; when that&#x27;s the range we&#x27;re willing to consider for different candidates?<p>d) We&#x27;re a small company of ~15 people with 4 engineers. That means if we hire you as our fifth engineer you&#x27;re immediately making up 20% of the engineering team! You&#x27;re damn right we want to make our interview process intense. I think it&#x27;s fair to forewarn candidates about that.<p>Thanks again for your feedback.

The number of profitable corporations per capita is going to be lower than a country that attracts corporations in simply on the basis of their low tax rate.<p>You&#x27;ll notice where countries like Ireland are involved, that do have a population to support, they seem to eventually regret the tax haven arrangements they agreed to in the good times.<p>>> If companies could spend the millions they spend on setting up these schemes on a low flat tax rate instead it would be worth it for them even if they ended up paying a bit more than by putting the money in a tax haven because of the time being saved and the good publicity + the positive effect that reasonable low taxes have on the economy.<p>You can&#x27;t really believe this?",1373899945

We talk to them, we show photographs, we demonstrate that we&#x27;re not imperialist aggressors seeking to occupy the country. When you grow up with that lie as accepted truth, it&#x27;s extraordinarily valuable to actually meet foreigners, or even just see them wandering about smiling and waving.<p>It is certainly true that some of my hard currency went to the government. Given that there are a few thousand tourists a year, this means that what they got from me is a tiny, tiny fraction of what they get through their (limited) trade and their black market dealings (they export opium, for example). Given that all of life is a series of compromises, I judge that the income the government got from my visit is far outweighed by the income a number of ordinary citizens got from me, and also the exposure of those ordinary citizens to foreigners. We wandered around in crowds on our own talking to people, met some people in a pub, encountered people on their way to and from work as we wandered around Pyongyang, all that sort of thing. Yes, our trip was carefully organised and monitored, but it&#x27;s simply not the case that everyone we encountered was some kind of government actor.<p>&quot;<i>Particularly when you can see enough across the Chinese portion of the border (particularly in the east, near the town of Chiangbaishan) to understand the situation.</i>&quot;<p>How is that relevant? I didn&#x27;t need to see the situation from China. I went to Pyongyang and Kaesong and Nampho and a whole lot of other places.<p>Presumably you think that the correct way to go is for no foreigners to ever visit, and for the DPRK population to live in ignorance of the outside world, never encountering foreigners and never having the chance to realise that actually their government is lying to them? What&#x27;s your moral defence for that? I went to the DPRK and I put hard currency in the hands of ordinary citizens and I talked to them and I showed them bits of the outside world and shared a pint with some and, on the whole, did more good than harm. The hard currency I put into the hands of the government is regrettable, but outweighed.<p>What have YOU done?<p>&quot;<i>Have you no shame?</i>&quot;<p>The moral high ground and five dollars might just get you a cup of coffee.

The more of a threat they consider you to be, the more you&#x27;re likely to find yourself in jail or worse.<p>Of course, this has been par for the course for political activists ever since Spartacus led a slave rebellion, and it will not stop the minority truly dedicated and idealistic activists.  But the tools of state surveillance and repression have advaced so much that it&#x27;s much harder for ordinary people to participate in the political process beyond voting for two mostly the same parties, writing emails, or making phone calls without suffering serious consequences.<p>This is scaring a lot of people off from even trying to make a difference.  In many ways, many of us already are living in a dystopia.<p>That said, trying to raise the political consciousness, technological literacy, and privacy awarenss of the average individual is still a very worthwhile and usually safe thing to do (depending on how radical and confrontational your tactics are), and we&#x27;d all be much better off if more people did this instead of throwing up their hands and giving up or pretending it&#x27;s not happening.",1373899460

I&#x27;m not one of the people you&#x27;re really looking for here, but I could take a stab at reasons why I haven&#x27;t been beating a path to your door...<p>a) I haven&#x27;t really heard of you. A few words here and there over the years, but how much do you get out there and tell the geek community you exist? I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s specific to a few specific tech areas - which I haven&#x27;t seen.
b) You&#x27;re in London, you talk about &quot;working hard&quot; and being in your &quot;Clerkenwell office&quot;. I&#x27;ve worked round there before, but really? I want a company who&#x27;s more about working smart - and not in one place all the time. How much do you <i>really</i> need to physically see me? Commuting, plus a little bit of a tiny hint of &quot;macho hard work culture&quot; (probably unfair, but...) is enough for me to take a place off my list. It&#x27;s a sellers market, generally.
c) Also... money. London is expensive. Everyone knows London is expensive (and they&#x27;re right). You don&#x27;t say anything about money - no hints, etc. My reaction (being picky) is that it probably isn&#x27;t enough to make it worth my while (and also that you may try and make me the lowest offer you think you can - I&#x27;m assuming you don&#x27;t have open pay scales).
d) Effort. You talk about your tough hiring - multiple rounds, tests, a day working with you (you don&#x27;t say whether you&#x27;ll pay me for this...) Why would I do this? If I&#x27;m smart, capable, good at what I do, I probably know people who want to work with me already - why jump through these hoops for a possibly good job then?<p>These may be unfair points - I hope not, but perhaps - but finding good people right now is about attracting them, not throwing up barriers or making them work for it.",1373898701

Not going to reveal with whom, but it&#x27;s in the vicinity of Mountain View.<p>It would involve relocation to Silicon Valley, so evaluating the possibility of living there is a major part of evaluating the offer.<p>First, some background: I love tech and love to build things, but I also love other things too. I have a family and a five month old baby, and my wife wants to stay home while our kids are young and I support this as well. I am quite interested in developing my career, but I have no interest in becoming an unbalanced workaholic. I also want to have a life, pursue other things, and spend time with the people I love.<p>It&#x27;s not the job I&#x27;m concerned about here.

The US is one of two countries on this planet that expect people who&#x27;s only tie is being a citizen (perhaps never having set foot there and not speaking the language) to file income tax and potentially pay a portion of their income.<p>Even worse, the US expects you to file with them the way you file in your country of residence.  File join in the country you live in?  You&#x27;re expected to file joint with the US then.  Which means your foreign spouse who has no ties to the US of any kind (outside of being married to a citizen) will potentially have to pay <i>US tax</i> on their income.<p>And worst of all, the tax is mostly an annoyance.  The true problem is that you have to report every account you have signing power over.  That includes pension fund.  That includes your companies bank accounts that you manage (which is why an American will never hold such a position in e.g. Switzerland).  Lots of banks also won&#x27;t take Americans on as customers.

See what they think.<p>> <i>IE, if your market grows 10%, you might as well invest in a contracted software team to automate your systems to enable your current labor staff to be 10% more productive than to hire 10% more people.</i><p>And spend more money on the contractors than you would on an equivalent number of employees, have a questionable long term support plan and/or ownership of the software, spend money on staff training, and, best of all, wait a minimum of six months to a year straining under the weight of increased demand (and pissing off all of your existing and new customers in the meantime) while the software gets built and then debugged and documented.<p>Put your theories to the test: run a business.",1373897104

Or just some build flag that you don&#x27;t even see in sources. Often you don&#x27;t know the build flags of every binary as soon as you use binaries. You also don&#x27;t know if the compiler is tweaked to do some preprocessing you don&#x27;t know about (see <i>Reflections on Trusting Trust</i> by Ken Thompson):<p><a href=""http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html</a><p>For security conscious the prefect state is the OS which changes very, very slowly, fixing only security bugs and having binaries used by as many people as possible and which change so seldom that more people can even check them by disassembling them.

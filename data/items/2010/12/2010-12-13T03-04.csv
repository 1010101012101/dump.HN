Over the timescales that startups typically operate under (weeks to months), one senior engineer is more productive than one senior engineer and five junior engineers.  The former can get a lot of code done and produce something that works.  The latter spends all their time mentoring the junior engineers, who might or might not produce something that works, but it will undoubtedly be ugly and require much refactoring if it does.<p>Over longer timescales (years), this relationship doesn't hold true.  This is why Google, Microsoft, and many of the other big players in the industry can afford to hire junior engineers.  That one senior engineer and five junior engineers will turn into six senior engineers, all of whom have worked closely together, and then you have a gelled team that can accomplish great things.<p>But you have to get there first.  When a startup's fighting for its existence daily, it's not cost effective or prudent to make an investment that will take a couple years to pay off, when there's a good chance that your company will be out of business in six months.",1292212768

If you then parse those back into a native int at some later point and assume it won’t overflow, you’re really doing sloppy programming.</i><p>I find this to be a terrible example of what's sloppy.  Formatting as text is more portable, it's one of the tenets of the UNIX Philosophy.<p>If you encode numbers in binary, you also need to somehow communicate the endianness of the encoding (maybe this is standardized, and you always use htonl, but something still needs to know that you're using ""network order""), and you need to store how many bytes the number represents (because the int size on the target may be different a different size) , and you need to provide some way to easily convert back to a readable format for debugging.<p>By the OP's logic, SMTP and HTTP are ""sloppy"" because they are readable and easily debugable; admittedly, they are sloppy for other reasons, but not because they don't encode things in binary.",1292212692

Time Warner ??<p>But the article makes some valid points. When Netflix started it wasn't viewed as a direct threat to the content owners. Nflix served as the physical distribution arm (and a very very efficient one at that) for media houses. But now with streaming the game is changing.<p>Each of the players can now setup their own web based distribution base, why would they need Netflix anymore?<p>Plus there's more competition now. When Netflix launched it was the only one that did what it did (true bb tried, but they were poorly run). With streaming in addition to each Media conglomerates own websites there's also Hulu and lets not forget big dog Google (Youtube and Google TV).<p>In short content owners have options now, that didn't before.

It's a fallacy to think that somehow, we're collectively smarter than our grandparents when we all share the same human traits.<p>My main problem with this (apart from the unnecessary smearing) is that it continues with the thought that current market failures (housing, derivatives et al) is from letting free markets go.

1999190,comment,1998605,1998605,0,0,lkrubner,,,"It is unfortunate that, in the USA, the FDA and EPA keeps such a heavy lid on innovation in the biotech sector. Whereas the tech industry had the luck of being allowed to run relatively free for 50 years, the biotech industry needs to get approval for anything it might want to do. It seems to me likely that at some point in the 21st century the biotech sector might lead a revolution in the economy similar to what the tech sector was able to achieve 1960-2000, but sadly, the biotech sector faces so many checks and limits, that the pace of innovation will probably not be allowed to ever match what the tech sector achieved in the past.<p>Some have argued that the FDA needs to heavily regulate everything in biotech, so as to protect lives, but this argument cuts 2 ways - the heavy regulation also freezes out a certain amount of innovation that would also save lives. More so, the FDA insists that any treatment that is approved must  work for a known illness, and it has steadfastly refused to define ""aging"" as an illness, so no business can go after aging by itself and have any hope of meeting with regulatory approval. And aging is a major contributor to illness and death.<p>More so, the biotech industry includes a lot of areas of research that have nothing to do with human health, but these other applications of the technology tend to run into the regulatory limits of the EPA. Genetically engineered bacteria that can break down various toxins are useful, and have been approved. Genetically engineered organisms that have novel applications would have to work their way through an approval process that might take many, many years. All of this raises the costs of accomplishing anything. Millions of dollars get spent on lawyers, who haggle with the regulatory authorities - we can only dream of how much good might be accomplished if that money could be spent on research.<p>There are, of course, good arguments why these regulatory agencies should exist, but since they exist, they also must defend their legitimacy, which leads them to often exaggerate the dangers that they are, in theory, protecting us from. Thus defenders of the FDA paint a grim picture of what life would be like without it. And yet, the FDA, like any regulatory body, tends to be staffed by people who come from the industry that it is regulating, and so, over time, the FDA tends to develop a viewpoint in keeping with the industry. This is known as ""regulatory capture"". The worst aspect of this is that the regulatory bodies come to identify with the established players in an industry, while looking upon newcomers with a certain amount of unearned wariness.<p>The combination of regulatory capture and wariness of newcomers leads to situations where the FDA is slow to act against reports of e coli at a plant owned by a well known meat producer, while at the same time, acting slowly to allow novel uses of, say, stem cells to repair damaged tissues. Thus people die from those very things that the FDA was first enacted to protect us from (food poisoning - the FDA was created in part by public revulsion to what the public read in Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle), while at the same time the FDA ""protects"" people from novel treatments that might save lives.",1292211757

And falling prices and costs were indeed the welcome hallmark of industrial expansion during most of the nineteenth century.""  Planning for Freedom, p.247<p>The author explains that falling prices of this sort ""exhibits an exponential process of sorts when it is rapid . . . . As the currency becomes more valuable, it gets horded, and less is used for economic activity or lent out. What is the point if just holding it gets you regular returns? Less exchange leads to more deflation, and the system seizes up with nothing happening, unemployment prevalent, and no easy way out.""<p>So, to recap, the author seems to think that technological progress resulting in greater societal wealth and lower prices result in ""nothing happening"" and ""unemployment prevalent.""",1292210177

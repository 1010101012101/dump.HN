It'll save you a bunch of time if you just write the IA32e specific asm code.<p>If anyone has any interest, I can also post my adaptation of an asmx86 vim syntax file I hacked up from something I found on Stack Overflow.

I can't ever see it being a negative thing, but the difference between a toy kernel like he is proposing and a real system is larger than many people think. For example, knowing how to use the GDT and the LDT is definitely required, but knowledge of SMP design and general hardware architecture (think chip design, memory hierarchy, etc) are equally important. If you were looking for a career in systems design, definitely read the Intel Manuals cover to cover -- then go look at the Linux/BSD kernel to see where <i>things were explained so poorly that they may as well be wrong.</i> I would also highly encourage you to take part in a systems open source project (since I work on virtual machines, I would of course suggest Xen or QEMU).<p>If you like, a <i>much</i> simpler version of the Linux kernel, Kitten OS[1], is used  to run at Sandia and in sequence with the Palacios academic virtual machine[2], which is what I'm working on. It may be worth looking at, although I still highly recommend that you look into actual production code.<p>[1] <a href=""https://software.sandia.gov/trac/kitten"" rel=""nofollow"">https://software.sandia.gov/trac/kitten</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://v3vee.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://v3vee.org/</a>",1249365020

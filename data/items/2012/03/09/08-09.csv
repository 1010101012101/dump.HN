3683444,comment,3683202,3683375,10,0,jiggy2011,,,"I think it can still cost a great deal to produce content , let's take video games as an example.  GTA 4 cost approx $100 million to develop, even the much more modest ""angry birds"" cost around $100,000. \nEven equipment for recording and editing music to a high standard doesn't come cheap and the amount I have seen professional video/photography people pay for cameras alone is staggering.<p>This is not the kind of money most people have lying around, it has to come from somewhere.<p>Distribution is cheaper for sure, but you still have to factor in costs for bandwidth so it's not quite free although you may get some mileage from using a P2P system for some of the distribution. You also (in the case of software at least) need some sort of support infrastructure in place for when people have problems with your product. This means contracting out to a call centre or at least hiring someone to answer the emails.<p>I would hazard that many content companies spend quite a lot of money and time marketing their products which includes finding ways to pimp them on social media. If anything you have to do more to stand out now that there is so much noise, this means either spending more money or hiring smarter people to do your marketing (who probably want to get paid).<p>There are projects like kickstarter which offer an alternative way to finance works, of course it's early days yet so we will have to see how that works out.<p>The problem with ""pay what you want"" is that this is probably going to be as close to zero as you feel comfortable going. Even if you wanted to objectively try and pay a fair price , this will be affected by what you see other people paying.<p>A case in point would be the ardour music production software which is one of the few free software projects to have a full time programmer working on it who was not an employee of some corporate entity. However when you look at the donations he has received I'm surprised he is able to feed himself, bear in mind that this is pro level software which is actively used by enthusiasts and some pros. I think it would be difficult to agree that he is paid\nanything close to the value of what he produces.",1331283103

I can't help but see this as a good thing.<p>Especially when this is a physics based videogame where you learn to explore different solutions, test and refine your hypothesis, assess the stability of structures ...

3683439,comment,3679739,3681658,3,0,mooism2,,,"RFCs generally (or at least ""modern RFCs when I was paying attention"", which was about a decade ago) don't like to over-specify. e.g. RFC 2068 (HTTP/1.1) includes this paragraph:<p><i>HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used. This does not preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol on the Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only presumes a reliable transport; any protocol that provides such guarantees can be used; the mapping of the HTTP/1.1 request and response structures onto the transport data units of the protocol in question is outside the scope of this specification.</i><p>This makes clear that although you can use HTTP/1.1 over, say Unix domain sockets, and it would still work, and you could still call it HTTP/1.1, they expect it to be mostly used over TCP/IP port 80.<p>The language in the SPDY overview is probably the same sort of thing: making clear that they expect most usage to be over TCP, but allowing you to use something else if you really want to.<p>The TLS issue is probably intended to be the same thing: there's no reason why I shouldn't be able to use SPDY directly over TCP if the connection's between machines in my datacentre. But they don't make it explicit that they expect SPDY to run over TLS in normal use. Perhaps it's careless editing.",1331282762

So far, it's working pretty well, bit I'm still a newbie at sysadmin stuff.<p>We've even replaced all of the db migration & other common Rails rake tasks with a few short bash scripts and ~10 lines of Make.

3683375,comment,3683202,3683319,0,0,dissident,,,"> The economic benefit they provide to content creators is the financing to be able to create the content in the first place<p>Music, video games, application/software development are all areas where this is completely false -- very minimal financing is required for any of this and we already see a growing, open media landscape as a result of it. You seem to forget the capitalistic tendency for market potential to dictate the cost of services as well.<p>That is to say, Hollywood movie budgets are extremely over-inflated <i>because</i> of the monopolistic business models that guarantee them capital they do not require to finance the creation of content in the first place. Actors, directors and writers do not require millions of dollars to write or produce this content anymore. A market for its production -- or at the very least a social imperative -- would exist regardless of this artificial establishment.<p>Walk through this with me:<p>* it costs nothing to distribute the content anymore (in stark contrast with even a decade ago)<p>* it costs very little to create most content, and where it does costs a lot, it's mostly <i>because</i> of copyright's existence<p>* it costs nothing to market the content anymore. Social media is in a dominating role.<p>Copyright depended on all of these factors being completely opposite. It depended on some cost for creation, or more broadly, some quantifiable scarcity. It depended on a publisher -- an intermediary -- to connect the consumer with the creator. It eventually depended on advertising and extremely competitive marketing as well.<p>The realities of 21st century communication and technology simply are not compatible. Financing the production of works by selling the right to copy it is absurd in this economic climate. It made sense when publishing was a capital-intensive and narrow industry, but it now forms the basis by which many people communicate today.<p>Instead, works should be financed by the public interest in its creation. Nobody has to pay more than they want for their ""copy"" of the ""intellectual property"", the artist is subsidized as much as they transparently request, and perhaps an arbiter is compensated under contract.<p>Regardless, it is unenforceable and ultimately counter-productive to support copyright, just about anything could be better.",1331280701

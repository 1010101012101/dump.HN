9868325,comment,9865845,9867334,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"That point about popular adaption was good. It&#x27;s clear that what psychologists are debating and what happens on TV are different. Far as sociopath vs psychopath, psychologists tell me they&#x27;re both mostly pop-psych terms with meanings that vary due to who you&#x27;re talking to. The only one they mention is Anti-social Personality Disorder. I&#x27;m under the impression that they focus more on the potential psychopath&#x27;s individual traits and less on the categorization itself. I&#x27;ve seen some interesting categorizations which seemed to be there just to have one. They treated the symptoms.<p>He was an interesting character. He exhibited that kind of behavior. Yet, it could easily be his upbringing especially if growing up under and around hustlers. The guy might have never been taught better. So, I call that sort of thing bad character, a bit evil, but not all out psychopath in my book. This may not be everyone, but I tend to associate it with people who clearly have no conscience and seem to compulsively do these things. I&#x27;ve met them and they stand out from the average bad apple.<p>Either the article or a commenter mentioned them getting back at people years later. The inability to let go without doing what they were compelled to do. Many I&#x27;ve met had that trait, too. That&#x27;s why you figure out what pisses them off and avoid it. Assuming you can&#x27;t avoid them... (sighs)",1436583568

9868318,comment,9866755,9868289,0,0,axlprose,,,"The only thing I am saying, is that even mentioning negative events such as gamergate, triggers in readers the negative connotations associated with them, and it is a common tactic to sully opponent&#x27;s arguments for that reason. So when possible, it is good to avoid those kinds of unproductive remarks unless there&#x27;s a good tie-in, which so far there hasn&#x27;t been, and I already elaborated on why it doesn&#x27;t make any sense for there to be in my previous comment. If you seriously think that saying<p>> <i>those last two lines read to me like a callout to #gamergate&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s about ethics in journalism&quot; BS.</i><p>was just a simple &quot;This reminds me of gamergate&quot;, then you are the one putting words in people&#x27;s mouths. The intention lies in the words &quot;read to me like&quot;, implying that the original comment that was in response to, was invoking connotations of the gamergate event.<p>You are also applying the definitions of these fallacies you are mentioning rather selectively. Because if I am a hypocrite, then your argument that those gamergate parallels are more valid than the godwin invocations is equally hypocritical. A logical fallacy is not a matter of degree, it is a binary evaluation: either an argument is valid or it is not.",1436583457

I dont like tho mob rule aspect to her stepping down.<p>Her <i>job</i> was to preside over that mob.  And apparently to monetize it.  Pissing off that mob means <i>she failed at her job</i>.<p>In addition, not understanding that you are firing a key employee shows a <i>dramatic</i> level of ignorance.  Reddit has so few employees that even an adequate CEO should know what every single employee is doing.  This is just basic Management 101--&quot;Know What Your People Do&quot; or its corollary &quot;Never Piss Off A Secretary&quot; aka &quot;Know Who Has The Real Power In Your Company&quot;.<p>Finally, from her attempt at PR positioning you get headlines like this: &quot;It’s Silicon Valley 2, Ellen Pao 0: Fighter of Sexism Is Out at Reddit&quot;.  Really?  &quot;Fighter of sexism&quot;.  Um, she fired a woman, you know?  And her behavior at Kleiner was far from exemplary.  Her case for sexism would have been a whole lot stronger if she hadn&#x27;t appeared to be sleeping her way up the corporate chain.<p>Overall, the problem seems to be the same tone-deafness as so many at this level of privilege: &quot;The rules don&#x27;t apply to me.

There, the bank repossesses and sells the underlying asset so the only time they can ever lose is if housing prices crash. Presumably student loans are secured-by-fiat for precisely this reason.<p>Financial gamers inherently desire airtight abstractions so they can leverage the heck out of them. But this doesn&#x27;t mean they should get this wish, since the purpose of the financial system isn&#x27;t simply to perpetuate itself but to optimize for people.<p>Everyone needs a place to live, so under financial primacy the only limit on housing prices in a developed area is the economic rent on the principal.

According to google, the most concrete definition of &quot;misogyny&quot; is:  &quot;an <i>ingrained</i> prejudice against <i>women</i>.&quot;<p>So immediately there are 2 problems here:<p>1.) Ellen Pao does not represent all women, nor would all women agree for her to represent them most likely. So dislike of Pao does not conclusively imply a dislike of women in general. Especially when we keep in mind the context of people being upset about a <i>female</i> employee being fired.<p>2.) Even if we assume that yes, Ellen Pao did represent all women, that still does not imply that the public&#x27;s sentiments against her were somehow &quot;ingrained&quot; or unjustified. She did decide to ban several subreddits before the latest incident with Victoria (which may or may not have involved Pao). The anger may have been unjustly directed towards her specifically when it should&#x27;ve been directed towards Reddit management in general, but being a lightning rod for bad press has always been an unspoken the function of CEOs. It may not conclusively prove that the anger directed at her was purely due to management issues, but it does cast doubt about it being because she was a woman.<p>So the issue here is not that something can&#x27;t be pseudo-objective if enough people agree, it&#x27;s that the claim is not specific enough to be meaningful, and these kinds of terms are usually just used as social trump cards that discourage questioning, which again, is the opposite of what journalism is supposed to be about.",1436582646

If you were right, then you seeing it led to a feeling of being violated, potentially shortness of breath, lost sleep, and possibly post-traumatic stress disorder. Is this how you feel?<p>Your other point makes sense. I think it&#x27;s what your getting at. How people categorize other people can lead to them harming them and often does. This is part of human nature I&#x27;m afraid: shows up everywhere with every kind of people with very few exceptions. Your boss vs employee example is decent until you take it to the extreme to support your agenda. An extreme that&#x27;s rare.<p>Now, let&#x27;s try a different take with an actual person in my categorization. He&#x27;s a nice-looking, sharply-dressed, young manager from a fairly typical family with typical good and bad per people that grew up with him. He picks fights with underlings who are good workers but don&#x27;t play politics (image worse than him). He wittily cuts them, sets them up for problems, and has enjoyment in his eyes. He regularly deceives both new hires and existing staff in games that benefit him at their other expense. Far from remorse, the more agony and rage people break out into the more there&#x27;s a glimmer in his eyes. His calm, confident, and apparently caring demeanor around most employees and other management ensure his victim&#x27;s rage fit appears to be their own personal problems. He cunningly tells a believable story that pushes all the right buttons. They quit. If anything, he&#x27;s good at getting troubling workers out of the place the others think with some on the fence and a few seeing his game but quiet.<p>I call him a psychopath, born or learned, because he acts like one. His victims used the same word although it&#x27;s certainly a pop psych term & that&#x27;s expected. How would you describe this person to a third party, especially a layperson, that captured these traits adequately?<p>Note: He eventually did leave the place... in handcuffs... for allegedly fondling his hot gf&#x27;s... daughter. The look on his face in the mugshot wasn&#x27;t shame or guilt. It was a look I&#x27;ve seen 100+ times on kids & teens: &quot;Shit I got caught.&quot;",1436582468

For example, do they not then appear to support whatever they do not ban if we know that whatever sufficiently offends them gets the ban hammer?<p>For another example, take Google removing Confederate flags.

As they imply in the video, and from my own (admittedly rather limited) experience, the hard part is selecting the correct algorithm for the job and tuning the parameters just right. Although this is mitigated by so-called &quot;great estimators&quot; like Neural Networks, achieving the highest accuracy requires both a Machine Learning background and a decent knowledge of the problem space (i.e. domain knowledge). Is over-fitting likely to be an issue? Is there a class imbalance? Are the classes undergoing concept drift? How costly are false positives and false negatives?<p>This is simply another example of a trend that has been driving computers, and technology in general, since at least the industrial revolution: <i>abstraction</i>. Although abstracting away the complex to present an easy-to-use and universally accessible interface has been going on since before computers were even invented, this specific instance strikes me as radically different. Microsoft could be enabling billions of people around the world to deploy their own personal pseudo-AIs. Trying to decide what stocks to invest in? Deploy an AI to crunch the numbers. Not sure whether that girl in your class likes you? Ask an AI to assess the situation. Want to confirm if a country has nuclear weapons? Analyse the media with an AI.<p>On the negative side I worry that too much abstraction could be wholly misleading. After all, there are still many people who take everything said in the media or on the internet at face value. What if the oracle is wrong in a life-or-death situation? What if it&#x27;s right in a malicious application? In this age of big data and non-privacy, just how scary are the potential abuse cases for a project like this? Moreover, will these pseudo-AIs just become another source of lying statistics due to flawed assumptions and implementation?<p>At the same time I look forward to increased adoption of computer decision making. Implemented correctly, a computer algorithm comes closer to true impartiality than most humans ever could. They do not get tired or distracted. For example, I cannot wait for the day when cars are driven by computers.<p>I can speculate about the ethical and physical ramifications of personal AIs until the sun blows up, but I think what&#x27;s more important to consider is what comes a few steps after this in the &quot;evolution of Machine Learning&quot;.<p>What do we do when we reach the <i>singularity</i>?<p>We&#x27;re getting closer and closer every year.

There is a very loud minority angrily decrying people who post pro-male articles and such, and the news and media are not interested in it unless it is to point out that he was a MRA killer from 4chan.<p>That being said, I have become apathetic to these tropic debates (women in tech, gamergate, feminism v antifeminsim, etc) and now just largely support free speech and freedom of expression.

That&#x27;s laughable.<p>Privacy only rewards liers and cheaters, and generally unreliable people. It leads to a world where kids tell their teachers what they want to hear, where politicians tell the population what they want to hear, where job candidates tell the interviewer what he wants to hear. You can&#x27;t cheat, lie, manipulate and generate bullshit? Sorry, but that&#x27;s an handicap in today&#x27;s society.<p>We live in a world where it&#x27;s expected of people to keep secrets and conceal the truth.

You can&#x27;t ask for help publicly, that would reveal you&#x27;re imperfect. Keep it in, live in the closet. Oh, and be a white male.<p>Don&#x27;t forget, one picture of you being drunk or smoking a joint, and your political carrier is over.

From its web site, &quot;The Genome Browser, Blat, and liftOver source are freely downloadable for academic, noncommercial, and personal use. For information on commercial licensing, see the Genome Browser and Blat licensing requirements.&quot; Were you working in a for-profit genetics lab when you realized that FOSS was so important? Otherwise, how would a restriction like the UCSC one have affected you?<p>4. I actually think the FOSS vs. licensing cost are somewhat orthogonal issues. I distribute my software under the MIT license, but only to those people who pay me about US $25,000. This is something the FSF encourages, as a way to bring revenue to a project. However, it only works because I&#x27;m not trying to establish some sort of &quot;community&quot; but prefer a vendor/customer relationship.<p>BTW, I think points #1, #2, #3, and #5 can be recast as &quot;you need to build a community around your project.&quot; I think that&#x27;s a myth in its own right.",1436580085

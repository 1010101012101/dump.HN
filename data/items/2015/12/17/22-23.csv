Spending more time on the topic at this point is pointless.<p>Or, give them the answer and see what they can do with the information. IE, pretend that they DID lookup the answer and go from there. Did they grasp the concept? Could they make logical inferences from that new concept? If they can&#x27;t do it when you tell them the answer, why would you think they could if Google told them it instead?",1450393198

For us humans it usually consists of access to (in decreasing order of importance) oxygen, water, nutrition, shelter, closure, etc. If an AI was free of all these constraints - meaning it had no predetermined utility function to maximize - then what is it supposed to do? It would have no motivation, no reason to learn or do anything. And if it had no goals which it tries to reach, how could we determine its performance or rather its intelligence?",1450393106
10755271,comment,10754487,10755109,0,0,AJ007,,,"That was the way I have been looking at it.<p>It is not just an issue of finding solutions to impossible problems, or breaking scientific laws, but also problems where the solutions are along the lines of what George Soros would call reflexive. Computer security is like this, so is securities trading (no pun.)<p>Secondly, what about problems which require the destruction of the problem solvers along the path to the optimal solution? I&#x27;m not sure about the correct word to describe this, or the best example but it could be seen in large systems. Where humans are right now is a result of this. We would not know many things if those things which came before were not destroyed (cities, 1000 year empires, etc.)<p>Thirdly, is a uniform, singular AI the most optimal agent to solve these sorts of problems? Much the way we don&#x27;t rely or use mainframes for computing today, perhaps there will be many AI agents each which may be really good at solving particular narrowly defined problem sets. This could be described perhaps as a swarm AI.<p>Nick Bostrom&#x27;s Superintelligence is a great book, but I don&#x27;t recall much consideration along these lines. When a lot of AI agents are &quot;live&quot; the paths to solutions where AI compete against each other open up even more complex scenarios.<p>There certainly are physical limitations to AI. Things like the speed of light can slow down processing. Consumption of energy. Physical elements that can be assembled for computational purposes.<p>Between now and &quot;super&quot; AI, even really good AI could struggle to find solutions to the most difficult problems, especially if those are problems other AI are creating. The speed alone may be the largest challenge to humans. How do we measure this difficulty relative to human capabilities, I don&#x27;t know.<p>End of rant -- but the limits of not just AI but problem solving is quite interesting.",1450393102

10755266,comment,10754487,10754940,0,0,sawwit,,,"I think one of the best evidences we have is the level at which computers outperform the human mind in certain domains. An artificial general intelligence would have very low latency access to all these mathematical and computational tools we&#x27;ve invented (physical simulations, databases, theorem provers), and it would not need to mechanically enter program code on a keyboard, but it would be directly wired to the compiler. It could possibly learn to think in program code and execute it on the fly.<p>The computation environment of neurons is also extremely noisy (axons are not well insulated) and neurons only fire at 7-200Hz. Assuming noise and low firing rate do not fulfill a certain task in mammalian brains, this is another way in which silicon-based minds could potentially be vastly superior.<p>Thirdly, assuming sleep is not necessary for intelligence, artificial minds would never get exhausted. They could work 24 hours on a problem a day, which is possibly 5-10 time the amount of thinking time a human can do realistically.<p>And lastly, an AI could easily make copies of itself. Doing so it could branch a certain problem to many computers which run copies of it and eventually collect the best result, or just shorten the time it takes to get a result. It could also evolve at a much faster rate than humans, assuming it has a genetic description: possibly hours to seconds instead of 20 years. Anyhow, it could easily perform experiments with slightly changed version of itself.",1450393065

It&#x27;s exponentially inefficient to try to recognize &quot;dog&quot; until you have recognized that the simpler &quot;animal&quot; is a good approximation.<p>I also think that in the ultimate solution, the output leaf statements of the grammar will be parametrized like a normal programming language, so that for example, the algorithm can generate a color, a radius and then generate 100 circles referencing this single color and radius to represent repeated patterns without having to learn their size and color individually when they are clearly homogeneous or invariant across a bunch. The bayesian, occam&#x27;s razor, solution to a bunch of similar things that you don&#x27;t have a category for yet is shared parameters. These parameters enable learning with very few examples. The algorithm doesn&#x27;t have to learn a full new category to make good predictions, it can simply notice a functional parametric pattern in a part of a scene and extrapolate immediately.<p>I haven&#x27;t cracked it however.

As you note, each has some magic mixing function to get some output that&#x27;s (hopefully) entirely uncorrelated to your input, but the specifics are a bit different.<p>When you encrypt something, the output is the same size as the input. The key is not mutated.  You have to be able to go the other way if you know the key (for symmetric encryption).<p>When you hash something, the input is variable but the output length is fixed.  Typically this is one-way - you should not be able to reconstruct the input for a given output.<p>When you have a stateful PRNG you get a fixed-length output but you have some internal state that gets changed with every call. So its inputs are generate(state) and you yield output and newstate.  Going the other way is possible in theory but not typical.<p>The state for PRNGs is usually larger than the amount of output yielded, sometimes by quite a lot. E.g. Mersenne Twister has about 2.5 KB of state but yields only 32 bits of output per iteration. You generally want to store newstate every time, because setting them up is often expensive (MT takes a lot of calls before it&#x27;s fully initialized and providing good randomness) and iterating through N-1 steps every time can take a very long time in a long-running program.<p>Usually you want PRNGs to be fast (but strongly random), but encryption and hashing should sometimes be slow (eg to protect passwords in a DB, or as a proof-of-work as in Bitcoin/Hashcash). It all depends on what role you&#x27;re using them in.<p>You can sorta compose them into each other - like you can make a stateful PRNG by doing a hash on some internal state and then mixing some of it back into the state (eg like RDRAND).  Or by encrypting a counter with a seed to make a PRNG (like Random123).  Here be dragons, though - there&#x27;s nothing guaranteeing your hand-rolled encryption algorithm will actually resist an attack, or whatever.

The human brain is limited by its slow speed, by the amount of cortical mass you can fit inside a human skull, and by the length of human lifetimes. Computers will not have any of those limitations.<p>In terms of speed: if you could build the exact silicon equivalent of a human brain, you may be able to run it several orders of magnitude faster, simply because it wouldn&#x27;t be limited by the slow speeds of electrochemical processes in the human brain. Nerve impulses travel at speeds measured in meters per second. Neurons also need time to recharge between spike bursts, and they can physically damage themselves if they get too excited.<p>In terms of volume: much of our intelligence is in perceiving patterns. That&#x27;s limited by cortical mass. Pattern recognition is what all these &quot;deep learning&quot; systems excel at. The more depth they add, the better they get. Having deeper pattern recognizers, or simply having more of them, means you can see more patterns, more complex patterns, etc. Things that might be beyond the reach of any human.<p>Then, in terms of data, machine have an advantage too. We&#x27;re limited by our short lifetimes. How many people are expert musicians, genius mathematicians, rockstar programmers and great cooks? Very few.

If you think about it, the average person can fit 7-8 items in their short-term memory, in their brain&#x27;s &quot;registers&quot;, so to speak. That probably limits our ability to reason by analogy.

10755076,comment,10753574,10754977,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Some reasons:<p>1. Web code is portable. The Java dream of “write once, run anywhere” is alive on the web. All you need to run a web app is a device with a browser. No need for a specific CPU architecture or operating system.<p>2. Web code is accessible. Just click a link and BAM. No need to download anything, no need to install anything, no need to worry about where to put something you might not want later. The web is the lowest friction platform (for users/customers) yet created. Even better, it’s easy to access web data from anywhere in the world on any device: I can read my web email on my grandma’s iPad or on the library’s computer or on a 10-year-old backup laptop, without worrying about whether I’ll have the data I need.<p>3. Web code is mostly safe. Anything that runs in a webpage is theoretically sandboxed away from harming other webpages or user data stored locally, and web users have come to expect that clicking arbitrary links won’t harm their computers. Untrusted blobs of compiled C code are a completely different story.<p>4. Web products can very easily be kept up-to-date for all users. This is double-edged for customers, because often website feature changes make later versions more confusing or less effective than earlier versions (cf. most Google product changes from 2008–present). For developers though, it dramatically simplifies support, because every customer can be presumed to be running the latest software version.<p>The big question is, what do you mean by “everything”? I don’t think everything is being put on the web, or should be. For example, professional “content creation” software is not going to be put on the web anytime in the next few years, because the initial barrier to entry is small in comparison to the required time investment to learn and use the software, and because such applications need hardware access and fine-grained control over compute resources.",1450391444

This has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;knowing how to use a computer&quot;.<p>Personal anecdote: I like building programming environments- sandboxes for playing with unusual languages. My target audience is people who are interested in programming and generally people who are very computer literate.<p>I spent about 3 years working on a complete development toolchain for a fantasy game console- compilers, profilers, documentation, examples- the works. It was spread around, and has hundreds of stars on github. Problem: you need to have a java compiler on your system to install and work with the tools. Number of people who developed programs using these tools aside from me: close to zero.<p>More recently, I built a browser-based IDE for another obscure game console. I made a complete toolchain, wrote docs, loads of examples, etc. This time, though, you could share your programs with a hyperlink, and there was no installation required. You could easily remix other people&#x27;s programs from a public computer. The difference was huge. Dozens of other people wrote hundreds of programs using this system over a matter of months.<p>If you&#x27;re making a project you want to share with other people, a web browser removes friction to a degree which cannot be underestimated.

The middleware is HoF around these so it&#x27;s done per-handler as well as at the base reducer level, which turns out to be really good for code reuse.<p>> Is that the subscription mechanism? I have yet to find a use for it...<p>I think they call it selections. Reactions let you transform a normalized data model into a shape that&#x27;s useful for the components.

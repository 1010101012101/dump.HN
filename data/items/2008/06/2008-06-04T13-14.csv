Being able to take a power nap at times also helps.<p>I used to work 12-14hrs/day and be highly productive (80/20 rule) as once tasks got boring or my mind started to wonder I would nap for half hour before doing a completly different task e..g. from coding to creating designs in photoshop, which was different enough to use different parts of my mind and thought processes. A change is as good as a holiday.<p>Most projects were completed as quickly as I could do and because they did not drag-on and because I was able to make lots of headway (reward in itself) I could sustain this for several weeks at a time.<p>Afterwards I would always take a some time off though :)",1212587518

208906,comment,208736,208736,0,0,dhs,,,"Where to begin? Here, Michael Crichton links ""global warming"" with ""eugenics"", and the fate of critics of the former with the fate of critics of the latter. Yes, he's talking about ""critics of global warming"", not about ""critics of the theory that global warming is caused by humans"".<p>To me, the dispute seems not to be to be about whether the globe is warming up, but about whether we have caused this warming-up, about whether we can prevent and/or reverse it, and also about whether the activities of us puny humans can have a significant impact on the system at all. Ok, his might be excused as some ""shorthand formulation"". but he's making judgments of science and of scientists here, so I'd think that some precision would be in order.<p>Anyway... eugenics. Crichton describes eugenics as a form of politicized science, which caused  people to be discriminated against, sterilized, and even killed in large numbers. It was bad.<p>About two thirds through his text, he cites another example of politicized science: Lysenkoism. Trofim Lysenko was a Russian biologist who speculated that aquired characteristics of plants (and presumably other organisms) could be inherited, and that soaking wheat grains in water and burying the wet seed in snow over the winter would improve crop yields. During the time from 1948 to 1964, criticism of Lysenko's theories was formally outlawed in the Soviet Union; academic critics were thrown in jail. As a consequence of such foolish behavior, many people died through famine. It was bad.<p>In the final quarter, then, he brings on global warming:<p>""Once again, critics are few and harshly dealt with.""<p>Oh, really? What happens to them? Are they jailed, or killed? Crichton doesn't say. Instead, he says:<p>""Once again, claims of moral superiority are used to justify extreme actions.""<p>What kind of extreme actions are taken? Are those actions comparable with those he cites, like letting peasants starve, sterilizing ""feeble-minded"" Californians, or killing Jews in concentration camps? He doesn't say. But:<p>""Once again, the fact that some people are hurt is shrugged off because an abstract cause is said to be greater than any human consequences.""<p>Ah, some people are hurt. So it must be bad. But how are they hurt? Are they starved, jailed, killed? Does he refer to the critics again, or to some other people? Not a word about it...<p>I don't know whether or not human activities cause/prevent global warming. I believe that the jury's still out on that. But if, as Crichton writes, he really wishes that ""knowledge is disinterested and honest"", I think he should refrain from drawing the kind of comparisons he draws here. This text reads like scientizied politics. In fact, as a source of knowledge, it's indistinguishable from politicized science to me.",1212586789

208897,comment,208736,208890,0,0,Tichy,,,"Granted, the one about the retired professors was the one single argument it gives. Other than that, just because a theory is not popular, doesn't prove that it is right. I am pretty sure that if you want funding for research into the Spaghetti Monster, you might as well also be fired. That is why I did not like the article - it suggests public outrage is a proof that there is something to the theory, but it is not a proof (nor does it prove the opposite).<p>Not saying that I like the academic system - I think there is always a lot of politics involved. I am amazed by the kinds of things that get funding. For example there are whole conferences on ""consciousness"", something that I personally believe to be a complete chimera (or take religion - in Europe you can take up religion as a subject at university, not sure about the US). So people meet on those conferences and talk about what? They can not even give a definition of the subject...",1212586068

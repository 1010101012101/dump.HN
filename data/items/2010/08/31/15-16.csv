It's the SEO shenanigans that get my blood angry. The info graphics that point back to a bullshit affiliate-laden webpage like onlineeducation.net that actually serves no REAL purpose.<p>What you said here:\n====================\nThe Internet isn't a store front that people are forced to walk by. Without a marketing strategy your site does not exist.\n====================<p>Is really damn spot on... I write and treat it like it is... like Google or whoever will find the content. I just assumed it would, but I can't compete with the noise level created by other sources blasting links to their own articles on the same topics.<p>I do submit bigger/more detailed pieces to the social news sites. I got banned from reddit for doing it, then an admin reviewed all my links and unbanned me... that was awesome, really endeared me to that community. Digg I'm auto-buried on for doing it for no reason... again, no spam crap links, just stuff I've been writing.<p>Slashdot I've been fortunate with about 10 times in the last few years which I'm hugely thankful for... but at the end of the month I don't think it really changed much except for the temporary spikes in traffic.<p>I believe my biggest problem is I just want to write. I don't want to have to have those marketing problems that the current state of the web is forcing me to have... I'm resistant to it because I'm resentful of it.<p>It is the whole ""get good grades in school and you will be a success!"" crap all over again. Then you see the kid that kept failing do 10x better than you and you are so damn mad about focusing on your grades the whole time that your ego won't let you see 10 feet infront of you.<p>I think that is where I am right now. No ETA yet on when I'll be coming out the other site :)",1283270385

It is Barbara Liskov's attempt to formalize the Liskov Substitution Principle.<p>I dare say that she knows her own intent better than you do.  It is also unsurprising if her formulation is imperfect.<p>In a practical world what the LSP means is that you should be able to replace an object of a given type with another object of any subtype and it should still work.  If it doesn't, then that wasn't really a subtype.  As you correctly pointed out, the challenge in dynamic languages with exception handling is that it is possible to write code that depends on a particular method not existing.  Similar code in C++ would give a compilation error.  Therefore no subtype can quite be perfect in some languages.<p>Still even though perfection is impossible, it is good to be aware of the principle, and adhere to it as closely as is practical.  Meaning make your changes be one that will break the smallest amount of code that your code change is likely to encounter at any point in the future.",1283269994

Only about a year ago I finally tossed all the old floppies, but I kept several thinking I might write an Amiga retrospective someday.<p>Here are some highlights. It's been a long time, so I'm sure to make some technical mistakes.<p>Rexx Plus Compiler -- by Dineen Edwards Group;\nImplementation of the Rexx language (ARexx).

ARexx was one of the things that kept the Amiga alive.<p>UEdit -- by Rick Stiles;\nOne of the first great things available for the Amiga. A highly programmable editor. If Rick hadn't passed away too soon UEdit may well have lived on past the Amiga.<p>Migraph OCR -- by Migraph, Inc.; \nI was scanning financial data from Investors Business Daily, compiled quite a database.<p>Descartes! -- by Mindware International;\nSome sort of AI-ish thingy I never found a use for.<p>Magellan -- by Emerald Intelligence;\nExpert System generator I never found a use for. The company ran into some sort of trademark infringement and later renamed it <i>Mahogany</i>.<p>Boole -- by URSIC Computing;\nFuzzy logic and Bayesian Inference. Actually a DOS program, but you could run it on the Amiga.<p>The Amiga was really a hacker's machine. Thanks to programs like ARexx and UEdit you could really do some interesting stuff at a time when a DOS computer mostly just ran stand-alone programs. It was greatly stymied by Commodore's terrible marketing and lack of commercial applications.<p>I think in a way I was scarred by investing so much learning effort in a technology that dead-ended.

The (aptly named) unification grammar, lexicon, and most of the productive lexicon are written in a declarative manner.<p>This really paid off when in a new research project, which goal is to write a sentence realizer for the same system. With nearly no modifications we could reuse the grammar, lexicon, and productive lexicon. Both the parser and the sentence realizer use the same grammar and lexicon now.<p>I understand that this may seem somewhat trivial, as it may seem that the lexicon and grammar are plain data. However this is not true:<p>- The grammar is written as a declarative manner, where goals are mostly operators that manipulate attribute-value structures. These rules are later compiled to plain Prolog terms via term expansion (DCG-like) for efficiency.\n- You don't want to perform some unifications immediately, even when two terms are unified. Most Prolog implementations offer blocked goals, where a goal is blocked until a variable becomes instantiated.<p>However, I am the first to admit that Prolog makes some classes of problems trivial (unification grammars, parsers). There are also many things that you do not want to do in Prolog, because it is a waste of time, or very inefficient. For instance, in our system the following components are implemented in C or C++:<p>* Finite state automata for quick lookup of subcategorization frames.<p>* Part-of-speech tagger for restricting the number of frames for each word before parsing.<p>* N-gram models that are used as a feature in fluency estimation.<p>* Tokenization transducer.<p>* Bit arrays (comparable to Bloom filters) for excluding useless paths in parsing.<p>Conclusion: use the right tool for the job. Unification, structure sharing, and (some) pattern matching are cheap and easy to use in (WAM) Prolog. Most other things are prohibitively expensive and clumsy in Prolog.",1283268485

Instead of trying every possible combination of choices and failing/backtracking as early as possible (generate-and-test), it can use constraints to narrow the intervals / sets of possible choices - which usually sets off a chain reaction and further constrains the search space.<p>Once constraint propagation can't narrow things any further, it can copy the search space, use various search hueristics (such as splitting each copy of the narrowest interval in half), and see if that triggers further constraint propagation (or hits a dead end). It usually <i>greatly</i> reduces the amount of depth-first search. There are other ways of implementing constraints besides propagator-networks and space copying, but that's the way I understand best.<p>Generate-and-test is great for prototyping, but doesn't scale up to larger problems. Constraint programming fares much better.",1283268301

The first issue is that you don't know if the problem is you, your team, or one that you created with your team.<p>I think you need to get that sorted first -- the suggestions for a mentor to come in and spend a day or two with you are spot on. Do this first, because if you choose the wrong option above, you're going to be in for some horrible pain, much worse than you are now.<p>You reference telecommuting and said you thought telecommuting was the 'way to go.' Here's my experience: I managed a technology startup in an office for nine years with no telecommuters, and have since done three years of management of remote teams, working out of an office and at home, so I've been on both sides of this.<p>Whatever 37Signals seems to imply on their blog posts, remote management of knowledge workers is more challenging than in-office management. (And, I'm sure that they would agree with this statement, by the way). There is one exception to this rule: it is if the team is self-motivated, self-organizing and has good chemistry and an excellent remote decision making process.<p>Something many entrepreneurs miss (or at least that I missed for many years) is that not everyone wants to be an entrpreneur. Whatever else may be true about your company, I know from your descriptions that your employees don't want to be entrepreneurs. They want to be salaried employees, I'm sure with bonuses and stock if possible.<p>When you read about how telecommuting rocks, and the team just works really hard and talks all the time using skype or iChat, etc. etc., and there is no management overhead and no wasted time, and people are naturally agile, and everything is awesome, you are reading about a group of people who all wanted to be entrepreneurs and found each other online.<p>You're not in that situation; instead you're in a more-challenging-than-usual management situation where you can't evaluate body language, team dynamics, emotional affect, work groupings (as in who works well with whom). All that has to be inferred or discovered or just left as a mystery. In all likelihood, you have a seriously toxic work environment on your hands, one that is negatively impacting your 'good' employees as well as the 'problem ones.'<p>Now, to solutions:<p>If the problem is mostly you, and you actually generally have good people, you're lucky! You can work extra hard at becoming a better manager. There are lots of great suggestions here, including more frequent short one-on-one meetings, providing better work structure for employees and getting some management coaching. Do all of these. Also, start reading some business books about management, rather than just HN, as great as it is. There are many, many excellent management books (and, sadly a whole load of total crap) at the bookstore; go browse and buy four or five. Read them. Talk about them with your coach or mentor. Implement. You'll probably find you need to sort some things out with some of your employees. Do that. You'll probably find you can't live with some of your employees, even with your new management skills. Have them leave, but do so in a respectful way. Things will improve.<p>Now, if (as seems likely to me), you've participated in creating a problematic culture, you have some more work ahead of you: you're going to have to manage your company back around to a better culture, without losing half your team.<p>Consider: could the half you want to get rid of re-implement your technology? Since they work in different countries, would you have a legal solution to that? If the answers are: 'yes' and 'hmm....', tread carefully!<p>If instead you have a lock on the technology and you know you need a reset, you should process this, first with your most trusted senior employee. Tell them you're considering a reset because you're convinced the culture is not solvable. (Note that you definitely owe it to your employees to work on your own management needs before you go down this path.) Get their feedback, it will be instructive. Work together to get a transition plan in place.<p>I have more thoughts in this vein, but perhaps you get the thrust of my opinions. Best of luck.",1283267859

Because---and here I link to the original article---the fight is far from over.<p>If Flash will eventually disappear it will be slowly, very slowly. Companies are reluctant to get into new technologies. Has DVD disappeared because of Blu-ray? Has Windows XP disappeared because of Windows 7? What about Internet Explorer? And it's the same outside of the tech industry too.<p>Some sites will be early adopters, some will be slowpokes and most will be somewhere in the middle. And in this last year we've seen a _lot_ of mindshare being gained by HTML5. For a start Youtube, Vimeo and friends. Let's remember that a couple of years ago Flash was basically had the whole market by itself.<p>I don't know if the iPad/iPod helped, but I do know that Flash is starting to lose its grip. And yes, of course people will still develop on Flash for many years to come, the same way some companies were still selling VHS players a couple of years ago.

When I finished highschool I thought I was pretty damn smart and had a lot of things figured out (clearly not the case).  From an academic point of view as I worked towards my Ph.D. I was constantly reminded of how very little I did know.  While I did learn new things day by day, my appreciation for how much I didn't know grew exponentially.  In fact I think what I'm left with after the whole exercise is not a confidence in my knowledge but rather a confidence in my ability to learn, problem solve and ask questions.",1283267074

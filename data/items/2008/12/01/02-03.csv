Switching out the data access code itself with something more robust, while still maintaining the overall Model architecture is in fact encouraged.

Well that's the way <i>'theregister'</i> likes to tell it.<p>The ideas behind the <i>""6 degrees of separation""</i> are measurable and form a new type of science, not surprisingly called Network theory. The ideas behind them instead of being debunked are strengthening. In '99, <i>""Duncan Watts""</i> ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Watts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Watts</a> and <i>""Steven Strogatz""</i> ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Strogatz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Strogatz</a> wrote a paper submitted to Nature working on the <i>""Small World theory""</i> problem called <i>""Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks""</i> . Their results tend to support the idea that there is a measurable, finite, minimum number of links in a network between nodes and that clustering of node links does occur.  The idea applied to various other natural networks (Actors in Hollywood, neural networks in the brain, Transmission lines across the US) also support the conclusions.<p><pre><code>   ""... a scale-free network is a network \n    whose degree distribution follows a \n    power law ..."" \n</code></pre>\nThen consider <i>""Albert-László Barabási""</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.nd.edu/~sciwww/Faculty/barabasi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nd.edu/~sciwww/Faculty/barabasi.html</a> who who picked up the Watts-Strogatz work ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_and_Strogatz_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_and_Strogatz_model</a> and came up with the idea of <i>""Scale free networks""</i> ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_networks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_networks</a> which gives probably the most important insight into how networks cluster, Hubs.<p>I don't just believe the ideas of Watts, Strogatz and Barabási because of who they are but what their experiments reveal.",1228097135

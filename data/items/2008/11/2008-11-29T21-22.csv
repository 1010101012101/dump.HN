There are so many examples of athletes who are / were the best in their arena that certainly were not the ideal ""type"" for their sport.  Just look at Wayne Gretzky - 6'/180lb.  Barry Sanders - 5'8...<p>For athletes like a football quarterback, it's not even about being good at a single thing (fast-twitch sprinting).  It's such a multi-dimensional position that just having fast-twitch speed is not going to guarantee you're the next Joe Montana or Tom Brady.<p>And finally, so many people have the talent but don't have the work ethic and drive to make the most of it.  The people who are out there every single day for hours - throwing, kicking, sprinting, etc.  That first 10% might be genetics, but the rest of it is blood, sweat, and working so hard some days you come home and puke.",1227995793

A good title will get an article several times more attention. I've found that the most effective titles (a) say what the article is about, and (b) appeal directly to the reader.<p>For example, the original title of ""Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas"" was ""Copper and Tin.""  It was a bogus move to name the thing after a metaphor I was proud of, and I got what I deserved.  Who's going to click on a link titled ""Copper and Tin?""  You can't tell what it's going to be about, whatever it does turn out to be about probably won't affect you.<p>The titles that seem to work the best are ones that to answer some question the reader cares about.  E.g. ""Why you procrastinate.""  The most effective of all seem to be the ones that promise (usually falsely) to cover <i>all</i> of some question, and embody this promise in a number: ""The 7 reasons you procrastinate.""<p>You don't necessarily want to sink to using such linkbaitish titles-- especially here, please-- but they certainly work.",1227995626

You basically have 13 + 17 - 6 == 24k in debt.  If you go bankrupt with the company, that drops to just 13k (assuming that it's not secured with your private finances).<p>You say there are no finished products, then go on to say there's a good advertising/leads platform.  Can you spend a few weeks pounding pavement and looking to sell or lease that platform?  Start a new company, and go for it.  Remember to sell both the platform and your knowledge as a consultant.  You only really need to find one or two decent clients for that to work out well (rather than a dozen for just selling blackbox software).<p>You'll be in for a rough time, but a part time job would help smooth out the financial bumps while you get a new company up and running.

380388,comment,380099,380099,0,0,markessien,,,"Animals in general always tend towards two binary opposite behaviours, each of which is more successful in certain enviroments. It's a sort of hedging of the bets, in case unexpected situations spring up. As such, there will always be extremes of both behaviours - the bird that takes more risk to get the worm, and the other bird that takes less risk. Depending on the external situation, one of the two types will always dominate.<p>It's my belief that the concentration of genetic tendencies is what is causing the increase - people from universities tend to marry people from universities, and so there is a similarity in tendency among people who are reproducing, and so there is a larger tendencies for the extremes to manifest themselves.<p>It's like the sickle cell gene - when the population is diverse, this gene hardly shows up as a disease, but when the community is closed, the disease comes up very often.",1227995275

If the physical and human assets of the Big 3 went on the market, Toyota and others would swoop in and buy them up, bring it up to date, and hire those recently unemployed workers to build cars for the US economy and to export.

I went to physics grad school and am friends with some quantum cryptographers, and there's still no way I'm going to read the physics one -- not because it's uninteresting but because I have no time. (Indeed, I'm being dragged out the door right now.)<p>Ditto the software estimation one. It's a whole research paper. In the words of Bruce Sterling, it's like chloroform on the screen.<p>If you want to motivate folks to read and upmod on these subjects you have to do some blogging. Write a blog post that cites the paper. Call out some points and tell us why this paper is important. Maybe relate it to other stuff in the field that we know, or should know.<p>Take a look at an issue of <i>Nature</i>. At the front there are a lot of little articles that summarize the content and the significance of the real research papers elsewhere in the journal. Try linking to something like that, even if you have to write it yourself.

380377,story,,,87,65,patryn20,"Ask HN: Clients are gone, lots of debt, what would you do?",,"Last October I left a comfy job at a marketing startup that had become very profitable (Inc 500, NY Times articles, and all that jazz). I had stopped taking classes full time to work with this company, so I never completed my CS degree. After leaving my job, I started my own company to develop some consumer site ideas. My partner bailed early to go to law school, so there was a bit of a gray cloud overhead from the start.<p>In order to get money coming in I began running lead generation and online marketing for a few clients. Over time, that grew to consume my entire working hours. It peaked at about $70k in revenue in July and has been steadily declining from there to a low of $15k in November, thanks to the economy and increased online ad competition.<p>On Monday of this week, without warning, my last two clients pulled the plug due to economic conditions. The deals were profitable, but they had too many account defaults. One client has seen his annual bad debts total double in November. So, to free up cash flow, they cut me loose.<p>I poured my entire savings into the company and had up to $50k in credit card debt at one point. Running online campaigns and lead generation, you pay for ads up front and invoice in arrears.<p>As the company made profits, I paid myself as little as possible to cover my bills. The rest was used to pay down debt. Early on, I tried doing contract work on the side to pay my personal bills. This worked until I was stiffed on a large project. Since the business was making money by this point, I focused on it full time.<p>As it stands, the company has about $13k in credit card debts. I have an additional $17k in personal credit card debt from living off of credit before the company was profitable.<p>The corporation is getting one last $6k check. There are no finished products to show for the last year, no remaining savings, an incomplete CS degree, and $30k in debt between the company and myself. The corporation also has contracts to keep its rack space until the end of January at a cost of $600/month.<p>I just sold my old (expensive) car and got a Toyota. I am vacating my apartment and bumming with parents and friends.<p>The corporation has an internal advertising and lead management system that I am tempted to lease to customers. There was talk with some local Austin marketing guys of launching that as a product a few months back, but it never worked out. There are currently four servers sitting idle that could be put to use. There are also three consumer sites in various stages of completion.<p>If you were in this situation, what would you do? Dissolve the company, get a job, and move on? Go back to school? Launch the advertising product? Launch the consumer products while bumming around to avoid rent? A combination of the above?<p>Has anyone been in a similar situation? I am seriously stressed out and likely not thinking clearly, so I would love an outside perspective.",1227994532

Now say that, in 2007, a loaf of bread cost $1000. In that year, you had enough money to buy 1 loaf of bread. Now, in 2014, you have $600 (40% less than 2007). But now, instead of $1000, a loaf of bread is $100. Now you have enough money to buy 6 loaves of bread. You technically have less money, but the value of each dollar you have is significantly more. So, are you really &quot;poorer&quot; now?<p>The issue with just looking at a single number when analyzing economic health is that it will never tell you the whole story. I can have a million dollars and still be in poverty if a gallon of milk costs 2 million.",1418680693

Increasing transparency and generating more data when there is already a very low signal to noise ratio and an even lower impetus to act on actual signal feels like a waste of time and energy.  For example, we don&#x27;t need any more data about NSA privacy invasions or CIA torture or effective criminal wrongdoing on the part of the financial industry; we know there is willing, flagrant illegal activity, yet modern society (not just American society, mind you) is unwilling or incapable of doing anything about it.<p>So what will more data get us?

I&#x27;d like to book a flight from city A to city B on an A380. There are two possible routes on two different carriers, and I&#x27;m happy to pay the (fairly small) premium.<p>Do you have any idea how difficult it is to actually do that, to manually go and find the flight times and numbers that correspond to an A380, and then to find those in a search engine (either Kayak or the airlines&#x27;)? Especially when there&#x27;s a stopover. Both airlines have a ton of other flights on the same route, which is just noise that I have to filter through. But I&#x27;m willing to spend a couple hours doing that to book a slightly less miserable transatlantic flight.<p>If comfort information was readily available and visible on a flight search, people would actually be able to make that choice. But it&#x27;s not, so it&#x27;s not reasonable to draw the conclusion that people don&#x27;t care about it.

The state permits companies to carry out activities like banking or debt collection; in return, these companies agree to meet certain standards of behaviour: for example, only lending to people who can afford the debt, or backing their promises with a certain amount of assets.<p>This is a bizarre statement that simply isn&#x27;t true. Historically, the state has just as frequently <i>encouraged</i> lenders to lend to people who couldn&#x27;t otherwise afford what they were purchasing. This has been done through legislation like the Community Reinvestment Act, as well as government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

This is why most of our buses have switched over to serial (e.g. USB, PCIe, etc). Sometimes we run those serial busses in parallel, but that still works out to being easier.<p>Timing is another huge one. Imagine running 2 million wires (for a 1080p display) that have to all be the exact same length to within some tolerance.<p>The longer those wires gets the harder this gets. This is also another huge reason why the move to serial buses has happened. You can run 4 wires with really tight timings and the bits will fly, but if you try and run 16 wires all together, speed ends up dropping dramatically. Reality is that circuit boards don&#x27;t have room for a large number of traces running in parallel of all the exact same length!<p>RAM is a huge exception to this, but extreme measures have been taken to enable this to happen, a good chunk of your Mobo is taken up getting the RAM connected, and memory controllers moved onboard the CPU in part to get RAM closer to the CPU to simplify traces,<p>Note this is all the perspective of a software guy who has to listen to the hardware team grumble for most of the day. :)",1418679044

The old adage goes &quot;as an engineer, I have never found a code base I liked&quot;. I understand there are best practices that are really helpful. I am a huge believer in TDD, paired programming, DevOps, and other extreme programming principles. But I have never been in an organization that had the zeal that I do for these things. Every code base I have worked on (including code bases I completely wrote on my own) has needed refactoring. Some, most, on a constant basis.<p>I hate to admit, but the minority of engineers who write code correctly the first time is so low, you will not run into them very often in your career. [1] I hope you find them. Personally I have become quite happy with refactoring poor code, even when those who did not write it correctly the first time do not appreciate nor learn from my efforts.<p>As for your comment about your first job, I think you will find that there are a few engineers who have many many years of experience. However, you will find many more engineers who have one year of experience repeated over and over again. They may have 10 years on paper, but in reality they have about 1 years worth of experience. How you learn to correct them and help the organization who pays your check will be the deciding factor in your future financial success. You are at the precipice of a hugely successful career! Don&#x27;t get too stressed by poor engineering groups, because you will run into them regularly.<p>It really seems like you have made up your mind to move on.

He graduated college in the 70&#x27;s, wasn&#x27;t sure what to do, and decide to walk from New York to the Pacific ocean. This book covered the first half of the walk; he wrote it while taking a break in Louisiana along the way.<p>That book was hugely influential to me. I graduated college and spent two years teaching. The summer after my second year of teaching, I had no obligations to anyone else for the first time in my life. I remembered Peter Jenkins&#x27; story, and decided to bicycle across the US. I knew I wanted to travel under my own power as he had done, but I wanted to go a little faster than he did. Bicycling was perfect for me. I ended up doing two cross-country trips over successive summers, and then I spent a year living on my bicycle, circumnavigating North America.<p>I reread <i>A Walk Across America</i> some years after doing my own trips. I was amazed at how bad I thought the book was. pg observes that<p><i>The same book would get compiled differently at different points in your life.</i><p>This is absolutely true. Now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, I&#x27;m going to go back and reread the most influential books of my 20&#x27;s.

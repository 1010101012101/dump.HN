I had no previous Go experience (not even &quot;hello world&quot;), so it was entirely new to me. Not only did I find the language a pleasure to use, but I was supremely impressed by the standard library and its heavy support for image manipulation.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving</a>",1381669152
6542443,comment,6541721,6542335,4,0,acomar,,,"> Before you scream &quot;bullshit!&quot;, bear in mind that this research has been used by NASA to ensure that personality types that don&#x27;t mix well don&#x27;t end up as astronauts together in extremely dangerous space missions, and it also helped Bill Clinton to unseat an incumbent president in the 1992 US Presidential race.<p>In what way are either of those things evidence in support of your claims...? NASA might be interested in this research but this appeal to authority is fallacious -- NASA is an organization interested in physics and astronomy. If you told me NASA claimed someone found water on Pluto, I&#x27;d believe you. But personality tests are not that.<p>And presidential races are just so full of BS to begin with. This last cycle was proof of that. It&#x27;s basically impossible to say that anything in particular helped any given candidate in any given year, but every pundit loves to speculate anyway. So there&#x27;s plenty of theorizing to go around.<p>Nothing you posted (including in your citations) gives me any kind of predictive link between the theory you espouse and how people will actually behave.<p>To make matters worse:<p>> Everybody has a mix of some/all of the above, but one personality type dominates.<p>Makes the whole thing sound vacuous.",1381669140

Most other people see a trend only when it rises from 5%, to 10%, to 15%, etc.<p>People hear some police unit bought a tank, and think &quot;ok, but it&#x27;s not a police state&quot;. Then they see more units buying tanks and other war equipment, and they still think &quot;ok, but it&#x27;s not a police state yet&quot;. Then they see the police using the same equipment against protesters, and still say &quot;ok, but it&#x27;s still not a police state yet. America is not Russia! etc&quot;.<p>Then, they start barging into people&#x27;s home for things they&#x27;ve searched online, and for protests they &quot;liked&quot; online, and start thinking &quot;ok, maybe we <i>are</i> a police state now&quot;.<p>The problem is now it&#x27;s going to be a very hard uphill battle to roll everything back. Now only do you have the police units wanting to keep all that equipment they bought, and thinking they now <i>absolutely need it</i> to &quot;keep them safe&quot;, but you also have contracts lobbying to keep the police buying such equipment from them, and the federal government supporting it, too, and so on and so on.<p>And all of that perhaps could&#x27;ve been stopped early on 10-15 years ago, if people actually believed the people who started saying US is becoming a police state, and didn&#x27;t wait until the very last moment, until nothing can be rolled back anymore, just like with the NSA spying.<p>There are at least 2 trends that are <i>starting now</i>, that you can start fighting early, before it goes too far: domestic drone surveillance, and NSA collaboration with domestic agencies.<p>These trends are very early, and most people are still probably thinking &quot;ok, but let&#x27;s see how it goes first, before we get outraged&quot;. Sure, you can do that. But before you know it, drones will surveil everything from the sky for the government, and NSA sharing with DEA, FBI, DHS, and even the police will be done &quot;as a matter of fact&quot;.

As far as I know, there is nothing similar anywhere in Europe today.<p>If we put weight on genetics, English style slow social mobility class system would be the worst kind.<p>Some biologists have theorized that rigid class system has kept the genetic differences between classes minimal. Lowest peasants have same amount of genetic advantages and disadvantages as upper class because there was minimal mixing between them. In the modern times when class structure collapses and social mobility increases it will be different.  Successful and beautiful people move to big cities where they meet each others and mate (Finland and Nordic countries have high social mobility). New upper class will form that self selects it&#x27;s members based on  personal traits and performance. This would mean that new upper class will be more beautiful, fit and intelligent and genetic disadvantages will concentrate on lower classes. In other words, if genetics is important, giving equal opportunity to all children and high social mobility will create upper class with better genetics.<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/may/22/social-mobility-data-charts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/may/22/social-...</a>",1381668098

The first one is that the number of users of computers has increased by orders of magnitude in the past couple of decades. He looks back longingly at people doing complex stuff on Access back in the day, yet I would not be surprised if there were as many of those cases today, probably even more. Simply, their number now seems relatively much smaller. Computing is now a tool for everybody, not just for Western office men.<p>Which brings us to the second issue: for most people, computing is just a tool to solve problems that they encounter in real life. These problems have nothing to do with computing in the first place so, understandably, people tend to prefer solutions that allow them to focus on their actual problem rather than on the developer&#x27;s own problems.",1381667721

6542379,comment,6537471,6539019,7,0,tripzilch,,,"I tried doing that in Word once, it&#x27;s nowhere near the solid foundation that actual style sheets provide (thinking of CSS/HTML here).<p>I only needed to style H1, H2, P, EM and possibly A (they don&#x27;t have those names in Word, but you get the point). That&#x27;s probably the simplest document structures you can have for a task that reasonably makes use of styles.<p>The biggest problem was, those styles are like liquid, slipping between your fingers as you work with them. You do one thing to the <i>text</i> and suddenly you find yourself in a style that&#x27;s &quot;adapted&quot; from a style you&#x27;ve already defined, I think I&#x27;ve even encountered a new <i>hybrid</i> style between two of my user-defined ones. And then there&#x27;s of course the &quot;built in&quot; paragraph and heading styles, occasionally thrown into the mix as well.<p>The point is, this is not at all like an actual style sheet based way of working, such as with CSS/HTML. You could get the above result by using (bad) code such as <h2><p><em>OOPS</em></p></h2>, you&#x27;d also get a mix of three styles. But the thing is, in Word, all these new hybrid styles got added to the style sheet!<p>So get this, I wrote part of a document, decided (as long as I have to do this in Word ..) I&#x27;d use style sheets, made the styles, continued writing on the <i>document</i> and the existing <i>styles</i> changed as I moved bits of text around.<p><i>Not</i> having exactly that happen, is one of the main reasons to have a strict separation of content and style in the first place, is it not?<p>I&#x27;m sorry but, I don&#x27;t think Word actually <i>supports</i> &quot;styles&quot;. It&#x27;s got some stuff that kind of looks like styles, but once you actually try to use it, it&#x27;ll just waste your time at exactly those moments where you&#x27;d expect a proper styles system to <i>save</i> you time.<p>At some point I had finished the content and I decided to make the H2 a bit bigger font. With styles that should be the easiest thing right? Haha! Right. That&#x27;s when you get to see all the adapted styles that suddenly appeared in your H2&#x27;s markup, and they don&#x27;t change along. So instead of just changing your styles, you are going to have to edit your document content anyway.<p>The whole experience was very, very messy. In hindsight I&#x27;d have preferred to keep the &quot;style sheet&quot; in my head and apply all the markup manually, like most people do, instead of relying on the program to take care of this for me, but wasting my time instead. No wonder that&#x27;s the route most people seem to take.<p>(disclaimer: this experience was a few years ago, maybe they fixed it by now and styles are actually styles and don&#x27;t change while editing your content, and are in fact either applied to some part of the content or not, and not somewhere in between)",1381667642

6542331,comment,6538813,6538813,4,0,andor,,,"This is a movie about freedom of speech, self-censorship in media, and which people are really put at risk by publishing cables (hint: corruption and organized crime).<p>Short summary, including spoilers:<p>A group of Wikileaks-affiliated journalists tries to find media partners in the -stan countries that would publish Wikileaks cables locally. The meetings with those organizations are set up as interviews about free speech in their respective countries. As a surprise in those meetings, they are offered the cables about their own country. They film the initial reactions, try to sign a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement about how the cables should be handled, and follow up if any stories were published. It&#x27;s really interesting to see what happens. Some sign the agreement, but don&#x27;t publish anything. One guy in Kazakhstan actually says that he doesn&#x27;t want democracy. The editor of a newspaper in Turkmenistan that they speak to turns out to be a member of parliament. That newspaper has a picture of Turkmenistan&#x27;s president on it&#x27;s front page every day.<p>Then, Alan Rusbridger from The Guardian and Bill Keller from the NYT are interviewed. It&#x27;s astonishing to see that media in the US and UK have similar fears than those in the -stan countries. For example, Assange criticized that The Guardian redacted the names of a mafia boss, who according to cables had close ties with Uzbekistan&#x27;s president. They apparently did this because they fear libel lawsuits, in which the burden of proof would lie on the libeler.",1381666685

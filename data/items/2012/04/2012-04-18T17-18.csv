Managers who operate on the assumption that they're supposed to decide matters so often intervene to wreck them. It seems strange, but it's simple cognitive dissonance. It's psychologically difficult for middle managers who add no value not to interfere, because that would mean admitting that they add no value. So in order to prove they deserve their authority, they interfere and cause harm. That's not true of everybody in such positions, of course. The smarter ones understand that mostly what they need to do is nothing, just let people work - sort of like the new-age Buddhist saying, ""Don't just do something, stand there!""

3859234,comment,3850935,3857728,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>That situation has now changed, and it's inevitable that there's going to be a squeeze.</i><p>I think the problem is that the squeeze is not optimally applied. While we can cheer the idea of record labels (<i>qua</i> rent-seekers) having their margins reduced, I'm not so happy about Starving Artists being in the same situation as collateral damage. Additionally, he's observing that the labels had somewhat more utility than they were given credit for, in terms of seeking out and developing new talent. Now with youTube we're seeing Andy Warhol's prediction that 'in the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes' come true, to a large extent - the trick is to be ready to exploit the hell out of the fame when it does come by, but not everyone works this way.<p>On a more general note, the inflexibility of current copyright is IMHO part of the problem. If I'm creating content then I do want some choice over how it is distributed - because I want to be rewarded for my effort - but I would be willing to give some of this up for information about how it used. The big problem with DRM was that it got in the way of legitimate uses by genuine buyers, while attempting to prevent any unauthorized use whatsoever. Now, if I'm a musician and 10,000 people download my new mp3 single while only 10 of them pay for it, that's painful.<p>But if, instead of DRM, we had some kind of Embedded Media  Analytics, then it would help me a lot to know that 500 of the people who downloaded the song listened more than 10 times over the following month, because then I would have 500 high-quality marketing leads for my next release. The problem with the ad-based collectivization model is that you can get some aggregate data about how your media is consumed [1], but you don't get much in the way of targeted leads - the same entity that is distributing your content is inviting you to bid on ad keywords for your next campaign, and naturally they have no interest in aggregating data that comes from outside their platform, since they're selling the latform. (I don't mind to single out Google here; I'm just picking youTube as my preferred music-discovery portal. Other people like Facebook or iTunes or _____).<p>The hypocrisy within the tech industry is that we want content to be free or freely licensable, but at the same time we're obsessed with privacy and horrified at the idea that our content consumption could be object of outside scrutiny (eg DRM tracking of what we play in our headphones when we are out for a walk or what movies we like to watch when we can't sleep at 2am). I think part of that negativity is legitimate in that such information can be abused for repressive ends, but there's another part, less legitimate, that argues on the basis that it <i>will</i> be used for such ends, inevitably, and therefore any and all requests for such information are Bad. What I'd like to see is a development of Creative Commons licensing that acknowledged the idea of content consumption as a two-way street: you can legally enjoy this content for free, as long as you share some basic information about your consumption that will assist the content creator. Or you can reuse some of this content in your own project for free, up front, but any revenue that you derive from it (eg as a background track) is split with the original creator. In this world, I envision licensing being negotiated for percentages rather than expensive (and exclusionary) fixed sums that must be paid up front by the licensee, and the accounting/fulfillment taking place automatically.<p>This could work for software too. Imagine a Free Photoshop, that you can legally download and use without any technological limitations for free or some nominal fee like $20. But if you start publishing content and all your content is heavily massaged with Photoshop as part of its creation process, then 5% of your content revenue flows to Adobe. Or you could pay $500 and have unlimited use but only one upgrade. The model of 'free to use, but share your commercial revenue' has been around for a long time as an idea, but there's no product/platform that automates the revenue-sharing part of it and no legal framework providing the commercial predictability that would be needed for such an infrastructure to develop.<p>1.

It's a good thing that the system doesn't distinguish between a hundred one-share orders and a single hundred-share order; such a distinction would be totally arbitrary.  (By contrast, ranking orders by time is <i>not</i> arbitrary.  All else being equal, it's better for things to get resolved faster; the only question is whether we're giving too much of a reward for too little of an improvement.)<p>Elsewhere in this thread (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3856015"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3856015</a>) I argue against treating orders differently based on the ""entity"" that placed them.<p>In general, we want traders to spend their time thinking about asset prices and risk, not market structure and game theory.  The price-time priority system is a very simple one that rewards traders for deciding what they want and then announcing it right away.  All the modifications that have been proposed in this thread encourage traders to play games, second-guess one another, or otherwise work around the system.<p>There are definitely tradeoffs, but personally I think it's better to use the cleaner system and accept the latency arms race than to add a layer of artificial incentives -- and for what it's worth, it appears that nearly every major electronic market has come to the same conclusion.<p>Finally, thanks for the link to the Talmud article: it was a very cool application of game theory to history.

If you want to use these languages, you have a choice between (a) learning the theory, and (b) not fully understanding the tool you're using.  Both have significant downsides from a UI perspective.<p><i>Learn You A Haskell</i> is a classic case of (b).  As a tutorial it's completely successful, and how?  It tells you that you can learn Haskell without learning PL theory.  It also neglects to tell you how to <i>debug</i> you a Haskell (without learning PL theory).  But once you type in the examples, I'm sure you can figure it out.<p>A lot of people are smart enough to program on top of mysterious black boxes.  That is: a lot of people are smart enough to work past this UI problem.  Moreover, the smartest people can learn Haskell by rote and then gradually, through intuition and experience, learn to grok the black box.

Am I trading an equal amount of gold that represents the perceived valued I provided the rest of the economy? What is the real definition of the thing taking place here?

If you perform an aggregation on 10 fields in a log file, a common pattern, you are going to be generating more intermediate data than your log files during the shuffle. (Hadoop is, in this case.) If you generate a dataset that has pairwise scores for users, even if you are only sampling 1% of them than you are generating <i>way</i> more data than your input. (You are generating this data in this example, not Hadoop, which is why I included it.) Say N=1M. You want to compute the top 1% pairwise scores (pruned via some locality sensitive hashing.) Guess what, you are computing N^2 * 0.01 = 10B records. Perfectly tractable for a big data system. You seem too busy yelling at me to even read what I am writing, since I stated this clearly: ""(I realize in practice you generally do not compute the entire space because it will be too slow.

Ie, they should not be using EMR, and he is so clever for realizing the folly of their ways. My claim is the author does not understand the purpose of EMR. By definition, EMR brings with it the benefits of EC2. I don't see how this is a strawman.<p>At least I am sure now that it's not my communication skills, I illustrated two perfectly fine examples and you glossed right over them without understanding.

One abstraction's metadata is another's ""data data"".<p>For example, there was a structured store where each entity was a byte array (""blob"") with certain searchable, indexed ""metadata"". (The ""data data"" was the blob itself.) However, demands on the structure required certain additional fields regarding the content of that ""metadata"" that were allowed to break the contract of the original ""metadata"" and were therefore metadata on the metadata.<p>I fell out of my chair, hoping the ""kick"" would bring me up a level.

As far as monetization worries, a cool tool of this kind is just as much a sound business model as any site fueled by display ads. Here's why in my opinion...at this stage in the development of the consumer web every product's success is a function of its ability to capture the waking hours of the consumers' disposable leisure time (this isn't the 90s when every web site was supposed to have the same business model as the new york times). Consider this assumption. Musicians spend a lot of time playing music alone and with each other, possibly more than instagramers spend taking pictures. Ultimately, especially if the bull market for venture backed companies continues, someone will create a way to capture these disposable leisure hours from the wide user base of musicians. but @pud it would be a lot easier with half a million users...<p>@replax
Mic Quality Problem
a) A fair point, but its worth considering the fact that most musicians would cede a high quality mic for the ability to interact with one another. Also, lets not forget that the barriers to entry for a powerful microphone have come down considerably in the last ten years. Today, a Blue Snowball (<$100 used maybe new) will compete with microphones that were well above its price range ten years ago.<p>Also check out the iRig.

It's really ""the success story"", as it's the top downloaded free game (except for XBox Live Extras).<p>I wonder what the revenue numbers for the top free iPhone and Android games are? Tapitude looks like it's doing about $3,000 a week / $400-500 a day. (Am I reading their chart right?) Didn't we hear plenty of stories about how Draw Something was doing $100,000 a day (now that's probably combining ad revenue and in-app purchases from the free version plus the sales of the paid version).<p>I'm not saying that there isn't money to be made on Windows Phone, but if the top free game is only doing $400 / day, it's orders of magnitude less than on iOS. Is it worth it to have your app in the ""smaller pond"" of a less-crowded app store? Maybe.<p>I suspect their huge spike over the past 2-3 weeks is due to the Lumia 900 - everyone trying out some new apps on their new phone.

If the man sticks money under the mattress, he reduces inflation (slightly) and increases the buying power of the rest of the world.<p>Because the money under the mattress doesn't produce a good or service.  The maid does.  By spending money you increase the number of goods and services available to the world.  That's the way our economy tends to work.  You spend money to get goods and services, which encourages the production of goods and services.  Money in motion leads to more stuff.  Money not in motion means people are sitting idle, not producing the goods and services they otherwise would.  Whatever good the money under the mattress does for the inflation rate, it's more than counterbalanced by the fact that the world has less stuff to spend its money on.",1334768835

And what is wrong with welding?<p>What is it about programming that requires dedication beyond regular and predictable work hours? If the implication is that the 501'ers aren't thinking about what they do when they are not at work --they say they ""...value personal creative projects over commercial products the world doesn't need."" Certainly that is an abrasive way to phrase it, but it's clear that they are doing some level of development outside of their workday. This could cover keeping abreast of the state-of-the-art, certainly I feel that it is my responsibility to keep my skills competitive and up-to-date.<p>You yourself prefer regular and predictable work hours, why shouldn't your software developers be able to enjoy these kinds of hours as well? The implication seems to be that people who work these kinds of schedules will be unwilling to work longer during a ""crunch period."" I don't see any reason to believe this is the case; I strive to work regular and predictable hours and I will put in extra time when warranted. I take full responsibility for my work and its effect on the company. I don't know what more any manager could ask of their employee and it's not clear where the 501'er is (in your estimation) falling short.<p>Perhaps you believe that someone who strives for a regular and predictable schedule will be spending all of their time eyeballing the clock, perhaps even ""gaming the system"" to work as little as possible. For sure, such people exist, but I don't believe that there is any reason to assume a 501'er is one of these people. Again, I have to point out that you enjoy this kind of schedule yourself and you are clearly not spending all day ""watching the clock."" For that very reason, I find your objection to hiring a 501'er very puzzling.<p>Lastly, as an aside, I wonder if the objection to the 501'er Manifesto boils down to this: the 501'er clearly values their personal life over their professional life. It seems to me much more difficult for a manager or business owner to baldly argue that their employees should value their work product more than their girlfriends, wives or families. Yet I can't help wondering if that isn't their true objection; that despite what they may say or do they are very much looking for people who are willing to live very unbalanced lives, lives that are unbalanced in favor of the workplace.",1334768586

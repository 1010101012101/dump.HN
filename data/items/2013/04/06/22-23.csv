I started off slow, but even now I can really get into it.<p>I look forward to going to the gym and getting a work-out in when I get home from work. I used to absolutely hate it, because people told me that I should do cardio to lose weight ... now most of what I do is lifting. A little cardio and the inches keep coming off, and I keep getting stronger.<p>Find something you enjoy doing (I love swimming) and find pleasure in doing that, even if it is for a short period of time per day. Running clearly isn't for you, and it isn't for me...",1365289189

Thanks for the upvotes.<p>Some comments to the project: I built it, because i found myself using/implementing pubsubhubbub in another project of mine and realized I would like to subscribe to all possible feeds.

5505369,comment,5504051,5505328,1,0,farslan,,,"OP here. SPF13 itself is really nice. But the main difference here is first I try to emulate ST2, second I'm really picky which plugins are integrated. I also don't use vundle (because It should always have the same feature regardless of the state of plugin), instead of I'm using pathogen (which I like more). With time I will update the plugins myself, but only if they have bugfixes or features that are necessary to be added.<p>Some of plugins (like ctrlp) is modified in order to use the ctags binary I'm bundling and installing. There is also pre-compiled version of YCM in subvim. Together it means autocompletion and goto features are really working. You really don't install anything.<p>The plugins settings are modified in order to emulate ST2 like behavior, like accepting autocomplete entry via enter, creating a newline after braces,quotes,etc.., opening a new tabs whenever you call cmd+p (but not if you call cmd+r for using goto), closing the application and starting again brings all you tabs/files again and so on..<p>They are many things I'm trying to improve, like adding snippet system, more improved installation procedure, multiplatform support (linux and windows). SPF13 is much better on these terms.<p>I hope with time it will get better :)",1365289020

Lift heavy as possible - you'll have a difficult time stimulating lots of muscle growth with light weights which I've personally tried.<p>2.  Use proper form - tons of people get injured on heavy resistance exercises because of improper form or lifting too much without a spotter.<p>3.  Go to muscular failure - the final rep where you can't lift the weight no more is the most important.  It contributes the most to kick starting your muscle growth mechanism.<p>4.  Don't overtrain - you need to give your body ample rest and recovery for your muscles to grow the most.  (Personally I'm training once every 3 days and currently this is working well for me).<p>5.  Train the full body - building stronger/bigger legs will help build mass everywhere in your body.  Don't think you're get strong just doing push-ups.  You need to work all the major muscles in some way - quads, hamstring, glutes, calves, pecs, lats, delts, triceps, biceps, etc.<p>6.  You only need to spend 25 minutes 2-3 times a week.  Tip: look into High Intensity Training principles from Arthur Jones, Mentzer, Darden and others.  They promoted short, intense workouts (usually one set to failure per exercise) that stimulated arguably more muscle growth than longer workouts.",1365287933

It's a mindset. You either have it or you don't. I think most people can understand this, so then ""Hacker School"" would imply that it's a school for hackers. This is somewhat confirmed by their about page:<p>> You should genuinely enjoy programming. That's most important. We spend our time talking about technical problems and writing code, not working on startups and products. If you care more about startups than coding, you won't enjoy Hacker School. We look for curiosity, passion, raw intelligence and a desire to build things. The best way to show us this is to have a track record of writing code and learning new things. If you're a smart, curious person who loves coding, it will come out naturally. Don't try to trick us. It probably won't work and it won't get you what you want anyway.<p>Sounds like a description of a hacker to me. But then I get confused about why ""Hacker School"" was chosen. You go to ""Law School"" to learn about law, to become a lawyer, not because you already are one and just want to improve. You go to (a good) ""Game School"" to learn to build video games, not because you already build video games.<p>So I guess in summary: ""Hacker School"" seems inappropriately named. Perhaps ""Hacker Bootcamp"" would be more fitting, given the goals of the school, or even ""School for Hackers""?

This is a common trick of the French police: when people are held in custody, they have the right to an attorney and to keep silent, which the police don't like. So the police question ""free"" people and threaten them to hold them in custody if they don't cooperate obediently. Most people (especially good citizens) are scared of being held in custody, so the trick works quite well: people answer every single question and have no attorney, despite their right (and interest) to do otherwise.<p>In the present case, the charges (had any been pressed  he was there as a free person) would have been akin to terrorism, which means that the custody would have been under anti-terrorism rules: a very unpleasant experience that can last up to 96 hours. So the pressure was very high, despite his being ""free"".",1365286588

5505252,comment,5504129,5504580,8,0,dave1619,,,"A word of caution... StrongLifts and Starting Strength promote advanced compound motions (ie., deadlift, bench press, squat, etc).  So, it's great to kick start your muscle growth mechanism and gain strength.  It's hard to argue against the deadlift, squat and bench press.  But personally I've found that these exercises can be difficult and you need instruction.  For the bench press you want to arch your back and bring your shoulder blades together to give support as you press so you don't injure your shoulder and/or rotator cuff.  The squat and deadlift also aren't simple exercises.  Lots of people get injured doing these advanced exercises.<p>I'd highly recommend watching a bunch of videos on correct form (ie., Starting Strength has a decent dvd and YouTube has some decent tutorials).  But even better would be to get a very good personal trainer to teach you these lifts.<p>I'm just really hesitant suggesting a beginner to go out to the gym and try these moves on their own.  Sounds like a recipe for disaster.<p>My other criticism of StrongLifts and Starting Strength is because of the complexity of the movements, the higher in weight you go the more you really should have a spotter and that just makes working out that much more complicated (need to arrange a time to meet someone, etc).  If you don't use a spotter and you've progressed to some really heavy weights then it can be dangerous.  There's quite of few deaths from the bench press every year.<p>Personally, rather than pushing myself alone a barbell squat what I'll do is I'll pre-exhaust myself with a few sets of barbell squats (moderate weight) and then go to exhaustion on the leg extension, leg press and leg curl machines.  This to me is a much safer route then trying to max out on a barbell squat.<p>For deadlift, I do a modified stiff-leg deadlift (I learned this by watching Dorian Yates) where I start from a standing position and don't go down all the way.  I also use moderate weights for this.<p>For bench press, I had to learn correct form (after hurting my shoulder a bit thinking I knew how to bench).  I go max weight on this but I use one of those assisted power racks for safety.<p>To me the lifts that Starting Strength and Stronglifts promote are too important to ignore but I just don't agree with their program for everyone.  For beginners working out by themselves in the gym and wanting to do the deadlift, squat and bench press... I suggest:<p>1.  Learn proper form on these advanced movements from an expert.<p>2.  Go moderate weight on deadlift and barbell squats if you're working out by yourself.<p>3.  Don't be stupid on the bench press by lifting your max without a spotter.  I read that more deaths happen because of the bench press than any other exercise in the gym.<p>For beginners, I would probably not suggest not StartingStrength/StrongLifts.  But rather, I'd suggest working out 2-3 times a week (average 20-30 minutes per workout) using High Intensity Training principles and techniques.  The basic principles is doing one set to muscular failure per exercise.<p>If you're really just starting out, read Body By Science (Little and McGuff) and follow their Big Five exercise program.  It's the top 5 exercises (machines) that you do once a week.  Just one set each to failure and it only takes 20 minutes/week.  The key is going to failure.<p>If you're wanting more, check out The New High Intensity Training (Darden).  He summarizes the basics of H.I.T and gives some decent workouts.  He suggests 3 times a week for beginners and the workouts take less than 30 minutes each.  Again the key is going to failure with each exercise.",1365286553

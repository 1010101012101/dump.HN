Every single other company is coming out with its own &quot;App Store&quot; - few are exclusive at this point, but the tide might turn that way (already I believe Microsoft and Apple have taken steps that have made it more difficult for Steam).<p>That said, OpenGL is an increasingly relevant player due to WebGL, mobile devices, Apple&#x27;s growing market share, etc.  It is also possible to simultaneously target OpenGL and DirectX with things like ANGLE.  If your game is written in OpenGL, it is relatively easy to port to different operating systems, assuming you don&#x27;t rely heavily on platform-specific libraries (and if you already support Mac, it is typically even easier to port to other *nix-based platforms).  If the XBox One is OGL capable (via its Windows layer), porting could get even easier.<p>To top it off, I&#x27;m pretty sure it will get support from at least of the few big engines: ID Tech, Unreal, Unity, and CryEngine all seem to be potential candidates.  90+ percent of games use one of these engines.",1379966047
6433712,comment,6432306,6432494,2,0,kllrnohj,,,"Input latency is going to be <1ms. The payload is tiny and will fit in a single packet, and if your LAN&#x27;s latency is more than 1ms your LAN is bad and you should feel bad.<p>Audio & Video, on the other hand, is more interesting. Let&#x27;s assume everything is running at 60fps. Your encoder is therefore not adding any more than 16ms (if it was more, it wouldn&#x27;t be keeping up and therefore not doing 60fps - it could definitely be less, though). Blu-ray is 48mbit/s, but for 24fps (youtube &#x27;s 1080p is ~8mbit for comparison). Let&#x27;s take that same 48mbit/s, but adjust for 60fps instead. 1 frame would therefore be 0.8 mbit, or 100KB. If your network can do 48mbit/s, your video latency would therefore be 16ms. If your network is faster, though, the latency drops proportionally. Even a cell phone can do 100mbit/s on wifi, which would be 8ms of latency. A gigabit network would transfer that 0.8mbit needed in about a millisecond.<p>So your total latency of input, encoding, and transmission of the frame would be 32ms at most, and if you have a fast network & computer it could actually be down in the 5ms or less range.",1379966035

If you do it naively you encode frame-per-frame (encoding slices is more difficult), and the encoder does not only outputs iframes: you get partial frames that depend on both previous and <i>future</i> frames. Also the decoder does not always output frames in order. So you have to expect something around ~10 frames of latency, maybe less if you optimize everything well enough. That still means easily more than 100ms of lag.<p>The network is really not the main issue here.",1379965827

A more reasonable argument is that  the hypothetical existence of 10x engineers explains little about the productivity of most organizations.<p>Personally, in the couple decades I have been in this business working in countless companies in Silicon Valley, I have met a few individuals that I think could be accurately characterized as 10x engineers. An important point is that they are not productive at just one type of development but genuine computer science and software engineering polymaths. They are incredibly rare but they do exist for all practical purposes. People that are 10x engineers never seem to think of themselves that way, it is how the other engineers think of them. It advertises itself; if you have to tell people you are a 10x engineer, &quot;ninja&quot;, &quot;rockstar&quot;, etc then you probably are not.<p>I will add that none of the 10x engineers I worked with were burning the candle at both ends. They did not work particularly hard compared to everyone else, they were just extraordinarily effective and consistent at making excellent choices in an engineering context <i>and</i> always worked very well with most engineering teams they needed to work with. I&#x27;ve never seen any of these guys burn out, they&#x27;ve been doing it for decades.<p>I would also suggest that it takes quite a few years of diversified experience before you can be a legit 10x engineer.

Aren&#x27;t you in public <i>by definition</i> in places where you have no privacy? If so, then being in public is defined by how we define privacy.<p>The public/private distinction has never been absolute, such that everything about you and what you&#x27;re doing is either in public or in private at any given time. We&#x27;re sharing our thoughts on a public forum on the Internet, but at least one of us is physically sitting in his own home while doing so. I have different expectations of privacy for what I&#x27;m saying on HN vs. the conversation I just had with someone in this room.<p>The lines are similarly blurred if we go out. For example, in most jurisdictions you do not give up all rights to privacy just because you went out your front door. If a guy follows you around with a video camera and tries to watch you enter security details when you&#x27;re paying for stuff at a shop, he&#x27;s probably going to get in trouble. If a public venue installs video cameras in its bathrooms or changing rooms, it&#x27;s probably going to get in trouble. If some pervert tries to film up your or your wife&#x27;s/sister&#x27;s/daughter&#x27;s skirt, he&#x27;s probably going to get in a lot of trouble. These things are all easily possible with technology, and all happen in a &quot;public place&quot;, yet I think almost everyone would still consider them unacceptable invasions of privacy and the law in many places would prohibit such behaviour.<p>Maybe as technology that can be used for surveillance and data mining evolves, we need to evolve our understanding of what should be considered private as well, in order to maintain effective protection of the same underlying values. If metadata alone can now be used to determine sensitive details about us that we would consider to be private if collected directly, then perhaps the collection and use of that metadata should be controlled in the same ways as direct collection and use of the implicit data. If sensitive data is collected for one purpose with consent but can now be repurposed more easily for additional uses, maybe there need to be explicit safeguards to control that risk.",1379964701

For the past couple years, this has been most of my (non-billable) role at Matasano, and we&#x27;ve gotten steadily better at this stuff. So, my thoughts:<p>  <i>Spend more time</i><p>  <i>Have a mission</i><p>  <i>Always be recruiting</i><p>These three are of a kind for me.<p>I recommend that you think about hiring the way Patrick McKenzie things about conversion optimization: as a form of marketing that is amenable to engineering. In particular: start tracking it as soon as you possibly can, so you&#x27;ll have data to pull trends out of. Every effective hiring organization I&#x27;ve talked to has a process for this.<p>&quot;Have a mission&quot; sounds fuzzy but I don&#x27;t think that it is. What we&#x27;ve learned is to think a lot about what&#x27;s good for the candidate about the roles we hire for. We&#x27;ve gotten good enough at this that people on our team can write snappy job descriptions for us: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5640441"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5640441</a> --- Sean&#x27;s a good writer, which helps, but there&#x27;s also a notion across the team of what we think is great about the work. Having this &quot;through line&quot; for all your recruiting conversations makes it easier not just to sell the job to candidates but also, like any serious sales effort, to qualify prospects.<p>Being serious about qualifying also gives you another piece of data to track: how well your qualifiers predict how far people get into the funnel. That&#x27;s been helpful for us too.<p>  <i>Don&#x27;t hire</i><p>  <i>Get your hands dirty</i><p>This times 1000; I think this is the most important piece of advice he has. Jason Fried has been talking about this for years with &quot;The Importance of Hiring Late&quot;; the 37signals motto was &quot;don&#x27;t hire until you&#x27;ve done the job yourself&quot;.<p>  <i>Focus on the right way to source candidates</i><p>I agree in general with the idea here.<p>I think in particular that &quot;blind&quot; job ads of any sort do poorly. Every venue for ads that has significant visibility is both oversold and also low signal/noise ratio. We don&#x27;t take job ads seriously anymore.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to think about w/r/t poaching employees, particularly from peers. It&#x27;s important to remember that the ethics of poaching from another company have to be weighed against the best interests of candidates; refusing to talk to someone because they work for a friend&#x27;s company is probably a fraught decision. On the other hand, remember that you&#x27;re likely to be at a different company in 2 years, and your long-term relationships with people are important; I wouldn&#x27;t use inside information I have from peers to poach employees.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t work with a recruiter. They also irritate candidates and set up weird incentives.<p>  <i>Don&#x27;t compromise</i><p>  <i>Look for red flags</i><p>This is some of the oldest hiring advice in the industry, for a reason.<p>Be careful with the &quot;default-to-no&quot; posture if your hiring signals come from employee-driven interviews. Your whole team is rarely on the same exact page about what you&#x27;re hiring for.<p>I take specific issue with the &quot;red flag&quot; of people being title-conscious, because there are good reasons some people think about titles: they are (sensibly) concerned about their own career trajectory. The absolute cheapest benefit you can offer an employee is their title, and if they have a rational reason for wanting a better title, why on earth would you refuse to give up some title to get a good candidate on board?<p>  <i>Have a set of cultural values you hire for</i><p>This scares me because I think people don&#x27;t have a good idea of what a &quot;cultural value&quot; really is, or have aspirational cultural values, like &quot;we&#x27;ll work as hard as it takes to make our milestones!&quot;.<p>You discover real cultural values bottom-up, by observing what is good and effective about your team. You don&#x27;t have the value until you&#x27;ve established it in your existing team.<p>It&#x27;s obviously important that you build your team out of people who will work well with your team. But it&#x27;s equally important not to cast too small a net. Among other reasons: it can make you especially susceptible to drama, in a monocultural kind of way.<p>  <i>Hire people you like</i><p>Don&#x27;t try to do this.<p>You will be surprised by what you end up liking about people who didn&#x27;t seem like an immediate &quot;hang out on weekends&quot; fit with your social culture.<p>When you hire, try to make sure you&#x27;re hiring on objectively important criteria. Don&#x27;t kid yourself about how much it matters that a candidate wants to go bar hopping with you after work.<p>  <i>Fire fast</i><p>This is so hard to do. If you haven&#x27;t actually run a &quot;fire-fast&quot; culture at size yet, I recommend you not assume you&#x27;ll have this capability. Hire as if it&#x27;s the life-or-death decision it probably is.<p>  <i>Put a little bit of rigor around the hiring process.</i><p>Put a <i>lot</i> of rigor around the hiring process.<p>We&#x27;ve steadily standardized every part of our recruiting process and to date we&#x27;ve never looked back at something we standardized or measured and said &quot;you know, this wasn&#x27;t worth the effort or the cost in flexibility&quot;.<p>We have a funnel with specific objectives at each stage of the funnel. For instance, in 2013, I think it&#x27;s impossible to interview with us without knowing what our whole hiring process is, and without having the phone number of a company principal to call with questions. It is remarkable how often we hear how much better our process is than the typical company&#x27;s process, because the things that make us outwardly easier to talk to are so easy. And yet, until a couple years ago, we weren&#x27;t doing them either.<p>  <i>Have people audition for roles instead of interviewing for them.</i><p>There&#x27;s nothing I can say about this that hasn&#x27;t already been said a million times, but I&#x27;ll make the simplest point against it that I can: the best candidates generally aren&#x27;t available to &quot;audition&quot; for you, because they&#x27;re already working full time jobs.",1379963848

Which means the market does not have confidence in it in the first place and probably has negative momentum. Most cases I have seen the market is correct. So even if the stock is bought back the increase in the price will be temporary as the negative momentum will surely vaporize the stock increase. It does not help anybody but investors trying to make a profit in the short term. I have not seen a single stock buyback work. I would rather they throw money at anything but this.",1379963165

I know that I undervalue the importance of money in my own life (I have been poor to the point of homelessness once, poor the point of selling possessions to get rent/food money a few times). I also undervalue my worth, almost never charging an appropriate amount for my time.<p>I&#x27;ve cultivated a niche expertise that I translate well to a wide range of communities, but when asked politely I tend to give my time and even tangible goods away for free.<p>Now, I&#x27;m actively trying to change that. I&#x27;m getting married next year and am very excited to have a family in the relatively near future, so I&#x27;m paying off debts, I re-entered the workforce at a decent salary, and have been trying to train myself to be comfortable asking people for money in exchange for my time & expertise.<p>It has been harder than you might imagine, but I&#x27;m making progress. Being able to externalize the need to earn money via the idea of a future family has helped me, but I remain very uncomfortable asking and often find myself under-reporting hours spent, transportation costs, etc.<p>If I could just produce content, conduct research, give workshops & lectures & have someone else handle the money, I would be in heaven, but the few people I&#x27;ve spoken to about it, despite initial enthusiasm, have never followed through.

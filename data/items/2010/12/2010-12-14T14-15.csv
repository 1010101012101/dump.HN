Apple launched the iPhone back in 2007 and took it slow, learning from their mistakes, to build the iPad in 2010. Its a very different user experience, despite being a glorified giant iPhone, it really is a completely different use case. When carriers and hardware people get involved, unfortunately when we're talking about Windows devices, things get notoriously nerfed. Sure, you get every feature known to man in a tablet, but the battery lasts an hour or two and the build quality is terrible. As a colleague put it, it lacks ""sex and sizzle"". They need to get this right the first time, or at least mostly right, much like they did with the Xbox.",1292338609

2004330,comment,2003886,2003886,0,0,mattlong,,,"I worked at their HQ in Redwood City briefly right out of college as an entry level programmer. The campus was very nice with a wonderful fitness center that I used regularly. They also had a pretty good offering of cafeterias. It was my impression that most of the employees were relaxed and never really stressed or over-worked. Pretty much everyone worked no more than 40 hours/week. So in terms of ""work-life balance"" or whatever it's called, I'd rate it pretty high.<p>Turning to the technical side, I quickly found myself feeling very under-challenged/inspired. The tasks I was assigned were mainly fixing bugs in a huge code base (granted this is probably expected and a decent way to get new hires up to speed on the project). They weren't very involved bugs and never took more than a day or two to correct. So I was constantly asking for more tasks to work on. Frankly, I got bored. I realized the environment wasn't for me. Having come from a very rigorous undergrad program, the difference was like night and day. So I found a startup to work for (something I always knew I wanted to do at some point) and tendered my resignation 10 weeks after starting.<p>However, I got the impression that each division/group/project at Oracle have fairly different cultures. Perhaps I would have had a different/better experience had I been on a different project. Though for what it's worth, a friend of mine who graduated a year later from the same school had the exact same experience at Oracle as I had.",1292338532

Firstly, prototyping is a breeze: write your algorithms, add long-term storage if you want, spend a few minutes adding a user interface for testing, and that's it, it just works. Plus, for free, the compiler guarantees plenty of security properties, so if you're happy with what the features you have, you may not even have to think about security. Now, for performance reasons, you may want to lose some ""tier-less-ness"" by nailing some of the code onto the client or the server. That's just the matter of a few annotations. Add these annotations and yes, your application keeps working. Iterate until you're happy with the speed.<p>And then, there are a number of other things that are not specifically ""tier-less"" but that we're essentially the only ones to have. We have very high-level database primitives, concurrency primitives, distribution primitives, cache APIs, but also higher-level user-interface manipulation, etc.<p>Now, where OPA doesn't really help you is when you have to interact with down-and-dirty stuff, e.g. some third-party APIs for which we have no bindings in the standard library. For these things, you still need to handle the nitty-gritty details the old-fashioned way.<p>Still, OPA has become my favorite language, so I guess that's a good sign:)",1292337635

It's now $90/bbl.  That's huge.  And I'm still bullish.  I still think it's underpriced.  Why?  Because, while we'll never run out of oil, it will get much more expensive to get what's left.  The price of extraction after a certain point in a reserve (around half-way) goes dramatically up; the technology we've invented in the last decades has increased our ability to get to pockets of the cheap/easy-to-get-to reserves; and no large reserves of (cheap/easy-to-extract) oil has been found since the 1970's.<p>I'm surprised at the confidence in this thread, but humans have a terrible capacity for forseeing change.  Taleb's Black Swan is about this.  He has a great example: every day of a turkey's life is a reinforcement that the farmer feeds and cares for it, until the last day.  For the turkey, it's a black swan; for the farmer, it's not.  Whatever you think of the future of the price of oil, above all don't be too confident.  Don't be a turkey.",1292336457

There is no <i>necessary</i> requirement that produce -- in this context copies -- be controlled.<p>Consider the basic logic/physics of abstract goods. There is no necessary dependence of production on subsequent copies. In fact it is the opposite: the copies depend on production. It is perfectly conceivable that things be produced -- and the producers paid for that -- without any restriction of copies.<p>And this is clear in practice. Take an architect for example. They are commissioned and then design a building: they have done intellectual work and been paid for it, and so 'reaped the benefits' of their creativity to survive. Yet there has been no need for restriction on copies of their designs.<p>> The point of IP is that it's the produce of someone's mind, . . . If you copy it without permission . . . you're undermining somebody's ability to benefit from their creativity<p>But as explained above, this is not essential: it is only true for a particular, contingent, commercial arrangement.<p>You see that production is good, and also that copies are good too. What I ask is that you see that there is no essential need that one should restrict the other. And since both do us good, surely we would want to do both. What we want 
is a system that supports people to produce <i>and</i> allows freedom of copying.<p>This is why the pragmatic argument is the only plausible one. If we don't need, for practical reasons, to restrict copies, why would we? How can it be moral? What good does it do us? The idea that people have some intrinsic right to interfere with others, based merely on creatorship, is nonsensical and utterly self-destructive.<p>Just compare the limit cases (and since it is already established there is no necessary dependence of production on copies, we can look just at the copying aspect). Either: with free copying/sharing, we all greatly magnify our access to good stuff, at no cost to anyone. In a group of 100, if each of us makes some music, everyone has 100 pieces of music to listen to. Or: with absolutist IP, we all keep our own stuff (our own 'property') to ourselves, and so we all have much less stuff available to us. If each of us makes some music, everyone has only one piece of music to listen to. -- And what could be the justification there? that we '<i>know</i> without doubt' we are doing the <i>right</i> thing? -- Which community to join is an easy choice.<p>It is not possible to say a priori what particular structures of organisation or commerce are efficient. But it is possible to say the moral essentials mean we should prefer free-sharing rather than copy-restricting.",1292336399

I was mostly speaking from personal experience of winter losses; it's really heartbreaking.<p>Commercial hives are indeed relatively mobile, as they're temporarily stored on trucks to move from field to field.  It's possible that it's simply untenable to keep bees indoors on a large scale.  Hives that are too close together for long periods of time will attack and raid each other.  There simply might not be enclosed spaces large or affordable enough to hold wintering bees.<p>But someone who does commercial bee-keeping could probably give you a much better answer.",1292335278

Answer: Very.<p>(MD5: 128 bit | SHA256: 256 bit) ::
(2^256/2^128 = 2^128) => 3.40282367*10^38 of a larger keyspace.<p>I know nothing about the specifical implementation details of either hashing method (and I eagerly await tptacek to offer a far more comprehensive response) but I'm sure the difference in keyspace alone is enough to make this practically impossible.",1292335238

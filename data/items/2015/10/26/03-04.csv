I&#x27;m going to give it one more attempt, if this attempt also fails in your eyes then we&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree, okay?<p>> (1) The claim of mine, that you are disputing, is that philosophy is not nearly as relevant to science now as it was in science&#x27;s beginnings.<p>That&#x27;s an odd sentence construction. It could mean either that this is the claim from my point of view I _think_ I am disputing (and it&#x27;s not) or that this is the claim I _ought to_ be disputing (and I&#x27;m not).<p>Witness. A previous stating of the claim by you.<p>> (2) Quite the contrary - I am giving an example that is supportive of the view that, while philosophy was instrumental in the development of the scientific method, it is no longer playing that role, and has not for some time.<p>(By the way. You make claims about philosophy yet use examples from philosophy _of science_ (Popper and Kuhn). If you mean to say `philosophy of science&#x27; please say philosophy of science and do not use philosophy as a shorthand. Also, you seem to be using science and `the scientific method&#x27; interchangeably. Please don&#x27;t.)<p>You&#x27;ll see your claims don&#x27;t square.

As it stands, you have now made three successive posts without putting up an actual argument in support of your position.<p>No I do not. I stated it as a conditional (If Kuhn is right [...] could [...] would [...]) to allow for the position that someone may disagree with Kuhn specifically but it does not invalidate my point in general _if Kuhn is right_. If you keep claiming that I am not addressing the substance of your argument then I am going to have to conclude that you are arguing in bad faith. Hence, one more attempt, okay?<p>> Furthermore, you would have to show a significance comparable to the achievements of science as a whole - if your claim is that the current contributions of philosophy to science are comparable in significance to an individual hypothesis or theory, then I rest my case.<p>I do not have to show any such thing. And I am making no such claim. I am countering your claim, not attempting to make a novel claim of my own.",1445829919

Arduino is godsent for this, especially Uno-sized ones. They&#x27;re not so big to be intimidating, not small enough to make you worry you break something, and the software ecosystem around it lets you teach someone loops and conditionals while going from blinking LED to driving a robot around.<p>Shields are also cool as a concept, but I used to avoid them because they could often be as expensive as the board itself. I&#x27;m reconsidering now, given how the prices have fallen in the last year or two. Hell, my friend who is super-skilled in electronics started to buy lots of Arduino Ethernets to wire up some sensors in a small factory, because nowadays getting even a few dozens of them is cheaper than bothering with designing and making your own custom board for the task (if you add up the time you spend on designing and debugging).<p>> <i>It allowed me to make this[1]</i><p>I remember that from Show HN some time ago, I&#x27;m happy you finished it :).",1445828699

Yes that means &quot;climbing over others&quot;, and of course, it&#x27;s rather likely that you are not in fact the best.<p>The alternative is, put kindly, nepotism, put badly Machiavellian political games. You climb up by marrying the spoiled brat daughter of some senior exec and keeping her happy.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in the middle east, where nearly all companies are government controlled (not &quot;directly&quot; but through family ties) and the whole society falls into the &quot;non-toxic&quot; category according to this article. Nobody will be working 1 minute longer than they strictly have to (except the personal servants - God help those guys). There is absolutely nothing whatsoever you can do to advance (other than the spoiled brat marrying thing). Everyone who doesn&#x27;t report to you is against you in every social relation you have and people are constantly laying traps for each other, just to gain a leg up in meetings where the higher ups are present. Truly simple projects get denied necessary firewall access just so the security boss could tell your manager that you&#x27;re over time. You learn to avoid HR and only ever ask them to &quot;make a contract for THIS guy&quot;, because if you ask them to find someone only family members will be allowed to interview. Things like that.<p>Given the choices, I think I&#x27;ll be taking the &quot;TOXIC&quot; company, thank you. A lot of people tell me I&#x27;ll change my mind when I turn 50 or so (used to be 40 but that&#x27;s getting close and (I like to think) I&#x27;m still very sure I want to be in the competitive environment.",1445828520

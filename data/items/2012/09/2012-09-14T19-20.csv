He spent a summer living 28-hour days: six 28-hour days per normal week, going in and out of phase with the sun once a week.  So he needed a way to remember when to go to sleep, when to wake up, when to eat dinner, and so on.  When it's 25:00, what do you do?  We have a lifetime of intuition built up around clock times on a 24-hour clock.<p>So he wrote a digital clock that used standard-length seconds, but 70 of them per minute, 60 of those minutes per hour, and 24 of those hours per day.  So when it was 10:30:59 by his nonstandard clock, he was at the phase of his nonstandard day that corresponds to 10:30 or so of the standard day --- but the clock would then roll over to 10:30:60, 10:30:61, ... 10:30:69, 10:31:00.<p>It was very amusing to see people's reactions upon watching the clock for a little while, especially at the time of week that it was more or less in phase with normal time.",1347652352

Their website says:<p><i>In the device recognition space, for example, we believe that we have uncovered a billion dollar market  And it fits our straightforward development model. Look at many ideas. Pick an outstanding one. Patent it. Commercialize it. Reap the rewards.</i><p>Either they were really careful with the patent application phrasing, or the PTO flubbed this one.<p>THE PATENT IN QUESTION: I'm reading the actual patent and seeing that it's about a license system which is in 3 parts: device, ""portable license medium"", and registration authority (presumably a remote server).<p><a href=""http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,857,067.PN.&OS=PN/6,857,067&RS=PN/6,857,067"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sec...</a><p>MAIN IDEA: The primary claim is that the device checks the data on/from the license medium and compares it with verification data from the registration authority. The data may be a hash of the license data; it may be encrypted by a private-public key system; it may contain hardware identifiers so that the authority can check if the hardware is on an authorized list; it may be updated with new data from the authority; it may be limited by an expiry date; so on and so forth.<p>It goes on to talk about securing the licensing medium and data by means of a double verification process (through a ""license manager"").<p>LICENSING MEDIUM: The definition of the licensing medium:<p><i>The licensing medium 120 is a portable component that contains information concerning the software or other licensed electronic data that the user is authorized to access. When a user seeks to access a vended piece of electronic data, the client program communicates with the licensing medium 120 to verify that the user is authorized to access the electronic data.<p>In general, the licensing medium 120 may be any type of portable electronic data storage medium that has a unique, unalterable serial number or other form of identification that can be transmitted electronically. Examples include smart cards, memory sticks, magnetic strip cards, floppy disks and other removable computer storage media. The licensing medium 120 and the electronic device that uses the licensed electronic data need not have a wired connection. A wireless connection, e.g., an infrared or radio frequency (RF) link, may be used.</i><p>DOES THIS PATENT APPLY?: In general, this seems to be a patent on a license system involving a separate, ""portable"" license module (like a dongle or smartcard) that provides license data and can be updated with new license data from the server. Putting aside the question of whether this deserves a patent in the first place, I wonder what about the guy's Android app involves a separate, removable license medium. What's their basis for suing?<p>Especially in the light of:<p><i>Speaking for Laminar Research, we used only the technology that was provided to us by Google for copy protection in our Android App X-Plane we used exactly the copy protection Google gave us! And, of course, this is what Google provides to EVERYONE ELSE THAT IS MAKING A GAME FOR ANDROID!</i><p>KEY CLAIM: And here's the claim at the heart of the dispute, which I should've gone to at the start:<p><i>107. Computer code executable on an electronic device to prevent unauthorized access to electronic data stored on the electronic device, the computer code comprising: code for storing license data on a portable licensing medium configured to communicate with the electronic device; code for determining whether to allow access to the electronic data based on the license data; code for verifying the license data stored on the licensing medium by communicating with a registration authority having verification data; and code for providing updated license data received from the registration authority to the licensing medium.</i><p>This very clearly says that the license data is stored on a ""portable licensing medium"". If they're referring to license data stored in the internal RAM or SD card of a smartphone, then it collapses to the traditional license-data-and-server model and it doesn't make sense to talk about a portable licensing medium any more.<p>It's patent nonsense, literally.",1347651752

If they do not keep writing needless code and mindlessly adding features and then _forcing_ you to use their software (you are not given a choice; hello Apple), they become less important.  The focus then (properly) becomes Moore's Law.<p>And your machine gets more and more powerful.  That comes from the hardware.  Software does not add more power.  It drains power.<p>But you will not likely see much of the gains from Moore's Law as a home user; you only see ""new"" software.

Writing power hungry programs is perfectly acceptable (I love writing code) BUT _forcing_ people to use it is not cool.  Users are not often given a choice to keep using ""yesterday's"" software (even if it still works).  Even if it would let them see the gains from Moore's Law.  That is a travesty.

This makes a transition much, much harder.""</i><p>Have you considered the cost to move a single community? Facebook has a lot of users but it also has a lot of communities. So the durability will be determined in part by how interconnected those communities are. So for example if everyone in your school is on Facebook, great but who else is on Facebook that you share with? If its nobody then the 'school' community is independent of the greater Facebook user base for you, it could move en masse to another service and the members would continue to be well served. Now do you have college friends and church friends and work friends? If so then you've got a more complex social web and moving to a different service for your college friends means you now check two services instead of one in order to keep up, that is a 'negative' on your part and if enough people in a community have this same constraint then the community is more tightly bound to Facebook.<p>Because of that reasoning I'd claim that it does not matter how many people currently use Facebook, rather it depends on how difficult it is for an arbitrary community to move to a new service. If movement is easy (or becomes desirable) then you could see mass migrations.<p><i>""facebook is not only used for facebook, but for many third-party apps as well. People will keep their facebook accounts so that they can log in to external services.""</i><p>This is clearly a 'stickyness' mechanism that Facebook has implemented for the reason you state. If you log into a bunch of places using your Facebook account then having a Facebook account is important, and leaving Facebook is 'hard'. Clearly this is in the interest of Facebook and the reason they offer the account connecting APIs that they do.<p>There are two potential problems with this however, one is that Facebook is less willing to reciprocate with data access to web sites that use their APIs (see the Google / Facebook problems as exhibit A) which makes that linkage less desirable to the third party. If it is a big enough problem they will drop it.<p>The second problem continues to be the profiling problem which is that Facebook knows a lot about you and this simply adds to their knowledge. As people become uncomfortable with that they may choose <i>not</i> to use Facebook login even if it is available for just that reason.<p>It will be interesting to see how durable these defenses are against defection. I don't doubt for a minute that Facebook will die at some point. The question though is will it be be 10 years from now, or 20, or 5. If you look at companies that have spanned several generations there is a more fundamental value proposition at work than 'friends.'",1347651201

If Apple sells a billion iPhones, the R&D costs you talk about would be the same amount.<p>One could imagine a company that does $1M in R&D, has a price per unit of $650, and a cost per unit of $500.  Similarly, a company could do $100M in R&D, have a price of $650, and a cost per unit of $200.  At some number of units (and I'm just being lazy here since I don't want to do the math), the second company makes more money.<p>A statement like this isn't meant to sound like Apple isn't offering customers a good value, but rather that the cost to supply 1 additional iPhone is small compared to the revenue gained by selling 1 additional iPhone - basically, that a lot of Apple's costs are R&D, not component costs.

Their business is making money off your searches. However, companies like Facebook, Amazon (and to a lesser degree in-app searches) are stealing that functionality from them. The more searches you do directly in Amazon (or in the future in Facebook ) the less Google will know about you, the less intelligent their searches will be and the less money they'll make.<p>However, if Google is the ISP, they'll be able to learn from EVERYTHING you do on the internet. Doing a search directly on Facebook? Google will watch that and learn what you (and millions of others like you) mean by your search terms and what's important to you. This will not only improve Google search, Google voice-dictation, etc but they'll also use it to make a smart interface into the Google Fiber TV and internet similar to what XBox now does.

It's not a matter of twisting anything.<p>""The price of a commodity when sold in a given market.""<p>There are two markets. There is a primary (unregistered) and a secondary (registered) market.  This is a fact.<p>The price of a domain in the primary market is ~$10 (we'll ignore the fact some registries DO charge based on name quality - see .tv for an example of this).  The price in the secondary market is whatever is agreed upon by the buyer and seller.  There is NO set price, it's a normal functioning capitalist market.<p>Nobody is holding anything hostage in the secondary market. It's simply supply and demand.  The domains are worth what someone is willing to sell them for and what someone else is willing to pay. There is no morality involved, it's capitalism in its purest form.  You aren't owed anything and you don't owe anyone anything.  There is a near infinite supply in the primary market for you to invest in.  By using the secondary market you're acknowledging the value someone else has recognized before you in the primary market.<p>As far as it would still be worth $10 argument, that's laughable. As someone who has owned over a thousand domains and made a living off it, I've had domains earning thousands of dollars per month just being parked. You think those are still worth $10?  That's idiotic.  As far as the ""besides anyone else"" portion of your argument. Also stupid.  Of course you will see a downward sloping demand curve for ANYTHING. That doesn't mean its worth the lowest value on the curve.  Supply AND Demand.  There are two sides to this simple equation. The supply for domain names is unique in every circumstance. You can't get another uniquename.com. You can get something else, but there is only 1 uniquename.com. So the owner is more than able to try and go for the highest point on the demand curve. (S)He only has the opportunity to sell once.<p>You're upset because you didn't/don't get what you want for an irrationally low price.  You probably think its unfair someone else did get it, and that their time, effort and investment aren't worth anything.  Well, I think your product is stupid and a waste of time, effort and investment should I get the domain instead of you after you own it?  Would that be fair?<p>We may not get along but your argument is nonsensical. I will probably never change that line of thinking because people who think things are always unfair are bound to constantly look for someone or something else to blame.

There's some truth to that, but I think it misses the forest for the trees. Knowledge is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to excellence in software development.<p>Think of programming like writing an essay. Clearly some knowledge is required; you need to include some information in the essay or it's completely pointless. But the difference between a good essay, one that persuades the reader, and a poor essay isn't in the information it contains. It's in the flow of ideas, the juxtaposition of opposites, the emotional connotation of a well-chosen word, the ruthless elimination of extraneous words. The quality of a good essay comes from the skillful presentation of ideas as much as the ideas themselves.<p>Programming is similar. It's <i>hard</i>. Doing it well requires more than just knowledge of syntax or data structures or algorithms. It requires identifying the essential elements of the problem at hand, extracting their essence and crystallizing it as code. It means writing code that so simple that it seems so obvious and unremarkable that anyone could have done it. It means being able to move up and down the tower of abstraction, from bits flying around in memory to the concepts and language of the business domain, and from individual lines of code up to architecture and processes. It's a skill, like writing or pottery or motorcycle maintenance.<p>Now from your ""I'm fine"" list it sounds like maybe you're not interested in excellence in programming per se, just in the business value you can create by programming well enough to solve your customers' problems. That's a perfectly reasonable. That's how I approach design.<p>But if you want to be a good programmer, to really master the skill, then you need a bit more than a few tools that can solve most problems, and being able to learn new skills just in time. Which is not to say that an academic education is necessary. But it does mean you'll have to learn things that aren't immediately applicable.<p>Knowing how to solve a problem 5 different ways means you can choose the best way for the current situation, knowing that the other 4 solutions will probably be called-for another time. I've been in situations where ""slick stuff"" was absolutely appropriate. (For example, I once solved some tricky timing issues in multithreaded code by using continuations. Another time I used parser combinators to drastically reduce the size and complexity of a family of parsers, and eliminated a lot of bugs.)<p>I'm self-taught too, so I get it. But I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the idea of building up a good foundation for your skills, if you're interested in developing them.",1347649992

I also don't subscribe to the ""all PE guys are evil and unnecessary"" philosophy but with just this teaser description it would be easy to think I support it. Anyway, on to your answer.<p>Private Equity firms typically want to run their portfolio companies as profitably as possible.  This means cutting down service, R&D, technology, etc as lean as possible without damaging the existing product or brand.<p>It also rules out lots of room for innovation as the companies chief reason for existing becomes generating enough profits to pay off the individual company's outstanding debt.<p>Why is there debt?  Private Equity firms will buy a company, streamline its operations, increase its profits, and demonstrate to banks/investors that it is financially stable.  Once they've done that they raise lots of debt against the promise to pay off that debt with the future, dramatically increased, profits.  They use the debt to pay themselves a bonus for taking over the company and fixing it.<p>Why not wait and just pocket the company's profits over time?  Well, that's how Warren Buffet does it (sort of), but by loading the company with debt they get their bonus sooner increasing the IRR for their own investors.<p>edit: phrasing.",1347649793

This is because not all unemployment is bad.<p>Frictional unemployment is actually a <i>good</i> thing (to a certain extent), because the alternative is having people stuck doing jobs they don't want when better jobs are available.<p>Structural unemployment is what happens when $old_industry dies because $disruptive_tech_company changes the market. It's definitely bad for the unemployed (who will never be re-employed in the same field), but it's usually the result of positive improvements to society at large. The 'solution' is that those people losing their jobs need to be retrained to work in another field, which is admittedly difficult, or retire.<p>Cyclical unemployment is undeniably bad. That's the result of boom-and-bust economies - people over-hiring during bubbles, and then having to lay off en masse when the market contracts. (The problem is largely that the people are being dumped into the jobs marketplace all at once, creating a glut, instead of being more evenly distributed).<p>The rest - someone who's employed but at a salary lower than what they'd like, or someone who retires because they're laid off... <i>that's not unemployment</i>. Someone may dislike it and they may think it's a 'problem' that needs to be 'fixed', but they need to realize that they're talking about something completely different from unemployment.<p>As for <i>real</i> unemployment, the ideal value is a point of debate amongst economists because it is tricky to measure, but somewhere in the ballpark of 5% is a commonly accepted value for the target 'natural rate' of unemployment.<p>That is, a sustained, unwavering value of 5% unemployment is actually the target for a healthy economy.",1347649647

Fiat allocation of a fixed resource, sure, but ISO does fiat allocation of OID space and it works because folks are free to grow as much as they want below it. As I recall one of the original 'next gen' IP proposals was like a huge address translation cloud, IPs were encapsulated in yet another layer which provided 'context' for the IP address inside. Basically every entity got their own 32 bit address space and ingress/egress to the Internet resulted in encapsulation and some additional router magic. One of the arguments against was the huge additional bandwidth cost. Of course we didn't realize at the time that few protocol changes could waste as much bandwidth as SPAM does.<p>The other challenge is that a functioning liquid market for IP addresses would most likely lead to speculation in IP address blocks. Worse is buying an address block from someone in Germany so that packets have to go to Germany first (top level static routing) to the router where they are re-allocated and then to their 'real' destination router. All very inefficient.<p>I, like other folks at Sun, was a big fan of a more modest 64 bit address proposal for V6, but alas it was not to be. That the conversion has taken as long as it has (and still isn't ""here"" nearly enough for a lot of users) really illustrates the dangers of the argument to 'permanently' fix things[1]. But innumeracy aside, the confounding issue is that IP addresses are 'structural' like telephone numbers and managing mobility of structural identifiers is always challenging (the cellular market deals with this all the time) so creating a truly liquid marketplace for these identifiers would ideally include fixing the structural issues which would allow the constraints to be fixed and thus eliminate the market.<p>Bottom line, it would have been great if folks had thought of that first, but they didn't and while future protocol developers can (and should) benefit from that experience, we're stuck with V4 address blocks that are stuck in various regions of the world.<p>[1] The most persuasive argument against 64 bit addresses was that this would only push the problem down the road, whereas 128 bit addresses fixed things once and for all.",1347649624

I'm not sure if they have for this round, but every other year, they simply changed upgrade eligibility for iPhone users right before the iPhone came out.<p>The problem is that this is very expensive.  An iPhone costs $650 and you get it for $200.  That means that the carrier is eating $450.  Even if you argue that a carrier is getting a discount and it's only costing them $300-350, they have to earn that back.  $300-350 over 12 months is $25-29.17 per month that they have to earn back, plus interest.  So, you have a $30 data plan, and only $0.83-$5 of that is going to actually implementing, maintaining, etc. the network.  If they're subsidizing the device by $400, giving you an upgrade ever 12 months would mean taking a loss of $40 not including the cost of creating and maintaining the network.<p>So, it's quite detrimental to a company's bottom line to offer that to the point that it isn't wonderfully feasible.  Sure, you can say that it gets you the voice plans of those people who switch and maybe that can go to the subsidy as well and whatnot, but the margins are thin.  I'm quite literally paying $40/mo for my iPhone plan as an add-on to a family plan (plus 1/5th of $20 for texting ($4) and 1/5th of $70 for voice ($14)).  So, I'm paying a total of $58 and getting a $450 discount on the device.  $450 over 12 months is $37.50 plus interest and so I would only be paying $20.50 per month for my actual usage.  Even if I bring my own phone, there isn't a carrier that would give me a price near that low.<p>Frankly, I think it would be better for uses to pay the $649 up-front and have cheaper plans (and this does happen in many countries and can happen here if you want to buy the iPhone 5 for T-Mobile).  However, even there I wouldn't be getting such a value.  T-Mobile offers 500 minutes plus texting plus 2GB of data for $50/mo.  For $8 more on a family plan, I'm getting $450 off my device which even if I can only upgrade every 24 months is an $18.75/mo value.<p>It would definitely be a huge differentiator.  AT&T did this for many years to keep Apple fans happy and to prevent their yelling from overwhelming the press around the new device.  However, it's really expensive.  Even if you gained more customers, it likely wouldn't be worth it.",1347649415

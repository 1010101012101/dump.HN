1927320,comment,1927275,1927275,0,0,swombat,,,"Calling these ""lying qualifiers"" seems a bit excessive.<p>""To be honest"", for example, is extremely common and doesn't all that often precede lies, despite its face value meaning. Sure, sometimes it precedes a lie, but then, so does the word ""the"". For example, ""Look, to be honest, I really don't know why the server crashed yet, but I'll do what I can to find out."" This is a sentence that many who run startups will have uttered at one point in their life without any intention of misleading anyone.<p>Even the ""ultimate but-head"" that the author presents, ""I'm not saying that..."", which he implies means ""I'm pretending that I'm not saying that..."", is not at all such a clear case. ""I'm not saying that X"" can and often does mean, very simply, that you want to be clear where your next statement stops. For example: ""I'm not saying that the deal is off, but we're going to have to really work on clauses 3 and 4 before we can move forward."" or even, more melodramatically, ""I'm not saying that you murdered her, I really don't think there's enough evidence to make such a case at this point, but the evidence really doesn't look great for you right now.""<p>Seeing as the author is clearly quite knowledgeable about words and their meanings, the question is, then, why is she making such a flimsy case? The answer is, perhaps, to be found in the conclusion:<p><i>Please don’t take this the wrong way — and really, I hate to say it — but the true audience for the but-head may not be our listeners, but ourselves.</i>",1290358659

For example, if the counterfeit pile is initially measured with one coin and Delta is -1 (29 modulo 30), you set D1 to 1, but D2 will be 28, 29, or 30. You cannot determine Delta or the counterfeit pile with such values of D1 and D2 using your algorithm.<p>It's certainly not the case that D{1,2} <= 20 as your comments suggest, and you seem to realize this by checking for D1 >= 25.

Specifically, the issue here is that uniform convergence does not imply convergence in length or area or any other such measures.

Now imagine two circles with half of the diameter, lined up so that the diameter lines align. Now split those two in four, etc. The circle becomes a snaking line whose total length doesn't change, and the snaking line converges uniformly to the line. Clearly, however, pi is not 1.<p>What you need is convergence in position _and_ angle.

    <%= f.text_field :things %>

The two best options I came up with are:<p>1. Feed the embedded code to Ripper as it comes in and use that to keep track of the lexical context. Ripper is pretty fast so it might not be a significant performance hit, but it only works in Ruby 1.9 and I don't know if a comparable parser for 1.8 exists.<p>2. Use a setter method like _buf= to append to the output buffer, and don't wrap the embedded expressions in parens. Because the = operator has such low precendence, the generated code will almost always behave as intended, but there are a few lower precendence operators that will break like ""and"", ""or"", and postfix ""if"", ""unless"", ""while"" and ""until"".",1290357162

1927245,comment,1926515,1926515,0,0,ltjohnson,,,"I'm a 5th year PhD student who is teaching a large (80 student) section of a course, this is the 4th course I've taught.  I've also taken plenty of exams as a student, and they are still fresh in mind.<p>I would want to know more information before I decided the students were cheating or not.  The instructor refereed to an ""exam room"", and gave an hour range that the new exam could be taken.  So the students are not all taking the exam at the same time, this makes it seem possible that the exam is online.  If the exam is online, and the students can take it at home vs take it in a proctored room, that would change what would be cheating.  If it were online at home (I don't think so from the video) then reviewing the test bank while taking the exam would be cheating.  If not, then having seen a question before the exam may or may not be cheating, depending on HOW you saw the question.<p>If you did not acquire questions in an unethical way, then it's not cheating, it's just studying.  As an instructor, I will sometimes put problems from the book onto my exam.  If the students worked the problems before because they were studying hard, then good for them!  I want my students to study, because it will help them learn.  I also provide a sample exam with previous exam questions on it; I write most of my own questions and it's important for students to get used to my style.  As a student, I had to take a written exam for my PhD.  When I was studying for the exam I asked Professors for help, one of my Professors gave me some of his questions.  I worked out every single question.  He also submitted one of his existing questions to the exam and I recognized it when I was taking the exam.  Cheating?  No.  I just got lucky (and worked my ass off).<p>If test questions are acquired by malicious means, or knowing that they are going to be on the exam, or are the test bank that is going to be used to make the exam.  Then it is cheating.  So if students knew that the questions came from a test bank, and downloaded the test bank (I'm sure it's on the web somewhere) to gain an advantage they cheated.<p>Finally, as an instructor.  Writing a decent exam is surprisingly hard.  My goal with an exam is two-fold, figure out how well the class as a whole is doing, and separate the students into their grade groups.  The ideal exam has some problems that even the D students can answer (to separate them from the F's) and some problems (usually just 1 problem) that are a stretch for the A students.  And a mix of medium problems for everyone.  If you have too many easy problems, the grades will creep up and you won't separate students.  If you have too many hard problems, the grades will creep down and you won't separate students.  Writing an exam from scratch is very time consuming.  I use my private test bank, and try to add 1 or 2 new questions to the bank when I'm writing each exam.  I can understand (but don't agree with) an instructor pulling entirely from an existing bank to write an exam.",1290355374

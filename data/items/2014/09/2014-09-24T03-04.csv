These arguments fall apart the moment &#x27;stealing it&#x27; becomes part of the discussion.<p>The correct way to protest a content offering in our society is to not consume it. That&#x27;s actually true of any consumer product. If you just steal it instead, you&#x27;re signaling the producer that you do want their product; you&#x27;d like to think that the proper response would be to make a product that entices you to buy instead of steal, but unless almost everyone is stealing, it&#x27;s probably cheaper to lobby for the DMCA. Which is what happened.<p>As far as the frictional costs, etc. alluded to earlier, I actually have no idea what that means. I think it may mean there is a lot of hand-waving built-in to what media costs, making it very difficult for me as a consumer to know what I&#x27;m actually paying for and, if I&#x27;m value conscious, to determine whether it&#x27;s worth the price.",1411531148

We all know there&#x27;s a market, demand, etc. And, your interpretation of the original post is pretty much how I interpreted it as well.<p>But, it still begs my original question: why is it OK for &quot;consumers to get the movie either way?&quot; Why is it someone else&#x27;s problem?<p>That someone else actually owns the movie. Where else do we actually believe it&#x27;s OK to take something that belongs to someone else simply because we don&#x27;t like their terms? Then, we turn around and blame them for our stealing it because they should have offered better terms?<p>It&#x27;s just weird. I mean, if people want to steal something, then just steal it and be ready to pay the consequences as with anything else. But, all of this rationalization that they somehow deserve to own it because they were inconvenienced by the rightful owner is what I don&#x27;t understand.",1411531058

Pocket Jump includes: ... Cigarette Lighter Socket/Power Port Plug for transferring power from the Pocket Jump to your car battery using the internal wiring of the vehicle.</i>&quot;<p>This is ridiculous. To jump-start a car, you need to be able to power the starter motor to turn over the engine. A starter motor draws around 100 amps of current in round numbers. More if the engine is cold (which is likely if the battery is dead). There&#x27;s no way that a device that fits in your pocket can store enough energy to start your car. And even if it could, there&#x27;s no way you can pull that much current through the cigarette lighter plug inside your car, since that circuit is protected with a fuse that&#x27;s rated at somewhere around 10-20 amps.",1411530758

Meanwhile they do adverts on-screen that don&#x27;t tell you when the featured shows are actually to be on.<p>Anyway, not to go too far OT: I searched &quot;fawlty towers&quot;, no hits. Hmm, what data are they opening up? Then I tried the &quot;politics&quot; link to see what wealth of info there was, then &quot;welsh politics&quot;. That last link just gives a terse definition with a source of dbpedia. Okay? Perhaps that&#x27;s an anomaly. Tried &quot;politics&quot; again and the top subordinate link &quot;politics&quot;, similar terse page with 2 source links wikipedia and dbpedia. So far no sign of any BBC data ...?<p>So, is this just a framework at present without being linked to the data?

What&#x27;s the use case that finds utility in that page?<p>&quot;Beta&quot;, so this is consider to be fully working and ready to be used except for potential bugs?

Definitely\nyes.<p>Second, is that all that can work?  I don&#x27;t think\nso.<p>Third, do I suggest that the alternative approach I\ndescribe here will be common and/or always better\nthan what Altman describes?  No.  Sometimes better?\nI do believe so.  But even if the alternative\napproach is rare, that should not be a huge obstacle\nsince the success Altman is talking about, the goal,\nis also rare.  That is, for the rare successes, we\nshould expect that some of the means will also be\nrare and not common.<p>But for the alternative approach, given that it is\nrare, we should have some solid evidence of its\neffectiveness, and I believe that we can.<p>I want to propose that it can be possible to have an\nidea, test it, essentially just on paper, and, if it\npasses the test, be quite sure the resulting product\nwill be good and fairly sure the resulting company\nwill be successful.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m proposing that the alternative approach\nprovides a way to have the idea be by far the most\nimportant part of the work and the rest, e.g., the\nexecution, be routine.<p>Or I would say that a <i>good</i> idea is one that makes\nit through the <i>filters</i> of my alternative approach.\nThen I am claiming that with a bad idea, yes,\nexecution is everything but with a good idea\nexecution is routine.<p>Yes, to me, the <i>ideas</i> like Altman describes look\nto me as far too unpromising to be taken seriously\nand promise that, yes, indeed, execution will be\nmany times more difficult than the idea.  Indeed,\nAltman is admitting that many start ups fail, that\nbuilding a successful start up is difficult.  I\nwould agree that, starting with a bad idea, building\na successful start up is difficult.<p>Now, for the alternative approach for finding a good\nidea for a start up:<p>First, the alternative approach is very selective,\nthat is, rejects a lot of ideas.  Some of the ideas\nthe approach rejects will be able to be the basis of\nsuccessful companies.  The alternative approach\nrejects ideas when it just cannot build a rock solid\ncase that the idea is good.  E.g., the alternative\ndoes not know how to conclude that the ideas for\nFacebook or Twitter would lead to success.  The\nalternative wants to accept only good ideas and in\ndoing so will reject a lot of good ideas.  The\nalternative approach asks for a lot from an idea,\nand many good ideas will not have that much.<p>Second, Altman does emphasize that a need and a\ncorresponding solution one person sees in their own\nlife can be relevant.  Okay, I&#x27;ve been there and\ndone that, that is, I&#x27;ve seen needs and solutions.<p>Third, what I&#x27;m proposing for an alternative is, at\nleast in broad terms, and compared with what Altman\ndescribes, much older, much more thoroughly tested,\nand with a much better, really excellent, track\nrecord.<p>Actually, we all know at least something, maybe a\nlot, about the alternative and its track record.  I\nlearned about the alternative early in my career\ndoing mostly US DoD projects around DC and also some\nother experiences, but there is much more\ninformation about the alternative readily available\nfar from me.<p>So:<p>(1) Need.<p>To make the alternative work, we have to start with\na suitable need, i.e., <i>market need,</i> that is, a\nsuitable problem to solve.  We want the first good\nor a much better solution to be, obviously, no\ndoubt, a &quot;must have&quot; and not just a &quot;nice to have&quot;.<p>Next, for this need, we want to find the first good\nor a much better solution, presented just on paper.<p>Then we want to evaluate the solution, also just on\npaper.  Sorry, no, we don&#x27;t &quot;get out of the\nbuilding&quot; and talk to other people.<p>Big example of such a need?  Okay, we&#x27;d like to have\na safe, effective, inexpensive one pill taken once\nto cure any cancer.  So, yes, early on, for\nFacebook, Twitter, Snapchat, a lot of doubt.  For\nsuch a cancer pill, we have &quot;no doubt&quot;; to know this\nwe don&#x27;t have to &quot;get out of the building&quot;, ask\npeople, throw trial solutions against a wall to see\nif there is interest, etc.<p>(2) Solution.<p>Given the need from (1), we try to find a solution.\nIf we fail here, and likely we will, we return to\n(1) and find another need.  E.g., clearly so far the\none pill cure for any cancer will fail here for at\nleast a long time.<p>We want a solution that we are sure, &quot;no doubt&quot;,\nwill be the first good or much better.<p>Here&#x27;s a way:  Start with the real problem and see\nwhat about it we can assume.  Then convert this\nproblem and its assumptions into a mathematical\nproblem.  So, we are limiting ourselves to needs\nthat lead faithfully to mathematical problems.\nSorry, no intuitive heuristics need apply.<p>Next find a mathematical solution.<p>Develop the mathematical solution just on paper, as\ncarefully done theorems and proofs, and then\nseverely check the proofs.<p>Then observe that it is totally clear that the\nmathematical solution will be fully close enough to\nthe first good or much better solution we want for\nthe need.<p>If any of the work here in step (2) fails, then\nreturn to step (1)<p>(3) Product.<p>Write software to do the data manipulations\nspecified by the mathematical solution.  Severely\ncheck the software.  That&#x27;s essentially the product.<p>If fail here, then return to (1).<p>Track record?

But in each case they provided\nthe intended solution for the need.  As we have\nexplained, to have a successful technical solution\nlead to a successful solution in business, we want\nsuch a solution to be a &quot;must have&quot;; else we return\nto (1).<p>The high bypass turbofan jet engine a commercial\n&quot;must have&quot;?  Darned right:  It saves an ocean of\nexpensive jet fuel.  How?  Simple:  Burning jet fuel\nreleases energy.  Want to convert that energy to\nkinetic energy and get the resulting momentum.  But\nfor mass m and velocity v, kinetic energy is (1/2)\nmv^2 and momentum is just mv.  So, we pay in energy\n(1/2) mv^2 and get in the momentum we want mv.<p>So, since in kinetic energy we have v^2 but in\nmomentum have just v, to get more of our desired\nmomentum from our given, available energy, we want m\nto be large and v to be small.  So, mostly we want\nto use the hot gasses from the combustion to turn a\nbig ducted propeller that moves a huge mass of air\nat a low velocity.  Instead, the military jet\nengines intended for supersonic speeds, and long\nused in commercial aviation because they were\navailable, move a smaller mass at high velocity.\nSo, for commercial, subsonic flight, a high bypass\nturbofan is a &quot;must have&quot;. Then have the first good\none or a much better one, as we have assumed, and\nvery much should have a successful business.",1411529134

8359762,comment,8357089,8357089,9,0,userbinator,,,"The main issue I have with this form of testing is that it&#x27;s basically measuring the <i>ultimate</i> endurance characteristics of the flash - running program/erase cycles until some piece of the flash becomes completely unusable. The majority of the time the first failure will occur in a user data block, but there&#x27;s a nonzero chance that it&#x27;s in a block mapping table or the firmware itself, and that will definitely cause catastrophic failure. The article seems to be implying that it&#x27;s OK to write more data than the manufacturer specifies, but this is not something anyone should ever be doing in a real-world scenario, because retention is inversely proportional to endurance and also (exponentially!) to temperature. A drive that retains data for a week at 20C may not be able to at 30C or even 25C.<p>The 840 Pro&#x27;s reallocated sector count appears to have started rising at 600TB, which is roughly 2400 P/E cycles, on average, of the whole flash - this is not surprising and agrees with the typical endurance figure of 2K-3K for 2x nm MLC.<p>I&#x27;ve never agreed fully with the reasoning behind MLC -  yes, it&#x27;s technically twice the capacity for the same die area/price as SLC (or alternatively, half the area/price for the same capacity), but it&#x27;s also nearly <i>two orders of magnitude</i> less endurance/retention and requires far more controller complexity for error correction and bad-block management. In a storage device, I think reliability is more important than capacity - even with backups, no one wants to lose <i>any</i> data. The tradeoff doesn&#x27;t make so much sense to me - theoretically, you could buy an MLC SSD that wears out after a few years (thus needing replace it and copy the existing data over to the new one, along with all the risks that causes, etc.), or for only twice as much, an SLC one that probably won&#x27;t ever need replacing.<p>A 256GB SLC SSD with 100K P/E cycle flash is conceivably good for 25PB and 5-10 years, or <1PB and over a century... i.e. you could probably use one for archival if stored in a good environment. Part of me thinks the manufacturers just don&#x27;t want to make such long-lasting products, hence the strong association of SLC to &quot;enterprise&quot; products. (And the much higher pricing of SLC SSDs, more than the raw price of NAND would suggest.)",1411529087

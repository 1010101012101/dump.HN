But again and again the &quot;myths&quot; are proving to be the truth. Obviously not always. We live in an age that we tend to overestimate to great degree of our technology and underestimate the raw power of human mind. The ancients had both the means and the method to produce high quality work. Moreover a historian that would lie most likely he would be discredited quite easily by other historians of his time and his books would fall into disuse. We should not also forget that the world back then was way smaller than it is now , news would spread fast and vocal accounts would have been much easier to be kept in memory for centuries.",1413068360

I&#x27;ll try to make a few points and not rant.<p>There is a reason that classes are like this. In my experience it is because if you try to have more participation in a large classroom it devolves quickly into chaos. Which you you little angels remember making sport of the substitute teacher? Putting 30 teenagers in a room with one adult and expecting them to sit for an hour every day and &quot;learn&quot; is laughably insane. Teachers that make it work do so by becoming wardens of their own little compound. And this is after all effective tools for discipline have been taken away from teachers and most parents and the slimy administrative politicians siding against you. Maybe if you could beat a little psychopath once in a while you would not have to put 99% of your classroom effort to shushing and threatening and other emotionally abusive crowd control techniques.<p>Ever heard of Sudbury schools? These are schools were they don&#x27;t make the kids do anything. There are no classes, standards or curriculum. Testing shows no significant academic difference with &quot;normal&quot; schools. Think about that: the effect of modern education is indistinguishable from a placebo.<p>Education is fucked from the ground up. It&#x27;s a stupid idea poorly executed.

Sure, and that kind of stuff does happen. And Apple likely makes decisions based on limiting their liability to that kind of thing. They have publicly stated that they objected to Ogg Theora because they had a patent license for H.264, and didn&#x27;t think it was worth the risk to ship something like Ogg Theora, which may be covered by unknown patents.<p>Now, H.264 may be covered by unknown patents as well. But based on the existence of the MPEG-LA and its patent pool, and the fact that they&#x27;d already invested in and exposed to any potential H.264 risk, they felt like there would be more risk to them to add Ogg Theora support than just sticking with H.264. Were they right? Who knows. But that is the decision they made.<p>Now, we are just speculating about why they hate the GPLv3 so much. But they obviously do, and they have both done a lot to use their own patents offensively, as well as being cautious about infringing patents as a defensive stance, so my best guess is that the patent clause is their concern.<p>But there&#x27;s no way for me to be sure; there&#x27;s not much point in continuing to discuss it, because it&#x27;s Apple that has made this decision, not me. I&#x27;m perfectly happy shipping GPLv3 covered software; if you want to know why Apple isn&#x27;t, you could try asking them, though are unlikely to get an answer.",1413067554

1307156,comment,1306470,1306470,0,0,tjmc,,,"Immediate solution: Scan your signature and use an email/web - fax service<p>Better answer:\nI've thought about this problem a lot. I think the concept of the fax machine itself isn't really the issue, it's the fact that it hasn't evolved from communicating via a 19.2K modem over POTS lines. All the alternatives are replacement technologies that don't offer a migration path from the established standard and make it harder to replicate a physical document from A to B.<p>- The fax via email/web alternatives are harder to use because scanning and printing are separate and often difficult steps.<p>- FOIP isn't trivially backwards compatible - you need a gateway provider and a service agreement to send to existing machines.<p>I think Google's cloud print service need to extend to cloud scanning. As a first step you could then have multifunction scanner/printer/copiers that attempt to contact the recipient via IP first and then either fall back to regular fax or use a proxy fax service. IP connections would offer: higher speed, higher resolution, colour, encryption and wireless connectivity.<p>The key is something that's still as easy as a fax machine. Any solution that doesn't focus on copying physical documents is solving a different problem. We already have email for that.",1272599787

1307153,comment,1306883,1307080,0,0,jayliew,,,"1) Understandable; and I'm learning through feedback from the comments :) Let's see if I understand you. The response will be whatever you specify it to be.<p>@cmercier said ""@jaysern hi !!!"" to me <a href=""http://twitter.com/cmercier/status/13104066344"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/cmercier/status/13104066344</a> and in response, my Twitter account responded automatically with ""@cmercier hey there!"" (I had specified that it should auto-respond to with exactly that response):  <a href=""http://twitter.com/jaysern/status/13104120410"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/jaysern/status/13104120410</a><p>2) I apologize for the confusion. RSR scans the tweets from 3 sources: from people you are following, tweets that have @mention'd you, and tweets from public_timeline; if something matches from those 3 sources, it will respond. Whether the person is a stranger or not. What I was explaining in [2], I now realize I didn't explain well.. is that the system does not <i>explicitly</i> search for keywords to respond to, outside of the 3 cases I mentioned above. Let's say 'blah' is a rare word. If you set a 'filter' (as you call it) to respond to a tweet containing 'blah', it will only respond only if that tweet was seen from those 3 places. In other words, if there's a person X who tweets ""blah"", but you're not following him, X does not @mention you, and X's tweet does not show in public_timeline, then there will not be an auto-response. (let me know if that is still confusing).<p>3) Yes, it's at <a href=""http://www.rapidsocialresponse.com/user/your_username_here"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rapidsocialresponse.com/user/your_username_here</a> - but that's good feedback for me to know (that users prefer that it not be displayed)<p>4) I didn't add a 'count', but I can do that from the back end so that users know exactly which entry auto-responded the most, and which didn't, and so forth.<p>I can certainly understand it comes off spammy, but would like to know the reasoning behind that, if you care to share more. It's definitely ripe for abuse .. which is something I will have to pay attention to.<p>I appreciate the feedback, quorge!",1272599752

It's a lot more intuitive than what you've currently got, I think. Your current ordering doesn't map to what I think it means (the current order seems to be ""meh"" on top, ""like"" in the middle, and ""boo"" at the bottom). The ""like"" action should be at the top.<p>Also, I'm not in love with the ""next"" rollover text. I assume it means ""skip"", but a user could interpret that as the <i>only</i> way to go to the next item, and upvoting or downvoting before ey're ready (for example, if ey read the first paragraph and like it). It's not horrible, since ey can hit the back button of eir browser, though.<p>Also, I can never decide whether to separate the ""upvote"" action from the ""save"" action. Reddit currently has separate functionality for those; HN has them in one. It's a simpler design to combine them, but there are times I want to save things on HN on a smaller list than my upvoted stories list. Ah, for now stick with them being the same; if it becomes a problem, add it later. I'm sure there are much more important things you could be doing on this site. :)",1272599507

Isn't that a commentary on the quality of American viewers? They are in the business of selling the audience to the advertisers.<p>That's the problem journalism is facing - funding.  Maybe more fundamentally, the divide between the social value of journalism and the monetary value.<p>I think everyone understands the first part of the problem - without money, a lot of journalism just goes away.  You can't afford investigations, foreign bureaus, thorough research, etc.  Even simple beat reporting gets worse when there aren't enough beat reporters to go around.<p>What worries me is the relatively unacknowledged second part of the problem:  Journalists end up doing MORE of the things that cost less money, or are more profitable, even if they aren't really good journalism.  Talking heads, sensationalist stories, reprinted press releases, etc.  There's also the more subtle corruption of PR agencies and political operatives that want to ""help"" journalists ""understand"" what just happened - even if the journalist is savvy enough to fight back, it still takes time (which is money!) to do that.  The less resources the journalist has, the easier they are to manipulate.<p>The social value of journalism is accurate information.  But ever since Craigslist punched a hole in the bottom of the classifieds market and let out all the profit, journalists can only make MONEY by getting a lot of eyeballs in a short time.

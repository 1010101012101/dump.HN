I.e. you&#x27;re using more complex calculations per-pixel for a smaller number of per-vertex/per-polygon computations.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to look into the question empirically of whether this optimization would be worthwhile.<p>Also it depends somewhat on the specifics of the application.  Two factors come to mind:<p>(1) Draw distance (drawing many faraway polys that are only a few pixels on-screen probably favors poly-count reduction more)<p>(2) Extra pixel shader complexity.  If you&#x27;re doing fancy per-pixel stuff with lighting or shadows or whatever, your optimization should become more attractive, because starting with your optimization and adding that extra stuff reduces the percentage of the per-pixel computation that&#x27;s spent on your optimization.",1373003863

5993581,comment,5991375,5992945,7,0,rayiner,,,"There is a basic impedance mismatch between the 4th and what technologists want the 4th to mean, which is this: even a liberal interpretation of the 4th amendment still characterizes it as a protection of privacy, but what the NSA is doing isn&#x27;t an invasion of your most intimate private information so much as it&#x27;s a potentially scary gathering together of information that isn&#x27;t really all that private but could be harmful by virtue of aggregation. The 4th amendment speaks in terms that are deeply intimate: your &quot;person&quot; and your &quot;house&quot; and your &quot;papers.&quot; It&#x27;s talking about your coat pocket and your desk drawer, places that nobody has access to except for those closest to you. But the row over the NSA&#x27;s activity is about information that literally hundreds of people (people who you have never even met!) at AT&T, Google, Facebook, etc, have access to. The fear is not people seeing information that was not meant for other eyes to see, because as a matter of fact we voluntarily expose that information to hundreds of other eyes, but rather the government aggregating information that could be abused.<p>I think the impedance mismatch is most clearly illustrated when you try to apply the text of the 4th amendment to something like the NSA getting call detail records from AT&T, or search histories from Google. The 4th amendment very clearly refers to &quot;their... papers.&quot; To this English speaker, it strains the definition of &quot;their&quot; (i.e. &quot;your&#x27;s&quot;) to say that some electronic record that AT&T or Google generated that you never even had access to much less actually possessed is nonetheless &quot;your&quot; private paper or effect.

So in this case what&#x27;s happened is the publisher has chosen to sell the book for $17.50, and the way you do that is by setting an entirely notional &quot;list price&quot; at 2x the intended wholesale price. But the $35 is not a real price; the real price in the publisher-bookstore exchange is $17.50. It&#x27;s then up to bookstores how much they want to mark the book up above $17.50. Here, Amazon is choosing to sell it for a 70% markup above wholesale, whereas previously they were selling it for a 30% markup.<p>(This is U.S.-specific; list prices mean different things in different countries.

In this context &quot;extraordinary claim&quot; means &quot;claim with a very low prior probability&quot;. The saying can be expressed more precisely as &quot;in order to upgrade to the level of expectation a hypothesis with a very low prior probability, it is necessary to make an observation of very low probability generally, but high probability given that the hypothesis is true.&quot; In other words, it&#x27;s essentially just Bayes&#x27; theorem.<p>And by no means are very-low-prior hypotheses inherently more useful. Certainly they have more impact than higher-prior hypotheses <i>if they are validated</i>, but in general, a very low prior means that a hypothesis is not worth wasting time considering.<p>In some cases, a hypothesis can be so extraordinary that it becomes practically impossible to verify by experiment. In this case, for example, the hypothesis is <i>so unlikely</i> that it is quite difficult to imagine an experiment (or set of experiments) whose outcome was <i>so unlikely</i> that it would actually make us expect that humans were descended from ape-pigs.",1373002844

5993556,comment,5990836,5992270,5,0,shizzy0,,,"> It seriously limits amount of people that can use your library<p>Yes, it does seriously limit the amount of people that can use your library--without giving anything back.<p>> hopefully you are open sourcing a library because you want to help as many people as possible.<p>Help as many people as possible do what?  Get rich by composing together a bunch of liberally licensed software to  do a task and then close sourcing it.  No, thank you.<p>I see licensing as a Hawk-Dove-Retaliator game[1] for modeling resource competition.  Each kind behaves differently: The Dove never fights and always flees.  The Hawk always attacks and never flees.  The Retaliator only attacks if attacked.  Pay off matrices describe in detail how well each kind does against the other.  Dove vs. Dove both do well; they share.  Hawk vs. Dove, the Hawk wins everything.  Hawk vs. Hawk, the beat each other up; both lose. Retaliator vs. Dove, just like Dove vs. Dove.  Retaliator vs. Hawk, like Hawk vs. Hawk.<p>My analogy is this: The BSD licensor is a Dove, the proprietary licensor is a Hawk, and the GPL licensor is a Retaliator.  If you want to be nice but make yourself vulnerable to exploitation, be a Dove; Doves like Doves, and Hawks love Doves--it&#x27;s popular.  If you want to get rich, then exploit all the Doves and be a Hawk; Doves worked hard, so you don&#x27;t have to.  If you want to have your work respected rather than exploited, be a Retaliator: happy to cooperate with those who cooperate, but willing to punish those who defect and refuse to cooperate.  Which of these strategies is stable in the long-term?  See the links below for a more detailed answer, but Doves certainly aren&#x27;t.<p>Doves may enjoy a wonderful period of peace and cooperation, but they&#x27;re so easily exploited that it makes one wonder how long it will last.  In a population of Doves, it&#x27;s best to be a Hawk.  However, a population of pure Hawks does terribly.  A population of Retaliators though is nearly immune from invasion.<p>Note: There are many salient differences between licensing and this animal behavior model.  I don&#x27;t contend that it is a perfect analogy, but I think it is worthwhile for considering long term trends.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)#Hawk-Dove"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)#Hawk-Dove</a>

If they really did have wheels, then it&#x27;s rather mind boggling (and rather implausible) that they didn&#x27;t apply the technology to something more practical.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to approach history/art-history of ancient cultures with a health dose of skepticism - especially ones that didn&#x27;t have a written language.

5993545,comment,5992002,5992185,3,0,kevin_nisbet,,,"IMS/QOS on LTE is actually a very complicated topic, as it goes beyond routing/QoS rules. I&#x27;ll try and comment on some of the points you hit on.<p>So to clear up a few things:
1. They assume all sip traffic must by their own, and route to their IMS Core
IMS SIP proxy information is relayed to the device when it attached to the network if it&#x27;s IMS capable. It&#x27;s up to the devices stack to use the proxy provided by the network, which as far as I&#x27;m aware no 3rd party software does at the moment.<p>2. Is Verizon using separate APNs for their voice and data.
Based on <a href=""http://support.verizonwireless.com/clc/devices/knowledge_base.html?id=46578"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.verizonwireless.com/clc/devices/knowledge_bas...</a> it appears they may use vzwims
I believe by convention, for roaming the &quot;ims&quot; APN is to be used, however, I&#x27;m having trouble locating the recommendation by either the GSMA or 3GPP, so now i&#x27;m not sure where I heard that.<p>3. routing/QoS rules that are rather nongranular
Actually, LTE has spent immense effort in providing capabilities and controls around prioritizing very specific traffic. In high level concept, when you use the IMS core to generate a SIP call, the local SIP proxies will have links back to the PCRF (policy server).<p>The PCRF is capable of generating IP Source/Destination rules that are sent to the network, to prioritize the specific RTP conversation. This is taken to the level in LTE network&#x27;s, where the LTE network depending on the rule will &quot;Guarantee&quot; the bitrate is available, and the rule is pushed to all aspects of the network include the eNodeB (Cell Site). The over the air scheduler in the eNodeB is to respect the QoS rules to ensure traffic such as conversational-voice does not receive jitter/packet loss from background traffic (such as file transfer). Obviously, if you don&#x27;t use the IMS core, you lose this capability, since it&#x27;s not based on packet inspection, but by the proxy server itself knowing a call is in progress, and creating dynamic QoS rules just for that call.<p>Even with the way net neutrality is going, from my view it looks like the standards body is providing the capabilities for a fairly QoS rich environment. Personally I don&#x27;t have a problem with, the network understanding that your doing web browsing, and to deliver a better experience, you get higher network priority for you&#x27;re basic web viewing, then the person down the street who&#x27;s doing background file transfer, and saturating the cell site. The net neutrality problem is, if the carrier tries to leverage this not for experience, but profiteering, or to block certain types of traffic. However, that&#x27;s a much larger debate that I don&#x27;t think belongs here.<p>4. Paying customer voice traffic should not have to compete for resources with your data traffic
This is effectively true already (see number 3 above). However, your point is more around that this is reason to block non-carrier SIP, which isn&#x27;t the case. As an operator, I can just lop it in with the rest of the background data traffic, and you receive a user experience that matches.<p>Since this is background data, there is also less of a guarantee that the service will work consistently, as it&#x27;s not something explicitly tested for or verified in the many pieces of network infrastructure. As is indicated in other posts, this sounds like issues with the ALG, however, there are all kinds of things that can go wrong, NAT, Firewall, IDS.<p>I once worked a problem with RTCP/RTP a number of years ago, where a bug in one of the network elements, actually got confused by the STUN packet, because it was being too smart and setting up rules based on inspection of RTCP. The funny thing about it, was that everything would&#x27;ve worked fine, if it wasn&#x27;t being too clever to try and solve the problem for us.<p>*I do work in the telecom industry, however, my views and comments do not reflect my employer in any way.

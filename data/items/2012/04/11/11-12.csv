If that's the case and they're not pursuing a dual license business strategy, I'd suggest that the Mozilla Public License 2.0 is a better choice.

3827073,comment,3825766,3826162,4,0,ttt_,,,"I don't think being scored in school and game scores are that much alike.<p>In games, a bad score can be re-tried usually as many times as it takes for you to be satisfied with it. You're not at a loss as long as you take the time to re-do them until a good score is earned. On the other, in school, usually, your bad score sticks. That's it for you. Better luck next time or you might fail the entire year. Retrying in school takes an entire year of your life, you have to re-do even the things that you got right. It's quite punitive. That's without mentioning social aspects of it (peer view, self-esteem, etc).<p>Also, there's a big difference between scores and game reward system. Game rewards (nowadays) are designed for addiction. Rewards begin plenty and often, then are made scarcer and occasional. Not any school system can beat that behavioral craving.",1334145533

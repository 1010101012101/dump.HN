There are a lot of similarities between Windows Azure Tables and DynamoDB, and the release of DynamoDB validates the Data Model we have provided for a few years now with Azure Tables<p> They both are NoSQL schema-less table stores, where a table can store entities with completely different properties<p> They have a two attribute (property) composite primary key.One property that is used for partitioning and the other property is for optimizing range based operations within a partition<p> Both of them have just a single index based on their composite primary key<p> Both are built for effectively unlimited table size, seamlessly auto scale out with hands off management<p> Similar CRUD operations<p>How Windows Azure Tables is implemented can be found in this SOSP paper and talk:\n<a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/11/20/windows-azure-storage-a-highly-available-cloud-storage-service-with-strong-consistency.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/11/...</a><p>As mentioned by someone else, one difference is that DynamoDB stores its data completely in SSDs, whereas, in Azure Storage our writes are committed via journaling (to either SSD or a dedicated journal drive) and reads are served from disks or memory if the data page is cached in memory.   Therefore, the latency for single entity small writes are typically below 10ms due to our journaling approach (described in the above SOSP paper).  Then single entity read times for small entities are typically under 40ms, which is shown in the results here:\n<a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2010/11/06/how-to-get-most-out-of-windows-azure-tables.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2010/11/...</a><p>Once and awhile we see someone saying that they see 100+ms latencies for small single entity reads and that is usually because they need to turn Nagle off, as described here:\n<a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2010/06/25/nagle-s-algorithm-is-not-friendly-towards-small-requests.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2010/06/...</a>",1327791529

3523517,comment,3522839,3523076,2,0,drostie,,,"Maybe. Tail recursion optimizes itero-recursive algorithms, turning them into iterative algorithms by eliminating the overhead.<p>Confused? Here are the iterative, recursive, and itero-recursive ways of writing the factorial function:<p><pre><code>    function fact_r(N) {\n        return N <= 0 ? 1 : N * fact_r(N - 1);\n    }\n    function fact_i(N) {\n        var acc = 1, i;\n        for (i = 1; i <= N; i += 1) {\n            acc *= i;\n        }\n        return acc;\n    }\n    function fact_ir(N, acc) {\n        acc = acc || 1; // default value of acc\n        return N <= 0 ? acc : fact_ir(N - 1, N * acc);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo the accumulator variable becomes an argument variable which may have to be separately initialized. The key feature which makes something optimized for ""tail calls"" is that when f(something) wants to recurse, it returns f(something else). In other words, certain conditional logics can happen, but don't leave an operation like the ""n <i>"" in ""n </i> recurse(n - 1)"" on the stack or else you can't get rid of the function call. It's not even a special optimization -- basically you can move one line in the compiler a couple steps ahead of where you might have automatically written it, and it suddenly treats iteration and tail-recursion the same.<p>So that's the difference. If you can understand fact_ir, which does the iterative idea in a recursive syntax, then you can understand tail recursion.",1327789741

Instead of doing a long form like everyone else, let's blow up a picture of a guy (me) on the left, put a video in the middle, and put some bullet points to the right with a signup button on bottom.  Short and to the point, and incidentally, a technique that's been in use by print advertising since the beginning of print advertising.<p>So where exactly is the line? (and I'm asking because I'm truly curious if I've crossed it)  3 bullet points about your product is nothing new.  The smiling guy you can relate to with a testimonial isn't new.  Some screenshots or a product video above the fold isn't new.  But I certainly wouldn't give myself a ton of credit for originality in landing page design.

For example, if I visit Facebook, I would be charged a penny. If I clicked on any page on Facebook, I would also be charged a penny.<p>You could set a certain amount of page exemptions for specific sites (ie I could read 10 Hacker News articles a day without being charged), and you could set your own price for each page click (if you're wealthy, you're probably not going to care about a penny and may instead want to do 5 cents or more). Basically, the structure of the app is completely in your control. You can even turn it off or on depending on your schedule.<p>My initial thought (and only basing this on me so far) is that this would be better than apps like SelfControl because it wouldnt be completely denying the behavior. With SelfControl, I get pissed that the app is telling me what I can and cant do. With this app though, I would still have complete freedom, it would just be coming at a more apparent cost.<p>Proceeds of the app would just go to me. Rather than feeding a charity where you might feel good about yourself in spite of wasting time reading worthless crap on the internet, it should be an additional incentive that youre just feeding me, the selfish developer.<p>It seems to me like this community would be the target audience for this type of thing.

Without that book I wouldn't have launched the professional blog that was my main source of income for several years (more than the book was!). Without that professional blog, I wouldn't have got the podcasting gigs or launched the weekly newsletter which has now turned into 5 profitable newsletters and has just helped me become co-chair of an O'Reilly conference.<p>This is not to brag but to show the ""chains"" that can happen by putting yourself out there. It's totally unpredictable but increasing your ""luck surface area"" has amazing outcomes. Also, consider Jeff Atwood, a similar chain arises.",1327788194

If I call you on a discrepancy and you have a proof that you have specific expertise that are worth the difference, the ball is then in my court to evaluate if we want to pay for it and if it is indeed worth it.<p>However, even if I determine you're worth it, I will counter with a trial period and say (in writing) that you will get your top offer when and if you prove your <i>worth</i> to me and to the company.  I am curious to know how would you react to that type of counter, if you don't mind sharing.<p>The original comment, though, lead me to believe that the poster does this <i>as a rule</i>, asking for 120% of the top and expecting to get 90%. And while it is often the case that these hiring managers do play the game, I am merely drawing the attention that there are people out there like me (albeit probably not very common) who are not going to look favourably at ridiculous salary requests.<p>I can't help my gut reaction.  I do, however, make room to change my mind and if there is meat behind your request, I will readjust my thinking.  If I catch you in a bluff, however, because you think it's what you're <i>supposed</i> to do...outcome - not so good.  :-)",1327788014

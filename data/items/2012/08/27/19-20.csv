It accepted a legitimate (!) payment from a customer who was at the time under 'investigation' by the credit card company for fraud. (Obviously, this was not known to my company at the time that they accepted the payment).<p>Apparently, we even showed the credit card company that we had provided the appropriate services in exchange for the payment, so there could be no allegation of us helping them 'embezzle' the money.

It's not from Kickstarter's point of view, obviously; they get paid.  Ditto for the projects themselves.<p>The members of the public who are ""investing"" are obviously accepting risk.

But that doesn't seem to be deterring anyone, so I'm not sure it constitutes a weakness of the model either.<p>Honestly, I think the only way to interpret your point is sort of uncharitable: the people in the most danger from the kickstarter model <i>are the existing investor class</i>, who risk seeing some of their likely prospects get money from elsewhere.

Only the design patents are featured when selling a phone, by Samsung or Apple, and I'd argue the utility patents are not a selling point, even for those that try a phone before purchasing.

It's like ticking ever day on Joe's Goals to pretend you have a habit streak, or entering broccoli for every meal in MyFitnessPal - defeats the purpose. However, let's say someone is level 10 with good weapons/armor, and they're struggling under a few goals. They could just delete those goals and recreate them for a clean slate. The downside here is that they lose all their historical data on those goals (it keeps a history graph of your progress), so there's some incentive to use Re-roll instead (or to just be accountable).<p>Now, once I get some 3rd-party productivity app integration (Pivotal Tracker, MyFitnessPal, RescueTime, etc) - those goals will be static (they can't edit them), and will be updated automatically.

I'm just not quite sure what that something is.<p>What if the software as released is ""rock solid""?  That is, it's so simple, effective and reliable that it doesn't need to be changed, except for bug fixes?<p>What if the software is merely a ""platform""?  (And not only in the marketing sense of that word.)  That is, the platform only ""does one thing and does it well"", and does not generally need to be ""actively"" developed (no commits except bug fixes), but... of course people can easily build things on top of it.  For example, Ruby or Python programmers can do whatever they want.  Total freedom.  We give them the ability to create a connection to a social network they choose and they can send/receive over it to/from other members as they wish.  We do not impose rules on that or try to manage it in anyway.  We only provide the platform.  The platform is application-agnostic.<p>The ""platform"" basically stays the same.  It does what it's supposed to do, create networks, and that's all.  If we measure by number of commits, one could say the development of the ""platform"" is ""dead"".<p>tl;dr what if someone releases a _platform_ that developers can build on, but number of commits to the _platform_ remains near zero?  Because (apart from any bugs found) ""it just works.""<p>To my knowledge, Diaspora is closely intertwined with Ruby and web development.  This makes it difficult to separate the ""platform"" from lots and lots of Ruby or other scripting language programming, mainly aimed at webpages, and people changing UI stuff to their liking.  And personal preferences can vary greatly.  (And there's more to the internet than just webpages.  FB has to be webpages because it relies on the web, specifically one person's website: Zuckerberg.  Another social network (or newtork of networks) might not be so limited.) Does the dynamic, highly personalised aspect of viewing webpages have to be part of the _platform_?  Can we separate the personalisation from the basic functional element of the platform? (spawning decentralised networks)",1346096968

Furthermore, the protein products of a given gene varies by environment, ethnicity, organ, tissue, cell type, and stage of life (development, infancy, puberty, etc...).<p>If <i>that</i> weren't daunting enough, many proteins have a secondary function of regulating their own production and the production of other (somehow related) proteins.

Counting calories is a fast feedback loop (count each day, compare to your target, increase or decrease your intake as appropriate); you need a slow feedback loop to set the intermediate target against your actual goal (in this case, say, scale weight). The accuracy of the fast feedback loop isn't critical since you have a pretty accurate slow feedback loop to correct it.<p>The general approach of partitioning problem solving into fast/inaccurate and slow/accurate is very useful, since it's generally hard to make something that's simultaneously fast and accurate.<p>Note one other interesting thing about this approach: you can do unit conversions! That is, I can measure something with different units than the thing I'm trying to control.

Commercial databases of spectral signatures are expensive (thousands of dollars), and they shouldn't be.<p>Part of our problem, I think, was that we were attempting the project while taking classes full time, and working.<p>We were planning to release two different designs at different price points. One would have used inexpensive ruled transmission grating, while a more expensive unit would have used a concave holographic aberration-corrected reflective grating. The latter would have had better system efficiency, less ""smear"" across pixels, and better linearity. Each would have made use of a linear CCD array with good sensitivity (the same chip used in the Ocean Optics units). Concave gratings add a couple hundred bucks to the price, but are well worth it if you need to do UV.<p>A challenge we didn't get to solve was how to make something DIY that could be used to detect UV. It's difficult to sputter a uniform phosphor coating or remove a sensor window without specialized equipment.",1346095295

4440340,comment,4439370,4439781,5,0,JunkDNA,,,"Well there's a couple of things at work. For one, the key barrier to ""clinical demand"" is that clinicians (other than highly specialized ones) are not really prepared for dealing with genetic results. Most primary care doctors haven't thought about genetics since med school. I would also say that many of them question the utility of such data in clinical care. So I would describe the demand side as ""tepid"" except for the cases of specialities where it makes a big impact.<p>The above cultural issue is compounded by the fact that genetic testing is the only kind of test that transcends time. Your DNA sequence determined today could (and likely will) mean something different in the future as we learn more about the genome. But medicine historically has been very transactional: your doctor orders a test, the result comes back, you discuss results, make some lifestyle or treatment decisions and move on. With genetic tests, you could be ""normal"" today and tomorrow a paper lands in the New England Journal of Medicine that demonstrates with high certainty you're going to get early onset dementia or something. Well that's a problem in the current system (at least in the US). Whose job is it to go back and analyze people's genomes and update them with new info like this? Who do you bill for that? How do you notify someone? Some people don't want to know such things, can they opt out?<p>Targeted genetic testing has been used for years to identify specific diseases. But the tech to do huge swaths of the genome affordably is only a few years old. So even the diagnostic tech is still a bit ""beta"". That's the final piece limiting adoption. We're all collectively figuring out how to do this and how it fits in with existing regulatory requirements. All that ""figuring stuff out"" takes time.",1346095250

I believe RIM is most similar to Apple, but would die a slow death from hardware development costs without the volume support, so should have pivoted and merged with NOKIA while both were strong to leverage RIM's enterprise software expertise with NOKIA's hardware development/manufacturing scale.

Whether or not they were intending to, the publicity quickly took on a flavor of ""these wunderkinds are going to save us from FB!"" I couldn't say whether that was intentional or not, but the day they first released their code to the public, I read through some of it and was singularly unimpressed, and basically gave up on the project because it looked like their first Rails app, and seemed very insecure. I don't know how many developers lost confidence in them that day, but I certainly did. The punk rock ethic is great for getting things done, but some things are big projects and need to be undertaken with a degree of care and commitment, and those kinds of projects are not conducive environments for all-cylinders-firing wunderkinds.<p>I think a takeaway better model is: produce a beta or a demo that you bring to Kickstarter and ask for double or quadruple the money you think you'll need (because you will). Either make the code open-source last after it's fully developed, or make sure the code you bring to the demo is secure and unembarrassing. Even though I disagree with the idea, I think Light Table is hitting most of the notes Diaspora missed: Chris showed up with a compelling demo, raised way more money than a kid would deem necessary (and then more still with YC) and at least originally was going to make the code available last. He also updates frequently and people are using the software today, which never really seemed to happen with Diaspora.",1346094113

The mild-embarrassment condition subjects were asked to read aloud a list of sex-related words such as ""prostitute"" or ""virgin"". The severe-embarrassment condition subjects were asked to read aloud a list of highly sexual words (e.g. ""fuck"", ""cock"") and to read two vivid descriptions of sexual activity taken from contemporary novels. All subjects then listened to a recording of a discussion about ""Sexual Behavior in Animals"" which was dull and unappealing. When asked to rate the group and its members, control and mild-embarrassment groups did not differ, but the severe-embarrassment group's ratings were significantly higher. This group, whose initiation process was more difficult (embarrassment = effort), had to increase their subjective value of the discussion group to resolve the dissonance.</i><p>The cited study is:  Aronson, E., & Mills, J.

Diaspora had all the characteristics of vaporware for the longest time - I remember they were #1 in a HuffPo 'Top Ten Alternatives to Facebook' lineup in May 2010[1].<p>2. The source code released that fall seemed to fail Spolsky's second rule of being able to build in a single step, because I remember checking out the repo and then realizing that I'd need to dedicate more than ten minutes to figuring everything out, making a mental note to do that at some point,a and promptly forgetting about it entirely.<p>3. The officially-hosted version was a victim of poor timing - the first time I saw it was last summer (2011). Aside from the fact that this was more than a year after I had already seen it in a <i>mainstream</i> news source, this was immediately after the release of Google+ and at the height of the 'nymwars'. By that point, Google+ had already gained its reputation as a massive, overhyped soon-to-be-likely-failure[2]. Diaspora's UI was nearly identical to Google+, so it seemed less like an alternative to Facebook and more of an open-source alternative of an <i>alternative</i> to Facebook.<p>I don't think the technical spec of Diaspora as a product is broken at the core (though that doesn't mean that something like what you envision couldn't also be valuable as well). I <i>do</i> think that the end goal is worthwhile, and let's be clear: <i>this does not kill Diaspora</i> - it has every chance to be as much alive as Netscape is, just in a different form (ie, Mozilla/Firefox). That's the beauty of open-source projects, particularly community-driven ones.<p>[1] The lineup is of course indicative of nothing other than the fact that Diaspora was already hyped-up enough to be included in such a lineup!<p>[2] Whether or not you agree with that conclusion now, it was certainly a popular sentiment at the time.",1346094049

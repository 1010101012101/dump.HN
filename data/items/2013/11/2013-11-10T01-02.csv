6704722,comment,6704065,6704676,3,0,pdonis,,,"<i>my proposal is more explicit</i><p>One could just as easily say that your proposal is <i>less</i> explicit, because a sequence is a sequence of items, not (index, item) tuples, yet you&#x27;re making the &quot;for&quot; iteration yield tuples.<p>Similarly, a dict is a container of keys, not (key, value) pairs. The reason is that otherwise you would be unable to check to see if a key was in the dict unless you knew the value that went with it: but in that case why would you need the dict? (Technically, you could still iterate over the entire dict looking for your key, but that&#x27;s extremely slow; the whole point of having a dict is to be able to do <i>fast</i> lookups of keys in order to retrieve their values.)<p><i>Writing .items() or surrounding enumerate() does not make your code look prettier, does it?</i><p>Neither does having to extract just one item from a tuple when I don&#x27;t need the index. There&#x27;s no way around the fact that <i>one</i> of the types of iteration (either just items, or index, item tuples) is going to have to be spelled with something extra. So just saying &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t have to type something extra&quot; isn&#x27;t a sufficient argument. You need to justify why your preferred type of iteration should be the one with the shorter spelling: and since your preferred type of iteration has extra baggage attached to it, it seems perfectly legitimate to me that it should have the <i>longer</i> spelling, not the shorter one.<p><i>find the location of a specific item in the list</i><p>That&#x27;s what the &quot;index&quot; method is for.",1384048595

6704678,comment,6701688,6704430,6,0,skrishnamurthi,,,"Scala is a great language with a rich excursion into type system design (and other things). Pyret is designed to reinforce specification (more general than types) and to do so through a combination of static and dynamic means. That much I&#x27;ve already said.<p>Let me point to testing as an example of where we differ. Testing is really important to us. As you&#x27;ve seen, we have lightweight, in-place test cases. In addition:<p>1. We have a growing family of language support for writing tests well (e.g., see &quot;satisfies&quot; on the Pyret home page). I expect this to grow richer and richer.<p>2. We are working on some interesting ideas about the scope of testing blocks. We don&#x27;t say this on the home page, but you can also write &quot;test&quot; blocks for data definitions, not only for functions. But now the functions that operate over those data are going to want to use instances of the data. We&#x27;re working on a &quot;scope conduit&quot; to take definitions from the data definition to its functions.<p>3. As some readers have noted, in most languages, you simply cannot write unit tests for a function nested inside another, because you can&#x27;t even name it. In Pyret, because definitions can include tests, this creates no problem at all.<p>4. We are now working on a type-inference approach that uses tests, rather than code, to infer types. The code is then <i>checked</i> against these inferred types.<p>Essentially, testing is a kind of metaprogramming, and metaprogramming works best when you integrate it into the language (what Racket has shown) rather than as ad hoc external tools. Each of the above four examples is really just a specific instance of this general issue. Since testing is an especially important form of (dynamic) metaprogramming, integrating it well into the language from the very beginning is likely to lead to expressiveness, flexibility, and cleanliness that may be harder to achieve from the outside.<p>This is part of a more general philosophy. To me, testing is a form of _specification_, and we want to see rich descriptions of program invariants expressed with a gentle blending of static and dynamic methods. We don&#x27;t want to be so grandiose as to call Pyret a &quot;testing-oriented&quot; programming language, but in our minds it is, with testing having both the base role of making sure we (as programmers) didn&#x27;t screw up but also the exalted role of providing an alternate, independent description of the program we&#x27;re trying to write. (This is something I emphasize a lot in my teaching: eg, <a href=""http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2012/assignments/sortacle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2012/assignments/sortacle</a>, <a href=""http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2012/assignments/oracle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2012/assignments/oracle</a>).<p>This is a philosophical position, and so hard to quantify through individual bits of code, but I already see small influences of this (as above) and I expect it to guide us to a very different point in the design space over time.

Inclusivity, and thoughtfulness are nearly unarguably good things.<p>I think most reactionaries, and lesser angry white guys typically dislike the increased sensitivity that goes along with this more inclusive attitude America has today.

6704645,comment,6690126,6696231,2,0,calinet6,,,"This is like the Grand Unification Theory of Deming for me. I&#x27;ve been thinking about it for years.<p>This is a <i>classic</i> question. It doesn&#x27;t come up only in the software realmin every company, there are always high performers, and there is always resistance to the idea of treating their output as systematic, or treating them in an individual focus, rewarding and seeking them out.<p>My thoughts are that fundamentally, the relative performance of your workers is irrelevant to Deming&#x27;s prescription for quality. Your job is to improve the output of the system as a whole, and by no small coincidence, improving all your processes optimizes the company for all individual worker output the best. Continual improvement of <i>process,</i> as it applies to the product, management, and worker alike, will result in higher gains than a focus on individual performance. This is the difference of kindthe Profound Knowledge Deming talked about.<p>If you think of it like that, it&#x27;s more about human systems than it is about unleashing individual performance. Traditional management is about motivating the individual; Deming management is about recognizing that most of the output results from the system, and thus, improving the systems surrounding the individual.<p>The really fun part is how you look at performance. Firstly, you have to use statistics (after all, this is Deming we&#x27;re talking about). Recognize that the performance of a group of humans is a sample, and as in most natural distributions it will resemble a bell curve. You will <i>always</i> have outliers: mythical people who seem to outperform all others (most people focus all their attention on these). But <i>most</i> of the group will be somewhere within 2 standard deviations of the averageAKA, normal. You will always have a handful of low-performers, too. This appears to match reality in my experience at several companies, as I&#x27;m sure it does for you.<p>Now, keep in mind that Deming <i>never</i> talked about reducing variation in <i>people.</i> He talked about continual improvement, he talked about psychological effects of management on workers, he talked about enabling pride. His message was to <i>understand variation</i> in the workforce, not to abolish it. Reducing variation is the goal for the output (as it should be in software also!), but not for the employee. He never applied those numerical style goals to workers at all, and in fact decried them as inhuman, and more importantly, ineffective. See Principle #10: &quot;Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity.&quot; In other words, recognize and understand statistical variation; don&#x27;t demand a reduction in variation from individuals, improve the system to improve the output. Remember that: I&#x27;ll come back to it.<p>To your second point, that software somehow does not have a &quot;common cause&quot; consistent enough to build upon. I also want to correct this a bit. Deming&#x27;s first principle, &quot;Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive, stay in business and to provide jobs&quot; applies to absolutely all companies imaginable. This constancy of purpose is not a constancy of performance or constancy of variability, but a shared knowledge and goal that everyone strives for. It&#x27;s an abstract and unmeasurable concept. This was Deming&#x27;s only foray into &quot;common cause,&quot; though it was very important.<p>Back to the individual versus the system. Improve the system to improve the output. If ever there was a sentence to sum up Deming, that&#x27;s it.<p>Yet you think you want to &quot;unleash your 10x performers.&quot; That this is somehow the goal in Software, or in any company for that matter. <i>It&#x27;s not.</i> And here&#x27;s why.<p>Your 10x performers are your outliers: the top end of the bell curve. The instinctual reaction when you get your hands on one or two is that you&#x27;ve gotta hire more people like this, and to reward and bonus and hold them up as pinnacles of achievement. After all, they perform better than everyone, they should be rewarded. And if we reward this kind of performance, we&#x27;ll motivate other people to achieve more, right?<p>Wrong. This instinct is incorrect, and Deming based this (quite correct) conclusion on his extensive knowledge of psychology and sociology. Firstly, while you&#x27;re focusing on one or two high performers, you lose the recognition that your output and your entire company is actually systematic. You might have 50 other programmers in the body of your bell curve, the lot of whom are still collectively producing 5x what your one 10x programmer supposedly outputs, and possibly more due to complex interrelated factors. Yet, by focusing on individual performance, you unintentionally demotivate the great majority of your employees, who are almost by statistical certainty &quot;just average.&quot; The result of your efforts at improving and rewarding the performance of your 10x&#x27;er might be simply to keep them, or perhaps motivate them into being an 11x&#x27;er (big deal). You may motivate one or two people who happen to be motivated by money to improve their performance, but it probably won&#x27;t last. The main outcome will be a slew of unintentional negative consequences throughout your company, including corporate politics, ladder-climbing, blame, mistrust, fear, and demotivation. Not good. (Side note: this is Corporate America in a nutshell, the result of a century of individually focused management. We&#x27;ve become complacent about it, sadly).<p>Deming would look at this in many ways. There would be laughter and enlightenment. There <i>has</i> to be a paradigm shift.<p>First, look at the performance as a statistical anomaly. It will sometimes happen, quite by accident, that two programmers will have random variation in performance month-to-month or project-to-project. These are not unexpected occurrences. Sometimes the right state of mind aligns with the right motivation and personal circumstances to produce extraordinary performance. It has happened to all of us at times, surely. By looking at it this way, you get many realizations: that circumstances impact performance; that individual variation will occur naturally; that you might be rewarding an individual for performance which is an anomaly. This might sound like a small step, but in fact it&#x27;s the root of many cultural problems and corporate politics, mistrust of management, power games, and infighting.<p>Second, how are you measuring performance? How do you determine 10x? Deming would scoff at the very idea. His 3rd &quot;Deadly Disease&quot; was &quot;Evaluation by performance, merit rating, or annual review of performance.&quot; For similar reasons to the above, these imprecise methods cause more harm than good. They&#x27;ll cause secrecy, fear, more infighting and game playing in an effort to reach the performance or review goal, instead of the true goal: quality work. Removing these false metrics reduces fear, improves culture, improves collaboration and allows people to be prideful of their work without ulterior motives. This unmeasurable metric is more important than it sounds.<p>Third, and most importantly, Deming would surely say: ignore the outliers. Focus on improving the system. Focus on the majority of your people, and the whole of your organization to improve quality of the final product. Implement improvements system-wide, remove rewards and quotas and individual expectations and replace them with leadership, training, continual improvement, and knowledge. Deming would tell you that most of the quality of your output is not tied to individual worker performance, but rather the systems of management, technology, and collective improvement that the company has implemented.<p>The point of this is to improve your entire organization: your average 50 &quot;1x&quot; programmers might double their performance, resulting in 50x more performance than hiring one holy grail 10x programmer, or unleashing your existing one. That is a simplistic way to think about it, however. The actual improvement is much greater. By focusing on the company as a whole, and focusing on the needs and performance of all employees, you create something far greater: a cohesive culture driven by a desire to do good work as a whole, and produce quality output toward a clear purpose. <i>That</i> should be the holy grail, <i>not</i> &quot;unleashing your 10x performers.&quot;<p>Having 10x performers is surely not a bad thing; they will occur, and you should attempt to hire and keep the best employees you can, of course. But the end of this story gets even better: high performers like one thing above all else, in my experience, and that is working in an environment in which they flourish, are able to take pride in their work, and are able to work with <i>other high performers.</i> By enabling all your programmers to perform at their best, you simultaneously enable your best performers to perform better and flourish as well, which is exactly what they&#x27;re looking for. Focusing on the whole system <i>does</i> unleash your best performers; and everyone else too! It&#x27;s counter-intuitive, but that&#x27;s the lesson here.<p>The result is positive on all fronts, and not only that, but exponentially better than an individual-reward system due to the intertwined self-reinforcing effects of systematic improvements. Instead of having a handful of 10x workers, you instead build a 10x company which regularly nurtures its employees into becoming them. A 10x culture of performance.<p>This was the true genius of Deming&#x27;s perception of the workplace, and of quality.  This was never a sticking point for him; it was right there in his perspective if you look for it.<p>(Apologies for the length; I&#x27;ve been meaning to start a blog, and will sum this and other concepts up and submit to HN at some point...)",1384047233

Or what about when Britain made it a moral point to get its citizens out of Guantamo?<p>How about concepts like &quot;Police don&#x27;t need to carry guns day-to-day to do their jobs&quot;? I&#x27;ve spoken here on HN about getting out of the car during a traffic stop because I was tired of the subtle power play where the police talk down to you while you&#x27;re sitting. I had several responses, serious responses, from Americans saying that I was crazy because I was likely to be shot. Even after clarifying that I&#x27;m not being aggressive, just getting out of the car and even proactively handing over my license, they were resolute that such actions could lead to me being shot. Is this, as the author claims, the result of a population that expects their government serves them? What a citizen should expect, rather than a subject, to be so fundamentally afraid of being murdered by their own police despite having done no wrong?<p>There are things that are &#x27;civil liberties&#x27; that are not listed in the first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States. &#x27;Civil liberties&#x27; are a grab-bag of things, and the US has nowhere near a monopoly on them, and while the CCTV surveillance is bad in the UK, it&#x27;s not the be-all and end-all of &#x27;civil liberties&#x27;.<p>Similarly, counter to the article&#x27;s statement that US citizens expect their government to serve them and UK &#x27;subjects&#x27; expect to serve their government, this simplistic statement is entirely undone by the attitude towards healthcare - a fundamental part of human life, where the expectation of the individual is the opposite of the author&#x27;s statement. In healthcare, the UK citizen expects the government to serve them, the US citizen doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not just healthcare - there are plenty of fields where if something is not ideal, the UK expectation is for the government to fix it, and the US expectation is for private enterprise to fix it. Hell, even the phenomenon of <i>welfare dependence</i>, rife in some areas of the UK, comes from the expectation that the government owes the individual something.<p><i>They violate no Bill of Rights or written constitution because Britain has neither.</i><p>A British lawyer put me to rights very clearly on this point: the UK does have a constitution.

But you&#x27;ve got to be careful about your biases.<p>An interesting personal anecdote about this: I used to eat that instant Ramen stuff all the time when I was in my 20s. At some point I started getting migraines and I was able to correlate the triggering of them with eating the Ramen (lots of other things triggered them, too). That led me to investigate MSG and become a little paranoid about eating things with itI figured I might actually have some sensitivity to it.<p>Later I got diagnosed with hypertension and started taking pills to control that. And once I was on the medication I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting migraines any more. At this point I&#x27;m reasonably sure that all my migraines were caused by high blood pressure. In fact, the one or two times I&#x27;ve gotten migraine-ish headaches (nothing ever as bad as I used to get) I&#x27;ve taken my blood pressure and it was high.<p>So now I&#x27;m thinking that the MSG wasn&#x27;t causing the headaches directly, but it <i>was</i> raising my blood pressure. Or maybe it wasn&#x27;t actually the MSG doing that, since that Ramen stuff also has a ton of salt in it.<p>Anyway, our bodies are complicated machines and they&#x27;re all tuned a little different.",1384046872

1) finding hashtags with enough people desiring them so that you can order in bulk
OR
2) finding a production method that is cheap/efficient enough that you can print 1 or 2 shirts without breaking the bank<p>I wonder if you could do something like threadless did, where people vote for the &quot;best hashtag&quot; with their wallet, saying they would buy one if you produced the lot.<p>Not bad for a weekend project though!

A couple of my coworkers live up north in the suburbs, and their commute is 30 min without traffic. With traffic, it&#x27;s 1-1.5 hours. Live music everywhere though, and lots of interesting eats, like the Austin food trailers.<p>I like Atlanta mentioned elsewhere in the thread, having lived there for a number of years. Tons of cool stuff to do, and interesting concert venues like the Masquerade and Tabernacle. I lived in Midtown, but even if you don&#x27;t want to live in the city the suburbs are nice.<p>People like to make fun of Houston for being a huge sprawl with no zoning regulations, but if you want Texas with more of an Atlanta feel, you&#x27;ll get your pro sports teams, museums, and mega concert venues there. It&#x27;s still close enough to go visit Austin for a weekend (only 3ish hours). Houston and Atlanta also have the advantage over Austin in terms of airports and where you can fly direct. Going from Austin means you burn more time with connections and layovers.<p>If you move to Texas from the south though, you&#x27;re going to miss the tea. Tea here is cold and unsweetened by default. &quot;Texas sweet tea&quot; isn&#x27;t as sweet as southern style sweet tea.",1384045224

I am pretty impressed with the new Yahoo! mail). I remember that was one of the main reasons why Microsoft bought Groove.\nI agree with ekanes that you may see a few people leaves after the acquisition to start their ventures.

108936,comment,108723,108893,0,0,asdflkj,,,"I agree about the zig-zag path, but I don't think it necessarily means you should study calculus before set theory (for example). Only that you shouldn't delve too deep on your fist pass over set theory. Obviously, AOC independence proof would not be suitable for high school students. But it doesn't take much effort to understand what a function is in terms of sets. And don't they teach Venn diagrams to kids in grade school? That's already set theory.",1202099432

108925,comment,108861,108861,0,0,andreyf,,,"Oi, meddling with such definitions indeed puts us dangerously close to philosophy. As PG says in one of his essays, ""the concepts we use in everyday life are fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard"". You're pushing too hard. It's a rule of thumb, not logical truth.<p>If you insist on a logical truth, however, I think it's best to say that <i>everything else being equal</i>, a more succinct language is more powerful than a less succinct one.",1202098477
108924,comment,108723,108723,0,0,projectileboy,,,"Funny you should ask... I took a lot of math classes all through college, but at every step I was reaching beyond my grasp, so I never had great understanding. And then after a few years, I forgot it all. So in my early thirties, I started over.<p>Much more important than which text you use is your attitude, and a willingness to <i>really</i> walk through and understand the proof of a theorem, and a willingness to work through problems. Having said that, here's what I did:<p>Go through the chapter in Feynman Lectures on Physics, Volume I, where he starts with integers and goes through trigonometry until he winds up at Euler's Theorem. Do this, and you'll really understand numbers (as well as algebra and trig).<p>Then I went through the appendices of my college calculus textbook to pick up some algebra tricks I had never really learned. (This is a recurring theme, BTW: you learn a fundamental idea, and then there a bunch of tricks around the fundamental idea that enable you to actually solve problems. So, to really ""get"" math, you need to truly understand the most important fundamental ideas, <i>and</i> you need to learn some of the problem-solving tricks.)<p>From here, the school route is to press on to calculus. What's more practical is to actually learn and understand some probability and statistics. Especially Bayesian reasoning (<a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html</a>). Understanding statistics and probability will actually improve your everyday life. But assuming you still want to press on to calculus...<p>You need to learn about limits. Actually work through some limit problems. And then you need to read through the definition of a derivative, and compute some derivatives by hand, computing the limits. And then you'll really understand derivatives.<p>(By the way, when you understand derivatives, you also understand differential equations. When people take differential equations classes, they're just learning the bag of tricks used to solve different patterns of differential equations.)<p>Now read through the proof of the mean-value theorem until you get it. This will enable you to understand the fundamental theorem of calculus. And so now you understand integrals. There's a bag of tricks around solving integrals which you can learn. At this point you could also start toying around with Mathematica; you now know just enough to begin appreciating how cool it is.<p>Once here, most math courses take a little detour and teach some numerical methods. I wouldn't sweat it too much, although it's a good trick to know that you can express a lot of different functions (e.g., y = the sine of x) as algebraic series, because it lets you approximate solutions to problems).<p>Now learn about vectors and simple vector algebra, which is just enabling you to generalize your understanding to multiple variables (e.g., z = x^2 + y^2). This will introduce different flavors of derivatives, as well as some different flavors of integrals. Just go get the book ""Div, Grad, Curl and All That"". You'll need to read a different book to read and understand the theory, but reading Div, Grad, Curl will give you an intuitive feel, which can be a big hurdle to getting multivariable calculus.<p>Before, during, or after your study of ""Div, Grad, Curl..."", you might want to learn about matrices, which is a short hand for writing systems of equations that transform one vector space into another vector space. This is worth knowing if you really want to understand 3D graphics programming.<p>And now you know as much math as your average physics or engineering student, although you should learn about Fourier analysis, because it's fun, and then you'll understand how your CD player works.<p>You could quit at this point, and you'd be in pretty good shape, but everything you've done up to now falls under the heading of ""applied math"". If you want to get a taste of what most mathematicians do, you'll need to look at what's called ""abstract algebra"". This is actually a ton of fun - just think of it as a big ol' puzzle: what if you tried doing ""math"" with stuff other than numbers? The most general notion is that of a set. And then you can learn about ""groups"", which are sets with a little more structure, if you will. And then you go on to ""rings"". And then ""fields"". For all this stuff, go get Herstein's ""Topics in Algebra"". It's far and away the best text.<p>That's as far as I got. I suspect there's a ton of other fun things out there (number theory? graph and network theory?), but I don't know anything about it.",1202098116

108921,comment,108861,108861,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Stop trying to reduce the useful statement about succinctness being power into some logical rule or definition. Clearly its not a complete definition of language power, but contriving examples to break it doesn't prove an awful lot. I'm sure there exist any number of languages that are succinct but contain pathological clauses which make programming difficult.<p>I'm pretty surprised that this community is having such a problem with language succinctness being an indicator of language power.",1202097675

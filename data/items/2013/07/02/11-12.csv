5977185,comment,5975922,5976519,8,0,WickyNilliams,,,"LINQ comes in many flavours e.g. LINQ to XML, LINQ to Objects. You&#x27;re talking about LINQ to SQL. The chained function calls are equivalent to the more SQL-style LINQ, it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference and which sits better given the context. Personally I always prefer the chained methods with lambdas.<p>However don&#x27;t let the seemingly chained methods fool you! The great thing about LINQ is that is defers execution, by building an expression tree [1], meaning the code is lazily executed only when needed. And the expression tree means that everything (filtering, projection etc) is done in a single for loop [2]. e.g.<p><pre><code>    var results = collection.Select(item => item.Foo).Where(foo => foo < 3);\n</code></pre>\nThis builds an expression tree, but no work has been undertaken on our collection. When we attempt to enumerate the results, the expression tree is converted to code (again, as a single for loop, not multiple iterations as the code might seem):<p><pre><code>    results.ToList();\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s extremely cool to work with and highly expressive.

5977171,comment,5971356,5973055,1,0,cafard,,,"It varies considerably. Most public schools break have either a middle school or junior high school (grades 6-8 or 7-9) between primary and secondary grades. But most Catholic parochial schools run to 8th grade. A lot of private schools run from 6th to 12th grade on the same campus, some 3rd to 12th.<p>I suspect that the break is because in the middle years it becomes harder to find a teacher who can do everything--reading, history, math--adequately. A lot of what is called &quot;science&quot; in American primary schools I would call &quot;environmental civics&quot;--recycling is good; don&#x27;t litter.  Then in 7th or 8th grades one can actually encounter chemistry labs.<p>(On the other hand, in my 7th (8th?) grade science class a big chunk of time was given up to the evils of drugs; I didn&#x27;t particularly disagree, but bilged the class because I found it tedious to cull clippings about overdoses or LSD flashback.

They asked us to empty our pockets, patted us, searched the car and just left, no explanation, no sorry, nothing. They didn&#x27;t search the girl, I guess it&#x27;s against the law or something.

For data you want to hide, use TrueCrypt (or similar) to encrypt most of your hard-drive and set up two keys - one which unlocks the illegal data and one which unlocks the legal data.

This issue brings up significant questions about the role of a democracy and the constitutionality of its intelligence gatherings.  You can convince me that Snowden did this as a patriotic duty as an American to other Americans (&quot;Patriot Snowden&quot;).<p>However, his latest batch of releases focus on the US&#x27;s spying on enemies and our allies (bugging embassies and such).  To me, this appears to be less about informing Americans about their government than it is simply exposing the USA and harming the country.  This is common espionage that&#x27;s been practiced for decades by many countries, friend and foe.  The release of this information only appears to harm the US.

This is not due to a technical reason. This is due to the fact that Microsoft imitates Apple&#x27;s policy that prevents any browser other than Safari (+ skins) on iOS [1]. While anti-trust rulings have forbidden Microsoft from doing this on PCs, Microsoft claims that ARM-based computers are not PCs and that the anti-trust rulings therefore do not apply. I therefore suspect that Microsoft will continue with this behavior unless a court of justice decides that ARM-based computers are also PCs.

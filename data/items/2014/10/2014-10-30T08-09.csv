To save space on the wire, our patch object has single character keys, such as `s` for set, `r` for remove, etc.<p>It looks like these libraries don&#x27;t actually create patches?

In a nutshell: if you add the cost of lenses+tracking system you could buy more panels. That increased number of (passive) panels will be more reliable and will produce roughly about as much power as a non-tracking system would. The increased reliability is something very much valued in power generation, it also makes shading calculations and effects much less of a problem.<p>Depending on how expensive the ground is and what other restrictions apply you&#x27;re going to be be <i>usually</i> better off by installing a passive system.<p>I&#x27;ve built a solar system with trackers, 2x8 panels, in the end I wished I&#x27;d gone for a stationary setup, the tracking was always troublesome (you need <i>two</i> axis tracking if you&#x27;re going to utilize tracking to maximum effect, the lens system shown will definitely need two axis) and in the end produced only about 15 to 20% more power on these panels, and cost so much to set up and maintain that I could have bought another 8 panels and a rigid setup for the same money instead.",1414657888

I have often struggled to make this same point but find that many people today are so deeply committed to a worldview of scientific materialism (the objects of physics constitute all that is), positivism (everything true must have empirical evidence), and a general anti-philosophicalism, that they just cannot accept it.<p>I think it just goes to show how sick and deficient that worldview is.

Sometimes, looking through a call stack is not even helpful. Every project that I worked on had these problems. The last big bug I dealt with involved, for me, an unfamiliar codebase and about a week-and-a-half of sitting with the debugger tracing every line.<p>While for new projects, you can work very hard to ensure that firing events is hygienic, existing projects might not be so hygienic.<p>With a server-centric approach, each page load limits the mental load with state.

There is a general convention among Linux distributions to backport security fixes to the older versions of software that come with their older releases.<p>In this case, Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) was released with PHP 5.3.10 plus some security patches, available in the Ubuntu package repository under the name php5 with the composite version number 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.14. Their website doesn&#x27;t list a newer version of this package (<a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise-updates/php5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise-updates/php5</a>), so possibly they&#x27;re ahead of the official Ubuntu releases.<p>The reasoning for this is that while it might be nice to upgrade in order to get new features, new bug fixes, and new performance enhancements, these potential benefits are often outweighed by the very real cost of testing everything to make sure the upgrade doesn&#x27;t cause regressions. Backporting the security fixes makes sticking with a base version possible. I imagine that upgrading is pretty low on their list of things to do; it would have to get them some nice benefits, and nothing about php is ever nice.<p>I&#x27;m a software engineer myself, and I upgrade individual libraries far more often than I upgrade the actual programming-language runtime (or compiler), simply because that&#x27;s where you get the most benefit (usually a fix for a specific bug, but sometimes a new feature will be tempting) for the least risk.",1414656037

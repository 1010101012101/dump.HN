While others were rebuilding their systems I was working.<p>I realize Linux in 2013 is not so dangerous, but take a gander at recent java security bulletins when you get a chance anyway.  Steve Gibson recommends not even having it installed if you don&#x27;t need it (I don&#x27;t) and that&#x27;s good enough for me.<p>Also, I think you may be overselling the trade-offs.  I&#x27;ve not been inconvenienced in the last decade of avoiding java, as far as I can remember.  On occasion I will install random things into a VM for temporary experimentation.",1380088758

Some people will point out that the Surface has it, but then people will say &#x27;but Apple added this feature that makes it work&#x27;.<p>Why can&#x27;t we see it for what it is? Microsoft was the first (I think) to use an extremely very flat keyboard that doubles as a screen cover on a tablet. While not revolutionary, it is a good step forward, as good as Apple&#x27;s introduction of covers that double as a stand. Now they added something fun and playful to the range. Maybe professional musicians won&#x27;t use it, but it adds a lot of fun to the device for amateurs. And if they open up the &#x27;platform&#x27; and provide an SDK, it may lead to interesting new covers.<p>They are trying nice new things (touch covers, hybrid devices), pushing tablets in new directions. In fact, my next tablet may well be a Surface Pro, after being an iPad user before it was introduced in The Netherlands.",1380088310

These are not the public markets, where a startup has been growing for 5-10 years and largely tapped out its markets.  These are very speculative markets where the vast majority of startups end up earning nothing and the one big hit can represent a 1000x return on your investment.  Valuation at that stage is the difference between ponying up $1000 and ponying up $2000 for a seat at the table.<p>When you&#x27;re investing at $100M rather than $8M the equation changes substantially.

This meant lots of Biblical scenes for the Church, plenty of portraits, sculpture, and landscape paintings for the Aristocracy, and not much else.<p>One of the most important cultural developments in the history of cultural developments has been the emergence of artists a autonomous creators. This is what elevated their roles from those of highly skilled craftsmen to leading intellectuals, pushing the boundaries of human perception.

I totally agree that most of the time we should assume that collision resistance is the relevant figure, whether we can see the attack or not. But still, SHA-2-256 has has 256 bits of preimage resistance just like a 256 bit random oracle. But SHA-3-256 will have 128? Can we use SHA-3-256 to derive an AES-256 key?",1380087237

It&#x27;s just good UI  you almost never need to write explicit type declarations, because the compiler (or typechecker) can almost always figure out what you mean.  That&#x27;s it!<p>Using advanced Haskell extensions can occasionally require annotating a non-top-level value with a type, in order to resolve an ambiguity.  The compiler will point out which value has an ambiguous type.<p>Also, if you&#x27;ve made a mistake and your program doesn&#x27;t typecheck, depending on whether explicit type declarations have been provided or not, the compiler may complain about different parts of the program.  Adding type annotations may help pinpoint the exact location of the mistake.  This isn&#x27;t really a problem, and it&#x27;s more of an issue in SML and OCaml than Haskell, because these languages don&#x27;t encourage annotating top-level values with types.<p>There is never any need to simulate any part of the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm in your head.  The algorithm&#x27;s only failure mode is a request for more information, and the requested information should already be obvious to you, the programmer, as programming in a ML-derived language means thinking in terms of typed values.<p>The warts I had in mind were problems with the Haskell ecosystem, such as Cabal hell, or the Haskell community, such as a tendency towards academese not anything to do with its type system, or type inference mechanism.<p>In a stark contrast, Scala&#x27;s &quot;type inference&quot; is not Hindley-Milner, and is barely able to infer the existence of its own arse with both hands, failing in even the simplest of cases.<p>Example 1. Unable to infer type of `optBar`, because `None` is also a type:<p><pre><code>    scala> class Foo {
         |   def setBar(bar: Int) = optBar = Some(bar)
         |   def getBar = optBar.get
         |   var optBar = None
         | }
    <console>:8: error: type mismatch;
     found   : Some[Int]
     required: object None
             def setBar(bar: Int) = optBar = Some(bar)
                                                 ^</code></pre>
Workaround:<p><pre><code>    scala> class Foo {
         |   def setBar(bar: Int) = optBar = Some(bar)
         |   def getBar = optBar.get
         |   var optBar: Option[Int] = None
         | }
    defined class Foo
    
</code></pre>
Example 2. Unable to infer type of `foobar`, with uncurried `foo`:<p><pre><code>    scala> def foo(bar: Int, baz: Int) = bar + baz
    foo: (bar: Int, baz: Int)Int

    scala> val foobar = foo(1, _)
    <console>:8: error: missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$1) => foo(1, x$1))
           val foobar = foo(1, _)

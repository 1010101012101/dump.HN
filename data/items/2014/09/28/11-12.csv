It&#x27;s perfectly rational, it just sucks for everyone else.

It results as a voluntary exchange between a worker and a employer.  There&#x27;s no &quot;capitalistic system&quot;, unless you consider &quot;economic freedom&quot; to be a &quot;system&quot;.<p>This also shows that labor still is connected to needs, despite what the author claims.  Somebody wants something done, finds someone willing to do it for money, and they make a deal.  Nothing new under the sun, except our society is much richer in needs of various forms which might explain why the author has the feeling our &quot;pace of lives&quot; is much more intense than &quot;that of our grandparents&quot;.<p>Overall, this article is full of communist FUD :  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt</a>",1411902955

Though there can always be something better!<p>That being said, the &quot;better&quot; things I&#x27;m thinking about could be added to LuaJIT just as well as they could be to other scripting languages. For example, the LuaJIT compiler could try its best to auto-vectorize (really really hard) or could leverage the developer with SIMD-like vector operations that would adapt to whatever SSE/NEON/...-like instructions the target platform has. GCC/Clang already dod this to some extent with their vector extensions. Although for many instructions you still need to use specific intrinsics which are not cross-architecture compatible of course. The ones that are:<p>- add/subtract\n- mul/divide\n- shuffle<p>Which are already pretty important. One could argue over implementing some &quot;generic&quot; intrinsics and possibly emulating them on platforms that don&#x27;t have it. But then one could be left scratching one&#x27;s head when suddenly everything gets slow.... So I can understand the gcc/clang devs.",1392029991

Until now such services needed to be backed by an underlying financial institution since there was no way to transfer currencies safely without them.<p>Now with Bitcoin, there is an infrastructure that is free to use. Theoretically, using that infrastructure, you could create banking service outside the traditional infrastructure (messaging networks, clearing houses, settlement banks, ...)<p>However, all those institutions bring a lot more services on top of money transfer. The internet revolution was the opening of networks, rather than HTTP itself. So Financial institutions acceptance, rather than public recognition really matters if that comparison is to hold. Right now, Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are treated as a new type of asset, it is far from making any progress in the infrastructure side.<p>And of course, the elephant in the room are the regulations. The world is still recovering of the last financial crisis, the world mood is not really looking forward to less regulations. The best that can be hoped right is for Bitcoin to dodge regulations and become de-facto currency, rather than actual currency. IMO that would be a criminal-smelling loophole left there by the various regulatory institutions. Because let&#x27;s face it, even with regulation, large financial institutions like HSBC have no trouble laundering drug cartel money, so they are the one that will most benefit it, not some startup in the Valley.",1392029262

If so, then no matter what you do to cover up the other holes, that gaping one is left open.<p>Transactions are malleable. Deal with it. If a transaction is observed on the network that has the same input outpoints and the same outputs, it is the same transaction, and mtgox should treat it as such. This is a simple check to do, and trivial to automate.<p>And instead of reporting only the hash to the user, they should record, report, and track the transaction itself. You should be able to go to your withdraws and see the actual transaction, including which inputs were used, and what the change address is.

And so far, I seem to be correct in that belief. Sites like mefi, /. and fark all hit a peak than plateau or more commonly, drastically decline. I firmly believe a large part of that is due to the moderation itself. When you have the same group of minds selecting the content that gets seen, over the course of years, the users eventually get burnt out seeing the same type of stuff, chosen by the same people over and over again. The content becomes stale even if its fresh (if that makes sense).<p>There is one exception to this, however. That&#x27;s reddit. Reddit&#x27;s genius lies in its subreddits. That, in short, is the ability for users to create <i>their own</i> link aggregators within the site. In this, the content can never &#x27;get stale&#x27; because if you get bored visiting /r/Cars, and your interests are now about photography, there are a dozen different subreddits focusing on that niche. There is always something there to keep your attention. Maybe you&#x27;re a political nut, maybe you&#x27;re into botany, or even my little pony. There&#x27;s literally something for everyone. It&#x27;s a link aggregator with virtually no limits.<p>I think the biggest thing that separates reddit from all the rest, however, is that the links aren&#x27;t moderated by the admins or paid employees of the site. Each subreddit/community has its own mods who make the rules. Some communities are modded very laissez faire-ish while others like /r/askscience are modded with an iron fist. The drawback to that is it can give rise to internal drama, but I believe that&#x27;s easily offset by the limitless potential. I think reddit will eventually be spoken in the same breath as twitter and facebook a few years from now and sites like slashdot, fark and mefi will all but be gone or forgotten.",1392028539

Here&#x27;s the intro while you are waiting for it:<p><pre><code>  There is one thing which has puzzled me for a while, and \n  it is the performance of programs written in C when it \n  comes to big numbers. It may or may not help with the  \n  decades-long ‘C vs Fortran’ performance debate, but let’s \n  concentrate on one single and reasonably well-defined \n  thing – big number arithmetic in C and see if it can be \n  improved.\n\n  In fact, there are very few things which gain from being \n  rewritten in assembler (compared to C), but big number \n  arithmetic is one of them, with relatively little progress \n  in this direction over the years. Let’s take a look at \n  OpenSSL (a library which is among the most concerned about \n  big number performance: 99% of SSL connections use RSA \n  these days, and RSA_performance == Big_Number_Performance, \n  and RSA is notoriously sslloooowww).\n\n  ...\n\n  OpenSSL prefers to use assembler for big number \n  calculations. It was the case back in 1998, and it is \n  still the case now (last time I checked, the difference \n  between C and asm implementations was 2x, but it was long \n  ago, so things may have easily changed since). But why \n  should this be the case? Why with all the optimizations \n  compilers are doing now, should such a common and trivial \n  thing still need to be written in asm (which has its own \n  drawbacks – from the need to write it manually for each \n  and every platform, to sub-optimality of generic asm when  \n  it comes to pipeline optimizations – and hand-rewriting \n  asm for each new CPU -march/-mtune is not realistic)? If \n  it can perform in asm but cannot perform in C, it means \n  that all hardware support is present, but the performance \n  is lost somewhere in between C developer and generated \n  binary code; in short – the compiler cannot produce good \n  code. This article will try to perform some analysis of \n  this phenomenon.\n</code></pre>\n[1] Maybe they are using IPoAC?

However, each card you see drastically reduces the search space. My reasoning is that each card you know reduces the possible number by about how many cards it could have been (so no knowledge is 2^32, one card is 2^32 / 52 ...)<p>Knowing just one card brings you to one of 83 million possible decks. One more card and you&#x27;re down to just 1.6 million.<p>Once the flop is down, you know 5 cards and that means there are only about 15 possible decks.<p>I think this reasoning is right, but it does seem rather dramatic.

The result is that the final card is swapped only once, and can never be swapped with itself, meaning it is always somewhere else in the deck. If the final card is the ace of spades, then the ace of spades can never be the last card in the shuffled deck.<p>In most casino card games, shuffles happen before this knowledge becomes particularly useful, which is why I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily the major cause for concern here. Being able to easily guess the seed is, however, a pretty massive issue.",1392026661

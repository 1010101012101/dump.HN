For instance, a small web design shop could create content on the following topics:<p>* How to write a killer proposal
* How to close sales
* Design tips for small businesses
* Mobile strategy for small businesses
* Is Groupon worth it? 
* Web site tips 
* etc<p>Most businesses will never achieve the reach that 37 Signals has - for obvious reason. Not all of us could invent Ruby on Rails. However, I think every small business and startup can implement the strategies used by 37 signals - share everything, including your secret sauces and recipes just like chefs do, and you'll increase reach and decrease user acquisition costs.",1298148785

I've been a Computer Technician for a few years and I've had a computer my entire life, and I've been tinkering with computers in general for as long as I've had any (Kindergarten). I started programming early last year, and I audited a course at UCDavis over the summer (ECS30). I'm currently 15. I learn fairly fast with these things and I've put an enormous amount of time into this idea.<p>Last night, I finished designing the UI of the idea, and this morning I called my brother because I had a question relating to the class diagram. My brother didn't answer that question, and instead told me he had watched the Social Network last night, and it made him want to work on this with me. I had asked him awhile ago to work on it, and he said no because of school. He had about two weeks off because he had just graduated from UCDavis (with a bachelors in Computer Science and BioTech) and he agreed to work on it with me. At the end of those two weeks he decided not to work on it with me because he had just gotten a job at Autonomy.  He knows Java, C, C++, and Python. He now wants to work on it, but under a  condition. That condition being he takes care of the technology side of things, mostly because I don't know any other languages than .NET/Mono/Silverlight. This means that I'm going to have to learn Java and PHP, and as he's doing the coding for the project I'm going to be spending the time playing catch-up and as a result end up making considerably less contributions. I personally think that I have more to contribute to this project in the idea itself than he does, but he knows how to code well. I can learn to code well, it will just take more time.

That is a good resource to study and with plenty of references and sources. In fact, it had to be, because it challenges common assumptions about how propaganda and control works in US.<p>> Most people think that in a dictatorship there's one guy in charge and he directly controls the lives and actions of all the people.<p>Right after you accuse the poster of a common fallacy (appeal to authority) your proceed building a straw man. Dictatorships in most cases are sustained by military leaders, party leaders, or  an extended family network (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud</a>).<p>However I do not see how your discussion of power structure and distribution in a dictatorship applies directly to the article above.<p>> Nope, dictatorships are actually oligarchies<p>Ok, so? You can call it the ""military-industrial complex"" or ""a ruling family"", it doesn't matter. The majority of the people are controlled by a very small and powerful minority and use propaganda to effect that control better. I thought that was the point.<p>> Some highlights were comparing ""news shows"" across several different channels, 1 of which was a news show, 1 was a quasi news show, and 1 was an entertainment show. I seriously doubt such comparisons are going to lead to much value for the reader.<p>You, me and everyone here probably know that these news sources are heavily biased but I don't think the majority of Americans know. I believe that most would be willing to swear that American news agencies are free of censorship and also provide objective news. There is the party division of Fox vs MSNBC or CNN but I think most would pick one of those and identify it as a valid news source.<p>> It doesn't have to be false, involve logical fallacies, or any of that. Some of the best propaganda, as the Pentagon says itself, is simply telling people the truth about stuff they haven't heard before.<p>Yes you are applying the Lippmann & Bernays definition of it. It has acquired a negative connotation over time for a reason -- because it is usually used to mislead and lie rather then inform and educate.<p>The problem with Pentagon news is that they are not objective. The way the news are worded, and most importantly, which news are selected to be reported, and which are not, introduces a tremendous amount of bias.<p>> Then there was the over-reaching narrative of ""everything is propaganda""<p>Ok, let's apply your definition ""Propaganda = dissemination of objective information."" So everyone is interested in educated the people? Every one of those powerful entities like the government and corporations will always report the
objective truth, without spinning it, even when it ends up harming it? You really believe that?<p>> ""Easily manipulated into warlike frenzy"" and ""more controlled by propaganda than North Koreans"" (I paraphrase) are serious assertions. Assertions that you began with, then failed to offer any proof, aside from a Chomsky quote.<p>But you also fail to provide a counter-argument and don't explain how American public went from isolationism to hating Germans in such a short time? How do you explain the fact that so many Americans still claim that Saddam was involved with al-Qaeda or had weapons of mass destruction?",1298147441
2239820,comment,2235204,2238682,0,0,6ren,,,"Exactly right. Saying it another way: the market doesn't demand what ocaml offers.<p>The market demands different qualities at different times (and in any market, there will often be niches that need different qualities from the rest of the market). The ""market"" is probably best represented by paying customers, but other parties (managers, developers and users in general) also have an effect. What does the market demand at the moment?<p>It seems that at the moment, time-to-market (i.e. fast development) is most in demand. This includes being ""agile"": able to add features quickly, improve them or change them, and to debug them. This is driven by development speed, which can decrease both time-to-market and development costs (and therefore customer price). Other qualities, like performance (runtime speed) and memory usage seem less important. Reliability seems less important.<p>However, there are different parts of the market that value these differently. For example, the financial market value correctness, so it's not surprising that ocaml has found a home in janestreet. Space shuttle software also does. I would say that in desktops, quadcore, 4GB RAM performance now outstrips what many people need, resulting in the hiccup of ""netbooks"", and finally the smartphones - much less powerful, but customers are willing to buy them because they offer convenience.
Within smartphones, performance of <i>software</i> became important again, because within the category (given convenience) the hardware hasn't yet outstripped demand for it.<p>Another example is in MS Windows, when it first got an adequate GUI interface in windows 95, people bought it in droves even though it was buggy and unreliable. Then, combining it with NT in Windows XP, it became reliable, and people bought that. Then, security was the issue, and that got fixed. It may seem a little surprising that Windows 7 is popular, but one thing is that all those books and sites about ""windows annoyances"" mean that there's room for windows to improve... which means they can sell another version. If it no one complained because it was perfect, that would be bad news for microsoft. (of course, their run may be over now, if smartphones replace the desktop, and they can't win that market away from apple).<p>Now, just because development speed has been important for a while doesn't mean it always will be. Reliability and performance may become more important again, especially in niche markets. And it is there that ocaml may have an opportunity.<p>But meanwhile, although ocaml is amazing in that it has the expressiveness of functional programming, the correctness of strong typing, and the performance of C, it is a double straightjacket language: first it has to be functional (though you can mutate, it's not as nice); then it has to be strongly typed. You can't just code it they way you think about it. You have to adapt yourself to the machine. (note: this is based on my personal experience with ocaml).<p><i>tl;dr</i>
OCaml has many benefits, which I don't question. What I am saying is that the <i>mainstream</i> market doesn't <i>currently</i> value those particular benefits of ocaml over other attributes.",1298147394

Always carry a book with you and never leave the house without one. Read outside, read in the bathroom, read at lunch. Read on transit, airplanes, wherever. I've always behaved like this.<p>If you're interested in developing your own regime, I recommend you practice reading after disengaging from the day and before sleeping. For the past twenty years I've averaged 60 pages a night by getting into bed and reading until sleep arrives. When a section of a book is more compelling than sleep, I'll get out of bed (in a wonderfully quiet house), make a cup of tea and read for another hour.<p>Reading is completely my time, regardless of what city I am in, hotel or home and it is a habit I have preserved on 100 hour work weeks and vacation alike.<p>I also avoid ordering books on Amazon, since I know my local booksellers and want to continue seeing them in operation. :)",1298146361

You start with all these dreams of a bright future, and one day you find yourself facing the stark reality that it just didn't work out, that there's nothing you can do anymore to change that, and that basically the last X years of your life, where you sacrificed anything, were pretty much for nothing. ""Well, at least I learned a lot!"" is very little consolation in that context.<p>It's a pretty fucking tough time to go through, burying your startup. I've been there, and hell, I'll probably get there again some day, but it's not the kind of thing that you go through without after-effects.<p>As a startup employee, you're a bit like that neighbour who watches the previously happy couple tear each other apart and finally divorce. My, ain't it tough for them, geez, I hope it never happens to me.<p>As the founder, you're right in the middle, ripping your dreams to bits.<p>And the best part is, after all that, people still expect you to pick yourself up and do it all again!<p>Edit: I suppose I'm being a bit melodramatic here, as pointed out by the two responses. That said, I do think that shutting down your failed startup that you poured your dreams into is a deeply demoralising experience.

I don't know enough about it to know if they're the people I should be donating to. Forks are complicated that way. I'm a little suspicious of them needing 50k right off the bat like this, but it's been a long time since I've followed development or the people involved very closely. It's such a huge project, it probably <i>does</i> need a reasonably large and funded organization to really push it forward, and I obviously wouldn't trust Oracle to do it.<p>We are, however, probably reaching the end of life for desktop-based office suites. I use Google docs for writing everything except books at this point, and I've considered trying it for a collaborative book, as well.

I strongly suggest using an existing framework like three.js as a starting point and going from there. Three.js is complete enough that a basic scene can be created quickly and extensible enough that complex scenes and shading can be created by extending it with custom objects.<p>For example, I was working on creating a WebGL setup for playing around with the Oculus Rift and used three.js to create <a href=""http://sxp.me/rift/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sxp.me/rift/</a>.

My main issue with the TSA, besides the fact they violate my rights, is they are a non-solution to a non-issue. The fact is, TSA screening is a joke, and TSA screeners are largely incompetent. Furthermore, if a terrorist wanted to kill hundreds of Americans, they need only set off a bomb in the main terminal entrance, before screening takes place. Locking the cockpit doors and having more aware passengers are what keeps us safer from hijackers than before 9/11.<p>I wish airlines had a choice to use the TSA or not, because then we could vote with our wallets. But no, we are being forced to be groped by imbeciles who think that patting down frightened five year olds is worth it. While the finer points of your analysis are correct, the most compelling argument against the TSA lies outside the scope of your analysis. The idea that you can have absolute safety is a farce. Whenever we want more safety, we have to ask ourselves at what cost it's worth that safety. The TSA is a political response to an anomaly, and somewhere along the line we forgot that we are giving up our freedom by chasing ghosts.",1362948946

Whatever else you think of me, don't just assume I'm inconsistent.<p>Now you're saying that racism is ""not the same"" (I'm assuming that means ""not bad""?) if it's in favor of people who are normally discriminated against by the ""dominant"" culture. It amounts to justifying one person's bad behavior by pointing out someone else's, which simply doesn't qualify as a moral argument. If this is the only reason BET is okay and WET is not, I think it's a lame one.<p>In the case of television networks, it doesn't really matter. But I refuse to accept this mushy ""different contexts"" argument to justify anyone's wrong or stupid behavior. The whole point of striving for equality is to get rid of these different contexts, not perpetuate them. Be the change you want to see.<p>There is a certain sense in which BET may be less stupid than WET, which is if being black was a strong selector for liking some content over others. This is, AFAICT, less the case with ""white"" people, so WET makes less sense. This kind of goes back to what I was saying earlier about girls' CS events because, hey, the girls want to get together and hack. They can do their own thing if they want.

Thanks for clearing that one up!<p>""An attack looks like it will take so much effort that the terrorist is no longer interested (terrorists are lazy, too) or capable""<p>Except that you can buy or obtain all the things needed to kill people on an airplane on the other side of the security check. You can buy glass, you can get knives from restaurants, etc.  The fact that you get a security check long before you are anywhere near an airplane leaves a lot of room for an attacker, even a solo terrorist who is not particularly creative.<p>Note that the Israeli approach involves walking <i>up to the door of an airplane</i> without any carry-ons or shoes.  Profiling is needed to determine who is even worth the attention (if they did that to everyone, there would be riots).  Meanwhile, the TSA will let you bring a pocket knife onto a plane, which is more than enough to kill people.<p>The real difference today is not that terrorists have a harder time bringing weapons onto planes, but that passengers and crew do not believe they will survive a hijacking.  People will now fight back.  The locked cockpit doors -- locked from the inside -- help a lot too.  Any security beyond explosives detection is pointless, and you could have that sort of security right at the departure gates.<p>I personally doubt that the TSA checkpoints were ever meant to keep us secure.  The Bush administration just needed to reassure people that we would have better security than we did beforehand, in a visible and easy-to-understand way.  Now the agency is huge and no politician can afford to void against checkpoints, just in case a clever terrorist manages to hijack a plane (or perhaps shoot it down with a surface-to-air missile; people would probably blame lax airport security in that case too).  It also helps that so many contracts are awarded for building the TSA's equipment, and that the TSA has substantially weakened Americans' ideas about civil rights (and what mainstream politician will complain about such things?).",1362948696

[1]There was no guarantee they would be able to sell the domains that they registered. If there was they would have registered more than they did. Later once the top names were grabbed others took advantage and actually spent real money to buy them with the hopes of reselling (say buying something for $50,000 and hoping to wait a number of years and sell it for $300,000). Some of those people have made money and some are still sitting on those domains.<p>[1] And of course prior to that domains were free but they actually vetted the applications so there was somewhat of a constraint on what you could register. Additionally the utility wasn't as obvious as it was even a year or two later when Network Solutions (the sole bidder on the contract) asked to be able to charge because of the amount of domains registered exceeded the original intent (or whatever) of the contract.",1362948624

Hijackings are not really feasible anymore].  For that purpose, it does not have to be 100% effective, or even 95% effective, or even 90% effective; it just has to raise the apparent level of difficulty high enough such that:<p>a) An attack looks like it will take so much effort that the terrorist is no longer interested (terrorists are lazy, too) or capable.  Attack frequency is inversely proportional to effort involved.  If all a terrorist had to do to down a plane is click on a link in a web-browser, we would see catastrophes daily; if the sophistication of the attack is such that it takes months of training, the frequency drops by orders and orders of magnitude.<p>b) It forces a terrorist to get help from other terrorists; while a solo terrorist is hard to detect in advance, terrorist networks and their communications are routinely infiltrated by law enforcement and intelligence.<p>In this respect, pat-downs and body scanners force terrorists to up their game, which, in turn, discourages attacks from ever taking place.

You can invest more in certain areas and yield a return on that investment, but you can't reliably call your shots.  Life doesn't work that way.<p>Nearly all of the fruits of government research have been as a result of ""stochastic"" investment (i.e. nearly everything done by the NIH and NSF and DARPA), or second-order effects from ""deterministic"" investment (e.g. the space program and velcro, or radar and military spending).  Other than wars and (maybe, debatably) the space program, we have a pretty spotty record of saying <i>""we're going to do $X amazing technological feat in $Y years""</i>, and then making that happen.<p>Where we <i>have</i> successfully called our shots (and I'm thinking mainly of the space program here), it's only happened after decades of stochastic progress got us to the point where a politician could reasonably say <i>""let's go to the moon""</i> without sounding like a lunatic, and have some realistic hope that it would happen during a four-year term.  Politics, as a societal force, is not particularly forward-thinking.<p>If you're looking for something governmental to blame for lack of innovation, you don't need to assign the entire political system a mindset, or compose elaborate pseudo-philosophical lectures:  you need only look at the number of science PhDs who can't work in their fields, or the declining number of smart kids who go into research.

Some guys who do serious vinyl rips spare no expense, using pristine vinyl on high-end rigs, washing the disk before the first play, etc..

I am using a low-end $60 Sony head-set and all audio from my PC competes with background clicks and chirps from my built-in audio jack due to bad poor grounding in the motherboard (I assume).<p>I can think of 3 reasons the vinyl rip sounded better to me: 1) It is, in fact, a better sound; 2) The master used to produce the vinyl source was better than the one used for the CD I have; or 3) It's all in my head.<p>I mostly ruled out #3 because I snagged a few more 24-bit vinyl rips to see if they were any better then my CD sources, but I deleted them due to poor sound.<p>That all said, regardless of the technical details, I am quite fond of my new 24-bit 96KHz copy of ""The Boxer"".

Audrey Roy is the other one, I'm just the one who spends more time on Twitter, HN, and blogging.<p>In any case, thank you for this mini-review. We can't make the book better without feedback, including negative commentary. So far most of what we've gotten back has been extremely positive. While gratifying to our egos, it's the brutally honest critical reviews like yours that have given us the best information for improving the book. In fact, we ask for honesty in reviews of our work, and are willing to take soul-crushing criticism so we can improve it.<p>As for the existing reviews, with the possible exception of Barry Morrison, they were not written by our friends. We didn't know any one besides Barry who wrote them, and his private feedback to us as a technical reviewer was pretty negative in places.<p>I find your point about not enough justification for our practices very interesting. We talked to a lot of core/senior Django developers about them, but I think you might have a good point that we need to explain the background. I thought we addressed this in the Beta release, and I would like to hear your feelings about that version.<p>Some more points:<p>The chapters seem tiny because we self-published and there is no fluff. This time I didn't have a publisher telling us, ""This chapter needs 20 pages of content, add some more content!"". This happens to book authors working with mainstream publishers, which is why tech books are often so thick and heavy and sit mostly unread on shelves. Instead, because we controlled the book 100% each chapter is as long as the material needs to be. Hence your feeling that this is 'light-reading', even though it has as much content and code examples as a thicker, denser book.<p>What do you consider substantial with Django? Should I have built Disqus, Mozilla, Pinterest, or Instagram on my own? Or is there some other level of work that I should have done?  I'm curious, because unlike some people I don't hide behind a pseudonym (I'm Daniel Greenfeld and it's easy to find information about me). Unfortunately a lot of the work I've done for the past 18 months is in private github accounts. This really sucks, and I hope to fix it this year.<p>As for my actual Python and Django skills, I'm humble enough to acknowledge that I can always learn more. This is part of why I worked so hard on the Django CBV documentation refactor in 2012 (especially the reference docs), to expand my own knowledge of them. The day I call myself the absolute authority is the day I stop improving, and I apply this to everything I do. In fact, I used to give a talk on this exact topic. ;-)<p>Finally, as for the free chapter, here goes: Since the book was released in Alpha and Beta states, we want our book in a perfect state. This is why we offered the book at a discount (O'Reilly and other mainstream publishers do the same), so early adopters could try it out and provide feedback and we could get paid for our hundreds of hours of work. In return for the early adopter discount, you and many others have given us useful feedback (not enough justification for our practices), and now we can improve.",1362946693

In response the owner of the copyrighted data could show that through a series of transformations the data is the copyrighted data. That being said, can't any data be ""transformed"" to be that same copyrighted file?<p>Thanks for reading and looking forward to some feedback!",1362946027

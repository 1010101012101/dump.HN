I know abused kids are a serious issue, but the vast majority of kids aren't abused, and this is a disturbing ad to show specifically to a kid, especially when the grown-up with them doesn't see it.<p>I'm picturing walking past this billboard with my kid and having him ask ""Daddy, why does that kid look all beat up"" and answering ""no, that kid looks perfectly normal, you're making it up"". Nice.<p>There are far better ways to have a very high-quality 2-way covert channel to any kid old enough to read an ad and act on the information here, namely: school. Many teachers are extremely pro-active about figuring out signs of abuse. My mother was a teacher and intervened decisively and successfully in a serious ongoing physical abuse situation once.<p>Plus, the idea that you might care about kids at school and find out what's up with them is a good precedent that can lead to a lot of other nice related things even when there isn't abuse. On the other hand, lenticular ads that show different things to adults and kids is not a good precedent, whether it's used to show grosser ads to grownups than we currently have to see already (""hey, the kids can't see this"") or to covertly market to kids.",1367798289

An argument from authority is fallacious if, and only if, the authority cited is not an unbiased expert in the matter <i>or</i> there is no expert consensus on the matter. Trusting your doctor when you are sick is not an instance of fallacious reasoning.<p>While I'm here, another problem with things like this is the tendency for people to use them as an argument-refuter-o-matic.

<a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property</a><p>The tl;dr:  Represent a piece of property, say a stock certificate, as a small value of bitcoin.  By transferring the bitcoin to another user, you are transferring the ownership of the property.  This can be useful for creating distributed markets where property can be traded for bitcoins without requiring a trusted intermediary.<p>I don't understand why this is such a big deal for the developers.  You see a lot of panic about UTXO bloat.  It seems to me this can be solved by making the UTXO cache a bit smarter.  If you have a very small value output that has not been used in a while, store it on the harddrive, not in RAM.  If the output shows up in a new transaction, you will have a cache miss, but that doesn't seem like a serious issue.  If the client is smart property aware, store those dusty-looking outputs in a seperate cache.<p>This might be an attack vector for DDOS attacks, but that should be solvable by throttling the processing of transactions that miss the cache.<p>The propogation of transactions that are not in the RAM cache might be a bit longer, but that is the price you pay for making a transaction with dust.",1367798129

5660263,comment,5659344,5659614,2,0,wisty,,,"Also, China was an ally. Some of the worst stuff happened under the old Republic - they pretty much had a policy of genocide against Tibetans in Sichuan. I don't remember if it was actually the KMT (or some of the warlords who allied them), but they were quite brutal. Then the KMT fled to Taiwan, and the CCP became the ""bad"" guys.<p>While the CCP has a mixed history, they do relax the One Child Policy for ethnic minorities (I think Tibetans are allowed 2 children), so it's hard to suggest they are actually genocidal. Nationalistic, yes, but that nationalism recognises the rights of minorities (as long as they don't try to rebel). They did a lot of dodgy stuff in the Cultural Revolution, but it's not like they are given a free pass on that.<p>I'm not sure about the Great Leap Forward, but that was more an outrageously stupid policy decision than a deliberate crime. It only lasted 3 years. While Mao <i>should</i> have ended it sooner, it's not like he kept it going for 10 years, like the Cultural Revolution. Perhaps it really took 3 years to weed through the false reports of progress, and to realise it wasn't just growing pains, sabotage, or natural disasters.

More like guidelines.<p>In the real world, where you don't have all the information at hand, and you have trust levels and possibilities and resource limits, a ""logical fallacy"" can be more beneficial (statistically) than not.<p>Case in point: ""appeal to authority"". If I'm sick, I'd rather trust my doctor, than a non-doctor guy, just for the fact that the doctor has a MD and he does not. I don't have time to study medicine and examine both approaches (e.g I could be bleeding to death).

It's just a guideline too. Sometimes the MORE complex story, with the more entities involved in it, is the one that actually happened. E.g in police cases. There is often a clean-cut explanation that might seem obvious but is wrong, and a more involved story that is what actually happened. Lots of innocent have fell prey to the ""obvious"" and ""simple"" explanation, only to be proven innocent many years later.<p>Think of the movie ""Arlington Road"".

It seems to me that things like this are about as based on the HGP data as velco is to NASA.

5658943,comment,5658159,5658159,3,0,PaperclipTaken,,,"There are a few challenges facing Bitcoin, and I think that in the long run Bitcoin will not be the chosen digital currency of the world.<p>The first problem is that there is a highly predictable and (at the moment) constant supply of bitcoins, which means that the value of the coin will adjust like a commodity as more or less people start to use it. It's like Gold or Oil in the sense that when people want it, it's worth a lot, and when people don't want it, it's not as expensive. That chains the value to the demand, meaning that any time you use bitcoin as a store-of-value, you are putting yourself at the complete mercy of the market.<p>Many advocates believe that as the number of people using bitcoin grows the price will stabilize, but I think that using bitcoin as a store-of-value is going to end up like using the gold standard, especially because some early adopters have tens of thousands to even a million (Satoshi is believed to have a million) bitcoins, and any of them could decide to 'cash out', which would dramatically change the supply and potentially affect the whole market.<p>Another problem is that the currency is highly traceable, and while you can do things to obfuscate your spending habits there are lots of techniques involving statistical analysis that shed doubt on the effectiveness of obfuscation. You can take this back to the ""I have nothing to hide"" argument, but there are plenty of powerful parties that will be more interested in a currency that can't be traced (imagine big business or big finance), and an untraceable currency would certainly be more attractive.<p>But to me the biggest current problem with bitcoin is the uncertainty. There are many conflicting schools of thought in economics each with their own reasons why bitcoin is good or bad. But beyond the basics, macroeconomics often involves a lot of voodoo, and for any new paradigm there will be major schools of thought that will believe the new paradigm is bad or unstable in some way. There is no real way to fight this except to accept that we ultimately have no idea how new economic paradigms will affect our world, and that some of the naysayers may be correct and thus caution should be used.",1367772702

It is more about the problem, your style and your teams programming background.<p>As a long time Ruby developer who's always in search of faster, better, cheaper I've found the following:<p>- Rails is still the safe, moderately fast to develop in do-anything framework.  It excels at CRUD and will have a maintained library available for pretty much anything you need to do.  It however is relatively slow and Ruby comparatively sucks at anything async.<p>- Node and its supporting frameworks are fantastic at async and smaller single page type web apps.   But it's a bit trickier than Rails or similar to structure and manage larger code bases.   NPM is awesome for web development, better than Gems.  Packages in general are not as mature as Ruby Gems and will be some time until they are.  ORMs are quite weak compared to what you have in Rails (see Mongoose vs Mongoid).<p>My current stack of choice is Rails+Bootstrap for CRUD, Node+Restify for APIs (or Express if you need to throw in a little HTML as well), MongoDB for the DB, Redis for caching/pubsub/jobs.  I'd use Postgres instead of MongoDB if I had an application where data integrity is paramount above all.

But plenty companies have gone bankrupt through bad financial management. I think in the Netherlands some insurance companies might have gone bankrupt if our government allowed them to (because many insurance companies in the Netherlands are linked with banking companies). But instead our government thought it wiser to spend taxpayers money to keep these companies alive.<p>> The incentive to ""not waste money"" in the health insurance industry is ""deny coverage when possible"". Is that really the best way to provide healthcare for all Americans? Presumably that's the real goal that we all share, and we're just arguing about the best way to do it.<p>I think this is a prime example where government legislation should provide consumer security that insurance companies keep to their end of the contract.<p>> If government-provided health insurance is too wasteful, why does the American federal government spend more money on healthcare than most other countries (not even counting the American private healthcare expenses), with worse outcomes?<p>Of course the cause might be in many areas, I'm not sure the US example compared to many other countries is proof that government supplied social healthcare is always cheaper.<p>Then again, even F.A. Hayek argues in his book ""The Road to Serfdom"" that perhaps in very few situations government supplied services might be worth the loss in freedom [1]. Perhaps healthcare could be one of these services.<p>[1]: ""In instances like these it is at least possible that we might all be better off, and should prefer the new situation if we had the choice-but that no individual ever gets the choice, because the alternative is that either we should all use the same cheap car (or all should use only electricity), or that we should have the choice between these things with each of them at a much higher price. I do not know whether this is true in either of the instances given. But it must be admitted that it is possible that by compulsory standardisation or the prohibition of variety beyond a certain degree, abundance might be increased in some fields more than sufficiently to compensate for the restriction of the choice of the consumer.""",1367772143

Healthcare/health insurance, for a number of reasons, is one place where government-provided solutions have traditionally been less wasteful than private market solutions.<p>One reason is that single-payer systems are monopsonies: The single payer (which need not be the government, and in some countries actually isn't the government) has much greater bargaining power than any individual or company and can negotiate better prices.<p>Second, the big cost drivers for health insurances are things that happen either way; the 80/20 rule applies, and most actual costs are caused by chronic illnesses, surgery, etc. These costs will occur either way and will have to be paid for. They will eventually come out of your paycheck (or somebody's paycheck), no matter who's being charged and how. There's no taxing people more or less, because most of the costs are fixed. Single-payer systems allow us to structure payment for these costs to minimize inefficiencies, medical debts, etc.; universal healthcare furthermore reduces the risk of treatment for acute conditions being delayed, which drives costs up further.<p>Third, healthcare/health insurance markets are less efficient than other markets. One reason is that people do not have a desire to shop around when getting sick; evaluating healthcare options takes time, and that's the last thing you have when you need treatment. Another reason is that healthcare and health insurance is simply too complex and time-consuming for patients to fully understand and to appreciate, especially with the arcane complexity of health plans as they tend to develop in a free market. Finally, insurers in a free market will do their darnedest to insure healthy people and avoid insuring sick people.  All of this breaks the normal demand and supply constraints in a fairly fundamental fashion.<p>Health insurance in the Netherlands may be becoming more expensive, but that's because health insurance is becoming more expensive <i>everywhere</i> as a consequence of population aging and advanced treatment options. In the end, your per capita health care expenditures are still 2/3 of that of the United States. Under the US system, you could expect to pay a couple thousand Euro more annually.",1367771296

Even then, in the most extreme of scenarios, it runs out.<p>After the point of maximum damage, job losses will revert to close to nil by default. The side the author is claiming as recovery, is not recovery but rather it's continued job losses in fact (at a gradually lessening rate). So it's remarkable to see it used as an indication of recovery, when it doesn't inherently indicate any sort of thing. A chart with an arrow pointing up does not mean recovery.<p>If you took a look at the Spanish economy right now, which suffers from intense 27% unemployment, you could run a similar chart on their unemployment. For it's a mathematical requirement that eventually the job losses must slow to a trickle, and at that point some idiot economist could claim that as a proof of recovery via a similar chart with a fun arrow pointing up to lessened job losses. Noone would confuse 27% unemployment, in which there are low job losses, as a proof of recovery - context matters.<p>In the same vein, producing 100k jobs per month on average is no proof of stagnation just because the average is flat.

The inflation disaster the Fed gave us over those 40 years, is continuing today, and is approximately a million times larger a financial issue than Obamacare. If you wanted to look for the reason for the destruction of below middle class paying jobs in America (most service jobs), that'd be the first place to start (the impossibility of keeping up with just 3% to 5% perpetual inflation).<p>A real discussion on all of this would require detailed information on the types of jobs being created, the number of hours those workers were getting, the portion of those that are 2nd or 3rd jobs, and so on.

In fairness, the gentleman interviewed in this article insisted it was all an experiment.  But the WSJ editorial board has a long time habit of being very non-mainstream and almost Austrian with its economic views, so this interview was likely intended to play into a political narrative.<p>Here is a summary of what he is trying to say:<p>1.  Bringing up hyperinflation in Zimbabwe is a common tactic of right-wing/Austrian economists to warn of the evils of government control over fiscal spending and currency, and that our current course of monetary expansion means that we in the US too are on the same path.<p>This ignores of course that (a) Zimbabwe had a civil war at the time and the government confiscated or destoyed most private productive capacity; (b) we are in a liquidity trap currently, which in short means that money is nearly free to borrow at 0% interest.  Companies are sitting on piles of cash or continuing to unwind their debt from the 2008 crisis, therefore we have not enough people spending.  Printing money has had no discernible impact on inflation over the past 5 years.  In fact, we could use a bit right now - to encourage spending!<p>2.  The thought that ""encouraging saving is good"" therefore fixed currency and deflation is good.<p>An economy is a closed system - if some are saving, others have to spend to keep the music going.  If we all stop spending, we get into a depression, where people lose their jobs, and the economy isn't working to its potential - all because the currency is rising in value.<p>In short, it is arguable the point of an economic system is to make and consume goods and services, not sit and watch your bank balance grow due to the psychological whims of the market.<p>3.  A currency based in faith is not a dangerous thing - basing currency on gold is mostly a form of superstition.  and it has real drawbacks (see #2).<p>Lots of things in the world are based on faith in institutions or theorems.  Bitcoin is too - faith in the algorithm, that it works and won't be compromised.  Also (blind) faith that a fixed amount of Bitcoin will not lead to destabilization.<p>Now.  Does that help?

The driving reason for this is so apps can be wrapped to be like native apps, and have a level of state and data persistence. The trend in modern web apps is to send a lot of data down as JSON, and only do serverside rendering in cases where you need SEO or incredible rendering speed.<p>You make a choice between angular, ember, bootstrap+handlebars, roll your own, or a few others. On the back-end, there is a similar array of very reasonable non-real-time frameworks, mostly centered around Python (Django, Flask, etc.), Ruby on Rails, or the newish and sexy and real-timish node.js. Go is apparently pretty popular on HN, and imagine it's not the same academic trap that Haskell is, but I've never touched the stuff.

My high level bullet points are:\n1) It's insane that any business should spend so many cycles on managing this. I would have thought Republicans (pro business) might be more open to a state role in healthcare precisely so business's don't have to manage this burden. \n2) Somebody who is 35 or 40 with children fully burdened is around $1200 a month or $14,000 per year. Someone who is 25 and single is $200. You think that differential never goes through our minds when assessing candidate and how much we'll pay them? That totally sucks but is a reality. \n3) The wealthiest and most likely to vote Americans get their health insurance via their company. So they're entirely immune to the dysfunctional system. If ALL Americans were procuring health insurance in the private marketplace there'd be a much better system. Much less abuse. If the government (like EU/AUS) was the sole customer there would be a much better system. It's this mixture of employers, too small in aggregate to manage the demand side, + smaller individuals buying it on their own, that drives the spiraling costs here. \n4) Having a startup provide your health insurance is really dumb. Startups have a much higher % chance of closing their doors. So one day you get laid off because your startup doesn't make it. Guess what, now you have to go and find a new job AND work out what you're COBRA options are. In the broader context, most people who get laid off in the US lose their job AND now have a $1000 or more (if they're family provider) costs layered on as they now have to start paying for healthcare. Like losing a war you didn't start then being forced to pay repatriation costs when your economy is at its weakest.<p>Politically, I think we're more likely to get universal healthcare via the state through than to ever get all employers to stop offering it and put everyone into the marketplace. So I support these efforts because the current blend is the worst.<p>(PS right now we're paying full costs because we lean toward hiring more mature people (read families) who understand what it would cost them in the marketplace to get it so they can balance it against their overall lowered financial compensation.)",1367770052

Surely at some point, even the right-wings have to appreciate that neither closed markets nor putting peoples lives put in danger because of the greed of the few is neither in the spirit of capitalism nor the Christian thing to do (and I only reference the last part because of the emphasis that many right-wings place on religion).",1367769831

One was on sexual harassment- I'll save that for another thread.  The other was a cultural awareness 'sharing.'  For context, this was around the time of the Anita Hill testimony regarding Clarence Thomas<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Hill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Hill</a><p>and the Tianaman Square protest<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_19...</a><p>So sexual harassment and multicultural diversity were on the country's mind.<p>The department had a cultural awareness discussion centered on an exchange between the American graduate students and the recently arrived Chinese graduate students.<p>To my astonishment, the Chinese saw us American students as unfriendly, always retreating and 'sticking to our own kind.'  They found it very hard to connect with us, much as they wanted to.  It was because of the way we worked.  When American students got their homework or assignment, we went to our desk and worked on it.  We did the readings alone, we turned in the problems that we worked alone, and had very little discussion about the matter.  We approached the courses individually, and this put the Chinese students off.<p>It put them off because they were very much about <i>community</i>.  They discussed the lectures and reading until <i>every single one of them</i> understood it.  They lived and died together.  If homework was supposed to be individual work, then they did it individually- but they collaborated heavily on everything up until the point of homework- and they made sure everybody knew the concepts, math, etc. for doing the homework.<p>This is a very efficient way of learning new material.  In fact, I've read in TIMS studies (or, books about the studies like 'The Teaching Gap' and 'The Learning Gap') that this is the asian way of teaching and learning in lower grades as well.  There was less of an emphasis on (or, perhaps better, less of a <i>recognition</i> of) individual talent as being the basis of success in school, and more of a culture of ""we can all get this together, if you can't it's because you are unwilling to work.""<p>So I am not at all surprised that you observed heavy collaboration- I would be disappointed, however, if you saw deliberate 'cheating.'  I can sympathise that people who don't fathom the concept of individuality in learning may struggle to understand the line between what we accept as cheating and not cheating.  But that is not to say that they don't, and cheat anyway.",1367769619

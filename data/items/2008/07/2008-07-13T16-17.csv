245198,comment,245110,245110,0,0,akeefer,,,"Metaprogramming is a sharp, sharp tool that many people are liable to cut themselves with - it does lead to hard-to-understand and hard-to-debug code, so you have to make sure the tradeoff is worth it.  As with any such tool, you just need to use it with restraint.<p>I've personally come to the conclusion that without metaprogramming you really can't write decent frameworks; even Java frameworks tend to use reflection and even run-time code generation, and I think the lack of more capable metaprogramming abilities in Java is one reason frameworks in Ruby, Python, etc. are more user-friendly.  Frameworks are crucial these days, so I think metaprogramming is also essential to a language.  It's just something that ideally would be used only in cases, like frameworks, where only a few people have to actually understand and debug it and a large number of people can leverage that work.",1215967738

It was pretty cool, and would have been difficult to accomplish with anything but Linux (infact, it replaced a windows system that never worked very well).

Structures which work well for creating Java code probably won't work well for creating JavaScript or Ruby code. A couple of things come to mind:<p>1) Code reviews are a lot more important for languages which allow 'meta-programming'<p>2) Thorough, but concise documentation, also.<p>Extending Class.inherited() (as quoted in the linked article) without telling anyone or documenting it is a social problem of process and organization, not one with the programming language.",1215965892

You're pretty much just paying for the delivery medium.<p>On the Internet, the cost of the delivery (bandwidth and server costs) is too low on a per user basis to bother charging, so it's ""free"" but the paper is free to make money the same it does with regular newspapers - advertising.<p>If anything kills the concept of newspapers, whether online or not, it'd be the self-righteous jerks who run ad blockers.

245178,comment,245071,245148,0,0,herorev,,,"I don't think it will matter much if all the big media outlets become saturated to a much larger degree with bias, because consumers are no longer at the whims of ""pinko media owners"".<p>In the past, if all the physical newspapers sold if your area had a strong bias (that went against yours), you didn't have many options. But on the internet you can easily switch to a different news source. If all the big players just start pumping out far-left propaganda, consumers can and will go elsewhere very easily.<p>Differing opinions are more easily accessible thanks to the internet, but the internet also allows people to more easily isolate themselves from differing opinions. In a decade, people may be intentionally consuming news from sources that are tailored to their bias. It'll be easier to hide away from news sources that express ideas you disagree with.",1215965434

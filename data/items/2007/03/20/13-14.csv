Is it sticky enough to have me glued in day in and day out?  I give it 3 months before it taps out.  I mean its no trueman show here folks and ya don't even empower folks along the way.  Why not tell  people how ya did it?  Share some real insight.    How exactally am I living through their lives.. by watching them sleep?  I did that sleep study last month, it wasnt that fun really.  This is basically a short term startup biz idea, take 4 guys that do stuff, slap cameras on them, watch them make more stuff.  Now I'd give them a bit more huff if they at least connected themselves to ambient like devices, nabaztag, or ambient orb, or something else other than forcing me to go to a widget to see if they ate a bagel or not today.. i dunno.  \n",1174398526

And those who succeed in helping the company financially are paid in return.",1174397297

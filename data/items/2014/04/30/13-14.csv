I would love it if all software interacted with the outside world. But a lot of software doesn&#x27;t interact -- just take a look at some of that code sitting in your repository sometime. Some of that isn&#x27;t deployed, isn&#x27;t being used. You could test that until the cows come home and have a whole bucket full of nothing.<p>Because the Bobster and the other TDD guys are correct: you gotta test to know that the code is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to. Testing has to come first. In a way, the test is actually more important than the code. If you get the tests right, and the code passes them, the code itself really doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Where we fall down is when we confuse the situation of a commercial software development team working on WhipSnapper 2.0 with a startup team working on SnapWhipper 0.1. The commercial guys? They are working on a piece of code with established value, with a funding agent in place, with a future of many years (hopefully) in production. Everything they create will be touched and used over a long period of time. The startup guys? They&#x27;ve got a 1-in-10 shot that they&#x27;re alive next year. Any energy they put into solving a problem that hasn&#x27;t been economically validated is 90% likely to be wasted.<p>Tests are important, but only when you&#x27;re testing the right thing. The test for the startup guys is a <i>business</i> test, not a code test. Is this business doing something useful? If so, then just about any kind of way of accomplishing that -- perhaps without any programming at all -- provides business value.<p>That&#x27;s a powerful lesson for startup junkies to assimilate. In the startup world, you don&#x27;t get rewarded based on the correctness or craftsmanship of your code. You&#x27;re looking at one or two weeds instead of realizing the entire yard needs work.<p>Put a different way, we have Markham&#x27;s Law: The cost of Technical Debt can never exceed the economic value of the software to begin with.<p></standard TDD comment>",1398866391
7673306,comment,7672910,7672910,20,0,timdierks,,,"While I don&#x27;t know if they do, I can see why Google might prioritize review of accounts which are about to receive a payout over ones where that&#x27;s far in the future: once the money is sent, it&#x27;s generally not recoverable. That&#x27;s when Google has the highest quotient of [data on the account] * [value at risk], so that&#x27;s when it makes sense to review.<p>AdWords and AdSense policies tell advertisers and publishers that advertiser spending on evicted publishers are refunded for the preceding 60 days. Because this policy has to do with revenue recognition, it&#x27;s presumably under SOX control, so it would be difficult and very risky to willfully violate it.<p>So Google faces a larger cash loss if they cancel a publisher just after a payout than if they do so before. And they have no incentive to cancel publishers just to keep the money: they refund the advertisers, so they lose not only their share of the advertising spend, but they have to pay the publisher share of any unrecoverable previous payout out of their own pockets.<p>Disclosure: I used to work for Google.",1398866389

7673301,comment,7666575,7668763,2,0,epistasis,,,"Just to be clear about how this is incredibly wrong, as clearly this poster has never read life science research, and it&#x27;s very strange for such a blatantly misinformed comment to stick around on HN.<p>There are no biologists out there who are just looking for correlations, mistaking them for the real finding. Look through the life science papers in Nature, Science, Cell, PLoS Biology, etc. You will find people starting with a hypothesis, and running controlled, causal experiments, often with two or three different methodologies to establish non-correlational evidence. These are often based on initial observations that are correlational, but there is no publication where people are like &quot;whoa, we found a correlation, our work is done!&quot;<p>In contrast, there are some subfields where most of the work is correlational, and those are the fields where researchers are limited to analyzing data more than running experiements: epidemiology and bioinformatics. Now epidemiologists collect tons of data, but there&#x27;s very little that they can do in noncorrelational analysis, because that&#x27;s the nature of ethics and human life. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t try to invalidate their correlation-based hypotheses with experiments, it&#x27;s just that they get to run very few of them. Bioinformatics is somewhat different, and in some ways is much more like a theoretical physics in that developing new methodology can be a publication-worth, even if there was no new data collected to validate the computational methodology.<p>In short, there&#x27;s no truth at all to what return0 posted.",1398866328

7673286,comment,7672910,7673118,1,0,jeffmould,,,"I agree. I do think there is a problem with the system. But I don&#x27;t believe it is a &quot;plot&quot; by Google specifically. I think it is more, like you say, overzealous algorithms that are resulting in the problems Adsense publishers are seeing. I do think there are some other areas of the algorithm that are just not working properly such as the PPC & CPM calculations.<p>I don&#x27;t think Google is necessarily doing this on purpose, but I do think, as with most Google products, they don&#x27;t utilize their resources properly to gather feedback from the publishers to identify exactly where the problems are and what is occurring in order to properly resolve them. Instead they see a fire internally and attempt to put it out which just pushes the problem to another area.  Adwords, and in turn Adsense, are the bread and butter for Google earnings, and while I understand it is nearly impossible to handle every publisher issue they must receive, Google has a bad reputation when it comes to dealing with any problem at all. I do know that when your Adsense account reaches I believe $100 a week (not positive on the exact amount but that is what it was at one time) in earnings you do get direct email access to their support team, but even this is not enough in most cases.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take long to do a quick Google search to see that these issues are not isolated to one or two users. It is a systematic problem that has been occurring for several years now. Some larger publishers have even identified specific IP addresses for click bots and reported them to Google, yet Google does nothing to ban these IP addresses causing more users to experience the problem.",1398866132

The work on better compilers for Lisp came most from other places: CMU for their Unix-based CMUCL, Franz with Allegro CL, Harlequin with LispWorks, Lucid had a very good compiler with Lucid CL, Dylan at Apple for early ARM, CLICC in Germany, SBCL as a clean up of CMUCL, Scieneer CL as a multi-core version of CMUCL, mocl as a version of CLICC for iOS/Android, ... plus a few special purpose compilers...<p>Once you add sophisticated compilation, dynamic languages implementations are no longer &#x27;dynamic&#x27;.<p>This topic is pretty much solved for Lisp. On one extreme we have fully dynamic interpreters + then dynamic AOT compiler based ones.

7673178,comment,7672396,7673101,7,0,jerf,,,"I think a lot of that delta is going to prove to have been an accident of history, though. In the past 10-15 years, we&#x27;ve had a lot of &quot;dynamic&quot; languages, which have hit a major speed limit (see another comment I made in this discussion about how languages really do seem to have implementation speed limits). Using a &quot;dynamic&quot; language from the 1990s has been easier than using gussied-up static 1970s tech for a quick prototype, but what if the real difference has more to do with the fact that the 1990s tech simply has more experience behind the design, rather than an inherent ease-of-use advantage?<p>It&#x27;s not hard to imagine a world where you instead use Haskell, prototyping your code in GHCi or even just writing it in Haskell directly, pay a minimal speed penalty for development since you&#x27;re not being forced to use a klunky type system, and get compiled speeds or even GPGPU execution straight out of the box. (And before anyone freaks out about Haskell, using it for numeric computations requires pretty much zero knowledge about anything exotic... it&#x27;s pretty straightforward.) It&#x27;s not out of the question that using Haskell in this way would prototype even faster than a dynamic language, because when it gives you a type error at compile time rather than at runtime, or worse, running a nonsense computation that you only discover afterwards was nonsense, you could save a lot of time.<p>I don&#x27;t think there has to be an inherent penalty to develop with native-speed tech...

Say, that you negotiate a better offer (2%-3%). In this case, if I judge the numbers correctly, that will match your current salary to what other companies on the market are offering (the 30-50K). However, that will ONLY match those offers - your risk in this case so you would have to negotiate a lot more to take into account the risk difference (30-50K fixed vs 30-50K potential).<p>Even if you do that, you will still have the insane work hours, the feeling that you are not appreciated enough and the risk hanging above your head whether you will hit the target salary.<p>2) Get a raise with both equity and money - you could negotiate a 1% equity + a decent cash raise. It will be difficult if your boss is so stingy but it is worth the shot. Keep in mind again your risk vs reward. I would at least want a raise of 20K + the 1% equity. That would give you more than what the market is offering you.<p>However, the point above applies here as well although you will be in a better position this time since you will have some stable cash increase.<p>3) GTFO from there<p>I have dealt with bosses like that and, in my opinion, you run a good risk of not being happy there, burnout, loss of motivation, etc. Your boss seems not to value his employees very much and this will most probably never change. I can imagine that you will always need to chaise the market average (just like now) and negotiate to actually be paid an amount which you could easily receive elsewhere (judging by your offers). Granted, my views on this are a bit extreme (I think that an appreciate boss should offer you a raise instead of you having to ask for one) but that is my opinion.<p>My advice: go and check out some of your other offers - it is very likely that you will find a better paying job with less working hours. If you have worked heavy hours until now, this change will do wonders for you. Once you find a nice place, leave.<p>Edit: last paragraph",1398865108

But after the past 5-10 years, in which <i>enormous</i> amounts of effort have been poured into salvaging our &quot;dynamic&quot; language&#x27;s (Python, JS, etc.) run speeds, which has pretty much resulted in them flatlining around ~5 times slower than C with what strikes me as little realistic prospect of getting much lower than that, it&#x27;s really getting time to admit that language design decisions do in fact impact the ultimate speed a language will be capable of running at. (For an example in the opposite direction, see LuaJIT, a &quot;dynamic&quot; language that due to careful design can often run at near-C.)<p>(BTW, before someone jumps in, no, current Javascript VMs do <i>NOT</i> run at speeds comparable to C. This is a common misconception. On trivial code that manipulates numbers only you can get a particular benchmark to run at C speeds, but no current JS VM runs at C speeds <i>in general</i>, nor really comes even close. That&#x27;s why we need asm.js... if JS VMs were already at C speeds you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get such speed improvements from asm.js.)",1398864604

Yet being presented with those linear equations as such, get us running away screaming into the night.</i><p>Because it is far easier to see value in solving real-world problems than to think in terms of just abstractions; and at the end of the day, real-world matters. Computers were invented for solving problems in reality, and that is one thing that should always be kept in mind when programming them. Abstractions, while powerful, also have a cost, both mentally and in terms of computing resources, and the latter is definitely finite, so being scared of them is both natural and reasonable.<p>To put it bluntly, how many programmers don&#x27;t know what &quot;Curry-Howard correspondence&quot;, &quot;first order logic&quot;, or &quot;denotational and operational semantics&quot; are, and yet have written hugely useful and popular applications? I argue that there is very little math and theory that one must know to do great things with programming - arithmetic and algebra are sufficient. So I believe we may see some truly wonderful things when we stop propagating this notion that computer science is hugely abstract maths, and instead focus on its more concrete aspects.

The malaria parasite microorganism, one of the species of the <i>Plasmodium</i> genus of protozoa,[2] is also being targeted directly both for vaccine prevention and for drug treatment of malaria, but part of the <i>Plasmodium</i> life cycle is obligatorily in living mosquitoes, so to kill mosquitoes is to reduce the load of the parasite and its risk to human populations.

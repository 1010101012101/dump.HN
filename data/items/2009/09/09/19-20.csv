Most likely, that history would involve an example of the same sort of problem being solved in the same sort of way.<p>Once you've seen solutions, they seem easy. So easy in fact, that it leads you to wonder why it took until, say, 1700 AD before someone came up with it. Much of present day knowledge has only existed for a few centuries and many 'obvious' things have been missed by millenia of great minds. The lesson from that is: we don't learn by being original or by having revelations: we learn by example and by abstraction from those examples. This is exactly such an example: you weren't supposed to have been able to think of it yourself. It's an example that shows you the way, that teaches you, that enables you to, maybe some day in the future, be original or have a revelation.",1252523877

This is where your thinking fails.<p>A business transaction is an exchange of money for something of value. The ""value"" is only determined by the buyer (where the price is non-negotiable). If the buyer considers the product valuable, then the transaction is legitimate. This is why it's legal to sell $100 track pants and call them ""yoga wear"". The buyer is in agreement that the track pants are worth $100.<p>You seem to think that there is an ultimate morality that can govern the perception of value, which there is not. Your bargain is easily my rip-off. It's fundamental market theory.<p>The <i>only time</i> you can call a business transaction a ""scam"" is when the value delivered is not what was agreed to prior to the event. So, if I tell you I will fix your roof for $50,000, and after I do this it leaks like a sieve, you have a case that I wasn't honest in living up to my end of the bargain, or have not fully lived up to my previous agreement.<p>If I promise to sell you mythical cherries that make every woman you meet fall in love with you, and you, in sound mind, <i>believe that these cherries work as advertised</i> I am not a scammer.<p>The ability to exploit ignorance of all shapes and sizes is a fundamental concept of the operation of a free market. I know that this can sound disturbing, but it is true. If I can't benefit from your lack of something, I can never create value for anyone.<p>When pg says ""create something of value"" he is really saying ""create something somebody values"".

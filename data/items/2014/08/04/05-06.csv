At 4 USD per trial that&#x27;s 100USD<p>Assuming 1% click to trial conversion we need 2500 clicks to get 25 trials.  That&#x27;s expensive.  So we need much better click to trial conversions. Assuming 1USD per click we need a 25% click to trial conversion.<p>I think it <i>feels</i> more likely to swap those rates around (4% click to trial, 25% trial to customer) but whatever my intuition is still waaaay out.<p>But either way it surprises me how <i>tight</i> 200 USD customer acquisition is.  It sounds pretty close to the steak dinner high touch sales you mention (I can think of some very nice places in London to lunch a client for 200 bucks) but in reality it&#x27;s eaten away by conversion rates far far faster than my intuition allows.<p>Thank you - whatever the &quot;real&quot; figures are working this through helps align my intuition with Mother Nature and if you had not put the numbers up I would not have worked it through - and when my billion dollar SaaS launches I would not have had the right intuition - which is the whole point of the exercise !<p>I miss excel :-)",1407131754

Microscopy is hardly the bottleneck in hematology; and neither is cell counting, which is already carried on by automated analyzers for the most part anyway [1,2]. The problem is the need of <i>differential staining</i>: due to fundamental physical limits, no amount of machine learning can ever distinguish key hematocytes like lymphocytes from granulocytes in raw, unstained samples from microphotographs alone. So unless you use spectroscopy --and there&#x27;s been some work done on that, <i>eg</i> [3,4]--, you need to <i>spread</i>, <i>fix</i> and <i>stain</i> your sample, each of which take a series of choreographed steps, reagents and considerable skill in controlled conditions to get (minimally) right [5] --hence the need for a lab.<p>So unless they attached a USB microspectrometer to the iPod, or streamlined the existing sample preparation process in a low-cost, fully-portable form; they are just solving the wrong problem.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mlo-online.com/articles/201401/automation-in-hematology-heres-the-state-of-the-art-in-2014.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mlo-online.com/articles/201401/automation-in-hema...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550479"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550479</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?uri=FiO-2008-FWD5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?uri=FiO-2008-FWD5</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/72/8_MeetingAbstracts/1705"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstra...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://mmserver.cjp.com/gems/blood/lh.6.1.houwen.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mmserver.cjp.com/gems/blood/lh.6.1.houwen.pdf</a>",1407131662

We didn&#x27;t win this (can&#x27;t win them all), but we had a lot of fun. I can&#x27;t wait until the next one. It was generally well ran for a first hackathon.<p>What I&#x27;m happy to see is that technically novel hacks won and not just hacks that are viable business ideas. (A javascript framework won a spot!)<p>Being a YC ran hackathon I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. Far too many hackathons have turned into not being about doing something fun and technically impressive but rather mini-investment pitch sessions. There is a place for that but it&#x27;s quickly becoming a bit silly. I love hackathons where you are judged by peers for the clever technical creations you create. I don&#x27;t like hackathons where you are judged by sponsors, mostly for using their APIs (it&#x27;s great to have sponsor prizes but that shouldn&#x27;t be the reason for a hackathon in many cases).<p>One thing that got me was the amount of press around this hackathon. The outside world was watching it and you could feel it. It don&#x27;t think anyone cared internally though that was hacking. It was just as relaxed as any other hackathon I&#x27;ve attended.<p>My wish list YC Hack next year:<p>- make it 48 hours (24 hours is almost too short and any longer than 48 is too much in my experience)<p>- less distractions (too many announcements. it was good at night though, but the music, while good, was too loud to speak to my teammates at points)<p>- do mini/fast pitches instead of floor demos. we were assigned a table outside and not many people came out there in the hot sun to see our hack. part of the fun of making something in the weekend is showing it off.<p>- keep it about this size. don&#x27;t grow it. the lottery and pre-submission was the right idea. if you have to many projects, it gets hard to demo and goes on for hours (See TC Disrupt). The quality of apps was super high here because of the pre-application process.<p>Everything was amazing though. I would say it&#x27;s in the top 10 hackathons I&#x27;ve attended of the 141.<p>Thanks most of all to Kat for organizing this thing. It was awesome.",1407131331

After a decade in the Navy, I always thought that talented programmers could do so much for the service, but the current system wasn’t designed for them.  Just take some of the people making it into Nuke School, move them to a programming pipeline, and form teams to attach to commands to help automate processes, create new processes if applicable, and help with SaaS procurements.   Give the teams their own command structure and embed them in a manner similar to JAGs and Docs. Switch IT to DevOps.<p>Unfortunately, the current software procurement process is totally broken.  It is the waterfall to end-all waterfalls.  Most of the militaries ‘high tech’ is at least a decade old when it becomes operational.  I remember in 2005, using a memory device the size of a brick (it’s nickname) with  something like 256kb of memory.  It could hold a total of 64 lat-long points.  The upgrade to a card holding megabytes was still far behind a cheap thumb drive.  Using an IPAD is so much better that the military started to okay flights with them.<p>Sadly, the military contracting process is so bad that they trap themselves with providers (HP) that border on treasonous behavior.  I exaggerate, but when you make a profit off of the military and provide essentially crap, you walk a fine line.[1]  Fixing this process from the top will require some serious changes and I wish I new what they were.<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/2010/08/hp-holds-navy-network-hostage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2010/08/hp-holds-navy-network-hostage/</a>",1407130460

To deduce a type for x, ghci will use 2^k type variables, if you have k ids. This is easily seen by induction:<p>If k = 1, then the type of x is a -> a. This takes 2 = 2^1 = 2^k variables.\nIf k > 1, it is of the form id f. Let t be the type of f. t has 2^{k - 1} variables, by induction. Thus the outermost id must take something of type t (this is 2^{k - 1} variables) and produce something of that same type t (this is another 2^{k - 1} variables), that is, it&#x27;s of type t -> t. 2^{k - 1} + 2^{k - 1} = 2^k.<p>Note that this information is purely at compile time.

8130481,comment,8130121,8130121,2,0,ghkbrew,,,"So, basically what the paper linked from this article describes is a method of taking a set of interacting regulator genes and determining the minimum set of genes which have to be perturbed (activated or repressed) to move the overall expression pattern from one stable state to another.<p>Their method involved grouping the genes into small sub-sets which have a small number of stable states.  Their example is two genes which repress each other acting as a toggle switch. They then connect those &quot;switches&quot; which influence each other, forming a larger graph.  The final step is to find the minimal set of genes (one from each strongly connected sub-graph of the DAG they just created) which will influence the entire network.<p>So once you know the major regulatory genes involved in different cell types this method allows you to pick a small groups of genes whose expression has to be modified to convert between the two.<p>Of course this entirely ignores the problem of coming with these regulatory networks in the first place.  Many genes and networks of genes have already been characterized in scientific literature, but I think it&#x27;s safe to say that there are many more that haven&#x27;t.  The issue being that there is no good way for determining gene interaction without lengthy in vivo analysis of each individual gene.<p>There are other difficulties as well.  As the authors mention, some effects of differentiation aren&#x27;t reversible with this technique, e.g. epigenetic modification.<p>This method, seems like it will gradually become more useful as our base of knowledge increases.  Just don&#x27;t expect it to do anything magical at the moment.  And contrary to what TFT implies it is far from computer-controlled cell reprogramming.",1407130229

Part of that is because &#x27;prior performance&#x27; carries signifiant weight, meaning that if you&#x27;re Lockheed Martin and you&#x27;ve done a 15000 user enterprise resource planning project before you have a leg up on the 50 person IT shop that hasn&#x27;t, even if said IT shop is far more competent.<p>But really before you even get to the contract, the fact of the matter is that a lot of the full time government employees making the IT decisions are flat out incompetent.  The contractor might have smart people that can do excellent work but if the FTE continually makes bad strategic decisions the best coders in the world are not going to be able to deliver a great system.  The original article goes a little bit into that where it talks about how technical people in government don&#x27;t have the power.<p>Another problem is that government people are rarely held accountable for their failures.  They in turn often don&#x27;t hold contractors accountable.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that the government has systematically reduced the amount of full time employee programmers in favor of contractors.  That isn&#x27;t necessarily bad in some ways, but basically it results in the government paying a lot more money to get the same technical expertise.  The argument is usually, &quot;Yeah but we don&#x27;t have to pay for a contractor&#x27;s benefits.&quot;  Yet the government is paying 2 or more times the cost of a full-time employee per year for the contractor bill rate.<p>I think for government IT to truly improvement there needs to be some serious structural changes to the way government work is done from contract awards to employee accountability to the composition of the government work force.

8130424,comment,8130189,8130338,1,0,GVIrish,,,"The fact that in government work spending money wisely is not critical the way it is in private sector is a component of the problem.  But I think the more fundamental problem it points to is a lack of consequences for poor performance.  An agency can waste a lot money but rarely does any experience consequences for it.  A department can fail miserably on big initiatives, small initiatives and everything in between but again, rarely does anyone get fired or even disciplined for that.  Even in the most high profile government IT failure in US history, no one was asked to resign.<p>Start creating real accountability for government organizations and the right people can actually rise to the top and the wrong people can get weeded out (rather than waiting until the bad apples retire).  People will start paying a lot more attention to their budgets when they&#x27;re actually held responsible for using them wisely.<p>> Instead of cutting budgets where people can save money, they should be increasing budgets of those people that can save money or spend it wisely.<p>While that sounds like a simple solution, it would incentivize people to make ill-advised cuts one year so the budget could be increased next year.  Really all that needs to be done to end the end of fiscal year spending spree is to not reduce budgets when an organization doesn&#x27;t spend all of it in a given year",1407128920

I love to help the kids learn and I even try to teach them (to some extent) how to code.<p>The thing that gets their interest every time is something physical. I can sit them in front of Scratch for four hours twice a week, or this, or LOGO, or any of a multitude of other solutions, but the two things that never fail to interest them are Lego Mindstorms and my quadcopter. My quadcopter usually catches their attention (wow, a machine that can go over a hundred miles an hour! cool!) but the Lego Mindstorms robot is what keeps them interested.<p>This is because they have no idea of how to build a quadcopter that can go as fast as mine (which is reasonable, considering it took eight months to build mine - it&#x27;s among the fastest in the world and may even be the fastest) but they do know how to drag and drop blocks to make the robot go.<p>My point is: there has to be some kind of moment where you snag the kids&#x27; attention. I don&#x27;t see any moment here that would make the kids excited. Seeing my quadcopter soar through the sky at over a hundred miles an hour fascinates them. Seeing the robot move across the board, shoot projectiles or battle another robot (at their command!) fascinates them. But having a virtual character follow commands in an interface which looks like it came out of a preschool? I doubt it.<p>It looks like this may be targeted towards very young children, but in that case my worry is not that this won&#x27;t snag their attention (very young children are much more interested in a computer game than my quadcopter) but rather that they&#x27;ll simply forget about it by the time they learn to read and write (and thus even be able to start reading and writing code.)<p>Here&#x27;s another comment I made about teaching kids to code: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7450503"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7450503</a>",1407128633

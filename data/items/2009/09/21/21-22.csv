835699,comment,835172,835554,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"IANAN. The sensor detection sounds pretty unlikely. But what about some other possible methods:<p>The end of an SLR lens is domed/convex, and slightly reflective (even the best ones are slightly). The lens would have to be pointed at the ship for the system to care about it. In that state, shining a laser at the lens and detecting the reflection would pick up the reflection profile of the convex surface (you'd need a 2d array of sensors to pick up the range of return angles as the laser moves from the center of the lens), and finding the center would be fairly easy - so you'd know where to fire. How many other reflective convex surfaces have their axis of rotation pointed straight at the boat?<p>I imagine this is mostly a problem when in dock, or at anchor, where the paparazzi are probably all in one  location (or a few), so the search space could be very quickly narrowed down by a human.<p>Seems like a pretty frivolous way to spend money, but at least it's being spent.",1253570200

The anthropic principle is science's equivalent of the ""God did it"" card and is invoked anytime people test the limits of existing models.<p>Take for example this extract from the wiki article(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle</a>)<p>Roger Penrose explained the weak form as follows:<p><pre><code>    ""The argument can be used to explain why the conditions happen to be just right for the existence of (intelligent) life on the earth at the present time.\n    For if they were not just right, then we should not have found ourselves to be here now, but somewhere else, at some other appropriate time. \n    This principle was used very effectively by Brandon Carter and Robert Dicke to resolve an issue that had puzzled physicists for a good many years. \n    The issue concerned various striking numerical relations that are observed to hold between the physical constants (the gravitational constant, the mass of the proton, the age of the universe, etc.). \n    A puzzling aspect of this was that some of the relations hold only at the present epoch in the earth's history, so we appear, coincidentally, to be living at a very special time (give or take a few million years!). \n    This was later explained, by Carter and Dicke, by the fact that this epoch coincided with the lifetime of what are called main-sequence stars, such as the sun. \n    At any other epoch, so the argument ran, there would be no intelligent life around in order to measure the physical constants in question-so the coincidence had to hold, simply because there would be intelligent life around only at the particular time that the coincidence did hold!""\n    The Emperor's New Mind, Chapter 10\n</code></pre>\nRather than create a model of how this coincidence occurs, it is simply ignored as ""well it had to occur or we couldn't talk about it"".  For example, this coincidence may occur because we somehow derive our relational understandings and measurements from universal constants in the first place.<p>You can certainly derive something from the fact that we (life) exist but when you explain away observations with a simple ""well we couldnt be here to talk about it otherwise"" you are implying one of the following:<p>1. There is a design to the universe<p>2. The universe as it is is inevitable<p>3. Every possible combination of variables has existed or does exist and we are simply the result of the law of large numbers.<p>Either way there is some burden of proof.",1253567366

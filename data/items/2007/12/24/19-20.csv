Breaking backward compatibility just means <i>not everything is guaranteed to work the same</i> -- it does NOT mean that <i>now everything is different</i>.  It's still Python.<p>Being ""out of date"" doesn't make any sense -- today's libraries aren't suddenly going to become <i>less</i> functional later.  The stuff that works today will still work 5 years from now.<p>You change versions IF the new version gives you something you need.  You don't change just because it's new.<p>And, always, the paper tiger is better than the real one.  Not doing something <i>today</i> because it'll be outdated in a few years would mean never doing <i>anything</i> in the computer industry.",1198524462

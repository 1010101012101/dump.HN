Silly, ridiculous relic.<p>Not everyone views the world from an empiricist or materialist atheistic viewpoint. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nice to say something is ridiculous simply because you don&#x27;t see it that way. Further, many followers of religion wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s supernatural at all - it&#x27;s part of nature that hasn&#x27;t been uncovered, or it can&#x27;t be uncovered.<p>>Please don&#x27;t bore us with the usual equivocating about how Buddhism is different, and complex, highly personal, etc.<p>Buddhism is largely different from other religions, first and foremost that it doesn&#x27;t mandate the worship of a god, and further can be interpreted in such a way that can dispense with <i>most of</i> what you see as supernatural. Secondly, for it&#x27;s &quot;find out yourself&quot; nature that encourages questioning and going beyond the realm of logical thinking.<p>And it is highly personal - it&#x27;s got the idea that you have to be the one to set yourself on the path. You can&#x27;t be saved by someone simply by praying etc.<p>>I&#x27;m not aware of any useful aspects of Buddhism that don&#x27;t have a purely secular equivalent.<p>Buddhists are aware of one - it&#x27;s called Nibbana - and it can only be realized by following the Noble Eightfold Path, which I will say relies heavily on the idea of kamma and &quot;supernatural&quot; ideas.<p>Please do not be so dismissive.",1447797449

I&#x27;d bet it&#x27;s still piracy partly or mostly.<p>To be clear, I block them too for their annoyance and malware risks they pose. I push for solutions to that (eg Adblock&#x27;s Acceptable Ads, ADsafe). Well, some like Youtube I let through because they&#x27;re easy enough to ignore (esp with mute button). Amazon and eBay have those, too. On rare occasions, it&#x27;s actually something I&#x27;m interested in. The rest are blocked by default.

That can be a huge advantage, given that differentiation is the only thing that will make your product stand out in the marketplace.<p>Are you in a latency-critical domain, which Google Search is?  Then optimize to minimize the number of bytes shipped to the user and startup time.  Do you have 100+ screenfuls of information?  Then optimize so that making new screens is easy.  Do users load your app once, leave it open in the background, but then need to perform a number of interactions quickly?  Then ship down the initial interface quickly and progressively lazy-load bundles of functionality that are just a JS function away on click, like GMail does.<p>Incidentally, one of the main reasons Google Search finally adopted Closure was because it had to integrate with Google+, which was all done using Closure.  So again, the choice of a framework was driven by product concerns.<p>It&#x27;s not a failure when a company builds a home-grown framework that is carefully tailored to the product needs that they&#x27;ve discovered over the last few years.

As opposed to what actually happened when we did nothing, which is Islamic extremists being the main supporters of the resistance, versus the Russian and Iranian backed Assad. Assad believes that the West will grudgingly back him against ISIS extremists, and not so much against secular rebels, so naturally he turned the bulk of his guns against the secular rebels. With nobody supporting them and everybody against them, of course their presence and influence dwindled to nothing.<p>I mostly agree with fineman, except that I think it&#x27;s too late for backing secular resistance to have much of a point.

Previous studies had not been able to identify naturally occurring mass dependent fractionation, within the error of the mass spectrometry measurements. Therefore it was necessary to develop new analytical methods that were highly precise.  ... . Although the field of Fe isotopes is currently in its developmental stage, much like oxygen isotopes was five decades ago; it is rapidly becoming a common geochemical tool.<p>Here&#x27;s a PhD thesis from 2004, <a href=""http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/53550"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/53550</a> , which concludes &quot;The observed range in the Fe isotopic composition of the natural samples including biological and aqueous samples demonstrates that significant and useful fractionation is associated with Fe biogeochemistry in the environment&quot;. Note that the author received a MS from University of Wisconsin-Madison, which the 2005 article is about, and the New Yorker piece also concerns the Wisconsin group.<p>So looking to a more recent Nature article which doesn&#x27;t mention direct ties to the Wisconsion group, <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/130719/ncomms3143/full/ncomms3143.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/130719/ncomms3143/full/nco...</a> titled &quot;Distinct iron isotopic signatures and supply from marine sediment dissolution&quot; (2013):<p>> Microbial sediment respiration supports a major flux of dissolved and isotopically light Fe to the global ocean8, 9, 10, by catalysing the reductive dissolution (RD) of Fe oxyhydroxide minerals during organic matter decomposition11<p>You asked &#x27;And terrestrial?&#x27;, but you statement was a flat &#x27;there&#x27;s no evidence for it&#x27;, which includes in the ocean. Note that the New Yorker article says &quot;The ancient iron formations share many characteristics with modern limestones, which suggests that they accumulated in a marine environment&quot;.<p>But even then, you say &quot;Those would be something significantly new.&quot;<p>Yes, I believe that&#x27;s the reason the New Yorker wrote this piece.

When the spirit of liberty which now animates our hearts and gives success to our arms is extinct, our numbers will accelerate our ruin, and render us easier victims to tyranny. Ye abandoned minions of an infatuated ministry, if peradventure any should yet remain among us!—remember that a Warren and Montgomery are numbered among the dead. Contemplate the mangled bodies of our countrymen, and then say, What should be the reward of such sacrifices ? Bid us and our posterity bow the knee, supplicate the friendship, and plough, and sow, and reap, to glut the avarice of the men who have let loose on us the dogs of war to riot in our blood, and hunt us from the face of the earth? <i>If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude, than the animating contest of freedom—go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen.</i><p>-Sam Adams, American Independence Speech, August 1, 1776.<p><a href=""https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/American_Independence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/American_Independence</a>",1447794795

The overall volume of contributions hasn&#x27;t gone down and the volume of thoughtful and substantive contributions had gone up, and for me it feels like a more safe and welcoming place in which to post thoughtful comments.<p>The point of the comment could have been made in a civil and thoughtful way if the commenter chose to do so, and when people do that, there is far more &quot;learning&quot; to be had and we all benefit.",1447794192

It’s rare that we don’t get a better deal for consumers than they can negotiate themselves. Why?<p>First, we work directly with the GM or fleet managers at dealers who are focused on volume sales, instead of a commissioned salesperson at the dealer. The 1.25% fee we charge dealers is actually cost neutral (or better) for the dealer as they otherwise pay their own sales people 25% - 30% of the profit on any deal in commissions. By the time we engage the dealer, we have a customer ready to buy and it’s a super efficient transaction.<p>Second, we negotiate to get our customers the best outcome across the whole deal, not just the upfront price. If you don’t focus on the other parts (trade-in, finance/lease terms, rebates/incentives, avoiding extra options you don’t want, etc.), you will likely have a less-than-ideal outcome. We work with customers every day where people thought they had a great price from a dealer, but we end up saving a bunch on their monthly payment.<p>Finally, we offer our customers transparency (we share every aspect of the deal before you make any commitment) and time savings (how much is your weekend worth?).<p>Happy to answer any questions about our service.",1447794071

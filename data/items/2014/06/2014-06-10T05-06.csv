7872019,comment,7871508,7871508,2,0,vanderZwan,,,"> <i>What are the arts but products of the human mind which resonate with our aesthetic and emotional faculties?</i><p>Ah, the old &quot;mental equivalent of cheesecake&quot; argument - Pinker explicitly used that one for music IIRC, which supposedly hijacked our love of language. The latter goes against fairly overwhelming evidence that music is a much older &quot;faculty&quot; than language. Then again, Pinker is a philosopher (don&#x27;t get me wrong, a wonderful one), and philosophers tend to fetishize language. When you look at the topic of the article that obviously applies to Pinker too. But to give a specific example, look this quote:<p>> <i>The medium by which we share complex ideas, namely language</i><p>THE medium? While extremely powerful, vocal or written language is a linear, monotone string of abstract symbols, which has some severe limitations in certain situations (but for comparison, check out sign language; three spatial dimensions to play with, oh my!). We don&#x27;t say &quot;a picture says more than a thousand words&quot; because it isn&#x27;t true. Similarly, music often <i>mediates</i> emotions in a much clearer and directer way than words ever do. In turn, pictures and music have their ambiguities in places where language shines of course.<p>Anyway, so we supposedly have these &quot;faculties&quot; somewhere in the brain for aesthetics and emotions, distinct functions evolved that way for some purpose, and then these get hijacked by things that trigger it (art), like some supernormal stimulus[0].<p>While it sure can be helpful to analyze things in these terms, and is consistent within its own framework, I think saying art is &quot;nothing but&quot; this is a bit too reductionist, greatly oversimplifying things. You simply won&#x27;t see the bigger picture with this approach. For example, Petran Kockelkoren has argued that art is part of the process of &quot;domesticating&quot; new technologies, societal changes, etc[1]. That is, the way in which we take something &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;unnatural&quot; and make it &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; to us.<p>Having said all that, I love Steve Pinker, his writing and his clear thinking and think it&#x27;s a great article. Just this itty bitty point always ruffles my feathers a bit.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://doc.utwente.nl/79298/1/Kockelkoren05art.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.utwente.nl/79298/1/Kockelkoren05art.pdf</a>",1402379858

7871993,comment,7867634,7868163,2,0,fancyketchup,,,"As others have mentioned, there is no universal definition of FP. But if you&#x27;re willing to stretch your personal definition of FP to include LabVIEW, then there are a considerable number of real FP applications used every day in research and industry for real, productive things.  It&#x27;s just that LabVIEW tends to be considered outside the domain of &quot;software engineers,&quot; so most people here probably haven&#x27;t hear of it.  Nevertheless, it is a real programming language, and you can do anything with it that you could do with any other language (albeit, much more tediously).<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard of LabVIEW described as a functional language (and it&#x27;s clearly not a &quot;purely&quot; functional language), but it programs like one.  Programs are written by connecting VIs (functions in LabVIEW-speak) with wires in a data-flow diagram.  VIs don&#x27;t contain any state (usually, unless you explicitly use local or global variables--which all the documentation warns you never to do upon pain of something really awful).  VIs mostly don&#x27;t have side-effects (unless you&#x27;re explicitly doing something with the filesystem, or data acquisition, or motion control, or... ).<p>One of the difficulties of using FP for &quot;real&quot; things is that you give up something you got for free with imperative languages, namely control of timing.  LabVIEW works around this with something called a sequence diagram, which forces VIs to be called in a deterministic order (because, being FP, you can&#x27;t otherwise divine in what order VIs will be called).<p>LabVIEW also encourages the use of a trick to enforce sequencing without using sequence structures (and this trick is absolutely mandatory if you don&#x27;t want a write-only program): The abstract name of an instrument resource is passed to a VI, and then returned unchanged.  Since the returned values of a function aren&#x27;t determined until it is run, you can chain several functions together in this way so that they run in sequence (which, IMHO, is bad practice because this abstract resource thing being passed about is something which is needed by each function, and <i>can</i> be modified by each function, but <i>SHOULDN&#x27;T</i> be modified by any function).<p>Annoyances aside, I&#x27;ve written a number of medium-sized programs in LabVIEW that implement entire data acquisition systems, including control of external instruments, positioning of mechanical parts, high voltage power supplies (no side effects, heh, sure thing), pulsed lasers (same), and a synchronous detector of my own design.  I would also note that the data acquisition systems do not use any local or global variables (as LabVIEW uses those terms), so it could be argued that they are have a very high &quot;functional purity,&quot; though that was not my intention when I wrote them.<p>My personal opinion is that the productivity claims of the FP camp are largely inflated.  Maybe FP is better suited to problem domains that exist entirely inside the computer.",1402379047

For one thing, &quot;have less latency&quot; is often the opposite: a keypress in a multiprocess browser has to travel from the user-facing process to the child process, then the effects have to travel back. In a single-process browser, there is no need to cross that boundary back and forth. You can see this in action in games for example, where you can sometimes see more input lag in multiprocess browsers.<p>Regarding speed, depends how you define it. Definitely multiprocess gives you responsiveness - one slow tab doesn&#x27;t slow down the others. But throughput, not necessarily.<p>Overall though, multiprocess is a good thing.

You have to track your receipts also, and it might even be a good idea to have the corporation ""reimburse"" you for the computer through company funds. I hear you also have to be very careful with the home office deduction, because it's a major red flag for auditors.",1205607270

Flash has great multimedia benefits and appear exactly the same cross browser.<p>Sure if you only have text and images, you might want to use html/css instead of frustrating your user, but there are many sites which fully utilize flash in an efficient manner.",1205606757

I, too, much prefer the open web, and resent anything that promotes the adoption of closed alternatives.<p>You're right that one can't fault a guy <i>too</i> much for picking the tech. he likes best, but it's hard not to have a certain distaste for someone who's actions, however slightly, move us closer to a day when we'd be forced to use proprietary tools/protocols/servers to perform most tasks on the Internet.<p>As developers with this view, of course, all we can do is work to make the 'open' alternatives as attractive as possible.  Calling people 'assholes' isn't helpful.  Cathartic, though.",1205606673

137644,comment,137486,137538,0,0,maximilian,,,"The only thing that would stop me from getting a MB over a MBP is the screen.  The ""new"" MBP LED-backlit screens are <i>amazing</i>!.  So clear and bright.  The MB glossy screens definitely leave something to be desired.  They aren't terrible by any means, but in comparison they just suck.  If they fix the MB screens then its basically a no brainer.  Put 4GB of ram in the thing and be done with it.<p>I'm running an old 1stgen alu-Powerbook.  It works well enough that I can't possibly justify buying a new one.  I'll probably get the Macbook as its pretty cheap when you get the entry level one (especially with the student discount, which I am).  I'll surely put 4GB of ram in it though.  With that $1000 I save on the macbook pro, I can get 2 months rent, 2 months groceries, a track bike + 1 month rent, a nearly complete climbing kit, a new surfboard <i>and</i> a track bike.  I guess you should look at what You'd spend that $1000 on.  If you'd spend it on really great things, get the macbook.  If not, get the macbook pro for its wonderful screen and fasterness.",1205606182
137643,comment,137536,137536,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"At present, it is arguably a very poor idea for the average American to earn a PhD in science (or anything else). I am concerned about removing the cap on visas for foreign graduate students in science.<p>When there is an unlimited supply of foreigners willing to work for nothing, salaries for graduate students will surely be depressed even further. I suspect they may decrease to the minimum wage. I suspect few Westerners, with much better options, would be willing to work for the minimum wage for the better part of a decade.<p>There may be an increase in the number of PhD graduates as a result of their cheapness. Of course, the salaries for professional researchers would then drop. Very suddenly, scientists will become a cheap commodity.<p>These new visas may be a good thing for business, but I fear they are a disaster for any American making a career in science.",1205606117

There are few things though:<p>The ""JOIN NOW"" part of the login section needs to be toned down. It looks like a desperate attempt to grab an attention of 80 yrs old with an eyesight problems. Besides you are using 3 font sizes in this section, which makes it look clumsy.<p>""Signin"" should be ""Sign in"", ""Logged out sucessfully"" is misspelled too.<p>Try resizing your browser window and see how the page looks at wide and narrow widths. It does not look that good and this needs to be fixed.<p>Upon logging in however I can't say it's ready to go live. It just feels like a prototype rather than a shippable product. Even not considering the functionality, it's just not polished enough and does not look visually appealing.<p>If you launch now, I can pretty much guarantee you it's going to be a failure. However, if you are at liberty to treat this project as an experiment, I'd suggest to go ahead and launch. Learning from the failure is one of the best and quickest ways to get a real world experience.",1205604102

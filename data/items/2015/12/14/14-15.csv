Almost certainly if you&#x27;re not familiar with mathematical proof (maybe you took a discrete math course before). If you know what it is to prove then you&#x27;ll learn an interesting deep connection between programming and proving.<p>You probably don&#x27;t want to prove things in your programs. Not really. Even after you learn Coq it&#x27;s too difficult to do day-to-day.<p>But proofs do not work without being completely consistent in the same way that good programs are. So you can learn a lot of techniques for good programs from techniques for good proofs. Coq rejects bad proofs, so it can be good practice.<p>Finally, Coq is unashamedly higher-order. The chops you gain working with it will translate more or less directly to better functional programming comprehension.",1450105147

So it preloads whatever the last view of the system is, and displays that as the truth, while it loads a new one in the background, which takes sometimes as long as 60 seconds.<p>So I could see that looking like it&#x27;s displaying inaccurate data, because it&#x27;s unclear that it&#x27;s refreshing the data.",1450105074

(For its time it was certainly revolutionary, but I&#x27;d call it too revolutionary for sufficient adoption.) Sergei Brin, Marc Andreessen, and John Doerr thought that Google Glass was going to change the world. Many smart people were quoted similarly on the Segway. Ditto on 90&#x27;s VR or any number of other interesting ideas that turned out to have some flaw or not deliver sufficient value.<p>I have used neither Glass nor the latest generation of VR. Which I&#x27;m ok with. If I did, I might or might not think them cool, but that&#x27;s irrelevant. I&#x27;m not in any of the plausible market niches for early-stage VR, so my personal experience won&#x27;t say anything useful. The kind of evidence I&#x27;m asking for here is not whether somebody thinks something is amazing. It is whether they are finding it useful enough on a day-to-day basis that they are paying for it and re-paying for it.<p>If they are, that&#x27;s great.

Ticket sales are down, and fewer people are watching it on TV as well.<p>As the other commenter said, this is completely false. The NBA has been doing everything right by focusing on stars and personalities. People are much more likely to like/hate a player in the NBA than they are the NFL. The NFL is trying to replicate the star thing that the NBA does, but no players are on the field all the time and helmets make players hard to recognize.<p>Having been to both NBA and NFL games, I always feel more in the game when at the NBA game. IMHO, NFL games are best watched on TV, while the NBA is great in person particularly in the first 10 rows.<p>The biggest issue for the NFL cash cow are concussions and parents not letting their kids play football.

Changing or adding new things to do, with the focus that teamwork should come first, and trying to make things more authentic with real life weapons/vehicles/tactics. I can say we were pretty successful with that goal, even with all the limitations of the game engine, and it&#x27;s amazing how different from the original game the mod looks and plays.<p>We also saw people coming and going over all these years. By being a volunteer project, we get the cool thing of getting very passioned players that see the same potential that I did when I started. Not many will stay for long and that&#x27;s normal, we only ask that people work on what they want. If something doesn&#x27;t get worked on, oh well, so be it.<p>The community can&#x27;t really complaint, if they do, we can always say: &quot;if you want to change that, learn how, and do it yourself&quot;. And that&#x27;s pretty much our process of getting new team members. It requires a lot of commitment to get something done right, so in that time we help as much as possible and see if the person will be a good fit to join the actual development team. Not just things like the actual quality of the work, but what their attitude is, if they listen to criticism well, if they work well with others, if they have initiative, if they have the same vision as the project, etc. If they seem fit, they start taking part of the actual decisions for the future of the mod.<p>My experience with the mod was priceless. It requires some strong leadership, like in any endeavor, and that leadership does change over time as people leave and others arise to the occasion. We have been managing it quite well, I would say, and it has been a fantastic project to have worked on.",1450104722

High-level enough for web development, yet faster them my trusted Ruby code, and seemingly more maintainable.<p>The main benefit of OO I know experience is it&#x27;s popularity. Going from Java to Ruby is a lot easier then from Ruby to Clojure or Haskell. The good news: many OO languages are incorporating FP&#x27;isms, and allowing a functional approach to solve problems, this helps FP like myself newcomers quite a bit.<p>TL;DR: I came to the realisation that the benefits of OO where mainly theoretical and did not hold in practice.

You can encode other problems into the specific problem, at a cost. Currently this algorithm on specific hardware is not as fast as state-of-the art algorithms on ordinary hardware (namely Selby&#x27;s). But the people making this special hardware claim (no proof) that when the special hardware (and the problem size) is scaled up, the special hardware will be much faster than ordinary hardware. So far no-one has disproved this assertion, but no-one has proven or demonstrated it either.<p>Meanwhile, many other scientists and some companies, who refer to this type of special hardware as &quot;dirty QC&quot;, are working on another class of special hardware they call &quot;clean QC&quot;. This is mathematically proven to be much faster than ordinary hardware when it is scaled up, but it&#x27;s very very very difficult to scale it up. But they&#x27;re working on it and showing progress.<p>Right now, no-one knows if the &quot;dirty&quot; or the &quot;clean&quot; special hardware will be the first to be actually useful in the real world. It&#x27;s likely the first useful real world application is more than ten years away. We don&#x27;t know exactly what the application will be, or how the special hardware then will be programmed.

We&#x27;ve won once and are considered a strong team. However, the difference between the a strong team, and the better team in a night, is the fact that our team fosters a &quot;no suggestion is a dumb suggestion&quot; policy. No matter how stupid you think your answer is, you are encouraged to say it. In fact, if we see body language from a person hesitating we&#x27;re quick to jump in and say &quot;Spit it out! Just say it!&quot;<p>We essentially create a safe zone for our team members to not worry about the consequences of a wrong answer. There were so many times where a completely wrong suggestion makes another teammate say, &quot;Hey! Wait, I think I remember!&quot;<p>We also have a policy of if a person has a different answer than the rest, then he/she has to &quot;fight for it&quot;. That is, you have to convince the rest of the team. By having a &quot;fight for it&quot; rule, we put controlled confrontation on the centre of the table and let people hash it out. There is no regret, or fear, or worrying about feelings. It&#x27;s just a normal part of our evening that is done with humour and friendliness. Firm, but friendly!<p>By doing the above, we instil confidence in every team member. Those that are more confident by their nature, can still be challenged by anyone and keeps them in check, and the weaker confident ones feel safer to step forward when they need to. It balances out and our team has absolutely great chemistry because of it.<p>I&#x27;ve also played team sports for most of my life and some of the best teams I&#x27;ve played for had former professional athletes. Since they were stronger than the rest and more confident, they always raised their hand and took the blame for any mistake! It was quite funny because we knew my screw up was not their fault, but they would make an excuse about how they should&#x27;ve done &#x27;X&#x27; and I wouldn&#x27;t have screwed up.<p>Needless to say, that allowed players like me that weren&#x27;t former pros, to be at ease and to be more confident and give my best, knowing that the strongest player on the team wasn&#x27;t going to look down on me for every mistake.<p>It was a very interesting dynamic where the more confident person ensured that the less confident person is playing their best and it raised their confidence.

10731059,comment,10728463,10728857,0,0,spangry,,,"Interesting that this debate always centres on current bandwidth capability. I think the two biggest economic advantages of &#x27;fibre to the home&#x27; are actually lower latency and future upgradability.<p>On latency, the round-trip time for a packet between Sydney and LA is about 2-3x slower than one would realisticly expect from the transmission medium. Why? It&#x27;s the routing hops that introduce the additional latency. So it stands to reason that FTTH == fewer routing/repeating hops == lower latency. This is in contrast to &#x27;fibre to the node&#x27;, which requires additional routing hops, more resending and error correction, and, if you want to use fancy technologies like VDSL &#x27;vectoring&#x27;, more active processing of communications in transit (to calculate the correct cross-talk cancelling noise to push down all lines). In addition, wave-division multiplexing with latency at 99.7 per cent the speed of light in a vacuum has been achieved on fibre (admittedly in a lab/academic setting) over a distance of 310 metres (source: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphoton.2013.45"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphoton.2013.45</a>).<p>Why is lower latency desirable, from a national economic perspective? Because it creates larger scope for distributed computation of non-parallel processing and higher IO for geographically distributed storage. So data-centres can be located on cheaper land, further away from the CBD. Perhaps in future it also means someone in Darwin could utilise the idling processor, or spare hard disk space, of someone in Sydney via something like Etherium. All of this becomes harder and less efficienct as latency creeps up. For general background, see: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-optic_communication#Comparison_with_electrical_transmission"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-optic_communication#Comp...</a><p>On future upgradability, I&#x27;d argue we&#x27;re reaching the upper bandwidth limits of what copper can provide (as a real world, fixed line infrastructure). This seems to be around 100-150mbit non-symmetric under the most ideal conditions, using some pretty fancy tech (on both the carrier and consumer ends), although the hypothetical maximum is supposedly around 10Gbits (achievable in LANs, unlikely to be achievable in WANs with current copper assets). How long until this is not &#x27;enough&#x27;? In contrast, for single strand fibre, NEC have achieved 101Tbit/s over 165km, and NTT 69.1 Tbit/s over 240km.<p>Cisco projects the volume of global IP traffic to grow at a compounding annualised growth rate of 23% between 2014 and 2019; in other words global IP traffic volume will triple in 5 years (source: <a href=""http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/VNI_Hyperconnectivity_WP.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-pr...</a>). Keep in mind this is strictly global IP traffic. Alcatel-lucent and Bell Labs, factoring in &#x27;metro&#x27; (non-backbone) traffic (e.g. office to datacentre, consumer to CDN), forecast a quadrupling of bandwidth volume between 2015 and 2020, with an apparently exponential growth rate (source: <a href=""https://mc-11560-1882305812.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/sites/default/files/dm2015019535_fig01_june1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mc-11560-1882305812.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/site...</a>).<p>By opting to &#x27;destroy&#x27; the original NBN, our government has knee-capped Australia&#x27;s future economic prospects.

On HBO, only the &quot;main&quot; HBO is in HD.  The other HBO channels are only SD.  Same goes for other cable.  The &quot;big&quot; channels and network re-broadcasts are in HD or SD but many of the more niche channels are only in SD.<p>Additionally, with the phasing out of unencrypted QAM, you can&#x27;t easily use your own tuner.  I used to use a simple Hauppauge card in a PC along with a software tuner/DVR program to handle all of my channel flipping and recording but now I have to use their crappy cable box.  In theory I could get a different PCI or USB card/box and rent a CableCard to handle the decryption and use my own tuner/DVR but CableCard is very poorly supported both in terms of software compatibility and cableco support.<p>In the end, we decided to keep cable for now even though I watch maybe one or two shows on traditional cable every week.  The vast majority of my watching is done on Netflix or HBOGo.  Still, my gf likes the convenience of just being able to flip through channels and she does a lot more &quot;casual&quot; watching of stuff that wouldn&#x27;t be found on Netflix.  If we swapped cable for Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, and whatever other OTT subscription services, it wouldn&#x27;t save a whole lot of money and you&#x27;d be stuck dealing with various apps and websites to find the specific thing you&#x27;re looking for.<p>If it was just me, I&#x27;d probably skip cable TV but since it&#x27;s both of us, we have to balance the actual savings against the very real issue of convenience, usability, and options.<p>I think a main issue is that there&#x27;s not always an easy way to find the cheaper cable plans.  They aren&#x27;t well advertised and we typically get these offers after specifically asking for them from a cable customer service rep.",1450102579

Quantum annealing is similar to Simulated annealing, and if you compare the D-Wave machine to simulated annealing implemented on normal, non specialized, hardware, the D-Wave is 100,000,000 times faster.<p>In principal, even if the hardware only supports one algorithm, this could tell us something about whether quantum computers are really better than normal computers. Unfortunately the D-Wave machine/algorithm is still not much better than simply simulating a quantum machine in normal hardware (Quantum Monte Carlo) and worse than the conventional algorithm by Alex Selby.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, but it still doesn&#x27;t shed much light on the important questions.",1450101918

Perhaps: MicrosoftBoot (implying it could only boot a Microsoft OS, or the specific version of Windows your PC came with)?<p>(In a sense, dropping TLS is the correct response...

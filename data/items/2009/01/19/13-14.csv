I never had problems with SBCL on any machine, runs on my VPS, with threading, like a charm. Also, noone forced him to learn and use Emacs. There are Vim modes or CUPS for Eclipse. Destructive functions are the language's feature. If not sure, just use non-destructive. It's also not CL's fault he doesn't understand macros and can't use CL-WHO.<p>I like Clojure, but I like CL better. One guy's incompetence learning CL doesn't mean Clojure wins.",1232373346

440427,comment,440269,440269,0,0,mattjung,,,"From the great book ""Founders at Work"", I had the impression that a common point of success is to persue an idea to a very end, to fully understand its potential, to not accept failure too early, but to accept to modify and even transform it. The model that suggests ""Restart with another idea until one works"" may therefore lead to abandon projects as failures that are on the way to success.",1232372502

440422,comment,440149,440271,0,0,pavlov,,,"While it would be nice to have a fully open-source software stack on a phone, the EFF is campaigning for much more basic freedoms for American cell phone users.<p>In most places in the world, it's possible and very commonplace to buy a mobile phone separately from the network operator. The operator's only physical product is the SIM card, and consumers understand this. Even if you purchase a phone that's subsidised by the operator (which typically means making a fixed-rate contract for 24 months, so you end up repaying for the phone in full and you can't switch to another company with better rates), the operator has no control over the applications you install on the phone.<p>In the US, the operators apparently sell almost all phones through their own channels, which gives these companies the unusual power of being able to dictate the software that goes on the devices. Thus they can introduce locks and limitations into the software, and thanks to the DMCA, removing those limitations can be illegal.<p>I'm not American (and thus my understanding of the situation may be limited), but to me this seems to be a case where bad legislation has given a cartel of corporations excessive power over consumers. (It's somehow perverse that gigantic former European telemonopolies like Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are more open and competitive than their American equivalents, even though the former were essentially state-owned bureaucracies until the 1990s.)<p>Hopefully the DMCA exemption will persist, at least.",1232371666

What the VC paid for its investment is gone forever. All that is relevant is how they can maximize their investment at decision time. What multiple that works out to should be  utterly irrelevant.",1232371466

440417,comment,440149,440271,0,0,SingAlong,,,"Just a couple of years back, I really wanted to take a break from my web development stuff and buy an OpenMoko phone to develop something on it (and I couldn't afford one of my own). I thought it would really be cool to own one and mod it, and feel it would be cool even today. I hope they start giving student discounts or atleast release an SDK that would help develop for OpenMoko without the actual hardware.<p>Anyway, the FreeYourPhone campaign has some sense in it. But they could have instead gone the other way and brought together mobile platform developers and form a standard so that an app would work on every phone (yeah I know java does, but not an ""everybody supports"" standard). Atleast the core can be same. Something like linux. This way every app developer would be spending less time developing an app (since there would be much less porting job to be done) and have a larger reach. This also works for the customers since they would have a much larger app catalog to buy from.<p>Right now, all I can imagine is that if something like that happens then we would find people selling apps like how vegetables and clothes are sold now. Free-form retailership (anyone can sell apps). You could be competing with your friend if both you and your friend have your app stores. That would open up a new business opportunity. And very very good for small time app developers. Piracy is a problem, but maybe making the app a ""shame-ware"" can poke the user to pay if he likes it.

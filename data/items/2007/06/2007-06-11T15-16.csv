Even though I don't use it that much, but as an engineer concerned with usability, I always try to point our ""desktop people""'s attention at it.",1181575869
27253,comment,27228,27228,0,0,tx,,,"It's 2007 and smart people stopped separating ""desktop"" and ""online"" applications a long time ago, because it is pointless: the best approach to solving any problem is always picking the proper balance of server/desktop horsepower/capabilities. <p>Desktops are very powerful. People forget (or never realize) how powerful their computers are. For a long time only games have been taking advantage of all those millions of transistors. I <i>really</i> hope that next generation of browsers will start moving towards that direction. <p>For instance: if you have a flash movie occupying 100% of the page, it becomes simply unusable if a user maximizes the window, even on 1280x1024. Isn't that ridiculous? At our age and time, a simple 2D vector graphics plays at pathetic 5-7 frames per second... (even if he's got a $700 video card) And something tells me it's not entirely Macromedia/Adobe's fault.<p>It's changing, though. And Google/Microsoft are moving towards that direction. Good (early) example can be iTunes or apps built on GoogleGear platform.

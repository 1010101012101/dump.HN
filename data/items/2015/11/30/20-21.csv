I have read that part of the destabilization is down to mass movements of the urban poor into the cities in the years running up to the conflict.<p>And Saudi Arabia and other wealthy oil rich states clearly provide religious and armaments funding to support hardline interpretations of Islam, which means that the conflict between Shia and Sunni takes on a much more fundamentalist tone. That power arises from their wealth relative to other regions in the area.<p>As I say, I don&#x27;t think either of these things are particularly controversial. If we were talking about the rural poor moving into the cities in China, we wouldn&#x27;t have a problem talking about it as an issue of income inequality. It seems quite obvious that this is a major issue in a lot of the developing world (where income inequality tends to be far higher than in the West, particularly in resource rich countries).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say this has much relevance to policy in the developed world.

The author has some suggestions, but I think they work best for larger projects.<p>I&#x27;ve related this before, but I&#x27;ve had some super negative experiences with very entitled people.  One person was a professor for whom I continued to build stats software for 18 months after leaving university.  He actually repeatedly called me screaming when I was too busy to do some custom work for him on his timeframe.  After giving him 10+ hours a week of free work for a year and a half because I thought the software was interesting and I believed in the work the various labs were doing.<p>I also work on a bit of open source software that I wrote that implements a high performance (threaded and heavily beaten on with vtune) ml algorithm.<p>I think the solution, particularly for small projects or individuals, is to preemptively cut people off.  After many negative experiences, when I get bug reports or requests, if the reporter hasn&#x27;t put in a reasonable amount of work already, I just killfile the email address and move on with my life.  Even a small fraction of negative people was ruining any interest I had in working on my project: I&#x27;d open the tag in gmail, read a nasty or demanding email, and lose all motivation.<p>If people don&#x27;t preemptively respect my time, I have no use for them.

Aren&#x27;t you?  Let&#x27;s just pick.  If you had your hand on the tiller what areas would see YCR building in the short-term?<p>Rather than the one initial group, let&#x27;s say three announced research areas over the next three years.  Parsing Sam&#x27;s original post we know there&#x27;s $10mil.  $24mil is a good number for a roughly MIT Media Lab sized yearly budget.  We can assume efforts to bring on other investors and many external partners although most will likely be providing resources and pro bono services rather than direct investment.  Similarly, certain types of research will be better able to leverage YC&#x27;s infrastructure without incurring the cost of building, say, a synthetic biology lab.<p>Also consider that this is YC in terms of overall strategy.  Does this mean there is more or less likelihood to be proximal to current long-term research themes in SV?  It&#x27;s fascinating that multiple firms converge on things like flying networks infrastructure, VR, automotive, mapping tectonic, long-term futures on parallel lines.  Will YCR be in there?

Nonetheless, maybe I&#x27;m reading too much into it, but I&#x27;m getting a family vibe from roll-out strategy: a 10 person start, doing diligence with Alan Kay and the like thinking of the old and highly insular (in a good way) think tanks, reference to &#x27;projects&#x27; with 25 year horizons.

His support of Prop 8 and the legal ramifications of Prop 8, are the facts here.<p>> These personal beliefs could have been kept in a box in his mind, but when he spoke on this publicly and loudly as a public figure<p>So you&#x27;re only allowed to believe something if you don&#x27;t actually act on that belief in a way that internet stalkers can find? Hmm, hopefully there&#x27;s never an unpopular belief someone has that you would say is good, because they&#x27;ll decide to keep it to themselves instead of risking getting fired. I&#x27;m not sure his position was public or loud, at least not until people dragged it into public. All he did was donate, thus getting himself on a legally-required list of donors.<p>There could be dozens of employees at Mozilla, even some execs, who voted for Prop 8 (voting against gay marriage) but didn&#x27;t fund advocacy groups so that nobody knows. If Brendan Eich hadn&#x27;t donated but voted and if nobody thought to publicly ask his belief and got an honest answer, he would still be at Mozilla to this day, quietly oppressing employees and infecting the world with his anti-gay views through Firefox. Or not, because I haven&#x27;t heard any accounts of his political views actually entering the workplace until activists forced them to. To the public and to Mozilla employees, it was pretty much indistinguishable from &quot;kept in a box in his mind.&quot;",1448915937

There would be no iPhone without the investments in basic research and process that has done been done at IBM, Bell Labs, Intel, et al. When I worked at IBM, I couldn&#x27;t wait to read the next IBM Systems Journal, it was the only piece of &quot;corporate&quot; internal communications in any company I&#x27;ve ever worked for that I looked forward to. I worked at IBM T.J. Watson in the 90s and one of the things told to us during orientation is that our budget, and our research was separate and independent from the commercial divisions of IBM and we were free to work on stuff that wasn&#x27;t necessarily commercially viable.<p>Something rubs me the wrong way about this article and Apple&#x27;s R&D spending. R&D spending is wasteful, it is a gamble, but every once in a while, it produces something incredible that leads to a huge net positive externality for the world. Some of the greatest inventions were done on research no one ever thought would have any commercial usage. These days politicians decry studies on bear DNA, or Shrimps on Treadmills, but who&#x27;s to say these won&#x27;t be vitally important things 20 years from now?<p>Part of relying on the research advancements of others, standing on the shoulders of giants, IMHO, is to take your success and your profits, and invest them, continuing a kind of scientific &quot;social contract&quot; for those that come after you.<p>Hoarding profits and bragging about how you can get away with making lots of money without having to hire many researchers is IMHO, a kind of parasitical attitude.<p>On top of that, is the tendency of people to credit Apple for all advancements, even those that were tweaks on hard work done by others. Do I credit Apple for their graphics performance, or Microsoft, AMD, PowerVR, NVidia, SGI, and everyone else who over the past decade have invested massively into consumer 3D acceleration? Do I credit Apple for amazing battery improvements, or Intel or Samsung investments into NAND? Is the A9X more important than TSMC/Intel/Samsung fab innovations? Or IBM&#x27;s introduction of STM, Magnetic Storage, Eximer Lasers?<p>Science and Innovation are social endeavors relying on a community of shared progress. The secretive way Apple does R&D, their lack of publishing, and the way they promote this &#x27;lone genius/inventor&#x27; view of the company rubs me the wrong way. I&#x27;m not saying Apple hasn&#x27;t innovated, especially in mobile software, but won&#x27;t should brag about not doing basic research, and banking a hundred billion in offshore cash to be used for what, stock buybacks?<p>Just what is wrong with say, spending some of that money to fund research into say, quantum computing or medicine?

In my case, each individual GC was actually not that big a deal, but I was triggering them every few seconds. The GC would see a lot of large allocs, and then <i>successfully</i> clean them up, meaning that the next batch of large allocations would be seen as crossing the threshold again. My stats clearly showed that on this system, once I started pooling my []byte I never even filled up the memory pool itself, and my GCs plummeted so far that I wouldn&#x27;t even particularly care if they took half-a-second apiece anymore, which they don&#x27;t.

I wrote an email to several colleagues, which said, “Larry claims he wants to organize the world’s information, but his policy is creating clutter sites, muddling the world’s information.” I went on to imply that his policy was focused on increasing Google’s revenue rather than doing the right thing for users. (Nothing could have been further from the truth. I just didn’t understand what Larry was trying to achieve because, not surprisingly, he was about 15 steps ahead of me.)<p>If Larry had worked for me instead of co-founding the economic powerhouse of our century, I would never in a million years have sent such an arrogant, accusatory email. I would have asked him privately why he was proposing the policy when the results seemed to be in violation of Google’s mission. If I agreed with his rationale, that would have been that. If I disagreed, I would have explained, again privately, that he seemed inconsistent, and tried to understand his point of view. I didn’t do any of that.<p>Why did I behave this way? Partly because I believe there’s a special place in hell for those who “kick down and kiss up.”  At least I wasn’t making that mistake. But the main reason was that  I didn’t really think of Larry as a human being. I saw him as a kind of demigod whom I could attack with impunity. Just because there’s nothing more despicable than “kissing up” and “kicking down” doesn’t mean the opposite is admirable. This is so obvious that I feel ridiculous writing it. I’m sharing it here, though, because I hope that reading this story will help you avoid my mistake.<p>The clutter sites incident with Larry is a good example of how even well-intentioned  criticism can be obnoxiously aggressive if you don’t think of the person you’re criticizing as fully human.  The first problem with my email was that it wasn’t humble. I had just joined the company, and I didn’t understand much about how Google’s systems worked. Nor had I bothered to ask any questions about why Larry might be taking the stance he was taking.  Instead, I just made a bunch of assumptions and concluded (wrongly, as it turned out) that Larry was more concerned with making money than he was with Google’s mission.  Furthermore, my suggestion for how to address the policy issue was not helpful at all because I didn’t really understand the problem that Larry was trying to solve.  My other miscalculation was criticizing Larry in a public forum, rather than in private, which would have been the respectful thing to do.  And I personalized. I impugned his character by accusing him  of hypocrisy. Lesson learned!<p>So, remember you are talking to a person. Find something about that person that is interesting to you. There are people in your life you care about. Apply what you know about those personal relationships to your work relationships. Work relationships are not friendships, but they are still relationships. When you’re challenging somebody who knows you care, that person will likely take your criticism in the “right way,” even if you say it the “wrong way.”  Be “kind,” but don’t just try to to be “nice.”  The problem with all the “how to say it nicely” advice out there is that it can make you sound insincere.  If you say it “nicely,” but don’t genuinely give a damn about the person, they’ll see through you every time. You’ll look and feel like you’re kissing ass...Another thing you can do is to be open to criticism yourself.  Remember, you may not have full context, and you may be wrong.<p>Also, here is some more about what I mean by radical candor being HIP (Humble, Helpful, Immediate, In person, Private criticism / Public praise, do not Personalize). What follows are some additional thoughts on what that means. But, please don’t let the additional thoughts or the acronym paralyze you. Whatever you do, don’t sit there saying nothing trying to remember what I stands for. For the vast majority of people, the really important thing is to just say what you think.",1448915380

I&#x27;ve also read countless forums (Corporette posts[1], the excellent Ask A Manager[2] blog, Laurie Ruettimann [3] that talk specifically about workplace psychology in a non-clinical way.<p>The hiring manager likes to think they are not biased, but they always are, in the same way all humans are.  Be it by names in resumes [4], or because employees experience a &quot;cultural mismatch&quot;, we are imperfect as humans and will judge a person just as much as we judge credentials or resumes.<p>The best hiring managers will recognize that this is a Thing That Exists and try to actively overcome these biases. But the world is not made up of best hiring managers. It is made up of people who may or may not assume that because you are pregnant you will not do as much work, or they don&#x27;t want to give you leave or deal with FMLA, or they don&#x27;t want to deal with you potentially not coming back after your leave is over.<p>This is a constant fear for women, this fear of being judged on our childbearing potential, and comes up over and over again in both motherhood forums and professional work forums, as well as more recently in the national conversation with the likes of Lean In, Anna Marie Slaughter, and others.<p>I&#x27;ve had conversations with women who are worried that they should remove their engagement and wedding ring in case the employer sees it and assumes the woman is newly married and wants to have children right away, ruining the amount of time she might put into the career. Other women are terrified of losing their jobs after coming back from a maternity leave where men or non-pregnant coworkers handle all of the business and they suddenly feel they are not needed.<p>To anyone unfamiliar with how hiring and workplace psychology work, these concerns seem far-fetched. To many women working today, they are an unfortunate reality, although one that doesn&#x27;t exist everywhere and is starting to shift, hopefully, with things like an increasing number of more flexible parental leave policies.<p>So, don&#x27;t mention anything until you&#x27;re far along enough in the process that it&#x27;s time for both parties to evaluate whether they want to work with each other (i.e. the offer stage).

10651393,comment,10614592,10614592,0,0,joeharris76,,,"We&#x27;ve struggled with the same issues. We also keep a &quot;base&quot; schema in Redshift as a close mirror to source systems (tweaked a little for distribution keys). In our case we control the extracts but schema changes have to be manually added. If a new column is important and we miss it then we have to run time consuming backfills. Then only way we&#x27;ve been able to ameliorate it somewhat is to be more involved in the upstream release process but that is time consuming in itself.<p>The solution I&#x27;d like to implement is having the extracts and loads be built dynamically whenever a change is detected. E.g. have a process that runs separately checking the schema of our sources for changes, dynamically updating the ETL processes and then publishing them to Azkaban. Looking forward though our biggest data sources are going non-relational so that approach will entail a great deal more complexity.<p>Regarding schema knowledge / metadata, this is a perennial problem. I once worked on a huge Teradata DW system at a global bank who had a large internal website for just this purpose which was hugely out of date at all times.<p>When I started building out the analytic capability at my current company I made a fork of &quot;Rocco&quot; (<a href=""https://github.com/joeharris76/rocco"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joeharris76/rocco</a>) for doing inline documentation as Markdown inside SQL block comments. <a href=""http://pow.cx/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pow.cx/docs/</a> is a good example of what I was hoping to achieve. However even our smallest components have many, many files and the docs were too difficult to navigate using the &quot;Jump To…&quot; dropdown menu.<p>So, while this produces some very nice docs, sadly they turned out to be largely unhelpful to anyone who didn&#x27;t already understand the code. Our current approach is to try and keep individual components small, include a comprehensive README in each component and use Slack comms to fill in the gaps.",1448913729

If I were to go kinda far out on the crazy idea scale, I would consider borrowing something from the indie video game world; you can do a lot of setting the tone of a long series of text snippets by recording high quality voice samples. Once we have the sense from high-quality voice acting, we can fill in the gaps from there. It might be interesting to experiment with pairing the book with a presentation given on the first chapter in video form, which would then set the tone for the rest of the book. (I think people, rather understandably, have a lot of preexisting emotion they are bringing to this topic, and it may be worth taking extra steps to try to defuse it, so you have a chance of communicating your points.)<p>Crazy thought, anyhow.",1448913662

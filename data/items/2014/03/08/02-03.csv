7364071,comment,7362327,7364008,2,0,stormbrew,,,"Consider the other direction from Java, into the fully dynamic languages. Many of those give you even less ability to control heap vs. stack allocations than Java does and often present an everything-is-a-reference facade even on things that are often optimized to stack objects (Fixnum in Ruby for eg).<p>But yes, a java programmer with embedded or native background would have a better understanding of this than people who learned Java first, which is what I&#x27;m really addressing here. And in the OP on SE you can clearly see that this is a big part of that person&#x27;s confusion.",1394247528
7364070,comment,7360011,7360011,3,0,tgholford,,,"Interesting.<p>High speed aircraft can generate enough lift to fly just with the fuselage.  Wings are really only needed for take-off and landing at low speeds.<p>You will notice that the F-15 pilot said he landed at high speed, 250 knots or so.<p>The F-14 Tomcat, F-111, and B-1 bomber have swing wings, which extend on take-off but retract for high-speed flight.  The F-14’s wing sweep has a computer control mode so that the wing sweep angle can change dynamically while the plane is maneuvering.<p>There are lots of stories about airplanes missing wings.<p>One of my instructors in flight training was  flying an F-11 Tiger, and lost both wings during a high-G maneuver.  He said that he noticed that the controls got “mushy”.  In a lot of jets, the horizontal tail surfaces can angle up or down independently and replace the “ailerons” normally on the wing outer edges.  He reported a problem to the tower and did a fly-by.  They told him his wings were gone.  I don’t know if he landed or ejected.<p>There have been numerous documented incidents where planes have launched from carriers with the wings folded.  I know of cases where this has happened with A-1 and F-4 type aircraft.<p>When I was in the Mediterranean, I saw an F-4 land on the carrier with an outer wing panel (beyond the fold line) hanging straight down after a collision with a Russian Bear bomber.<p>I also saw an A-6 land at Naples air facility with a missing outer wing panel as a result of a collision somewhere over the Med.<p>The F-15 video was pretty impressive.  It really shows how much lift is generated by the fuselage, and how at some point, the wings don’t provide any lift but are just pure drag.<p>If you have enough thrust, you don’t need any wings at all.  But then it’s not an “airplane” but a rocket.",1394247525

7364060,comment,7353763,7363900,1,0,dalke,,,"C++ doesn&#x27;t have unknown types, so we&#x27;re working with different definitions. Here&#x27;s an example:<p><pre><code>    [xebulon:~/tmp] dalke% cat tmp.cc\n    #include <iostream>\n    \n    template<typename T>\n    int f(T s) {\n     return s ? 2 : 0;\n    }\n    \n    main() {\n      std::cout << &quot;int 0 &quot; << f(0) << std::endl;\n      std::cout << &quot;int 8 &quot; << f(8) << std::endl;\n      std::cout << &quot;float 0.0 &quot; << f(0.0) << std::endl;\n      std::cout << &quot;float -1.0 &quot; << f(-1.0) << std::endl;\n    }\n    [xebulon:~/tmp] dalke% g++ tmp.cc\n    [xebulon:~/tmp] dalke% ./a.out \n    int 0 0\n    int 8 2\n    float 0.0 0\n    float -1.0 2\n</code></pre>\nThe function f() doesn&#x27;t know the type, but its instantiation for f(0) (integer) and f(0.0) float know the type.<p>C++ containers don&#x27;t have a bool (or at least vector<> doesn&#x27;t). For one, until C++11 there was no &quot;explicit operator bool&quot;, and a simple &quot;operator bool&quot; was too permissive because of implicit type conversion. C++11 introduced a more contextual conversion to bool.<p>More and more components have explicit bool support. For example, <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.htm#conversions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/smart_ptr/shared_p...</a> ?<p><pre><code>    Notes: This conversion operator allows shared_ptr objects to be\n    used in boolean contexts, like if(p && p->valid()) {}.\n\n    [The conversion to bool is not merely syntactic sugar. It allows shared_ptrs\n    to be declared in conditions when using dynamic_pointer_cast\n    or weak_ptr::lock.]\n</code></pre>\nand <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/operator_bool"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/operator_...</a> .<p>I do not track C++ well enough to go into any more depth than this, especially as it concerns the history and future.<p>I like to say &quot;if x: ...&quot; and not &quot;if len(x) == 0:&quot; in order to check if a dictionary is empty.<p>Following Scheme, I can understand that something like &quot;if empty(x)&quot; might be more explicit. But I have a decent amount of code where I do something like:<p><pre><code>   def process(a, rename=None):\n     if rename:\n       a = [rename.get(x, x) for x in a]\n     ... do things with a ...\n</code></pre>\nIn this toy example, &quot;rename=None&quot; indicates that there is no renaming dictionary, and using {} as the renaming dictionary won&#x27;t rename anything, so the &quot;if rename&quot; tests for both conditions correctly.<p>Without bool, I could write it as:<p><pre><code>     if rename is not None:\n</code></pre>\nsince using the empty dictionary in this case is okay, but if I want the slight extra performance for the empty dictionary case I would have to write it:<p><pre><code>     if rename is not None and not empty(rename):\n</code></pre>\nI think that would grow tedious.<p>BTW, I don&#x27;t use &quot;def process(a, rename={}):&quot; because that is one of Python anti-patterns: the default values are constant over the life of the function, so<p><pre><code>    def something(a, b={}):\n      b[a] = a\n      return b\n</code></pre>\nwill accumulate to b rather than create a new dictionary each time. Thus, seeing a &quot;={}&quot; or &quot;=[]&quot; in a parameter list demands closer inspection because it often leads to errors.",1394247251

One has to consider the trajectory the company is going on, how likely it is it will continue on this trajectory, when things will plateau, etc. You can&#x27;t just say &quot;its not making money therefore it is a sell.&quot; Well you can, but you won&#x27;t be a very good growth investor. You might be one of the many people that refused to buy google at $100 because their P/E was insanely high.<p>Looking at COUP&#x27;s S1 I can say a couple of nice things about them. They are showing good topline growth. Their gross margins are expanding. Their net margins (while negative) are improving very fast. From 2012 to 2013 they grew their revenues by almost 50% while they actually reduced their operating expenses. But most importantly, their revenue growth is accelerating.<p>If they continue posting higher and higher revenue growth and expanding growth margins, they may start gushing money in a couple of years.<p>As I said they are not for me. I am not sure they can continue high revenue growth for long because they do not seem to have a good lasting competitive advantage. But I can see how someone may be convinced to buy them.",1394245558

He should report to a division president or higher.<p>Strong but small project offices must be provided both by the military and industry.<p>The number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner. Use a small number of good people (10% to 25% compared to the so-called normal systems).<p>A very simple drawing and drawing release system with great flexibility for making changes must be provided.<p>There must be a minimum number of reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly.<p>There must be a monthly cost review covering not only what has been spent and committed but also projected costs to the conclusion of the program. Don&#x27;t have the books 90 days late, and don&#x27;t surprise the customer with sudden overruns.<p>The contractor must be delegated and must assume more than normal responsibility to get good vendor bids for subcontract on the project. Commercial bid procedures are very often better than military ones.<p>The inspection system as currently used by the Skunk Works, which has been approved by both the Air Force and Navy, meets the intent of existing military requirements and should be used on new projects. Push more basic inspection responsibility back to subcontractors and vendors. Don&#x27;t duplicate so much inspection.<p>The contractor must be delegated the authority to test his final product in flight. He can and must test it in the initial stages. If he doesn&#x27;t, he rapidly loses his competency to design other vehicles.<p>The specifications applying to the hardware must be agreed to well in advance of contracting. The Skunk Works practice of having a specification section stating clearly which important military specification items will not knowingly be complied with and reasons therefore is highly recommended.<p>Funding a program must be timely so that the contractor doesn&#x27;t have to keep running to the bank to support government projects.<p>There must be mutual trust between the military project organization and the contractor with very close cooperation and liaison on a day-to-day basis. This cuts down misunderstanding and correspondence to an absolute minimum.<p>Access by outsiders to the project and its personnel must be strictly controlled by appropriate security measures.<p>Because only a few people will be used in engineering and most other areas, ways must be provided to reward good performance by pay not based on the number of personnel supervised.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Johnson_(engineer)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Johnson_(engineer)</a>",1394244713

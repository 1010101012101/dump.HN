This is where the whole idea of wiki's started - and if you only know the term from Wikipedia, there's quite a bit to learn.<p>In the end, a lot of everyone's network usage boils down to two bits: information and communication. Just having that actor you forgot the name of at your fingertip, or quickly looking up the detailed history of literacy is just great. This is what Hitchhiker's Guide promised. Nowadays some people probably have a hard time thinking about what they'd do in those cases without their mobile devices, but considering that previously you had to go to your encyclopedia, probably find it inadequate and then head to the library, even for rather trivial use…<p>For communication, we sadly left the more interesting technology behind and now are shoe-horning everything into the web. Which is why I'd find a hard time calling any kind of forum, whether it's a PHPBB one, reddit or HN ""great"". A wiki probably comes closest to actually using the web to its advantage - and if remember correctly, user-editable pages for almost everything were part of the original WWW idea.

Don't rebase once you've published.<p>Rebase is a tool for reasoning about your changes as a collection of logical transformations. It's to help you prepare a patch to share with the team. Interactive rebasing (and squashing, fixups, etc) are there to let you checkpoint your work as you go and to give you the freedom to come back and reason about your patches later.<p>Once I got comfortable with rebase, I began using it as a tool to help me write code. By that I don't mean putting characters into a text file. I mean teasing out isolated changes without interrupting the flow of bigger tasks.<p>The fear of rebase comes from people who are used to centralized version control systems. They view their version control system as a tool for backups and accountability. Git provides sha1 hashes for backups/security/accountability. Everything else git does is to help you write, reason about, communicate about, share, separate, combine, and otherwise fiddle with patches as logical changes.<p>If you don't want people to rewrite history, don't give them push access to your repository. Everyone has their own, right? If you want to prevent people from <i>accidentally</i> rewriting canonical history, disable --force pushes to your team's shared repository using a pre-commit hook.

If you want to make sure your system behaves ""correctly"" under arbitrary partitioning, you necessarily have to admit the trivial cases.

""Eventual consistency"" is a b.s. marketing term that actually has nearly no meaning.<p>The easiest way to see just how empty the definition is, is by negating it and seing what undesirable property a system would have to have in order to fail to be eventually consistent. Take the definition from wikipedia:<p>""Given a sufficiently long period of time over which no changes are sent, all updates can be expected to propagate eventually through the system and all the replicas will be consistent.""<p>Negation:<p>""No matter how long you wait without sending changes, updates may not propagate through the system, and disagreement may continue to exist between replicas indefinitely.""<p>So basically, saying that something is ""eventually consistent"" just means ""we won't completely ignore you forever"".

Revenues have been doubling every year with the growth rate increasing. Low single digit millions in revenue. Company is profitable. I'd have to take a ~30% paycut.<p>Startup 2: Very successful company, close to $500M in revenue, relatively small eng org of about 50 people. Being offered an eng lead position reporting to the CTO.

906096,comment,904018,906033,0,0,wvenable,,,"When I started my last big project it was several years ago and PHP5 had just been released.  I had been doing PHP for many years before that (since PHP3 -- moved from Perl to ASP to PHP).  At the same time I've been doing desktop and mobile development in C++, VB, and C#.  I also keep up with Python and other tools to see how things are progressing.<p>So I needed to start up a new project those years ago and it really wasn't the best time to learn another language. Ruby and Python were still a bit lame in the web space at that time.  I'm not even sure Rails was out at the time; and if it was it was really new.  I definitely didn't need to start a massive project on something that was very much untested.  Performance and stability are also factors.<p>You are entitled to your opinion, but I don't find PHP to be all that painful.  I've built up a large body of code and, more specifically, a coding style that makes PHP as productive to me as most other languages.  For example, all my objects inherit from a root Object class that provides automatic properties: declare a method as setFoo and you use $object->foo = 'hello' to call it.  My framework library is very modular and uses the autoload facility.  I have a template library that is like smarty only less weird (and much less code).  I have a few different database abstractions for different needs.  Entity objects that can be loaded and saved.  Classes for quick inline queries (similar to what you've used in other examples).  An an abstraction for larger more complex SQL queries.  In addition to basic templating for the UI, I also have something akin to ASP.NET user controls so I can built up complex forms just by adding tags to the template.  The UI is connected end-to-end with the database so load, save, and validation is automatically generated (including client-side javascript) from a description of the data.  I can push about a CRUD page in minutes.<p>So really, I have lots of reasons besides ignorance to stick with PHP at this point.  Now, if I had to start the project again now, I'd have re-evaluate all my options but it would have to weighted against the body of code and knowledge I already have.  I won't claim that PHP is better than any other language -- but it's really not as bad as you make it out to be.  Just look at all the things that are possible in it!",1256669987

This isn't trying to be a wiseass; i find this actually has some great effects.  I've found teaching go has to be a student-driven process to be successful; the onus is on the student to generate questions, and, to go another step, the student must seek & have the experiences that will generate the questions.  This almost always means playing go for yourself.<p>This implies that the student has already conquered a lot of (very real) internal fears; the fear of performing incompetently, the fear of being thought dumb.  The fear of failure, basically.  An interesting thing to run across on a blog for entrepreneurs.<p>The saddest part about that article was that so many of those sentences are ""I"" sentences; you write ""I feel"" this, ""i think"" that, ""I am [x], i won't be [y], i will never be [z]"".  Even the comments about your friend are defined in terms of yourself.  The problem is that probably no one else is as concerned about your performance as you are.<p>This is something that could be incredibly liberating from the right perspective.  Who is judging you here?  Not your friend, certainly!  It's not a reflection on your character unless you make it one -- and you don't have to make it one.<p>Your conclusions at the end are <i>so close!</i>\n""The courage to play incompetently is a cure for fear of incompetence""\nthis is true, but it's almost a tautology.  Perhaps a more useful formulation is this:\n""The courage to play incompetently is a cure for incompetence.""  Maybe it is the only cure.<p>Relax, enjoy, & Dare To Suck -- your performance at something you've never done is not and will not be used as a measurement of your worth as a person.  That gift of ""curiousity & fearlessness"" is not a personality trait; people get nervous when they feel like they're being judged.  You're not -- at least, not by anyone but yourself.<p>See also: <a href=""http://senseis.xmp.net/?FearOfLosing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://senseis.xmp.net/?FearOfLosing</a>\nand the go proverb ""lose your first 100 games as quickly as you can""<p>relax & good luck<p>-seigenblues<p>P.S.

906060,comment,905762,905983,0,0,vsiva68,,,"Yes, I've read the book, and I would recommend it. The book makes multiple claims: The first is that given the proper environment (physical & mental fitness), we can run very long distances. This I think it proves very well with the Tarahumara tribe example.<p>It then goes on to make the claim that humans evolved to run long distances, in order to do persistence hunting. Persistence hunting is basically outrunning an animal for long distances so that it just drops down because it is tired. While persistence hunting itself exists, it is a stretch to say that this is how humans evolved.<p>The Ardi discovery that made news a few months ago shows that Ardi's environment was not really the savannah, but something that had far more trees. Persistence hunting requires a savannah like environment.<p>In the end, all I'm saying is that it is ok to say that humans can run long distances, but saying humans evolved to do that is far trickier and requires a lot more proof. The scientists involved in the Ardi discovery do not make any claims at all (after 15 years of studying fossils in one region). They are far more humble, and say that many different scenarios are possible.<p>Popular book writers on the other hand have to explain things to a lay audience, and usually provide one point of view (which typically fits their own mental model).

I'm the author of that cartoon, and was delighted to see your reply. Thanks!<p>Certainly, a bottle of water is harmless, but I was actually assuming the water bottle was also an explosive.<p>Laptop batteries have relatively high energy density. The two batteries I travel with (which I've never had anyone object to, contrary to your stated policy) combine to hold roughly the same energy in a 6-oz bottle of pure nitroglycerine. This energy cannot all be released quite as rapidly, but my friends have made laptop batteries explode with enough violence to, in one test, take the top off a small tree (when nestled in a fork of the trunk).<p>I understand that practicality plays into the decision of what to ban, and the joke of the comic was mainly how silly it would be to explain to a security guard how you could make a bomb with the expectation that it would have a good outcome.

You can make a bang big enough to kill a plane with laptop batteries - the fact you can make a <i>bigger</i> bang with liquids is surely irrelevant. And also it's perfectly possible to change the contents of a battery - no? So put something more explosive in it....<p>Batteries are very easy to remove.<p>The <i>reason</i> liquids were banned is because of the evidence someone came up with the suggest there were liquid bombs being planned (and I think one failed attempt) - not a bad response at all! It's the same reason a lot of airports (especially UK ones) ask you to remove your shoes and Xray them.<p>At the end of the day they can only respond to the perceived or suspected risks - if you <i>really</i> put your mind too it it shouldnt actually be too hard to smuggle a bomb on a plane.<p>EDIT: by which I mean it is more a case of making people feel safe (by inconveniencing them, basic psycology) as well as causing more inconvenience for a small number of possible potential attacks. The actual security effect is fairly minimal - simply for practical reasons pointed out a billion times over.",1256667257

Unless, of course, you are implying that anyone who makes that statement has already tried and failed at creating successful video games and are now doomed and hopeless before they even hit the campus floor (as I am assuming that teenage girl is because, well...her poems suck).<p>I wanted to make video games. I went to a school specifically for that. I made it halfway through. The reality (to me, at least) was that the industry was just not worth it. The average lifespan of a game developer is 5 years...before total burnout ensues, and you are left entirely drained, hopefully with some bank though. But above all that, I decided to drop out because of a very simple and fundamental reason: It took all the mystery out of games...the X-factor, if you will.<p>This is not just refined to games of course...I feel that this happens all over the place, and the simplest answer as to why could just be that we as humans LOVE to learn.

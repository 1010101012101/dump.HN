If the system follows (simple) rules then you can likely compress the description of the system into something that fits into a (small) subsystem. If the system and its behavior is a uncompressible mess this will not work out. Up to now, I would say, our universe with all its relatively simple laws of physics looks pretty structured and easily compressible.",1420232390
8828515,comment,8827123,8827123,0,0,trcollinson,,,"I&#x27;d like to spin this conversation around a bit. Here is where I would be concerned if I ever wanted to work with you:<p>You are a contractor who normally charges $150 an hour. You have an inside lead into a potential contract for a company in distress on a project and you know how to complete the work. You believe that your time in this case is actually worth way more than $150 (66% more) and you would like help in getting additional money for your services.<p>First, you assume there is no risk in writing the software up front and then charging for it. I have had many contracts &quot;in the bag&quot; that turned out to be not so sure after all. You are taking on the risk of writing the software before talking to the client (read: the person who actually pays you a check). This is troublesome, especially for something as short as a 100 hour contract.<p>Second, this is a 100 hour contract, or so you estimate. Is that really worth the upfront risk of writing it early? I guess you could argue that &quot;it&#x27;s only 100 hours! Not 10,000, so it&#x27;s no risk at all.&quot; Well, to me that&#x27;s a $15,000 risk at your rate.<p>Third, you say that the additional value associated with charging $250 instead of $150 is in the fact that your solution will save them money on operations costs for years to come. While you are probably very right, it will save them money for years to come, isn&#x27;t that what we all strive for? To make the most efficient running code possible that ultimately saves the client time and money? Would you ever say something like this &quot;Well for $250 an hour I can write code that runs more efficiently, but for $150 an hour I will only write code that squeaks by on the most expensive hardware possible&quot;?<p>So, if I were in your spot I would not write the solution up front. I would definitely go in and sell them on your solution at your normal, $150/hr, rate with a pleasant but straight forward presentation and good reference. I would explain to them that you are charging your normal rate because it is fair and that others might charge them more because of there situation and that you will be fair and honest with your time and their money. I would estimate the time needed to complete the project then I would get it done and deliver it on time. 100 hours is about 2.5 weeks.<p>Then you will get paid $15,000 AND you will get something more. You will get a really happy client who will need more work, improvements on what you just made, and be a fantastic reference for your other clients. If all goes well, your name will be passed around to their clients all over the place. That is worth way more than a few $1000 extra in fees.",1420232366

And loves them perhaps a bit too much in the sense that any entertainment medium is, at its heart, a <i>fashion</i> medium, and fashions change.<p>I agree with him that franchises get boring, but he seems to miss the part where I, the movie-goer, stop going to movies and so the studios notice and stop making them and try to make something else. My daughter and I were noting that all the TV shows seemed to be police procedurals with a police officer and a &quot;quirky side kick&quot; of some sort. That concept got run right into the ground. And now all of them are &#x27;Game of Thrones&#x27; clones where their is some nominal &quot;set&quot; and within that set are created no fewer than a dozen inter-twined story lines of competition and intrique. And because they want to have a dozen or more story lines, many of them are just plain silly.<p>My point is that it sucks when something you love moves on from what you love into something new[1].

Which would be a pretty interesting phenomenon to discuss all by itself, artistically speaking (thinking of the <i>alien invasion</i> movies of the 1950s, which were similar in nature), only if everything wouldn&#x27;t be so grotesque because of the huge sums of money involved.<p>As a film buff myself I really do hope that Hollywood will manage to turn itself around. In the 1970s it got very lucky because of the Nouvelle Vague French directors, who influenced the early movies of Lucas, Spielberg or Scorsese, the guys who created the new Hollywood, but this time around I don&#x27;t see any bright prospects. The European or Asian <i>independent</i> and artsy films are mostly only created to be showed in film festivals and to receive government money, while former huge and influential movie industries like the ones from Japan (think Kurosawa or K. Fukasaku) or Hong Kong are virtually dead. Very sad state of affairs.",1420232226

8828483,comment,8828155,8828155,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"Allow me to introduce my client, the devil. I&#x27;ll be representing him in the following few bullet points. Mainly as an intellectual exercise, but hopefully, a worthwhile exercise.<p>- First: This is a very thoughtful and well-written article, and it raises some very valid points. Sequelmania is a creatively bankrupt strategy in the long run. (That being said, I&#x27;m a big fan of what Marvel has been able to do with its franchises, and I&#x27;m not convinced that its films are the sort of anti-creative schlock it&#x27;s become trendy to describe them as. Full disclosure: a good friend is fairly high up the food chain at Marvel, and he&#x27;s a brilliant and awesome exec.)<p>- Second: It&#x27;s also a monetarily lucrative strategy. More important, it&#x27;s a de-risking strategy. One sees the same pattern in the video games industry, where the decision to churn out <i>Call of Duty 327.5</i> is a no-brainer, destined to reap at least a billion dollars in revenue, and the decision to make a daring, idiosyncratic, artful, niche game is liable to get a studio head fired.<p>- Third: In the good old days, studios were a total mess. They took wild swings in profitability, their shareholders were often fleeced, and their executives lived high on the hog. This was generally accepted as the cost of doing business in a creatively driven industry. Today, not <i>too</i> much has changed: but the execs currently in power are much more adept at managing brands and franchises. They&#x27;re also better businesspeople (with some notable exceptions). This is actually a good thing, if you&#x27;re a shareholder in a movie studio.<p>- Fourth: About those shareholders. Over the last 20-odd years, and especially over the last decade, Hollywood has received more and more investment capital from hedge funds and i-banks. What do finance guys want to see? For one thing, the books. &quot;Hollywood accounting&quot; is actually on the wane, and that&#x27;s a good thing. They also want to see results. ROI. Predictable ROI, if at all possible. This goal often stands at odds with free-reined creativity and risk-taking, with plenty of the unfortunate consequences that the author points out. But it also forces studios to think more like businesses, and less like social clubs. Executives should be held accountable for their financial results, not their popularity at Soho House.<p>- Fifth: The indie film, the risky film, the daringly trashy film, and the eccentric film are far from dead. Big studios aren&#x27;t making them anymore, but as means of production and distribution continue to democratize, <i>especially</i> at the small-time level, you&#x27;ll see more and more true indies step in to fill this gap in the market. My off-the-cuff prediction: big studios double down on the franchise business—which, when you think about it, is probably what a &quot;big&quot; studio <i>should</i> be focusing on. Little and mid-sized players, in addition to foreign players, focus on the niche and arthouse fare. Globalization, plus interesting new distribution technology, allows these players to punch above their weight as never before.<p>- Sixth: By <i>FAR</i> the best combination creative/business executive Hollywood has had in my lifetime was Michael Eisner. This guy gets a lot of shit for the whole Michael Ovitz debacle at Disney, and it&#x27;s tarnished his legacy considerably. But he almost singlehandedly revitalized and rebuilt the Disney machine. Disney is the Apple of the movie business, and he was (kinda sorta) its Steve Jobs. (Steve Jobs himself was later involved in Disney, as we know.) He had his misses, as well as his hits. But he&#x27;s the sort of exec Hollywood needs more of, not less. Its development and production aspects should be run by creative executives, and its overall business units should be run by true business executives. Whenever the twain shall meet--very rarely--these people should run the shop. I&#x27;d love to say that Hollywood selects for combination creative-business people, but it doesn&#x27;t. It selects for good politicians on the creative side, and good bean-counters on the business side. It needs to rethink its talent-cultivation pipeline, and I&#x27;d be lying if I said I knew where to begin.",1420231948

I can&#x27;t deny the &quot;technical quality&quot; of his work, but eventually you watch enough sci-fi and realize that while of course everyone pulls heavily from their predecessors, Whedon takes the kitchen sink.  Dollhouse was the breaking point for me, both in terms of it being a weak, less predictive imitation of RuR, and the fact that at the end of the day, he has a pattern.  He has good actors for that pattern, but you see them enough times and seeing them more times isn&#x27;t really adding to anything.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of noise about mourning the death of sci-fi/cinema etc, but the gems have always been the outliers.  Metropolis and later Dark City, Delicatessen/City of Lost Children, Firefly(yes, I&#x27;ll give him that one, outlaw star has some things to say, but that plot trope was already as old as the Romans.), Primer, Dark Mirror, 
I&#x27;m rambling at this point and this is totally going to spawn another sci fi binge, but my takeaway is that there&#x27;s been a reasonable stream of surprisingly good sci fi that has popped up in unpredictable places over the years, even into the torrent era.  I have some faith it will continue to bubble to the top.  My theory is that the only reason good sci fi seems so rare now is that it has become so swamped by bad sci fi as it has begun to fill the mainstream.",1420231935

Presumably people should favor the ones written by the original author, because they would expect it to be more true to the spirit that they liked in the earlier works. However, if some people prefer to read works by competing authors, then that would be good for them, and too bad for Martin. The notion of being able to assess property rights over a universe of fiction (beyond the original copyright interpretation of ownership of the actual work and adaptations of the work <i>in its fixed form</i>) are a new and dangerous notion, I think.<p>Lots of artistic creativity is discouraged or impossible today because of the unclear legal status of fan fiction, or of works that are inspired by another work but cannot afford to pay a license for them.

Certainly, there&#x27;s some serious cash cows there, and some of the franchise movies are mediocre movies. But they&#x27;re no more or less mediocre than the all-original movies that filled the production slots before them. There&#x27;s about a hundred movies released by the major studios a year; How many can you name from any given year? Five? Ten?<p>What franchises represent, to me, is the new search for continuity. The world is changing faster, relationships are getting more tenuous. Moving around, finding new friends, new places to hang out and eat and drink and be merry; All these things have been enabled by the internet and the sharing economy. I moved to a new town about 3 months ago, I eat out every night and I&#x27;ve eaten at precisely two places twice: A korean joint I like because it&#x27;s named for Psy&#x27;s masterpiece, and an indian place a former coworker recommended. The rest of the time, I&#x27;ve been trying new things, searching for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; meal, never satisfied. In this search for novelty, something has been lost.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why you see so many tumblr handles of the form &#x27;harrypotterlover21&#x27; and &#x27;twilightfan32&#x27;. People identify with these stories and universes, and find their sense of connection and emotional stability with them. It&#x27;s no longer specific people that you have a connection with, but a grouping based on a shared interest; perhaps one that belies a mindset?<p>It ties into, as well, the current trend of TV shows to be long-form entertainment. We want to see characters grow and establish themselves. 1 1/2 hours isn&#x27;t long enough. 3 hours rarely is. Franchises allow stories to be told iteratively. That&#x27;s a good thing for movies and art. There&#x27;s nothing special about the traditional runtime for a film that makes it more artistic; that&#x27;s just how long humans are willing to sit down and focus on one thing at a time.",1420231680

Here&#x27;s one example:<p>Using:<p><pre><code>    size_t len = strlen(myString);
    for (int i=0; i<len; ++len) { ... }
</code></pre>
Over:<p><pre><code>    for (int i=0; i<strlen(myString); ++len) { ... }
</code></pre>
The second for loop is potentially O(n^2) because strlen needs to scan the entire string every time through the loop, where the first for loop computes strlen once.  It&#x27;s possible the compiler can optimize so that only one strlen is used in the second case, but it&#x27;s not guaranteed.  Probably it doesn&#x27;t matter, but it will start to slow down once this function is called with longer strings and/or inside tight loops.<p>They&#x27;re almost the same, so why ever use the slower one?<p>And C++ is even worse with destructors and copy and move constructors being called all over the place for people who aren&#x27;t careful.",1420231647

Three vim plugins made me return: git-gutters, you-complete-me (ycm), and clang-format.<p>It is hard to extend vim&#x27;s functionality. Its plugin interface has issues. Because of that, ycm and git-gutters can not be used at the same time, and something that ought to be straightforward like exposing clang&#x27;s autocomplete information requires a considerable engineering effort (ycm) spanning three languages and about as much code as vis is total.<p>Giving vis good extensibility would be easier than fixed vim&#x27;s plugin interface (sorry neovim). My personal preference for doing this would be a patch to vis that adds vim like gutters and dropdowns, and then patches that require this one and add specific things like ycm and git-gutters.

Off the top of my head - this depends hugely on the task at hand.

Even within the same task, different phases of the task require different amounts of communication - when you are whiteboarding the design of a particular library, constant feedback is exceptionally useful.  When it&#x27;s time to sit down and write difficult code involving pointer math, constantly discussing things will just throw you off.<p>I am sure there was some proper science done behind that number - but that number refers to teams of a certain size, working on a specific task, in a given context (I would also be curious to know the C.I. on that 35% too).

</code></pre>
without having to hoist the subexpression out.<p>> My support for this claim is only anecdotal; it comes from working with programs written in Racket, which has both implicit return values and a strong convention of returning void from imperative procedures.<p>Yeah, that makes sense.

(Think of how atomic theory made sense of the elements, or how nuclear physics explained how the sun could shine for so long, or how the unification of electricity and magnetism miraculously turned out to explain optics as well.) So I was convinced that we would someday find a fundamental theory that would be able to <i>predict</i> things like the fine structure constant or the charge to mass ratio of the electron.<p>But eventually someone pointed out that before we understood the history and nature of the solar system, natural philosophers looked for similarly deep explanations for the orbits of the planets. Kepler once proposed a deep connection between the (five) gaps between the six known planets and the five platonic solids (see, e.g. <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2011/12/beautiful-losers-keplers-harmonic-spheres/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2011/12/beautiful...</a>), and Bode&#x27;s law for planetary orbits was widely accepted until Neptune was discovered in the &quot;wrong&quot; place in 1846 (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titius%E2%80%93Bode_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titius%E2%80%93Bode_law</a>).<p>Today, we understand that there is no reason to expect any particular pattern of planetary orbits: solar systems are a dime a dozen in the galaxy, and their details are accidents of history. So while I don&#x27;t like the idea, I&#x27;ve gradually come to accept that the &quot;fundamental physical constants&quot; of our universe could conceivably turn out to be just as arbitrary as the ratio of Jupiter&#x27;s major orbital axis to Saturn&#x27;s.",1420230090

8828292,comment,8824691,8824691,0,0,tomaskafka,,,"&quot;Hannah Arendt’s understanding of the political domain of the classic city would agree with the equation of walls with law and order. According to Arendt, the political realm is guaranteed by two kinds of walls (or wall like laws): the wall surrounding the city, which defined the zone of the political; and the walls separating private space from the public domain, ensuring the autonomy of the domestic realm.<p>The almost palindromic linguistic structure of law/wall helps to further bind these two structures in an interdependency that equates built and legal fabric. The unwalling of the wall invariably becomes the undoing of the law.&quot;<p>&quot;The breaching of the physical, visual and conceptual border/wall exposes new domains to political power, and thus draws the clearest physical diagram to the concept of the ‘state of exception’.&quot;<p>&quot;Future military operations in urban terrain will increasingly be dedicated to the use of technologies developed for the purpose of the ‘unwalling of the wall’.<p>This is the architect’s response to the logic of ‘smart weapons’. The latter have paradoxically resulted in higher numbers of civilian casualties simply because the illusion of precision gives the military political complex the necessary justification to use explosives in civilian environments where they cannot be used without endangering, injuring or killing civilians.<p>The imagined benefits of ‘smart destruction’ and attempts to perform ‘sophisticated’ swarming thus bring more destruction over the long term than ‘traditional’ strategies ever did, because these ever more deadly methods combined with the highly manipulative and euphoric theoretical rhetoric used to promulgate them have induced decision makers to authorize their frequent use. Here another use of ‘theory’ as the ultimate ‘smart weapon’ becomes apparent. The military’s seductive use of theoretical and technological discourse seeks to portray war as remote, sterile, easy, quick, intellectual, exciting and even economic (from their own point of view). Violence can thus be projected as tolerable, and the public encouraged to support it.&quot;<p>Eyal Weizman<p>Lethal Theory<p><a href=""http://www.skor.nl/_files/Files/OPEN18_P80-99%281%29.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skor.nl/_files/Files/OPEN18_P80-99%281%29.pdf</a>",1420229751

However, some DNA is more important than others.  In general, a little damage is not a problem and is easily &#x27;taken care of&#x27; by the cell which caries that DNA - either by literally repairing the DNA, silencing that DNA&#x27;s function, killing itself, or asking other cells to help kill it.<p>We know quite clearly that cancer is (generally) caused by a set of mutations - not necessarily in an order, but some orders are not successful. There are four or five genes which keep social order amongst the other genes. If you silence all of these, you get cancer.  Chance has it&#x27;s role in the roll of dice for which DNA gets damaged, but all the other parameters can be changed too - how many sided the dice are, how often the dice get rolled, and whether all the cells in the same tissue have correlated dice-rolls.<p>Cells that deviate from what they&#x27;re supposed to do are either (in order), repaired, silenced, voluntarily commit suicide, or are killed. There are proteins (genes) that are the final judges for each of these processes - and have &#x27;go, no-go&#x27; power. Only if all of these judges are killed do you get a cell that can do anything it wants - like replicate uncontrollably to the detriment of the host (&#x27;cancer&#x27;). Thus the statistics of getting cancer roughly follow the idea that you have to get random DNA modifications of those exact 5 genes, in a single cell. Lots of things can increase your random modification rate (UV, smoke, radiation, etc). Some of these things correlate though - and again, what hurts one cell, might hurt its neighbor just as bad. They&#x27;re not entirely independent events. For example, losing your DNA repair machinery (this is what HPV does - it silences your DNA repair machinery) amps up the baseline mutation rate and makes further mutations more likely (dependent correlations then arise).<p>The Brca gene that has caused so much controversy in patent law (whether a test for its existence could be patented) and indicates whether a person might or might be susceptible to breast cancer, is the master repair technician of the cell. In people who have this gene in working order, the Brca gene signs off on whether the cell is in need of repair. But if the Brca is not it working order, cells that are in need of repair might not get it, and instead are allowed to more freely operate under non-optimal internal conditions. If you are missing or have a mutated version of Brca, you are missing one of the checkpoint processes.<p>So again, we quite clearly know of a handful of genes which do most of the master regulation of a cell&#x27;s job - and if these jobs go unfulfilled - by having their blueprints be damaged by the environment - you have fewer and fewer mechanisms to prevent that single cell from runaway growth.",1420229460

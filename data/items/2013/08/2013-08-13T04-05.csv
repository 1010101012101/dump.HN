6204070,comment,6202436,6203139,0,0,SolarNet,,,"Your argument assumes that individual bitcoins exist...<p>Bitcoin ties a number to a script. By providing a cryptographic key for that script you can add that number with some other numbers from other scripts and then divide that value into new scripts (throwing away the extra). Bitcoin programs often generate new keys for just about every transaction (so it&#x27;s hard to link them together).<p>These scripts are transactions in waiting. They can&#x27;t complete until someone provides the key that decrypts them, and then puts them in another transaction. Bitcoin is deniable, no one can prove you have the key to some scripts (since you can generate the keys from something in your memory, as opposed to using the easier to use encrypted wallets), and if they tried to, it would be equivalent to a thought crime.<p>Now, as a legit business, you would be required to collect tax for your services (for sales tax), but you already have to do that, which is how it should be.",1376369855

Great tips that are useful for anybody/everybody, introverts and extroverts alike.<p>Just want to make the point that shyness/anxiety/insecurity != introversion. They&#x27;re completely separate spectrums. Sure, sometimes they cross one another, but correlation of the two does not mean causation.<p>Here&#x27;s a good post by Susan Cain (the author of Quiet) that gets at this idea: <a href=""http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com/2011/07/05/are-you-shy-introverted-both-or-neither-and-why-does-it-matter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com/2011/07/05/are-you-shy-i...</a>",1376368309

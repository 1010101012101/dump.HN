Here's why I think the plots did not show standard deviations --<p>Standard deviations are not an appropriate summary when talking about extreme values.<p>We're basically conditioning on extreme values (""plot temperatures of all cities <i>having their hottest March on record in 2012</i>"").  So, while the standard deviation might be a useful summary of:<p><pre><code>  P(temperature on day t),
</code></pre>
a standard deviation would not be a useful summary of:<p><pre><code>  P(temperature on day t | average temperature is highest recorded)
</code></pre>
In general, after you condition in this way, the events (""sample paths"" of the function ""temperature at time t"") don't look like the rest of the population.<p>They're oddballs, and by definition, there are only a few of them -- only one March can be the hottest on record.  Maybe the best comparison would be the second-hottest March, so plot that one.<p>There would certainly, for example, be no reason to believe this population looks Gaussian in the tail.  In fact, it would probably be misleading to make any assumption about what a ""typical"" extreme sample looks like.  This is probably why just other sample paths (temperature as a function of t) for that location were given, rather than some summary statistic.  You can't average oddballs.<p>There are probably locales for which standard deviation is not <i>ever</i> a useful summary.  I'm thinking of places which are subject to strong unpredictable variations, like Santa Ana winds, that are more a 0/1 phenomenon.  This would result in a multimodal distribution of temperature, which would make standard deviation misleading.  That is, it could be really cold, or rather warm, but unlikely to be in-between.",1334036434

In doing so, you lose what is probably the language's biggest selling feature.<p>Or, perhaps less relevant now, but I remember the days where people would go on about how Ruby didn't support native threads. Except there were interpreters that did use native threads with the exact same Ruby code. Was Ruby code running under one of those other interpreters still a Ruby application?<p>PHP too comes with expectations about the environment, like how it integrates into the web server stack, which if not met, is it still PHP? I'm not really familiar with HipHop, but, for instance, if you have to compile your code before deployment, you're not meeting one very prominent expectation of PHP: The ability to edit the code in-place on the live server (best practices notwithstanding).<p>So, what does define a language? Is a language just the syntax? Standard library APIs? Standard library behaviour (see Ruby example)? Runtime environment? I'm not sure you will find a generally accepted answer.",1334036129

You have to trip over PHP's poor design while trying to learn to program.<p>Outside of the wide availability of PHP servers for cheap, what makes PHP so great for beginners? With Ruby, Python, Go, hell, even JSP for the ""instant"", in-HTML effect, I just don't see PHP as some gloriously ""easy"" language to use.<p>On top of it, there are hundreds of thousands of PHP tutorials all across the Internet that just have poor, poor, poor suggestions and design patterns that lead to people storing passwords unhashed, or unsalted.

3820775,comment,3816646,3818796,5,0,mightybyte,,,"When Greg and I started Snap (Yesod didn't exist then), we did so because we were both running sites on Happstack and felt things could be done better.  First, at the time we had seen Happstack's lazy IO web server choke at high load and we wanted to implement a web server based on left-fold enumerators.  This had already been talked about for some time (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/happstack/issues/detail?id=29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/happstack/issues/detail?id=29</a>) but as of now still hasn't been done.  Second, we felt that the (then woefully undocumented) API was overly complex, exposed too much of the internals to the user, and was difficult to learn.  For instance, it exposes two different monad transformers ServerPartT and WebT (<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/happstack-server/7.0.0/doc/html/Happstack-Server-Internal-Monads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/happstack-server...</a>), and back then it was not obvious when to use each one, causing the user to suffer from the paradox of choice.  Third, we wanted to have a strong focus on good software design with clean, well-tested code.  Departing from happstack was not a decision undertaken lightly--we agonized long and hard.<p>When we released to the public, Snap was the first serious high-performance Haskell web server based on left-fold enumerators to reach a usable level of maturity.  We received an extremely positive reception documented both here and on reddit.  That was two years ago.  Fast forwarding to today, Happstack has made a lot of progress.  Jeremy has done a fabulous job with the happstack tutorial.  However it's still using the same lazy IO web server and still talking about changing.  The API is still mostly the same except that the doc pages have been modularized in way that I find makes it harder to find what I'm looking for.  I'd be tempted to say it's an objective criticism, but it could just be personal preference.  It also looks like a significant amount of work has gone into web-routes and type-safe routing.  This is usually marketed as being a Happstack thing, but as Jeremy recently demonstrated (<a href=""https://github.com/stepcut/snap-web-routes-demo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/stepcut/snap-web-routes-demo</a>) it can easily be used in Snap apps.<p>During that time Snap has come a long way as well.  We've ironed out a lot of bugs in the web server and associated API.  A lot of thought has gone into preventing slowloris attacks, file upload vulnerabilities, and the like.  We also have SSL support.  Six months after we released Snap, Warp came onto the scene with better raw performance numbers, but it's not obvious to us that sacrificing the Snap web server's maturity for extra speed is in the best thing for our users.<p>On the high-level side, we've made great progress exploring the Heist templating paradigm.  It has proven to be very flexible and have gotten a number of comments about how much users love it.  You can also use Heist with Happstack, and similarly can use Snap with a different templating system.  We spent at least 6-8 months designing our snaplet component system and feel that it turned out very well.  Happstack doesn't have anything like this, and a number of the first things you'll likely need in building a web app on Happstack are already available on a modular basis as built-in or third-party snaplets.  This is actually the heart of what we wanted to be working on when we started Snap, but we got side-tracked when we realized we weren't going to be able to use Hyena as our web server.<p>In summary, I would say that much of what is stated in the Happstack philosophy is also the Snap philosophy (the little False Simplicity jab at getParam has also been fixed).  Moving to the five items in Happstack's roadmap, Snap already has points 2, 3, and 5 as well as some of the items in point #1.  Even though it's not evident in Snap, I've always had a soft spot in my heart for acid-state, so I'm eagerly anticipating the planned replication and sharding.  Snap already has an acid-state snaplet which means that it's probably easier to use acid-state in a Snap application than it is with Happstack.  In my opinion, all this makes a compelling argument for Snap, but I'll echo Jeremy and conclude that if the Happstack project and community get you excited, then use Happstack.  If you like what we're doing with Snap, then we'd love to have you using (and hopefully contributing to) Snap.  Drop by the #snapframework IRC channel in Freenode.

All three have problems, but I like all three.<p>With PHP, you have to develop a coding style that naturally avoids PHP's weird areas. It's not really that hard to avoid the mines, but you do have to be aware of them.<p>In exchange, you get a scalable web server and a language that requires minimal babysitting. Instead of automatically throwing a 500 on a random, unimportant, uncaught exception, PHP makes a best effort, and most of the time the result is fine. <i>99% of the time, this is better behavior from a user's perspective as long as functioning perfectly isn't mission critical</i>. It may feel offensive to your OCD programmer nature, but from a pragmatic engineer's standpoint, it's oftentimes a better choice, especially when dealing with the dirty data that's so common in webapps. Do not use PHP in a banking setting.<p>Compared to running a rails app, administering and scaling mod_php is pleasantly hassle-free. A single webserver with a modest amount of memory can handle an large number of concurrent PHP processes and requests without needing to resort to reverse proxies or anything more exotic than a simple apache install. That's nice not only for the ease of setup, but also because it means fewer moving parts, and less maintenance. That's a very real plus, and I'd say that the shared-nothing architecture of PHP was great engineering choice.<p>Yes, the language is weirdly architected and oftentimes inconsistent. It can also be extremely productive, and many of its weird choices are extremely pragmatic. The security holes are pretty horrifying, though - the defaults should be much more locked down, and I've always been a bit mystified that they're not.",1334034215

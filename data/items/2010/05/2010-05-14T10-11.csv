Not just because you discover patterns but also because you sharpen your methodologies - with human languages you'll know which is the best way for you to get a vocabulary (reading books? watching television? memorozing the dictionary?) etc., just like with a computer language you'll know which approach works the best for you (write a game? solve the problems on Euler Project? read the specification? or a book? or a combination of these?).<p>Point is, if you know 10 programming languages well, you can definitely learn your 11th programming language in 90 days. Just like if you speak English, French, Spanish, Latin and German, you'll find learning Japanese a lot easier even though it doesn't resemble these languages at all.",1273834786

Very nicely done.<p>The rest of the article was rather mundane, sadly.<p>True consulting is just having a paid smart friend. Why do you need paid smart friends? Are you not smart enough? Don't you have enough friends where you work? Sure, but a _real_ friend will tell you things that are glaringly obvious yet could get them fired. A real friend will take on your problems as their own and worry about them along with you. A really smart person (in this context) probably has seen many more types of business models than the full-timers at your place have. A really smart person (in this context) probably has ways of working with people that you either haven't tried or tried and didn't understand (because you were busy doing your regular work)<p>It sounds trivial, but a paid smart friend (business consultant) can mean the difference between kicking ass and becoming mediocre.<p>Of course, I have fully become part of the dark side, taking the secret oath, learning the handshake, and swearing my allegiance to the forces of darkness and chaos, so all of this just may be misinformation on my part. :)",1273834323

And this is exactly what has happened with provision of schooling services in most parts of the world, even in countries that mostly have comparatively free and fair politics and largely free-enterprise economic systems. Education (schooling) is deemed so important that it must have substantial public subsidy (that is a reasonable proposition) and ""therefore"" it must be in the hands of a protected oligopoly. The flaw in policy is assuming that that which has general value to the public must be provided by a limited set of providers who enjoy exclusive subsidies.<p>""The education system is a formalised, bureaucratic organisational structure and, like any bureaucratic organisational structure, it strives for maximum autonomy from external pressures as its cardinal principle of survival.

In any case, straight MD5s are super-fast.

I'm just saying, I am missing how it solves the problem of weak passwords.<p>The real problem here is that I know I can't remember a sufficient degree of entropy.  Sure, there are all sorts of ways to fake it;  take the first letter of every word in a  sentence, but that's not exactly random, either.   I know a guy who, for a pass phrase, would use a 24 line block of text from some project Gutenberg title.  I doubt that was any more secure than 4 or 5 random characters.",1273831710

Nope, it's real physical kit in a datacentre somewhere, bought by someone, operated by someone, sold by someone. Think aviation industry. Does the fact that an airline leases its planes from a holding company mean that any less planes get made?",1273831570

So 1000x the computation is a lot more painful for the attacker than for a legitimate user who only uses the operation occasionally (create/change password and login).<p>Additionally, salts protect against attacks that use pre-calculated tables.<p>I haven't read Colin's scrypt paper, so I'm not sure if its strategy differs.",1273831392

Life in Italy is good in some ways that it likely never will be anywhere in the US (apsurd's comment about the latest place closing at 11), no piazzas like here, no beautiful old buildings and jumbled architecture.  But I'm getting pretty sick of the wages here and the general condition of the economy.  Actually... everywhere has problems, what's important is whether places try and tackle them, hard as it may be, and over the past 20 years, Italy really hasn't made much progress.<p>I could pretty easily find a job in Boulder, I think, but the last bit of the puzzle is seeing what's available for my wife in biotech or a related field...",1273831364

The killer feature is using historical velocity in conjunction with estimates to guestimate when work will be done. This forces managers to see the tradeoffs they are asking for when they ask to squeeze something in. Mainly because of that we found that simply adopting the tool actually improved our agile process. With regards to using it in place of a wiki it depends what information you're looking to track. Pivotal's nature is very feature/time orientated and so may not be suitable for consolidating information. The tags/search functionality might be useful here though. Assuming you maintained the tags this would allow you to aggregate related information retrospectively rather than having to continually consolidate as you do with a wiki.",1273831206

The author is talking out of turn and deserved that one-sentence reply.<p>Notice anything funny about this followup post, by the way? The author links to all kinds of praise, but doesn't link at all to the original letter! I don't know if he expects the world to have memorized or bookmarked it already, but it sure tells you where his priorities are. I bet he silently updates it with a link, but the fact remains that it didn't even occur to him to link back to the original article.<p>Finally, why is it more important for RMS to stop marginalizing himself than it is for the author to stop trying to drag RMS to compromise? I'm no RMS fanboy, but the author sure seems to think him an idiot who doesn't know what he's doing. Have you read the original post? Here's a sample of the author's compelling rationale:<p><pre><code>  Dr. Stallman, Google Docs is really useful.

2480575,comment,2479613,2480477,2,0,sigil,,,"> C, A, and P are not variables you can multiply together or perform mathematical operations on. They are more like booleans.<p>Right, but I wasn't restating CAP, just wondering about a follow on to CAP that considers the <i>probability of remaining consistent</i>, the <i>probability of remaining available</i>, and the <i>probability of no failures due to network partitions</i> in physical terms.<p>Is this not an interesting thing to consider? What if someone proves a hard limit on the product of these probabilities in some physical computation context? The CAP theorem is absolutely fascinating to me, especially if it has something real to say about the systems we can build in the future. The future looks even more distributed.<p>> It is pointful for networks that experience partitions. It just doesn't apply to reliable networks.<p>Is there such a thing as a ""reliable"" network when thousands or millions of computational nodes are involved? Are the routers and switches which connect such a network 100% available? If an amplification attack saturates some network segment with noise, what then?<p>As programmers, we desperately want things to work, and it's easy to greet something like CAP with flat out denial.

Because of the accelerated rate, you'll obviously miss some crucial pieces but those will fall into place if you, as you should, keep at least one personal project going at any given time.<p>Before you read all this, head over to MIT OCW and look up an intro to programming course. They sometimes have videos (thru itunes)<p>Step 1 is to get someone to explain to you what exactly is the computer doing when you write println'hello world'. This is so you get the big picture. Next step is to compile a hello world program. Then a lesson on strings and then on arrays. This should introduce you to them while providing a lesson in APIs - one of the more important things. This API lesson should have you look up documentation so you know how to read docs. This will take you 2 days...give it 5 - do lots of examples.<p>You can probably skip this but i'd recommend it - polymorphism, typing, properties...object oriented programming. This will probably blow your mind - not in an overwhelming kind of way but in a WOW, where was this till now kind of a way.<p>That is the essence of coding. You can now code and follow most examples on the net.<p>Next you need to become a software developer. For this, you'll take time as this is a blend of skill, knowledge, and experience. You will need to learn about things like data structures and recursion, trees and big o notations, algorithms and...stuff. EVERY programmer has to take a course called Algorithms and Data Structures. I'm sure you can find it on MIT OCW. If not, google 'ece250 uwaterloo'  -  they assume you don't know anything  and start C++ from scratch.<p>And thats that.",1303710762

I meant that:<p>- Installing stuff into system directories from through a second package management system (perl = cpan, ruby = gems, etc) is generally a bad idea (e.g. the apt-maintained perl libraries are not seen by cpan, so it will need to install those if there is a requirement for one of them in a cpan package you are installing).<p>- Upgrading versions of Perl libraries that are used by system (outside of the official package management system) Perl scripts can cause unexpected results.<p>This is why perlbrew is useful. It manages self-contained Perl installations that you can switch between in your particular environment.<p>The only downside that I've seen is with system-installed scripts that use the ""#!/usr/bin/env perl"" method to specify which Perl to run. I haven't seen this, in particular with Perl scripts, but I ran into this with virtualenv + comix as a Python script with ""#!/usr/bin/env python"" for the shebang line (it blew up since my virtualenv didn't have py-gtk installed).",1303707995

2480477,comment,2479613,2480406,1,0,jamesaguilar,,,"> You mean, in that case tolerance to partition and availability should be perfect.<p>No. If a network is never partitioned, you don't need to write algorithms that can tolerate partitions. Therefore consistency and availability are possible.<p>> So this is the really interesting question. All the CAP theorem says is that (C,A,P) != (1.0,1.0,1.0). How close to (1.0,1.0,1.0) could we make (C,A,P)? If infinitely close, then we have achieved perfection by the limit, and the CAP theorem is rather pointless. If not, then what is the numeric limit?<p>I think you have misunderstood the theorem (at least, if my bachelor-degree-level understanding is correct). C, A, and P are not variables you can multiply together or perform mathematical operations on. They are more like booleans. ""Is the web service consistent (are requests made against it atomically successful or unsuccessful)?"" ""Is the web service available (will all requests to it terminate)?"" ""Is the web service partition-tolerant (will the other properties still hold if some nodes in the system cannot communicate with others)?"" These questions cannot be ""0.5 yes"". They are either all-the-way-yes or all-the-way-no.<p>> . . . and the CAP theorem is rather pointless<p>Not really. It is pointful for networks that experience partitions. It just doesn't apply to reliable networks. It also sort-of doesn't apply when an unreliable network is acting reliably, with the caveat that since it is not possible to tell in advance when a network will stop behaving reliably, you still have to choose between these three properties when writing your algorithms for when the network behaves badly.",1303707644

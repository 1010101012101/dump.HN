2507946,comment,2507692,2507799,43,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interestingly one of the things that I found most amazing when I was working for Google was a nearly total inability to grasp the concept of 'deadline.' For so many years the company just shipped it by committing it to the release branch and having the code deploy over the course of a small number of weeks to the 'fleet'.<p>Sure there were 'processes', like ""Canary it in some cluster and watch the results for a few weeks before turning it loose on the world."" but being completely vertically integrated is a unique sort of situation.<p>Android is much like a more traditional vendor/customer model where they are at a place in the pipeline that has to co-ordinate with other things that are in the pipeline. Except when those 'other things' are hardware it gets really strange.<p>I was present in meetings in which all the folks at the meeting would nod their heads at some release date which was totally and completely imaginary. It existed so that dereferencing the term 'release date' didn't return 'undefined' :-). I remember my first project there I asked SRE (part of operations) for a date when they would be done with their part. Got that date, operated my part of the project against it, the date arrived and nothing. <i>Two days</i> before the date I had re-confirmed it, and on the date was told, ""Well its not quite ready, probably in a couple more weeks."" Really? One of the reasons people do 'starter projects' there was to learn this lesson.<p>The 'tablet' version of Android has been a <i>planning</i> disaster from the moment it was conceived as far as I can tell. Why isn't ChromeOS (basically Android kernel + browser UI) not the tablet version of Android? Android/Tablet vs Android/Phone? AFAICT its because Apple pulled off making iOS work between phones and tablets, and they only pulled that off because they had the iPod Touch for <i>YEARS</i> before they shipped the iPad and kept asking 'what is a non-phone experience like?'<p>I have no inside knowledge of how the whole 3.x thing went down but if it was like other projects there, rather than get some clear thinkers together in a room and put together a plan and then manage against the risks of that plan, two or maybe three 2 or 3 person 'teams' (friends likely, in their 20% time) probably started working on their vision of how it might work as a tablet, only to be out maneuvered at a review (or not) to have several competing versions going forward which then someone checked in first and everyone else was stuck following that version until someone else checked in something better. Reasoning? Planning? Discussion amongst stakeholders? Probably not so much.<p>So I would certainly place the underwhelming nature of Android tablets completely at Google's doorstep. Its not like the hardware is less capable than the iPads, in some cases its even more capable.<p>Its not in Googles DNA (at the moment) to execute against a customer/supplier type of arrangement. Fortunately I think there are some really smart people at Google who understand that, I hope they can prevail against the inevitable corporate anti-bodies that are now doubt even now trying to marginalize them.<p>I do believe that Android will win here but for the same reason that lava coming out of a volcano 'wins.'",1304372126

Here is another possible consequence.<p>Insurers might choose to protect themselves from this asymmetry by only offering very general medical insurance. Rather than insurance for specific conditions, such as cancer or nursing homes or anything that one might find out that one had a predisposition for, they would only offer insurance for ""lack of health"", or some similarly-broad language.<p>If they did that, lots of people would buy that insurance, because everyone has a legitimate risk of being unhealthy at some time, so you wouldn't get the situation where people with a genetic predisposition for a disease made up a disproportionate number of the people buying insurance for that disease.<p>That would also have great effects on the availability of good health insurance, because then insurers would have an incentive to cover a large number of conditions.

These simulations run inside an Eulerian grid, where each cell contains a fluid element.  These cells are collected into grid patches.  When a cell inside a given grid exceeds some criteria, we refine it by inserting 8 cells; the next level of cells are then collected and minimum bounding boxes are created that cover the flagged cells, and we compute now at an additional 'level' of refinement.<p>My research concerns the formation of the first stars in the universe.  In order to set up the initial conditions of these objects correctly, we have to resolve fluctuations in the background density of the Universe on the scale of kiloparsecs.  However, we are also mostly concerned about how the fluid behaves on much smaller scales, at the tens to hundreds to thousands of AU scale, all the way down to the radius of the sun or even lower.<p>In one of my ""stunt"" runs, I ran up to 42 levels of refinement inside a box; this means that the dynamic range between the coarsest cells and the finest cells was 2^42.  For the most part, however, we only use about 30-33 levels of refinement.  In order to attain this resolution, we utilize extended precision positioning.  (Future versions of the code will utilize integer positioning with relative offsets for Lagrangian elements like particles.)  Inserting this functionality into the code took quite a bit of debugging and testing, in particular because we had to account for differences in how Intel, PGI and GNU passed extended precision values back and forth between Fortran and C.<p>I have uploaded a very simple 2D zoomin movie of one of these simulations, which only had 30 levels of refinement, to Vimeo.

But, I do have to deal with past decisions and their reprecussions.<p>Those include helping feed and house 3 children and a wife, paying off ~$100k in student loan debt, and living in an area that, while generally intellectual, is not a startup haven.<p>Here's how I have dealt with the challenges:<p>- Find a position that allows you to meet your obligations and work flexibly -- in my case this means working remotely and without a set schedule (thank goodness).<p>- Find a group of peope, locally or online, that share your passion for starting something. Luckily, I am close to Kansas City, which has a burgeoning startup scene, and I discovered HN.<p>- Find and infect with your enthusiasm one friend or family member. For me, it is my wife and a very good friend from high school. This person will not only support you, but often go to bat for you when other friends question your choices.<p>Good luck!",1304370008

A machine destined for a data center will have an IPMI subsystem in it, that is the thing you can run the machine remotely from, reflash the bios and reboot if you want. A data center machine will probably have ECC RAM which a barebones PC won&#x27;t unless you are picky and find the one sku that ASUS and Gigabyte make that both have ECC capable chipsets <i>and</i> support in the BIOS. And lastly a datacenter machine will be <i>more</i> comfortable running headless than a barebones PC so there won&#x27;t be any thing popping up on the VGA screen and saying &quot;press any key to continue.&quot; Lastly a machine expecting to be in a rack in a data center probably has some insane fan noise when the fans spin up :-).",1411761574

This June I went to the neighbor&#x27;s 5th grade graduation and it lasted as long as my high school graduation in the early 90s.  Not saying it&#x27;s wrong, but it&#x27;s a shift in our values as a culture.  Part of it is that parents, especially dads, are expected to be more engaged in their kids&#x27; lives than their fathers were.  But I think that part of it also plays into the whole helicopter-parent trend, making a big deal of out achievements that everyone should reasonably be expected to attain.<p>On the other hand, those milestones are surely not the only time that this father missed with his daughter, they were the symptoms of a larger problem, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really relevant.",1411761410

8374528,comment,8374061,8374061,2,0,Mithaldu,,,"While i appreciate that they&#x27;re trying to do good, for people interested in communicating with people from other cultures translated technological terms have always been a massive bane. I live in germany and while germans generally have little patriotism they&#x27;re fierce defenders of their language, which led to all sorts of domain-specific terms being translated across many different kinds of media. Be it movies, books, technical manuals, programming instructions.<p>And for all of them it&#x27;s a common theme that someone who believes they know a thing, might even consider themselves an expert, they have trouble then branching out of their linguistic bubble. When talking to experts in their domain, from another language, they suddenly cannot communicate anymore, even if they speak the other language fluently, as they need to learn an entirely new vocabulary just for basic interaction.<p>And this is not just a theoretical situation. I&#x27;ve had problems when talking about books i read in my youth, because often important words or even names had been changed and the person i was talking with knew the same characters, concepts or ideas i knew but neither of us knew under what names the other knew them. I learned Perl on the internet, on my own, using exclusively the english source documents; when talking to german Perl programmers i&#x27;ve repeatedly had issues because they had learned it in german courses which used german CS terms. Instead of actually discussing business we spent half the time sorting out what to call a thing. I also translated MMO content professionally for a while. While our translations were great and allowed the germans a perfectly fluid native experience, we found that many germans tended to switch the game to english after a while, because they couldn&#x27;t talk to other players since the item names, skill names and location names were all different.<p>There are some situations where it&#x27;s fine to use a translated term. Example: Mouse. In german the word is written Maus and pronounced identically. In such a situation where the difference is minimal, a translatio can be fine.<p>However in all other situation i believe translation of domain-specific words does damage in the long term.",1411761221

I agree that NSF should pursue what scientists find interesting/important and disregard commercial concerns. NIH will often come ahead doing that as well. On the other hand, let&#x27;s look at NSA - They develop technologies for spying on people. They write software & do a bunch of other applied work detailed in that PDF.  I don&#x27;t think they should run a business either, but NSAs primary aim is not science.  If they go the extra mile beyond publishing a paper and want to license their code / tech to companies for a fee, I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;s a problem. Often some exclusive access or license can spur further investment. I do think open access to all can & often also spurs innovation - but not always.

8374488,comment,8372795,8373801,1,0,Yen,,,"A modern automobile is less similar to a horse carriage than an early automobile. On the other hand, it&#x27;s more similar to a horse carriage than, say, a washing machine. Compared to a horse carriage, a modern automobile is faster, lower to the ground, typically enclosed, and more aerodynamic. On the other hand, it still has 4 wheels and a set of seats.<p>Similarly, I think the current iteration of &#x27;online classes&#x27; is more similar to what online education will look like in 10, 20, or 50 years.<p>You assert that a lecture is the worst way to teach. What is a book or essay, but a lecture in written form? For some students, or some subjects, written text with diagrams might be superior. For others, a live voice, with gestures and diagrams might be superior. It&#x27;s worth pointing out that, when a lecture is recorded, it can be sped up, slowed down, rewound, and so on. If a transcript is available, it can be skimmed for recall.<p>But, you might argue, lectures, essays, and any such static methods are still &#x27;the worst&#x27;. Give me Socratic dialogues, interactive diagrams, hands-on labs and experiments! A - I&#x27;d assert that for some subjects (or portions of subjects), a lecture is actually better. B - This can and has been done in online classes, just as in real classes. In some ways, even attempting to use these &#x27;new and modern&#x27; methods could be seen as an anachronism, to the extent they look similar to existing methods used in live classrooms.<p>---<p>As for certification, it&#x27;s worth noting that some online course sites are positioning themselves as learning + certification sites. Also, isn&#x27;t the blanket idea of &#x27;certification&#x27; something of an anachronism? ;). Many on HN would argue that when hiring, a cert or degree is only a very rough filter, and interviews / work samples are superior for assessing competency in a subject.<p>Think about the current state of offline certification - we have things like University Degrees, CISSP, and the Bar.<p>University Degrees are a broad indicator of a person not being stupid, and perhaps having studied some particular topic at one point in their lives. On the other hand, most jobs treat them as necessary but not sufficient, and other jobs treat them as optional. Once a candidate is in front of an interviewer, a Degree probably won&#x27;t sway the hiring decision much.<p>Then there&#x27;s more specific certifications, like the CISSP. Like you were suggesting, the CISSP can be obtained without necessarily taking any other classes, as long as one has acquired the necessary knowledge and experience. Those hiring treat this certification anywhere from absolutely necessary, to nice but optional, to an indication that a candidate is undesirable.<p>And then there&#x27;s certifications like the Bar. While not technically requiring taking any class, it would be fairly difficult to pass without one. It&#x27;s an absolute necessity to have, to work in that field.<p>University Degrees range from mildly to very expensive (but at least some multiple thousands of dollars), and are a weak indicator. The CISSP exam is ~$500, not counting study materials, and is an &#x27;ok&#x27; indicator. Merely taking the Bar will run multiple thousands of dollars, not counting the necessary classes, and is a strong indicator.<p>Where do you see your envisioned online certification service? Do you think you can crack the problem of actually useful certification, without charging students multiple hundreds of dollars per cert?",1411760659

With those learnings, we built our own realtime database engine that supports relational data (which Meteor doesn&#x27;t yet support) and also some other major features like the ability to undo any user action out of order (like git revert), which is necessary to support undo in a multi-user context (because the last thing that you did may not be the last change globally if other people are concurrently making changes).  Undo is a particularly challenging feature to implement in a structured relational database context, because it can&#x27;t be reduced to a set of simplistic character insertion operations as is the case for a google word doc, or a spreadsheet (which is a simple 2d array of values without type constraints, foreign key relations, etc).",1411760501

Relevant properties in this case are associativity, commutativity, etc.\n> As an example, I&#x27;d try writing properties such as:\n>     for all X, Y: add(X, Y) = add(Y, X)<p>These properties can also be satisfied by implementations of add() that:\n  - return a constant value\n  - return the smallest number of (x, y)\n  - return the largest number of (x, y)<p>The cases you threw out as an &quot;obviously broken implementation&quot; are required to actually validate that functionality of the method. The functionality of the method is also one of the properties of the method.<p>You can write it in a more generic way than simply: assert(7, add(3, 4)). However, those tests are _also_ required. Without them, you never actually test that the `add()` function does what it&#x27;s supposed to: add two numbers together.<p>Regardless of type system, you also have to worry about underflows and overflows - another property of the functionality of the method.<p>> You are right, without additional information property testing would be less useful. Which is yet another reason to favor static typing in my opinion.<p>Static typing doesn&#x27;t help you constrain sets of inputs; it may not be valid that your method accepts all ranges of integers. You could have a method `addbase2(int x, int y)` that is to be used <i>only</i> when x and y are powers of two because of an optimization you perform in that method. Static typing doesn&#x27;t help you generate the correct input set for x and y.<p>The only thing that static typing provides, in regards to test cases, is this:<p><pre><code>    def add(x, y)\n      assert x is int\n      assert y in int\n\n      return x + y\n\n    // test cases\n    assertIsThrown(add(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;))\n</code></pre>\nThat was the test case you had.<p>Regardless, the point of the article was not about static typing being bad. There is value it. However, there is also value in not being so rigid in your type system that things don&#x27;t work well.<p><pre><code>    add((short)0, (long)1)   // compiler error if you have an extremely rigid type system\n</code></pre>\nGeneric systems typically swing the pendulum far to the right requiring an extremely rigid type system. That always causes pain. The question you have to ask, is the ROI worth it. For some, it is. For others, it&#x27;s not.",1411760145

Spread at execution. IF the latter is consistently wider it&#x27;s not a market it&#x27;s a con, take your business elsewhere.<p>Again, that&#x27;s the complaint they have, see, you do understand the debate.",1411758451

8374294,comment,8370508,8372741,0,0,javierluraschi,,,"Who &quot;exploits and manipulates&quot; developers? If the answer is their dev manager/lead, good, that&#x27;s their &quot;job&quot; (being sarcastic here); but yeah, I expect from my boss to give me some direction when needed.<p>However, I think you are pointing out that devs get &quot;exploited and manipulated&quot; by, surprise, other PMs. I really can&#x27;t think of someone else that is good at this. So yeah, just remove PMs that are specialized in &quot;politics&quot;.<p>Now, if you remove &quot;politics&quot; PMs then you could argue that customer support, cross-team requests, etc. will impact developers. In this case, dev managers/leads should prioritize those requests and it should be painful to take away dev time to serve other tasks. If it&#x27;s painful you will probably invest time in fixing the customer support issue rather than managing your customers. If you are spending too much time serving marketing requests, maybe you just have a bad product that needs improvements before it gets shipped, etc.<p>I really don&#x27;t believe easing politics is the way to go.",1411758385
8374293,comment,8373914,8373914,8,0,Erwin,,,"Here&#x27;s one use case: i tried importing a 500+ row wine spreadsheet into it (it has columns like type, producer, name, vintage, rating, source etc).<p>I had to save the file as CSV and import it -- or at least that&#x27;s what I thought, but filepicker seems to support picking from google drive. I don&#x27;t know if it would have accepted a spreadsheet.<p>Your app seems sluggish to scroll compared to Google Docs at that size, and the record density seems low (I see 29 records per page vs 50 on Google Docs). This is using Chrome 38 on Linux.<p>The &quot;link to another table&quot; seems interesting, but my data came denormalized so I have a column with e.g. 10 different repeated values on 500 rows. Maybe it would be nice to automatically clean that up somehow. For example, I could Copy the column and have a some Paste (unique values only) option. Maybe the dialogue that comes up (suggesting to expand the spreadsheet) could even tell you about that. Or maybe there could be an option to convert a text field to a separated linked table.<p>I had some conditional formatting set up via Google Docs, which could be nice to have here; e.g. red wines have a red background in that wine type table.<p>I don&#x27;t have a simple primary key -- it&#x27;s really a composite of {wine producer, wine name, vintage}. The app didn&#x27;t mind importing non-unique values into that first column. I don&#x27;t know what the alternative might have been -- an auto-generated primary key?<p>Having said all of the above, I really like Google Docs and it will take some amazing features to make me switch to anything else. Multi-user planning and documentation via docs is great -- I have a shopping list everyone can update and I can see it change real time on the phone in the shop while someone is changing it from their desktop, and it&#x27;s always up to date.",1411758365

Some of those fail routines have been remarkably creative (and occasionally ridiculously destructive).<p>Delayed flags with adverse consequences, subtly changing CAD points or musical note timings or slowly corrupting user data if a dongle has bad wiring. Deliberate hardware damage, from the C64 disk drive happily being made to chew on its own heads to (arguably) setting counterfeit USB serial interface chips to a PID of 0. I&#x27;ve even seen one which quietly dropped to desktop with a virus when tripped (in fact this was the origin of that particular bootsector virus, which achieved an unexpectedly wide spread on its platform, and its own payload had a generation counter attached so you wouldn&#x27;t notice for quite a while).<p>This one is curiously poetic. Very meta. But still a logic bomb.<p><i>Don&#x27;t</i> booby-trap your code. It&#x27;s incredibly unethical and stupid. Logic bombs misfire. Frequently.",1416268777

It&#x27;s as if the author thinks that because you drink a beverage instead of eat it, it can&#x27;t make you any less hungry, and therefore you keep on eating and drinking and get fat.<p>If anything, when I drink a glass of milk I feel more satiated (less hungry) than I would for a lot of foods.  Beverages can definitely make you feel full.<p>In addition, I&#x27;ve seen a good amount of evidence that protein (in milk or other foods) produces more satiation per unit calorie than carbs or fat.

8621411,comment,8620716,8621284,0,0,_delirium,,,"I also have rarely seen much contributed back in my limited experience, especially outside of the &quot;tech industry&quot; proper. I&#x27;ve noticed the lack especially in &quot;big engineering&quot; (oil & gas, CAD, aeronautics, etc.), and recently also in &quot;data toolkit&quot; type markets like proprietary bioinformatics toolkits, data-mining toolkits, GIS packages, etc. I don&#x27;t work there myself fwiw, but for various reasons have spent some time observing development practices. BSD-licensed code is included in tons of profitable proprietary products in those areas that have never contributed back a line to the original project. Much of the time they drag their feet on even giving any <i>acknowledgment</i> to the project they took the code from. Really they would prefer to pretend they invented it all themselves, 100% Custom Proprietary Solution, with no acknowledgement whatsoever. They do typically grudgingly make the legally required copyright acknowledgment, but in the &quot;New BSD&quot; variant of the BSD license that removed the traditional requirement for acknowledgment to be prominent, that&#x27;s pretty easy to bury in fine print in the most obscure place you can concoct (a random .txt file on the install medium, or somewhere in the fine print at the end of a manual, are two popular options).<p>A plausible counterargument is that these types of companies wouldn&#x27;t contribute back anyway: they just aren&#x27;t interested. In that case the practical choice is between letting them free-ride off your code (BSD) or not letting them use it at all (GPL), because they aren&#x27;t going to make a choice that involves contributing back, regardless of your license. In that case I can see people leaning towards BSD. But I&#x27;d personally lean towards GPL, because I think that, at least often, shutting these companies out of the ability to use open-source code would probably be a net win for society. But it&#x27;s hard to prove that. And this probably depends significantly on your goals and the kind of software you write.",1416266559

It provides encrypted incremental-forever (unlike duplicity, duplicati, rsnapshot, rdiff-backup, Ahsay etc) with no server-side processing and a convenient CLI interface, and it <i>does</i> let you prune old backups.<p>All other common tools seem to fail on one of the following points<p>- Incremental <i>forever</i> (bandwidth is expensive in a lot of countries)<p>- Untrusted remote storage (so i can hook it up to a dodgy lowendbox VPS)<p>- Optional: No server-side processing needed (so i can hook it up to S3 or Dropbox)<p>If your backup model is based on the old&#x27; original + diff(original, v1) + diff(v1, v2).. then you&#x27;re going to have a slow time restoring. rdiff-backup gets this right by reversing the incremental chain. However, as soon as you need to consolidate incremental images, you lose the possibility of encrypting the data (since encrypt(diff()) is useless from a diff perspective).<p>But with a hash-based backup system? All restore points take constant time to restore.<p>Duplicity, Duplicati 1.x, and Ahsay 5 don&#x27;t support incremental-forever. Ahsay 6 supports incremental-forever at the expense of requiring trust in the server (server-side decrypt to consolidate images). Duplicati 2 attempted to move to a hash-based system but they chose to use fixed block offsets rather than checksum-based offsets, so the incremental detection is inefficient after an insert point.<p>IMO Attic gets everything right.

It wasn't even a quick glance, he spent most of the time I took to work on the problem checking his email. I'm still not sure what to make of this because personally to me this was probably the most unprofessional/rudest thing that's ever happened to me at an interview. I wouldn't even dare to pull out my phone during an interview and I expect the interviewer to have the same courtesy unless it's an emergency.<p>It was a decent experience and your offices (at least in London) are lovely but if you are looking for C/C++ specific graduate developers/engineers then that should've been made clear.",1362750864

5343388,comment,5342998,5343250,2,0,mixmax,,,"Thanks for the comment, I know what a command line is, I just find it incredibly confusing and unintuitive. To exemplify here are a few of the problems I run into when faced with a command line:<p>- what can I do here? There are no tips, clues, or any other way of knowing what to write. The answer often given is that there are MAN pages, help files, etc. that you can bring up by typing more cryptic commands. I just don't have the motivation to sift through a whole bunch of documents that may or may not have the answer I'm looking for.<p>- On a windows machine CLI doesn't work out of the box. I need to install cygwin, configure it, and do all sorts of stuff I don't know about and don't care about.<p>- I get no feedback. When I've typed some cryptic command into the commandline and hit enter I'm presented with a prompt. Maybe everything went well, maybe it didn't. Maybe I now have a virus since I found the cryptic command somewhere on the Internet. i just don't know.<p>- I can't undo stuff. When I type a command and then find out it was wrong, I have no obvious way of undoing it.<p>The point isn't that command lines are bad, on the contrary it's quite obvious that it's a really powerful tool. It just has a steep learning curve, and not all people are interested in spending the time it takes to master it just to get a wordpress installation up and running.<p>The point is more that it's hard for experts to see why it's so hard to just type 'grep -lsm (er /:rt) disc -f' to make the computer magically do something. There are a whole lot of assumptions that take years to master before you can type a command like that and not have your heart skip a beat when you hit enter.<p>And that's okay, it's why good hackers are worth a lot of money. The majority of people however, just want that wordpress blog to work.",1362750667

5343377,comment,5338129,5338129,1,0,dietlbomb,,,"<i>8. ""The Valar would prohibit the eagles from such a direct intervention against Sauron.""<p>I am surprised that this argument comes up as often as it does, because I am aware of no textual support for this idea. The eagles quite frequently involve themselves in the fight against Sauron (or against evil in general):<p><pre><code>    They rescue Bilbo, Thorin, & Co. from the orcs and wolves.
    They participate in the Battle of Five Armies.
    They rescue Gandalf from Orthanc.
    They rescue Gandalf again from Zirak-Zigil.
    They directly attack the flying Nazgl during the last battle.
    They fly into Mordor to rescue Frodo and Sam.
</code></pre>
Given all this heavy involvement, it would be extremely surprising if the Valar specifically prohibited the eagles from flying the Ringbearer into Mordor. Tolkien nowhere mentions such a prohibition.<p>The only support I can see for this argument is very indirect: namely, that the eagles are said to be the representatives of Manw, and in the Third Age, Manw is maintaining a policy of the Valar not intervening directly in the affairs of Middle-Earth. But the eagles do often intervene in the struggles of Middle-Earth, and there's no indication that they were under some restriction in this case. If the eagles were prohibited from being involved directly in the struggle against Sauron, we might expect that they would have withdrawn to Valinor long ago rather than remain in Middle-Earth.</i><p>This is the actual reason, but there is more evidence to support it than the OP gives, but like most things Tolkien, you need to read outside the usual narrative to find it. The best explanation for this is how the rules of Manwe govern the wizards, particularly Gandalf:<p><i>Emissaries they were from Lords of the West, the Valar, who still took counsel for the governance of Middle-earth, and when the shadow of Sauron began first to stir again took this means of resisting him. For with the consent of Eru they sent members of their own high order, but clad in bodies of as of Men, real and not feigned, but subject to the fears and pains and weariness of earth, able to hunger and thirst and be slain; though because of their noble spirits they did not die, and aged only by the cares and labours of many long years. And this the Valar did, desiring to amend the errors of old, especially that they had attempted to guard and seclude the Eldar by their own might and glory fully revealed; whereas now their emissaries were forbidden to reveal themselves in forms of majesty, or to seek to rule the wills of Men and Elves by open display of power, but coming in shapes weak and humble were bidden to advise and persuade Men and Elves to good, and to seek to unite in love and understanding all those whom Sauron, should he come again, would endeavour to dominate and corrupt.</i> Unfinished Tales, Ballantine paperback, p. 406.<p>The Valar are allowed to send the the wizards to Middle Earth with the consent of Eru, with constraints on what the wizards are allowed to do. This implies that Eru, the overarching God of Tolkien's universe, has a plan for events in Middle Earth, and that he doesn't want the higher powers (the Valar) to interfere directly.<p>The eagles are also servants of the Valar, and are not permitted to directly interfere with events. Discounting the events of <i>The Hobbit</i>, the eagles only show up to help when everyone has already made the right decision informed by faith and hope. When the eagle finds Gandalf on Zirak-Zigil, he had just sacrificed himself to defeat the balrog and he had been returned to Middle Earth (clear Deus ex Machina there too). When they attack the Nazgul in the last battle, it was after Aragorn and the other leaders had committed their armies to a ""hopeless"" last stand. When they flew into Mordor to rescue Frodo and Sam, it was after they had finished the quest.<p>There are multiple times where the intervention of Eru in the events of Middle Earth are implied. Gandalf hints that Bilbo was meant to find the ring. Gollum steals the ring and falls into the fire. A wind out of the West blows away the smoke cloud that appears when Barad-Dur crumbles (and the smaller smoke cloud that appears when Saruman is killed). So the prohibition against direct Valar action in Middle Earth is no small thing.<p>Would it have been nice if the eagles were discussed more in the book? Probably, but it was pretty long already.<p>If you are interested in this sort of stuff, I recommend listening to the Tolkien Professor podcast.",1362750454

This number of platforms is decreasing, not increasing (ie, Android dropped).<p>Indeed, there are problems with both implementations. I'm not saying that flash is the way forward at all, just that I'm starting to doubt that html5 technologies can actually achieve on a technical level what flash has acheived in a reasonable time frame.<p>Ignoring ideological issues for the moment (which are important too, but we could be here all day) the major benefeit of html5 right now is that your games can run well on gnu/linux machines, on which flash performs terribly. Techinically you can also target smartphones/tablets, but the performance here is really quite bad on almost all devices. So there is this promise of true cross platform coverage that isn't really being acheived. The major downside is this browser incompatibility stuff we've already discussed that is really hampering the platform, and the performance issues, which also varies wildly with browsers.<p>> Agreed, no one solved the problem of cross-platform application development (both desktop and mobile) yet. And flash doesn't succeed much, if any, better than HTML5 in this regard. But looking forward HTML5 looks more promising too me.<p>We're in agreement here, except for that last part.

It's used to ""illustrate how the damsel in distress trope disempowers female characters and robs them of the chance to be heroes in their own right."" An illustration need not be a random sample nor a carefully selected representative sample, and I didn't hear any claim to be so.<p>What's ambiguous about ""disempowering""? Most of the presentation elaborates on how ""disempower"" is an appropriate word in this context.<p>> False attribution 10:38<p>This section interprets the trope using the subject/object dichotomy, where subjects act and objects are acted upon. This does restrict things to a single dimension, and you may think it's not a useful reduction. But objectification means ""denial of autonomy, inertness."" Where is the false attribution?<p>> Slippery Slope 10:48<p>Is the time quote right? The text around 10:48 doesn't mention kidnapping. "".. damseled women are acted upon, most often reduced to a prize to be won, a treasure to be found, or a goal to be achieved."" Perhaps you mean the kidnapping implicit in being 'damseled'?<p>But, the presenter at 17:50 gives examples of how imprisoned (kidnapped people are imprisoned) male characters are not treated as objects. ""They are ultimately able to gain back their own freedom. In fact that process of being able to overcome the ordeal is an important step..."" Clearly, kidnapping does not imply that the kidnapee is necessarily an object, and I don't see how you draw the opposite conclusion.<p>> Black or white fallacy 11:19<p>Where does the presenter say that games where women are not the main focus are necessarily sexist? I don't get that inference that you draw. This is about the damsel in distress trope.<p>> Browser is not important and you don't even think about him until the end of the game<p>Bowser is the antagonist in the games. He has motivation for what he does, even if that doesn't affect most of the game play. Eg, from Wikipedia ""His ultimate goals are to marry Princess Peach, defeat Mario, and conquer the Mushroom Kingdom."" Under the subject/object description, Bowser is definitely a subject when looking at the Mario series as a narrative, rather than just a set of actions.<p>Tell me - what motivates Princess Peach? Does she have any goals? What actions does she do to carry out those goals? If you can't answer those questions then she's an object, not a subject.<p>> Cherry picking 12:30<p>""Cherry picking"" doesn't really apply when there are ""literally hundreds"" of examples. But in any case, your objections of the last three paragraphs are not related to this presentation. The goal of this video was to examine the 'damsel in distress' trope, not to examine sexism or lack thereof in all video games.<p>> doing it in a overly-formal tone just to look more serious to gain credibility with mostly biased, false or unrelated claims<p>I disagree quite strongly. The language was easy to understand, the logic consistent, and the points valid.<p>In another video (""Feminism in Focus - Anita Sarkeesian""), the presenter says ""I started Feminist Frequency because I felt like feminism was sort of trapped in academic spaces and politically radical spaces ... in this language that was really hard to understand and I wanted to create a space where feminism was easy to engage with in an accessible way.""<p>So what may be throwing you off is that the presenter uses (and explains!) literary analysis techniques, while you are not used to this rigorous presentation style.<p>As an example, you might say ""Indiana Jones is the protagonist of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. The Nazis die in the climax and the Ark is hidden in a vast warehouse in the dnouement"" then you are specifically using a literary analysis described by Freytag.<p>I might come along and ridicule you for using an overly-formal tone, when everyone knows that ""Indiana Jones is the good guy in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', the Nazis all die just when it looks like they are going to win, and it finishes with the Ark being hidden into a large warehouse.""<p>We've said exactly the same things, but in this analogy you are using the more technical language while I am using the less precise vocabulary.<p>I propose that this is quite analogous to the case here. This is a literary analysis, and so it is entirely appropriate to use terminology from that domain. I suspect you haven't had much experience with feminist analysis, and so the use of basic technical vocabulary from that field - even when explained - makes you think it's overly-formal.<p>I have not studied feminist analysis, but I have studied some literary and a lot of scientific analysis. I saw nothing in this presentation which was overly formal or lacked credibility.",1362750062

It amounts to a Horn-clause subset of predicate logic and in that it is similar to Prolog. One of the substantial differences is that Datalog doesn't allow functions in terms. That makes Datalog strictly less expressive but it also gives you a guarantee that a Datalog program will always terminate. In comparison, it is trivial to write even a simple Prolog program that does not terminate.<p>Datalog is really almost just a special syntax for Horn-clauses; it is purely declarative. Prolog is much more than that in that it adds features like cuts, arithmetic, built-in functions, and everything else that's needed in a practical programming language.<p>Also, a Prolog interpreter implements a sophisticated backward-chaining algorithm. So Prolog basically means backward-chaining. In comparison, I would say there is no default evaluation strategy for Datalog.

</code></pre>
From the perspective of the caller, that code is still blocking. It solves the problem of threads being blocked, but that's only one of the problems you have.<p>The real and more complete alternative would be to work with a well designed Future/Promise framework, like the one in Scala [1] which is also usable from Java [2]. Doing concurrent computations by means of Futures/Promises is like working with Lego blocks.<p>Let me exemplify with a piece of code that's similar to what I'm using in production. Lets say that you want to make 2 requests to 2 different endpoints that serve similar results. You want the first one that completes to win (like an auction), but in case of a returned error, you want to fallback on the other one (type annotations and extra verbosity added for clarity):<p><pre><code>    val url1 = ""http://some.url.com""
    val url2 = ""http://other.url.com""

    // initiating first concurrent request
    val fr1: Future[Response] = client.get(url1)

    // initiating second concurrent request
    val fr2: Future[Response] = client.get(url2)

    // the first fallbacks on the second in case of error
    val firstWithFallback: Future[Response] =  
      fr1.fallbackTo(fr2)

    // the second fallbacks on the first in case of error
    val secondWithFallback: Future[Response] = 
      fr2.fallbackTo(fr1)

    // pick a winner
    val finalResponse: Future[Response] = 
      Future.firstCompletedOf(firstWithFallback :: secondWithFallback :: Nil)

    // process the result
    val string: Future[String] = finalResponse.map(r => r.body)

    // in case both endpoints failed, log the error and 
    // fallback on a local copy
    val stringWithFallback: Future[String] = string.recover {
      case ex: Exception =>
        logger.error(ex)
        File.read(""/something.txt"")
    }
</code></pre>
Given an HTTP client that's based on NIO, the above code is totally non-blocking. You can do many other crazy things. Like you can wait for several requests to complete and get a list of results in return.

(Game as a Service)<p>This is hardly a new concept, Eve Online is a fairly prominent example of a game that is run entirely as a subscription service. I'm sure there are other MMO games that do the same, however there are others like World of Warcraft which combine a subscription service with a ""boxed"" game client.<p>In the context of the current discussion, I think EA could have made the new SimCity game entirely service based, like Eve, giving the client software as a free download and charging for access to the server, where most/all of the actual simulation logic would live. Instead they've pulled a bait-and-switch with a boxed product.",1362747933

Some are valid concerns, others not so much but you end up with a (very) pessimistic view of things if you consider only opinions expressed on HN. It makes me feel a bit sad and down.<p>I think this happens because people who like the post, product, etc don't know how to express appreciation in a meaningul way. Maybe it is easier to pinpoint specific things that you don't like than to be specific about a product you like. You get that overall feeling that it is an improvement but cannot easily pinpoint all the reasons why.<p>I also have faith that things can improve if people, instead of only writing about specific things that they don't like, take some time to also write about the small things that often go unnoticed but make great products great.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5339287"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5339287</a>",1362747926

Does this also exclude basic sanity checks such as calling back the phone number on the notice to check whether the corporation in question actually filed this notice, or whether notice-filer actually exists, whether the phone number is actually connected to the corporation the notice claims to be from, etc? Because otherwise, it's just a matter of time until somebody is going to ... take down all the things.<p>I just checked Wikipedia on perjury and it says, ""Statements which entail an interpretation of fact are not perjury because people often draw inaccurate conclusions unwittingly, or make honest mistakes without the intent to deceive. Individuals may have honest but mistaken beliefs about certain facts, or their recollection may be inaccurate, or may have a different perception of what is the accurate way to state the truth"", I think this is pretty much the case for LayerVault. So they won't get penalty of perjury, because they <i>did</i> believe their work had been infringed ... even when it's based on a wrong idea of what constitutes an actual infringement instead of a ""heavily inspired by"" rip-off?",1362747660

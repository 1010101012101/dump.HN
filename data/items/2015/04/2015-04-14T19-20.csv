9376850,comment,9373262,9376744,0,0,RootDynasty,,,"One thing to note is that the the parallel map consisting of two mapping operations has a different hidden overhead. If a message is received by a process that does not pattern match with any clauses in the receive block, the message is stored in a queue. When a new receive block is entered, all messages in the queue are pattern matched against the new receive block. In the worst case scenario, the worker process mapping the elements will finish in list order, so a great many pattern matches will be tried.<p>The solution to this problem is just to store messages as they are received inside of a map data structure, so that there is no overhead for receives. This requires indexing the list which makes the code a lot more inelegant.<p>Edit:
Given n processors and an input of size n, I believe the time complexities are:
Two map solution: O(n^2)+O(f)
Fold solution: O(n^2)+O(f)
Two map with map data structure: O(n)+O(f)<p>Where O(f) is the asymptotic upper bound of the function being mapped<p>Edit 2: This has me thinking about what will be the most efficient way to assign an element from the list to worker processes. In Erlang, it&#x27;s clear that there isn&#x27;t a way to avoid the O(n) overhead since the original process must reconstruct the list in order using cons.<p>In an imperative language this isn&#x27;t necessary. Perhaps the original process can recursively assign indicies by spawning two children worker processes which are given a range of indicies to work on (who then create their own assignment processes). I believe the overhead is then only O(log n)...",1429041364

Artist Joseph Peirmatteo, for instance uses a similar style:<p>Piermatteo example: <a href=""http://lesintemporels.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/piermatteo_comme_sur_des_roulettes.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesintemporels.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/piermatt...</a><p>Romero: <a href=""http://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/romero-britto/first-love.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/romero-britto/first-love....</a><p>Picasso: <a href=""http://www.umma.umich.edu/images/view/collection-galleries/picasso-two-girls-reading.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umma.umich.edu/images/view/collection-galleries/p...</a><p>Marceau Constantin: <a href=""http://www.avignon-et-provence.com/musee-provence/musee-marceau-constantin/img/visage.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avignon-et-provence.com/musee-provence/musee-marc...</a><p>We also have obvious stylistic &quot;borrowing&quot; from Roy Lichtenstein..<p>and James Rizzi: <a href=""http://www.galerie-am-dom.de/prdimages/James-Rizzi-_Day-or-night-my-city-is-bright.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.galerie-am-dom.de/prdimages/James-Rizzi-_Day-or-n...</a><p>in terms of that &quot;black outline&quot; mentioned in the article, Keith Haring uses a similar technique and color palette.<p>The point is that artistic style isn&#x27;t trade dress. If that were the case then Cubism would have ended with Picasso and Braque. Pop art would have ended with Warhol. Interestingly, Artists have appropriated brand names (i.e. Campbell&#x27;s Soup, Brillo) for their own artwork (from which they made a significant financial gain,) so Apple, appropriating an artistic style is returning the favor.<p>I find it interesting that the suit has to claim that Romero Britto is a &quot;world-famous visual artist.&quot; That&#x27;s subjective. An Apple customer in Dallas, Texas or San Diego is very likely not going to be confusing Apple&#x27;s ads with Romero. Even if there were some kind of connection, it would be an &quot;homage&quot; and not a dilution of Romero&#x27;s &quot;brand.&quot; For example, using an audio clip in a commercial that sounds like a Bob Dylan guitar riff (but isn&#x27;t,) isn&#x27;t infringing on Dylan&#x27;s trade dress. Providing that there Romero is financially harmed in this case is going to be next to impossible. In fact, his stock likely goes up after this -- which explains why he&#x27;s suing Apple. It&#x27;s all about the payday, not the damage to his art.",1429040419

This means the construct has increased the attack surface, potentially critically.<p>> The system I described is not trivially defeated because defeating it implies defeating KC.<p>Your system introduces potential new vectors to defeat KC. If KC were not broken, this construct likely weakens KC. If KC were broken, this construct may provide some minor protection. Whether it provides sufficient additional protection to actually protect the data from an adversary capable of breaking KC is extremely unlikely. Given KC is a peer-reviewed secure ciphersuite and CC is not, the emphasis should be on keeping KC secure - not weakening it to introduce an untested (likely insecure) ciphersuite in a custom composition. This is doubly the case given significant and on-going real-world costs of implementing and maintaining this custom solution.<p>> My point is that _if_ AES is broken without our knowledge, using the system I described can still make untargeted-surveillance impractical.<p>An adversary capable of automating AES decryption would already have automated weak-cryptosystem decryption.

I have participated in a hackathon several previous times as it was lax with its entry requirements (I was not a student but an alumnus), but their sign-up page now says it is open to undergraduates and high school students with special permission.<p>I have a BS and MS in Industrial and Systems Engineering and an MBA but my passion for the last few years has been anything and everything related to programming. Iâm willing to travel all over the country and the world to attend these events as they are great opportunities for learning, meeting people, working with technologies that arenât available, and providing a good reason to be in front of a computer for 24 or more hours at a time. Iâm willing to pay a non-student entry fee or do whatever else is necessary to help out to offset the additional cost that I would bring. Having a bunch of computer science students working together is great, but the hackathon experience can be greatly enhanced by people who have different backgrounds or industry experience, are entrepreneurial, or have connections to companies, financing, jobs, etc.<p>Different backgrounds bring different people and thinking together. How would having a marketer, pianist, chemist, or sports therapist change the idea generation process? Industry experience is provided on the tech side by some of the sponsors or organizers, but you will never know what software pharmaceutical companies need unless you have someone with a Doctor of Pharmacy who has been working with pharmaceutical software for several years like my one friend who attended the hackathon. You will never know what huge opportunities are available in the Department of Defense or data architecture fields unless you have someone like myself with years of experience working in those industries. Our mix of two people with industry experience (PharmD in pharmaceutical, MBA/Engineering in DoD), and students in Psychology (med. school ambitions), and traditional computer science can lead to both some wild ideas or practical software that is desired or needed in industry.<p>Trying to include entrepreneurs and people with business interests are another way to improve hackathons. I was really impressed that there were over 100 submitted projects for this hackathon, an incredible number and an accomplishment for a hackathon that has been growing bigger every semseter. Most of these projects will die and never be developed for in the future. And while that is a good idea for most of the hacks, some are promising for future development. I would love to see some of these hacks turn into businesses, start generating revenue, or start accumulating large user bases. This is often too much of a time/money constraint for a broke student to accommodate amongst the many classes, projects, exams, work, and debt that they have to deal with. Opening hackathons up to non-students can get entrepreneurs, funding, and people who have the time and money resources to take the project to the next level involved.<p>Bringing in non-students also can bring in connections to companies which can be invaluable to students. This can bring in people who have access to jobs, internships, and exclusive technologies. It also can bring experience to show students how technologies or work flows exist in industry and what to be prepared for as ideas move from one or two person teams into businesses with hundreds or thousands of employees.<p>I stole this off of my blog, as the concerns I had previously are the same.<p><a href=""http://jbutewicz.com/hackru-fall-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jbutewicz.com/hackru-fall-2014/</a>",1429038275

Itâs meant to be a simple programmatic API for crypto operations, while being high-level and excluding unsafe options. NaCl (<a href=""http://nacl.cr.yp.to/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nacl.cr.yp.to/</a>) has similar goals to Keyczar.<p>Keywhiz isnât an interface for software to do crypto. Rather, itâs a system to manage the secrets/keys used for crypto and making them available to the services that need them. It doesnât explicitly look at the content of secrets, unless a plugin is used.",1429038075

It doesn&#x27;t matter how polished your product is -- databases are complex enough that people are willing to pay for best practices, training, and support.<p>Similarly, databases are pretty critical pieces of the infrastructure. If anything goes wrong, it can significantly impact the business, so people always want operational/production support.<p>There are many enterprise services that can be built on top of the product that can be very valuable. You don&#x27;t have to build a crappy product -- there are plenty of ways to monetize with a great product.<p>Finally, a bad product will significantly limit growth of the company in the long term. There are lots of options now -- you can&#x27;t get away with building a crappy product and an artificial monopoly.<p>If you see a crappy product from a company that offers subscription support, it&#x27;s probably not because of misaligned incentives. Building databases is <i>really</i> hard, I don&#x27;t think the business model has much to do with it.",1429038075

At least with the current system you can more or less choose a CA to trust (or, more interestingly, a bunch of CAs), that you can change anytime you want. The only thing preventing you to do it is the lack of tools to actually do it, which is why tools such as TACK/HPKP, or Convergence/Perspectives, are needed.<p>With DNSSEC, there is only one realistic root ever possible (call it ICANN or NSA as you want, that&#x27;s yet another problem)",1429038015

Then step two (if Lumen isn&#x27;t going fast enough) is to go raw PHP as you described.<p>But if your service is getting that popular, memory leaks are going to be a problem, maybe moving to HipHop (or whatever it&#x27;s called now) or Node or something is a better idea.<p>Sounds like you&#x27;re having fun!",1429038008

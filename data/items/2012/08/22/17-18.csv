Cattle raised under these conditions have to be fattened up before they can be sent to a slaughterhouse. Typically these cows will be shipped to another ranch that specializes in this before then being shipped to market. It sounds like the guy quoted in the article is running one of these secondary ""fattening"" ranches.<p>Since grain (or in this case candy) has a much higher energy content than grass, cattle can be raised to market weight much faster than if they were fed a grass diet.<p>Edit: I accidentally a word.",1345658377

4418626,comment,4417125,4418362,1,0,think-large,,,"OK so what I'm attempting to say here is that it is not possible to compare scientific discovery with that religion.  Science grows from its failures. I understand that.  While I'm not a scientist, I am an Engineer and I have a solid (albeit not exhaustive) background in science.<p>Science does not inherently deal with morality.  Thus it can't truly be compared to religion.  Honestly, the religious should stay away from explaining the natural world, but they don't so we get some crazy stories.<p>>This is false. Religion punishes dissent and doubt. Science encourages it. The most reliable way to earn a scientific reputation, a Nobel Prize, is to cast doubt on a theory and produce evidence to back up the doubt. In religion, that can only get you expelled or killed.<p>This is the only point on which I disagree with you.  If you study religion, you will see that they grow and adapt naturally.  An example would be Vatican II.  Did you know that the early Catholic church did not believe that Mary was ""Assumed"" into heaven?  Now it's as good as a ""religious"" fact.  That change came about non-violently from inside the church.<p>Power is something people try to find anywhere.  The atom bomb was a tool to be used against populations, and so is religion.  Many people are dissilusioned by religion because they see historic bad behavior and want to stop it.  Hence, lets get rid of religion.  This is not the case.  ""Evil"" or acts that you and I would deem in breech of basic human rights come from other people and they will use any tool they can.<p>Yes, many Catholics believe papal decrees to be infallible, they are idiots. A church should never be considered above it's own laws.<p>They are two different models for belief and inquiry.  I think that much can be learned in religion from the scientific model, and that science needs to stay pure (i.e. away from religion).<p>That doesn't mean that we can throw moral standards aside and begin human testing, but it does mean that the religious should try to stop scientific exploration for fear of a loss of ""faith"".  If their faith is so weak that it is centered around how the universe works, then they have a problem. I.E. Kill Galileo cuz he's going to ruin our plans.<p>That was a power move by a corrupt church, not a religious move where ""God"" said to the pope, ""That dude is going to make all sorts of trouble for the Catholic church, we better of him.. oh yeah that one commandment I taught you, I'll ignore it.""<p>This corruption is peppered anywhere there is power, even in science.  I know some grad students are asked to falsify data... I don't constitute this as proof.  It's really just to show that the notion isn't out in left field. <a href=""http://ctscanhollywood.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/workplace-bullying-tell-them-to-stop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ctscanhollywood.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/workplace-bu...</a><p>Does that mean that science is bad?

There were plans to do it, due to the fact, that for application coding there, the most controversial features are not used very often, and because of the posts like yours, that Scala is too complex. However, these features are essential for library / framework type of code. Scala collections library could not be that easy to use, powerful  and clean if these powerful features like implicits were not in the language. Things like Squeryl could not be implemented, without adding special support in language (like in C#). Scala is pretty simple - just a few, very generic, powerful features, instead of thousands of special cases and compiler quirks.<p>As for verbosity: I coded a lot in Python, in Perl and then in Scala, and found Scala code to be sometimes even shorter. Note Scala is statically typed, it is harder for statically typed language to be terse. It does pretty well in this area, for a statically typed language.<p>As for doing things in different ways: in Python they say there should be one obvious way to do it. But it really isn't.

4418539,comment,4413569,4416303,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>""After years of trying, I finally learned how to budget when I was about 25. One of the most important lessons I learned then is that budgets are often a time when people imagine the life they want and try to prescribe it to themselves instead of taking an honest look at the reality of their behavior.""</i><p>Excellent. There are two parts to budgeting, you mention the first one which is understanding where your money is going, the second part is prioritizing where your money <i>should</i> be going. Part of the latter is understanding what is (and what is not) withing your means.<p>So if you are making $70K and you're hanging out socially with people making twice that, you are going to be at a disadvantage in 'expensive' activities. Someone with $100K in income which is taking home over $1K/month more than you after taxes, might decide they are going to spend $500 a month on track time at the local race track (driving fast is very fun of course) that is way too expensive for someone who is only making $70K. As a person budgeting you always ask ""Is this valuable, or is it expensive?"" [1] understanding the difference can really help clarify what you want to spend money on.<p>But lets think about the social aspects for a minute. Young people especially (although it is present across age groups) have a tendency to 'brag' either subtly or not so subtly using money. Called 'conspicuous consumption' back in the day, you can recognize these people right away, they always have the latest tech gadget, or a car that is less than 2 yrs old, or this seasons fashion accessories, etc. Why they are like that varies but how it affects you the $70K earner, and more importantly your budget, is key. You have to resist giving into that way of validating yourself and your friendships and instead actively pursue other paths. So if you're budget is being warped by those kinds of influences you might seek out ways to avoid them. It is tough since nobody likes to say ""I can't afford to do that stuff that you are doing every day"" even when its the truth. However good friends will figure it out and adapt.<p>Under no circumstances pretend you are something you aren't, I knew a guy in the dot com days who was pretending to be a lot more well off than he was in order to 'hang out' with some actually wealthy people. He got the bar tab once at one of their events, it was a bit over $12,000. He had to call AmEx to get them to approve it. I personally would not think the access was worth that sort of shock to the budget but recognize different people value different things way more differently than I.<p>[1] One of the engineers here at the office who has a background in economics introduced me to that phrase and it really captures the essence of budget prioritization.",1345657290

This is because, you <i>want</i> someone to be able to reset their password/public key/auth token if they forget/misplace/get stolen. Sure, things would be a lot easier if you left the liability on the user, by explicitly stating that if Acts of God (legal term) happen to him, you are not liable. But in this day and age where I see every service tending towards dummifying and hand-holding, I don't see this approach being popular at all.<p>In the above approach, by pushing all liability onto the user, you tell him that HE and ONLY HE is responsible towards the safe storage of his credential. It's not like in real-life, people can't come up with a gun pointed at you and tell you to give up your auth token, assuming they MitM'ed your password.",1345657113

But in order to verify those tests we have to be able to sense in some way shape or form the results. The natural sciences are limited in that nature.  I can't feel, I'm using the abstract idea of feel not that of the sensation we get through our skin, the results of an experiment.<p>The point that I'm making here is that religion needs to stay where it belongs.  In the realm of behavioral side of the argument. I'd argue that anyone who said, ""God created the universe"" means that they are uninterested in the science behind it and that it is immaterial to their belief in God.<p>I'd argue that most religious don't associate God with controlling the atoms of the universe and setting it to begin.  Sure they get comfortable with this explanation if it is presented long enough (2k years or so), but it doesn't matter to the abstract idea of God.<p>The ""proof"" of God comes not from what we can prove through observation (using our 5 senses + any tools we can create), but rather through a sense, a feel, a concept that there is a sixth sense in our minds.  There is something we cannot touch.<p>In that case there should never be a proof for or against God.  It's an abstract idea coming from feelings that we have of a spiritual core.<p>Also, philosophical debates have a great deal of practical consequences.  If someone takes a philosophy to heart they can do a lot of damage.  I know that many people argue that religion has caused harm, but it isn't the religion, but the institution that harms people.  I think people can use anything to justify their behavior, God or no.  It is when people objectify others and treat them as such that we have a problem.<p>So I'd suggest that we could look at the different disconnected cultures in the world that have ""religion"" as a set of evidence that there is something in us that wants to believe in an external being.<p>My theory is that there is a God, and anyone is free to disagree.<p>That is at the core of religion.  The only truth I hold is that the later part of that statement is the most important.<p>Also, I realize that a hypothesis like that above is subjective and not capable of being dis-proven, thus most scientists worth their salt should and would never waste the energy to create an instrument to test it.<p>But that doesn't mean that it isn't possible or a valid explanation.<p>I freaking love this topic :-)  P.S.

In my experience, it's something you choose for yourself, because you recognize the need.<p>That would be nice, but it doesn't reflect reality. In schools, children are frequently given autism spectrum diagnoses against their better interests, or wishes, or the wishes of their parents (but not always -- sometimes parents force these things on their children). But the patient's wishes are often the lowest priority.<p>Ideally, people would volunteer for therapy solely on issues they choose for themselves. But this isn't how clinical psychology works in modern times. Schools have a vested interest in getting diagnoses, because special-education funds are only available for those with a diagnosis.<p>The reason Asperger's is being abandoned is because it was applied in exactly the way described above, until everyone realized it was  a scam -- even the therapists who benefited the most. Now it's slated for removal from the next edition of the DSM, and further, the diagnosis criteria for autism spectrum is being reworked to prevent another epidemic of nonsense diagnoses such as we have just seen.<p>> The odds that you receive a psychiatric evaluation against your will and be compelled into therapy are amazingly slim.<p>On the contrary, it's an everyday occurrence, especially among children, who aren't mature enough to realize that psychologists aren't doctors.<p>> Especially for something like 'autism-spectrum' disorders, where the majority of sufferers appear to be high-functioning.<p>Yes, and that is the present problem area -- bogus diagnoses, using vague criteria that can be applied to nearly anyone, with obvious advantages to everyone except the patient.<p>Mental health professionals, aware that autism spectrum diagnoses are out of control and no longer have any connection to reality, have joined an American Psychological Association task force charged with redefining ASD to stem the tide of nonsense diagnoses. One of those behind the redefinition effort (Dr. Fred Volkmar, director of the Child Study Center at the Yale School of Medicine) says of the diagnosis surge, ""We would nip it in the bud.""",1345656352

The sound reproduction is incredible, to the point where it makes anything under 200kbps completely unlistenable.<p>They're so clear that I could even hear a metronome quietly ticking in the distance during a guitar solo on Meshuggah's Catch 33. I'd listened to that album many times before, but I'd never noticed it until I listened with my Etymotics.<p>That said, the frequency response is very realistic. You're not going to get scooped mids with huge, muddy bass out of them. If you're planning on listening to hip-hop or dubstep then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. Shure and UltimateEars have some stacked driver designs which offer most of the benefits of the Etymotics, but with more bass. I haven't heard the UltimateEars firsthand, and I've only listened on a $100-ish pair of Shures. The mid-price Shure's are okay, bet they don't hold a candle to my Etymotics. Then again, the they're 1/4 the price, so that's par for the course.<p>The ER-4s also have phenomenal sound isolation. They're almost as effective as a pair of earplugs, even when you're not listening to music.<p>My only complaint is that the pair I had was a bit flimsy. One of the ear pieces actually snapped off in my ear (though I was drumming at the time, so I may have been asking for it).

There is, for example, a tradition of atheism in Hinduism[1] - rejection of the ""fact"" that there is a guy in the sky who created everything. It deals mostly with human action - its nature and motivation. And fwiw, very few, educated, Hindus I know (anecdotal) are even aware of this. You are correct when you say advocating religious views can lead to encouraging extremists, but I think you might be also dismissing, with little study, the moral teachings and the focus on self without the need to resort to a god-figure that some religious traditions espouse. (I only know of this in Hinduism, there might be more.) I'd rather learn from that rather than dismiss it as irrelevant gibberish.<p>This is not to say that religion is some sort of magic cure-all, but that some traditions do exist - possibly out of our individual experience - which cannot be easily dismissed but which should be merged into our views as well. I treat religion as a conduit to self-improvement, not as a way to book my place in heaven, which is why your pretty angry,dismissive view of religion seems restrictive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism_in_Hinduism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism_in_Hinduism</a><p>Edit: added wikipedia entry",1345656245

So you're right in saying that there's no way for DBC to offer the depth or span of knowledge that a 4 year CS degree offers, but that's not its goal. I think the program is designed to teach you how to learn about programming, and give you a huge jumpstart in doing it. Consequently, nobody there is religious about any one topic. Yes, we all learn Ruby, Rails and Javascript, but what we really take away is not the knowledge of how to do things in Rails, but the ability to learn programming concepts, now and in the future.<p>As for learning on your own, I would respectfully submit that learning often happens in groups. At DBC there was a lot of solo time, but there was a lot of pair/group time, where we continued learning from each other. Group time is arguably more valuable since it not only affords the opportunity to learn form what you're doing, but also what everyone else is doing, to say nothing of the meta-skills gained from working on software in a team. I personally gained a lot being immersed in an environment where 40 other people were learning with me versus trying to do it on my own.<p>You're right: I think most people used jQuery for ajax. That said, if Marty McFly went back and destroyed jQuery one day, I'm sure it would only take about 5 extra minutes for anyone to implement XMLHttpRequest instead. We all had to figure out how jQuery ajax calls worked, we could figure out XMLHttpRequest as well.<p>Finally, thank you for keeping an open mind despite your skepticism. So many seem to use any skepticism to completely dismiss the concept. There are also many on here who support it, but it's a pretty open pace so I'd suggest you go check it out for yourself during the Fall cohort if you're curious.",1345655398

But science isn't a belief system or some kind of guarantee, it's simply a disciplined way to compare ideas to reality.<p>> The problem is that science was BUILT to fail.<p>That's true, but is is certainly not a problem. In science, ideas can only be falsified, never proven true once and for all, and <i>that is by design</i>. Every scientific theory awaits falsification through new evidence, and some resist falsification for very long periods. No scientific theory ever becomes true in a final sense.<p>That is what separates science and religion.<p>> Religion does adapt, and grow, and find failures.<p>This is false. Religion punishes dissent and doubt. Science encourages it. The most reliable way to earn a scientific reputation, a Nobel Prize, is to cast doubt on a theory and produce evidence to back up the doubt. In religion, that can only get you expelled or killed.<p>> How many scientific theories are proven not to be accurate models for the data? Is that not a failure?<p>No, that is a success, and an essential part of the scientific process. Falsifiability, the idea that any theory can be disproven by way of evidence, is the single most important thing to understand about science, and it's what separates scientific theories from all other kinds.<p>> There is a perception that science does not fail.

Microwaves come to mind as an incredibly popular limited-scope device (all it does is reheat food) whose function just duplicates a more common kitchen appliance (oven/stove/range).<p>The big thing with 3d printing will be the little things: cups, forks, plates, bowls, battery covers, buttons, dice, car interior parts (dashboard panels, clips, knobs, dials, etc). Maybe it's not interesting if everything you own is new & you don't have kids, but these will come in very handy replacing lost and hard-to-find parts for fixing up old things.",1345654955

In fact, it's pretty hard to differentiate a string from an array of characters.""<p>It's difficult to differentiate a number from an ordered n-tuple of bits, but that doesn't make storing the number 123 storing an array.<p>I took the parent post's point to be clear: it isn't whether you <i>can</i> look at something as, in some sense, an array, it's whether you <i>treat</i> it as an atomic value. That's generally what you do with numbers: you update the whole number, not the third bit. And it's likely what you do with strings---even if you just want to change one character, you update the whole string, not the third character.<p>Likewise, if you want to store a complex number as a 2-tuple, you could treat that as an atomic data type <i>even though</i> it consists of two elements by always operating on the pair*. That's the respect in which it ""stands on its own""---you don't peer inside.",1345654954

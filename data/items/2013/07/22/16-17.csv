6084952,comment,6083826,6084666,11,0,bane,,,"> As someone born in the bottom fifth who worked up into the top fifth, a big part of it is actively escaping childhood culture and that culture&#x27;s expectations. When I grew up, I didn&#x27;t know anyone wealthy or successful - I met them when I was an adult. Good role models are critical for kids&#x27; sense of scope and possibility.<p>I don&#x27;t think I could have said it better. I too grew up relatively poor, in a hick area 30 minutes outside of the nearest white trash town, lumber yard, dying steel mill and trailer park.<p>I never even conceived that I would be able to obtain the life I have now, not even by half. Outside of my school teachers, I knew exactly one person with a college degree (my father) who spent most of his life dealing with family members who attacked him for having one (&quot;so Mr. College, do you want to join us for a family dinner, or are you too good for it?&quot; was a common thread). The available options to me were so limited, and going elsewhere involved so much more money than I had, it was inconceivable that I would have a life other than what I had seen.<p>I managed to pull myself up just enough to realize I didn&#x27;t want to work low-paid hourly jobs and drive discount used cars for the rest of my life and enrolled in the local Community College to try and learn a trade.<p>As it so happens, my wife grew up in a newly wealthy family (her almost entirely uneducated father made a boat load during a housing boom in his native country), and simply &quot;knew&quot; how to operate in the upper-middle class. I met her while she was studying English at the same College as an international student (with the insane international student tuition paid for out of her own pocket). She simply had the cognitive tools to know how to make good money management decisions, how to buy things and haggle for good value, how to represent herself (even as a foreigner) so she&#x27;d end up paying the middle-class price for things instead of the poor person&#x27;s price for things (one of the first lessons I learned, turns out it&#x27;s cheaper to be richer):<p>An example:<p>I grew up where everyone around me bought used cars, some junk, some okay, all had expensive maintenance issues within the first year or two...but it&#x27;s just what people did. The redneck with 20 cars in his yard? That&#x27;s because he figures he can by 3 cars at $100 a piece and cannibalize (with hundreds of his own labor hours on top of any extra parts he needs to buy) them to make one good car he can drive for a couple months.<p>My wife was able to demonstrate that people like my parents, were spending <i>on average</i>, much more per mile over the life of their used car than we would if we bought a cheap new car with a reputation for high reliability. I still drive that same car 11 years later. My current cost per mile, even with high gas prices, is something like $.18 a mile. My parents spend something like $.50-.60 per mile.<p>And on and on and on. It was an entirely new way of looking at the world that simply never occurred to me or it appears anybody else around me.<p>Recently, one of my old friends from my hometown was up in a fit that a sweet lease he has on a basement apartment is going to be up in 2 years. This was a problem because he couldn&#x27;t figure out how to afford the higher rental price that the market had gone to in the last 5 years and thought he might have to move out of state (another strange compunction I&#x27;ll get to in a minute). I asked him, &quot;wouldn&#x27;t you be making more money via raises or a new job by then?&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m not qualified to get any of the jobs around here, the closest one I could find required at least an Associates Degree or a Certification.&quot;<p>So given a 2 year lead, it never occurred to him that he could simply solve his entire issue by getting some education or a couple of quick certificates out of the way. Worse, and I&#x27;ve found this as very common where I come from, pointing out these simple facts generates lots of very aggressive resistance.<p>The other strange obsession I&#x27;ve found is the &quot;solution&quot; some find in poor areas or &quot;chasing expenses down&quot;. This means that, stuck in a job that&#x27;s paid the same for the last 10 years, and costs rising, they can no longer afford to stay in their home areas. So the solution is to move to an area that has a lower cost of living -- of course without regard for the lack of jobs.<p>They try and and &quot;chase&quot; down expenses. This is of course opposite of moving to an expensive city, making much more money only to have it gobbled up by very high living expenses...except in an expensive city, the opportunity to keep moving up ahead of the rising expense curve actually exists. You can&#x27;t chase down expenses forever, eventually you find yourself in an area with no jobs and miles and miles of endless 4th hand trailer homes and no opportunity to chase expenses down even further.<p>Being poor without access to what people with money actually <i>do</i> with their money (and how they come about that money) is very very hard for a young person to figure a way out of on their own. It&#x27;s why poverty is systemic in many areas and the examples that are shown: boxers, basketball players, drug dealers, etc. are the ones kids gravitate towards because that&#x27;s all they can see.",1374512207

At the time, there was a huge debate over the effectiveness of tenure.<p>By the time I graduated, the normal &quot;right of passage&quot; of getting tenure had turned into a multi-year process which focused entirely on what research you had conducted, the amount of money you were bringing into the school, how many articles you had published, how current those articles were, etc. It had absolutely nothing to do with how good of a teacher you were - and everything to do with how much research you were doing and where your articles were published.<p>Needless to say, I opted not to enter academia, mainly for this reason.

This is a fairly common term, with over five million results in a Google search. I&#x27;ve used the same phrase myself for over 10 years with the same meaning.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density</a><p>&quot;Pixels per centimeter (ppcm), Pixels per inch (PPI) or pixel density is a measurement of the resolution of devices in various contexts: typically computer displays, image scanners, and digital camera image sensors.&quot;<p>Of course here we can see where the terms get a bit confusing: &quot;...pixel density is a measurement of the resolution...&quot;<p>But display resolution these days usually refers to the <i>number</i> of pixels, not their physical size:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution</a><p>&quot;The display resolution of a digital television, computer monitor or display device is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed.&quot;<p>Advertisements and spec sheets almost always use &quot;resolution&quot; this way, for example the MacBook Pro specs on Apple&#x27;s site:<p>&quot;Supported resolutions: 1440 by 900 (native), 1280 by 800, 1152 by 720, ...&quot;<p>Forgive me if this seems like nitpicking, and I completely agree with Joel&#x27;s point here: patents often do use unusual terminology to obfuscate what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>This just isn&#x27;t a case of that. The patent is using the correct term, and it even does a very good job of explaining what it means:<p>> A particular characteristic of display components that may affect presentations rendered thereupon is the pixel density of the display component, such as a pixels-per-centimeter measurement. It may be appreciated that such characteristics may be independent of the size of the display component (e.g., two display components of the same size may present different pixel densities; conversely, two display components of different sizes may present the same pixel density) and/or the pixel dimensions of the display component (e.g., two display components displaying a presentation with a particular pixel dimensions may do so with different physical sizes).",1374511603

The v-chip has been mandatory in the US since January 2000 - and since analog broadcasts were ended every functioning tv receiver now has a v-chip in it.  It is basically impossible to watch broadcast television without a v-chip in the loop.<p>So what happened?  Nothing.

My own primary use for it has been to replace Google for syncing my contact lists and calendars, thanks to its CardDAV and CalDAV support, but I&#x27;ve also used it sparingly for file storage.<p>It certainly gives you a lot more flexibility than Dropbox: you can have access to your stored files via WebDAV, if you just want to directly access them on the network rather than sync.  I haven&#x27;t even installed the desktop sync client.<p>But at this stage, OwnCloud is definitely a solution for hackers and geeks rather than the general public.

I initially tried to get it running on my web hosting account, but eventually had to move it to my VPS due to OwnCloud not working well with the web host&#x27;s Apache config.  I also ran into a number of minor bugs that I had to correct in the source.<p>Overall, the release version seems more like a beta than a robust release at the moment, and even where it does work well, you certainly are exchanging &quot;just works&quot; for greater flexibility and configurability.

Simply put, I think many of the best scientists have been nerds, and many smart nerds really don&#x27;t see the utility in playing the political tenure game. I&#x27;d argue that the competition is fiercer now than it&#x27;s ever been in the sciences, so these selectionary forces against nerd-types are getting stronger.<p>We end up with the situation where scientists in academic jobs are enriched for those good at politics and playing the game, and we lose brilliant minds to companies. Companies also do their part, and offer alluring salaries and job security (I&#x27;ve had quite a few recruitment attempts for wonderful companies, and almost left academia on several occasions).<p>With the folks in academic positions being political (and sometimes downright manipulative), it&#x27;s no surprise that some make terrible mentors. Their success quite often relies on extracting work from postdocs that will never have their success. Sadly, there&#x27;s no incentive for symbiotic relationships sometimes. Luckily, finally, I have met mentors that are exceptions to this, and are nerds like me (and quite frankly, keep me in the sciences). But it took a long time to find such mentors, and other very smart people are not so lucky as to find these types of mentors and they leave the sciences. Sadly, this enriches for more bad mentor types. I think the role my mentors&#x27; mentors had is huge too; often my mentors talk about how important their mentors were.",1374511358

So it&#x27;s only really effective when taken orally, because it relies on the first-pass metabolism for its action.  Morphine itself, on the other hand, is quite significantly converted into inactive metabolites when taken orally. So you end up with IV morphine being ~3x more active as the same oral dose, because it bypasses the first bit.  Other drugs are exclusively one route because they rely on other processes for transformation or absorption.<p>This matters because it&#x27;s not really appropriate to schedule chemicals which happen to trigger a response in a test-kit, but are not plausibly drugs of abuse due to side-effects, or lack of any reasonable mechanism of getting to the sites where they&#x27;d be active.<p>The &quot;intended for consumption&quot; is a convenient fiction for the head-shops and dodgy websites that sell such things, but actually having to test things which aren&#x27;t intended for use in certain ways would be a massive imposition on, well, everything that uses chemicals[2].<p>There are heuristics that cover a lot of ground, and that&#x27;s basically what the Analog Act tries to preempt, but there are still huge numbers of potentially active compounds we have no idea about.

I&#x27;ve been using reactive.js [1] lately with Component [2] and its incredibly beautiful by contrast:<p><pre><code>    <form data-submit=&quot;login&quot;>\n</code></pre>\nIt uses data attributes, functions are handled for you automatically so you don&#x27;t have to write the parens all the time, it will fallback to the model automatically if the view doesn&#x27;t have a certain property.

This API can be used to access this service.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve had a look at the code, I&#x27;ve noticed that it includes the API keys which grant programs using this library the appropriate access permissions for the service. I think this is wrong, and that these keys should not be included in an open source library. The rest of the code however, is fine, as it simply implements a protocol.<p>If I were to develop something like this, I would leave out the API keys and have the user of the library fill them in. In principle, and as someone else has mentioned here, it would be possible to develop and operate your own service which uses this protocol/API. And I see nothing wrong with that.<p>Well, except of course that the whole notion of an app which  presents information for a set period of time after which the user can no longer view it is inherently flawed, since eventually someone&#x27;s going to figure out how to not erase/hide the information.",1374510955

6084798,comment,6083230,6083864,2,0,VLM,,,"&quot;In some mid-west cities you can earn over $10,000/year/house after all taxes and expenses (including saving for long term expenses like roofs).&quot;<p>Possibly true anecdote.  However with the median family income for the country being $45K or so, thats implying the profit alone exceeds something like 25% of the median tenant gross income.  So thats like a $1M CEO waterfront house not joe6pack&#x27;s house.<p>Somewhat more realistically, you can expect your average family to spend maybe 1/3 their income on housing, and your profit will probably be a fraction of that, and you&#x27;ll only have tenants a (large?) fraction of the time, so from a scalability standpoint to earn a median income you probably need to rent out one to two dozen houses, which rapidly becomes a full time job and is quite a capital investment.  Also it becomes interesting to express various typical maintenance costs as &quot;months of rental profit&quot; rather than $.  A furnace might be more than a years gross profit, yet only guaranteed for 20 years... times ten other major appliances all carefully value engineered to fall apart...<p>One worrisome part about long term prices is a Z percentile resident will more or less always live in Z percentile housing.  Now the capital cost of that housing solely depends on about 1/3 the resident&#x27;s income put toward the mortgage interest payment... and that rate was at multi-generational lows aka prices were at multi-generational highs. J6P can afford to pay the bank $2K/month means he can borrow how much, depending on interest rate?  So what happens to your capital investment when median income inevitably continues its multi-generational decline, while at the same time, interest rates inevitably rise resulting in crashing sale prices?  There are other cultural effects like retiring baby boomers wanting to downsize, kids having mortgage sized school loans therefore unable to afford a mortgage, etc.<p>Just saying, focusing on return OF capital is probably more important than return ON capital, when you&#x27;re doing long term real estate investment.  From a diversification stand point it can work if you have 100 or so houses, but its rough at a smaller scale.",1374510926

My hope is that careful management can reduce the exposure these individuals have to reinforcement.<p>Why? It is a terribly dangerous precedent to set for something that you just admitted would not prevent rape.<p>>The danger is not to &#x27;previously ordinary people&#x27;. The danger is that people with predispositions can be convinced that they are right in their beliefs or feelings.<p>So, even though it would not prevent rape, you want the whole of society to have their internet censored and monitored so that a small fraction of mentally ill people cannot(assuming the censorship is effective) get from the internet what you perceive would be a validation of their supposed deviant beliefs?<p>> For example, that feminism is against the &#x27;natural order&#x27;. That is quite a common one.<p>You want to also censor debate that disagrees with feminists?<p>> But you want to start stamping it out on the internet first?<p>>Not at all, if there existed such a place where people with rape fantasies could go to discuss them together.<p>Even if there was a place where women discussed their rape fantasies?<p>> I would support its closure and perhaps even the monitoring of its participants.<p>So you do, in fact want to start stamping out discussion of &quot;deviant thought&quot; on the internet. Should psychologists and therapists be required to report people who admit to having rape fantasies during counseling sessions, so the deviants can be monitored by their local police? Should they be marked with a tattoo (for everyone&#x27;s safety)? Required to wear a tracking device?<p>> It&#x27;s a fine line to walk but I take issue with the idea that it&#x27;s either all or nothing.

Of those that couldn&#x27;t, I would say approximately 20-30% are in prison, and the rest are stuck in <$10/hr jobs probably for the rest of their lives.<p>Of those who could move elsewhere (not rich, mind you, just well-to-do enough to move to a different city in CA, like say Sacramento or San Bernadino), most have decent middle class blue collar jobs (~$40k). About 10% of the group that was better off ended up going to college, and I would count myself amongst maybe 5 people (out of a class of ~400) that have truly jumped class barriers.<p>When you can only afford to live in one place, you are limited by the options of that one place. Even tiny increments in income/wealth open up exponentially greater opportunities, for the sole reason that they allow you to move elsewhere. For this reason, I concur 100% with Yglesias&#x27; theory: Housing regulation and laws, which have a disproportionate effect on housing affordability, are a huge impediment to class mobility.<p>Seattle, I hope you shape up before you turn into San Francisco.

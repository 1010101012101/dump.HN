Everyone using docker benefits from the &quot;software distribution&quot; feature. <i>Some</i> people using docker also benefit from the security and isolation features - it depends on your needs and the security profile of your application. Because the underlying namespacing features of the kernel are still young, it&#x27;s recommended to avoid running untrusted code as root inside a container on a shared machine. If you drop privileges inside the container, use an additional layer of security like SELinux, grsec, apparmor etc. then it is absolutely possible and viable in production.<p>It&#x27;s only a matter of time before linux namespaces get more scrutiny and people grow more comfortable with them as a first-class security mechanism. It took a while for OpenVZ to get there, but not there are hosting providers using it for VPS offerings.<p>On top of namespacing, docker manages other aspects of the isolation including firewalling between containers and the outside world (currently optional but soon to be mandatory), whitelisting of traffic between certain containers, etc.",1385477950

And they are useful as currency because they have good properties as a medium of exchange:  They are scarce, homogeneus, difficult to fake, easy to identify (this could be improved), easy to transport, divisible, etc.  The perceived utilitiy of these properties is what makes Bitcoins valuable. Purchasing power is a consequence of utility, not the opposite.<p>It would make the BitCoins value more stable if they could be used for a non monetary purpose.  Maybe some cryptographic application?  I think that it would be a good idea for the BitCoin community to research for a non monetary utility for the BitCoins.<p>As long as BitCoins don´t have a non monetary utility, Mises followers are correct when they say that if BitCoins loses its currency status, then their value would drop to zero, the question is, how much value would also lose silver or gold if they were not used as currency or store of value anymore? BitCoins are not risk-free, as nothing in life is risk-free.  It´s a matter of choice.</i><p>Gold has been valuable for over 4.000 years, Bitcoins? 4, and that&#x27;s already longer than the Tulip Mania ;-) We&#x27;ll see how it works out but it sure is interesting.<p><a href=\"http://eleconomistaprudente.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/bitcoins-and-mises%C2%B4s-regression-theorem/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://eleconomistaprudente.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/bitcoin...</a>",1385476868

Remember, the Constitution itself was a reaction to the Articles of Confederation, which created a government that turned out to be too weak to protect peoples&#x27; safety, both from external threats (Indians, European powers) and internal threats (domestic insurgents). The Constitution draw the safety versus freedom line a little closer to &quot;safety&quot; by creating a more powerful, more centralized federal government.<p>This balancing is also why the 4th amendment uses the wiggle word &quot;unreasonable.&quot; Searches and seizures are okay, just not &quot;unreasonable&quot; ones. Well how do you decide what is &quot;reasonable&quot; versus &quot;unreasonable?&quot; You figure out how to appropriately trade-off freedom versus security! If the founding fathers didn&#x27;t intend for us to engage in such balancing, they would&#x27;ve left out the word &quot;unreasonable.&quot; No searches and seizures, even if necessary to solve a murder or kidnapping.

Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.”<p>1.1 How would Martians looking at ProofOfWork brute force SHA256 hashing and cryptographic scarcity feel any different?<p>2. “The problem with commodities is that you are betting on what someone else would pay for them in six months. The commodity itself isn’t going to do anything for you….it is an entirely different game to buy a lump of something and hope that somebody else pays you more for that lump two years from now than it is to buy something that you expect to produce income for you over time.”<p>2.1. Gold is inherently speculative. So is bitcoins, as a currency; with the caveat that it only exists if the p2p network still exists, if not there is absolutely no actual use for btc.<p>3. “Gold is a way of going long on fear, and it has been a pretty good way of going long on fear from time to time. But you really have to hope people become more afraid in a year or two years than they are now. And if they become more afraid you make money, if they become less afraid you lose money, but the gold itself doesn’t produce anything.&quot;<p>3.1 IMHO bitcoins as a currency could not have emerged in any other time than in a time where the governments of the world are on a serious QE binge in a desperate bid to prevent a double dip and an extremely damageable deflation era, like the 33-39 one, that can only be resolved by the reset a global conflict brings. If we can snap out(inflate out) of the current slump, bitcoins as a currency will not hold up, nor will gold. Gold is already on the decline...<p>4. “I will say this about gold. If you took all the gold in the world, it would roughly make a cube 67 feet on a side…Now for that same cube of gold, it would be worth at today’s market prices about $7 trillion – that’s probably about a third of the value of all the stocks in the United States…For $7 trillion…you could have all the farmland in the United States, you could have about seven Exxon Mobils (XOM) and you could have a trillion dollars of walking-around money…And if you offered me the choice of looking at some 67 foot cube of gold and looking at it all day, and you know me touching it and fondling it occasionally…Call me crazy, but I’ll take the farmland and the Exxon Mobils.”<p>4.1 This is a key point for all the speculators out there. You will get burned. Buy solid earnings of management-owned moat-protected business. Invest in startups. Invest in brains. Dont get burned by this artificial bubble and the prospect of easy money. There is no such thing. Talk to all the house flippers. They were holding concrete: hard assets; protected solid future earnings is where value is. Growth in in brains.<p>5. “The major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other assets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however, has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some industrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of soaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end.”<p>5.1 Gold is safer than bitcoins in the fact that it does not depend on an honest p2p network to exist individually.<p>6. “What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis. As &#x27;bandwagon&#x27; investors join any party, they create their own truth — for a while.&quot;<p>6.1 This is the same for bitcoins, if when the expansion of demand comes to an end the whiplash is going to hurt. The bc protocol is a very interesting concept that IMHO will certainly find a use, and as such the POW will have a value; but it will eventually be indexed to the actual energy costs and expected future earnings.<p>7. “I have no views as to where it will be, but the one thing I can tell you is it won’t do anything between now and then except look at you. Whereas, you know, Coca-Cola (KO) will be making money, and I think Wells Fargo (WFC) will be making a lot of money and there will be a lot — and it’s a lot — it’s a lot better to have a goose that keeps laying eggs than a goose that just sits there and eats insurance and storage and a few things like that.&quot;<p>7.1 The goose is running miners. That opportunity is long gone for btc. If you are interested and fired up about bitcoin, I would suggest investing in a bitcoin startup. That&#x27;s your best bet; investing in brains. Not things. Esp. not virtual things.<p>Cheers and good luck!",1385476044

As others have written, the government surveillance agencies essentially saw what private industry was doing and said &quot;I want a copy of that.&quot;<p>I think we need to rethink some things:<p>1. In the short term, one of the biggest changes that has to be addressed is the current court doctrine that privacy has not been violated if no people are actually looking at the data.  Given that much of the surveillance is directed by automation, we need to recast that doctrine to include some of the automated analysis of the data. It&#x27;s a thorny question, and one that will take some time and effort to get right, but there&#x27;s no time like now to start.<p>2. We need more forceful and more transparent oversight of surveillance.  There is a risk that the surveilled might change their tactics based on lessons from oversight reporting, but it seems clear at this point that the trade off is necessary. To quote the editorial: &quot;The usefulness of the bulk collection program has been greatly exaggerated. We have yet to see any proof that it provides real, unique value in protecting national security.&quot;  Trade-offs are only worth making if you get something.  Time to revisit the trade-off.<p>3. We need to address both the big piles of data in the government&#x27;s hands and those in private hands.  This is going to require rethinking ownership of the data, and probably moving the US more towards an EU-style privacy directive. Again, a longer process, but one that needs to start now.<p>4. As a country, we need to start toward a more rational view of terrorism risk.  Plenty has been written about how disproportional our response has been.  Time to rebalance the scales.<p>In the end, we&#x27;re going to continue to have big piles of surveillance data as long as we continue our technology trajectory.  We need to start figuring out how to work with it, rather than try to stop it.",1385475953

That is, if you use the same means of communication as available in 1776 you&#x27;ll have just as much freedom as they did.  But in 2013 you have much more freedom to communicate over various mediums.  Your freedom has increased by a factor of x, but surveillance has decreased that freedom by a factor of y (where y is much less than x).  The net gain is still positive, but less than unsurveilled access.<p>An interesting thought experiment is how well would an airline that does no security checks do versus one that does.  Lets ignore the efficacy of security checks, and say that you&#x27;re 10x more likely to die in the flight w/o security checks -- would most people be willing to endure the security checks (as they are today) for a 10x reduction in deaths (imagine the baseline is the number of deaths we see today).

If the developer community gets contacted by commercial vendors, then either create a special license for the respective vendor, or have a general one for those type of cases.<p>But always use a license that prevents people selling your work as theirs.",1385474548

They were originally (quietly) implemented by ISPs when the government made it clear that they could cooperate, or they could have it made law and far more expensive to implement. The list of sites to block are currently maintained by the Internet Watch Foundation, with the aim of preventing access to child abuse, but could quite easily be expanded to cover other things.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanfeed_(content_blocking_system)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanfeed_(content_blocking_sys...</a>",1385474528

I don&#x27;t think that our political institutions have dealt with the changes in the media well.<p>The ideology that inspired the construction of these safety nets is gone for the most part -- we&#x27;ve degraded to bread and circuses.

(I would definitely want some)  Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.<p>I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value.  But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something.<p>(I&#x27;m using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply)",1385474502

Just check how much gold is sitting in vaults and not being sent to factories. If it&#x27;s only demanded for production, then the price would be much-much lower.<p>Bitcoin has many uses too, not only for reservation demand. It has scripts to protect contracts without expensive court system, blockchain can be used as a secure timestamp service, or a global name registry.

The NSA can figure out how to do a join between all the different databases Google has to uniquely identify you and Google will not ask you for consent on that. What Google is trying to do is combine the info from various services to get better targeted ads. Is that exactly a tragedy or an invasion of privacy?

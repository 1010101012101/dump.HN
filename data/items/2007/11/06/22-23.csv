76797,comment,76630,76630,0,0,mrtron,,,"I am going to be a complete fool and say the opposite.\nStarting up is easier than everyone says.<p>Reasons?\nThe cost is really low.  You don't have to quit your job.  You don't have to invest a lot into your company.  If things start to do well, you can afford to do both.\nWhat really is the cost?  The cost is your time, and if it is something you enjoy, its a win-win situation.\nAm I defining a hobby?  Sure, but starting up can be exactly that.  There are advantages to quitting your job and investing every penny you can, but that isn't for everyone.<p>So starting up is really easy.  Write some code, release a project.  If it doesn't do well, it was fun.  If it does do well, keep the ball rolling.<p>If you can't get anything started while you are working full time, I would suggest you will be unsuccessful if you quit your job too.  ",1194389623

Most of the ideas I've had solve problems in $100M to $500M markets.<p>Should we be going after $1B+?<p>Obviously it depends how much market share you can capture and at what cost, but is there are rule of thumb that if you want to achieve any kind of success (i.e. fuck-you money) you have to have the potential to bring in $XM+ in revenues?

It seems like you spend your time in either San Fransisco or Cambridge, two incredibly democratic locations. Of course you're going to hear people bash Bush incredibly passionately. Nobody likes Bush, not even in red states, so I can only imagine that's amplified where you are. <p>I can tell you that I sling code for a living and I'm very interested in the whole Ron Paul thing; I didn't hear about him from Digg or Reddit, I heard about him from the signs I see people holding every day on my way home from work so I looked him up on Google. <p>I think a lot more hackers lean libertarian than you give credit for.

76786,comment,76626,76626,0,0,geebee,,,"Mr. Aron keeps saying ""so get out of IT and do something else"". <p>That's the problem - the H1B visa is constructed to create a class of people who <i>can't</i> get out of IT and do something else.  The terms of the visa even make it challenging to stay in IT and merely start working for a different large corporation.<p>I want to make it very clear that I am 100% behind the notion of silicon valley as a desination for entrepreneurs from all over the world.  That said, I'm pretty disgusted with a visa that allows Oracle to control an employee's right to reside in the US, or the employee's application for a green card.<p>I think the H1B visa is the visa that says ""we'll let you into the US to <i>work</i> for Oracle, but we won't let you into the US to <i>compete</i> with Oracle.  <p>Paul G wrote about this in an essay about ""how to be silicon valley"".  If another country created a better worker visa - one that respected the need for personal and economic freedom, it could gain a real competitive advantage over silicon valley.  America's idiotic skilled worker program is probably SV's achilles heel.  <p>I read an article about how some H1B holders are getting so frustrated with the green card wait that they have started looking to other countries to start businesses - I think it was in businessweek (sorry I can't give a link).  I don't think this is enough to knock SV out of the top spot, but it is a place where a competing city in another country could score some points.    ",1194388441
76785,comment,45698,45698,0,0,jamesthudson,,,"Very insightful.  In my long corporate experience, corporate management refuses to acknowledge that writing software is a creative act of a creative brain.  In fact, before my early retirement, they came in with something called methodology, which treated programming as something that you could script so that programmers could be interchangeable.  The result, which I predicted, was that both morale and productivity sank to new lows.  Just another sign that the beancounters just do not trust creative thinkers.  When I programmed, my best work was done at night when there were no interruptions.\n",1194388379

Something the size of a piece of paper doesn't seem big, but it'll certainly feel big if you've been moving your hands all over it for a couple hours.  <p>Most people set up their mouse so that a few inches of hand movement will take the cursor from one side of the screen to the other.  Having the size of a movement scale 1:1 to its on-screen representation would get tiring pretty quickly.",1194386463

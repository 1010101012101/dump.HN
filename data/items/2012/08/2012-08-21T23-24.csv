Learning a new window system is always taxing on the brain because our brains code repeated movements into our muscles so we don't have to think about them, when you change the rules and have to re-train muscle memory its harsh. I give the guy credit for giving it 8 months.<p>That said, on the 'preview' edition I loaded you could simply turn off the UI formerly known as Metro which gave you a kind of windows 7 plus experience.

Even today, I'm convinced that I understand and remember information better when I can hold an actual book in my hand as I read.<p>Long before internet access was available for what the NSF used to call ""commercial traffic"", we were already connected to each other through store and forward networks like uucpnet, FidoNet (fight-o-net), and WWIVnet.<p>Instead of an ISP, you'd connect by modem to a BBS (TAG BBS ftw!).  And for most BBSs, only one person could connect at a time.  If you were a user that meant you'd have your terminal program (Telix was my favorite) set to keep redialing across several BBSs till you connected to one.  Sometimes you'd be redialing for most of the early evening before your modem squawked and squealed which meant you'd finally gotten in.<p>The BBS itself, was just some hobbyists computer.  And the Sysop (system operator/owner) may or may not have participated in one of the aforementioned store and forward networks.  If not, there would be local discussion boards, file download areas, and usually a few doors (games).  Popular games I ran on my BBS were Tradewars and Geopolitics -- and like everything else, it was multiuser but only one person at any given time.<p>Being a Sysop had three main benefits: [1] it was fun; [2] US Robotics gave you a sweet deal on a high-speed modem; [3] whenever you were sitting there connecting to other BBSs (thus tying up the line) people just assumed the busy signal meant your board was more popular than it was.<p>For those of us who were writing software, there were usenet newsgroups like comp.lang.c and FidoNet echos like 'the c echo' where we could discuss and trade code with people around the world.<p>But honestly, I spent far more time reading talk.bizarre than doing useful C-related stuff.<p>That little edge though -- having easy access to other people from all over the world, made me seem far smarter at work than I really was.

4415366,comment,4415076,4415076,6,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I'm not totally sure I have the credentials to chime in, since I'm relatively young -- just under 35 -- but I got started really early (in the second grade on a Commodore Vic-20), and I spent a lot of time on various dial-up BBS services and worked on some Unisys big iron in the East Bay.<p>So: I really miss that, honestly, and some of my energy recently has been spent on trying to figure out how to bring some of that back.<p>With the Commodore Vic-20 and 64, it didn't do anything at all unless you programmed it or loaded a tape into it. With that setup, programming it was the game; it was what you did for fun. And there was almost no abstraction, very little complication. You could play around with making sounds or colors or your own simple racing car game just by sitting down and typing into it. Instead of the internet, I lurked around the local library for game magazines with source code listings in the back.<p>The dial-up BBSs were similar, in a sense, in that you couldn't really do anything else while you were on them. I find that I can waste spectacular amounts of time today by sort of ""half-working"" -- I write a couple of lines of code, get bored, hit alt-tab to bring up my always-open web browser, get a fix of internet for twenty minutes, then switch back to the code and try to bang out a few more lines. That's an awful way to get anything done. With the dial-ups, you knew you were wasting time, and you didn't tend to do it for more than a couple of hours before you wanted to go back and write something again. There were still trolls and such, so I can't really say that the community was any better.<p>In the earlier days of the internet, websites were less real-time, and software didn't get in your way as much. The OS was simpler. Macs had MacsBug, which you could use to easily debug your own software without dealing with an IDE's buggy interpreter, or you could use to easily investigate someone else's software. To me, it felt more like I was dealing directly with the machine, instead of having to deal with someone else's software, which in turn is dealing with someone else's software, and so on until there's a machine somewhere at the end that I can no longer get to. (I worry that UEFI is only going to make this worse.) One of my first for-fun projects on my own Mac was directly accessing the ADB system to make the lights on my keyboard blink back and forth like the Knight Rider car. (I wasn't allowed to do that kind of thing on my parents' computers. :-)<p>I can't really say there was anything fun about the mainframe. It had the best recovery systems I've seen on any operating system so far; you could start a payroll and an accounting job (typically things that you didn't want to mess up), walk over to the wall, yank the cord out, plug it back in, and it would start back up right where it left off. That was impressive. And as geophile says, you generally rolled your own for everything. For most things, the easiest way to get software onto the mainframe was to write it from scratch. Since it was a business-purpose-only machine, it didn't get in your way too much about that, so that really wasn't that big of a deal. A major payroll job rewrite might be a couple of hundred lines of COBOL. There were deep, scary places in the machine with lots of code written by greybeards, but you never went there.<p>People actually seemed to share more -- little bits of code for various goodies were popular on early ""internets"" like eWorld. There are plenty of Javascript snippet sites now, so I'm not sure in what way it seems like people shared more, but it does seem different. Maybe it was different in that people seemed less motivated by gathering attention; they just wanted to share code because it was fun. People wanted to trade Legos so that they could build cooler things, not because they wanted to be the next Legoland and make some ad money. (I wonder what J5iverson is up to these days?)<p>People didn't give you shit for doing something like writing your own memory manager. They never said, ""Why don't you just use _____, it's what everyone else does.""<p>Programming seemed a lot more rewarding, though I can't honestly say whether that's just because I do it for a job now and that means often having to do it when I don't feel like it. But, programming was rewarding for programming's sake, not for the end result. Programming was a way to learn more about the machine. It was a way to make electronics do what you wanted them to. It was a way to see if you could change or improve the way that something worked, rather than just trying to create a new product or end result. (One of my prized possessions -- and one of the very few that has survived my cross-country moves and purges of stuff -- is a copy of Tricks of the Mac Game Programming Gurus, a hefty volume full of source code, with a CD full of even more stuff.)<p>In the early days of the web, people curated their sites. They didn't keep blogs, they had big index pages with links to stuff they thought was important. It was rarely topical. It didn't require, or even really want, your attention all the time. There was more incentive to creating centralized repositories of information on a subject. There was no such thing as advertising, you just did it because you wanted to be helpful. (And maybe because you were a bit of a hoarder.) People bragged about writing their sites in Notepad. All the cool kids used Perl. Again, these were things that mostly did what you told them to do, instead of spending time fiddling around with icky CSS and browser issues. I still didn't like it as much as the BBSs though.<p>Everything just seemed less opaque. Trouble with a modem? Open up a ZTerm or similar, and directly ask the modem what the hell was wrong, as long as you knew the magic incantations. Program die on a Mac and lock up the system? Hit the programmer's interrupt switch (command-power on the keyboard, or a tiny switch on the back of the machine), and type, ""SM 0 A9F4"" into the box that appeared on the screen, followed by, ""G 0"", to directly write the address of the _exitToShell trap to memory location 0 and continue execution from there. Buggy program on a Mac? Fire it up, get as close to the bug as possible, fire up MacsBug, rewrite its code in realtime until it behaved, take notes, and then open the program (or its resource file) in your favorite hex-like editor and make your changes permanent on your copy. Hard to do that with ""the cloud"". A home computer or a mainframe could do anything that you wanted it to, and it wasn't unreasonable to make it do anything, because it seemed to take so much less time and effort.<p>Well, rose-colored glasses and all. And, it's not that all the advancements we've made since then, in terms of abstraction and performance and communication and so on are bad.<p>It just seems less fun.",1345592368

And of course we've discussed it, openly amongst the entire team as well as behind closed doors with our board and counsel.  It does complicate things.  In the end we felt like the positives (having Michelle on the team so we can take advantage of her strengths) outweigh the potential negatives.  It could absolutely turn out badly.  As with almost everything else in startups, we're making a hedged bet.  And you're free to think we've made a mistake, of course, as long as you don't leave believing we haven't thought a ton about this. :)<p>It would be different if we were inserting Michelle into some rigid organization structure, especially if she was reporting to somebody other than our CEO.  We don't have that kind of structure, though, and even if we did, we would never tell a frontline manager to hire somebody based on nepotism.  That's a sure-fire way to kill a company in my book.",1345592317

I don't have a car, so just physically carrying $500/mo of groceries to my apartment would be quite an effort! I can't imagine how I'd do that unless I bought mainly stuff with a really high price:weight ratio, like steak or something, which I do occasionally, but don't eat as a staple food.<p>Today, for example, I carried what seemed like an uncomfortably heavy set of bags, yet it only came out to about $30, and will probably last me the rest of the week: 2 lbs pork tenderloin (2x $5), 5 lbs potatoes ($3), 2 lbs tomatoes ($4), 1 lb lentils ($3), 2 lbs onions ($2), 1 head broccoli ($1), 12x eggs ($3), 2 lbs nectarines ($3).<p>I think I more often run into the problem of buying way more than I can carry/eat, and it <i>still</i> doesn't cost much. I mean, I like nectarines, but 2 pounds of nectarines is a lot to finish before they get overripe, so some of that might get wasted.

One time might have been a case where a folder with lots of small files got moved away and Dropbox only allows single file restore, which would have taken hours, possibly longer than the lost work. Once I've done something stupid where I wanted to exchange a whole Dropbox folder with a different version. I switched off the client on one PC (by mistake, obviously) and exchanged the folder on the other, then switched it on again. Then I became aware the the old folder had important stuff in it. The versioning was corrupted at that point, many old files would either not show up online or would produce an error message.<p>So usually there is some user behaviour involved, yes.

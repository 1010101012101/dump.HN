7991862,comment,7991614,7991614,2,0,jasim,,,"It isn&#x27;t surprising that we are most happy when we are able to forget ourselves.<p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&#x27;s book &#x27;Flow - The Psychology of Optimal Experience&#x27; talks about optimal experiences. He has found that humans are generally happy in what is termed as a &#x27;flow&#x27; experience. Activities in which we immerse ourselves fully, temporarly forgetting ourselves, like programming, are flow experiences.<p>A few relevant quotes from the book:<p>&quot;So loss of self-consciousness does not involve a loss of self, and certainly not a loss of consciousness, but rather, only a loss of consciousness of the self. What slips below the threshold of awareness is the concept of self, the information we use to represent to ourselves who we are. And being able to forget temporarily who we are seems to be very enjoyable. When not preoccupied with our selves, we actually have a chance to expand the concept of who we are. Loss of self-consciousness can lead to self-transcendence, to a feeling that the boundaries of our being have been pushed forward.&quot;<p>&quot;The similarities between Yoga and flow are extremely strong; in fact it makes sense to think of Yoga as a very thoroughly planned flow activity. Both try to achieve a joyous, self-forgetful involvement through concentration, which in turn is made possible by a discipline of the body.&quot;<p>&quot;When a family has a common purpose and open channels of communication, when it provides gradually expanding opportunities for action in a setting of trust, then life in it becomes an enjoyable flow activity. Its members will spontaneously focus their attention on the group relationship, and to a certain extent forget their individual selves, their divergent goals, for the sake of experiencing the joy of belonging to a more complex system that joins separate consciousnesses in a unified goal.&quot;",1404568799
7991861,comment,7989969,7990799,1,0,Zigurd,,,"> <i>also a more reasonable IR for a JIT or AOT backend.</i><p>It might have turned out that way but I see no evidence that DEX was designed that way from the start. The claims about DEX performance when Android first came out were that it was twice as fast as interpreted Java bytecode and half the size.<p>The Dalvik JIT compiler is a nifty design, but there is no evidence DEX was designed to make it easier or better. The JIT compiler was added years after Android shipped.<p>One can make the general claim that there is no big impediment to producing optimal compiled code from any reasonable bytecode. But I have yet to see anything indicating DEX was designed for compilation or confers any advantages on any compiler design.",1404568743

7991856,comment,7989969,7990732,1,0,rst,,,"Not in the Android performance picture so far:  language runtimes (e.g., jruby and groovy) that dynamically generate bytecode.  A JIT can optimize it (and for jruby and grovvy on the jvm, it typically does).<p>That hasn&#x27;t been an issue on Android so far because those language runtimes would have had to be retooled to generate Dalvik bytecode, and none of them were.  (Ruboto, jruby on Android, runs in pure interpreted mode, with a significant performance hit.)  But I believe that with Dalvik, it was technically possible.  Does ART just close this possibility off?",1404568671

7991852,comment,7986764,7989379,1,0,grey-area,,,"Thanks for the clarification. Perhaps the operative distinction here is between parasitic and symbiotic corporations. Ideally they are symbiotic with other players in the eocsystem, rather than parasitic, but I think all corporations have a temptation and a tendency to end up as parasitic monopolies.<p>Re Google, I wasn&#x27;t saying they don&#x27;t create value, far from it, I was saying they don&#x27;t create value <i>for readers</i> with <i>advertising</i>. I concede this is a debatable point though for the reasons you mentioned, and it is really a subjective. Personally I don&#x27;t find their advertising useful, and if anything think it targets me mostly with sites I&#x27;ve already engaged with and wastes the money of advertisers. There is a tension in their services because they depend on advertising, and the temptation (which thy have increasingly given in to on their search service recently) is to favour advertisers (the real customers) over end users - a classic problem in a two-sided market.<p>To be clear though, I was not saying google are evil, but that <i>just shifting the value around</i> is what businesses do and what Google does - <i>creating value</i> is a very slippery and subjective concept and I&#x27;d argue their services which create value (mail etc) are funded by those that don&#x27;t (advertising). So I would not use that particular behaviour as a criticism of the companies mentioned in the article - they might be objectionable, immoral or even illegal (I&#x27;d say probably all three) but they are not easy to distinguish from normal businesses in terms of how they shift value around.",1404568630

7991847,comment,7991614,7991614,1,0,joshvm,,,"Of course the journal article isn&#x27;t open access. But hey, Google.<p>&quot;To see whether the difficulty with “just thinking” is distinctive to college students, in study 9 we recruited community participants at a farmer’s market and a local church. The par- ticipants ranged in age from 18 to 77 (median age = 48.0 years). As in study 7, they completed the study online in their own homes, after receiving instructions to do so when they were alone and free of any external distractions. The results were similar to those found with college students. There was no evidence that enjoyment of the thinking period was related to participants’ age, education, income, or the frequency with which they used smart phones or social media (table S2).&quot;<p>So apparently it&#x27;s not related to the prevalence of distracting technology - according to them.  I would question the second (S8) &#x27;at home&#x27; studies which only used 15 people per experiment.  This was to test whether allowing participants to distract themselves had any effect.<p>It&#x27;s a very short paper, only a couple of pages, so I think needs a bit more digging to actually find out whether it&#x27;s true or not.

I don&#x27;t think Rich was referring to what I am. He was talking about the trouble composing Java concurrency using locks and such, which is just hard.<p>On the other hand with clojure, a standard mix is to use non blocking IO to multiplex a large number of connections, then delegate work to a threadpool (using clojure refs/atoms etc.). Such a system has a much smaller chance of deadlocks and other issues.<p>A great example of polyglot concurrency is the clojure reducers framework that lets you delegate work to a fork/join pool. Most people don&#x27;t need it, but it&#x27;s nice to have a safe, seamless interface to such an advanced concurrency tool.",1404568440

If you personally save your money in treasuries, it&#x27;s still considered savings. This is not different.<p>We&#x27;re using a different definition of savings. I mean savings as in not-consuming. By this sense, investing in treasuries is only &#x27;saving&#x27; in the grander scale if the government doesn&#x27;t spend the money, or if it invests it. If the government uses it for consumption or in transfer payments to people who then use it for consumption, it&#x27;s ultimately not &#x27;saved&#x27;, it&#x27;s consumed. This means that when the original saver gets the money back, they&#x27;re not getting the money they saved, they&#x27;re actually receiving a transfer payment, as the money (value) they saved no longer exists.<p>This is why American social security could potentially &quot;run dry&quot;[1], which wouldn&#x27;t happen in a system where people only got back exactly what they put in (plus interest) and the money wasn&#x27;t used for anything else.<p>>Why would preserving wealth differences be important to a forced savings scheme?<p>If you&#x27;re not &#x27;preserving wealth differences&#x27;, you&#x27;re transferring money to people who didn&#x27;t originally earn it.

There was an article in it that caught my eye, &quot;Why do dumb people succeed more in business than smart people.&quot;<p>I dont remember exactly the title but it was an 8 to 10 page article that went into detail comparing high IQ people to average or low IQ people and why people with lower average IQ did better in business. The article was filled with graphs and case studies and was very interesting.<p>But the last paragraph really summarized it best, &quot;Smart people consistently over analyzed risk and talked themselves out of taking risks while someone with a lower IQ didnt even think about the risk and jumped in with both feet and took chances.&quot;<p>It gets back to the saying &quot;No risk / No reward&quot;.<p>I remember that article to this day and always do a gut check when it comes to evaluating new risks. Sometimes I second voice my old European grandfather who was all about hard work in a different industry but his life lessons hold true.<p>Turning off the brain chatter and clearly evaluating a situation is critical but it s very hard because intelligent people, and humans in general, like to avoid risk and the temporary unpleasant pain that accompanies it.",1404566108

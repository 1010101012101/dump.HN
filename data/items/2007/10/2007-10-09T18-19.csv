65393,comment,65327,65327,0,0,carter,,,"Hey, dude! You right. Never surrender.
I'm 21 from Novosibirsk, Russia. When I decided to start the startup it was REALLY hard to find co-founders. I thought that my friends will join me. But they was too scared about the need to drop out the college and do something cool and undiscovered. Other often very smart people in Russia already had thier reliable jobs....And one day suddenly I found not one but two co-founders! One of them found me from my ad at some RoR website. The second co-founder was found by me from his blog. The are really cool guys and I'm enjoying working with them. One of them from Denver and the other from Dublin, Ireland. So, we are distributed across the globe)<p>You right, I couldn't ever imagine where I'll find co-founders.<p>More. I met a lot of cool smart people in Silicon Valley and in the US. I even found one Russian guy who moved to US 9 years ago.<p>This SOOOO exciting! And the things become more and more interesting.<p>I hope we meet one day and eat that sushi)<p>Good luck :)",1191955855

Also, to apply twice there must be some level of commitment to the startup ethos. You aren't just applying on a whim -- a startup is something you genuinely want to do.<p>At least, this is what I hope Paul Graham thinks, as I'm applying for the second time myself. ::grin::",1191955161

65374,comment,65329,65361,0,0,whacked_new,,,"There are two ways to look at this. First as an embellishment to ordinary communication methods (which includes email). That would be a more entertainment-focused product, which may be interesting.<p>The other direction, which I hope is not what you are hinting at, is a universal mapping of words to pictures. From what I know, historically and theoretically, this is impossible. For one, universal language attemps have failed (esperanto being the largest ever and it's a dud). For two, not all word forms have concrete representations (try meta-concepts, the concept that represents, and even ""meta-concepts"" itself). For three, Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis</a><p>Language is a statistical thing; every new utterance communicated adds more data to the pool. Hence, even while there are dictionaries, the very second a definition is written down, if somebody uses the word, the definition is no longer perfect. In conjunction, there will never be a ""best match"" picture for a word.<p>If this is really your idea, consider not doing voting on pictures, but rather making a gigantic, associative map of words across languages. That will have immense educational value.",1191953591

Does it hurt to apply more than once? That is, once you get dinged, is there some sort of ""uh-oh, it's that guy again"" that happens the next time around? Or do each time you get treated like it's your first time up?<p>
I'd like experience applying, if nothing else. But I don't have a co-founder and don't want to hurt my future chances by using up any of my ""free karma"" on a long-shot application.",1191953327

65367,comment,65329,65361,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"That's true. Look at advertisements, which use images to appeal to people who aren't fond of text. For example, beer companies use images of attractive, smiling people, beer, and women with enormous breasts to vividly explain that beer will make you feel good. If you're transmitting a similarly primitive message to your Senegalese pen pal, a series of images is the way to go. But if you want to know what it's like to talk about politics using just images, read up on Pakistan's recent election, and take a look at all the people waving placards with Musharraf's mug on them. That's what happens when you want to 'talk' about complex issues without using big (or any!) words.",1191953169

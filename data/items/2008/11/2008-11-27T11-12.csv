How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live-did live, from habit that became instinct-in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.""<p>-1984",1227786876

Say some megalomaniac thinks it'd be much more convenient to have a bunch of friendly AIs around than a human population prone to revolt.  In that case, friendly AI is not so great since it disrupts the power balance.",1227784378

It is an Important Work.<p>On the other books, it depends on what you want.  Alternatives to Date include Jeffrey Ullman, ""Principles of Database and knowledge-base Systems"" and ""Foundations of Databases"" by Abiteboul, Hull and Vianu.<p>As an introductory book, I like Database: Principles, Programming, Performance by Patrick O'Neil.<p>For more on transaction processing, as well as Jim Gray there is Philip Bernstein, eg ""Principles of Transaction Processing"".<p>Following the references is a lot of fun; see where you end up.",1227783618

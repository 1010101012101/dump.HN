1489594,comment,1489166,1489166,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This reads like a textbook, i.e. it's algorithms that are highly useful to CS professors and students but not necessarily to practitioners.  If I had to pick a top-10 list based on my professional experience, it would be:<p>1. Tree traversal.  This comes up <i>all the time</i>, from directory walks to DOM traversal to code analysis to folds over abstract data types.  It's also something that you need to know and can't always rely on having a library function for, because many things exhibit tree-like structure without actually being instances of your language's Tree data type.<p>2. Hashing.  Obviously as a base for hashtables (which are often your dictionary data structure of choice), but also as a general technique for generating a small fingerprint from a large set of data.<p>3. Statistics - mean/median/mode, but also things like confidence intervals, regressions, sample sizes, how to make sure your populations unbiased, etc..  You are evaluating your product, right?  Knowing how to make good inferences from data is critical, particularly since there're lots of ways you can do it wrong.<p>4. Sorting.  This can usually be hidden behind a library function, but it's useful to understand because many other algorithms have very different (and often better) performance characteristics if the input data is kept sorted.  Binary search falls into this bullet point too.<p>5. Data compression algorithms.  Another one that you'll rarely have to directly implement, but knowing their characteristics helps you make good speed/space tradeoffs for the rest of the system.<p>6. Bloom filters.  This is one that I never learned in school but tends to be incredibly useful when dealing with massive data sets.  Oftentimes, you want to be able to quickly <i>reject</i> elements if they're <i>not</i> in a set, but don't really care about it taking a while if they <i>are</i> in a set (because you expect that many more elements will be outside of the set than inside it).  A Bloom filter is one of the fastest, most space-efficient ways to do this.<p>7. Topological sort.  Dependency graphs come up all the time in practical programming problems, and usually you want a way to linearize them into a list of tasks that you can perform in order.  It's also a shame that many languages' standard libraries don't have a topological sort function, so oftentimes you <i>will</i> have to implement this one yourself.<p>8. Support vector machines.  These are your bread & butter machine-learning classifiers, and are really nice to know when you've got a bunch of data and want to try to automate some rote classification job.<p>9. Physics simulations.  I've found it surprising how useful my intro physics course knowledge has been.  Things like vectors, position vs. velocity vs. acceleration, damped harmonic oscillators, FFTs, etc.  It's most useful when building UIs and games - oftentimes, you can make a UI feel significantly more natural by adding easing functions that behave like acceleration when you ease in and frictional damping when you ease out.<p>10. Unification.  I'm probably biased because a lot of my hobby programming is in compilers & type systems, but unification comes up all the time in compilers, and is a really general technique for equation solving.",1278377578

And for now, Windows offers the easiest way of doing things, because everything works on it because a manufacturer will never release something that doesn't work on the general swath of Windows computers.<p>Pretty much the entire appeal of Mac is a) no viruses/spyware (because nobody writes viruses or spyware for Mac because its userbase is too insignificant to target) and b) big icons and prettier colors, making it ""easier"" to use.<p>Windows is an institution.

In the case of ""starving the world's poor"", it's because farmers need to pay for seeds and fertilizer and land, and because we have to fly the food to the starving children in airplanes, which cost money.<p>The futures angle also affects the price; the investment banks need money for taking risk away from the farmers.  This affects the price of the futurers, but it also decreases the actual price of the crop, since the farmer no longer has to take on the risk of a bad growing season.  The investment bank deals with risk, the farmer deals with food, and everyone gets a cut.<p>Less risk for the farmer means more incentive to produce food, ensuring that we do actually have enough food for everyone.  (Why does everyone in the US grow corn?  Not because corn is inherently delicious or useful, but because the government give them money for doing it.

That's a better deal for the consumer <i>if</i> they want something popular or amateur (in the sense of something created for love rather than profit). But as it's become the dominant model (and as it was preceded by big-box discount stores, particularly in the book trade), publishers focused on a smaller number of big selling authors, and there was correspondingly less cross-subsidizing of niche or starting authors that didn't have as much mass appeal, at least in the short term.<p>It's harder for a new or specialized writer to get into print than it used to be, because publishers can no longer afford to front the cost of keeping their books in print while waiting for them to gain traction based on an editor's instinct about literary quality. Not that I think there's anything wrong with publishing on the internet, or that making money is the only valid metric of an author's quality, but while some writers develop more slowly than others they still need to pay the bills. I like science fiction, for example, and over the last 30 years the variety and quantity of writers and subjects on the shelves has declined as publishers prefer their established moneymakers, or stories that can be marketed as trilogies, and so forth. Thanks to the success of that <i>Twilight</i> series, for example, my local Borders seems to have devoted a good quarter of the sci-fi/fantasy section to books about young vampires in love.<p>I'm just saying that a lot of niche-specific marketing and editorial infrastructure has fallen apart as the industry has shifted course, and made it more difficult for some producers and consumers to find each other. That publishing infrastructure looked superfluous from a business perspective and so many large publishers cut those departments to remain competitive, but business is notoriously focused on the short term. MBA logic would argue against committing resources to publishing, say, the first novel of a contemporary Burroughs or Joyce.<p>I don't mean this is a disaster of course - real talent will usually get noticed, and as mainstream publishers become more conservative (in the sense of preferring material with mass market potential) there are disruptive opportunities for small publishers and the book business in particular has been through such cycles before. Amazon is effectively the bookstore with infinite shelves so publications of minor interest aren't crowded out by flavor-of-the-month writers the way they are in bookstores.

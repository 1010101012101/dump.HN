I don't agree with that. The things I find valuable in the present might still be here, and more on top of it, if history had taken a differnt course.<p>But I never denied that some wars are justified. I'm just saying that winning them is not worth throwing out of the window all the things that we want to achieve by winning them.<p>Your logic is that by accepting defeat (in some extreme cases) instead of using torture and mass murder I also accept that these very things do in fact take hold. That's not a necessary conclusion though. Even lost wars have sometimes had the exact opposite effect of what the winner had expected. And vice versa you could win a war but lose the argument so thoroughly that the principles of your enemy prevail for generations.<p>Put differently, it is important how wars are won, not just that they are won, because wars are not the end of the world and we have to live with the consequences of how things were done in past wars.",1229183890

396727,comment,394609,396655,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"War is all about making the other person stop fighting. War has been around as long as there have been people with different opinions and the will to use force to settle them.<p>These are super-ethical issues: ie, they exist regardless of your opinion of them. I hope there is no disagreement on them.<p>Throughout history all of the techniques you mention have been used to advance society in order to put you in a position of modern life being able to make your opinion to quit fighting under certain circumstances. Since you are alive right now, and must find some value to your life, it follows that after all of these conflicts in which your rules were not followed, there was still something left that was worth fighting for. At least at the level of civilization. So it follows that you at least value the results of other people with fewer qualms than you. Otherwise you should be living in a cave by firelight -- but fire was probably stolen by force involving torture, mass killings, etc. as well, so put the torch out.<p>That's at a civilization level. At a personal level, many folks throughout history have had moral issues with various parts of war. In the United States, many many times the rest of the populace fought wars the Quakers refused to participate in. In this case, either 1) you die, 2) you submit, or 3) somebody else with fewer moral qualms fights the war for you.<p>Morals are a key part of your personal life. I just wouldn't substitute my personal morals for my greater responsibility to mankind. My personal morals might be wrong, and if morals mean anything they mean the ability to introspect and change. I'm fully prepared to be wrong and face the personal consequences to <i>me</i> if my morals tell me to do or not to do something. It becomes selfish and grossly immoral, in my opinion, to inflict consequences on others under the banner of my own self-righteousness. War is a nasty, ugly business and it should be avoided at all costs mainly because of this equation: it strips us all to the primal need to dominate or die.<p>That's just my opinion. I would not mean to judge. I've found self-righteousness on both sides of the ""just war"" discussion, and it seems to hide the greater issue of how mankind as a race reacts and suffers.",1229181774

However, physically speaking, both the replicant and my own body are identical, since particles do not have individuality, as Eliezer points out.  The ship problem is a question of whether identity obtains, whereas identity is not a question in my thought experiment.  Thus, the two do not map.",1229181001

Do you or ericb truly believe that this is the case, or are you putting me on?<p>Just because I know there are cardinalities of infinities doesn't mean that it makes sense to claim that the people use these values in their life calculations.<p>It's very simple, for example, to use arguments from the amount of money a person will accept for a more dangerous job, as byrneseyeview pointed out, to show that people value their lives as a finite number. If people valued their lives infinitely, they would accept no additional money for any increased risk of anything, ever.<p>Unless of course, people value money infinitely too, and they're doing some sort transfinite math in their heads. Which I think you'll agree is a bit surreal and total nonsense.",1229180824

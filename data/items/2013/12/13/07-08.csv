Indeed, the pleasure that entertainment affords is a straightforward signal that the brain <i>is</i> learning, without exception. Take humour. What was funny in the past is usually not funny now, because humour depends on our current state of knowledge and is a means of opening our minds to new ideas.<p>Even the pleasure that comes from addiction and drug use indicates that learning is taking place -- learning the context of the &#x27;high&#x27; (more and more subtle detail concerning the smell of the coffee, the crackle of the cigarette paper, the label of the wine being poured, the faces of one&#x27;s fellow drinkers, etc, and linking this information to the pleasure itself).<p>Contrariwise, if one is not entertained, if one cannot find some pleasurable feature in the situation, then one is learning nothing.

In context of trade, you only make money when you actually sell something people <i>want</i> and give them a good deal.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the other side of the coin. If you try to cheat or victimize others, you are actually acting against your long-term interest; you are <i>not</i> being selfish. Bernie Madoff was profoundly unselfish. He sacrificed his life.<p>Watch out for politicians and Popes who demonize selfishness; they want to interrupt others&#x27; pursuit of values for some cause which, inevitably, is ignoble.<p>The expansion of the economy, which <i>is</i> what creates opportunity, expands the labor market, and raises the standard of living, turns on allowing people to pursue their values.<p>This, and its converse, is demonstrated empirically over and over since the Industrial Revolution. People are poorer in direct proportion to how socialist their country is.

6899504,comment,6899446,6899446,4,0,karenxcheng,,,"Cache in case my blog goes down:<p>I am selfish.<p>100 days ago I got an email from a lady who had seen my viral dance video. I got lots of emails from people who wanted to learn to dance but that’s not what she wanted. She had multiple sclerosis and what she wanted was to walk again.<p>So I taught her how to use Dropbox (the very first version of 100 was files in Dropbox folders) and she started taking videos of herself learning to walk every day.<p>Today is day 100 and you can see she’s made a lot of progress: <a href=\"https://giveit100.com/@cynthia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://giveit100.com/@cynthia</a><p>When people ask me why I made the dance video (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daC2EPUh22w\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daC2EPUh22w</a>) I say it’s because I wanted people to see the invisible hard work behind talent. And that is true but you know why else I made it?<p>Because I am selfish.<p>I knew if I could make it go viral it would give me opportunity – as a dancer, as a writer, as a speaker.<p>And when I had the idea for 100 (giveit100.com) I said I wanted to build it because I wanted to help all these people. And that is true but you know why else I wanted to make it?<p>Because I am selfish.<p>You know what one of my hidden motivations was? I thought it’d be cool to write a book one day and I felt like a viral dance video wasn’t substantial enough material. But something like 100 – ohhh that would be good, that would be big, that would give me enough material for a book and I could become a nice published author.<p>Well it’s been one month since Finbarr and I launched 100. It’s been stressful and I feel burnt out and it’s tiring be constantly on.<p>And I wasn’t even going to admit that because potential investors will look for cracks and weaknesses and no doubt they are reading this very sentence right now. And they don’t like to smell weaknesses on a founder. Especially not a female one.<p>But if there’s one thing I’ve learned in the last year, it’s that ripping your weaknesses open for everyone to see is where you can draw your greatest strength. If you try to hide it, you give it power. But drag it out in the daylight and you will be liberated.<p>I am selfish.<p>But now I can see that 100 is bigger than me and it is bigger than a viral video and it is bigger than a book. If we do this right, it’s going to be the thing every person learning a musical instrument turns to. Every person learning a language. A sport. Every tinkerer toiling away on their side project. Every scared soul starting a business. Every teacher and every student. Every parent recording every child growing up – learning to talk, learning to walk. It will give people confidence, it will give people an army of others who support them, and it will give them belief in themselves.<p>How someone as selfish as me could create something that could affect so many people and make a real, practical, positive difference in the world – I don’t know. We have a long, long way to go. But we’re gonna make it happen.",1386920132

There was supposed to be an update of those figures published this July but they sat on the report until after the election. We now know that those figures are now $73 billion peak funding and 1.7 million residences passed [0].<p>> The Coalition’s NBN is a joke. It will not arrive faster, cheaper, or better.<p>It will be faster (as in, rolled out faster) and cheaper.

6899471,comment,6895502,6899358,1,0,alok-g,,,"I recall an analogy from Skiena [1], although this is not exactly what happened in my two-month to two-hour example.  Skiena talks about a problem which appears to have exponential complexity at first, but then shows an insight that turns it into polynomial time.  Consider the potential impact of this.  Team Exp will be spending lots more time optimizing, debugging, writing test cases, while the team Poly will go though all of that much faster since the task is much easier now.  Not just the running time is different, the development and maintenance time could be different by an order of magnitude too.<p>In the actual case, the team Months could not connect the dots to see that the specific problem at hand, that involved two complex things, somehow had a much simpler solution.  Their code, development time, etc. looked perfectly normal from an outsider&#x27;s point of view.  The code was taking 40 minutes per run.  I was unaware of their work and coded the same thing independently.  My code was five lines core in Matlab plus overheads, or about hundred lines total.  It also ran in two minutes.<p>In short, no one was cheating.  Nothing was amiss.  Just that I could connect the dots and they could not.  Had I not worked on the problem, I would not have figured either.<p>The issue is that in the normal course of lives, two people or teams are not asked to work on the same problem in isolation.  So the difference in performance does not become evident at least in the short run.  This is in spite of the amount of duplication of effort that often exists.<p>Now this does not imply that I could do this for every task, though I do have more examples just as profound.  I can often understand complex problems better and faster than other people, and then can work through them faster.  But if both sides understand the problem+solution equally well, I may actually be slower in implementing at least in the initial rounds.  (This is because my breadth of knowledge across technology domains is often five-ten times broader than normal engineers, which also implies that I have less practice in each domain).<p>And yes, I am chasing some really big goals.<p>[1] www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/",1386919196

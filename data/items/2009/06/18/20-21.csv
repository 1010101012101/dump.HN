664131,comment,663432,663961,0,0,sfphotoarts,,,"I didn't use the term ""unusual"" to describe your child. I used it to describe his/her behavior... there's a big difference.<p>I wouldn't say your child is unusual (I don't know him/her), but an obsession with money in a 7 year old is definitely unusual, ask any child psychologist (like my wife). 7 year olds live in a world where money is of little importance, they cannot play with it (much), they don't have any of it (to speak of) and they don't need any of it, because they have love and friends which are much more important to them.<p>The idea of a 7 year old scheming a way to game a lemonade stand to maximize monetary gain seems grotesque. A lemonade stand is a social activity, not a start-up opportunity.<p>I personally believe that money and its trappings of consumerism are like TV, they should be limited in children. I don't let my child watch much TV and I discourage her from finding money, or the collection of new shiny things interesting. There are, after all, a lot more useful and interesting things in this world that acquiring money. That is a value that I try to teach my child. Your child, your values... I'm not trying to tell you how to parent.<p>I was simply correcting the mediaman from jumping into something he clearly knows nothing about and gobbing off rules like he's some kind of school yard bully.",1245358745

664123,comment,664066,664066,0,0,sgrove,,,"I disagree on a number of points. I understand that it's a difficult subject, but to just point out one example:<p><i>""The third important point is that not all speech is equal. Some speech has direct, negative consequences. Few would argue that a person who yells “Fire!” in a crowded theatre, and causes a stampede that results in 5 deaths and 25 injuries, should not be prosecuted. As an even more immediate example, the words “Shoot him”, spoken to someone who holds a gun to your head, are obviously not good speech.""</i><p>Free speech, as I have understood it, is about communicating <i>ideas</i>. These are not ideas - these are a different creature altogether. Both are communicated via words, but they are not the same.<p>The issue with facebook is that people are voicing <i>ideas</i> - the holocaust never happened (I assume from the referenced article, I haven't cared enough about this stuff to go to the source material), etc. That should not be curtailed. That should not be limited. (Apparently) Hateful, and (to me) simply stupid ideas should be discussed and discarded. In this case it's a simple argument to make - denying the holocaust makes little to no sense whatsoever given the evidence.<p>When someone says, ""Kill the jews"", then absolutely yes, an issue outside of free speech has been raised. They are no longer communicating ideas, they are advocating dangerous activities.<p>The line for some (especially those with more emotional involvement) may be thin between the two, but it's still crucial to differentiate between them. For one, the cure is relentlessly open and frank discussion, and for the other a more mundane policing.",1245358472

664107,comment,663120,663356,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, you definitely have a better imagination than I for possible places to use this development model.  That said, the areas you've proposed, as others have mentioned, are bigger problems to solve, sometimes much bigger.  They require a lot more capital-intensive pieces to come together, or they require accurate models that don't necessarily exist.<p>Of course, that didn't stop companies from competing for the X-Prize.  So, perhaps in the areas you suggest the prize just needs to be bigger (maybe a lot bigger).  So, while an improved query optimiser for Oracle might require hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of hardware to develop, a $10 million prize would still be sufficient to interest some teams.  At <i>some</i> point, the line is crossed between what is a good development+marketing investment, and what the company could do with its own in-house developers.  I don't know if $10 million is past that line, or if it's enough incentive to bring out the geniuses in the field (the ones that don't already work for Oracle).<p>Oracle would also have the problem that they'd have to create some sort of stripped version of Oracle that only works on this one data set, or something, because otherwise they'd be giving away the biggest license of their software to any developer that signed up (because to test major improvements to Oracle, in the places that matter to Oracle, you need to be running it on big MP machinery with terabytes of data).<p>So, maybe that's why more companies haven't done it, despite the apparent cost-effectiveness and marketing value (NetFlix has probably gotten a million bucks worth of tech press out of this contest).  The cost of getting people on board might be much higher, and the cost of providing the tools to contestants may also be dramatically higher.  There may also be negative media consequences.  NetFlix spun it beautifully...such that we think of them as very smart scrappy guys and hard to beat, but also eager for a challenge from upstarts.  Maybe a big behemoth like Oracle would come across as, ""Oh, now they can't even be bothered to build their own software, and expect a bunch of Open Source experts (since Open Source is where a lot of the expertise in databases currently exists, outside of companies that wouldn't want to help Oracle) to do it for a pittance.""  So, this kind of thing might turn out to be negative publicity for a big company, where it is <i>great</i> publicity for a small company like NetFlix.<p>Just some devil's advocate stuff.  I think you're probably right that there <i>are</i> other areas where this would work.  I don't know that you or I have thought of the best examples of them, though.  Maybe someone reading this thread might have a company for which this model fits perfectly, though.",1245357830

664067,comment,663903,663903,0,0,leecho0,,,"Well, I'm still in school kinda and I'm still in the planning stages of my startup, but I feel that I learned a lot of stuff in college that I really wouldn't have touched otherwise. I dunno how practical it is in the ""real world,"" but I thought my time/ money was worth it.<p>Compilers and languages -- Right now I've got ideas on how to create a new and better programming language (hopefully that will be the 100-year language =P) which will have stuff from lisp, prolog, C++, Java, and first order logic. honestly, there would be no way that I would try to learn lisp by myself, much less understand the elegance of lambda calculus. I wouldn't know where to start thinking about other complex things like knowledge representation and complexity related to it.<p>Linux / vim / eclipse / makefile -- I picked up how to use a lot of tools in college, when some other friends also used it. It would have really bad if I had to learn all of those without being able to call someone up and ask for help.<p>networking -- I've done some stuff outside of school for a year that had nothing to do with CS. I really haven't met so many ""simple"" people before... not that there's anything wrong with that, but I really do not think of them to do interesting projects with. Not all the people I knew from college was a CS major, but I can see myself working with a lot of them for various projects.<p>Machine learning -- This was one of those things that I was interested in, but I can't see myself learning about it all by myself. I took a class about it for audit, then took it again a few years later. It really makes a difference to be pushed to do the work. And even though I forgot about a lot of the details, I don't think it would be too hard to re-learn about random forest, bayesian networks, reinforcement learning, etc.<p>It seems to me that there are a lot of software companies out there that do some stuff that are pretty heavy on the theory side. Google's pagerank, spam filters, antivirus software, etc. I'll bet those kinda jobs are better than a ""4-year-experience-with-java"" job.<p>I'm also not too sure about the ""replacing college with an incubator"" thing... college is something you gotta do, doing a startup is supposed to be a risky thing. I've done a year long senior project that I just totally blew off because it was a ""class project"". People have done much more stuff in three months than what I did that year. If people see the startup incubator as something that's required, i don't think it would work out as well. But I think it would have been helpful if there were more incubators that were closely tied with the school, so that it wouldn't seem like such a far-fetched idea to do a startup.<p>btw, those humanity classes really are a total waste of time.",1245356273

In college you get a mind opening view of what any one subject has to offer, rather than a narrow view driven by a purpose for learning that material. That broad exposure translates to being a more effective thinker and problem solver.<p>And to counter a few more of his points:\n1) The fundamentals don't change every four months.\n2) Lectures can be dry, but it doesn't mean you don't learn from them. And you DO get to put it into practice when you have labs or personal projects (often inspired by the new material you learned).<p>When I read that ""many students"" would do better as entrepreneurs out of high school, I take that as some significant amount of high school graduates.

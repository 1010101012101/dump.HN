473174,comment,472964,472964,0,0,swombat,,,"I used to work in a bank (via a consulting company). My girlfriend works in a bank (she's a salesperson in commodities - she sells future contracts to producers and consumers of metals who want to hedge their production). I have many friends who have worked or are still working in banks.<p>There's not a single one of them that's even indirectly responsible for the economic meltdown. They all work very hard at jobs they don't always enjoy, and provide an extremely valuable and difficult service to their customers. Taking my girlfriend as an example, she often has to juggle multiple phone calls, while checking prices and taking orders, dealing with often irate traders (who would rather swear at the customer than deal with them), all the while being absolutely certain that none of the numbers she writes down are wrong - a small error can result in hundreds of thousands of pounds of losses, and you don't last long in that job if you make errors - <i>any</i> errors.<p>Taking my girlfriend again as an example, she often hates her job, but she does it and does it well for a variety of reason, one of which being that it pays very well. Part of that pay is the bonus. Now, despite the downturn, she's met her budget. She's created millions of pounds of turnover for the bank, because she's good at building strong relationships with her customers over time so they like to trade with her. Does she deserve her bonus? Absolutely.<p>I personally am deeply disturbed by the wave of populist anti-banker sentiment that has captured much of the world. It is wrong, it is base, it is misdirected. There are many people who are responsible for the problems we're having, but your average banker is not one of them. Here's who you should go after:<p>1) Stupid ""homeowners"" (I prefer the term ""homeloaners"", as I don't see that they own anything) who took up loans way beyond their means<p>2) Shark-like loaners (those who chased and made those loans)<p>3) Bond structurers who issued all these CDOs that caused us trouble (as the article points out, less than 1% of bankers)<p>5) Regulatory authorities who didn't do a good enough job of chasing up irregularities and smacking them down<p>4) Dumb lawmakers who passed laws that encouraged the above behaviour by either over-regulating (by forcing banks to lend to bad prospects) or under-regulating (by removing or dulling financial services legislation)<p>The average banker is no more responsible for the mess we're in than the average programmer was responsible for the dot com bust.",1234169728

Arrington was likely the ""victim"" of someone disgusted with his anti-Europe rhetoric (which makes you wonder why he was back there in the first place).  This, on the other hand, could be something far more serious - we will never know.<p>I notice most of the commenters here assuming, based on the description of the attacker, that it must have been some guy who wanted to sneak into the conference, or something of that matter.  As I have a bunch of friends who work in the world of defense contracting, I am lead to a different image in my head; the description closely matches what my friends tell me to watch out for in would-be kidnappers.  You see, there's a real industry in high-end kidnappings/murders/etc., and with our crap economy the incentives just become greater with every passing day.  You will never hear about it in the news, but kidnappings of high profile people and their family members is rapidly increasing.<p>We are at the dawn of a new era of organized crime.

There is no completely satisfactory solution, but concepts like purchasing power parity are not completely meaningless even when different types of goods are consumed.<p>I agree that it gets very vague when societies are as different as ancient Rome and a modern industrial country. But knowing what share of a person's income is spent on biological necessities (basic food and shelter) is meaningful and can be expressed in dollar terms to make it more understandable.",1234169267

Keep all input intact as long as possible, so if you ever do encounter a problem, you don't need to reconstruct the original data. You can always process data into the correct form at runtime.<p>Of course, there are performance implications to this, but those can be dealt with. Encoding strings right away for performance reasons is definitely a premature optimization.",1234168480

473161,comment,471660,471660,0,0,wrinklz,,,"Spoken like a true, ""objective"", small-identity scientist. The problem with that view is that we all do have an identity, and attempting to deny, suppress, or ""put aside"" our identity is fairly impossible. A better path IMHO, is to realize a larger identity. Broadening of the identity is the natural progression from infancy to adult. Quote from Einstein:\n""A human being is a part of a whole, called by us _universe_, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.""",1234168322

473148,comment,472203,472203,0,0,jhancock,,,"The problem with this analogy is that the world of finance does not map directly to physical goods or how a person would handle a real world asset they own (as opposed to abusing other people's assets).<p>Let walk through the first couple of sentences:<p>>> ""John Paulson borrows one cow so he can sell it for $100. He gives you $10 as collateral.""<p>No one in their right mind lets someone walk away with a $100 cow for a $10 deposit.  If you are a car rental company, you don't force the borrower to deposit the full price of the car, but you make up for this risk in volume across many car deposits and you have insurance and the backup of public crime fighting organizations.\nIf you have a single page contract for ""you borrow my cow and give it back later, here's a $10 deposit"" you have none of this.<p>Second is the use of the term ""borrow"".  If I loan you a cow and you return a different cow, this may not be acceptable to the lender. This is not ""borrowing"".<p>>> ""You buy your neighbors cow for $100, which you finance by taking out a $90 loan from the bank and use John's $10 to make up the rest.""<p>ok, full stop!!!  No bank operating correctly will give you a loan against a cow that you have already loaned to someone else.  This is the root of why people use the term ""ponzi scam"" in reference to such transactions.<p>>> ""You brag to everyone about your financial health. You have assets--two cows you own, plus one Paulson owes you--worth $300, and liabilities of just $100.""<p>Sorry, there are still only two cows in this story.  This is not software where you can magically copy a cow.<p>And so goes the problems with analogies like this.<p>Don't get me wrong.  The blog author writes it well and gives a peak at the absurdity of the financial system.\nUnfortunately, the financial system is so absurd that there are no useful metaphor against real world goods.",1234166988

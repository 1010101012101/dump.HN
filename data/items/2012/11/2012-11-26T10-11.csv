4831466,comment,4830058,4831355,2,0,eshvk,,,"> Please don't use such words as hackable when discussing immigration policies, and please try to look at the situation from the perspective of an immigrant.<p>I <i>am</i> an immigrant on a visa, so yeah I do know both sides of the coin. The term ""hackable"" was used from the perspective of how USCIS looks at this.<p>> I have experienced it on me and know what it's like when your wife cannot work, it's fucked up... If you're an american living in US then you will not understand how difficult it can be for the wife and husband. Look at it from another perspective: if family members are allowed to work then they 1. learn the language 2. better integrate into society 3. grow their career 4. become useful for the economy. You should also consider that wife is not husband's property (also true for the reverse case). If she's not allowed to work than she becomes overly dependent on the husband.<p>I am sure you may have had bad experiences and there is no doubt that the situation can be hard. Let me offer a counter perspective: I know several immigrants who come here on H1B visas with their wives on H4 visas. From what I understand, they have two options currently :<p>1. Getting an F1 visa, going to school and then getting a job.<p>2. Getting a company to sponsor the person for an H1B and then switching from H4 to H1B.<p>Both of these situations are hard, no doubt but not impossible. I personally know people who have done them. Yes, they are limited to people who have the money to go to school or the skillset to get a job as an H1B.<p>> I mean com'on I'm so tired of this high-level discussions on immigration, these are people's lives you're talking about. Would you like to lose 5-10 year of your twenties, thirties only to obtain better visa? Would you like to be in the position when you're in a foreign country for multiple years and you cannot break up with your spouse only because of the visa, unless you're willing to go back to your ""home"" country that is not home to you anymore?<p>I personally will somewhere else if I had to wait that long. I refuse to believe that my situation (Or that of any high skilled immigrant who gets paid well and lives a regular middle class life) is worse than the countless undocumented immigrants who get exploited for decades and live under the fear of deportation. I am not trying to create a false dichotomy here but consider this from the perspective of the people who make legislation: Why are highly skilled immigrants supposed to be first in line compared to any one else who comes in?<p>> EDIT: My point is, if you let person into your country don't put additional barriers. If it's a family you're talking about then benchmark all the family members and then decided whether to let them in or not, don't create second class citizens.<p>I don't disagree with you in general. However, my comments were strictly from a policy perspective: The purpose of the H1B is to let people in so that they can temporarily fill a need for highly skilled labor. The rules associated with that visa are what they are.",1353927266

As such the way to improve on the status quo is to lead by example.<p>Looking around me at the 100's of business people that I have contact with the vast majority (much larger than the 60% quoted here) of people with some level of success is in a relationship and a not-so-vast majority (but still substantial) have kids and are living a relatively steady life.<p>For me the young kid that strikes it big is the exception, and as such I am not particularly surprised by this outcome.<p>It would be much more surprising to me if the opposite were the case, your '75% of successful entrepreneurs are single' example would <i>really</i> turn my head because it goes directly against my personal experience.<p>That's not hindsight, it is just reasoning from available data and I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.<p>We should expect to be surprised, but that does not mean that we have to actively twist available data so that we're surprised all the time.<p>Sometimes a result is simply what is to be expected and I firmly believe this is one of those.

If you're an american living in US then you will not understand how difficult it can be for the wife and husband. Look at it from another perspective: if family members are allowed to work then they 1. learn the language 2. better integrate into society 3. grow their career 4. become useful for the economy. You should also consider that wife is not husband's property (also true for the reverse case). If she's not allowed to work than she becomes overly dependent on the husband.<p>I mean com'on I'm so tired of this high-level discussions on immigration, these are people's lives you're talking about. Would you like to lose 5-10 year of your twenties, thirties only to obtain better visa? Would you like to be in the position when you're in a foreign country for multiple years and you cannot break up with your spouse only because of the visa, unless you're willing to go back to your ""home"" country that is not home to you anymore?<p>EDIT: My point is, if you let person into your country don't put additional barriers. If it's a family you're talking about then benchmark all the family members and then decided whether to let them in or not, don't create second class citizens.",1353924408

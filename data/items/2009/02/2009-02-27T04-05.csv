496862,comment,496754,496754,0,0,raffi,,,"I didn't read the article but I'll be honest...  I'm really thankful for my education.  I taught myself programming when I was young and I thought I knew everything when I went to college.  I was thankfully proved wrong.<p>College forced me to learn a lot of stuff I wouldn't have bothered to learn before.  Stuff I had no idea would become useful and if I ever needed it may not have had an idea to look for it.<p>I have an interest in programming languages and interpreters--college helped me find and cultivate this interest.  I'm working on a startup doing a lot of natural language stuff--college gave me the foundation necessary to teach myself the tools of this field quickly.<p>The theoretical underpinnings of stuff don't go away.  Understanding different string matching algorithms can apply to writing an efficient style checker, not just making an asinine version of strcmp.<p>Granted this is all oriented towards technical stuff.  I suppose if I wanted to be just an entrepreneur I could save money and buy a Subway franchise.  I don't think a college education is necessary there either (but I'm sure it doesn't hurt).",1235710631

If you just measure by time spent, you're maybe coming out of college 5-20% of the way down the path.<p>But I'd argue that the computer science degree isn't specific enough to count nearly that much.

I had all this info and a whole elevator pitch ready to give the Valve crew when they sat down to play our game.<p>They stopped me from giving any info, tips or advice. The way they test games is to watch people play them with out any prep. Just shut your mouth, stand behind them and write down anything that they have trouble with or generally fumble around with. Any part of the game which they couldn&#x27;t intuitively grasp needed to be reworked.<p>It was definitely one of the most difficult things I&#x27;ve ever had to do. It was truly painful to watch people, my heroes no less, completely fail to work out wtf they were meant to be doing and not explain it.<p>However it was by far the most productive test session in the 3 years we&#x27;d been working on the game. It completely showed our &quot;baby&quot; in a different light and we instantly knew we had a heap of work to do.",1401825567

7842356,comment,7835566,7838420,4,0,dredmorbius,,,"I think the disruption will emerge out of new replacement tools, probably emerging from some of the existing systems, though not from the current major players in browser space (Firefox, Gnome, Safari, IE), which I&#x27;m increasingly seeing as dead ends.  This is reflected both in history and in the present situation.<p>In the past, revolutions in browser models didn&#x27;t happen through evolution of existing browsers so much as their <i>wholesale replacement</i>.<p>The Web itself supplanted a whole set of proprietary document formats, both static and hypertext, of which Tim O&#x27;Reilly has written and spoken about this in talking about the origins of O&#x27;Reilly & Associates.  His <i>Open Sources</i> essay covers this tangentially, though I think there are better examples I&#x27;m not finding at present:\n<a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/tim.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/tim.html</a><p><i>In this regard, it&#x27;s interesting to point out that the software industry&#x27;s first attempts to improve on the web interface for active content--technologies like browser-side Java applets and Microsoft ActiveX controls--failed because they were aimed at professional programmers and could not easily be copied and implemented by the amateurs who were building the Web. Vendors viewed the Web in software terms, and didn&#x27;t understand that the Web was changing not only what applications were being built but what tools their builders needed.</i><p>The upshot:  HTML wasn&#x27;t pay-to-play, you weren&#x27;t locked within a proprietary &quot;ecosystem&quot;.  It also wasn&#x27;t subject to the format limitations of postscript and PDF.  It&#x27;s even been backwards-bolted onto existing information infrastructures such as manpages and GNU Info documents via tools such as Debian&#x27;s dwww:<p><a href=""https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/dwww"" rel=""nofollow"">https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/dwww</a><p>And so proprietary doc formats gave way to HTML.  Lynx begat Mosaic, which added graphics, then Netscape, which extended graphics and a number of other capabilities, until it fell over under its own bloated mass of bugs and technical debt and birthed Mozilla.<p>Tabbed browsing came by way of ... um, whatever it was that graced HN a week or so back, in 1997/98, though didn&#x27;t reach high visibility until around 2000 by way of Opera, Skipstone, and Galeon, from which it was rapidly adopted by Mozilla, which itself grew emphasizing Xul (remember that) until <i>it</i> collapsed and was replaced by a user&#x27;s one-off, Firefox.  Google got into the game with Chrome which seems headed in the apps engine direction (and from which I suspect it will similarly collapse as a Web browser).<p>For the lightweight document reading <i>and</i> management interface, I suspect we&#x27;ll see emergence from some of the existing eBook reader / bibliography / online simplification tools.  I suspect that sites will start publishing in a simplified format (ePub, Markdown, LaTeX, DocBook, possibly even strict HTML5), which can be rendered <i>to client preferences</i> and in a device- and format-independent manner.  Our problem isn&#x27;t a want of semantic markups, it&#x27;s running QC over the ones we&#x27;ve got and ensuring people are using them properly.  Absent some sort of publishing authority (think along the lines of Debian&#x27;s package management system) I don&#x27;t know how this could be enforced.  Perhaps adding smarts at the webserver level:  &quot;Hey, that document you just loaded, those tags you use, I do not think they mean what you think they mean.&quot;  A validation step integrated as part of the publishing process.<p>Or maybe a nudge from search engines (though Google&#x27;s own craptacular markup in its G+ pages makes me suspect this is wishful thinking).  A well-formed, semantically-correct page gets a higher SERP ranking than one that&#x27;s a clusterfuck.  And hey, the SEOs will love me because this gives them yet another contracting/consulting service opportunity.  Sigh.<p>Candidates to grow into this niche on the client side include Calibre, Zotero, Moon+Reader (and other ePub readers), and perhaps some of the generalized reader tools such as Evince and Okular (the GNOME and KDE readers).  I&#x27;d like to explore the Internet Archive&#x27;s BookReader as a _local_ client (it&#x27;s presently oriented at Web content) -- ironically it&#x27;s actually got <i>vastly</i> better presentation performance than most <i>local</i> readers I&#x27;ve seen.  I expect dedicated PDF readers to go the way of the dodo.  Pandoc is another tool to keep you eye on.  I&#x27;ve played with that recently, with some script glue, to convert an ePub to LaTeX source and then PDF output (still somewhat preferred for local viewing, ePubs still annoy me on Linux desktop).  <i>Nothing</i> makes me happy at present, but I&#x27;m seeing some glimmers of light.<p>The apps platform space:  some sort of sandbox in which remote apps can play but only in a limited sense.  Effectively creating a mobile device environment within the desktop (on mobile, the apps already have their space).  Key elements of this will be standardizing on widget sets, state preservation (apps should be immune to having the rug pulled out from under them), and <i>user-controlled</i> privacy controls (lacking in present app and browser models).  A data liberation standard would also be very useful, so long as I&#x27;m compiling my ideal wishlist.  I&#x27;ve got less experience here than elsewhere, and I&#x27;m probably missing a lot.<p>Seeing apps which are <i>functionally</i> oriented rather than <i>site</i> oriented would be a huge plus.  The &quot;download our app&quot; annoyance must die yesterday.<p>On the commercial space, we&#x27;re already seeing proprietary dedicated ecommerce platforms -- that&#x27;s what the mobile shopping apps from Apple (iTunes), Google (Play Store), and Amazon (Amazon Marketplace) are, effectively.  Each is, of course, a silo.  The next step is going to be for someone to come up with a <i>generalized</i> shopping interface which can access any of the back-ends.  Google&#x27;s doing some interesting work here with its Google Shopping Express, and the <i>really</i> interesting element of this would be, IMO, to integrate a few different areas of shopping:<p>• Information gathering.  Essentially, reviews of both merchants and products.  A cross between Yelp, Google Reviews, Wikipedia, and Amazon&#x27;s reviews.<p>• Merchant info.  Often I simply want to go to a physical location and get standard information (hours, available merchandise, service availability for, say, a barbarshop or restaurant or auto shop).<p>• Stock info.  Is X product in stock?  This is actually where I think the most interesting aspects may happen, as it could see a tie-in of merchant systems with the rest of the supply chain.  As with what I&#x27;ve discussed recently on disintermediating of search, providing local merchants the access to global supply-chain and inventory management which is presently only available to big box stores could be a huge disruptor.  It&#x27;s not an easy problem to solve, but it could be immensely profitable.  There&#x27;s actually a name for this, &quot;Federated Retail&quot;:  <a href=""http://instagov.com/wiki/Federated_retail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagov.com/wiki/Federated_retail</a><p>• Ordering.  Requesting a specific item.<p>• Payment.  <i>Note that ordering and payment are separate.</i>  I may well want to <i>order</i> online but pay in person.<p>• Fulfillment / shipping / delivery / pickup.  The act of actually getting the thing you want.  Note that while delivery to the home <i>may</i> be convenient, it often <i>isn&#x27;t</i>, and one really useful function a merchant can provide is for warehousing of orders.  I actually <i>do</i> special-order products frequently <i>from local merchants</i> (bookstores, hardware stores, clothing stores), especially <i>where seeing, handling, getting fitted, or browsing products</i> is a significant part of the experience.  So long as the pick-up location is convenient to my daily habits, walking a few blocks really isn&#x27;t a big deal.  And it&#x27;s often <i>far</i> more convenient <i>than arranging to be at home at a specific time.</i>  At least until such time as homes and residences are constructed with package delivery as a consideration.<p>• Authentication <i>if necessary</i>.  Note that often this <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a requirement, and, frankly, authenticated deep behavior tracking is a massive turn-off for me on virtually any online shopping experience, <i>and is among the key reasons I avoid online shopping where possible.</i>  I&#x27;m one of those reverse show-roomers:  I&#x27;ll often research a product on Amazon, then buy it locally.<p>One of the things I find most interesting about online shopping isn&#x27;t its size or growth, but the <i>lack</i> of these.  For the past several years, online retail has been <i>underperforming</i> growth estimates:  <a href=""http://redd.it/243in1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/243in1</a><p>In 2010, TechCrunch cited Forrester Research predicting 8% of all retail sales by 2014.<p>From the US Small Business Administration we have &quot;An Analysis of Internet Sales Taxation and the Small Seller Exemption[5] &quot; giving surprisingly low numbers in November, 2013:  &quot;According to the U.S. Census Bureau, online sales accounted for approximately 5.3 percent of total retail sales in the second quarter of 2013. While online sales still represent a small share of total sales, they are expected to grow significantly in the future.&quot;<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/08/forrester-forecast-online-retail-sales-will-grow-to-250-billion-by-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/08/forrester-forecast-online-r...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sba.gov/advocacy/7540/758295"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sba.gov/advocacy/7540/758295</a><p>For media, as noted, there are a number of existing tools which provide a superior playback experience to browser-embedded players.  My main complaint with, e.g., VLC, is that it&#x27;s unstable (tends to crash), loses playlists, and if playing, say, YouTube content, seems to establish a link to the present instance of the content URL which changes, so that if you&#x27;re playing with interruptions, you&#x27;ll lose the source and have to re-queue the original YouTube link to your playlist, which is a bit of a PITA.",1401825281

I kept having to increase the server instance size as the team cargo-culted more and more gems into the Gemfile and the multiple Rails executables run under Unicorn continued to grow in size and eventually run out of memory on the server.\nI agree that my example using OpenStruct only moves the conditional but in this case it moves it out of a place where I find conditional logic much harder to reason about. Also, if there were more attributes than just name that come out of that object you could potentially be eliminating many more conditionals with just the one in current_user which also seems like a win.",1401824984

Handling means almost always a some sort of logging function or user notification, not actually doing something about it. It&#x27;s easy to forget it&#x27;s not only about resource management.

I don&#x27;t think having a healthy skepticism in all things precludes having strong opinions about what&#x27;s wrong with the world, in fact I agree with much of the basis of what you&#x27;re saying. Heck, just a few months ago I walked away from several thousand dollars that I could&#x27;ve had just for letting someone put my name on a software patent. It would&#x27;ve been nothing to me to do that, but I know I would&#x27;ve felt dirty because of my views on software patents.<p>If all you want to do is preach to the choir, fine, but if you care about making a difference in the world by changing the minds of people who either don&#x27;t know about these things or are on the fence about it, then your choice of words is going to drive away fence sitters and possibly discredit others who are on your side.<p>This is exactly what RMS does, and it hasn&#x27;t exactly worked well for him. Look at the phrases you use: &quot;imaginary property&quot;, &quot;attacking justice&quot;, &quot;destroying the future&quot;. Those are strong words with loaded meaning- just using phrases like that is a rhetorical trick that most people are going to see through immediately. Those kinds of words should be reserved for things which are facepalmingly obvious; simple binary issues which have no gray areas, and are not things on which reasonable people can disagree in any respect. The fact that you present it in such a way is going to be interpreted by the audience in one of two ways:<p>(1) You really believe that all (or almost all) IP law the world over is really one of those blindingly obvious binary issues relating to basic morality that has few or no gray areas, to the degree that you don&#x27;t care about changing anyone&#x27;s mind; in fact, you would like to shame anyone who disagrees with you or is on the fence about any aspect it. You put it up there with pedophilia and ethnic cleansing and all the other things for which there is pretty much absolute consensus on in most of the developed world.<p>- or -<p>(2) You know how complicated it all is, and the history and rationale for it and so on, but you think that the people you&#x27;re talking to are lesser minds who are only going to be swayed by hyperbolic, emotional language and loaded terminology.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s not constructive, and may actually be destructive to the cause (again, see RMS/PETA/Earth First/etc.). I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re coming from- I think you mean well and are probably young and very passionate about this stuff, and for the most part I think you&#x27;re on the right side and hopefully on the side of history. I just remember spending years with much the same mindset, without even realizing it, and it didn&#x27;t help anyone. Another danger of using bile and invective and loaded terminology as a form of argumentation is that after a while you might start believing it yourself, in which case (1) and/or (2) become not just what you&#x27;re mistakenly communicating but what you actually believe. And that is the path to the Dark Side. :(",1401823772

It would also be unwise to buy a house with HOA covenant restrictions, as you may find that the lawn and landscaping of atheists are held to higher standards than those of households attending the same church as the HOA president.<p>Small and petty-minded people are everywhere on this planet.  They will go as far as everyone else allows them to go.  And wherever they are the majority, all others beware.<p>So some places, they just kill you.  Other places, they make you want to kill yourself.  Either way, you are surrounded by people that have no respect for individuality.  In that sense, it is as bad, but obviously, being murdered arbitrarily is worse than not ever being invited to the neighborhood barbecue.<p>Either way, you have to either hide your true nature or move somewhere less hostile.",1401822134

Despite various claims made, we want to get the best performance we can!<p>We will confirm support for AMD&#x27;s fglrx driver when they have shipped a non-beta release that allows the game to run correctly, though it does seem that the 14.4 rev2 driver largely addresses this. On my personal machine with a Radeon HD 7750, I get an ASIC hang with this driver after playing for roughly half an hour - so I am currently hesitant to &quot;officially recommend&quot; it.<p>On my machine, using PlayOnLinux, Witcher 2 performance is worse than our port is. However, with the CSMT patch, it does appear to be much better. We are looking into why this is, and suspect that the issue comes down to poor multithreading in GL currently, which is exactly what CSMT avoids by making all GL operations occur on a single thread.<p>Witcher 2 is making use of multi threaded Direct3D 9 support, and we are implementing this in eON by using shared GL contexts, one for each thread. The context share resources such as textures and vertex buffers. We are investigating whether this turns out to be a big performance hit or not.</i>",1401822112

One company was focused on web apps, the other on native apps, but they both benefited from having a cross-platform renderer. With the big contributors pulling in different directions sometimes, WebKit tended to settle on a happy middle.<p>Hopefully there&#x27;s a silver lining to the Blink fork: more differentiated renderers in the wild means that web developers will have to rely more on standards again, instead of going nuts with &quot;-webkit&quot; prefixes and Chrome-only apps.",1401822043

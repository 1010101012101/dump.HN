The only exception was one term where an illness and a death in the family had me learning my first term organic chemistry up through the night before (which I then aced :-).<p>If you enter this last day before the exam confident that you've mastered the material as much as possible doing this should work, perhaps you might view your ability to do so as more of a test of your lack of anxiety or whatever.  If you can pull it off it should leave you mentally refreshed and ready to do your best on Der Tag.",1273316237

I'd have to wonder if Google Finance is even in the same business, e.g. unlike the WSJ or FT it doesn't charge ""subscribers"" for regular content at all.<p>The WSJ has some free articles and lots more if it thinks the link is redirected through Google (perhaps the Pro Edition articles don't allow that???), the FT only allows you to read 3 articles per month without free registration, then at allows a bit more than a dozen per month the last time I checked.<p>One thing to look for is non-delayed market info, you have to pay a lot more to get it without a 15 minute or whatever delay.",1273315640

What can you recommend to prepare myself mentally?<p>I've been looking into some mental preparation for athletes but I haven't come across onto something ""trainable"" (like doing something everyday for 15min.). What I picked up during reading Michael Jordans ""Driven from Within'"" is that Michael Jordan was never scared before a match because he knew he was prepared (trained x amount of hours for a match, etc.) so well. Maybe, I will be in this shape at the end of the preparation time, but maybe I won't that's why I'd like to train my mental coolness.<p>Thanks for your help.",1273314466

(There are other factors, of course, like declining birth rates and improving health care, but pension funds would be in better shape overall if more people were heavy smokers.)",1273313945

The only certainty is that by smoking you are almost insured of it - supposing a stroke or aneurysm doesn't take you out.<p>I'm honestly not trolling, I've always felt it curious when people tell me that smoking results in a painful death, leaving me wondering how they think they are going to be going out of this world.  Natural causes?  Not likely.",1273313759

When webmail came, it's natural that they followed this practice.<p>Facebook is a closed system. When you send a message to someone on Facebook, you presume that you are adding that message within Facebook. The notification email that Facebook sends to the recipient is just that, a notification generated by the Facebook system. You, the sender of the message is not part of this notification system, though you your action triggered the notification. There is no reason why the sender's IP should be exposed in this flow under normal circumstances.",1273313727

I suppose it might be awkward if it were 8 smokers plus me as the only non-smoker, but I've mostly worked in offices with very few smokers, who might otherwise be standing outside smoking by themselves, so I ask if I can join them, if it's someone I at least sort of know already.<p>It does add slightly more social awkwardness, since I sort of have to explain why I would want to join them on a smoke break if I don't smoke, but I actually do genuinely enjoy getting out of my chair and going outside for a few minutes, and maybe swinging by the coffee cart on the way back, and it seems to have worked out well with at least a few coworkers I've had.",1273313450

A constant comment was the astonishment at how much more productive the French were per hour in their office environment.  They were coming from US workplaces where the norm was to have a big commute, work an hour or more a day of unpaid overtime, to one where the sub-40 hour work week was rigidly enforced.  The main thing that went away was zoned-out office workers spending their days talking about TV and office gossip.  (YMMV, of course).",1398735759

7664379,comment,7662957,7664093,8,0,orionblastar,,,"Thanks for the hugs.<p>I learned over 37 different programming languages on many different operating systems over the years. Some might be old and outdated but thanks to open source projects they got compilers for modern systems. So I can do COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, Turbo C, Ada, and a lot of other misc languages that the current graduates and drop-outs don&#x27;t even know. I can do legacy programming for that and convert code from one language to another. I can even do that with SQL databases and convert flat files and DBF files to SQL databases.<p>Many of my jobs for which I got paid $150K/year was upscaling a database from Excel, Access, etc formats to MS-SQL server and turning VBA code into Visual BASIC code. I used to write the program that would read the file, and then sync it up with SQL Server and then modify the Visual BASIC code to pull the data from SQL Server.<p>Yeah I know I got laughed at for using Visual BASIC, but it paid very well. I used quicksort and heapsort algorithms to speed up the code that coworkers write that was just too slow. It went from 15 minutes to generate a report to just 15 seconds. Most problems in Visual BASIC is due to the programer using a slow algorithm and if you know how to rewrite it, then it runs faster. most Visual BASIC programmers use the bubble sort, don&#x27;t know why it is called a bubble sort or why it is so slow.<p>I do security and quality checks, read some stuff by Schnermann and Deming. I almost always write a function named SQLFilter that filters out control codes and SQL codes to prevent SQL injection attacks in order to sanitize inputs. I also write one named HTMLfilter that filters out HTML codes, because you don&#x27;t want someone to exploit you by adding in HTML tags that do something nasty. Ask Pesico about that Name your own Dew contest and they didn&#x27;t filter out HTML tags and how &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot; won the contest due to some hackers and trolls on 4Chan and Reddit. Well if they used my HTMLFilter function, that would not have happened. I see spammers exploit Facebook using HTML codes and Javascript to automatically like posts and tag friends in a new post with an embedded video. If only they sanitized out HTML codes and rejected Javascript in the forms, spammers could not even do that.<p>Well maybe now you see how important what I do really is, most if not all of the 90% of startups that fail, don&#x27;t do quality checks and security checks, because it &#x27;takes too long&#x27; and they are in a hurry to get that code released so they can get a paycheck and start up that IPO.<p>I am a super debugger, you see, I fix the mistakes the rookies make. Most high school and college dropouts are rookies who make these rookie mistakes. I debug those mistakes and correct them.<p>Right now I am learning Haskell, I got my own GNU/Linux distro but I also use Lubuntu. I also know C++, Java, Python, PHP, C# and feel like given enough time I could learn any language and find ways to translate code from one language to another.

Android app developers know more about their success rate. It&#x27;s from a pre-scientific age, where something that seems philosophically correct (a defense lawyer and a jury of your peers, an independent judge, dehydrating and bleeding sick people, the function of the pineal gland) is assumed to obtain correct outcomes. QED.<p>What is shocking is that the public, especially the great many who have interacted with the law enforcement system, continues to have faith in it. As long there is no political pressure from the public, the judiciary won&#x27;t change.<p>Off the top of my head, two methods might better measure accuracy:<p>METHOD A<p>1) Take a random sample of prisoners<p>2) Re-examine the evidence in their cases in a highly rigorous way (the judicial system does not do this unless the defendant can afford it).<p>3) Most cases will be inconclusive (I think). From the conclusive cases, you can infer something about the accuracy of the judicial &quot;method&quot;<p>METHOD B<p>1) Identify kinds of evidence that meets scientific levels of accuracy, such as DNA<p>2) Start with the population in jail for which that evidence is available. Because most cases are settled by plea bargains, I expect it will be most cases.<p>3) Again, most cases will be inconclusive (I think).

Therefore, the claims of a sexist environment don&#x27;t hold&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with very few outright sexists/racists/whatever-ists in tech (and judging by this discussion, they definitely exist, they&#x27;re loud, but the vast majority of us have a consensus as to what we think of them). But I&#x27;ve worked with a large number of people (and occasionally/regretfully have ventured into this group myself) who can be described as &quot;equal opportunity jackasses&quot;.<p>The reality is this - the damage of being an &quot;equal opportunity asshole&quot; is felt more strongly by marginalized groups. When a white male is mistreated by $jackass, the thought process goes like: &quot;$jackass is being a jackass to me.&quot;. When a member of $marginalized_group is mistreated by said jackass, the thought process is: &quot;$jackass is being a jackass to me.

Not just because it creates a more inclusive environment, but because it creates one that&#x27;s a whole lot healthier for all of us.

I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single one of us here who isn&#x27;t guilty of this at some point - and I don&#x27;t think any of us can promise never to be a jackass in the future.

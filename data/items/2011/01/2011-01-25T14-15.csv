Rather than home recording producing unreleasable cassette demos, they're now often good enough to upload to YouTube or sell directly to fans. As a result, the people who've paid for professional studio time now have to compete directly with all those home recordings, whereas previously they could more or less ignore them. That drives down prices.<p>Related, many artists actually put a negative value on their time: there are quite a few people who love what they do so much that they're actually willing to subsidize their own art-production by working other jobs (e.g. waiting tables).",1295967015

Okay.  Now, where's the <i>teaching</i>?  Here are three cases of lack of teaching:  (1) At least since 1929, we should have understood how a financial bubble that bursts and makes a large fraction of the banking sector broke can wreck an economy.<p>(2) In particular, for the housing bubble, we should have had the teaching at least since Clinton's term.  Uh, as I understand it, Clinton and Bush 43 both saw the dangers of having Fannie and Freddie guarantee liar, junk, sub-prime mortgages but (A) didn't see anything to do about it that was practical politically and (B) just hoped we would get by somehow anyway.  Uh, to be more clear, it was the lack of <i>teaching</i> that made the solution not practical politically.<p>(3) As the housing bubble was developing, we should have had some real details on what the heck was going on.  We didn't.  Indeed, we still don't want to talk about the <i>politically incorrect</i> details and want to blame <i>Wall Street</i> instead of the Congressional Black Caucus and Barney Frank and what they told Fannie and Freddie, the Community Reinvestment Act, and how some of the <i>adjustable rate</i> loan writers <i>gamed</i> the system.  Wall Street and even the bond rating agencies, as bad as they were, were really only the tail of that sick dog.<p>So, US irresponsible nonsense shot the world economy in the knees.  The Asian banking crisis was another example.  And 1929 was another example, with severe <i>consequences</i> through 1945 and continuing consequences through the Cold War.  Are we learning yet?  For the US 1929 bubble, I chalk up about 100 million people killed in WWII; so I'm for more <i>teaching</i>.  Yes, we've needed a lot of <i>teaching</i> right along.<p>But for this needed <i>teaching</i>, in the national media and in particular in the NYT and in the Krugman columns there we get nothing significant.  We get much more on Lady Gaga than anything at all serious on the economy, and the economy is a very serious subject.<p>So, Professor, to start we were talking about, uh, what was it now, oh, I remember, <i>the economy</i>.  Okay, what's that?  I mean, can we have a description, please?  So, we should get the relevant data and present it usually in graphs and where each graph addresses one or several relevant questions about, say, standard of living, unemployment, government deficits, our <i>intellectual capital</i> (from education, research, and development), foreign trade, GDP, taxes as a fraction of GDP, where the taxes are coming from, government spending as a fraction of GDP, where the spending is going, and these quantities over time with percentage changes.  We need to know where the money is and what the flows are.  Similarly we need to know a description of US and world economic activity and flows, e.g., in the sense of Leontief.  That's for a start in any <i>teaching</i> about the economy.  At least such data would give us a basis for discussions about the Federal deficit.  Of course, to get early warning about housing bubbles, etc., we need much more detail than that.<p>So, where is this data?  Professor, I see next to nothing in your columns, the NYT, or the US media.<p>Uh, Professor, since you are a professor of economics, you actually do have the data, don't you?  And you have some good analysis of the data?  So, for <i>teaching</i>, think you will let us see the data and the analyses too?<p>Professor, on the US economy, the US is flying blind.  The situation is grotesque, outrageously irresponsible, and apparently little better among economists than the <i>newsies</i> and the public.<p>For one example, let's have a little <i>reality check</i>:<p>We might consider the campaign, I mean the 2008 campaign for president -- you remember, that, right?  So, now the president wants to talk about jobs, the economy, and <i>competitiveness</i>, right?<p>In the campaign, we remember the interview of Obama by the San Francisco Chronicle on 1/17/2008.  The video has been on YouTUBE at two URLs, but both are now dead.  Some of the more important audio is now at<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdi4onAQBWQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdi4onAQBWQ</a><p>So, here Obama deliberately intends to use carbon taxes to ""bankrupt"" US coal fired electric generating plants, that is, about half of our electric generating capacity.<p>Then he wants to replace that capacity with his favorite <i>100% all-natural, pure, pristine, precious, green, clean, renewable</i> energy from whatever and especially from wind turbines and solar cells and associated equipment sold by his good buddy GE CEO Immelt.<p>And, of course the <i>reason</i> to destroy half of our capacity is to <i>save the planet from the hideous scourge of global warming caused by CO2 from evil humans</i>, oops, not ""global warming"" but now, may I have the memo, please, ""climate change"".  Right:  Now the problem is ""climate change"" as if we were going to keep the climate from changing.  Looks like a permanent job.<p>Yup, it's a really good <i>morality play</i>:  Human <i>sin</i> results in human <i>transgressions</i> against an angry, vengeful god that inflicts <i>retribution</i> from which humans need <i>redemption</i> via sacrifice.<p>Uh, recall, Padawan learners, that the trilogy of transgression, retribution, and redemption is an old formula fiction <i>framework</i> with leading examples in Wagner's <i>Ring</i>, Tolkien's <i>Ring</i>, and Lucas's <i>Star Wars</i>.<p>Such a morality play and trilogy are very old flim-flam, fraud, scams inflicted on easily manipulated, fearful, ignorant, superstitious masses and a favorite of various charlatans, witch doctors, religious leaders, etc. for hundreds of years including the Mayans who killed people to pour their blood on a rock to <i>keep the sun moving across the sky</i>, <i>The Music Man</i> who wanted to use a ""pool table in town"" to raise the specter of ""sin and corruption"" and sell band instruments and uniforms and catch the next train out of town, up to Saint Laureate Al Guru, Immelt, and Obama.<p>So, raise the cost of electric power at the plant from about 3 cents per KWh to, drawing from experience in Germany and Spain, about 50 cents.<p>So, shoot the US economy in the gut just to see it bleed.  Some contribution to ""US competitiveness"".<p>The guy wants to destroy half of our electric generating capacity; that would do us more damage than any foreign enemy has yet accomplished.<p>Thus endth one reality check.<p>But our highly self-esteemed professor continued with:<p>""a much-needed increase in public investment"" apparently on ""on infrastructure and education"".<p>For ""infrastructure"", here in NY one of the Obama proposals is a high speed train from Manhattan to Albany.  Hmm ....  Last time I got a car registration, I had to pay a big surcharge to support the money losing trains from the NYC suburbs into Manhattan.  So, those trains don't make money.  Amtrak loses money.  For getting from Manhattan to Albany, now a good way is via car mostly up the Taconic State Parkway, and I can assure the erudite one that for the last half of the trip there is nearly no traffic.  Net, such a train would just lose money.  All or nearly all the passenger trains in the US lose money.<p>Uh, we had passenger trains:  E.g., can go to NE Indiana, to Fort Wayne, 30 miles west to Warsaw, 15 miles south to Claypool, a crossroads with two churches, one school, a cemetery, a trailer park, and a few retail stores.  And there are railroad tracks and an old train station.  At one time, could catch a passenger train there and get to essentially any big city in the US and from the back to nearly any such crossroads in the US.  But the Model T Ford did a lot to kill the passenger trains, and by 1960 they were nearly all gone.  There's no chance that passenger trains will have success against current cars, roads, and airplanes.  Apparently passenger trains are where you and Obama are saying ""Yes we can"".  Sorry:  No you can't.  In the US, passenger trains lose big money.<p>Uh, Professor, just what is it about losing money you find so attractive?<p>For ""education"", just what is it you would like to teach?  The US is awash in educational institutions, and now a big concern is that students should not get loans for such education because the return on investment is too low and much a student's financial strength for life can be ruined trying to pay back the loans.  Uh, Professor, in NYS, an electrician's license is a better foundation for a career that will permit buying a house and supporting a family than a Ph.D. in electrical engineering or, for that matter, most Ph.D. degrees.<p>Or you want students to take out loans to have you teach students economics to help them avoid the pitfalls of the real US economy that you avoided by being a professor of economics supported by student loans, gifts from wealthy alumni, and research grants from the US Federal government from taxes extracted from people who actually do productive work for a living?<p>No sale.<p>Net, Professor, I would make two points, both well supported by history:<p>First, a real economy is important, often gets sick, and then ruins many lives and kills lots of people.<p>Second, the academic economic profession studies essentially only imaginary economies, there usually using irrelevant mathematics (e.g., the Kuhn-Tucker conditions), and knows next to nothing about any real economy.  E.g., you are missing the first step -- good descriptive data.<p>So, I conclude:  Sorry, Professor Krugman, you are more of the problem than the solution.",1295966652

If so, I could see a short term where getting a job might be difficult, until enough companies get burned and realized they should have never let their information off their network.<p>Back in the late 90's I had a choice. I could go be a programmer or I could go be a sysadmin. I really love programming. I in fact spend my ""free time"" (as much as a father of an infant and toddler has) programming. However at that time I noticed all the noise about how all the programming jobs were being outsourced.<p>I made the conclusion then that they could outsource the programmer, but they still need someone to run the infrastructure. I think that will always be the case. I've worked for business focused, rather than technology focused, companies my entire career. OK, 13 years in I've only worked for 2 companies so I can't say I have a ton of exposure, but still... My experience is that the business user wants things done a certain way and a lot of my time is spent engineering solutions to meet those requirements, which often change several times during the project phase. Cloud solutions currently are a pretty well defined box, one that I don't see a lot of business users being comfortable with the restrictions offered.<p>I do see some things going to cloud. Email for example... please take it. I could get more work done not having to do restores because someone decided to make a POP connection to their mailbox with their phone and deleted all their email on the server. However most of the other solutions I'd see going to the cloud are going to have to go onto basically virtual servers like what Rackspace and Amazon EC2 instances offer. And who's going to know how to manage, configure, and keep those security updates going? Oh yea, the guys who've done it on physical infrastructure for the past few decades.  So basically if a company goes that way then I'll have less warranty replacements to worry about.<p>I think perhaps the cloud is going to change the nature of a sysadmin's job, but the profession isn't going to go away. Heck, I don't even know that I've ever been a pure sysadmin. Seems I've always had to do some programming, engineering and dabble in network the whole time I've been doing this job.<p>Lastly, I support my company. When there's an emergency, I am available to handle it. I'm not busy managing several other companies disasters as the same time. My business can also dictate my downtime. Oh, you're having a conference in New Zealand during the time we have our normally scheduled email maintenance, well let me just move that window for you so you can get your job done.

</code></pre>
My reply to that basically covers your comment, so I thought I'd include it here (with minor editing):<p><pre><code>    It's clear that you think this sort of email is cute
    and fun. Possibly I used to think so too, 30 years
    ago. Now, however, I've seen too many of them, read
    too many of them, felt cheated of time by too many of
    them.

    I don't hate fun. I love having fun. I seek out having
    fun. I make time to have fun. What's not fun, pretty
    much by definition, is someone else's attempt at humor
    that is not, to me, funny.

    If it had been me receiving that email I'd've resented
    the 30 seconds it took to check that its content was
    ""CD posted"", and that everything else was there purely
    for entertainment. I didn't find it entertaining. My
    tastes have changed over the years.

    So, in short, I love fun, have lots of fun, and think
    lots of things are funny. That wasn't one of them.</code></pre>",1295965358

So, I have always understood the movie in light of the book. And yet, I love Kubrick's films -- he's my favorite director, and I think I would have loved 2001 even without having read the book. In that case, I think my interpretation would have been a lot like Ebert's, although I wouldn't have been able to express it as well.

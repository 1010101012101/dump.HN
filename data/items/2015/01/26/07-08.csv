8945963,comment,8940411,8945703,0,0,woodman,,,"> The reductionistic part is in the very belief that there&#x27;s such a thing as a &quot;finest component of information&quot; in the first place.<p>That seems like a major leap.  I&#x27;ve heard people propose that there are limits to human understanding due to complexity, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard the suggestion that there is some level of information beyond any possible measurement.  The lowest level I can think of is existence vs nonexistence - and you are essentially suggesting that there is some other state beyond measurement and therefor reasoning.  Of course, such a thing would be impossible to prove... so the scientific method would be of no use.  So if what you are suggesting is true, then it would have no influence on what I&#x27;m proposing anyway.  Wait... you aren&#x27;t religious are you?  I&#x27;m not trying to pry or be insulting, but this suggestion would only really make sense in the context of trying to establish a place for religion in science.<p>As far as the rest, formal logic exists to do exactly what you say can&#x27;t be done.  Your argument sounds more like an appeal to emotion than anything else.",1422259085

It gets programmers/developers riled up - because it&#x27;s so believable.<p>It is indeed the case that the characters are vastly different in terms of skill, and that is sort of the point. Alan did spend time developing his skills, but it was focused on frameworks and processes, and not effective programming or problem solving. Maybe he just didn&#x27;t have the right start, didn&#x27;t know what he didn&#x27;t know, and just went the wrong way from there. But management, and Alan himself, can&#x27;t tell the difference.<p>I think that&#x27;s the ultimate take-away. Non-programmers and &quot;bad&quot; programmers can&#x27;t recognize good programming, even if they look at results. Well they can, but it takes a lot of time and luck to come across comparable situations. It seems like an intractable problem. They don&#x27;t know who to trust; and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to find out for them, except to be genuinely good at developing software... but how to know which way to go about that?",1422258941

Programming is a <i>social</i> activity, even if you never ever meet another developer in person -- coding is communication -- it is communicating the the authors of libraries and tools using the APIs and interfaces that they have created ...while also creating your own &#x27;story/conversation/...can&#x27;t find the word for it&#x27;<p>To repeat the Hal Abelson quote in the context of what I am saying:<p><pre><code>  > Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.\n</code></pre>\nUnlike sushi making, programmers collaborate. They build on top of each others work. So in this context, another skill that&#x27;s extermely important to cultivate as a programmer is the ability to communicate intent both via code (ie: modularity, good stucture, good variable names ...etC) and otherwise (documentation, following standards so that you don&#x27;t surprise your &#x27;users&#x27; -- who could also mean other developers, ..etc) are important as well.<p>So, on a higher level than specific skill, I&#x27;d urge you to stop thinking of programming as a sole activity that you indulge in. A lot of good programming advice (like the quote above or the robustness principle[1] or &#x27;There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.&#x27;) when seen in the light of a &#x27;more-than-one-person&#x27; activity suddenlly make a whole lot of more good sense.<p>Ok, I think the point is made. :-)<p>[1] Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others \n    <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle</a>",1422258860

8945901,comment,8945701,8945701,0,0,jimminy,,,"The first step is defining the goals/requirements of being a programmer. The generality of such a question makes any answer hard, and likely cause one to stray from the core. I will try to keep what follows pure as possible, and disregard specific skills required for web development vs. low-level systems vs application development, etc.<p>Having watched Jiro Dreams Of Sushi, his task is to provide excellence in food, in service, and overall experience. And at the root he needs to understand each component of the food and the service intimately, so that he can put them together in a way that is both pleasurable and fitting to the customer. He uses what he knows and the resources he has to create the best dishes he can.<p>For a programmer, the core of our trade is algorithms, and their combinations. You may not need to know them at the smallest details, or even that they are called algorithms, but to accomplish anything you will use them. Combining larger programs together in a specific way to perform something novel is an algorithm, though we may not call it that.<p>Next, data structures, understanding how to store information in a way that your algorithms can use and alter. This underlying knowledge is key to creating larger things from many small things.<p>Next, simplicity, combining logic and code together to accomplish the goals alone is not enough. While it may be simple to combine large things together, the question should exist of whether it could be done more simply. Simplicity can be hard to accomplish, but is easy to appreciate. Simplicity means avoiding cleverness, if possible, as it can make the program hard to be changed or maintained. Simplicity is elegant refinement, which leads to doing small things very well.<p>Those three things, in my mind, are the only pure things necessary to being a programmer. Algorithms, data structures, and simplicity.<p>The reasons none of the other things apply in my mind to the overly-general title of just programmer is that they are not required by every programmer.<p>Text Editor - Cannot pen and paper be used just as well in the task of constructing a program as a text edit?<p>Programming Language - Maybe I could have leniency here, you do need language to describe yourself, but not necessarily a programming language.<p>Databases - This is much higher-level than a regular data-structure, and as such isn&#x27;t a necessity. Applies more to specific fields.<p>Algorithms - Yes, even if not known by name.<p>Math - This isn&#x27;t a requirement, though it is a nicety. Some get by without knowing much more than the very basics of Arithmetic and maybe a little basic Algebra. It applies more to specific fields.<p>Debugging & Testing - These aren&#x27;t necessary, but they help ensure quality or finding issues.<p>Documentation/Comments - If the code is simple enough, it should describe itself. That isn&#x27;t to say documentation and comments aren&#x27;t important, but they aren&#x27;t necessities either. You should describe as much in comments and documentation as necessary, to provide clarity and usable instruction, and is a great skill to have.<p>I hope I&#x27;ve explained things clearly enough. Knowing one&#x27;s craft is understanding the fundamentals, and that comes much further ahead of the tools one uses, within reason. In my opinion the single best thing for describing the craft of programming is the Unix Philosophy[1].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy</a>",1422257130

It&#x27;s quite informative. It also shows that the difference between Japan and most of Europe is somewhat marginal. 8 vs 10.<p>But what would be a &quot;steady-state&quot; birth rate ? Well life expectancy is ~70 years. So 1000 people should produce 1000 offspring in ~70 years. So steady-state birth-rate would be in the 14-15 range. Changes compound over time, so numbers close to 14-15 will effectively be equal to that whereas differences with that number have exponential effects.<p>That seems to indicate that the vast majority of the world is slowly losing population (though that does not -yet- result in large declines of people).

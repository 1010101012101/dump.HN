So the proposition is this: By the model of your partner, you create expectations for users, and then satisfy them. This essentially means people get excited about something, wait for it, and, at best, it eventually happens. So they think ""Yeah, it's finally here."". Your proposition is to keep all that but also have them think ""Yeah, it's finally here, and it's even BETTER than I thought it would be!"". This is distinct from surprise releases and no release schedules, which I suppose is what your partner is thinking about. Raising client expectations is an excellent idea. Exceeding those new expectations is even more excellent. Promise something good. Deliver something better.",1259675807

Rather, he's complaining that the comma operator is append instead of cons, kinda.<p>Note also that here he's talking about a bad decision made ""very early on"", back when Perl had no references; at that point the only way to make anything like nested lists was by giving names to all the sublists and using typeglobs or explicit calls to eval. That's a <i>semantic</i> point and has nothing to do with the syntactic role of parentheses in the grammar. Yes, nowadays you write [1,2,3,[4,5]] instead and make references everywhere, and that's better, but it's still not very nice because Perl references are ugly, and what Yegge's doing here is explaining how Perl came to need something so ugly.",1259675718

He objected to this particular article, which (as it happens) says other things besides ""open access would be a good thing"".<p>The article suggests that part of the peer review process should be an examination of the software used, which is about as practical as saying that an experimental paper's reviewers should visit the lab and examine all the apparatus. (Actually, considerably less practical, as anyone who's ever done any sort of review on any nontrivial piece of software knows.) This is not the same as saying that there should be ""open access"".<p>The article opens by citing an alleged integrity problem in climatology and saying that lack of access to the relevant software is an even bigger problem. This is not the same as saying that there should be ""open access"".<p>The article has a very clear political agenda, as you can note from its beginning (climate-specific stuff, which you yourself have suggested taking as diagnostic for political agenda) and its end (approving links to Eric ""famous computer scientist"" Raymond and TCS Daily). <i>timr</i> is (1) pointing out the political agenda, for which you accuse him of being political, and (2) describing some specific problems he has with the article, which you characterize as ""refuting calls for open access"" even though his complaints do not at all take that form.<p>(I think it would be wonderful if every scientific publication were accompanied by every byte of code and data used in the work it describes, or at least the nearest thing to that that's legally and commercially feasible. But it wouldn't cure the problems that the article professes to find in the peer review process, and the only difference it would make to arguments over climate science is that the no-anthropogenic-global-warming people would find something else to complain about.)",1259675198

969665,comment,967752,968900,0,0,elblanco,,,"I don't know why you got downvoted so hard, I think you have a fair opinion (even though I disagree with it).<p>IMHO, the absolute best programmers I've ever worked with looked at programming as a game, as something clever to do. They reveled in the beauty of elegant code, and they got angry when reading bad code, and laughed heartily at particularly clever code etc.<p>To them, they had internalized the language of the machine and were trying to create art with their code, <i>not</i> science.<p>One thing that I've never been unsure of is that L. Wall understands that machines can be approached 2 ways, either as a raw tool, issuing instructions to be completed precisely as directed. Or the other approach, which is to think of the machine as a being (albeit one with a particularly different kind of mind) and the language is a lingua franca that you can use to communicate with it. Perl false squarely on the side of a programming language being a <i>language</i> (in the communication sense) vs. being a language (in the ""set of instructions"" sense).<p>The reason Perl 1 liners are so interesting, for example, is that they convey implicit little secrets between you and the machine, much like you might do with a certain kind of nod to a friend at a party when a certain topic comes up that conveys a world of meaning between you and your friend.<p>The reason these little ""operators"" are so witty is that they convey lots of meaning between you and the machine relatively simply, and look clever at the same time.<p>I think most programmers at one time or another realize that though, in theory, computers <i>are</i> supposed to do exactly what you've told them to do, the ecosystem their software is running in is just on the edge of nondeterminism and wish for a way to convey to the computer what they ""mean"" for it to do rather than what they tell it to do. ""Machine, I wish for you to open this file and count the number of times the words foo and bar show up in it"". Perl is targeted at these kinds of cases.<p>That's now to say that other languages are bad, just different. Perl also has the unnerving ability to so quickly become obfuscated that it can be very hard to untangle by another developer. Languages like Python aim for code simplicity and readability and thus are much more suitable to large scale development practices than Perl is (that's not to say that Perl isn't used in these kinds of large projects, or that Python isn't used for one off scripts).",1259673716

But that need have nothing to do with the language you learn first.<p>A very large number of the programmers you will meet today learned programming via something like C64 or Applesoft BASIC, or (at best) Turbo Pascal. These languages were not exactly Lisp. In those days, BASIC only had global variables. Our growth was not stunted. The idea that learning BASIC stunts your growth was a load of crap at the time, and it remains a load of crap.<p>If you have the startup itch and want to teach yourself good habits, here's my advice: Don't dither, and don't pick up habits that encourage dithering. Like fretting too much about your language of choice. If you actually plan to build web software, take up Ruby, Python, or even PHP. You know, something normal. Something which features lots of libraries and blogs and books and colleagues and infrastructure.<p>And learn Lisp too. At the same time. Start with SICP, which involves starting with Scheme.

I was referring to the raw data in general, not this specific case.<p>If they did nothing more add known vectors to the data, we can reconstruct the original data once we have access to their code (which they also didn't release). The minute they take a moving average, or use a best fit curve, this becomes impossible.<p>You also still haven't explained why you believe climate science deserves lower levels of care and transparency than econometrics.",1259672728

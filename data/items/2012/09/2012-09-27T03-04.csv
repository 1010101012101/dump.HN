4579252,comment,4578738,4579051,1,0,vikramhaer,,,"Can I ask what the $4 in profit and 30M nights/ year to justify $2B valuation are based on? Just wondering if maybe my math/ view on it is wrong...<p>Looks like they charge a 3% fee meaning a night @ $100 would bring in $3 of revenue (not profit). At 30M nights that's $90M in revenue, putting the $2B valuation at 22.2x revenue... seems slightly unreasonable (at least not a valuation that public markets are likely to put on it). Thoughts?",1348718352

The forums there listed the same things people here are complaining about. It was all said on those forums, we were just under NDA not to talk about it.<p>Which leads me to believe this was an upper management push and they are willing to deal with the PR fallout. beta 1 maps was really really bad, gm is workable. It has improved a ton during the betas, and that was a 2 month-ish spread. I'll give Apple a few months to clean up the data, it makes Core Location way more useful than when it was tied to Googles' api. Note this is for things like the vector road parts of the map, you can basically have your location clamped to the road. Sometimes gps signals are... erratic when driving in cities, this helps things out immensely. But we'll see if it is another ping or not.",1348718325

4579246,comment,4577133,4577517,2,0,russelluresti,,,"Here's my issue with the ""advancement"" that Bret is doing. It's all conjecture. He has no product. He has no users. He has theories. Theories that sound good to you and me, but, ultimately, theories that are untested and unproven. There's no evidence that any of these changes would actually help anyone learn to program any better. Who is to say that a person new to coding wouldn't be overwhelmed by the amount of information Bret's system is asking them to process? There's a pretty strong case for cognitive overload when you have lines of code, different code hints that appear not just over every line, but every function and number, a time bar with many different symbols on it, etc. But, again, no benefits or faults can be found with Bret's proposed approach because it's untested and unproven. Conjecture, hypotheses, and assumptions.<p>This is where Khan Academy exceeds. They have users. They have real people really trying to learn how to code. This means they can test their assumptions and modify their approach. An imperfect solution delivered today is better than a perfect solution delivered next week.",1348718270

4579236,comment,4578059,4578614,3,0,geebee,,,"If a shortage can't exist by definition, then maybe we need a new term, or a different way of thinking about a shortage.  I am willing to listen to people who claim there is a shortage of engineers, though I am skeptical of the claim.<p>I think about it this way - how does the pay, prestige, job stability, growth, and forth for an engineer compare to the other options available for highly talented people?  As it stands, I think that it does make sense that there would be higher demand than supply for engineers at the current salary levels.<p>As an example, I read about a guy with a PhD in Engineering from a strong program and several years work experience who was writing specialized software.  His salary was 125K a year.  The article was about granting more visas to non-us citizens, and the writer clearly thought the 125K salary ended all discussion of whether the pay was extraordinary, high enough that clearly a shortage was in effect.<p>Personally, I don't agree.  This guy had gone through a grad degree that typically takes 6 years or more (twice as long as a law degree, 3 years as long as an MBA, as long as a med degree and half of a residency).  He had gone through a much harder undergrad degree than most, and he had already proved his ability to write difficult code.  125k isn't close to ""shortage level"" salaries for someone like this.  I know employers would get sticker shock, but I think you'd have to go up to 250K or more to be competitive with comparable professions (at the elite level).  Keep in mind, 6 years of a PhD + a few years of work experience would be equivalent to a 6th year associate at a law firm - but without the extra years of earning.<p>I'm willing to consider the possibility of a shortage, but right now the evidence seems very weak.  In fact, the salary level for engineers compared to other top professions goes a long way to explaining the low interest in these degrees, especially at the grad level.",1348718142

I'm going to speak mostly from the side of one doing the recruiting, because that was where I had the chance to actually learn why people were sought or avoided, accepted or rejected. When you're a candidate, you only have your own conjectures about why you get yeses and nos, but when you're involved in recruiting, you get a front-row seat for how stupid companies can be.<p>Companies think that if they set requirements 3 levels above the actual work, they'll get it done really well, very fast, and reliably.<p>That's not true. It doesn't work that way. It's the opposite.<p>Companies are afraid to hire at-level because they can't admit the truth about the quality of work they have to offer. Most of what they are doing is not very interesting, and their environments are often broken, but they're terrified that if they hire at-level for that work, they'll poison the environment with inferior programmers. Reality: the culture was already damaged by the crappy work. It's a sunk cost if that's the kind of work you have to do, so fucking accept it and hire at-level.<p>There's also a social-climbing element to it that is pretty disgusting. I've seen this with startups. They hire the people they can get-- a few are bad, a few are great, most are OK-to-good-- but then, after they're more established and richer, they decide that none of those people are ""good enough"" to grow with the company, so they decide to upgrade their crowd and hire shiny, new people. Familiarity breeds contempt, so eventually they are used-up shoes and newer, shinier people need to be brought on. (This is why, if you're an early startup hire, you need to lock in a VP-level title even if you're a full-time programmer. You can never get full assurance that people won't be hired above you from outside, but the title makes it harder. It puts a limit on that sort of shit.)<p>There's also a ridiculous pansy-ass risk aversion involved. ""We can't do machine learning unless we hire a machine learning expert with 20 years of production experience."" Bull-fucking-shit. So many companies refuse to get out there and do something interesting until they can hire a Messiah, and people anything like that Messiah want to work for companies that are <i>already doing</i> interesting work.",1348715918

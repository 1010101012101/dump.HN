A friend advised me to start with Dreamweaver which was indeed very helpful and confortable when I began coding in the late 90's but after a while, I got fedup of the constant spoonfeeding and I didn't really need all the wysiwyg tools anymore so I switched to BBEdit which was the de facto text editor on Mac OS at the time.<p>I still used BBEdit and/or TextWrangler until I fell in love with TextMate sometime between 06 and 07 and, later, the command line.<p>Then I got bored and decided to switch to Linux full time. I spent almost a year looking for a TextMate alternative and found Vim to be the best candidate. And ultimately blow TextMate in every ways. To be honest, I'd have gone with ST2 if it existed at that time, though.<p>Give me a real keyboard, an UNIX-y system, a terminal emulator, exuberant ctags and Vim and I'm a happy man.",1355687980

B. the news about India;s growth has not trickled into these countries, with a very repressed media.

4929297,comment,4928031,4929179,13,0,ForrestN,,,"Wow! You're doing exactly what you seem to know on some level is bad: you're giving him lots of very specific advice without having any basis for doing so. Apologies for any harshness but I want to answer you strongly.<p>1. It's very possible that leaving his current therapist in order to ""pivot"" is a terrible idea. He should talk to his current therapist about his feelings that therapy isn't work, and consider talking to another professional, maybe one who takes a different approach, <i>at the same time</i> until he feels clarity about what to do. A lot of work gets done in 7 years of therapy. Sometimes there are low points, but it is a major step to throw that away.<p>2. It's incredibly obvious that telling him to try to have a child is an <i>insanely bad idea</i>. Getting a dog is less conspicuously destructive but is also a serious commitment and not something you're in a position to recommend.<p>3. Your ""tough love"" approach just sounds like being gratuitously hard on yourself. You can't bully yourself into becoming healthy. His condition isn't ""fabricated"" by his brain, and he cannot talk himself out of it. I know you didn't mean it in this spirit, but the ultimate effect of that line of thinking is putting responsibility for his problems on his own shoulders. No one chooses to have psychological issues, and they can't just opt out of them either.<p>4. The rest, doing jumping jacks, taping up yoda quotes, answering a mental health questionnaire in public, these things aren't likely damaging in any way, but they won't do anything to address the underlying problems or meaningfully change the situation in question.<p>Again, OP: if you feel that your current treatment isn't working, you need to address that by talking to your therapist about it and, if that doesn't help you feel more optimistic about the current regime, you need to talk to someone else <i>at the same time</i> about the current problems you're having. If you have to make a drastic change, like leaving your current therapist and presumably changing your meds, I'd think it would be a good idea to involve someone you trust who can help give you perspective from outside of the therapeutic context.<p>And, obviously, if you get to anywhere near self-harm, make sure to get emergency care right away, even if it seems like an over-reaction.",1355687525

For similar reasons.  And I believe that my comparison touches on why each of those criticisms is paralleled.<p>I freely admit, though, that the weakest parallel is to Java.  Programmers who are not enamored of deep object hierarchies despise those designs when Java programmers try to implement them in any language.  But love of deep object hierarchies is not unique to Java (though it does tend to be extreme there).  Nor is Java as crippled as COBOL.<p>As for COBOL and other use cases - I would be willing to bet large sums that it would have had many other use cases had the people programming in it had access to computers that could run it for a reasonable price.<p>And finally, I did not post that comparison to slag on languages.  I posted it to provide context for Dijkstra's quote.  In fact I, personally, have spent a lot of my professional life programming in Perl - which is one of the languages that I offered up for criticism.

In the end it's a sweet spot, and many times the features number in the hundreds or thousands, so you can't analyze by hand.<p>Automatic feature selection and disentangling is an amazing new advancement that came 7 years ago with the deep learning papers.

After about six months, they did their first major server upgrade - buying an external USB hard drive for more storage. They bought another two (and a USB hub) a month or so later. This lasted them another four months, until the got to the point where the USB bus was being constantly saturated. Only then did they move to some more enterprisey hardware.<p>Moral of their story was to use only as much hardware as you need now (while having plans on how to scale up in the short- and medium-term which don't cost you money now), and to worry more about getting users and building a product. Worry about scaling after you've got customers (and data that will show you actual use patterns), as opposed to paying for a complex scaling infrastructure before you've got any users.",1355686876
4929269,comment,4928354,4928484,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"The problem is primarily that the MBTI is misapplied and misunderstood.<p>It is misunderstood by most people as a set of absolutes without any nuances, whereas it's generally intended to simply classify dominant modes of thinking. i.e., most people will have some problems that they approach one way and other problems that they approach another way, but they will also have a tendency to approach most problems in one of a few ways.<p>Think of it as handedness: most people have a dominant hand, but that doesn't mean that they use <i>only</i> their dominant hand for everything, and that doesn't mean that people can't change their handedness.<p>Because of the way that it's misunderstood, it's also misapplied by a couple of groups of people: those gullible people that are seeking either self-understanding or validation without putting any real effort in, and those people that make a living by going around selling snake-oil psychology.<p>So, while certain professional fields do exhibit certain MBTI trends, it should <i>not</i> be used as a way to determine what profession someone would be best at, or what relationships they should have, or any of that other nonsense. Likewise, all of that ""ABCDs behave like this or that or the other thing"" stuff is all bullshit too.<p>That said, MBTI can be a useful tool. I use it to listen for certain cues in conversations, and then I slightly change my behavior in the conversation to communicate better with the other person. For instance, I listen to whether the person tends to say, ""I feel like ..."" versus ""I think...""; one tells me to communicate with them emotionally, the other rationally. Another cue is in paying attention to whether a person tends to communicate action or observation. In a management context, you can generally rely on an ""action"" person to let you know if they think something needs to be done (or they'll just do it, if you've granted them the freedom); conversely, an observant person might be even more useful in a group, but you're going to have to take some initiative to find out what they see.<p>I could have learned to do these things without ever learning about the MBTI, but the MBTI made it easier for me to figure out what I should watch out for.<p>That said, I have exactly zero identity as a particular MBTI type, and it has otherwise zero guidance on my life or relationships, as it should.",1355686871

(If we're way off the mark for how many people would use this, that's obviously a good thing to know.) PGP encryption can indeed work with any mail service but it's way too cumbersome for the average person, and ""deleting any non-encrypted incoming email"" wouldn't really be sufficient--to my knowledge there's no public data on the amount of time between Google flagging an item as being deleted and the time where it actually disappears from all disks but due to backups, etc, I would expect it to be a really long time.<p>Either way, for external (non-gmail) messages unless both parties are using PGP the whole exchange can easily be intercepted at any point along the way (users are connected to gmail over SSL but external email servers typically aren't). Many people send sensitive information over email without any hesitation (eg. it's probably the most commonly used method for exchanging passwords) and the amount of ways your benign emails could be used against you (in court or otherwise) is probably scarier than you think. You don't need to be plotting a violent overthrow of the government for your words to be used against you.<p>EDIT: FWIW, it's really hard to talk about this stuff without sounding like the guy on the street corner with a placard. I don't think a rogue employee at Google is going to destroy your life, nor do I expect the thought police to someday arrest you based on your email history.

On the other hand, a programming language that can't model ordering of events along some sort of timeline isn't useful for many practical applications, and monads have so far proven to be the most effective way of introducing those concepts into Haskell's naturally timeless environment. They're also absurdly overcomplicated for modelling simple but not trivial cases, relative to just writing the code in the order you want things to happen in an imperative language.

Consider the Borges story ""Hombre de la esquina rosada"". That translates directly to ""The Man of the Pink Corner."" But the ""corner"" here means also the corner store, so it's not just the physical corner but also the ""hangout for the low-life of the barrio."" (I'm quoting from the translator's notes here.) Moreover, the ""pink"" refers to the pastel hues popular in earlier decades, so the pink implies an older neighborhood ""populated by toughs and knife fighters.""<p>If you knew Buenos Aires of 100 years ago then you would infer that directly from the title.

It's not as direct, but it might be better.<p>How do you explain those nuances to a computer?<p>Douglas Hofstader gives more examples of the difficulties in natural language to natural language translation. How does one translate a nonsense poem like ""Jabberwocky""? One French translation starts ""Il brilgue: les tves lubricilleux. Se gyrent en vrillant dans le guave...""<p>Or, and I quote from his Gdel, Escher, Bach: Take a look at the first sentence of Dostoevsky's novel 'Crime and Punishment' in Russian and then in a few different English translations... The first sentence employs the street name ""S. Pereulok"" (as transliterated). What is the meaning of this? A careful reader of Dostoevsky's work who knows Leningrad ... can discover by doing some careful checking of the rest of the geography in the book ... that the street must be 'Stoliaryny Peteulok"". .. should we keep the initial so as to reproduce the aura of semi-mystery which appears already in this first sentence of the book? We could get to ""S. Lane"", (""lane"" being the standard translation of ""pereulok""). None of the translators took this tack. However, one chose to write ""S. Place"". [The second] gave the translation as ""Stoliarny Place"". What about number 3? That's the most interesting of all. The translation says ""Carpenter's Lane."" And why not, indeed? After all, ""stoliar"" means ""carpenter"" and ""ny"" is an adjectival ending.<p>He then goes on to argue that perhaps we should just read Dickens instead, since Dickens is, at some level, a ""translation"" of the Dosteovsky novel.<p>BTW, Google Translate gives ""S. Lane"", which none of the three translators used. As that's the obvious and most direct translation, which the humans didn't choose, I assume that we can say it's not the perfect translation.<p>How would an automatic translation system, without AI, look at "".

It is generally believed that modules which make use of highly Linux-specific internal infrastructure can be considered derived works of the kernel and thus required to be released under GPL. It's not always perfectly clear what is allowed and what is not and hardware vendors are reluctant to find it out in court. Some kernel APIs are explicitly marked as not callable from proprietary modules and the module loader enforces this. As a famous example, NVIDIA claims that inability to use one of these APIs prevents them from supporting Optimus in their video driver.<p>Hardware vendors who don't want to open their drivers need to work around these issues. They can either divide the driver into open-source Linux-specific part and closed-source ""hardware support library"" which avoids calling suspicious kernel APIs, or simply move the whole driver to a userspace shared library and give userspace processes access to the hardware.",1355686485

I basically self medicate with beer, probably too often.<p>I've battled depression since my mid teens, going on this long crusade to be ""successful"" (whatever that means), trying to meet girls, working odd jobs that weren't in line with my degree, sort of living an antiauthoritarian hacker lifestyle that might sound familiar.<p>Anyway, one thing I've learned that's helped me largely overcome it is that things change.  The world is a lot bigger than you are.  My depression was largely caused by isolation, spending too much time in my own mind, trying to fix big problems that nobody else could see.  Most of my days were filled with this ongoing saga of trying to solve programming problems or money problems or political problems, but the common theme is that I always failed to really ""solve"" anything, and felt like my life was a kind of revolving door, every day was the same, rinse, repeat.<p>So the last two years I was unemployed, maybe earning $6,000 a year and making up the rest by borrowing or selling things on eBay, all the time living under about $40,000 worth of debt and student loans.  I had a falling out with my business partner after making a somewhat notable Mac game.<p>Then all at once two months ago, a good friend I grew up with got me a contracting job earning six figures, depending on how long the contract lasts.  I'm not making this up.  I hesitate to say I love my job, that's an awfully strong word, but it's certainly not terrible.  I have that sense that I should have tried it a decade ago.<p>I've done all kind of things, I worked out for years and got ripped, I womanized, I snowboarded, I traveled, I visited my father in the third world and fixed some family bonds, I bought a house with my girlfriend, I bought the truck I always wanted from Back to the Future, and got a puppy.  This was in the years before I started my job, when I was depressed.  In fact, in some ways I think I was more effective when I had nothing going for me.<p>Now by bank account has more than $100 in it for the first time in years, I'm still relatively young, I have my health.  But I know in my heart that I didn't really do any of this.  Life is a dream.  I'm still the same old fraud I always was, bumbling along like all the other morons.  What I'm trying to say is that even though the universe reconfigured itself around me for some reason, I'm still not really sure why, I'm still haunted by the same existential questions that have always bothered me.  Even if I had a million dollars, I would still be unable to achieve the things I really want to see in this life like meeting aliens or curing death or talking to a sentient computer, that are unlikely to happen anytime soon.  There is always another reason to feel gypped.  And it's not like I ever had a need for money anyway other than to get people to leave me alone.<p>Basically the cultural framework we've all built around us, concepts like money and achievement, being in the zone, selflessness, love, are all a distraction.  There's just you, interacting with this strange reality that is both insubstantial and more clever than you could ever conceive of.  The universe doesn't care that you're depressed.  It keeps trying things to test you and taunt you and nobody knows why.<p>I guess what I'm trying to get at is that there's no magic bullet like pills or diet or exercise that will make you feel not depressed.  I think of depression as misdirected free will, and only because you feel bad because of it, there's nothing inherently wrong with it in and of itself, and I think most people have felt it even if they're in denial about it.  If you think of the things that make you feel bad, and what it would be like to let them go, ask yourself why you don't do it.<p>For example, if bills have got you down, have you tried not paying them yet.  If work is bumming you out, have you tried quitting.  If you don't feel loved in your relationship, have you taken a break.  I tried checking out of my responsibilities several times over the last decade, and although it didn't fix my depression, it gave me some breathing room to meditate on why I was still unhappy.  It's kind of nice to feel that people needed you and were relying on you, and I didn't feel all that bad that I let them down.  At least not as bad as I expected to.<p>I assume that anyone reading Hacker News is a highly effective person, so if you find that you are unable to perform at the level that you know you can, then something is wrong, and it could very well be something outside of yourself.  Sometimes the universe needs signals that you are unhappy so that it can recalibrate its approach and give you something more to your liking.<p>I've sort of begun to take a philosophical view of all of this, that somehow our collective consciousness forms the reality around us, and that we have a responsibility to be true to ourselves so that we can contribute something beyond our basic survival to the soup.  You could literally fail today, completely and utterly, and wake up tomorrow with an opportunity you couldn't have possibly foreseen.  Then the real kicker is that when you look around at the seemingly improbable configuration of the world, it seems that this is actually the general nature of things.  I look at it as, the only real responsibility any of us has is to keep living, and by just doing that, it gives the universe a stage to play on.<p>I take it a step further, that when it's my time to expire, that I'll be reincarnated before I can blink in another arrangement of atoms somehow sentient enough to comprehend its own existence.  But I don't want to get into religion.  I'm just saying that to think that we can somehow end our consciousness may very well be a fallacy.  We may have spent a million generations as amoebas and sea cucumbers to reach this level of sophistication, and there are no guarantees that the next life will be any more fulfilling than this one.  We have billions of years of evolution at our fingertips and we don't even realize the power it gives us.  We sit around feeling sorry for ourselves like a Greek tragedy and fool ourselves into thinking that this is all there is.  It's really quite extraordinary.<p>So I hope that all of you keep living and doing what you do so I have something to do while I'm trapped is this crazy reality too.<p>P.S.

However, after being convinced to try this one by a friend, essentially doing it so that they would stop asking, I found the results to be shockingly accurate, and subsequently found this to be the common reaction for people that happen to have the same type. In my ongoing skepticism, I've read explanations and definitions for several other types, pretending they were mine, to see if I could somehow relate to all of them, but failed miserably. The wording was never vague, as in the case of astrology, for example, and the descriptions of my type all precisely described me, personally. Up until now, I presumed that this would be the case for everybody, but I see a lot of dismissal here. I would conjecture that either those people did not actually find their MB type, or that the results only appear to be impressive for certain types, like mine. To be fair, this was the first time that I answered one of those tests truthfully. During school, I'd give the answers for which I assumed I'd be less scrutinized for; for work, I'd give the answers I assumed were more likely to get me promoted.<p>In any case, I found finding my type to be beneficial. The typical interview question ""tell me about yourself"" was always the one I dreaded the most, and finding my type has not only increased my awareness of who I am, but given me a way to explain it to others as well. The results have also brought me to see that I may not always be right after all, and that people who agree with me might simply belong to the same or similar category. Put differently, I now think that different types, while most of them clash with me, are necessary for the functioning of society, and I don't need to agree with them, or them to agree with me. Note that ""live and let live"" is apparently a defining characteristic of this particular type, which I got a good belly laugh discovering by reading another comment.

We knew not to test her. All of my brothers and sisters grew up to be decent human beings.<p>In case you are wondering, my brother never beats his kids, is enough for them to see him mad when they misbehave for them to fall in line.<p>I concede, had he had a mental disorder it would probably not have worked. In this case though, I'm not sure the OP really had a mental disorder which is why I suggested the beating.

4929213,comment,4928031,4928031,2,0,helpingstranger,,,"Hey far_far_away,<p>I feel for you. I've been battling depression every single day for the last 14 years. And most people don't realize this when they see me as the happiness guy in the room. But the analytical-startup-side of me has kept a <i>log</i> of every day, of what works and what doesn't work to change my behavior and mood. Here's what I've found and I hope this helps:<p>When I'm happy:<p>- It's when I've written up some code, and feel accomplished<p>- I've had realistic expectations (of when I finish a project, what I expect from social gatherings, etc)<p>- I'm not so stressed (and this comes from sleeping on time, doing things in moderation)<p>When I'm close to being suicidal:<p>- I have high stress levels<p>- My plans are not working out as expected (read unrealistic expectations)<p>- There has been no balance of work/play (say I oversleep, read HN all day and feel unaccomplished)<p>What to take away from this:<p>It comes down to stress and expectations. Sleeping early (even though I'm a night owl, and produce great code at night) makes a difference. When you live in the suburbs and no one's there to talk to at night, it really does suck, when the whole town sleeps at 6am. I've gone through several therapists, but the analytical side of me wants to figure out this challenge for myself. It sucks, I know. But maybe for now, write down all that you're thinking, watch a movie, play some video games, and take time to yourself, to enjoy, to be happy. And set your phone's wallpaper to ""Life is good. Be happy."" (I emailed you the wallpaper). It's just one of those life hacks when you wake up, when you retreat from the world, and decline to answer someone's phone-call, you see your wallpaper, and it rewires your brain into associating certain actions with a positive mood. Know that the change won't come overnight, and know that your actions affect everyone around you. I started looking outward and praying for others, when that put less focus on me, less stress on my startup, and less stress on relationships. Sorry for the rambling. Remember the power to bring change to the world is in any one person's hands - it could be yours - you can see it as a burden or an opportunity - take care of yourself and be easy.",1355685604

I wasn't looking to bypass market validation, or solving poeple's problems.<p>So, going back to the underlying question of starting businesses, how do you go about finding a market, finding problems, finding solutions to those problems, and finding paying customers?  Preferably all without wasting a ton of time or money?<p>I hope Patrick replies to this thread and walks us through his process.  Did Patrick start with the teachers market because he knew some teachers?  Did he ask them what problems they had?  Did they complain to him that were dying to play classroom bingo, that the existing solutions are terrible, and that they would pay him if he provided a solution?<p>I know some people involved in trades, some in education, finance, and consulting.  Several of these people are either the business owners themselves, or have the authority to pay for software solutions to their problems.  These are primarily offline markets.

What problems they have with current software solutions they use?",1355685183
4929197,comment,4927404,4927599,3,0,Mz,,,"A few randomish thoughts:<p>The U.S. (and Australia, which was a penal colony) likely has a higher than average (at least for Europe) incidence of what I will call ""maverick"" traits -- gene based traits that make people less able to go along to get along, for some reason.  They aren't necessarily bad traits, they just aren't very conducive to ""domestication"". The tend to be some of the same traits necessary for activities like exploration and other risky behaviors -- including founding a start up. One of the things YC asks about on its application is rule breaking behaviors. Folks who are too compliant are not well suited for doing groundbreaking work. So I don't personally think that breeding these traits out is necesarily a good thing.<p>The reason America has higher rates is because a lot of our ancestors left Europe (or other countries) when they just could not fit in. Many left to seek the right to worship as they saw fit -- in other words to think and believe as they wished. So it looks to me like Europe already tried to get rid of these genes and, instead of extinguishing them, mostly exported them, thereby concentrating them in a couple of countries. People with these genes tend to not ""go quietly into the night"". They tend to go kicking and screaming. So I do not think criminalizing people for having such traits is a good policy. It is better to find ways to help them live constructively with certain traits and to carefully distinguish between traits, which are value neutral, and outcomes or behaviors, which are not value neutral.<p>I usually do not say this publically, but if Joan of Arc were alive today, she would likely be in a psych ward having her meds adjusted, trying to make the voices stop, instead of playing midwife to the bloody birth of modern Fance. I have also read that Alexander the Great was likely bipolar. Again: I am not so sure that our desire to rid ourselves of people who aren't ""normal""/adequately compliant or ""cure"" them of their differences is such a good thing. I think there are better ways to deal with peope like that than simply trying to break them. I think the goal of breaking them is likely a loss for both the individual being broken and for society. Take that too far and we lose important human traits, like adaptability.<p>I have a genetic disorder. It is more common in populations which historically were subjected to high death rates from a particular infectious disease (though I don't recall which disease). In other words, carrying at least one gene was likely protective against dying from this infection. Thus this deadly genetic disorder became more common in cases where it helped you survive in the face of worse things. The same is true of Sickle Cell disease, which is protective against malaria. Viewing genetic variations of that sort solely as defects and not as adaptations misses the big picture. If they weren't adaptive in some situations, they wouldn't be selected for by evolutionary pressure.",1355685173

The list isn't exhaustive.  I am not a therapist, not even close.  As an entrepreneur I have navigated depression from time to time.  It can be ugly and paralyzing.  It also is very personal.  That's why a lot more information is needed to really understand you and how you go in and out of that state.<p>From personal experience I can tell you that it helps to have what I have come to call ""non-maskable interrupts"".  In my case this came in the form of my kids.  It's pretty hard to focus on being miserable when your little one's push and pull you into their world.  It's great.<p>If you don't have this option then you have to find another interrupt source.  This means focusing your energy and thoughts on another activity not related to work.<p>Martial arts class can be great.  A good class can dissolve away the stress of a days' worth of troubles within a short hour.  On top of that you are getting exercise which by itself should make you feel better.<p>Gyms can suck.  If you can find a friend who'd like to go to the gym with you this could be a good exercise + social option.<p>Swimming.  If you don't know how to swim, join a group and learn.  I don't know if you are in the US or not.  In the US there's something called US Masters Swimming (usmg.org).  They have groups everywhere.  Sign-up and get in a pool.  For me, there's nothing like swimming a 1500m or 3000m run.  I come out of the pool like a newborn.<p>Get a dog.  The therapeutic value of dogs is well proven.  Also, puppies, just like kids, have a unique ability to shift your mind's focus away from you and onto them.  Research the breed a little.  If you are the type, get into training.  I have always had German Shepherd Dogs and have always enjoyed training them (research: schutzhund).  GSD's are not for everyone.  A good pet dog like a Labrador could do wonders for you.  There are professional organizations that deal in therapy dogs who can advise you based on your circumstances and needs.<p>Notice that every suggestion I've made involves disconnecting from work and strongly focusing your energy and attention elsewhere. Physical, outdoor and social activities being another common theme.<p>I couldn't possibly relate to your child abuse experience or the years of therapy and medicine.  I am fortunate in that I have not had to experience any of this.  That said, it sure sounds like you need to pivot and go talk to a different therapist.  Your current on doesn't seem to be helping you much.<p>I am one of those people who will do the impossible NOT to introduce any drugs into my body unless there's absolutely no other option.  I could not imagine taking ten pills a day just to be able to function.  There has to be another way.<p>Not being a therapist I don't really know if talking to others about your problems will help you or push you deeper into a more dangerous state.  That's why I am not inclined to offer to contact you via email.  It is very easy to justify feeling worst and use someone else as a bouncing board for those feelings.  I really think you need to find a new therapist to talk to immediately.<p>Then, of course, there's the tough love approach.  Unless you suffer from a fundamental chemical imbalance your condition is one that is entirely fabricated by your brain.  As such, you can --and should learn to-- control it.  I did this with anxiety attacks.  They can be nasty.  Once you understand how to recognize and deal with the symptoms you can literally talk yourself out of one (or prevent entering it in the first place).<p>This is where I'll be cheesy and quote Yoda: ""Your Focus Determines Your Reality"".  Print that and tape it where you can see it.  What are you focusing on?  What reality will that produce?  Is that what you want?  No?  Then change your focus.<p>The techniques can be simple.

Threatening to kill people almost certainly falls on this list.<p>Not only that, but some people, such as people with schizophrenic disorders, <i>need</i> medicine (Specifically, pharmaceuticals.) to stay sane, literally. Part of the problem with disorders where you need to take pills are that some people don't want to take them, or the pills help them, and then they decide they're fine and stop medicating themselves. At which point they relapse into an episode.<p>I think we absolutely need better mental health care, and better mental health care research. We still don't know much about basic things like <i>sleep</i>. And yet we're being tasked with treating a growing number of people with psychiatric issues.

They have several chapters with empirical evidence that the open-plan office is bad for software engineers (or anyone that needs to concentrate and work in 'flow' mode)<p>It sounds like your open-plan company was an exception though. Personally we have 50 people in our open-plan office and I hate it. I can't get into flow without loud music via my headphones.",1231901944

433067,comment,432862,433011,0,0,gravitycop,,,"<i>the requirement would be more that you need to actively be pursuing the thing you're patenting, instead of simply reserving the idea.</i><p>Perhaps the patent-holder could be required to maintain a website that shows how to reduce the invention to practice. However, all US patents are already published online, and, by definition, they all show how to reduce to practice. A caveat is that patents can sometimes remain secret for a number of years before being disclosed by the USPTO. Besides that, patents are enforced at least back to their initial filing dates (not their issuing dates), and therefore a company could be working on a product for several years without having any way of knowing that a patent on that product had been applied-for before they started.<p>-<p>The USPTO <i>does</i> have a method in place for encouraging patent-holders to market their inventions. It is the patent maintenance-fee schedule:<p><a href=""http://robertplattbell.blogspot.com/2007/10/understanding-maintenance-fees.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robertplattbell.blogspot.com/2007/10/understanding-ma...</a><p><i>U.S. Maintenance fees are progressive, so each successive fee is much more than the previous one. The idea is to encourage inventors to allow their Patents to expire unless they are actually being used. The Government does not want inventors to “sit on” Patents with the hope that maybe somebody will someday infringe, and then they can sue. With the Maintenance Fees, it is “use it or lose it”.<p>Maintenance Fees are raised periodically along with all other Patent Fees, so it is hard to say exactly what they will be. At the time of this writing (July, 2005) the fees are as follows:</i><p><pre><code>    YEAR      Large Entity     Small Entity
   3 Years:        $900             $450
   7 Years:      $2,300           $1,150
  11 Years:      $3,800           $1,900
</code></pre>
If these maintenance fees are not presently doing the job, perhaps they should be raised. How about multiplying the figures above by 1,000? That way, the final maintenance fee for a large entity would be $3.8 million.",1231900328

433044,comment,431285,432105,0,0,11ren,,,"Yeah, I was thinking that. You're also omitting an explicit <i>return</i>, I would guess by assuming the value of the last statement (as an expression) is to be returned (this won't work in general, because Javascript allows multiple returns, like C or Java). It's closer to a lisp syntax, by using nested lists instead of structs/maps. I submit that it's against the spirit of JSON to be able to name the values, and then not use that ability.

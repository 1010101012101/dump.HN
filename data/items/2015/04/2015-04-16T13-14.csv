Both environments have their advantages and disadvantages. If you have a hacker mindset that doesn&#x27;t mind negotiating the perils of configuration files and the command line, perhaps Linux is the better choice. If however you prefer to spend more time just getting stuff done... ;)<p>In all seriousness though, having attempted to learn Linux on a number of occasions, trying to make the leap from one O/S to another isn&#x27;t a cakewalk. They&#x27;re structured differently, operate differently, configured differently, have different UI paradigms - it takes a big mental effort and a bunch of time few of us have to spare to cross that chasm. If you grew up in a Windows environment, it&#x27;s not hard to see why you&#x27;d think Linux sucks.

You are using a virtual machine to mimic your production environment, right?<p>I have Win8 desktop and MBPr laptop and develop on both about 70/30.  Brew is nice and all (tho has made me howl in frustration numerous times) but I want stuff running on the exact same software as what I deploy.<p>Between work and pleasure I use a mix of PHP, Ruby, Java, Node, and Python (well and Haskell.. hello coworker! /wave).  Not that I actively develop in all of those but will use other programs written in them and sometimes modify the source.  CLI on mac is better than cygwin on PC, but I have had hiccups with both getting the right packages/libraries installed.  OSX is far from the holy land imo.<p>I never have a hair pulling event on Ubuntu installing things, sadly I am too frustrated with the NON-CLI parts of Ubuntu to make it my primary OS.<p>I have all of those languages installed &quot;natively&quot; (ie not through cygwin) on Windows so linting works in Intellij.  For SPAs I can use bower,grunt,gulp,livereload etc in cygwin just as easily as OSX.  I&#x27;ve not tried installing Haskell on windows, I run that in my VM exclusively.<p>Right now my biggest gripe is Ansible is a b<i></i><i></i> to get working in windows, but it can work.

When you know the hardware you can shave away the <i>upper</i> layers.<p>Consider e.g. AmigaOS.<p>AmigaOS let you obtain a pointer directly to the screen bitmap to update your window contents with no buffering or clipping. It could do that because originally all the hardware was the same, or close enough.<p>Then graphics cards came along, and you didn&#x27;t necessarily have a way of writing directly to the bitmap. Suddenly you had to use WritePixel() and ReadPixel() and similar, which would obtain the screen pointer for the window, and obtain the display the screen is on, and find the driver corresponding to the screen, and call the appropriate driver function via a jump table.<p>Similarly, the AmigaOS had functions to e.g. install copper lists (the copper was a very primitive co-processor that could be used to do things like change the palette at specific scan lines), which also wouldn&#x27;t work at all on graphics cards.<p>This is why knowing the hardware is part of a limited set matters: You can define your API to match the hardware very precisely, or even expose hardware features directly.",1429192490

9387887,comment,9386820,9386820,0,0,luxpir,,,"Some key points from the article, translated...<p>---<p><pre><code>  It was in a nearly empty senate that around thirty deupties
  cast their votes [...] on the installation of &quot;black boxes&quot;,
  a controversial device designed to monitor internet traffic.
  [It was] approved by 25 deupties to 5 following heated debates.

  The plan: to force ISPs to &quot;detect, through automated
  processing, a suspect succession of connection data&quot; that
  appear to match patterns typically used by terrorists. In 
  practice, this would involve installing a &quot;black box&quot; at ISPs
  to monitor traffic. The content of the communications would
  not be monitored, but only the metadata: the sender or
  receiver of a message, the IP address of a visited site...

  [...]

  &quot;The black box is the Pandora&#x27;s box of this draft law,&quot; said
  socialist Aurélie Filippetti in the senate. &quot;They say that the
  masses of data that will flow through it will only contain
  metadata. But they contain even more information about the
  private lives of our fellow citizens! [...] And there is a
  paradox in saying that these data will be anonymous when they
  are to be used to identify terrorists&quot;.

  An accusation that was then defended by the government in the
  house, &quot;The automated processing marks out suspect behaviour,
  not pre-identified persons,&quot; emphasized the Defence Minister,
  Jean-Yves Le Drian, &quot;It is after that the services are able to
  access the identity of the persons.&quot;

  [...]

  Some deputies also pointed out the &quot;economically damaging&quot;
  consequences of these black boxes, such as the ecologist
  Isabelle Attard, for whom &quot;French IT companies will see their
  foreign clients start to desert them as they lose their trust&quot;.
  Last week, seven large French hosts made their opposition to the
  draft clear, stating that it would push them &quot;into exile&quot; so as
  not to lose their clients.

  [...]

  The government nevertheless eluded the more technical questions
  throughout the debate, asked, several times, by a few deputies,
  among those was Laure de la Raudière (UMP), &quot;Where are you going
  to install your probe on the communication networks?&quot;, &quot;How will
  you optimize the algorithms?&quot;, &quot;Will you use deep packet
  inspection?&quot;.

  Bernard Cazeneuve ended up replying to this last question,
  repeated several times by the deputy, &quot;We will not use this
  technique at all&quot;, a technique that involves the deep inspection
  [translation of a translation...] of all passing communications
  data.

  Several deputies have also demanded a precise list of the type of
  metadata collected by the black boxes to be clearly defined.
  In vain.

For other tasks, Ansible provides better tools, and hey, you can call Ansible from your shell scripts!<p>I&#x27;ve added a few ansible-friendly options to some of my shell scripts like adding an --ansible-mode flag that then outputs just a one-line &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Changed&quot; message that then I have Ansible parse to determine if something changed during the run. Or if you&#x27;re more ambitious you can just turn your shell scripts into Ansible modules by having them take arguments in a slightly different way and output JSON.<p>A free templating system (Jinja2) and cross-platform capabilities are nothing to shake a stick at either. Not to mention, Ansible does a good job of helping organize your hosts and parameters in one place, and forces you to modularize your &quot;scripts&quot; (in the form of playbooks and roles) in a beneficial way.<p>It&#x27;s definitely worth a look. You can start small, and use it only for one thing, and grow from there. That&#x27;s one of its biggest benefits over Puppet and Chef, which don&#x27;t really have a way to go small-scale.",1429192258

So GOOG could roughly double their salaries and remain profitable.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  If Google disburses that $14B Net Income as salary/bonus to the employees, the Net Income would be $0.   One can&#x27;t have it both ways, unless you illogically count that money twice.<p>Besides the issue of recategorizing &quot;net income&quot; as &quot;employee expense&quot;, Google wouldn&#x27;t have new money to invest in the business <i>as an ongoing concern</i>.   That $14B can be used in future years to invest in driverless cars, satellites, global internet hot air balloons, acquisitions of other companies, or whatever ambitious plans they have.<p>Disbursing the Net Income to their employees means Google would cease to exist as a viable ongoing business.<p>One can also look backward and see why and how companies get formed in the first place. If angel investors and venture capitalists <i>knew from the beginning</i> that Google was going to disburse all Net Income to employees, they would have never invested $$$ in 1998 to let them grow.  Angels and VC&#x27;s are not charities and they want ROI -- because things like pension funds that utilize VC&#x27;s want an ROI.<p>From that birth of the company, the chain of events continued:  a big reason why Google has $14B of net income in 2014 is that they <i>did not disburse the net incomes to employees</i> in previous years 2013, 2012, 2011...2000.

This will mainly be in the form of a priest^WCEO which will travel to the other startups to &#x27;wololo&#x27; Engineers and DataScientists so that they work for him.<p>Another interesting option will be, the &quot;secret agent&quot;, a guy (Eng, DS or Admin) who you can disguise as a unit from another player and leave in the middle of the enemy&#x27;s Plex so that he believes that it is one of his units. Once the enemy player starts directing your &#x27;camouflaged&#x27; unit you will be able to get new information about the adversaries.<p>Should make an interesting game haha.",1429190537

Map your random numbers to the set [0,1,2,3] divide by 4 and you also get a uniformly distributed number in [0,1).<p>With my method we&#x27;d pick the magical constant 16777216.0f and we&#x27;d also get 0, 1, 2, ... 16777216.0f is bigger than 8388608f, therefore it&#x27;s better.<p>This [1,2)-1.0 method has 0 probability of picking the first number less than 1.0, 2^-52 probability to pick the next one, 0 probability to pick the next one, 2^-52 probability of picking the next one, etc. My algorithm has 2^-53 probability of picking the first number less than 1.0, 2^-53 probability of picking the next one, etc. Down to .5 I can pick every representable number. After that there is a choice. I chose to have the same probability of picking every smaller number (including 0.0) as the probability of picking numbers in the upper half of the range, so I have holes that I can&#x27;t pick, but at least in the upper half of the range I can pick every number I can represent.<p>That&#x27;s why I think that [1,2)-1.0 is flawed. Because it adds an arbitrary limitation to its output, without any good reasons except that it was convenient to implement and they didn&#x27;t have to think hard.",1429189699

I think the canonical approach (as in, the one mbostock was thinking of, although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made explicit anywhere, possibly deliberately) would be to have the linkStrength be fixed and the linkDistance be a function of the closeness of the connections (which I just referred to as &quot;link strength&quot; in my head, ugghh.) possibly with a correcting factor to accommodate for the size of the screen.<p>On a side note, this is one of the major troubles we&#x27;ve had with d3, in that a lot of it was obviously made with a particular use case in mind, but built to be much more flexible/powerful than necessary for that use case, which is the great strength of the library, but means that whilst the documentation of the api is extremely thorough, the documentation of the natural ways to use it tends to be done exclusively by example, which doesn&#x27;t quite convey the understanding that lies behind it.<p>Ref:

If you read the entire post, he clearly says that he uses a dual environment of Windows/Linux. He uses Visual Studio which is certainly one of the best IDEs and right now, it only works on windows. So it is not like he is <i>only</i> using windows but he is using what works best for him. He also uses Vim as he clearly explained. Isn&#x27;t that the point for developers that they use the tools they are most comfortable with ?<p>I am not a Windows fanboy of course. I know Linux works really well for dev environments but if you prefer to use an IDE for development and not just a simple editor, then I would argue that it is hard to beat Visual Studio. Sure you can program even in notepad. Again, a choice. CLI is not always the answer. But then again, Windows does have Powershell which has evolved well.<p>I will give you one example. If you are building ASP.NET MVC applications, you really don&#x27;t have a better choice than Windows as you can integrate it really well within Visual Studio, link with Git and pretty much do everything within VS including deployment.

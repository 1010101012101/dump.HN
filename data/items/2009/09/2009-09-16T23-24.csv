From the perspective of the driver or victim, it's easy to say 100% car company -- again because the risk flowed through the car company, which had the expertise and commercial duty to sell a safe product.<p>But between the car company and the original feature developers it depends on their arrangement. If the developers are an outside firm that sold the system as fit for a particular purpose, much or all of the blame then flows to them. If the developers are the car company's in-house employees, the company probably agreed to take on the blame along with the profits, as the company is the coordinator and tester/seller of a multi-person process that failed.<p>For Q3, again it could vary and be a matter of perspective. From the perspective of the customer, it's 100% the shop, which has taken on responsibility for the benefits and costs generated by its employees in the performance of their duties. (From the customer's perspective, the barista and the shop are one and the same.) For the shop owner, responsibility may be thought to lie with the barista, especially if the rate of mistakes goes beyond typical/achievable levels. Still, as a practical matter of employee morale and labor law, a policy where the barista pays the costs of occasional errors is unlikely. The remedy for excessive errors is change of employees, not compensation for individual mistakes.",1253145481

827076,comment,827076,826956,0,0,qeorge,,,"Thanks jacquesm. I'm somewhat familiar with PCI standards, and your answer is what I suspected. However, it doesn't totally answer my question, because confirmation screens are quite common. Even meeting PCI Level 1 compliance, and thus being allowed to store the acct #, cardholder name, and expiration date, its still not kosher to store the CVV2 number or track data, so how are others pulling this off?<p>I know some gateways will run cards without the CVV2 #, but the fees are usually higher. Is the answer then that order confirmation screens and sending CVV2 data are mutually exclusive to all merchants, regardless of their bankroll?<p>Edit: <i>Unless you are planning on being an IPSP you should not attempt to either receive or store CC info.</i><p>This seems a bit extreme. Are you saying no one should build any sort of on-site payment processing into their own site?<p>We build a lot of e-commerce sites for clients, and our standard MO has been to send the data to the gateway immediately and never store it. With SSL and PCI Level 4 compliance, this hasn't been a problem. In this particular case, a desire for a confirmation page was voiced and we at first sought to examine whether or not this would require Level 1 compliance. Upon digging deeper, I'm now of the opinion that its not possible, even with Level 1 compliance, yet I see this in the wild all the time. What gives?",1253144651

I'm working on an open-source project called GarlicSim (http://garlicsim.com), which is a Pythonic framework for working with simulations.

Consider Haskell. As a language, it's not doing too badly. Why? Well, one reason is that it is very well designed. But another is Hugs. Hugs was available a decade ago, it ran anywhere, was lightweight, let you use your favorite editor, implemented almost the complete standard, let you write and run Haskell code easily immediately after installation (which was fast), and, while it's a bit short on tools, it does let you write and run ""real"" programs.<p>I would say that Lisp desperately needs a Hugs.<p>If I look into getting a Lisp implementation, I see that they want me to learn Emacs, or mess with the JVM, or are not available on all platforms, etc. None of these things have much to do with the language itself, and they are all barriers to adoption.<p>I just want to click a box in my package manager, hit the button to download, run the program, and be in a REPL, or maybe say ""edit"" (or whatever) and be typing in a source file, which I can easily compile and execute.<p>Again, Lisp needs a Hugs.

827016,comment,826304,826462,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is quite true, and I didn't put my point across very well - I apologize for all the hand-waving and sweeping statements.<p>I see porn as a bit different from other content in 3 ways: 1) it's smutty, so it's not worth much of the industry's time/money to serve DMCA takedowns or RIAA-type lawsuits, since they're unlikely to gain much public or legislative sympathy; 2) distribution is very fragmented - 80 distributors serving approx. 8000 adult stores in the US; and 3) branding is relatively weak, due to the factors above. These differences put a lot of pressure on content providers and limit their growth potential (quiet there at the back).<p>The reason I think this matters, in the context of the OP, is that with such a fragmented market it's difficult to identify serious long-term investment opportunities. I think the most successful adult product in the last year or two was some 'male enhancement' pill marketed on cable TV, which isn't content-related at all. For porn media, the market is like thousands of independent or small-chain bookstores that sell fanfiction-quality-dreck right alongside premium offerings, creating an inexorable trend towards lowest-common-denominator content. since advertising opportunites are limited (porn mags and websites) providers have to produce a constant amount of relatively low-profit material, rather than being able to follow a more traditional launch & cash-in cycle like movies or pre-internet porn where the barriers to market participation were higher.<p>tl;dr the unique distribution challenges in the porn industry significantly limit profit margins compare dot other media. All IMHO.",1253142283

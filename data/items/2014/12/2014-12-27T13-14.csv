A lot of code optimization assumptions from prior CPUs went out the window with that microarchitecture.</i><p>I&#x27;d say the P6-NetBurst change was the biggest, and in many ways it was also a failure specifically because of its <i>extremely</i> different performance characteristics; it was far more &quot;RISCier&quot; than its predecessors or successors, and instruction sequences that were fast on the P6 became much slower (e.g. shifts). The long pipeline made branch penalties increase. It tried to compensate with high clock frequency, but that didn&#x27;t always work. Existing software had to be recompiled to get much improvement (and compilers updated accordingly), something that a lot of people just didn&#x27;t want to/couldn&#x27;t do, for various reasons. Fortunately the change to P6-based Core brought back with it the more predictable performance characteristics of the P6, and its successors have been more incremental improvements on that than a radical new direction.<p><i>it will often buy 2x performance improvement overall versus well designed generic code tacitly optimized for another microarchitecture</i><p>2x is a big gap, but it&#x27;s still quite small compared to the 5-10x (or more) between NetBurst and P6 on the same code.",1419687927

What&#x27;s happened in Chicago has many parallels with public housing projects in (some) European countries. There was a boom in large scale public housing developments in many European countries in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of these housing developments were large monolitic blocks. Some random examples:<p>- Droixhe in Liege, Belgium <a href=""http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Vue_de_Droixhe.Jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Vue_de_Droixhe.Jpg</a>.<p>- The Aylesbury estate in London: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aylesbury_Estate_View.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aylesbury_Estate_View.jpg</a>.<p>- Chêne Pointu in the Parisian suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/noobax/6188995903/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flickr.com/photos/noobax/6188995903/</a><p>Many public housing developments were not stitched into the fabric of the city, but set apart from surrounding towns or city centres. The architects who built these blocks had the best of intentions (although some also had strong ideological views that influenced their designs). But today, we recognise that this style of overscaled, monolitic block design was a mistake. In the UK, the era of large scale mass public housing was largely over by the 1970s, but their effects linger on today in our attitudes to public housing and housing development.<p>Despite the run-down nature of many estates, strong social ties developed among residents. When estates are marked for regeneration, those ties are often broken as people are re-housed and dispersed. What does community even mean nowadays in cities when housing is snapped up by absentee investors and buy-to-let landlords with no interest in their neighbours or the neigbourhood?",1419686854

A few important numbers come to mind.<p>- do you get more operations tickets right after a production deployment?<p>- do your call centers get an increased calls/hour rate after a production deployment?<p>- are there often noticeable anomalies in system resource usage that seem to be directly related to your deployment cycle?<p>- do your monitoring tools show a higher rate of warnings/criticals right after a production deployment?<p>Whether or not production deployments introduce more risk is probably largely subjective. How well do you test, what number of changes are inside a deployment, how collaborative are your operations/development teams, are your technical teams understaffed, and so on.<p>The advantages of a freeze (defined as &quot;no production deployments during a certain time window&quot;) that I see, are at least the following.<p>- from my own experience while working in operations, I remember very well the many sleepless nights that somehow always seemed to be the immediate consequence of new (byte)code running in production<p>- it gives operations a break; they often work at ungodly hours the whole year, and getting some rest is very much needed<p>- it gives a moment to stand still and reflect; work on internal tooling, putting some structure into ad hoc things that sneaked in, etcetera.<p>Furthermore, I don&#x27;t agree with the philosophy that &quot;everything is always broken&quot;. Sure: disks and power supplies break all the time, even load balancers break, security patches need to be applied, and so on. But these are things that are part of day to day operations, and most operations engineers know how to do them. It&#x27;s usually controllable. Unlike a bug in some newly introduced code by one developer that causes a stack overflow every time one certain application flow is being hit. That requires a different kind of discipline to solve.<p>I think it&#x27;s a little dangerous to generalize these things without having actual numbers to back them up; before you know it, your operations team won&#x27;t have any excuse to just sit and play Quake for a week.

There are many Minecraftian games, but none have really reached the success of Minecraft (even though many clones generated millions), and you have to ask why that is.  There are many theories, but mine is that:<p>A) Minecraft&#x27;s success was a self-fulfilling prophecy (the more successful it was, the more news it generated, and thus the more sales it drove). This is not to say, at all, that any of its success was not well-deserved.<p>B) It appealed to the younger generation in a (say, ages 4 to 14) in a way that many people are still failing to grasp.  A huge amount of marketing revolved around user-made Youtube videos.  I don&#x27;t think I can do this, but still it is interesting to analyze. It was immediately accessible but showed its potential for further development which is why it was so successful in pioneering the early access model.<p>C) Markus Persson is a likeable guy, and an entertaining read on Twitter.  He created a culture around Minecraft. He is also genuine - he really takes part in the indie community, cares about what people say, and actively develops even though he no longer needs to. Another part of this is because he has befriended and surrounded himself with other interesting people, and curates interesting content.  He has almost 2 million followers at this point, including the vast majority of the gaming press, so single tweets can have powerful effects.",1419686586

8802426,comment,8784104,8786979,0,0,tripzilch,,,"The main reason I&#x27;ve been holding off getting a dog or a cat (current preference is cat, but that has and could change again), is that I&#x27;d have to clean, handle and take care of disposing their faeces[0].<p>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m grossed out by the idea--not at all, I&#x27;m not very squicky when it comes to this matter. But it&#x27;s the <i>principle</i> of it. It&#x27;s probably also a rather silly idea, so bear with me for a bit :)<p>The idea is most illustrative with dogs, I&#x27;ll argue it can be extended to cats later. When you have a dog, you&#x27;re supposed to be its boss, right? This is healthy for the dog because it&#x27;s a pack animal (unlike a cat), it&#x27;ll behave better and feel more comfortable if it has a stable place in the social hierarchy, etc. But humans, primates are social animals too. And <i>as it so happens</i>, one common way of signalling social pecking order among primates is flinging poop at each other.<p>Now of course modern humans don&#x27;t (usually) do this any more.<p>And I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m over-thinking this. Which is what modern humans (can) do, unlike other primates (I think).<p>But the brain circuitry for this social pecking order pack hierarchy behaviour are still there. And I have an idea of this sad and confused primate ghost functioning somewhere in the back of my primitive brain circuits, wondering why it&#x27;s handling the poop of another pack member that is clearly so very much of lower status than itself.<p>And that is why this idea (silly as it may be) would also extend to cats, even if <i>they</i> are not pack animals, the human cleaning their poop still is. Maybe even more strongly so, as dogs clearly display their relative social status to their bosses in a variety of other ways, while cats are usually lovingly described by their owners as having their very individualistic, charmingly alien, ideas on the matter of status.<p>So I don&#x27;t know anything about pets or cats or dogs. I expect you to tell me this :) And I suppose my opinion on these matters will change quite a bit if/when I ever adopt one.<p>Still, having a robot (or robot toilet) take care of my cat&#x27;s droppings would pretty much solve the whole débâcle. And yeah I can imagine how it could be &quot;life-changing&quot; in a similar manner as getting a dishwasher machine would be (given one does a lot of home cooking). I do wonder what a similar robot for dogs would look like, though. Because if it would walk your dog for you that&#x27;s taking away part of the bonding and fun of having a dog in the first place. So maybe you&#x27;d just have to walk both your dog and POOPBOT 9000 at the same time, or something. The three of us could even play fetch together, maybe.<p>[0] I&#x27;m sure there are similar rules in the US but to be clear, in the Netherlands you are required by law to scoop your dogs droppings as you walk it outside. As a non dog-owner, and judging what the few exempt areas[1] look like, I&#x27;m quite happy with this rule.<p>[1] Quick bit of side-info about spatial planning in the Netherlands, contrasting with (say) the US or Germany: There exists <i>no</i> empty space in the Netherlands. None. Not between roads, plots of land, fields/plains/forests/nature, industry sites, anywhere. It&#x27;s all accounted for, zoned and planned down to the square metre. Land is very expensive, and even the trimmings are zoned as &quot;rest space&quot; so they can be tracked.",1419685340

8802422,comment,8801678,8801995,0,0,DanBC,,,"But the exposure must be controlled, otherwise the person suffering risks making the problem worse.<p>Consider the example of Bob, a hypothetical person who has a phobia of elevators.<p>People tell Bob to face his fears.  So, Bob decides to do this. He visits a local mall that has a bank of elevators.  As he approaches them his body starts releasing adrenaline.  His palms get a bit sweaty.  His heart starts pumping a bit faster.  His breathing changes.  His anxiety levels raise.  Bob tells himself to just keep going.  He reaches the elevators, and reaches out a shaky hand, and pushes the button.  He has thoughts - &quot;I&#x27;m going to get trapped in this elevator&quot; (for example), but he pushes those thoughts aside.  The elevator arrives, with the announcement &quot;Ding!&quot;, the doors slide open, and Bob gets in. Bob&#x27;s thought&#x27;s are crowding his mind, but he thinks &quot;This is stupid, my fears are irrational&quot; - but that does nothing to stop his fear. He pushes a button for a floor a few levels higher.  The doors slide close.  The elevator starts with a small lurch.  Bob&#x27;s anxiety levels are now really high.  He is near panic.  The elevator reaches his selected floor, the doors open, and Bob rushes out.  As he leaves the source of danger his body floods with endorphins, and the further away he gets from the elevator the better he feels.  His breathing calms down; his thoughts subside; his heart rate drops back to normal.<p>Bob has not conquered his fear of elevators.  Bob has made his fear worse.<p>What Bob should do -- and these might seem like minor changes -- is to add some time for him to consider his thoughts.<p>Bob should spend a few moments looking at the elevator.  Bob is in control - he can get in or not, as he wishes.  He has to think about what his emotion is (&#x27;Fear&#x27;) and what the thought causing that emotion is (&#x27;I will be trapped in the elevator&#x27;).  He should sit with that for a few moments.  Bob is not supposed to think &quot;my fears are irrational&quot;. People do after all occasionally get trapped in elevators.  (And spiders can be dangerous, and dogs do bite people, and sometimes blood does carry diseases, etc etc.) He should consider the evidence for that fear - (&#x27;I read that report of someone who got trapped in an elevator for a few days&#x27;).  He should also think about how his body feels, and recognise that his heart rate has risen, and his breathing is different.  Then he needs to think about different evidence (&quot;I don&#x27;t know anyone who has been trapped in an elevator.  I have never heard of these elevators not working.&quot; and see whether that has reduced his fear a bit.  This is an iterative process, you&#x27;re supposed to use it each time you face that situation and it gets easier to do over time.  Once Bob gets into the elevator he is supposed to stay in it until he has controlled his breathing and reduced his fear a bit.<p>So, yes, it&#x27;s important to not avoid all sources of trauma but it&#x27;s important to do it properly.<p>Trigger warnings do serve a useful purpose when talking about suicide or self-injury, which both have elements of contagion.<p>EDIT: Your article starts with an example about OCD.  I agree that trigger warnings don&#x27;t help there, and what people actually need is much easier better quicker access to treatment.  There is very little risk of someone with OCD doing the things they have obsessive thoughts of (women have thoughts of putting their babies in microwave ovens, for example, but they would never actually do this).  The article&#x27;s expert then only considers trigger warnings for trauma - (where I agree they serve little purpose) but does not consider trigger warnings for contagion of self-harm or suicidal ideation.",1419685246

If this man values Klingon, he ought to be able to teach his kid the language.<p>2. Using your own assumptions, you can make similar arguments for teaching ""lesser"" languages like Spanish or Chinese in an English speaking environment. I think that is a dangerous and scary proposition.<p>3. Most children are able to pick up the english language outside of the household (ie. every single 2nd generation immigrant from a non-english speaking country).",1258613655

People liked it, but enough also wanted passwords that we added them soon thereafter.  The real takeaways were:<p>*  Give before getting - we let you use the service before we ask for your email.
*  Make logging in via email simple. ie- Someone in your family posts a photo, you click on the link and you're logged in.

Then they sue the farmers for not paying the license fees. They threaten to not supply farmers with GMO seed if they use normal seed for their other crops.<p>Similarly they attempt to patent strains that have existed for centuries in order to become sole providers. See the Basmati / Texmati rice case for just one example <a href=""http://www.no-patents-on-seeds.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=74&Itemid=42"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.no-patents-on-seeds.org/index.php?option=com_cont...</a><p>They have made every effort to remove other options from the farmers and are creating monopolies through questionable business practices and IP abuse.<p>It's a dirty business all around and it's a clear indication that the patent system is broken. Commodities are cheap, <i>because they are commodities</i>. Simply because anyone can jump on in and have a go at producing them. That's the free market at work, cheap and lots of it.<p>Contrast commodities with the protected patented good. Expensive and a limited supply typically, since you can only get it from the IP owner or a licensee. Why innovate if you don't have to and if you do, make sure it's patentable and stretch it out.<p>If patents were fair and equitable all around then people would not be trying so hard to turn commodities <i>back into</i> patented goods.<p>It's not tenable and it is the cause of our current economic malaise. It's a high tech world and the path to economic growth is blocked because as soon as you computerize or mechanize, you run into a wall of intellectual property that you can't get around without gobs of money for lawyers.<p>The software startup world was the wide open frontier ten years ago, a place where you could make money with just an idea, but it's gradually getting the life choked out of it by IP law.<p>Sorry, I did not initially mean for this to become a patent rant, but it is connected to everything I have been thinking about for the last year or so and it's really pissing me off how far it's tentacles go.",1258612242

According to the graph, ~6% of women are considered very attractive (5) and receive ~18% of the messages. ~15% of the women are considered pretty attractive (4) and receive ~28% of the messages.

If the teacher isn't even grading the work, then what is the point? If the teacher is giving the kids more work then he/she could possibly grade, then there is a disconnect somewhere that is to the children's detriment. If a kid is supposed to be writing 5 pages per week, and none of it is getting corrections from the teacher, then what is the child learning?

949837,comment,947740,948268,0,0,Dove,,,"> Because we're adapted to it and we're messing with systems that are not well understood.<p>Well, at least we try to understand them.  Nature doesn't even do that.  Bananas--in any form--are new; a 10,000 year old irreproducible hybrid.  Corn and cattle have undergone extreme selection and no small amount of random variation in that time.  Nature produces viruses and parasites and mutations on proteins and poisons, none of which have us in mind.  And it does it much, much faster than human evolution is going to be able to adapt to changing available food sources.  Our generations are long, and little things like cancer at the end of life just don't hurt our offspring that much.<p>In a contest between engineered food -- whether cloned or GM -- and food that's just been genetically drifting for a few thousand years, I'll take the engineered food every time.  Sure, the engineers are working with systems far beyond their ken.  I get that.  But nature wouldn't be shy about doing even relatively obviously dangerous things.  Engineers might make sweeter apples and we discover many years down the road that some protein interaction upsets some delicate balance if you eat them with too many fish and it causes your teeth to turn blue.  But nature might decide to make an apple all cyanide and not just the seeds.<p>Humans are pretty robust and adaptable.  We can handle the random, arbitrary garbage nature throws at us.  We wouldn't be here if we couldn't.  So I'm sure the mistakes of a few engineers who trying very hard not to hurt us won't amount to much of anything.",1258611682

949831,comment,949610,949610,0,0,mdemare,,,"The only evidence that the author gives for the proposition that reading code is key to writing good code, is indirectly, by analogy to the arts. But music, painting and poetry are completely different subjects. There may be similarities between (say) poetry and code, but it is absurd to say that, since reading poetry is important for poets, reading code must be important to coders.<p>And there are plenty of reasons to believe otherwise. For one, extensively reading code is rare among coders. All good poets are very well-read in poetry, but there are many good programmers who rarely read code other than what they intend to modify, or as documentation.<p>Also, unlike a poem, a unit of code (say, a function) has a very well-defined goal. Coders don't need to develop an elaborate aesthetic sensitivity to judge whether their work passes their goals - unit tests and benchmarks will do just fine.<p>Nor do coders need to read code in order to learn about clever coding techniques. Partly, this is because code, unlike poetry, contains very few clever things per line. Partly, because there are simply better ways to get such information: books, blogs, articles, HN, proggit, stackoverflow, and so on.<p>It may well be that reading code is very helpful in becoming a better programmer.

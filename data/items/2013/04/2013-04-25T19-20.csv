Similarly the rectangle with tuples. I'm only guessing on this one but I suspect if you change it to vectors then<p><pre><code>    a = Vector(1, 2, 3, 4)
    b = Vector(3, 4, 5, 6)
    c = mul(a, b);
</code></pre>
Is far more understandable than<p><pre><code>    a = Vector(1, 2, 3, 4)
    b = Vector(3, 4, 5, 6)
    c = mul(a.x, a.y, a.z, a.w, b.x, b.y, b.z, b.w);
</code></pre>
And that the more complex the math the worse it would get. Even for rectangles a larger example that did various intersections and unions I suspect the results would change.",1366919988

Any team (of 3) that has a single member fail will be failed as a group. If any ninja gets caught cheating they will be given a warning, and after three warnings they will be failed.<p><i>SPOILER (no really, the episode is great in this context even if you don't like/watch anime much)</i> 
The intelligent (but not book-smart) notice the leniency of the anti-cheating-system and the carefully worded instructions to ""not get caught"", and then find ways to obtain answers from ""sources"", qualified chuunin who were intentionally planted in the exam hall who knew the answers, or to collaborate with teammates.

If it's too easy for them to find answers without rigid rules, it probably means that he problems we are posing them are not hard or thought-provoking enough in the first place.<p>Edited for a missed phrase",1366919919

Not every company will follow the same approach, but the fundamental concept of net present value is very common.<p>Once you have a good understanding of the basics then you can delve further into derivatives. It would be hard to get into derivatives without a solid background in what a MBA/graduate level corporate finance book gives you.<p>As an aside, anyone in IT that wants to expand their business know-how would gain quite a bit by reading a corporate finance book.

5609460,comment,5605690,5607835,1,0,nostrademons,,,"Interesting.  The anthropological and psychological definitions aren't really at odds with each other.  When you face primarily external disapproval, it's natural to feel ""I <i>am</i> bad"", because people's outside opinions are not something you can control.  When you face internal disapproval, the natural response is ""I <i>did something</i> bad"", because you know your own reasoning, you have control over it, and you can resolve to do better next time.  Same basic principle as ""growth mindset vs. fixed mindset"". [1]<p>I'd argue that if devs shame each other all the time, something about your culture is broken.  Why?  Because the normal response to shame is to want to hide it.  You see that in the description of shame vs. guilt societies in the links you provided, where ""Shame cultures are typically based on the concepts of pride and honour, and appearances are what counts, as opposed to individual conscience in guilt cultures.""  Shame is positively correlated with depression, addiction, violence, aggression, bullying, and all sorts of other nasty stuff; guilt is inversely correlated with all of them.

Much as I respect the people associated with Copyheart (Nina Paley, who I think created this whole Copyheart thing, is the ""artist in residence"" at QuestionCopyright.org), I find the way some people try to basically just pretend copyright doesn't exist as a way to fight against the problems it creates somewhat naive and/or irresponsible.  If you want to make your works available freely to others in the same spirit as the Copyheart thing, feel free to slap a Copyheart message on it, but please add a simple, clean, copyfree license on it (such as the COIL, Open Works License, or WTFPL) on the thing as well.<p>The reason to do that is not for your benefit so much as it is for the work's benefit and that of the recipient.  A vague, hand-wavy statement like the Copyheart message can expose people who copy, share, and possibly modify your works to legal difficulties down the road.  Consider, for example, what happens if you get hit by a bus tomorrow and a week later your heirs start sending DMCA takedown notices to people circulating remixes or modifications of your work, even if those remixes are respectful, adhere to the spirit of your efforts, and give all due credit to you as the creator.  Chances are very good that any attempts to fight such takedowns would not stand up well in court if the Copyheart message is all that you offered as ""protection"" for the people spreading your work to new fans.<p>Please, do the responsible thing.  Use a simple license that is very clear and complete in its intent, such as the COIL, Open Works License, or WTFPL -- or pick anything from the list of Copyfree Initiative certified licenses that suits your fancy, I suppose:  <a href=""http://copyfree.org/licenses"" rel=""nofollow"">http://copyfree.org/licenses</a>",1366919409

You could substitute ""too complex"" with ""too big"".<p>Feature wise I'd say Rust has more in common with a functional language.<p><pre><code>  * Consistent type system. (base types like int are objects)
  * Emphasis on type safety.
  * First class functions and Lambdas.
  * Pattern matching.
  * All memory is somehow managed or owned. (#1)
  * Isolated concurrent memory. (No need for semaphores/mutexes)
  * 'variables' are immutable by default.
  * Types with traits instead of a ""class"" system. (#2)
  * No exception catching (#3)
  * Generics (#4)
  * No direct null/nil (Options are used instead.)
  * Concurrency is built in.
  * Can allocate on the stack, or via a managed 'box' on the heap. (#5)
  * Has the ability to link to and call C code.
  * Has the ability to break out into inline assembly.
  * Macros. (#6)

The manual is reasonably decent: <a href=""http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/rust.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/rust.html</a><p>#1) Technically you can break out into unsafe memory operations or assembly. You have to specifically mark your code as 'unsafe' when doing so however.<p>#2) Similar to Haskell type classes and way simpler then C++ classes.<p>#3) There is a kind of error/exception but they are way simpler and not meant to be managed like in C++/Java<p>#4) Don't confuse generics with C++ templates. (C++ templates can be used for the same purpose, but is WAY more complex and interesting.)<p>#5) Perhaps the most complex part of the language... Boxes are a bit like smart pointers but with way less code involved.<p>#6) I have not gotten into this very deeply yet but it looks more like Lisp macros instead of C/C++ macros/preprocessing.<p>For perspective... C++ has about 84 keywords. Go has 25 keywords plus several predeclared identifiers (true and false for example). Rust currently has 32 keywords.

It seems like a much more challenging task to get right. If you want to avoid repetitiveness at the scale of Skyrim I'd guess you would need reusable assets on the scale of pieces of a tapestry, and creating unique dungeon layouts would be extremely difficult, as they need to be designed to hold the attention of the player.

Back at Christmas I bought the first season of a show, and after enjoying the first few episodes, I put season 2 on my Amazon wish list, which I basically use as a convenient bookmarking tool. At the time, both box sets were about the same price, and it was roughly the going rate for such things. A few weeks later, I'd finished the first season and went to order the second, credit card literally in hand, and found that they had basically <i>doubled</i> the price since I bookmarked it. There was no obvious justification, so I assume it was their automated pricing doing something funny. In any case, I immediately removed it from my wish list; I enjoyed the show, but not that much. Last week, I went back to take another look in case the price had come down again, but no, season 2 is still way more than season 1 and other comparable products. The following day, I learned that a TV channel I get is showing both seasons back to back, so if I just wait a few days I can have the whole thing for free. Score: Me 1, Amazon 0.<p>It's not as if this is the first time I've seen their pricing do silly (from a customer's point of view) things, or the first time they've annoyed me for that reason, but it's the first time it was so silly that I just walked away from a purchase without hesitation, and in this case clearly I'll never go back now. I've heard similar anecdotes from enough friends now to realise that I'm hardly alone, either.<p>This leads me to wonder whether all of this computerising and optimising that they are doing will backfire at some point, and a lot of the advantages they seemed to have in better pricing compared to bricks and mortar stores were actually temporary or illusory.",1366918790

Programming languages are line-based and are more akin to recipes or poetry. So that's a bad analogy. Unless you consistently write all your statements on a single line, of course.<p>Furthermore, you present a false dichotomy here. A semicolon-free language can easily have semicolons as an optional measure if you <i>do</i> want to cram several statements together on the same line. You mention one-liners; a semicolon-free language can support semicolons. Here's a Ruby one-liner:<p><pre><code>    >> b = Box.find(3); t = Thing.new; b.add_thing(t)
</code></pre>
A class of errors: Well, anecdotally, I have personally never had a single issue with semicolons in JavaScript in all my years developing with it, simply because I always use semicolons. The reason is that JavaScript has a bunch of ""semicolon insertion"" rules that are not well understood, so dropping the semicolons is a bad idea, as the recent ""fiasco"" showed, and I just decided very early on not to go that route.<p>As I understand it, JS is a semicolon-enforced language that allows you to drop them at your convenience, whereas Ruby, for example, is a semicolon-free language that allows you to include them at your convenience. I'm not a parser expert, and I won't swear there is a significant difference except in which rules are defined. But I do know that semicolons are categorically not an issue in Ruby. So I would say that this argument is invalid, too, because it presents a flawed language as the ideal. The Rust guys should not need to base their design on JavaScript.",1366918463

Chances are the caller before you was kind of a jerk, and the caller after you will probably be kind of a jerk, so if you approach the call in a nice manner and are polite and patient you'll stick out in a good way and the agent will be more inspired to assist you.

Experienced programmers were more likely to incorrectly assume that the results of earlier calculations would be used in a later calculation.<p>2: ""counting"". All participants, regardless of experience, were more likely to assume that a statement separated by vertical whitespace was outside of a loop, when it was actually still inside the loop. (Note that the programming language is Python, which doesn't have a loop termination token.)<p>3: ""funcall"". Whitespace between operators (e.g., 3+4+5 vs. 3 + 4 + 5) had no effect.<p>4: ""initvar"". No interesting result. (This one seems to have been mis-designed.)<p>5: ""order"". Respondents were slower when functions were defined in a different order than they were used. Experienced programmers didn't slow down as much.<p>6: ""overload"". Experienced programmers were more likely to be slower when faced with a ""+"" operator used for both string concatenation (""5"" + ""6"") and addition (5 + 6), rather than used for just concatenation.<p>7: ""partition"". There was a result, but I don't think we can draw meaningful conclusions from it.<p>8: ""rectangle"". Calculating the area of a rectangle using a function that took tuples (e.g., ""area(xy_1, xy_2)"") took longer for programmers to understand than a function that took scalars (e.g., ""area(x1, y1, x2, y2)""). Calculating the area using a class (e.g., ""rect = Rectangle(0, 0, 10, 10); print rect.area()"" took the same amount of time as using scalars, despite being a longer program.<p>9: ""scope"". No conclusive result.<p>10: ""whitespace"". Using horizontal whitespace to line up similar statements had no effect on response time. (There was another result relating to order of operations that deserves further study, but it wasn't thoroughly tested here, so I don't think it's conclusive.)<p>Note that all programs were exceedingly simple (the longest was 24 lines), so be cautious applying these conclusions to real-world work.",1366917890

It doesn't always (or, to be honest, almost never) works out of the box, but it's very easy to tweak.<p>Anyways, as for the way you're handling relationships:<p>The RESTAdapter works like it does because it expects hasMany<->belongsTo relationships. In that relationship:<p>- It can load the child record from an array of IDs on the parent.<p>- When a child record is updated, it is saved back to the server without including the parent.<p>- When a child record is added, it only saves itself back to the server. The <i>server</i> is expected to handle adding that record to the parent resource.<p>- Similarly, when a child record is deleted, it is saved back to the server and the <i>server</i> should remove it from the parent resource.<p>Essentially, the client shouldn't need to save the list of children back to the server.<p>The downside of this is that this doesn't actually work in a hasMany<->hasMany relationship, because a record in that relationship <i>does</i> need to send back the list of resources - it's the same as the way a belongsTo record will include its parent.<p>Regardless, there's no obvious harm in overriding RESTAdapter to do this, and it shouldn't impact the way that a regular hasMany<->belongsTo relationship is handled. Just make sure that the client-side records always have a current representation of their relationships, or you might end up saving back incorrect versions of the records.",1366917308

5609216,comment,5604598,5608358,1,0,graycat,,,"On your first point, it's super simple:  My point is 
that any student who goes to a well known US college
or university is having most of their education paid
for by US citizens via gifts and/or taxes.  So, when
a foreign student gets such a US education, it was
mostly paid for by US citizens.  Simple.<p>Why is this important?  Because US citizens are
hurting, and (1) the foreign students are taking
educations paid for by US citizens when the children
of those US citizens are struggling to pay their
part of such an education and (2) the foreign students
who stay in the US then are job market competition for
US citizens.  Did I mention that US citizens are 
hurting?<p>The people pushing for foreign students to come to the
US are powerful in the US economy and want the foreign
students as STEM graduates for cheap labor.  A related
point is often another goal to create an identifiable
lower class for STEM fields where US citizens of 
Western European descent are not welcome.  I.e., one goal is to create STEM fields as a lower 'caste'.  The people
pushing worked through the NSF and the H1B program and
various immigration rules.  But these people pushing
were not the tax payers Joe and Mary or usually
the wealthy giving gifts.  That is, the US has
a university system paid for by US citizens, and
some powerful people in the US have partly 
hijacked that system to their own ends of flooding
the US labor market in STEM fields.<p>For some years, a major result was that good
US students looked at graduate study in STEM
fields, saw something wrong, turned, walked
out, and went to professional school instead --
law, medicine, business, maybe even agriculture.
That's partly how the US got so many lawyers
and MBAs.  So, some of these guys got an
undergraduate major in a STEM field, looked
around, 'got wise', and jumped out for 
law, medicine, etc.<p>Second, for a citation, get the annual reports of
several well known colleges and universities and
see where the money comes from.  You will see that
my statement that a student pays for about 1/3rd of the
total is correct.  In some cases, a student pays
nothing -- as I recall, Rice long had that policy.
At the wealthy schools, no one is turned away due
to inability to pay.  That is, the school decides
whom to accept and then provides financial aid
as needed.  For the four year liberal arts college
I went to, the students paid only about 1/3rd.<p>Go look it up.<p>Or I'll put it to you this way:  Suppose you want
to start a college or university.  So, you have
no gifts, endowment, or tax money.  ""Tax money""?
Sure, all the state colleges and universities 
are heavily supported by state taxes, e.g., in 
NY, CA, MD, the Big Ten, Arizona, Florida, Tennessee,
Kentucky, Texas, Arkansas, Washington state, 
Georgia, e.g., for Georgia Tech, Alabama, 
Mississippi, MA, etc.  So, you are going to fund your 
institution with just tuition.<p>But you still have to hire professors, 
erect buildings, set up a library,
have fountains, athletic facilities,
a student union, a concert hall, 
a string quartet series, a student
health center, computing, administration,
etc.  And you have to compete for good
students.  So, Harvard has maybe $18 
billion in endowment and lots of gifts
and the buildings already in place.
Ohio State has a campus in place and is
heavily supported by tax money from
citizens of Ohio and still has gifts.
E.g., they have the Fisher School of
Business.  Why?  No doubt some guy
Fisher made a big gift.  So how will you
compete?  Answer:  You won't.  So,
you don't.  So, there are no such
US institutions.  Clear enough?<p>I can believe that most foreign students
in US colleges and universities had to
struggle financially to get through and
guessed that they were paying for all their
education and maybe also leaving a profit
for the school.  But the truth is, they
were not paying for all their education;
a larger part was being paid for by US
citizens.<p>So, why have US institutions long welcomed
foreign students?  Well, the institutions
want to see themselves as helping the
world, civilization.  They don't see
themselves as just creating proprietary,
protected 'intellectual property' for
the US.  But did I mention, US citizens
are hurting.  China, South Korea, 
Singapore, etc. are booming.  Some
parts of India are getting going, 
e.g., in steel, autos, electric power,
and more.  Pakistan is doing well 
exporting textiles, very similar to
what used to be made in the Carolinas
in the US.  A lot of this foreign
growth has been seriously helped by 
the US opening its markets and 
making its educations available to
the world.  So, now the real unemployment
rate in the US is about 20%, and 
US citizens in STEM fields are hurting.<p>I'll end with a personal story:  I'm 
starting a business.  Why?  One
reason is, I am absolutely, positively,
permanently unemployable at anything
above minimum wage.  And I have been
since I was about 45.  And I have
an excellent background in STEM
fields:  Math SAT over 750 twice.
Math GRE 800.  BS with Honors in
Mathematics.  Also nearly a second
major, in physics.  Master's in
Mathematical Sciences.  Ph.D. in
Engineering, really some applied
math.  Career in applied math
and computing for business and
US national security.  The applied
math and computing saved FedEx
twice, saved it from going out
of business, literally.  I've
published in high quality 
journals in applied math,
computer science, and artificial
intelligence.  I've been a professor
in one of the better MBA programs.
I've taught computer science
at two well known universities.
Still, since age 45 or so, I've
been totally unemployable.  I'm
healthy, never been arrested or
charged with any violation of law
beyond minor traffic violations,
etc.  Totally unemployable.
Why?  A major reason is that 
too many of the STEM jobs went to
people in an identifiable,
exploited lower class via
the actions of the NSF and the
H1B program.  But, I still have
a good background in pure and
applied math, a lot in science,
engineering, computing, technology,
(right, all four STEM fields), and
business.  Did I mention I'm
100% unemployable?<p>When I got to 45, it was finally
about time to buy a house.  
Couldn't afford it.  So, never
bought a house.  My wife died
after a long illness, and I wanted
to get married again; couldn't
afford it; didn't do it.  I'll
spare you the rest of the details.<p>And I know fantastically talented,
beautifully trained Ph.D. pure and
applied mathematician US citizens with great
backgrounds in computing and business
who are in the same situation.<p>So, when I hear that the US has
a shortage of expert STEM labor,
I know that I'm hearing a flim-flam,
fraud scam.<p>Uh, for a comparison, early in my
career, the company I was working
for messed up, and I went looking
for a job.  In two weeks I sent
some resume copies, went on seven
interviews, and got five offers,
all at more than I had been making.
My wife was pursuing her Ph.D.,
and we were saving money rapidly.
Really, it was such career successes
that started the H1B program and
the NSF interventions.  Again,
once STEM labor is about ready to
buy a house, the powers that be
get scared and act to destroy the
careers of US citizens in STEM
fields.<p>For me this fight is just ancient
history:  If my business works, then
I will do well.<p>But I would not recommend that anyone
try to have a career as an employee
in a STEM field in the US because that
field has a 'managed' labor supply,
managed in a clumsy way that too easily
can destroy careers.<p>Some immigrants to the US have figured
this out:  I know two guys from Turkey.
One is terrific at hardware computer
architecture, e.g., VLIW.  The other
started a plant nursery.  The guy with
the nursery is doing better.  Why?
The plant nursery business is not
of interest to the H1B or NSF 
manipulations.<p>My business makes heavy use of computing,
and there is some crucial core 'secret
sauce' that makes crucial use of my 
Ph.D. and research abilities.  But
that is rare, so rare the US 
information technology venture capital
community has no idea how to 
take it.  Okay by me.  It appears
I can bootstrap my business, and 
venture capital will be slow to
fund competitors.  And nearly
no one with my math background
wants to do an information technology
startup.<p>Still, if go into a STEM field, 
f'get about a career as a non-academic
salaried employee.<p>Government actions tend to be clumsy,
and often destroy what they seek to
help.  Well, the H1B and NSF efforts
have essentially destroyed STEM 
careers in the US.  Instead, start
a lawn mowing service, a plant nursery,
a red sauce Italian restaurant, etc.",1366916997

If the crying and not sleeping doesn't stop soon, it could be attributable to an allergy or food sensitivity. Your wife can either go on a super bland and shitty elimination diet, or you could talk to your doctor and see if formula exists for super allergic kids and just try him on that for a few weeks and see if it gets better. Food allergies are really common nowadays, and it's an easy thing to fix.",1366916888

It's just a thing that I've concluded as a result of my own experiences with selling digital media (games and music).  Piracy did indeed spread awareness of my music and game, although it's hard to say if caused any lost revenue.<p>I supposed some fraction of pirates would have instead paid for the media had they not been able to pirate it, but there would also be a fraction of paying customers who would not have heard about the media had their peers not pirated it.  It's hard to tell if these two populations are roughly equal in size, but I have a hunch that the second group is larger.  This is based on our sales data following our involvement in the Humble Bundle: <a href=""http://hitboxteam.com/dustforce-sales-figures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hitboxteam.com/dustforce-sales-figures</a><p>If you look at the third chart, you can see that after the Humble Bundle spikes, the blue line starts to have an upward slope, whereas it was almost flat before.  This indicates that sales on Steam increased after the Bundle finished, due to the huge influx of new players (many who only paid a penny).  It seems that the more people playing the game, the more copies you will sell, because more awareness is raised.  There are a lot of factors involved in that that don't let me conclusively say that this effect extends to pirates too, but it seems reasonable.  Since I can't do anything about piracy, I don't let it bother me too much and just focus on making things worth buying.  It's just a part of the business, so it's factored into it all.",1366916720

5609189,comment,5608984,5608984,16,0,enraged_camel,,,"<i>Getting back to the topic at hand, we should also acknowledge the most self-evident drawback of using modular art: the fact that resused art can become repetitive.  This leads to what we commonly refer to as art fatigue.  The median play time of Skyrim on Steam has peaked at well over 100 hours, which is a huge compliment .  With that kind of time spent, however, players are bound to notice the same rock or farmhouse or tapestry used again and again.  And another two dozen times after.  Art fatigue sets in where this repetition becomes obvious and erodes the authenticity of the world.</i><p>It wasn't art fatigue that annoyed me. I don't care about seeing the same tapestry or window over and over.<p>What annoyed me was that after playing for ~10 hours, I started to recognize the entirety of sections (chunks) of levels that were reused. When you're in a cave, and the cave takes a turn to the right and immediately descends down to a rock bridge over a stream - <i>just like the ten caves before it</i> - it kills replayability. For a game that is supposed to reward exploration, designing levels in that manner seems like an odd design choice. It's probably why I played for ~40 hours and then gave up before even finishing the game.<p>I understand the challenges of scope and the need to find an efficient system to design the world and its levels. But they should have gone with a level randomization similar to Diablo 2. That game also reused art assets, but levels never became repetitive because, except for very specific parts, they were truly random all the time.",1366916674

The blog post was meant to give an overview of what today's social apps have in common, and how things could and should be done better. You'll hear a lot more about it in the coming weeks.<p>The list there is just an overview of what sets our platform apart from everything else out there, and what makes our team excited to work on it for the past 2 years. We believe we're making a difference. And the size of our user base lets us really test if we're right, and iterate until we hit our goals.<p>If you want to learn more about our business strategy and what our long term roadmap looks like, get in touch with us, or follow us. We are not yet at the stage where we are inviting other developers to build on our platform. We are building it out for ourselves and our users.<p>That said, you're correct. These are valid concerns and you can only learn about these kinds of things as the platform gets opened up and policies get put in place. Pay attention to the incentive structure of the platforms you are building on, and you will have answers as valid as ones the platform developers themselves can tell you. The short and simplistic answer to your question is that, IF everything goes as we plan, in a few years this will be a completely decentralized social network (think Wordpress of social networks), that does right by its users and developers.",1366916634

Customer Service isn't something a profit driven company <i>wants</i> to do, its something they <i>have</i> to do to retain users. The idea of talking to a person seems enough for some people as they can vent their frustration at a CSR but I never felt that was good enough; when I did it it felt criminal.<p>But then you have companies that go out of their way to help you. They have the power to bend the rules and when its in your favor it can be an extremely rewarding experience as a customer. I'll always toot Valve's horn because of this. I placed an order and paid extra not to have DHL shipping to Canada (I've had too many bad experiences to count). Valve shipped it DHL anyway so I emailed customer service explaining my displeasure. They asked that I refuse the package when it arrives and they'll have the order correctly shipped with UPS as I instructed.<p>Not only did they ship my UPS order <i>before</i> the DHL had arrived and been subsequently rejected, they refunded my entire purchase.

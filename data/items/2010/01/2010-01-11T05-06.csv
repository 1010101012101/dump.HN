The original title was ""Selling Drugs for Fun and Profit"" (a phrase he actually uses early in the book) because he ran a nutritional supplement company.  I think the story is a retailer balked at the title, so he ran his test, and picked the winner.<p>Anyway, people seem to get hung up on that aspect of the book, but it's really about much more than that.",1263189501

You state conservationists argue resources are ""mispriced due to uncaptured externalities, and that this leads to overuse"" (or misuse).  How do you suppose these conservationists aim to correct these ""externalities""?<p>Obviously they attempt to do more than point out an item is mispriced.  Otherwise, their best course of action would be to buy resource XYZ as it's pure arbitrage in which case it is a bet against our ability to innovate and adapt.<p>edit: I notice you've modified a significant portion of your response and added a disclosure.  I tend to agree that the grid will get smarter and we will become more energy agnostic.  That merely goes back to proving the point that the markets themselves create the incentives for resources allocation - ie innovate and adapt and for this reason it has been historically foolish to bet that we will run out of a given resource.",1263186708

Take toilet paper for example, you see a lot of marketing for toilet paper, but I seriously doubt the total market size for toilet paper is really being increased dramatically via marketing.<p>No, the advertising isn't meant to make people wipe their asses more, it's to <i>steal market share from competitors</i>. Consumption in this case has not risen, only redirected to another producer.<p>So no, not all advertising aims to increase the desire to consume <i>in general</i>, it simply increases the desire to consume <i>a particular product</i>, very possibly at the expense of other consumption.<p>Furthermore, there is substitutability of goods - if Bob's Toilet Paper works as well as Joe's Toilet Paper, and costs 30% less, consumers are <i>reducing overall consumption</i> (by dollar value) thanks to Bob's shrewd marketing. Not all advertising results in a net loss for the consumer.<p>It is patently false to claim that all marketing acts explicitly against the interest of those it advertises to.",1263186300

The smaller labor pool also decreased the value of labor.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we should return to that at all, but I do think we should be looking at this (like most things) from a quality-of-life perspective.

Coding tests are a fairly standard thing (good or bad) and they may have had their reasons for switching up the timing - would give Crytek the benefit of the doubt there.<p>However as someone who has been on the other end of those calls I am saddened that you were treated to such an unprofessional and disgusting display.  When you contacted HR to reschedule did you mention how the interviewers treated you with such disdain?  I would hope that their HR and legal departments take such behaviour very seriously (and HR probably have no idea what happened).<p>Personally I would take this experience as a bad sign for this particular application and not pursue the job any further (would you want to risk dealing with that every day).

He&#x27;s out there topless, swimming in a Siberian lake. He&#x27;s out there on a tiger hunt. He&#x27;s out there flying with cranes. He&#x27;s out there dressed as an ice hockey player. He&#x27;s out there doing judo moves. He&#x27;s tough on terrorists. He&#x27;s tough on breakaway republics. He stands up to &quot;the Great Satan&quot; (sorry, actually that&#x27;s a line used by Iranian wackos). Etc.<p>This cult of personality takes many years, even decades to develop. Also these types of leaders hate up-and-coming competition. So there&#x27;s no JV Putin out there, building up his own cult of personality.

8744442,comment,8744153,8744328,0,0,olefoo,,,">  Why does changing (fixing) these things take so damn long?<p>Because:<p>a. Established interests profit from the current arrangement or worry that their interests will be compromised if things chang.<p>b. Our system is set up to resist rapid precipitous radical change.<p>c. Changing institutions takes a long time and requires much political will, or at least alignment with social forces in play.<p>d. Change has costs; even if the existing system is wasteful, dysfunctional and cruelly indifferent to the pain it causes to some subset of the people in contact with an institution. The costs of changing that institution are unknown and unknowable and the argument against from fear of the unknown will always have weight with decisionmakers.<p>e. Institutional change always has winners and losers, and often the ones with the most to lose are close to but not at; the top of the hierarchy.<p>That&#x27;s the short version. The long version involves quantitative social science and figuring out which nodes of the power network have the capability to drive change and which must be routed around to effect change and which ones are likely to be obstacles to change. Modeling the political economy of even a small institution is a considerable effort; and since it&#x27;s hard to get people to precisely quantify their biases and predilections even if they are cooperative; a large amount of it is guesswork or inference from extremely thin sources ( like trying to divine someones political allegiances based on the corpus of emails that are sent to internal mailing lists ).<p>And since Psychohistory is bunk, there is no plausible way to predict second or third order effects ( the response to the response to the change you are trying to achieve if it were successful ).<p>There are only a few organizations that have the mathematical ability, computational power and access to significant communications between decision makers to even attempt to do this at scale. In fact I can only think of one that could attempt to do so at a global scale; and it&#x27;s a TLA whose initials start with N, end with A, and have an S in the middle.

The first is that he comes across as stunningly <i>tone deaf</i> in this circumstance;  unless I am reading pure calumny, it seems that he did not consider what a corrosive effect a jargon-heavy, non-committal communication style would have when dealing with people who were deeply, professionally engaged with the <i>meaning</i> of words.

Buffer overflows are a very real concern, especially in embedded software; but that doesn&#x27;t mean that people don&#x27;t ever use pointers. Everything about software has risks. Yes, they probably shouldn&#x27;t have used recursion there in that car; but honestly, it&#x27;s just a stack. Enough calls and some state could have been frozen. They should have put mitigations in place to stop the potential for a stack overflow to have actual, detrimental results. Do you refuse to ever make a function call for fear that you might be at the top of the stack somehow? After all, how can you know that you haven&#x27;t accidentally created a state machine with function calls and are at the peak of it now, and end up causing the same problem. Recursion may have been the final manifestation, but it&#x27;s certainly not the only place that failed.<p>I argue against your thought that recursion is useless, as well. It&#x27;s a natural and intuitive solution for a lot of problems. The very concept of a dynamic programming solution starts with a recurrence relationship. It starts with recursion. Sorting algorithms are intutively recursive in many cases, Quicksort and Mergesort are just two examples.<p>And, &#x27;dangerous&#x27; is an interesting term. I understand you&#x27;ve worked in embedded systems and hardware, and so those things are often critical systems that have to be super secure and completely bug free.

I don&#x27;t see that changing soon.<p>Investing in a JS framework seems like a natural complement to your existing skills. Angular & Ember are great fits with Rails. I also like Knockout, which has an easier learning curve.<p>Another great fit would be Chef, which would leverage your Ruby skills and let you improve how you&#x27;re deploying the Rails apps you&#x27;re building.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a lot of experience in low-level languages, I&#x27;d explore those for the learning. C is a lot of fun and very different than Ruby. iOS would be a practical choice, and apps make very rewarding side projects, although it might be a big change of focus for you.

Reading this, you are left with an impression exactly opposite reality:<p>&quot;Since Kerry Devine, 32, and her friends began having children, she has noticed a stark difference between her female friends in Auburn, Wash., where she lives, and those in England and Cyprus, where she grew up. In the United States, they almost all stopped working outside the home, at least until their children were in school. Yet, she says, she can’t think of a friend in Europe who left work after her children were born.&quot;<p>First of all, let&#x27;s remember that men are also leaving the workforce, and the decline of men in the workforce is a much older trend than women leaving the workforce:<p><a href=""https://familyinequality.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/wlfp1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://familyinequality.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/wlfp1.j...</a><p>As to Europe, please see here:<p><a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS</a><p>Let&#x27;s start with overall female participation rates in the workforce:<p>France: 51%<p>Germany: 54%<p>United Kingdom: 56%<p>USA:57%<p>By this measure, the USA rate seems a little elevated, but not dramatically so.<p>Europe is catching up, but has not yet caught up:<p><a href=""http://www.thefinancialist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/female-europe-participation2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefinancialist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/fe...</a><p>A few Scandinavian countries exceed the USA rate, but most of Europe lags behind:<p><a href=""https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/images/women/General/Women_in_Australia/2009/fig3_1.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/images/women/Gene...</a><p>But what about mothers with kids? There the reality is the opposite of the one suggested by the quoted paragraph. Women with kids are more likely to work in the USA than in Europe. Look at the high rates of women with kids in the USA in this graph:<p><a href=""http://www1.eeoc.gov/eeoc/meetings/archive/4-17-07/boushey.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.eeoc.gov/eeoc/meetings/archive/4-17-07/boushey.h...</a><p>It is true the peak of the trend was many years ago, but the numbers are still high. The USA has a very high level of single moms, much more so than in Europe, and most of these women need to work, so the number of women with kids working will probably remain elevated in the USA.<p>Figure 1 shows that in Germany the rate remains below the USA level until the children are 10 years old:<p><a href=""http://www.public.asu.edu/~abick/bick_childcare.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.public.asu.edu/~abick/bick_childcare.pdf</a><p>This is the pattern in most of Europe: as children get older, the percent of mothers who work approaches USA rates, but if we talk about mothers of young children, the USA has the highest participation rates in the world. Again, this is driven by single moms, and the lack of welfare benefits in the USA, compared to the richer social safety nets in Europe.<p>This article offers some insights about the USA:<p><a href=""http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2012/us-working-mothers-with-children.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2012/us-working-mot...</a><p>&quot;In recent years, more mothers of young children have entered the paid labor force. While the share of mothers with children under age 6 in the labor force has risen sharply, the rate for all working-age adults has remained relatively flat. The recent economic recession, the steady decline in men&#x27;s real earnings, the growth in single-mother families, and the increase in women&#x27;s educational levels are some of the factors likely contributing to the growth in the proportion of mothers of young children in the workforce.&quot;<p>Also here, scroll way down to the graphs:<p><a href=""http://www.frdb.org/upload/file/paper_delboca.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frdb.org/upload/file/paper_delboca.pdf</a><p>Again, you can see that the Scandinavian countries are ahead of the USA with both fertility and women working, thanks to more supportive policies for women, but most European countries are behind the USA rates.",1418451672

8744364,comment,8738869,8738869,0,0,noisy_boy,,,"The first use case that came to my mind has been the one I&#x27;ve had difficulty with for the longest - marking/unmarking my music files to sync with my Android phone. I&#x27;ve heard Rhythmbox is good for that but what I&#x27;m looking for is a window which shows all my music with those that are also on my phone marked somehow (maybe a differently colored icon or something like that). I should be able to right click or use a shortcut to mark/unmark the music and once done, the music on my phone is updated. Files previously present and now unmarked are deleted, files newly marked are copied.<p>I can see using TMSU for this with following approach:<p>1. Mount the VFS, to e.g. mount point &quot;mp&quot;<p>2. Using Nemo Actions (I use Linux Mint), call a script that upon executing on the selected file will do the following:<p>- toggles the &quot;sync&quot; tag (so all files with &quot;sync&quot; will show-up under &quot;mp/tags/sync&quot;)<p>- If the file already has a &quot;sync&quot; tag, untag it (can it be done by doing an rm on &quot;mp/tags/sync/<filename>&quot;?)<p>- Based on tag being present or not, toggle file icon to visually indicate if the file is marked/unmarked. I don&#x27;t know how this can be done.<p>3. Once done, we can run a simple rsync script that syncs &quot;mp/tags/sync/*&quot; to the sdcard on the phone.<p>Not sure when I will get around to actually implenting this :)",1418450633

I meant straight-up collision with a modified length.<p>The known MD5 collision attack needs to modify the length of the message; finding a collision with the same length is extremely difficult. It would be reasonable to assume that attacks on other hashing algorithms would suffer the same constraint.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t having the length specified in the integrity attribute help reduce chances of a future attack? The cost of specifying the length is negligible; about 12 bytes for a base-64 encoded 64-bit unsigned int.",1418450617

3425614,comment,3425331,3425331,4,0,deltaqueue,,,"I suspect FogCreek had success because their sales team is relatively small, but I'm curious to see how this works long-term. Is a lack of commission structure going to deter future recruits? They said nobody left, but have they tried hiring any additional sales reps? Big time sales reps will assuredly balk at the prospect of cutting their income to some average amount, but perhaps that type of employee only exists at larger organizations.<p>As a sales engineer, I'm not sure I agree that employee views can be divided into a black-and-white categorization of X vs Y. I'm not lazy, want to avoid work, etc., and yet I still think a $200,000 deal requires more work and yields more profit for the company than a $5,000 deal, and thus I should be rewarded for that additional effort.<p>Comparing this reward system to coding or some other profit-generating segment of the company only works part of the time. With sales, the increased profits available for reward are immediately clear. With coding, the value-add of a coder's efforts are less clear, so it's up to his or her manager to see the financial impact of that employee and reward accordingly via bonus. Simple example: a friend of mine optimized some javascript, reduced the file size, and this ultimately saved his company over $200,000 a year in bandwidth. This is quite clear, whereas a simple bug fix or new feature is not.",1325707071

3425603,comment,3407436,3411478,1,0,tempire,,,"The difference we have here is that I don't think it's anti-discrimination laws that change society.  It's communication and confrontation of evil that changes society, and that happens over time.<p>Anti-discrimination laws didn't pop out of nowhere; the idea had been building over time, and when they hit the courts, new laws where made, instead of addressing the issues with the laws that were already made.<p>You argue that the status quo remains unless something is done - I agree, however that something is not law.  There's a word for forcing morality on people: bigotry.<p>Allowing black people to use public roads is a matter of upholding existing law: All people are created equal.  It took a lot of time, but eventually America began to understand the inconsistency of that law - A law that wasn't forced on people, but rather one that people chose to support when they supported the revolution.  Change didn't happen by law.  The change happened by people no longer standing for it.<p>The fact is, whether the group of people is gay, black, or whatever, there will always be a people group that is being discriminated against by someone.  20 years from now, we'll be coming up with more laws about group x, and pundits will say, ""This is just like the gay rights wars of the early 21st century - we need more laws!"", just as much as gay rights pundits are making comparisons to mid-20th century race relations, and demanding more laws to address an issue that people are already changing.<p>The point is this: laws don't change people.  You can't enforce morality on people.  Enforcement only creates bitterness and more problems.  Change happens because of cultural influence, and that cultural influence is the input to the change function, not the output of f(law).<p>Your last point is that state-recognized marriages get tax benefits, but that's an issue with the tax code, not marriage.  Attempting to fix the problem by defining/redefining marriage is like spraying air freshener without flushing the toilet.  The problem is the tax code, not marriage.  If you remove the concept of a marriage license, there are no tax benefits, for anyone, no matter their sexuality.  The state simply has no jurisdiction over marriage.  It's an inherently personal matter.  Subsequently, Ron Paul's removal of the IRS also addresses the larger problem.<p>This is why I keep touting ""freedom freedom freedom"", because that's the core principle from which the solution is grown.  Get the government out of the way, so that people, together, can work out problems.  Enforcing morality by law encourages segregation.  Staying out of it, thereby forcing people to deal with themselves and others without running to mommy government...that's the long term solution.<p>Freedom solves all problems.

We borrowed his brother's vehicle. His brother is a SWAT team member. My friend left the FOB in his pocket and it fell out, given up to the river gods. His brother had the vehicle rigged against hot wired jump starts. Clever fellow.<p>It was at that moment, and not an instant before, that we started paying attention to ""Lock Smith For Hire"" and ""Jump Start Service"" signs. The first guy to pick his phone up was hired.<p>The guy who came to jump us took an hour to show up, was an ass and didn't really quote us a price or listen to our description of the problem - but heck if he didn't have that car running 5 minutes later.<p>Point is, when you are down to the felt unexpectedly, you'll take the first option you can get and will judge the service in binary - it did or didn't solve your problem. If I was going to have to go the half mile to BK, but now I don't, that's good customer service.<p>Ever used a bail bond company to get someone out of jail? Someone had peed on the only unoccupied seat. There were still 4 customers in line ahead of me. I doubt the guys across the street offered much better. They didn't really need to.<p>You can't advertise in the paper ""need help filling out your visa?"" and expect a good return. You can't give out free drinks with your return and expect to drive repeats. Your whole business is being a printer at the right place at the right time.<p>Yes, if one guy wants 3 visas over his life time (they expire, he travels often, etc) then perhaps you can make 'em loyal and garner repeat business. That seems a small-ish portion due to the type of business.<p>Yes, if there are 10 vans out there and yours offers a free drink with the service, you will get more business until all your competitors copy your offer - then you'll all be giving away that margin, and probably paying a guy to make sure your new offers are more attractive than the other van's offers besides.<p>You won't drive repeat business by being super nice or wearing matching getups due to the type of business, in my humble opinion. If you are in many other types of businesses this make a lot of sense and should be focused on, but saying ""customer service wins every time"" seems like an over reach.<p>To me, a better investment would be great signage/advertising dominance/figuring out who owns that land and buying it/paying who ever owns that land to disallow other vans from parking there/etc.",1325706540

For each user, you generate a private key and keep it on the server. <i>But,</i> you encrypt that private key with their password, and you don't keep that password or anything derived from it anywhere.<p>To log in, the server sends the encrypted private key and an authentication challenge to the client. The client then uses the password to decrypt the private key and respond to the challenge. Replay doesn't work, since the response is only good for that challenge. Watching the traffic on the server doesn't work, since you can only get the encrypted private key and the response. Snarfing the contents of the database doesn't even help, since you only get the encrypted private key.<p>For bonus points, I don't know if this is actually possible, make it so that it's impossible to tell whether a particular decryption of the private key is valid without using it to respond to an authentication challenge and sending that response to the server. This way it's impossible to brute-force the encrypted key, substantially mitigating problems with weak passwords.<p>Of course, I may have missed something obvious here....",1325706385

For example I think most good software comes from people who go to bed a little concerned about issues with their code or product features. On the more grand scale, when Michael Jackson released Thriller, the first album I believe to outsell the Beatles, all those around him thought his next album should be just a simple collection of covers so he could take a break, but he was determined to out do it, dissatisfied with his current success (which would seem absurd even to most HNers, you just outsold the Beatles, you can give yourself a pat on the back)<p>Success is the balance of  dissatisfaction with your own work combined with a drive to push forward.  The drive without the dissatisfaction just leads to a bunch of mediocre half done projects, the dissatisfaction without the drive will just end in depression.<p>I think truly great people are nearly torn apart by these clashing drives, but that's what leads to true masterpieces.<p>On a personal note I think it's important to find the level of dissatisfaction that works best for you. It my be great to make Thriller, but paradoxically if you're the person that makes Thriller you won't be able to accept its greatness.  At the same time you never want to be in a state of comfort such that your life is spent playing xbox all day.  Of course some (Buddhists being one group) would argue that true happiness is elimination of both the drive and the dissatisfaction, they may be right but I'm too driven in my personal work to follow that path ;)",1325705302

These estimates are generally in the $1bn to $1.5bn range (edit: per year), and usually on the lower end of that range, since ~2008.<p>Which definitely does not put any given WoW year at the top of grossing movies (but still in a healthy position, 10 movies so far have gone beyond a billion gross). Still I think a fairer comparison would be to movie franchises, if we put WoW's total revenue around 5~6bn it would rank #2 behind the Harry Potter franchise ($7.7bn) and before James Bond ($5.1bn).<p>However, I think it's fair to say WoW is an anomaly in terms of revenue.

He wrote: ""For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald. ... Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war. Their own anti-Semitism has caused this vast crime to bounce off their consciousness.""

He applied it to the game Trillion Credit Squadron and won two years in a row with fleets the other participants scoffed at. The first year he/Eurisko won by creating a largely stationary fleet that could take enough damage to survive long enough to destroy its opponent. It exploited a damage rule in the competition. The damaged party got to select which component/subsystem was damaged. Eurisko constructed a fleet with many small, useless components which could be individually destroyed without impacting the effectiveness of the crafts themselves.<p>Edit: Reading more about it apparently the primary advantage was the shear number of craft.

This can cause issues if the observing method needs to update the GUI. In this case, you'd need to use GCD to make sure the contents of the listening method execute on main thread (or alternatively, make sure the object's property is updated on the main thread).",1325703613

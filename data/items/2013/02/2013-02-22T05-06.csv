You don't need the whole project to be rebuilt. As far as I am aware, this is what makes Play unique. The 'hot' reloading is probably the reason why it's useful to show nicely formatted errors in the browser (during dev / debug mode), you can see immediately where you stuffed up soon after browser refresh. Errors are also pushed to the console.<p>However, I realise that ASP.Net MVC View templates can be updated during debugging session, I only wish to be able to do the same with the .Net classes without having to rebuild it.<p>Plus, being on the JVM you'll have plenty of PaaS deployment options for cloud hosting provider (e.g. Google App Engine, Heroku, OpenShift).",1361512787

It just has to keep people happy and make the transition to a fully web-based future happen smoothly.

We built a marketplace for open-source projects, trying to add a business layer around open-source development, so that developers could work on it full time, and provide the level of support that people require.<p>Proprietary software companies like to point out that while FOSS might be free in distribution, the lack of support means that you pay for it in other ways - and to some extent that's very true. Very few open-source projects get to the point where they can sustain themselves while still giving out their main product for free.<p>I think developers should be able to sustain themselves working on open-source projects, even with relatively small adoption and scope, by treating it like a business. If you don't want to support it - give it for free, if you want to take it to the next level, start charging for distribution.

I have premature twins that were born last January three months early (they are doing great now, BTW).  While they were in the hospital, family came and visited sporadically.  One of our parents (I'll be vague) was with us in the hospital when my wife and I were mistakenly told by doctor that our son had potentially severe brain damage (IMMEDIATE PARENTHETICAL NOTE: he did not and is doing great, they misread the MRI).  So, my wife and I are pretty alarmed and stressed.<p>The visiting parent, on the other hand, was stammering and incoherent for days afterwards, totally unable to handle it.<p>If we had been counting on him or her for emotional support, understanding, really <i>anything at all of substance</i> this meltdown would have been a problem.  But we weren't, because, you know, we've known this parent for a while now and realize and accept his or her limitations.  This response was unsurprising.<p>The point I was trying to make in my initial comment[1] is that, for some people, it is naive and dangerous to think of your parents as a ""safe harbor"" and you need to look elsewhere.  Not everyone has all of the strengths and perspective that I can only assume your parents do.  Mythologizing people as universally ""knowing more about life than you do"" because they're a little older is bullshit.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5258613"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5258613</a>",1361510492

Personally I've always looked at open source contributions as a hobby, and in the end I'm doing it in order to keep the source open and available for those who wish to learn off of it / utilize it somehow.<p>In fact I would presume that the reason people are not going to pay up front is that they assume the developer is doing it as a favor to the community, and that giving them money for it would break the philosophy of giving out of free will. The real issue though seems to be an overall lack of resources. A one man shop, even with the ability to work on their projects full time, still has a maximum output capacity. Without others to assist there is the chance they would get swarmed with bugs and feature requests leading to burn out.<p>I think that open source developers need to step back and consider the costs and benefits of their projects. Doing a large amount of projects by oneself without a good job to support on the side will lead to burnout, as we've seen here. It may feel like bestowing a great gift on the community, but if you burn out and halt all development where has that feeling of contribution gone?<p>Which begs the question of which is more valuable: financial contributions or code contributions?",1361510082

I don't see that as sustainable with a gross margin of only eight percent at twenty thousand cars a year, as that leaves a gross profit of only $120M a year at a $75K average selling price.<p>So something must be improved--either expenditures need to go down or gross margin needs to go up.  Meanwhile, the average selling prices of Teslas will go down as early adopters run dry, even as R&D and capital expenditures on other models ramp up.  At 25% gross margin, though, they can recoup their billion dollars in only three years.<p>If they're indeed flying in tires from the Czech Republic it sounds like there's a lot of low hanging fruit in the cost department, but it's quite possible Tesla has just built a more expensive car than they thought they were making.  I suspect it, in fact.  I'm not sure they'll be able to avoid going back to the public markets for more money this year if they want to expand their product line.<p>I think the interesting question is whether incumbent manufacturers will produce an equivalent auto lineup at less cost, or not.  Many competitors, like Mercedes, BMW, or Ford, have existing labor, plants and tooling they could leverage for electric vehicle manufacture.  Some have been in business for a hundred years.  If the answer is no (market is too niche, existing plants are too old, incumbents lack the skillz) I think Tesla may be a viable entity.  However, I think mainstream manufacturers have stayed away from aggressively creating new hotness in the vehicle market because they don't yet see any profits there.  Their approach has been conservative, and I think the reason is that conditions are not yet ripe.  Tesla was founded ten years ago; timing is everything.",1361509719

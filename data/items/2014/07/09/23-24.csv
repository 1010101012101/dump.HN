At least if you had chosen the largest you&#x27;d possibly have the entire box. With the smallest instance type however anyone with a larger instance than you is going to steal cycles and I/O away the second they have any load.<p>What makes people think benchmarking on virtualized hardware is at all worthwhile? (Serious question) It&#x27;s like writing a blog post about which way the wind was blowing for the last five minutes. This is all nonsense.",1404950392
8012888,comment,8011829,8012845,2,0,taliesinb,,,"Well, unlike adding and changing definitions for symbols in the symbol table, associations are actually immutable. So you can pass them around as values, mutate them, and the old versions are still available unchanged. That&#x27;s just not true of using downvalues of symbols.<p>Also, using definitions on symbols to store key-values is incredibly limiting, because you can&#x27;t do reverse lookups without getting into very low level (and slow) hackery via DownValues. Or list the keys or values. Or even know how many keys you have.<p>Associations really will replace basically all uses of symbol downvalues for storing key-value pairs. And Associations have really nice general-purpose functions like GroupBy, Counts, Merge, and so on (mentioned below).<p>Associations even support function application syntax, so you should be able to drop them in into existing code that expects symbol downvalues as you&#x27;re using them above.<p>Associations are the single most significant language-level improvement we&#x27;ve had in many versions. And we&#x27;ve integrated them really nicely across the system -- they&#x27;re not just some special-purpose data structure.",1404950372

Focusing on regaining employment would be a FAR better way to improve the situation, and it&#x27;s not even clear if the car was worth enough to pay for a decent replacement. Just because it&#x27;s a Mercedes does not mean that it magically retains its value or even that it was that expensive to begin with.<p>If they are in such a bad situation that they have to sell off their car in order to pay for some meals, then clearly they needed the support they got. Giving up personal transportation in exchange for food is not even remotely a solution to the problem. It actually makes it far more difficult to regain employment (their Honda broke down, remember?), and the cash from the car sale is only a temporary bandaid--it does nothing at all to solve the fundamental problem of &quot;income < expenses.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s beyond me how you could think that someone who is in such trouble that they have to sell off all means of personal transportation so their children don&#x27;t die of starvation would not deserve some sort of aid. In any case, the couple in this story, having regained a comfortable income, is now paying taxes every month so that if <i>you</i> face severe financial trouble you too can receive some aid without having to immediately liquidate every asset you own so your family doesn&#x27;t die, even those assets that are critical to finding a real resolution of your difficulties.",1404949657

In this impassioned talk, Ben Goldacre explains why these unreported instances of negative data are especially misleading and dangerous.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;<p>...<p>Now you might say, well, that&#x27;s an extremely unusual example, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to be guilty of the same kind of cherry-picking and selective referencing that I&#x27;m accusing other people of. But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very, very well studied. So here is one example of how you approach it. The classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where you know that they&#x27;ve been conducted and completed, and then you go and see if they&#x27;ve been published anywhere in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA. They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package. So that&#x27;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs, because we can never know if we have those, but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization. And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer-reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found. It was pretty much a 50-50 split. Half of these trials were positive, half of them were negative, in reality. But when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature, what they found was a very different picture. Only three of the negative trials were published, but all but one of the positive trials were published. Now if we just flick back and forth between those two, you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality and what doctors, patients, commissioners of health services, and academics were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature. We were misled, and this is a systematic flaw in the core of medicine.<p>8:18<p>In fact, there have been so many studies conducted on publication bias now, over a hundred, that they&#x27;ve been collected in a systematic review, published in 2010, that took every single study on publication bias that they could find. Publication bias affects every field of medicine. About half of all trials, on average, go missing in action, and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings.<p>8:45<p>This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine. If I flipped a coin 100 times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses, I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads. But that wouldn&#x27;t mean that I had a two-headed coin. That would mean that I was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it. (Laughter) But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate in the whole of evidence-based medicine. And to me, this is research misconduct. If I conducted one study and I withheld half of the data points from that one study, you would rightly accuse me, essentially, of research fraud. And yet, for some reason, if somebody conducts 10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want, we don&#x27;t consider that to be research misconduct. And when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers, academics, industry sponsors, journal editors, for some reason we find it more acceptable, but the effect on patients is damning.<p>...<p>&quot;</i>",1404948959

I can run &quot;while true&quot; on as many hosts as you want. What I&#x27;m trying to point out here is that scaling is about doing more useful work, not just using more resources.<p>Why would you need more containers on a single host? Because apps are usually <i>not</i> uniform. If you dedicate one host per service, then you need hosts to serve the maximum computation power at the peak consumption required <i>at any point in the app&#x27;s lifetime</i>. Also, VMs are heavyweight, which means that it is painful to break your app into small, independent services that you can spin up and down quickly. Containers are much better at enabling you to modularize (and thus be able to scale on a finer grain) your application.<p>Now you may argue that you can spin more AWS instances when under load. But spinning up VMs takes time, much more time than spinning up containers (we&#x27;re talking on the order of minutes vs milliseconds here). This may seem a small difference, but pair it with socket activation for instance and suddenly you go from having to carefully manage your scaling to getting it quasi-automated for free.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the ecosystem. You can create dedicate nodes/vm instances, sure. But watch a demo of CoreOS&#x27;s fleet automatically and nearly-instantly spinning up and maintaining coordinated containers [1] and you may get a feeling of why people is so excited about this whole thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://coreos.com/blog/cluster-level-container-orchestration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coreos.com/blog/cluster-level-container-orchestration...</a>",1404947687

Most of us use scripting languages, like python and perl, to automate tasks. So please, don't ask me what the difference is between a Service and a Repository class, because I have absolutely no idea. It's Chinese to me. So, programmers, stay ways from me, stay away from my environments, and stay away from my procedural python scripts.<p>Or I will replace you with a very small shell script.",1266062393

1122904,comment,1122402,1122624,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> With respect, and with gratitude for your compliments, I ask: Is there really that much of a difference?<p>I think so. ""Fucking crazy"" implies a madness/insanity/etc that can't be overcome. It's fine if you're trying to make a point and need quick words (""Wow, humans can be really fucking crazy sometimes"" in response to a story), but pointing out <i>how</i> humans are crazy also shines a light on potential solutions.<p>Saying, ""People are prone to making associations with certain words instead of concepts"" is helpful - you can think, ""Okay, then how can I use descriptive words that aren't loaded with unnecessary baggage?"" Or if you're trying to persuade, you can look for terms that are favorable. Or you can point out the error in word association. Or you can try to ""humanize"" the concept - that's my guess at what happened in this particular story. ""Homosexuals"" implies someone else - a third party, an enemy, ""not one of us"". ""Gay men and lesbians"" implies people, humans.<p>Just writing off humanity with, ""People are fucking crazy"" makes it easier for people to shrug their shoulders and say, ""Well, that's how it is."" Instead, I think it's something to be overcome. The more we point out exactly what our errors tend to be, the more we can work specifically on them.",1266059599
1122903,comment,1122409,1122487,0,0,rw140,,,"Unfortunately astrological signs didn't give me any 'opposites' I can compare myself with.  Having read through the descriptions of various character types associated with various astrological signs, I cannot say I identify with one any more than another.<p>MB-types give me a set of sliding scales.  I show up as strongly I and strongly N, which allows me to compare myself with ES types - I recognise very little of myself in ES types, and a lot more of myself in IN types, which means I'm biased towards the assumption that there is at least some basis to it.<p>I can also make predictions about what types my friends are, and (before telling them my guess) ask them what type they are.  Currently these predictions seem to be matching up pretty well, although a little fuzzy on the P/J axis.",1266059581

I think the Nexus One is the better device. There's a lot of polish missing, with too many taps required for some things, not enough finger-swipes etc., but everything else considered - especially background apps - I would not swap it with an unlocked iPhone. (And I have a fair choice of networks, being in the UK.)<p>The ability to go onto the marketplace and download e.g. a battery monitor app that could display a number on the notification bar rather than the 5-state default was refreshing. I had to jailbreak by iPod Touch to get similar functionality. I similarly had to jailbreak it to disable auto-rotation; that's a default option in the N1. And the sense of freedom in being able to e.g. download Opera and replace the browser is refreshing. This is a device that doesn't necessarily need Google to improve it - competition can play its part too.",1266059205

I guess first impressions really do matter, and of course, the first 140 chars. Still I find that silly.<p>We apparently do differ, I sure as hell don't look at things as black and white, like you do, and I am probably not a model citizen. I look at everything as a game, a game is nothing more than a system and manipulating a system is something I find very intriguing. I mean, as a kid I used to take everything around me apart, from lawn mowers to computers. I was interested in how things worked, and making them better or different was what I did for enjoyment..in the process I broke a lot of things, did many things I shouldn't have, probably pissed my dad off a few times, but in the process I learned and I find that method <i>extremely awesome</i>. It's not like I hurt anyone in the process. Honestly, if I can do all that and profit, you're damn right I am going to do it. Hell, I AM going to do it.<p>The way I see it, SEO is exactly that..and, its not like everyone else can't do the same thing. There is nothing stopping you, me or anyone else from doing what Calcanis does, except of course the ability and therefore I don't see that as a <i>bad</i> thing to do.

1122894,comment,1122777,1122777,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"As most of the comments on the post demonstrate, his demand that all software developers hate their own code more than anyone else's code is a little unreasonable. If he's been fortunate enough to always be the least competent on his team and therefore has saved himself the frustration and his co-workers only produced code which he admired, then he is definitely lucky.<p>That's not to say that most of us are great programmers -- most of us, as you might expect, are average programmers. It's just to say that there's a lot of code out there that's not even written by programmers at all. You get the designer who's been copy/pasting every snippet he could get his hands on until it just made the dumb thing work, you get construction workers and plumbers who were attracted to the glamor of a desk job after throwing out their backs, or whatever.<p>One of the last codebases I worked on was a website that ran a whole company but didn't have any ID fields anywhere and all joining or other inter-database matching had to be done by text comparison. This system was written by an ex-construction contractor who'd fallen hard on his luck, learned HTML one day, and became this company's de-facto programmer, so it makes sense that it would be like this; the concept of an ID field, after all, is not self-evident to one without training.<p>Much code out there is ""written"" by people who have no idea what they're doing. I don't mean that in the self-effacing, most-programmers-are-average-programmers way, but I mean it in the way that ""your system was built by someone who was literally just as qualified as your receptionist or janitor"" kind of way.<p>Given these circumstances, I don't think it should be an immediate writeoff if you can do better than the last codebase you were brought in to fix.",1266058857

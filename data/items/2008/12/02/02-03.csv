Mercurial's design puts most of its non-core functionality into extensions (which are easy to ignore if you don't need them), and has a clean setup for adding new extensions. How does git handle that? I haven't looked into the git source lately.<p>And regarding ""incoming"", the article says that git has a separate command (fetch) for caching server data, i.e. if there are incoming patches, when connections are available. (According to git-fetch(1), fetch looks more like pull without updating/merging locally. Unless I'm misunderstanding things, the comparison to hg's incoming is probably a bit of a stretch.)",1228186196

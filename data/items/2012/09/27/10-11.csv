I have 3G connectivity all the time, for really good prices too, both on my phone and on my iPad and I live in Romania, not the U.S. or some other country that's in the top countries when it comes to Internet connectivity.<p>And I'm seeing people living in the country-side, on farms, talking through Skype to their relatives that live abroad, using an USB stick that's connecting them through 3G, or using a broadband 50-100 Mbps connection exposed through Wifi. It's totally shocking, given that some of those places do not have access to cable TV (only through satellite) or to basic utilities such as marsh gas pipes, yet they have Internet access.<p>Of course, right now Internet access is a problem, even for us sometimes. The costs of my 3G connection is enormous when in roaming. Sometimes you lack the signal and 3G connectivity is not available everywhere, etc... but in 5 years from now I believe it will be a non-issue.<p>And Chromebook is designed for the long-run and I hope they won't cancel it in the wake of Android's success.<p>There are Chrome apps that are designed to also have functionality when offline, albeit limited. For instance there is a GMail app in the Chrome store that's designed to work in offline mode [1]. It's really basic and not something I would use, being more like a demo at this time.<p>I was also sad to hear that Google Reader is not working in offline mode anymore, so now for my iPad I'm searching for a replacement, and because what I've found in the store seems to suck, I may even code one myself - although I may just forward new items to my email address and do some filtering in my email client.<p>[1] <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ejidjjhkpiempkbhmpbfngldlkglhimk/related"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ejidjjhkpiempkbhmp...</a>",1348742865

It is also a global business with rights packaged up at a very national level and sold with exclusive deals.<p>While the biggest MSO's in each country (cable, satellite and terrestrial operators depending on the market) have the scale to lock in key content/channels to exclusive deals it will be fairly hard to break into the market in a devastating way.  At the moment they have the scale and the revenues to do exclusive deals with the content creators (that they don't already own) to keep a large proportion of their customers from leaving.  They (not the content creators/owners) are the big bullies in the market and would be hard and expensive to topple.<p>An AppleTV (including screen) if it does happen will need to be a good enough content offer for most people or it will not be a massive success.  If they still have to use their cable box it can't be a game changing user interface because you are looking at the STB interface most of the time.<p>It's not impossible for Apple but it also won't be easy, particularly to go global.  It will cost money to get content which might break Apple's principles and set a bad precedents for them.  They also can't go that expensive because while I'm sure the UI will be better Samsung/Sony and some of the others really aren't that bad and the cosmetic designs don't leave that much room for minimalist improvement.<p>The business case for Apple is far from clear for me at this point but it would be a way to take the war to Samsung that would cost Samsung far more than a billion dollars even for an Apple relative flop.  The collateral damage might kill Sharp unless they supplied the panels and would be another knife in Sony/Panasonic/Toshiba that they could do without.",1348742064

Table types are fabulous, kids!<p>And being able to take any collection of C libraries, and glue them together into 'ones own runtime' with a common language framework/boundary, means a lot.<p>So, yes, of course.. Lua isn't fast, it has weaknesses, there is luaJit and so on: its not about Lua.  Its about the fact that you can choose whatever languages are out there, get competent at their adept usage, and win.<p>I believe that Rust will be a systems programming language when there is a bootable Rust OS that boots to an editor, a shell, a means of interacting with devices, and a Rust compiler sitting there, waiting for input .. until then, it sure is fun to watch the new school language paradigms get all twisty and bent in the rush to school someone on how systems 'should be programmed, instead of the way they are now'.  Research in this field is a terrifically interesting social cache.<p>Has anyone done a RustOS?  Is there one?  I know of a couple LuaOS projects, and it sure seems to me like what was done with Linux on Android could be done to Linux, again, with Lua .. Rust .. and so on.

The brain will compensate for lower gamuts but the image will look more washed out. As an example, a color photo in on newspaper is clearly less vibrant than the same image in a glossy magazine or online.<p>Also, color accuracy and gamut are not necessarily the same thing. The typical human eye can see far wider range of colors - a wider gamut - than is possible in any display or print technology. Displays are a compromise. sRGB is far less than the human eye can see, which is why image editors use the wider ProPhoto RGB or Adobe RGB gamut (color spaces) and then after editing cleverly compress down to sRGB (or for particular applications, the exact color space of a particular printer / paper combination or of a particular display).<p>Low-gamut means some colors are missing and compressed to colors that can be shown - so the richest red becomes an orangish-red. While inaccurate, this isn't quite the same the same thing color-shifting all colors in an image, such as the yellow-cast you might see with indoor lighting, or blue-cast with outdoor shadows. All displays introduce color-shifting inaccuracies as well. High-gamut displays have a wider color pallet and are generally tuned better at the factory.<p>I expect high-gamut displays will just ""feel"" better in the same way retina / high-res displays do.<p>[edited for clarity]",1348741197

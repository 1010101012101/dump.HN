If I had a nice new leased car and my brother put a dent in it learning to drive, I'd have to deal with it.  even if it didn't jack up my insurance premiums, which it would,  dealing with a little dent is probably going to cost you at least 5 hours.   But the thing is, I don't rent;  I own a jalopy.  so the kid put a dent in it... so what?  It wasn't the first dent, and won't be the last dent.   Driving a car that is worth a weeks pay is a much lower stress experience, for me, at least, than driving a car that is half of a year's post-tax earnings.  Sure, the thing will die one of these days.   but who cares?  Push the thing to the side of the road and call a cab and a wrecker to haul it off to the junkyard.  borrow a friends car (because I'm free with loaning my jalopy, I have some credit)  or rent until I find my next jalopy.  It's been pretty good for the time I've had it.<p>Another example;  a while back I stepped on my thinkpad. Now, being a 200lb guy, the monitor cracked.  
Will insurance cover ""A fat man stepped on it?""  If they do, they'd probably pay retail to replace it (lenovo wanted $700 to fix it, and that'd be factored into premiums.)  I think I ended up paying $80 for a new LCD and spent two hours installing it.  Probably less hassle than dealing with insurance would have been.<p>Insurance is best for risks that are beyond your capability to deal with...

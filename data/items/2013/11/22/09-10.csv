We did when I was a kid.<p>The condom is something in bad need of a radical overhaul and it would have a huge effect.

Maybe they&#x27;ve really come up with something novel and non-obvious to a &#x27;person skilled in the art&#x27;.<p>Let&#x27;s check. ABSTRACT:<p><pre><code>  One embodiment of the present invention sets forth a    \n  technique for performing fast integer division using \n  commonly available arithmetic operations. The technique \n  may be implemented in a two-stage process using a single-\n  precision floating point reciprocal in conjunction with \n  integer addition and multiplication. Furthermore, the \n  technique may be fully pipelined on many conventional \n  processors for performance that is comparable to the best \n  available high-performance alternatives.\n</code></pre>\nHmm, that sounds pretty obvious.  It also sounds a lot like fairly basic arithmetic.   But it&#x27;s the claims that matter, not the abstract.<p>Here&#x27;s claim 1 in its entirety:<p><pre><code>  1. A method for performing integer division, the method comprising:\n  receiving an integer dividend and an integer divisor;\n  computing, via one or more processors, a first partial   \n  quotient using a set of significant bits from the dividend;\n  computing a first partial remainder;\n  adjusting the first partial quotient to generate an adjusted first partial quotient;\n  computing a second partial quotient based on the first partial remainder;\n  computing a second partial remainder;\n  adjusting the second partial quotient to generate an   adjusted second partial quotient; and\n  computing a quotient by adding the adjusted first partial quotient to the adjusted second partial quotient.\n</code></pre>\nHmm, that sounds a lot like they&#x27;ve just patented some fairly basic math.  Who are these patent trolls?<p><pre><code>  Owner name: NVIDIA CORPORATION, CALIFORNIA \n</code></pre>\nOh.  Well, I hope at least they make good use of their temporary monopoly for the progress of science and the arts.",1385114010

In contrast: are results tested on a plurality of machines with intentionally, measurably different hardware and the absence of discrepancies implies that the hardware is not a factor with regard to the problem being solved? Presumedly you&#x27;d need some sort of standardised test suite to pass on your hardware to really confidently declare the hardware to not be a factor.<p>I doubt this is the case, but like the previous poster, I&#x27;m quite curious as to the specific level of scrutiny applied here.",1385114005

6779974,comment,6779811,6779811,2,0,m_gloeckl,,,"I&#x27;ve had a short fling with Chrome, when it was still fairly new and Firefox suffered from severe performance issues (during the 3.6.x era).<p>Today&#x27;s picture is a little different. Sure, on JS heavy web applications and those optimized for Chrome (a few google maps based apps come to mind) Firefox gets outperformed by Chrome significantly.<p>Considering browser extensions: I still feel that Chrome extensions lack in functionality compared to their pendants on the Firefox platform. For example, I have yet to find a good mouse gestures addon that can restore a closed tab with its&#x27; history intact. I don&#x27;t blame the addon authors, that seems to be much more a problem with the API.<p>Memory usage with a lot of opened tabs is also an issue for me. On my own machine at home, I do have a lot of spare memory, but at work not so much. I&#x27;m a messy person when it comes to tabs, I leave a lot of them open and never close them, because I might need to look up something later on. Firefox is surprisingly memory-efficient (which was not always the case in the past) with a lot of open tabs, while Chrome hogs memory like crazy. On my work machine, it forces the OS to swap and the whole systems hangs frequently.<p>The last thing is customizability. If I don&#x27;t like a particular behaviour on Firefox, there&#x27;s surely a way to change it. Be it keybindings or the amount of lines I want to scroll with one tick of the mouse wheel (There&#x27;s even a possibility to set different settings for different modifier keys!), for most things there&#x27;s a setting or (thanks to the rich extension API) an addon that does the job.<p>TL;DR: Chrome might be faster for some use cases, Firefox still thakes the cake in the overall user experience discipline<p>PS: User experience and preference is subjective. Competition and choice are good and everyone gets to use the tool of their choice.",1385113928

It is like giving out Matlab for free and you think this is a bad thing? I am not saying don&#x27;t use octave or numpy scipy, but honestly students and educators can careless about whether the tool they are using is open or closed. The number 1 thing about education is not about the tool being open or closed source, it&#x27;s whether the tool is usable. Mathematica is a very well-known software and many Math teachers have used it before.<p>Seriously, they are not endorsing non-open-soruce. They are graceful that there is one additional tool available to educators. Your &quot;debian repository&quot; is a marketplace. I don&#x27;t see why education has to be run with open source tools. Why? Do we all have to use Open Office instead of MS Office suite? I actually like MS suite better but I just don&#x27;t want to purchase a license for my Mac so I keep Open Office. I like fusion over virtualbox. There is nothing wrong with anyone using closed source in education.

They report that this issue is smaller than in other studies because only health-professionals were in the study. Well at least for the economic part, there are pretty huge disparities within healthcare.<p>And then my other remark. In the appendix. Table S4: most of the confidence intervals overlap all the way from the &#x27;no nuts&#x27;-group to the &#x27;daily nuts&#x27;-group. I know you shouldn&#x27;t focus overly on those intervals. But those splines don&#x27;t look that convincing to me.<p>So considering you have a measured effect that is not that clear, where you really expect the &quot;true&quot; effect to be orders smaller than the reported 20% reduction in mortality, without proper controls in the studies for one of the largest effects (higher income >> longer life) and with lots of overlapping confidence intervals, I wouldn&#x27;t bet my nuts on this study.",1385111388

6779859,comment,6779252,6779252,13,0,oneeyedpigeon,,,"Recently, I decided to follow-up one of the many emails I receive from a company I&#x27;ve never heard of, implying I have an account with them. I usually assume they are spam, but this looked like a genuine case of someone accidentally using my email address and the service not verifying it. Long story short: via their password recovery, I now have the user&#x27;s plaintext password, and several personal details including address, age, phone number, and mother&#x27;s maiden name.<p>I emailed the company (a US mobile phone company I haven&#x27;t heard of; I&#x27;m based in the UK) and their response was along the lines of &quot;call us (at your expense) and tell us your phone number and we&#x27;ll sort it out&quot;. In the end, out of sheer frustration, I reset the account&#x27;s email address to that of the company&#x27;s WHOIS technical contact; that was the safest way I could think of getting my email address off the account.<p>Google, of course, handle this kind of thing properly.

If that was the case, following a US standard, say, should probably be as good a defence as following an EU standard. Instead, one particular proprietary standard is exempted from you having to prove anything, except for the fact that you do follow the standard. That special treatment is what is being criticized here.<p>Also, laws don&#x27;t cease to be laws because they are not consumer oriented. Your argument applied analogously essentially would mean that it would be perfectly fine for all laws concerning the taxation of corporations to be secret because those are highly technical and not consumer oriented. These dumps are not meant for consumers, but for people who are required to follow the rules set by those standards.",1385111291

SQL is text, so it can be versioned, you can back it up, and you can do it also the .sqlite file.  You can also do -HUP to reload configs, nothing about SQL or SQLite prevents that, and in fact, nginx has to completely restart its world to make this happen.  Mongrel2 will probably be able to reload without kicking over the process.<p>The problem I'm solving is one of operations automation and design.  Go take a look at the nginx code for loading configurations and then go write an nginx module.  Figuring out how to get configuration settings out of the thing is horrible.  Then, come talk to me when you can change the nginx config on 100 hosts based on the hostname and three sections of the configuration file using sed and awk.<p>Hell, let me know if you can load a random nginx config and tell me what version of nginx it works for.

You had the option to have it shipped to your door (most people did this obviously). You could go pick it up if you want but why would you do that, anyone who has paid attention to Apple releases for the past 4 years knows the lines are insanely long. Thus the shipping option.<p>Reservation: You haven't paid Apple a DIME. You simply reserved a phone. You get to show up and wait for a phone on a first come, first serve basis, but you are guaranteed to get one if you do. You know what you're getting yourself into. The long lines were a result of each activation taking anywhere from 5 - 15 minutes because of the micro-sim change.<p>Walk-Ups: You didn't pre-order and you didn't get a reservation in time. You decided to camp over night for a phone. You obviously knew exactly what you were getting yourself into.<p>As for the waiting in line experience itself: Apple extended store hours into the wee hours to fill all reserved phones. Apple paid for free drinks and free food to be handed out the entire time. I could have eaten a dozen chicken sandwiches if I had wanted them. I met a bunch of cool people while waiting, it wasn't a bad experience in any way other then the actual waiting... which I knew was the case when I got in my car to head to the Apple store.<p>Apple didn't force anyone to wait in a line.

1462144,comment,1460663,1461768,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Pay well"" is relative.  I believe they target the 75th percentile in total compensation, i.e. 25% of the time, people that receive offers from Google would receive more money by working elsewhere.  Perks are included in that, but they're pretty tiny, eg. the free food is valued at about $5k/year (it actually only costs about $2-3k/year, which is why Google does it).  That's pretty decent, particularly considering that people that receive offers from Google tend to be a small, highly-valued slice of the total programmer pool.  I make more than twice as much (including bonus + stock options) at Google than I did at my previous employer, though that's not really a fair comparison since that employer was my first job out of college and there was a startup I founded in between.<p>The other reason I say it's relative is because your market value after working for Google at a couple years is significantly more than when you joined.  After all, you made it through their hiring process, and then you've had a couple years to learn all about their search algorithms and infrastructure and data-driven culture and tons of other stuff that makes you more valuable to prospective employers.  But if you haven't gotten a promotion (and promotions can be kinda difficult at Google, because all your peers excel too), you're being paid maybe 6-7% more than when you started, barely above inflation.  So your salary - which was probably significantly above other offers when you joined - is now probably significantly under what those companies would pay you <i>now</i>.<p>Curiously, barring people that didn't fit in with the culture and left in their first 6 months, I know very few people that ever leave for another job.  Most of the coworkers I know that have left (and that I miss) went to found startups.  One is in YC WFP10.  Ex-Googler startups seem to be getting picked up a lot for $5-10M nowadays, which is of course a whole lot more than a Googler would ever make in salary.",1277499829

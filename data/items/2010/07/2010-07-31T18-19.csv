There's a big difference between finding a date and finding a friend (in the sense that the OP uses, i.e. not in the friend with benefit sense). As you point out (unfortunately, but it's a fact of life) objectively beautiful/attractive people are rare in the population and they are even more rare on dating sites. However, social interests, may be rare locally but on a national scale can be quite easy to match up. For example I like to play Go but it's rather hard to find players in my immediate friend circle and I cannot go around asking people.<p>Book clubs, chess clubs, etc. have operated in this manner for a long time, the only difference is that they substitute a physical space for a web site.<p>The real problem here is that it would be hard to create a comprehensive questionnaire that covers, say, 90% of interests and it would be even harder to find users patient enough to fill such a monstrosity.

A reason power is shifting from investors to founders is because such a team can go far enough to gain traction and profitability without requiring a cent of investment, especially if they refuse to quit and keep iterating on ideas. It seems pretty easy to connect with great hackers and designers, probably looking no further than right here at HN. However, I wonder if finding great marketers is as easy. I don't mean marketers that focus on online tactics like SEO, SEM, social media etc. Anyone involved with Internet startups will likely be okay with picking up slack in those areas. I'm talking about a different personality type. I'm talking about traditional sales -- picking up the phone and cold-calling, or pounding the pavement, just doing whatever it takes to get the sale. There is a whole world that still doesn't know any more than what they need to know, or may have heard casually, about what's happening on the Internet.

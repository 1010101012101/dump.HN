The human impact of turning of electronic devices is negligable, given there is no cellphone reception anyway. In Karoo (where most of SKA will stand, in South Africa) they indeed turned off a few radio towers for cellphones and the site is radio-free (you can only use computers in isolated containers) but it only affected a few farmers. Asking people to turn phones off in one plane is probably far more of a hassle :-)",1437127130

While I have no interest in sports its a matter of perception.<p>Now ESPN and others have sued cable operators who have tried to slice up offerings to where customers could elect to not have specific channels. So while not defending cable and satellite companies it does come to the point where its cheaper to eat the bad customer feelings than spend the money on court cases.

9901935,comment,9901282,9901895,0,0,oskarth,,,"I noticed this phenomena in my own writing and I think I know where it comes from. In Polya&#x27;s list of heuristic (from <i>How to Solve It</i>) he writes about the the two rules of teaching:<p>> The first rule of teaching is to know what you are supposed to teach. The second rule of teaching is to know a little more than what you are supposed to teach.<p>When we learn something and then write about it to teach others, oftentimes we are excited about the things we just learned, so we write about that, even if we don&#x27;t fully understand it yet. Then we add an introduction to the &quot;meat&quot; (i.e. the limits of our current understanding) which is very clear, precisely because we are &quot;overqualified&quot; to teach it. Another way to state Poyla&#x27;s rule for teaching is as follows:<p><i>Being overqualified in knowledge is a prerequisite for being qualified as a teacher of that knowledge.</i><p>One way I like to picture knowledge is as a dark room. You might step into one but that doesn&#x27;t mean you know every corner of it. For example, imagine a proof or a technique. Unless you can know by heart why each assumption is there, or when the technique fails, you don&#x27;t fully understand it. If you are guiding someone through a dark house, as you go from room to room, you are only qualified to give someone directions about the room you already been in, not the one you are in right now - even if that&#x27;s what is on your mind.<p>Note that this isn&#x27;t unique to people writing technical blogs, it happens in academia a lot too. There&#x27;s a reason Feynman&#x27;s lecture on &quot;undergraduate physics&quot; attracted the attention of graduate students.",1437126443

The future value of the sunk costs is not important -- in fact, thinking that it is important is the very definition of the fallacy. Rather, the future value of <i>all</i> costs is what is important, whether those costs are sunk or not.<p>To illustrate, here&#x27;s a simplified example. We can buy one of two Mars missions: Mars Mission A, which costs $100, of which we have already paid a $10 non-refundable deposit, and Mars Mission B, which costs $30, but we have not yet spent anything on it.<p>The $10 we have already spent absolutely <i>does</i> have future value -- $10 worth of future value, if we pursue Mars Mission A. Its future value is, however, irrelevant, because Mars Mission A has $90 worth of future costs, compared to $30 of future costs for Mars Mission B. The Sunk Costs Fallacy is to believe that the $10 continues to have any relevance in such a scenario. In truth, the future costs are the only costs which matter.",1437126238

An interpreter is far easier, but still a huge amount of work. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be fun, but I&#x27;d suggest trying a smaller/simpler project first and then revisit Ruby or JS.<p>Ruby is an absolute nightmare to parse. Both Ruby and Javascript have complex execution models that seem deceptively simple at first glance. They&#x27;re quagmire&#x27;s.<p>If you do want to do something Ruby-like, define a cut-down version. E.g. write down a grammar that covers the most important subset of Ruby that you use, and similarly define a small set of the core functionality. Parsing 80% of Ruby is easy. Chances are you&#x27;ve never used or seen most of the remaining 20% outside of rants about the complexity of the Ruby grammar. E.g. the plethora of ridiculous supported mechanisms for quoting text that allows you to do criminally unreadable stuff like &quot;% x &quot; (which, excluding the double-quotes parses as the string &quot;x&quot;, as &quot;%&quot; introduces a quoted sequence started and terminated by the character after &quot;%&quot;, except if the character is one of a set of exceptions of various kinds; this of course only when it occurs in a context when it can&#x27;t be parsed as the infix modulo operator....)<p>You can write a full compiler for a simpler language in the space it takes to just parse Ruby.<p>You could probably define a suitably small cut-down version of Ruby that&#x27;d still be fun/usable relatively easily, especially if you&#x27;re not concerned about actually being compatible.",1437125764

    lowercaser.input = splitter.left_part
    uppercaser.input = splitter.right_part
</code></pre>
This is not a judgement, just a remark. A functional solution would rather use transformation combinators to propagate a transformation on a specific value part.
For instance :<p><pre><code>    input |> map split_two_halves
          |> map_fst to_lower
          |> map_snd to_upper
</code></pre>

Since I know what&#x27;s coming I don&#x27;t feel the &#x27;panic&#x27; part of the attack anymore. I just breathe slowly, deeply and deliberately, focus on my breathing. If I get the adrenaline rush you might be familiar with, I sometimes get up and walk a bit.<p>They key for me is to recognize when I&#x27;m having or starting to have one and not focusing on it too much. I don&#x27;t know if it helped, but I used to meditate quite often. That tought me a lot about keeping my mind in check. This helps with many things, amongst which falling asleep (I just clear my mind and I&#x27;m gone in under 10 minutes) and panic attacks.",1437124018

Now there was technology you could understand: little needles and valves and levers and jets and gaskets, and if anything went wrong, you could just get a rebuild kit, tear the carb down down, clean it out, and put it back together with the new parts.<p>In fact, rebuilding the carburetor on a friend&#x27;s VW Beetle gave me the confidence I needed to take the next logical step: rebuilding her whole engine!<p>I didn&#x27;t have all the right tools, so we took the VW down to the Briarpatch Cooperative Auto Shop on Park Blvd. in Palo Alto. [1] [2]<p>This was like a TechShop for cars: You could get a membership and take your car there to work on it using their tools or your own. Or you could have one of their mechanics help you with the work.<p>I got the engine torn down, all the parts laid out on the floor, and started to think about how to clean it up and put it back together.<p>Then I realized I was in <i>way</i> over my head and called the resident mechanic over to see if he could finish it for me.<p>He did, but only after shaking his head sadly and saying, &quot;This is the <i>worst</i> way to get a job.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://ukiahcommunityblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/dave-smith-transition-clothes-and-cars-that-last-forever/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ukiahcommunityblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/dave-smi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://briarpatch.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://briarpatch.net/</a>",1437124007

Nice proof of writing secure software in C.<p>Yes, there are logical security errors that plague languages even like Ada/SPARK.<p>However in 2015 we shouldn&#x27;t be fighting against bounds errors and buffer exploits when it was already a solved problem in Algol.",1437123953

And if still your performance is so critical in that point you can use a mutable data structure which is thread safe, and separate data from code in the rest of your code having still a big chunk of functional code where it is easy to reason about.",1437123858

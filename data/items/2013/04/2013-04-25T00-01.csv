5605108,comment,5604598,5604598,4,0,graycat,,,"It's the same old, same old:  It's an
old story that somehow too many powerful
people in the US Federal Government want
to do 'US national technical manpower
management'.<p>E.g., when Sputnik went up, the Feds via
the NSF flooded US high school and college
education with money, scholarships, 
summer programs, etc. to get more US
citizens into STEM fields.<p>During the Cold War and the Space Race,
STEM students were paid nearly well
enough to buy a house; then the powers
that be got really scared.<p>But, with the stimulus, soon
the supply exceeded the demand; US
citizens who walked into a college STEM
course saw the TA and half of the students
from Asia or India, turned, and walked out.<p>So, right:  Joe and Mary paid taxes to
support public education K-college and
graduate school.  For their children
they struggled to meet college expenses.
And when their children went to college,
somehow they found lots of students 
there from India and Asia.  How come?
These students were from families with
annual incomes less than $10,000 yet
somehow got their children into the
college supported by the taxes of Joe and
Mary when Joe and Mary had to struggle
to pay for their children in that college?
Bummer.  Sure:  The students from India
and China were there on various scholarships,
indirectly paid for by Joe and Mary.  Bummer.
Ripoff.<p>During the Viet Nam war, the head of the
Selective Service system was old General
Louis B. Hershey with the remark that
""The US Selective Service System has 
national manpower management responsibilities
far exceeding staffing the armed forces.""
by which he meant that US young men had
two, just two, options, (1) do well in
college or graduate school in STEM fields
or (2) go to Viet Nam.  Of course, that 
'responsibility' was only
in his egotistical imagination; still
he executed on his delusion.<p>Later much of the US 'military industrial
complex' concluded that there was a 
US STEM shortage.  So, the powers that be
got the NSF to set up a team of economists
to calculate, with essentially supply
and demand curves, how much 'stimulus'
would be needed to increase the labor
supply.<p>The stimulus didn't work well for US
citizens, so the plan was to write into
research grants in US research universities
that with the grant money so many students
had to be supported and that, hint, hint,
there were plenty of willing students from
India and Asia, hint, hint.<p>Then there got to be the H1B scam, mostly
just a new version of 'indentured servitude'
or 'slave labor'.<p>Basically, anytime STEM worker bees get
paid well enough to buy a house, big
forces in the US move to flood the
market with STEM graduates.<p>It's dirt simple:  It's capital versus
labor.  Capital has power and wants
cheap labor.<p>These US powers that be are just seeking
more money and power and, net, are seriously
hurting the basic strength of the US.<p>The solution is for US voters to become
informed and come together and vote
for the US for the US as a whole and
not just for the 1% richest capitalists.<p>Of course there's more at Prof. Norm
Matloff's<p><pre><code>    http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/h1b.html</code></pre>",1366851495

That means there's a larger target to ""hit"" when probing for information, and it makes picking up on plots much easier.

The majority of migration is going to be from the EU [1], and despite Europe's integration by way of treaties, I'm under the impression that someone fresh off the boat (metaphorically speaking) can't just suddenly claim all the welfare there is. Immigrants from non-EU countries have to be able to show their ability to support themselves before they're granted a visa, so I highly doubt they're a huge burden on society too.<p>Only something like 2.16% of population is from Morocco [2] and I really doubt they're the result of society's ills. While I can't find statistics, I highly doubt these people are draining the country's coffers through welfare payments. Also, why do you think they're constantly seeking health care? Even if they are, you seem to be saying they're unnecessarily visiting the doctor and are hypochondriacs; again, I struggle to understand why this would be the case just because they're from the middle east. Do you have any statistics available that demonstrate middle-eastern immigrants visit their GP more than born and bred Dutch, <i>and</i> are feigning illness? (I'm not saying it's untrue, I just can't find anything to support or refute your claim.)<p>The thing with the freedom of movement provisions is it works both ways: the Dutch are just as able to leave and move to another EU nation as other EU nationals are able to move to the Netherlands. Quite a good number of Dutch emigrate both to within and outside the EU, which is fair and fine.<p>Immigration, at least in the US, can be argued to have quite a positive effect on society. [3] I see no reason for this not to apply to the Netherlands.<p>What your argument really seems to boil down to is that there are people from a different tribe that are living among <i>your</i> tribe and, by way of confirmation bias, you notice all the things they do wrong.<p>No society is perfect and not all immigrants are going to integrate into society or be a net benefit, but many more will be.

Cuba<p>>Does that look like a list that's getting US support?*<p>Cuba not at the moment.<p>But it sure had full support when it WAS a dictatorship, under Batista.<p>The Cuban revolution on the other hand had lots of popular support, and it overthrew Batista, a dictator with the support of the US state, US business interests and the US mafia. Yet, the US didn't support the popular revolt and toppling of the dictatorship in Cuba, forcing them to ally with the USSR at the time. Until now, most of the plights of Cuba with poverty and all are not due to their government, but due to the US embargo. On the other hand, you don't have much trouble doing business with China.<p>As for other Latin dictatorships with US support, here's a nice list:<p>El Salvador (General Maximilio Hernndez- 1932)
""A failed uprising organized by EI Salvador's Communist Party founder, Farabundo Marti, six weeks after Hernandez Martinez had seized power in a 1931 coup, sparked the General's crackdown on ""communists."" ""Roadways and drainage ditches were littered with bodies,"" writes Raymond Bonner. ""Hotels were raided; individuals with blond hair were dragged out and killed as suspected Russians. Men were tied thumb to thumb, then executed, tumbling into mass graves they had first been forced to dig."" U.S. warships were stationed off-shore, ready to send in Marines to aid the General in case he ran into serious opposition.Hernandez Martinez was run out of the country in 1944, but his memory was celebrated as recently as 1980, when the Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez Brigade carried out a series of death-squad assassinations of prominent Salvadoran leftists. Farabundo Marti, killed during the purge, has also left a legacy: the rebels currently fighting the U.S. backed government of El Salvador call themselves the FMLN, the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front""<p>Nicaragua (The Somozas)
""The Marines invaded Nicaragua in 1912 and stayed until 1933, fighting but never defeating the revolutionary Augusto Sandino. They created the Nicaraguan National Guard and installed Anastasio Somoza Garcia in power. Then Sandino, who had signed a truce and put down his arms, was assassinated by Somoza. In 1935, General Smedley Butler, who led the Marines into Nicaragua, said: ""[I was] a high class muscle man for big business, for Wall Street and for the banks. In short, I was a racketeer for capitalism - I helped purify Nicaragua for [an] international banking house."" President Franklin Delano Roosevelt put it another way. ""Somoza may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.""<p>Guatemala
""A Christian has to walk around with his Bible and his machine gun,"" said born-again General Efrain Rios Mont, military ruler of Guatemala from March 1982 to August 1983. Rios Mont was one in a long series of dictators who ran Guatemala after the Dulles brothers and United Fruit, backed by the CIA, decided that elected President Jacob Arbenz held the country ""in the grip of a Russian-controlled dictatorship"" and overthrew the country's constitutional democracy in 1954. The succession of corrupt military dictators ruled Guatemala for over 30 years, one anti-communist tyrant after another receiving U.S. support, aid, and training""<p>Honduras (Roberto Suazo Cordova)
Honduras was the original ""Banana Republic,"" its history inextricably intertwined with that of the U.S.-based United Fruit Company, but in 1979, when Anastasio Somoza was overthrown in Nicaragua (see card 7), Honduras got a new nickname: ""The Pentagon Republic."" In 1978 Honduras received $16.2 million in U.S. aid; by 1985 it was getting $231.1 million, primarily because President Suazo Cordova, working with U.S. Ambassador John Dmitri Negroponte and Honduran General Gustava Alvarez, allowed Honduras to become a training center for U.S. funded Nicaraguan contras. General Alvarez, who according to Newsweek, ""doesn't care if officers are thieves, as long as they are virulent anti-communists,"" assisted in training programs and founded a special ""hit squad,"" the Cobras. Victims of the Cobras were stripped, bound, thrown into pits and tortured. The Reagan Administration claimed ignorance of these human rights violations, but U.S. advisors have admitted knowledge""<p>Panama (General Manuel Noriega)
""The U.S. command post for covert Latin American operations is located in the Canal Zone where a series of figurehead presidents, some backed by General Manual Noriega, have involved Panama in U.S. intelligence operations. Noriega first met with then CIA Director George Bush in 1976 while Noriega was collecting $100 thousand a year as a CIA asset.Their friendly relationship persisted even after Noriegas' drug dealing was revealed by a 1975 DEA investigation. During the Reagan era, Noriega collaborated with Oliver North on covert actions against Nicaragua, training contras and providing a trans-shipment point for CIA supported operations that flew weapons to the contras and cocaine into the U.S.""<p>Not to mention Pinochet, Mexican puppet scambags killing their own people, etc.<p>Also see for far more examples:

So it is totally a paradox, name it as 1 paradox. You see this is a mathematic problem at first, actually it is a philosophic problem. Then we can resolve it. Because math is a incomplete theory, only philosophy could be a complete one. The answer is that 0.999... is not equal to 1. Because of these reasons:<p>1. The infinite world and finite world.<p>We live in one world but made up of two parts: the infinite part and the finite part. But we develop our mathematic system based on the finite part, because we never entered into the infinite part. Your attention, God is in it.<p>......<p>

It's less complex than Rust, but also less ambitious. So you can pick your poison. Go's memory model, for example, has no concept of isolating memory between co-routines or threads, nor of controlling mutability. Everything can always race on the same global mutable heap. Similarly it has only one kind of pointer, which can always be null, and all pointers in all co-routines are subject to a single, global garbage collector. Rust statically differentiates all these cases, divides memory and pointers up into different types, which means we can control safety and performance much better, but at the cost of the programmer having to think more. Rust also provides a few extra ""modern bits"" that Go lacks: generic types, destructors, disjoint unions, that sort of thing. But to its credit, Go gets a lot of mileage out of the stuff it included, and I'm glad it's making headway.""<p><a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/08/Interview-Rust"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/08/Interview-Rust</a>",1366848102

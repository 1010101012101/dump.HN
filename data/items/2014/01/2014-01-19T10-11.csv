At least for him?  it doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting his work.<p>My opinion is that while it&#x27;s super nice, socially, to be around people who are into what you are into in person, it doesn&#x27;t make that much difference when it comes to getting actual work done.   Now, sales?  raising money?  all that bullshit where you have to interact with business people?  face-time matters a lot.  But for purely technical work, hell, I&#x27;ll be working in the same house as someone and I&#x27;ll communicate via IM, because it&#x27;s less disruptive.<p>On the other hand, he&#x27;s working for <i>me</i>  -  If you want to make money?  you have to find a competent business person, or at least a business person with money, and most of those guys want to look you in the eye.   Not all, but most.<p>That&#x27;s the thing; I get a <i>lot</i> of offers to merge, to invest, and to do other business-type things because I&#x27;m here and active in the community.  I&#x27;m not even that active.   But you know what?  I haven&#x27;t made a dime off of any of those.   (and some of those have cost me enough to buy a central-valley condo)    -  As for the parts of my business that actually make me money?  I could do those from just about anywhere.  Of course, that probably says more about my skillset than anything else;  I&#x27;ve had serious offers from people with serious money (well, serious money by my standards)<p>My own experience?  moving to silicon valley was more than worth it.  But, I&#x27;ve lived in silicon valley,  I&#x27;ve lived very near berkeley and I&#x27;ve lived in the central valley.  I haven&#x27;t spent serious time other places.  Avoid the central valley.  It&#x27;s not cheap enough to put up with the culture and weather, in my opinion.<p>Yeah, housing is expensive.  but the thing about housing?  well, the increase is a percentage of the cost of housing, so if you are okay with modest digs?  2x what you would pay for modest digs in the central valley (probably 4x what you&#x27;d pay in the midwest) still not very much money compared to what you are getting paid, and I&#x27;m okay with modest digs.   (Of course, if you like really nice digs... that percentage increase really hits you.)<p>One big downside to the south bay is that our public transit is absolute shit.   You might consider the Berkeley area for that.   VTA doesn&#x27;t look that bad on paper?  But it is nearly completely useless.  BART, on the other hand, is pretty good by west-coast standards.",1390128948

The only benefit I see is just a gee-whiz factor.<p>Why would I want to have to reach over and open a virtual filing cabinet? I can click a 2D folder easier and faster, and view the content faster in a line list. Reproducing archaic physical storage and work systems into a 3D space is going backwards, that includes a fake wooden desk and wastebin under it.<p>It&#x27;s not so much the headgear presentation I view as an issue, but rather the theory of the &#x27;3D&#x27; desktop. My prediction is that over the next 20 years, companies will attempt over and over again to push consumers into it, and it&#x27;ll fail every time because there is no real value gain. What will happen instead is 2D desktop interfaces will become multiplied and easier to use several of in a faux 3D space that is easy to use for your average person (by strictly limiting 3D spatial skill requirements or motion).

Functions are represented by blocks with terminals for input and output data. You wire functions together to pass data between them). Some aspects are horrible (primarily the maintainability of anything more than a trivial application), but they also do some interesting things that I thought were quite parallel to this demonstration.<p>Documentation is quite well embedded into the software, and comes up with a similar box detailing the docs for every function you come across. The system also shows you the flow of data through a programme, allowing you to debug and see the data types moving between functions. You can dive into sub-functions and see what data's moving through them. Debugging can be fantastically quick if you constructed your programme carefully. If you didn't though, it's hell (see the point about maintainability).",1334362953

It all happens automagically with a single shell command.<p>I won't use ES on it's own, because I have experienced situations in the past where the dynamic type mapping functionality gets confused, ie: the first time it sees a field, it indexes it as an integer, but then one of the later records has 'n/a' instead of a number. The entire record became unquery-able after that, even if it might have stored the original data.<p>You could fix this by creating the mapping by hand, BEFORE any data has been imported, as it can't be modified later. But what you have then is a situation where you have to maintain a schema to not get it to 'randomly' ignore data.<p>You also can't just tell ES to rebuild an index when you need to mess with the mappings, you have to actually create a new index, change the mappings and then reimport the data into the new index (possibly from the existing index).<p>It actually also feels right to me to split storing the data versus querying the data between separate applications, because they have different enough concerns, that being able to scale them out differently is a boon sometimes.",1334362892

3839384,comment,3837987,3837987,1,0,gdubs,,,"Although it was interesting to see the other side of this controversy, I have to agree with the folks here who felt it was too much like a PR piece. I don't know why, but every time the article mentioned the 'blogger', I detected a bit of disdain.<p>The standout point for me, from the Bloomberg article was that ammonia occurs naturally in beef. I don't know how much more appetizing it makes it, but it starts to sound a lot different than a ammonia of the household-cleaner variety.<p>What I don't understand is why, with all of the food-science being done on mass produced meat to make it smell like this, and feel like that, we even need to bother using animals in the first place. This recent piece by Mark Bittman on a new and improved fake-meat is pretty interesting in that regard: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/finally-fake-chicken-worth-eating.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/finally-fak...</a><p>The people here who talk about killing your own meat, and how people know that an animal died to get to their plate, and so on, I think, are perpetuating a false equivalence. The common perception, crafted by the food industry, is a cow on a placid farm that lives to a nice old age. A lot of money goes towards alleviating the image of thousands of sick, smelly cattle cramped into prison cells. (Full disclosure: I've become more and more of a vegetarian over time.)<p>So, besides moral issues related to suffering and health issues like increased resistance to antibiotics due to improper handling of waste at farms, there's also the issue of how much petroleum it takes to produce a calorie of beef (3 to 1 calories, or something similar if I remember correctly). And how toxic some of these farms are to the water supply. And how cow-released methane may be one of the main contributors to global warming. And so on.<p>But, I'm not really posting here to posit what some may consider to be fringe views regarding our food supply. What I found interesting about the article, and I'm guessing why it was posted here in the first place is that the Roth was a hacker. He came up with a brilliant solution to a problem. And, it would appear from the article that his technology is now under-fire because it makes for an easy target. Ammonia is the stuff you clean your counter with; you're not supposed to spray it on your hamburger.<p>I'm not a fan of ends-justify-the-means tactics, an after reading the article I do get the sense that people who would like to see reform in the food industry are using this as a way of raising public outcry. Shining a light on where our food comes from is good. But, unfortunately the outcome of this story will likely mean that an innovator is the loser and the industry at large will carry on just fine.<p>What would be great is to see Roth, or someone else with a hacker mentality set about transforming the industry into something more sustainable and less reliant on the farming of animals. The Bittman piece linked to above shows that it's possible for us to begin replacing at least some of our meat into non-animal varieties. Transforming a really old-school industry full of entrenched interests and out-dated  prehistoric  means of production should appeal to someone here, right?<p>Anyway, sorry for the long post  the subject is fascinating to me.",1334362339

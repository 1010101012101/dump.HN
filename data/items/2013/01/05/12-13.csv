Just add your other stuff on top of it, instead of in a completely different implementation.<p>I'm not even against experimenting with new engine ideas. If you need to create a completely different engine do it, but only because there is an important difference and reason to do so.<p>Today we just have different engines not because of some special differentiating factor or novel way, but just because a few companies hold to their old engines from the early days of the Web (namely Mozilla, Microsoft and Opera). Almost everybody else that came after Webkit has adopted it.<p>Some things just make sense to have one single and common base.

I sold people including all the royalties, like a Shutterstock for people with a fixed price (no matter how well known the client is). I had everything worked out: a simple signup process, legal protection for models (no nudity) and a legal framework for clients and my own company.<p>I upset the expensive agencies (boy were some mad at me), but ultimately failed because I underestimated how far people will go to get something for ""free"". People would rather spend 8 of their own hours finding friends, neighbors, relatives to use as a model, than select a perfect local model and pay him or her a few bucks. I work for a design agency for the biggest names you can think of but even those PR-people would rather throw away 8 of their own hours and work with shitty contracts if it could save them a few dimes.<p>Of course becoming blind didn't help.

I'm starting to think it's just not possible.</i><p>I agree with you that it's not possible, but not for any of the reasons that you listed in your sizable blog post. Most of the things that you listed could technically be combined into a single, extremely expensive device. But the reason it is not possible to make ""the perfect computing device"" is not technical, it's philosophical.<p>General-purpose computing devices have such a wide range of uses and every day humans are coming up with so many new ways to use such devices, that it does not make any sense to cram them all into a single ""perfect"" device. ""Perfect"" is relative. Perfect for whom? A Ruby programmer who likes to hang out at Starbucks? A graphic designer who juggles $10K worth of Adobe software? A photographer who backpacks around the world, often in rugged terrain? A scientist who needs a way to visualize the latest data from his particle accelerator?<p>Give me the most perfect Ultrabook that you can find, and I'll still complain that it doesn't come with multiple screens. Give me the most perfect tablet/keyboard combo that you can find, and I'll still complain that it only comes with 1 terabyte of storage. Or that the keyboard doesn't have a numpad. Or that I only get 30fps on my favorite game. Or that the pixels are too large. Or too small. Or whatever. Because anything you think is good enough to count as perfect will be seen as terribly deficient by a lot of other people who have different needs, and vice versa.<p>For a while, I hoped that the success of data sync tools such as Dropbox would make ideas like ""the perfect computing device"" irrelevant. Because people in wealthy countries would just buy several devices, from 27"" desktops to 7"" tablets to 11"" ultrabooks to 3.5"" iPhones, sync them all, and use whichever device suited their needs at the moment. It would be the combination of all of them and the way a person makes use of them that would be perfect, not any individual device.

The ipad, or even the mini, are fine, but that's because apps are designed for low information density / large font sizes. Desktop OS's simply don't fit well on screens below 13"" unless you have excellent vision, which I don't. Windows 8's solution of lowering information densities to cope with small screens is a non-solution, because the reason to use a proper laptop is to be productive, and productivity requires information density. I expect the tide to turn and screens to become larger again. 13"" is the bare minimum for me.<p>> The touch keyboard on the iPad is excellent, really<p>Again, not for me. I can't type properly on it. I'm using it right now and not liking the experience. I agree that it is as good as touch keyboards are going to get, but that simply is not good enough. I'm glad the tide is shifting and people are realizing that a proper keyboard attached to a tablet makes sense.",1357389300

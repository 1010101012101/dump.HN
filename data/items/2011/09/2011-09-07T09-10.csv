Far too much of our software development management is clueless (Dilbert is Revealed Truth and it was well established long before outsourcing became big), software development/programming itself is generally not well respected, etc. etc. etc.<p>The current US perspective on Indians is biased by the purely cost driven outsourcing craze, which made all of the above worse by the universal service business model race to the bottom, time zone and cultural differences (the latter is something that good management <i>could</i> help) etc.<p>We don't hate Indians per se (as mentioned, I've worked with some ones in the US every bit as good as any native born developer, even helped to provide one with a horse for his downtown Washington, D.C. wedding :-), we hate the system that's developed that results in our having to deal with very long turn around times for critical stuff, that all too often delivers us code that takes as long or longer to debug or re-write than it would have taken us do correctly in the first place, the constriction of entry level job opportunities and thus the long term career pipeline, how all this has aided the terrible age discrimination in our field, etc.<p>And certainly many of us ""hate"" the H1-B etc. visa systems that were established pretty much explicitly to drive down US salaries and replace US workers with cheaper foreigners.  If you're like me and have been replaced at some point by an H1-B visa holder (a brilliant Jamaican who was very good at the job and who was not happy about how the company was exploiting him (he was making 60% of what I was making)) that hate <i>of the system</i> is also based on hard, cold reality.",1315388533

We originally started as an IT support company. My IT skills were just average while my business partner was very highly skilled in IT.<p>Often, we would have issues with client servers, and i would spend hours trying to find the root cause of the problem, with not too much luck. When i would pass the job onto him, he'd figure out the cause of the problem in a much shorter amount of time, and therefore come to conclusion for a possible solution very quickly and with some conviction.<p>I always thought he was a complete genius, and wish that i was as clever and intelligent as him, and felt a little cheated by the universe that i hadnt been blessed with such great IT skills, especially since i had great passion for IT.<p>Its only after much frustration, that i learned that the only thing that differed between he and i was his approach. Whereas i would check the virus state, and processor usage and look for anything suspect on the desktop, he would check the event logs and then look up the error codes at the microsoft knowledgebase.<p>One i started taking the same approach as he, i found myself fixing problems even faster than him and coming up with even better solutions to the problem (all the while experiencing much lesser stress).<p>When i decided to learn programming , i observed the same thing. His approach to attacking programming problems was different to mine, and now i am learning to assess the problems in the same way as him.<p>I've also seen this in my cousin. He starts a project, and takes one step at a time, and breaks the larger problem done, all the while telling himself that there is an answer for each component problem he faces.<p>I am trying to foster the same mindset now, and this blog post is an inspiration for that.

That editor will keep the core functionality of Vim, and probably the core code base, but it will have to rewrite the interface from scratch, with Lua being chosen as the only embedding language.<p>I am not too unhappy with the current situation by any means, but it's precisely because I have a biased relationship with Vim that I feel uneasy seeing how civilized it is to write extensions for other editors.<p>That said, while my dream editor probably won't be Vim 8.0, it may be in the form of a brand new fork. I do think that sounds practical.<p>About your first concern, historically speaking, programmers as a community don't seem to mind porting things from one platform to another. It's actually quite a fun thing to do, especially if the new platform is polishedly designed.<p>Your second point is interesting. I admit it's something I haven't thought of and only sounds obvious now that you say it. I would say my dream editor will have to sacrifice the command mode altogether. If there is something you type in the command mode very often, you write it as a Lua function and bind to a key.",1315386951

Square could be the ""PayPal for Yahoo"" and Jack Dorsey is probably the closest person to Steve Jobs that you could get to run a company today.<p>Allow Square to operate separately, making Keith Rabois CEO of Square and put Jack Dorsey in charge of revitalizing the rest of Yahoo.<p>I think Yahoo's suite of verticals with the traffic that Yahoo has, if done right, could be the biggest asset for Yahoo and the closest thing to a unique asset that they have. So as a portal, Yahoo links to a lot of vertical services currently (Monster for jobs, Match for dating) or has there own owned-and-operated subsidiary (finance, autos, flickr).<p>Find ways that the verticals can be improved and invest heavily to do so. Preferably re-create verticals that are currently outsourced, but be patient with doing so. Be willing to shrink margins in the short term to gain market share. What is needed for each vertical will be different, but I imagine there is room for innovation and improvement in each. A lot of personnel changes will probably have to be made. The CEO (for this example Jack Dorsey) will need his cadets that he trusts to run the different products. I think a similar org-chart to Google's reorganization makes sense...a few people at the very top and then put someone in charge of each product and give them a lot of responsibility.<p>I think it may be possible to provide a rich and effective user experience so that overtime users would go directly to a Yahoo vertical instead of searching on Google or Bing/Yahoo. Also, Yahoo could then place some results from their vertical properties on top of the Yahoo search results to better serve Yahoo users (if they can actually do the verticals right). This could be a very interesting twist on search and a differentiator. It would be a risk, but I think something like that is needed to have a fighting chance to grow search market share which is currently at 17.9% and makes up 53% of Yahoo's revenue.<p>I wonder WWSJD? In Steve Job's 1997 keynote when he returned to Apple, he talked about vertical integration being the biggest strength of Apple, even though many others considered it a burden and a weakness. He admitted that many current Apple products sucked and that they needed to improved dramatically improve core products and kill off others in order to be competitive. He admitted the importance of integrating more tightly with Microsoft and didn't want to think of the situation as being Apple vs. Microsoft.<p>For Yahoo, their nearly complete suite of vertical products is potentially their biggest strength even though many consider it a burden and weakness. Yahoo has to admit that a lot of their products currently suck and will need to kill some off while dramatically improving others. Yahoo already admitted that they couldnt cut it in the resource intensive search game and got out.<p>I know it sounds crazy, but maybe the portal can make a come back. SEO spammers have dramatically lowered search quality in certain areas and has made it harder for people to find the content that they really want to find. A portal can make it easy for the average web user to find what they looking for with a higher signal to noise ratio by a combination of high-quality curated content, vertical sites and a Bing-powered search engine with a Yahoo twist.<p>In reality, I don't know whether Yahoo really has the assets, the cachet or the people needed to pull off this turn around. If I was on the board, I would seriously consider a buy out offer if a sweet enough one came to the table. That being said, this plan would be a whole lot more fun to see being played out.",1315386323

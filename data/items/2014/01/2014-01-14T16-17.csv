7058101,comment,7057651,7057960,8,0,nawitus,,,"I don&#x27;t quite agree with that. Specialization is a good thing, but having managers and coders seems too much specialization. It leads to the situation where a manager could fix something small in the same time he communicates someone to fix it. Or situations where the manager slowly loses touch with technology. It&#x27;s not likely someone will &quot;understand&quot; programming over the years without doing it constantly. And over time the manager&#x27;s value to the team withers away.<p>I like this idea that there are no managers who manage and engineers who engineer. Instead, there&#x27;s maybe one person who takes the responsibility of managing work, but does programming or other non-managing work the rest of the time. The engineers can also do a bit of managing, but they&#x27;ll focus on the engineering.<p>The assumption is of course, that managing work can be automated away sufficiently and the team is a not huge. These are realistic assumptions, but are often untrue because of organizatonal flaws (or flaws with the manager).<p>The baseball coach argument doesn&#x27;t really fit here, because baseball is not reinvented every 5 years. Programming quite often is. A C++ systems programmer probably can&#x27;t understand much about HTML5 frontend programming. But a manager with C++ background can learn.",1389718778

We often make the mistake of assuming that an AI will be similar to a human just faster or smarter, but that misses some of the key distinctions of an AI versus biological intelligence.<p>One of the most striking is the ability to radically alter the substrate and operation of an AI system.<p>Because of the emergent nature of intelligence, I suspect that many AI instances will be raised like children, tested and validated for specific environments and then large portions of their consciousness could be frozen to prevent divergence of their operational modes. AI systems could also incorporate self-auditors, semi-independent AIs which have been raised to monitor the activities of the primary control AIs. Just as we involve checks and balances in corporate or national governance, many AIs may be composite entities with a variety of instances optimized for different roles.<p>This will be desirable since you may not want a general AI intelligence acting as a butler or chauffeur.

7058001,comment,7057613,7057613,2,0,LinaLauneBaer,,,"I think that most &quot;massive&quot; view controllers come into existence because many developers don&#x27;t realize that you can avoid them by combining two features of Objective-C: Class extensions and categories.<p>The ability to add methods to existing classes is maybe the most misunderstood feature. People tend to see categories as &quot;bad&quot; (because they &quot;pollute&quot; the global namespace, …).<p>There are basically three ways to reduce view controllers. If applied correctly your view controller will be much more happy.<p>1. Replace &quot;helper&quot; methods in your view controllers with categories where it makes sense. Good candidates are methods which do not mutate the view controller. For example: Many view controllers I have seen have helper methods that create NSAttributedStrings based on a few parameters. This does not belong in your view controller. Make is a category of NSAttributedString instead and call it from your view controller. Also, every method that does not use &quot;self&quot; in it&#x27;s implementation should be a category method on a different class.<p>2. You can divvy up our massive view controller in multiple &quot;components&quot;. You should not create new classes for each component. Make a category on your own &quot;massive controller&quot; class for each component instead. Yes! There is no need to &quot;externalize&quot; something in multiple &quot;component&quot; classes. Just identify the different components that make up your view controller and create a category for each component. You can even split your massive view controller up and put each &quot;component category&quot; in it&#x27;s own file.<p>3. Use class extensions to give each &quot;category component&quot; it&#x27;s own state: You can have multiple class extensions per class. I usually have one class extension per category to give each it&#x27;s own storage/state. If you do it this way then your massive view controller becomes modular as well…<p>The three steps above make your view controller more testable. Remember: approx. 25% of your view controller code actually belongs in categories on UIKit/Foundation classes. Categories on these classes can be tested extremely easy since they have no dependencies.<p>So before you apply MVVM try to write good view controllers in the first place.",1389717827

Otherwise you have illegal regulations and bureaucratic turf-grabbing that will not treat the Internet well.

A federal appeals court correctly struck it down as exceeding the agency&#x27;s legal authority, as I wrote here in 2005: <a href""http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-5697719.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-5697719.html</a><p>If Net neutrality violations become an actual problem, there&#x27;s no shortage of publicity-hungry politicians in Congress (hi, Ed Markey!) who will hold hearings and push legislation forward.

7057698,comment,7057495,7057495,7,0,rayiner,,,"I like the idea of net neutrality conceptually, but the ulterior motives of its proponents bugs me. It strikes me as just a way for the Youtubes and Netflixes of the world to get a bigger piece of the pie for themselves.<p>Consider the basic streaming transaction: consumer tunes in to watch an episode of their favorite show on some streaming service. Several companies are involved in the transaction: the streaming service, the broadband provider, and the content company that made the show. But the consumer doesn&#x27;t really care about any of that, he&#x27;s willing to pay $X for the experience of watching that episode.<p>How that $X is split up amongst the companies in play is the subject of a lot of legal wrangling. Each party has an incentive to try and turn the contributions of the other parties into a commodity. The streaming service and the broadband provider have an interest in weaker copyright protections, so the content company has less leverage. The streaming service and the content company have an interest in net neutrality, because that prevents broadband companies from differentiating their services from each other, and forces them to compete only as &quot;dumb pipes.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not clear what the &quot;proper&quot; division of that $X should be. Arguably the content creation is the least fungible from the consumer&#x27;s point of view. If they want to watch &quot;House&quot; that&#x27;s what they want, not some substitute. The broadband provision is arguably the most technically complicated and the one that involves the greatest capital expenditure. Distribution is, in my opinion, relatively simple. Computing power and commercial bandwidth are commodities thanks to AWS and the like. So all that differentiates Netflix from Hulu from Youtube is the software. The software isn&#x27;t easy per se, but it&#x27;s easier than making a blockbuster movie or building a fiber network. That&#x27;s why streaming sites are a dime a dozen but it takes the likes of Amazon or Netflix to even attempt to compete with NBC, etc, in developing AAA content.<p>That&#x27;s almost certainly why Netflix is getting into the content business, and why Youtube has always been in the content business (through user generated content). That&#x27;s what&#x27;s hardest to turn into a commodity.",1389715310

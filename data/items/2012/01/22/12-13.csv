When the motivation is some kind of business interest, for example, it does not make much sense to reinvent the wheel. On the other hand, when the motivation is to explore concept-space, it does not make much sense to not reinvent the wheel. Motivations determine the proper course to take and no motivation is superior to another.

So here he goes: a proof sketch of the halting problem for 12 year old programmers.<p>Suppose that somebody wrote us a program that can check whether another program will  loop indefinitely or eventually halt when run on a particular input:<p><pre><code>    bool halts(string program, string input){ \n       // halting checking code that checks \n       // whether program's main function\n       // halts when given input\n       // returns true or false\n    }\n</code></pre>\nFor example:<p><pre><code>    string program = \n      ""void main(string foo){"" +\n      ""  if(foo[0] == 'a'){ return; }"" +\n      ""  else{ while(true){} }"" +\n      ""}"";\n    \n    halts(program, ""abc"") // returns true\n    halts(program, ""bar"") // returns false\n</code></pre>\nNow we can write the following program:<p><pre><code>    bool halts(string program, string input){\n       // same halting checking code as above\n    }\n\n    void main(string program){\n      if(halts(program, program)){\n        while(true){ }\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNote that this is a perfectly valid program. halts() is supposed to work on <i>any</i> program, including a program that happens to contain the source code of halts(). We can just reuse the code that the person gave us and copy-paste it here.<p>Now the question is: what will our halts() function say about this program, when given its own code as input? In other words: what will the following code print?<p><pre><code>    bool halts(string program, string input){\n       // same halting checking code as above\n    }\n   \n    void main(){\n      string program = \n        ""bool halts(string program, string input){"" +\n        ""   // same halting checking code as above"" +\n        ""}"" +\n        ""void main(string program){"" +\n        ""  if(halts(program, program)){"" +\n        ""    while(true){ }"" +\n        ""  }"" +\n        ""}"";\n\n      print(halts(program,program));\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThere are just 2 possibilities: either this program prints true, or this program prints false (if this program never terminates then halts() has a bug).<p>Case 1: suppose halts(program,program) returns true.<p>If the halts function is working correctly, that means that when we actually run the code in `program` with `program` as its input, it will halt. But now lets see what actually happens. When we run the main() function in `program` with `program` as its input, it first checks `if(halts(program,program))`. Well, we already assumed that halts returns true, so control flow will go inside the if block to the infinite loop. But that means that halts lied to us!<p>Case 2: suppose that halts(program,program) returns false.<p>Now a similar argument holds. run the code in `program` with `program` as its input, the condition of the if statement will be false, and the main function will terminate. So even though halts(program,program) returns false, the program actually terminates. It lied again!<p>As you can see, no matter what halts returns, it cannot tell the truth about the program we constructed. Hence it is impossible to fill in the missing code in halts() so that it will work correctly.",1327235088

3496404,comment,3494636,3494810,1,0,xyzzyz,,,"The situation with Goedel sentence (let's call it G) is actually not very different. As neither G nor negation of G is provable, you could also say that it contains extra information, and add negation of G as a new axiom to PA, just like you could add CH to ZF.<p>If you do that, you could wonder what your new arithmetic looks like. This is actually very interesting question. Since ""not G"" says basically ""it's not true that there's no proof of me"", or, more specifically, ""it's not true that there's no number that represents the proof of me"", it's clear that ""not G"" asserts the existence of a certain ""natural"" number being the proof of G, which is not one of the natural numbers we know (since no ""regular"" natural number represents the proof of G). In our new universe there are ""natural"" numbers that you cannot reach by counting. Because of that, one can construct many different nonequivalent ""implementations"" (models) of PA + not G, which are necessarily different than the standard implementation of artihmetic we know (1, 2 = S(1), 3 = S(S(1)), ..., n = S(S(...S(1)...)), with + and *).<p>What is interesting about incompleteness theorem is that no matter if we add arbitrarily large number of axioms to PA, or even infinite number of axioms generated by computer program we write, the resulting system will still be incomplete, and each will have its own (many of them, actually) Goedel sentence.",1327234470

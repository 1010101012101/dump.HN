16766,comment,15628,15687,0,0,jmw,,,"The traditional claims for success/failure of companies inside/outside of the valley comes from Venture Capitalists who have years worth of statistics coming from their own investments.<p>The stats point to a change in percentage chance of success for any incremental distance from Palo Alto/Mountain View that a venture funded company is moved. (I don't know the numbers offhand - but it's significant, even down to whole percent numbers per 10 miles if I remember correctly)<p>From someone who's recently been talking to many people about the choice to live in Boston, Mountain View/Palo Alto, San Fran - or somewhere else, every person (investor/entrepreneur/historian) points to MV/PA.<p>Many people (and firms like Sequoia ...etc) won't invest unless you're in the valley.<p>",1177530740

16759,comment,16597,16731,0,0,startupper,,,"I concur with you re: angel investors and societal support and an understanding of what it takes to build a company around technology.<p>But I also think a society that is vibrant from a cultural perspective is equally important -- you need a multicultural mix of art, science and liberal thought to attract the fringe elements who _think_differently_ to your environment.  The multicultural aspect is necessary now more than ever considering the global context in which technology is applicable.  It is these fringe elements who create startups.  Both Stanford and San Francisco provide that mix to the Bay area.  You could say that Iowa lacks this, as does most of the USA between NYC and SF.<p>In Canada for instance, there is the right cultural mix, but a lack of intelligent capital.  So I agree with you.<p><p><p>",1177529168

16754,comment,16754,9770,0,0,jcconnor,,,"I recall Mr. Gates in the mid to late 90's talking about the impact the Internet was going to have on their business model and their efforts to be at the forefront of that.  The problem was, and always has been, that they couldn't and can't change their entrenched business model for a new one.  Typical to the Innovator's Dilemna, an entrenched organization cannot easily remodel its' business practices to meet new challenges.  IBM has, to some extent, but the premier example is, obviously, Apple. In the cases of IBM and Apple they had to undergo an almost complete demise of the company to fight their way to a new approach. I'm willing to bet that a similar situation will come about in the case of Microsoft.  The only question is will they (like the others I mentioned) be able to recover in time or will they be the Wang of this century?\n",1177528670

Say, Calculus for example.<p>Do you see why your question is hard to answer?  Don't feel bad, we all get excited when we hear about a new cool tool that promises to solve XYZ.  Java (back when it was new), wavelets, Bayesian analysis, RoR, etc..  Consider two extreme options:<p>1) Find a problem you want to solve, and then figure out what tools will help you solve the problem.<p>2) Learn a tool really well, and then start applying it to problems.  (grad school is really good for this.)<p>If you really want to do (2) with Bayesian analysis, look at this post: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=14540"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=14540</a> .  Either path requires lots of effort, but both can be rewarding.",1177527653

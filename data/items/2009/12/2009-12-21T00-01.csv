Until then, if people have a burning need to use gocouch, they'll have to add that small method to the http package.

Two columns - comments form (left) and the comment form (right). the (right) comment form which is small since characters are limited to 140 characters.  The (left) comments column has the comments in floating blocks, this makes short comments show in a single row. I am anticipating short comments since the post only contains a tweet and a photo. My copy is ""Add new Comment' with a dynamic comments block header if there is 0/1/more comments. Anyone see new experiments in comment forms?",1261356827

On edit:HN, commenters generally delineate their comments between that which is based on empirical evidence, and that which is their own conjecture.  This intellectual honesty that many, but not all, HN users engage in makes HN 'feel' more reliable than TC.  The rub is that when HN is used as a reliable source, that same intellectual honesty feels obliged to point out the fact that the source is not reliable.

Firstly, the ""Russians"" behind these investments are really just one fund called Digital Sky Technologies.<p>Secondly, although this fund is located in Russia and is composed in part of Russian money, the fund also includes investments by Goldman Sachs and Tiger Global.<p>Thirdly, neither the Facebook nor Zynga investments are clearly recklessly lavish.

That is the very definition of being a high bidder and, of course, being the highest bidder is required to win.

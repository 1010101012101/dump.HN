5604280,comment,5603782,5603893,6,0,anonymoushn,,,"Is there any functional difference between a system that considers race and a system of racial quotas?  As far as I can tell, the difference is that one of them will have a very slight random deviation from the other.<p>It is simple to construct a non-quota admissions system from a desired set of quotas (though one would probably do well not to write down the desired set of quotas).  Each year one could adjust the bonus/penalty assigned to each race to target admissions levels at the hidden quotas.  Conversely, given a set of per-race bonuses and penalties and admissions data for a particular year, one could calculate what (non-quota) admissions level was most targeted by the set of bonuses and penalties.<p>Edit: It is perhaps even more troublesome to hear ""There is no formula for admission. We look at the academics, leadership, activities and references about the applicant's character.""  If a school explicitly states that it is not looking for anything in particular in its candidates, it would be very difficult for any investigation to find that it is turning away qualified candidates on the basis of race.",1366840691

>So let me get this straight: GPA + test scores don't show merit, but race does?<p>I think he's implying that cultural differences could be coming into play that skew the curve while looking like racial discrimination. Just like Academic scores differ between races, I'm sure Athletic honors differ between races as well, as well as Club honors, and Arts (band/choir/etc) Honors, and so on.<p>If you want to argue that Academic merit is all students should be judged on when colleges are considering applications, that is a separate argument, but GP is probably just saying that GPA + test scores doesn't singlehandedly define ""merit"" to a college because things like community service and athletics and student council and... and... and... all altogether factor into the cumultive merit of any given applicant in addition to GPA and whatnot.",1366840601

Gold was almost never the exclusive currency, usually wasn't the most common currency, was rarely a significant direct currency (rather than <i>backing</i> for currency) when people actually <i>used</i> currency for most transactions, and when it became the exclusive <i>backing</i> for currency, only ""worked"" because the actual circulating currency supply became increasingly disconnect from the gold notionally backing it.<p>Gold, as a currency, works tolerably well much of the time (though still can break an economy with unexpected surpluses or shortages) in the way it was actually used -- the high-value-density one of several commodities used in currencies in systems where most transactions using currency don't use gold, and most transactions don't use currency at all, but not even tolerably well outside of that domain.",1366840595
5604267,comment,5600883,5603388,1,0,wting,,,"Well there is the ""official"" definition on Wikipedia.[0]<p>Informally, my definition of a functional programming language is one that
supports functional style as the default. (Hooray for using a recursive
definition. :p) The language should strive for referential transparency and the
language and compiler should be optimized for functional idioms.<p>Let's define the sum of a list functionally[1]:<p><pre><code>    # Python
    sum = lambda x: reduce(int.__add__, x, 0)

    # Haskell
    sum = foldl' (+) 0
</code></pre>
You could write this same function in C using function pointers and arrays.
However it's not very convenient to do so. You would need to write a reduce
function, an add function, anonymous functions don't exist, and syntactically it
would be very messy. On top of all this, the compiler is not optimized for
reduce functions vs an imperative for loop.[2]<p>More generally, functional style typically refers a style of programming where
most functions are pure and side effects are contained specifically. This allows
for easier reasoning of a program's correctness.<p>John Carmack has a post about functional programming in C++:<p><a href=""http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/04/26/functional-programming-in-c/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/04/26/functional-programm...</a><p>Summed up, functional style is about containing side effects and functional
programming has built-in support for common idioms.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming</a><p>[1]: This ignores the fact that sum() is already provided in most functional
languages.<p>[2]: Python straddles my definition of functional programming and that's why
it's awesome and frustrating at the same time. It supports many staple
functional idioms but is not optimized for it.  Function calls are very
expensive, and thus recursive performance is also hurt tremendously.<p>Plus Guido hates functional programming:<p><a href=""http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-python...</a>",1366840590

They are underpaid paper pushers forced to judge people who are likely smarter than they are, with very little information.  There are two main reasons for the holistic evaluation.  One, to give themselves plausible deniability when they need to tweak the student body to fit institutional purposes.  Two, to introduce sufficient randomness into the process to reduce the incentive to game the process.<p>The truth is that top private schools are in the business of soliciting donations from wealthy donors and selling an image of prestig while avoiding major controversies.  Having a heavily Asian-dominated student body doesn't serve any of those goals.  They are politically weak, not a threat to organize and are seen as foreign by a large portion of the population.",1366840085

A:   In 1975, the federal government said that Hillsdale had to sign a form stating that we did not discriminate on the basis of sex. Hillsdale College had never discriminated on any basis, and had never accepted federal taxpayer subsidies of any sort, so the College felt no obligation to comply, fearing that doing so would open the door to additional federal mandates and control. Our trustees pledged two things: first, that the College would continue its long-standing policy of non-discrimination, and second, that it would not accept any encroachments on its independence. The case went to court, and Hillsdale College won a partial victory, but the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did rule that Hillsdale College was an indirect recipient of federal funding because of participation in federal grant and loan programs. In 1984, Grove City College in Pennsylvania fought and lost a similar legal battle. The case then went to the Supreme Court, and in Grove City v. Bell, it was determined that if even one student received a federal grant or loan, it made that institution a direct recipient of federal funds. To avoid the hassles of government control, Hillsdale College announced its decision to end participation in all federal financial aid programs in 1985. In 2007, Hillsdale announced that it would no longer accept State of Michigan taxpayer subsidies earmarked for student financial aid, thereby making the College completely independent of taxpayer support.</i><p>Basically once you take their money you agree to their strings.",1366838980

To some degree there's a baseline expectation for the practical purposes of filtering (with lots of outliers for various reasons), but at the end of the day it doesn't say much about how intelligent or capable someone really is.  Intelligence and capability can't be reduced to a test-taking skill.<p>I am Asian-American and I went to an ivy league university. I think (hope) that essays hold particular importance for admission to the most competitive schools because academically there's very little variability between most serious applicants.  Everyone was the valedictorian, everyone had a 4.0+, everyone had 1500+ on the SAT (out of 1600).  Everyone played an instrument, everyone was in every honor society, everyone performed hours of community service.  When you get that far as an applicant you know how to play the academics ""game.""

I would have loved to have seen the manner in which topics and ideas spread over your network.<p>For instance: If an event occurred in New York, say, how long would it have taken to spread to San Francisco? If there were no progression, topic times would center around the same time. This would indicate that people were getting their information from national, not local sources (e.g. the evening news), then talking about it on facebook. On the other hand, if a local topic was spread on facebook alone, we should see some sort of progression.<p>It's possible that this progression could take more interesting forms besides geolocation, but that might require a more extensive network. A simple experiment would work like this: A few thousand people who are not friends but have a similar interest (say an interest in Elizabeth Warren) post independently a video of her. This particular esoteric interest is unlikely to be valued a priori by their friends, but perhaps they are compelled to repost the information. What's the threshold of ""esotericness"" such that it won't ""go viral?"" Is there a way to predict virality as a function of how popular it is to begin with? Is there no actual progression across the network, but rather a small bump in topic expression, until it is picked up by larger media sources at which point the entire network is inundated with people reposting Elizabeth Warren recaps from HuffPo et al?<p>The reason this is interesting is that it sheds insight into the role of social networks: are we fundamentally disposed toward central sources like the NYTimes, or is facebook a fundamental <i>sharing</i> mechanism? That is, do I post on facebook just to have my views expressed, validated, and challenged, so that they might change the world over a few years? Or do I post on facebook to have my views <i>propagate</i> across the world much more quickly?<p>Finally, a question: How did you estimate the power law? I know how difficult it is to do this (e.g. not linear regression on a log-log scale). Did you compare the power law fit to other, similar distributions, like lognormal? Preferential attachment is indeed a beautiful theoretical result, because it implies the existence of power law degree distributions. Unfortunately, many networks are not as well represented by power laws as by alternative distributions, which casts doubt on the preferential attachment hypothesis as is. (Also, many sampling methods give rise to fictive power laws). That said, a fat tail can still be interesting.<p>In any case, this is a beautiful piece of work.",1366838413

I'd like to see at least one from a leadership perspective (the lecturer is the obvious leader in a physical class.. who's the leader online?  Is there one?  Can more than 5% of the population lead themselves?), maybe one from a peer pressure perspective, maybe one looking at ancient apprenticeships vs presentations we have now in brick -n- mortar vs watching videos online of the presentations.  I don't need another interpretation of social interaction as a fail.<p>One interesting anecdote is way back when MOOC marketing was gaining traction, in the very first original AI class, a coworker and I both took the class and then dropped it.  We socially interacted quite a bit, at least as much as I did back in physical school, but we both dropped it.  I ended up reading the entire book, very good intro to AI book and worth my time so I can't blame either social interaction or the quality of materials in this anecdote.  Dropout rates vs physical interaction with fellow students would be an interesting study.

While there are other factors such as athleticism, social endeavors etc. SAT score is still often viewed as one of the key determining factors. It is of no doubt that Asians that apply to these top universities as a whole have higher SAT scores. However it does not say of their other qualities, those were perhaps the reasons why there was a lower acceptance rate for them.<p>In our current educational system, the only transparently comparable bar is the SAT score, while every other factor is more or less arbitrarily judgmental, e.g. can be manipulated. Asians learn that in order to become better, they'll at least put down efforts to increase the clearly visible bar to increase their chance. It is not to say that they will overlook the other factors, just since they aren't as apparent and obvious, they will make sure their SAT score does fare better.<p>One argument can be that because Asians put down more effort and time in their SAT (bookworms), then they will not be able to fare better in other metrics. I won't say that this doesn't make sense, it does, but it calls for generalization bias. Especially when a data set has been collected that speaks for a year's worth of group, I do not believe the general idea that Asian are less adept in other metrics is true.<p>Under this assumption, when we see data that SAT score (the only visible metric) is actually leveraged against a person's race, that is plain racism. Not saying racism is a bad thing, if schools determine that collectively as a whole they need diversity to strength the core values, racism is just one factor to play with to achieve their goals.

However actual success rates are staggeringly worse, like single digit may as well round down to zero.  So as simple engineering guess, the cause of failure simply cannot exclusively be lack of interaction.  If that were the case, a more realistic failure rate would be 50% or so because probably somewhere around half the population cares about that based on examination of extreme claims.<p>That leaves the article with little more than the usual ""we all know the correct way for humans to live is to be extroverted, and clearly radio lectures / internet lectures are not an extroverts paradise, so lets marginalize the introverts and pat ourselves on the back for figuring that out to be the failure of MOOCs, how lame of them not to cater to our talkative desires as the masters"".

There is a huge hunger in the masses for better forms of programming.<p>This point will probably become obvious if the Wolfram Language is successful.",1366837261

Well, I think they'll get interesting when they can 'know' about high-level entities like cities, countries, zip codes, ip addresses, etc. Basically, everything that Alpha knows and can compute about, we want Mathematica to know and compute with.<p>2. I used Go because I am very productive in Go and like a lot of things about it. Goroutines are neat. Java is fine, it's just very boilerplatey, and I'm not practiced enough at it to get past that. And I don't see why we can't develop a GoLink as well.<p>3. Probably not the whole stack, at least in the beginning. But we'll get there. We want to make it really easy to spider websites and so on.",1366837246

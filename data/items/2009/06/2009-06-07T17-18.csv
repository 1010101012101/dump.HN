Brains are malleable to some degree, but genetics are still very important.  One of the more convincing pieces of evidence is the similarities in the abilities of twins raised in separate families.  He recounted case studies in which identical twins who had never even met each other both had the same proffession, favorite hobby and even shared odd habits, such as wearing a rubber band around their wrists<p>More bluntly, if intelligence ""owes little or nothing to genetics"", why is it that children acquire an understand of the language spoken in their home while house pets do not?<p>As Chomsky's discovery of universal grammar implies, humans already have a great deal of what we need for language processing built into our brains from birth.",1244397395

What they care about are things like: should I set a <i>width</i> property or a <i>height</i> property? To which you might reply: fine, just pass the dimension around and have a <i>set-size</i> function that knows whether to set width or height depending on the dimension, and so on. I say: yeah, you can do it that way, but it takes more code and is harder to read, because now you have to write it in a dimension-agnostic way, which is not how humans (or I at least) like to think about these things. It's easier to write or read the concrete version for one dimension and then say ""the other dimension is just like this only transposed"", which is exactly what the macro does for us.<p>Do you need macros to make such a program work? No. Can you use them to make the program shorter, clearer, and more generalizable? Yes.",1244397319

646107,comment,645992,646088,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""the peer group is far more important than parents in the child's development.""<p>That's during the school years. I'm only talking about kids younger than four. Also, I'm talking about the cognitive development of structures which become relatively fixed after age five. (Like extraversion and executive function.) The peer group is more important than parenting, but only for predicting the trajectory of further academic achievement, which is completely different from the ways in which parenting styles affect cognitive, emotional, and physiological development.<p>EDIT: Also, speaking of peer groups, one of the reasons good parenting is critical is because schools sort children into different tracks as early as age six. In principle, track placement is temporary. In practice, it is quite permanent. To quote one researcher, “We found that first-grade ability-group placement can have 
persistent effects on children’s achievement in school over a period of several years and may shape the expectations of children’s performance held by significant others, such as parents and teachers. Whether these effects are instructional, social, or institutional, they are real, and they have implications for children’s future schooling trajectories. […] Instructional grouping may have the 
unintended effect of increasing inequalities in educational outcomes, largely by creating inequalities in educational resources and rewards.”<p>(This comes from Equality and Achievement, and also from Pallas et al. “Ability Group Effects: Instructional, Social, or Institutional?” Sociology of Education 67 (1994).)",1244397096

646082,comment,645250,645250,0,0,pedalpete,,,"I personally think your installation demo would lead directly to a no sale. 
There are a few reasons.
In your demo video
1) The first thing you show is an error. I understand why you do this, but saying to somebody 'here's the error that comes up when you first start' isn't a great experience. 
2) I suspect that the installation looks overly complicated to anybody who is not already familiar with how to set-up a website and sql, and you even go on to show them how they can change their settings in text if they need to. If you made it so simple, why do they need that info. You also take the viewer to a command prompt, and look at their database tables. Non of this spells 'Unprecedented Ease' to me. 
3) You don't show what making an actual web-page is like. I suspect that is going to be the most important thing for most people. They can probably get through the install (though I suspect you should be able to make it an better experience), but I want to know what it looks like to build a site.<p>Looking at your documentation on 'creating a page'
1) you say that a user entering a field in to a form must put the '_' character between words. If this is so simple, you should be doing that for the user. Don't let the user make a mistake, you're supposed to be taking care of them. 
2) 'Now for the really interesting part' you say. Put this code in the form??? wait, if you're making this so easy for me, why do I need to know code? Plus this is now code that I would need to learn, so I am going to need to learn how you think it is best to implement.<p>Basically, similar to apsurd, I think you've gone middle of the road here. You've taken out some of the work for programmers who probably don't mind writing the code, and you haven't made it simple enough for non-coders, and you're forcing them to learn too much stuff.",1244395253

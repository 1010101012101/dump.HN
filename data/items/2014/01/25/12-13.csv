Often it is required you buy it through the University. Universities roll many services into one package. It is not uncommon for University programs to target bettering both physical and mental health.<p>Psychiatric services are just one more Health benefit.

7120649,comment,7119379,7120396,12,0,DanBC,,,"I&#x27;ve had extensive experience caring for someone with severe and enduring mental illness.  That person had several stays at MH hospital, some as an informal patient and some as a patient detained under various sections of the mental health act.  In about 6 years that person&#x27;s DSH was severe enough to require surgical treatment and inpatient admission to general hospitals or hospitals with specialist services.  (Eg burns and plastics wards). I have personal experience of accessing specialist mental health services.  All of this is in the UK.<p>I can confidantly say that you are wrong when you say I have no experience of people in acute psycjiatric distress.<p>Locked rooms is very unusual.  Locked wards are not normal.  A person might need supervision to leave the ward but they are not prisoners and are not treated like prisoners - risk is managed by closer supervision (I know a person who had 2 members of staff within arms reach at all times) not by locking them in a room.  There are <i>rare</i> exceptions to this with special soft rooms - all blue with heavy crash mats. In gloucestershire this room is in the low secure forensic unit, which is in the grounds of but seperate from the main adult mental health hospital for the county.<p>A person at severe risk of self harm or suicide will be able to do so in a very bare room - smashing their head on the walls or floor, using their clothing as a ligature.<p>Strip searching patients is inhumane. Intimate searches of patients is just bizarre.  Especially when we remember the overlap between people who have a mental health problem and peole who have been sexually abused.  Being stripped and intimately searched is distressing for most people, but could be especially so for victims of sexual abuse.<p>The UK charity Mind recently did a report about restraint for aggressive patients and for patients who needed rapid tranquelisation.  This is something that should be used as a last resort in very clear situations.  That report talked about the need to protect people from unneccessary restraint.  I mention this because even this clearly protective measure (even most service users recognise a need for appropriate restraint) is looked at carefully to see if there are safer kinder alternatives.<p>We can&#x27;t tell from her post how severe her wound was.  She doesn&#x27;t mention any drips, so we don&#x27;t know if they needed to give her fluids or not.  We don&#x27;t know if they used sutures to close the wounds or if they ised steri-strips. They didn&#x27;t admit her for surgery.<p>If her story is true it is shocking.<p>You say that you&#x27;ve experienced similar or worse.  I am very sorry you went through that, and I am angry other people who should have been caring for you put you through that.<p>(I&#x27;ve noticed a couple of people mentioning my tone so I am trying to work on that.  Sorry ifthis post sounds aggressive or grumpy, it isn&#x27;t meant to.  That&#x27;s just my poor use of English).",1390654320

But this doesn&#x27;t mean schmoozing at parties or sector events. You want people to find you through your work - that way your work is the salesperson. As a bonus, your clients will feel like their reaching out to you, rather than being sold something.<p>Saying you&#x27;re a great designer at a party in one thing, having them find you through your work is another thing altogether. They can see you can do what you say you can do.<p>But how do you get people to find your through your work? This requires effort, time and a bit of hard work. But the investment is worth it.<p>You need to do things - you need to be active. Then you people to find your stuff organically.<p>So:<p>* Now is the time to kick off that little side project you&#x27;ve been meaning to finish for the last 12 months;<p>* Now is the time to complete that article you&#x27;ve been meaning to write for the last 6 weeks;<p>* Or kick up that HN or StackExchange account again and start answering questions<p>* Do something more innovative, i.e., write a book, etc.<p>For the next couple of weeks you need to invest your time in doing stuff. Start that blog. Get your twitter up and running again. Try to commit 2 hours a day. Get up a little bit earlier than usually, and work a little later.<p>Then submit your best stuff to relevant networks, like HN. Or push out a link to your friends and colleagues, asking for feedback. Hopefully it will start to pick up traction.<p>But, most importantly, at the end of all this new stuff that you&#x27;ve developed/written say that &quot;You&#x27;re a freelance webdesigner/consultant/etc, and that you&#x27;d love to grab a coffee in X location with anyone that&#x27;s interested. Email me now.&quot;<p>This might take a bit of upfront effort but it&#x27;s worth it. Getting your first few clients will be the most difficult, but it gets easier - because these clients will hopefully refer you on to other people, and your business will start picking up traction.<p>So, in summary:<p>1. Clients (rightfully) fear giving money to new people<p>2. You need to show these people that you&#x27;ve got skills (and not just a business card)<p>3. The best way to put potential clients at ease is for them to find YOU through YOUR work. That way your work is the salesperson, and not you<p>4.

In trials it often boils down to defendant vs prosecutor and judge - whereas it should be defendant vs prosecutor watched over by a neutral judge.<p>How neutral the judge is depends often on his political alignment, the alignment of the defendant, possible stereotypes that might apply to a defendant and of course if there is some reputation gain for a judge in case of a conviction.<p>While in theory the system of a neutral judge is good in practice it&#x27;s pretty flawed because no single human can really be neutral.<p>I wish we had a jury system in Germany because that way you at least need 12 people to fail instead of just one - who might have hidden motives for a conviction - for someone to get wrongfully convicted.",1390652161

Often without basic legal guidance, many of them become fully intimidated by authority (police, FBI...). <i>Become an informant or face an exorbitant amount of your life trapped in our cage. OK? Good. You&#x27;ll be wearing this wire.</i> This pressure often results in people being intimidated to the point of risking their lives merely so forces can pursue &quot;higher-ups&quot; in a chain. In an abysmal, draconian, dangerous game that is a state&#x27;s drug war, I needn&#x27;t mention how risky being a &quot;rat&quot; could be. Many of the informants/victims are naive. They do not know their potential rights or seem to have no better alternatives. It&#x27;s tragic.[1]<p>There are other types of informants, obviously. I&#x27;m not referring to informants who act upon true desire and commitment to &quot;truth&quot; and not threats. I don&#x27;t know the motives of the guy in the article.

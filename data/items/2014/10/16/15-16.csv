Counterintuitive as it may be, just taking money and giving it to poor people is a very good investment in terms of the public good that results. A rich individual investing into a funded company is much more visible, but that same money spread more widely might launch hundreds of &quot;lifestyle businesses&quot; that would ultimately be more productive.",1413475191

8465591,comment,8464532,8465360,0,0,freshyill,,,"It&#x27;s true that most sales taxes are regressive, but you can have progressive sales taxes as well. A few examples:<p>In New York, there&#x27;s no tax on clothing and shoes under $110 (at least that was the number when I lived there a few years ago). If you&#x27;re buying stuff that costs more than that, then you can probably afford the tax, since there plenty of completely fashionable and functional items that cost far less.<p>In many (most?) places, there&#x27;s no sales tax on most foods you&#x27;d buy in a supermarket, but there is on prepared foods and restaurant meals.<p>You could probably take these even further by raising the taxes on more expensive clothing items. If you&#x27;re buying a $1,000 purse or eating a $500 meal, you can probably afford a higher tax rate.<p>It would probably be challenging to apply a progressive sales tax to everything, but it&#x27;s certainly possible for many purchases.",1413475106

I&#x27;m criticising IQ tests, but I&#x27;m not suggesting we create a more complete test, I&#x27;m suggesting the whole idea of measuring intelligence numerically is fundamentally flawed.<p>There are a few reasons I believe measuring intelligence numerically is flawed, but probably the central one is that I don&#x27;t believe it exists as a fixed entity, I believe it&#x27;s adaptive depending on the circumstances we find ourselves in.<p>As with any debate on human traits the tendency is to go back to the nature vs. nurture question. I believe you can have a natural aptitude for something, but the environment you live in is what helps your intelligence develop, and this is the largest differentiator in what we perceive as intelligence. Put simply, change the environment and you change the intelligence. Therefore scores like IQ do not measure someone&#x27;s true potential, they only hint at what they&#x27;ve already been exposed to. That&#x27;s why to me such tests are a waste of time.",1413475050

For many people that come to us, the decision is something they think long and hard over before making that leap, being fully aware of what they will learn and what their continued learning will have to be in order to gain employment upon completion of a course.<p>Many of our students want to improve their overall job prospects, knowing that with tech skills (basic knowlege of coding, for example) their overall market value is significantly increased as every industry becomes more and more reliant of those with this knowledge. And not just developers. Hiring managers, CEO&#x27;s, designers. The list goes on and on. Of course for those who do want to become developers this is an excellent start.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how the idea of teaching people valuable skills is in any way troubling. It&#x27;s fairly discriminatory to older learners, or those who simply did not have the opportunity to learn at university to say that there is no hope for them now. Online programs like ours give people who haven&#x27;t been exposed to programming a chance to learn in a supportive, mentored environment. Our mentors, who work the rest of the time as freelance developers, are able to pass on their knowledge and experience to their students in a similar way to how an apprenticeship would traditionally work.<p>And if our students do decide to become developers then learning coding languages is a pretty good place to start, I would say. It is a start that will, with the right experience and learning curve one day lead to a job. We all have to start somewhere and personally I think it&#x27;s unfair to ostracize talented people simply because they haven&#x27;t been lucky enough to have been exposed to a specific skillset earlier in life.<p>Many thanks for your comment.",1413474976

I think it is safe to assume that we all thought we were more than ready to deal with ONE patient. Not the case.  The President just said we are learning and making changes.  Really? Now?<p>You are missing a very important point.  It is my fault for not making it explicit.  I&#x27;ve been using bio/tech attacks as a general term and yes, there&#x27;s an immediate association with terrorism.  The problem is far deeper than that.<p>What do you think is going to kill us all?<p>Here &quot;us&quot; isn&#x27;t an egocentric &quot;USA&quot; but rather a &quot;humanity&quot; us.<p>What will kill us all?<p>Nuclear bombs?<p>War?<p>A meteor?<p>Nope.<p>Evolution.<p>Not ours.

And while we spend billions developing weapons to kill each other we seem to be neglecting the reality that we are not the enemy, evolving bacteria and viruses are.<p>In that context terrorism might not be a factor.  If viruses or bacteria get past that evolutionary &quot;click&quot; that turns them into, well, weopons of mass destruction, terrorism will be the last thing we have to worry about.<p>Now, what we, the world, have to do is take a 100+ year view of humanity, grow up and start moving towards the things that really matter.  I would be shoveling, no, trucking money into programs to develop all manner of systems, products and organizations to fight a war that could be an existential threat to our species.<p>So, you see, when I worry about e CDC or government wasting over a decade getting ready for patient one of an unknown killer event I am thinking well beyond Ebola.

The first week/month on the app store gives a boost to keyword rankings that can be leveraged to build good traction. Unfortunately it also requires some experimenting to get them right, so this initial launch in 1-2 countries can provide that data.<p>2. Building some traction and credibility so that when we launch on the other app stores, we can build on that (for e.g. #1 on the Canadian App store would have a nice charm to it, if we achieve it!). This again helps with point 1 (better traction in launch week/month).<p>3. Ensuring Support is not overwhelmed by unforeseen issues.

My CS classes had plenty of cheaters and those who used their academic-powers to brute-force memorize enough to get through the course but you knew they didn&#x27;t truly understand what they were doing. These are the people I think of when I give fizzbuzz<i>(with a twist)</i> in my job-interviews.

I got to talk to one of the developers of Sonic the Hedgehog music team, a Pixar employee was there<i>(Pixar is like a 5min drive from this college)</i> and someone from Industrial Light & Magic(ILM) was there. One of the presenters was very honest about the possibility of job placement. She made it clear to everyone that the chance of landing a dream job is not high at all; that anyone who goes through this program is doing it for personal passion and internal drive. She set expectations properly. Having the skill from classrooms was one thing, but it was up to the individual to really breath life into their skill and it took some luck on who you know to really make it in. e.g., these are the people hoping to make it: <a href=""http://galleries.cgsociety.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://galleries.cgsociety.org/</a><p>I just hope that the students of careerfoundry know that it&#x27;s one thing to learn coding in school, but it&#x27;s up to the student to really go the extra-extra mile and learn things on their own.... and a bit of luck as well.",1413474478

People who were opposed to Prohibition, that is people who thought that alcohol should be legal to produce and sell, pointed out that Prohibition greatly increased corruption of police forces in many places. People who supported Prohibition pointed out that alcohol causes many medical harms for many users. The historical record shows that they were both right. When Prohibition was repealed, corruption of local police forces to prompt police to look the other way and not enforce Prohibition went down, but deaths from cirrhosis of the liver and other bad health effects of alcohol went up.<p>I&#x27;m on record here on HN (I won&#x27;t look up the links to previous comments just now) as being persuaded by Richard Branson&#x27;s argument that decriminalizing marijuana in the country Portugal reduced use, and thus ended up reducing individual and societal harm from marijuana. That country still has court-supervised drug treatment programs (but without criminal penalties) for drug users. As far as I know, Minnesota&#x27;s de facto policy is much like this. There is a federal law of the land in the United States that criminalizes sale and even possession of marijuana, but there is minimal enforcement here of statutes against possession of small amounts of marijuana. There is a big industry here of drug treatment centers, and people come to Minnesota from all over the world to get clean from drug addictions. If we can devote more law enforcement resources to more serious crimes, and fewer to enforcement of minor possession offenses, I&#x27;m fine with that. But I also hope that most people never start to use marijuana at all, and everyone who does use it is careful to get a reality check from sober people on how well they are really functioning.",1413473938

A six-hour day is more than enough effort to keep you employed. As in most corporate jobs, you could probably get away with 2-4 (spending the other hours at your desk, but learning skills for the next job) if it&#x27;s not obvious.<p>You get in trouble for 20%T (being &quot;distracted&quot;) if it pisses your manager off, if it looks like you&#x27;re trying to engineer a transfer off an undesirable project, or if you <i>appear</i> to be putting 50% of your time into the project.<p>The reason 20%T usually fails (on employee-initiated side projects) is that it&#x27;s really hard to launch at Google without a full-time launch. The standards are really high. You have to cover a lot of bases that you wouldn&#x27;t be expected to worry about in a startup, and you&#x27;ll need to get enough SRE (reliability engineer) support to cover 24 hours. It&#x27;s not unreasonable that Google is that way, because they have an understandable brand concern when it comes to reliability in new services.<p>Most successful uses of 20%T are to engineer a transfer, but managers are wise to that and not supportive. That game is actually a bad thing, because it means that to get a transfer requires auditioning, dividing your efforts, and putting your standing on your main project at risk. It&#x27;s actually a lot harder to transfer to a good project within Google than to get a job at Google. This also means that you can 20%T for the purpose of transferring, only to get screwed on &quot;headcount&quot; and have put your standing on your main team at risk for nothing.<p>I don&#x27;t think that your typical, run-of-the-mill manager is going to punish you for 20%T alone, but if the Perf gods decide that he has to stick someone with a &quot;2.9&quot; (bad Perf) this cycle, then having one foot out the door puts you at risk of being the one thrown under the bus. And once you get a 2.9 it&#x27;s impossible to transfer.",1413473759

It&#x27;s simply dishonest to pretend that isn&#x27;t a life changing amount for a middle class family. At the very least it&#x27;s going to be like you said- modest home paid off(100-500k), car loans all paid off(50k), and student loans paid off(300k if your kids went to expensive schools and you have 3 of them).

It&#x27;s all a matter of picking the tradeoffs we can all live with.<p>That being said, wealth redistribution doesn&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> need to mean less private sector capital investment.

Like income tax you have various &#x27;bands&#x27;\n2. The more you spend/consume they higher the band you are in\n3. Lower bands pay less\n4. Someone with little money buying just the essentials consumes e.g. $10,000 per year. Band 1 (a tax of say 10%) starts above $10,000 and thus this person is exempt.\n5. If you buy Ferrari&#x27;s, mansions etc. and consume $5m per year you would be in one of the higher bands and would pay a higher tax rate (say 40%).<p>In other words the little people keep all their money as it&#x27;s only spent on essentials. People who have disposable income pay back a percentage of what they spend.<p>Your argument that it would discourage spending and be bad for the economy is fine but I don&#x27;t think it would hit as bad as you think. Say I can afford to spend $1m on a car but because of the 40% consumption tax it will actually work out as $1.4m at the end of the year will I still buy that car? Chances are that $0.4m isn&#x27;t a big deal to me. Sure I might not like it but I probably have enough disposable income that I&#x27;ll pay it.<p>The key is getting the tax bands correct so that your disposable income is still high enough that after the tax you will still buy the item. You will have less purchasing power but the money going into the tax system could be used to offset the decline in economic growth.",1413473669

It seems unnecessarily limiting.  I think it is perfectly acceptable for people to agree to systems where no currency or barter exchange is necessary.  For example, buying seats in a law making house...how is that an improvement over a representative voting scheme that is not paid for?",1413471854

I think the simple fact is that there&#x27;s a lot more information to teach that falls in the &quot;what&quot; category. The actual hands-on work of historians is not something you really study in detail unless you&#x27;re a history major, I think (I wasn&#x27;t). In the case of science, I think virtually all children learn about how science experiments are done and the scientific method early in their science education -- perhaps that wasn&#x27;t quite what you meant. You might be right that the how doesn&#x27;t get enough focus. But I think that if a student is interested enough in science to be a scientist, that person will not be deterred by missing out on that.",1413471773

I have lots of pure crap in my bitbucket and github accounts, because I tinker and explore outside of my day job. I even have one project that is almost complete (that is, it functions without bugs and doesn&#x27;t make me want to scratch my eyes out when I look at the UI), but because I work on it for an hour here, an hour there, in the capacity of said exploration, the quality of the code is...less than stellar. Yet somehow I manage to be employed without a single gap in my resume.<p>That I don&#x27;t have a high-code-quality complete project in these locations says one thing and one thing only about me, with respect to being a signal to employers: I&#x27;m not willing to devote myself 100%, heart-and-soul, to programming at my peak for 10+ hours a day.<p>You&#x27;re deluding yourself if you think your comment about being a bad career decision applies outside of a small sphere (usually web-dev or mobile-dev for startups seeking a very particular kind of employee (young, naive, willing to work long and hard for relatively lesser pay).

Reddit is also host to some terrible stuff. It semi-deliberately makes no delineation between the two beyond a thin figleaf of &quot;NSFW&quot;. Some of the stuff behind NSFW is merely porn, some is a useful safe space for sex discussions, and some is well into the &quot;cannot unsee&quot; category. The &quot;randNSFW&quot; button is rather dangerous. Users aren&#x27;t bounded either, so you have a lot of people with obscene usernames commenting in otherwise sensible subreddits. And posters themselves encourage cross-pollination. The &quot;creepshots&quot; people eventually got banned, but the only thing you really can&#x27;t post anywhere on reddit is child porn. Racism is widespread.<p>Twitter is a brilliant platform for both entertainment and protests. However, it has very poor anti-abuse features, so users may be subjected to large volumes of abuse (Caroline Crialdo-Perez, for example) about which they can do little.<p>Hacker news prefers to flag &quot;controvertial&quot; topics off the front page, which at least causes arguments to be starved of pageviews and die down.

47666,comment,47560,47661,0,0,asdflkj,,,"That's a meaningless statement. Are you implying there is a definite line between secure and insecure systems? That's false. Are you saying that given a choice between a security feature and a convenience feature, most users will choose the security one? That's false too. Are you saying that if you ask a user, ""do you prefer secure or insecure systems?"", he'll say ""secure""? That's true, but irrelevant. There are a dozen more ways that could be interpreted.",1188345153

47656,comment,47390,47390,0,0,adrutledge,,,"I do agree with the article's point.  Money is an abstract representation of wealth, a way to procure wealth -- the things we may want.  Now, that said, money and wealth both tend to have strings attached.  Investment, at least, is honest about that.  On the topic of ""acquiring"" freedom, its been my experience that unspent money, potential for wealth, does more for providing freedom, because it provides the flexibility to react to a changing situation in a way that allows one to take the path with the fewest consequences.  Not always the path that costs the least or that requires the smallest effort, but there are opportunity costs in everything.",1188343838

I can speak on C# vs. php - I just finished a job with php and started C#. Originally,I thought I loved it because of the library (ie dataset, dataview,gridview), and garbage collection. Then the object orientedness of it all got really, really hard to implement rapidly. I may still use it to write sockets and hwnd stuff for windows (I'm a game dev), but for web stuff, I'll stick with php and maybe learn py.",1188343712

47651,comment,47560,47641,0,0,vegashacker,,,"I hate when websites store my password.  It's quite irksome when, if you forget your password, they send it to you plain, in an email, instead of just sending you a reset link.  When I get these emails, I know they are storing my password, and in all likelihood, they are storing it in plain text.  The worst offense was when I once ordered some business cards: Packed in with my shipment was an invoice with my password on it.  Huh?<p>We never know our users' passwords.  There's a brief moment, during registration, when we technically have their password, but it is immediately thrown away after we store the hash of it in the DB.",1188343277

Here's an example of what I mean by there being no generic ""good"" team:<p>Give me the top 5 athletes in the world.  Maybe you pick Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, Roger Federer, LaDainian Tomlinson, and Wayne Gretzky.  Or maybe you pick Barry Bonds; or a top marathoner or sprinter or a boxer.  Then I tell you we're playing basketball.  And you get beaten by Venezuela.<p>> <i>Again, thanks for sharing your experience.</i><p>I think you're taking what I'm saying the wrong way.  <p>I'm pointing out that if you don't care what you work on, your results won't be as good.  Thus, you should figure out what you do care about, and work on that.

Gradually adding new stuff isn't stressful for users, compared to a redesign, and rocking the boat is the last thing Ebay wants to do, considering that their only advantage over competitors or potential competitors at this point is momentum.",1188342792
47647,comment,47452,47594,0,0,geebee,,,"I'm not actually arguing against licensing software developers in principle.  It may eventually make sense -  though right now, I think it would be premature.  What I'm most opposed to is licensing under the ABET/FE/PE path.  I'm not sure if you've looked at the exam before - I'd recommend browing through some sample FE tests at the library or bookstore.  Think about what they're testing, and what you think it takes to write extremely secure, stable software.  The overlap is tiny.  Software development also has something in common with mathematics.  Should we require everyone pass an exam based on Real Analysis, Group Theory, and Topology to write code?  That's only slightly more absurd than requiring that they pass the PE exams.  <p>As for talented people... well, there are ways to get around the ABET degree.  But if we license under the FE/PE route, physics majors will be at a disadvantage, and math majors will face major hurdles in sitting for the exam.  So I definitely don't think that it's absurd to conclude that licensure would reduce the talent level in the field if that licensing is based on the PE route.  Again, this isn't an argument against lisencing in principle, it's just an argument against favoring civil engineering majors over math majors where it comes to writing software.<p><p><p>

2480883,comment,2480481,2480732,1,0,pstack,,,"The problem is that some people feel some other people hurt the overall cause. There are plenty of hackers out there (using the legitimate Eric S. Raymond definition) who would respond to the antics of Anonymous with ""Even if we agreed with your sentiment, the way you present yourselves hurt all of us"". This is a similar case.<p>Additionally, the response by RMS seems kind of odd. I read the original letter and it didn't imply that the author disagreed with RMS. It merely took issue with how some of the extraneous bits may undermine the rest in the eyes of a greater public. Saying that he is skeptical of advice from those who disagree with him is a non-sequitor. It's like me saying ""I used to use CVS, but then I moved to Subversion and now GIT is my preferred RMS"".<p>There's a certain skill in presenting a cause and a view to a greater public that you're trying to educate. If RMS's cause is merely to preach to the converted, then what is the point? I don't think he is, however. After all, it's the Free Software Foundation. Not the Free Software <i>Club</i>.  If the only people who listen to him are the ones who already like him, then the cause is stagnating.",1303725569

2480881,comment,2479865,2480854,6,0,arethuza,,,"What I meant was that the cultural impact of the policies of mass arrest, torture, murder and imprisonment probably had a much deeper social impact in the Soviet Union (and the areas they conquered) than in Nazi Germany (and their conquered areas) as the Nazis targeted specific racial and political groups and if you didn't belong to these groups then your chances of being arrested were pretty small. However, in the Soviet Union the arrests were being made primarily to feed the requirements for slave workers in the camps - not just for political/racial reasons so anyone could be arrested  - often for trivial things (e.g. having a foreign stamp in his collection got one poor soul 10 years in the camps).",1303725487

2480871,comment,2480461,2480461,1,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"The first anecdote originates with Clay Shirky. The vital missing detail is that the TV programme was ""Dora the Explorer"" which has a weird postmodern thing where a mouse cursor appears on the screen and clicks things. It's not unexpected in that situation for a child to look for a mouse.<p>Of course in this age of iPads and iPhones the child would be as likely to not know what a mouse is for. Which gets to the core of my issues with all this ""born digital"" or ""digital native"" stuff. Someone growing up with an NES is different from someone growing up with a computer, is different from someone growing up with an iPad, is different from someone growing up with home internet access, is different from someone with pervasive mobile internet etc. It makes no sense to draw an arbitrary line in the sand and say everyone after this point was born digital.",1303724808

But to do so, you have to acknowledge certain, <i>impure</i> realities about Free software in the real world. Stallman, as essentially a theoretician, is not the right person to acknowledge those things. The real world gets messy, growing a movement involves marshaling conflicting people, it involves Politics.<p>Stallman doesn't get Politics, he's not a pragmatist, it's not in his blood and he's just not the right person to take his idea past seed planting into orchard growing. It takes a completely different kind of person. Expecting to be anything more than what he is will only ever leave one disappointed.",1303724616

a: drop what you are doing and listen - they have taken the time to try to understand what you are doing and to help you to improve.
b: listen to the feedback with an open mind, ask clarifying questions and have a proactive problem soling approach to solving the issue
c: thank the person for the feedback at the end
<think of a practical and doable solution, and don't be afraid to offer your help to the person.><p>The whole process should take 5 minutes or less, and should focus on one specific behavior.

6911964,comment,6911558,6911805,1,0,dualogy,,,"> Suppose we all switch immediately to a gold standard. When the value of the currency rises too high, more people will go and mine it.<p>An interesting twist on the basic problem with fixed-price gold standards but you might be right for countries that have gold in the ground outside of controlled mines. But a fixed-price gold standard is a big fail no matter what price is set and subsequently has to be defended by the central bank. It worked &quot;somewhat, sub-optimally, for a while&quot; in the old days of a handful of developed slower-non-realtime economies that could coordinate policy and had the rest of the world colonized, today, no chance. Central bankers will never again go for it because they have learned that politics and private banking will always screw with the money supply for short-term objectives.. and no matter what fixed gold price you set, before long there&#x27;ll always be a run on your gold. Better to mark reserves to market (as France has pioneered in the 70s and the ECB and others do today), so you don&#x27;t need to constantly defend or redefine your fixed price, can manage the currency supply based on both long-term mandates and short-term needs and have its performance evaluated in gold and/or other currencies by the market forces, too.<p>&quot;Any nation/state can put its economy/currency on a gold standard. They only have two requirements. Own a stockpile of gold and raise the price very high&quot;  ;)<p>It&#x27;s funny that the &quot;free-market advocates&quot; these days favour a government-controlled fixed gold price, which they call &quot;the return to an honest gold standard&quot;. Right now we have an &quot;almost free-market gold price&quot; in &quot;almost free-FX-market floating (competing!) currencies&quot;. Not quite there yet according to some pundits but that&#x27;s where the world is heading and has ever since the Nixon shock. Definitely a pretty impressive move that has emerged toward a &quot;free market in moneys&quot;, what&#x27;s not to like!  ;)",1387155577

Its helps identify problems, and once identified you can make adjustments and fix it. In our sprints people can &#x27;flag&#x27; stories if something is slowing them down, and normally you find it&#x27;s consistent issue with multiple stories. If you remove it, then you have a instant productivity boost. When we implemented scrum we found a lot of stories were going back and forth between requirements and development stages, so we knew where the problem was.<p>It&#x27;s also about guidance. The people implementing the project, probably don&#x27;t have accurate representation of customer value, only the customer does. Teams often have vision of how things should be, but normally its inaccurate and you implement things with the wrong priorities.

Homeless people may be almost universally poor, but most of the poor are not homeless.  I will go further and venture that most of the homeless are not homeless because they are poor but rather because they are either suffering from either serious mental disorders or substance abuse or both.  As a consequence, the ways you solve the &quot;poor&quot; problem and the ways you solve the &quot;homeless&quot; problem are different.

LE deals with domestic events and U.S. people, while IC deals with non-domestic actors and locations. There&#x27;s a bit of overlap, for example, a U.S. citizen doing bad things in a foreign country gets a bit of both, or a foreign national in the U.S. But that&#x27;s generally where the line is drawn. U.S. law doesn&#x27;t apply outside of the U.S. and it shouldn&#x27;t. Can you imagine the world if the U.S. suddenly decided that France had to apply by all U.S. laws including the U.S. Constitution? If people think New Zealand cooperating on<p>> What makes me a potential criminal, and Mr. Smith not?<p>The reverse is true of U.S. citizens w/r to other country&#x27;s intelligence apparatus as well.<p>IC agencies <i>generally</i> aren&#x27;t looking for criminals...meaning they aren&#x27;t looking for people who broke U.S. law. They&#x27;re basically looking for threats to U.S. soil, citizens and concerns. LE agencies look for law breakers. That&#x27;s one of the reasons why the trials at GTMO are such a mess, guys were wrapped up and sent off to Cuba for interrogation based on &quot;Intelligence&quot; but not using information collected as part of a criminal prosecution. IC and LE really do operate under very different methods (at least in the U.S.).<p>princeverma: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911007\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911007</a><p>> I am a foreign national, I and my company uses services provided by a US company (email etc.), and this gives right to you guys to collect and ready my emails?<p>Yes.

At least in my circles, Snowden is not mentioned in polite terms. The likely outcome will be no change in NSA collections or capabilities, but automation in system administration, better collection of auditable information on IC employees and more compartmentalizing of the activities even further.<p>room271: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6910827\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6910827</a><p>> My question to the OP: even if you believe that at the moment abuses are rare and that your colleagues are trustworthy and law-abiding, does the capability and level of information concern you in terms of the potential for future abuse it enables?<p>I&#x27;ll toss in my answer too. I think it is serious cause for concern. But the kind of work the IC does is <i>hard</i> and I&#x27;d say impossible to get right. Anybody who thinks the kinds of work that most of us do in our day-to-day businesses is hard have no idea how really difficult the industry is. In a normal business, if you get things wrong you might get sued or shut down. In the Spy industry? countries might fall, nukes might loose and people might die. Doing that kind of work in balance with people&#x27;s rights, or at least not negatively impacting truly innocent people is among the hardest things to do in the world.<p>aaron695: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911046\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911046</a><p>> &quot;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.&quot;<p>Doing nothing would be for the U.S. to not spy at all, which is a sentiment shared by many in this forum. And then bad things would certainly happen for the U.S. because no other country would do the same. Sometimes doing the right thing really involves doing hard things that don&#x27;t feel good. I won&#x27;t make any apologies for it and nor should the OP. The kind of work that the IC and the military does, make no mistake about it, is ugly ugly work. It <i>is</i> very important though that this public debate be held often, and constantly. The IC/Military construct is like a huge guard dog. You want it a bit mean and angry, but you don&#x27;t want it to bite you, the mailman or the neighborhood kids...it&#x27;s not so bad if it goes after the occasional solicitor or burgler. So it&#x27;s very important that you keep a constant eye on it and keep it in check. Because it <i>will</i> dig up your yard, chew up the sofa and otherwise misbehave.",1387155008

I don&#x27;t think there are many in the IC who would have a problem with more (and better) oversight...it helps them feel more legitimacy in what they&#x27;re doing. All that being said, assume that there will be another COINTELPRO or similar. It sucks, but to be perfectly honest with you, you aren&#x27;t important enough to convince one way or the other about it or about approving of the various collection programs the NSA is running. If half of the comments here are to be taken at face value, almost nobody on HN knows enough about the issues involved to be consulted or for their opinion to be considered. I&#x27;ll draw a parallel here to the outcry over technology centered court cases or software patents, an opinion often given here is that engineers or software experts should be involved in deciding those cases because the layman doesn&#x27;t know enough about it to have an informed opinion. It&#x27;s just as true with IC issues. What&#x27;s troubling is that oversight is via Congress, who until the last election were likely laypeople themselves. So the expertise to properly evaluate, oversee and monitor what&#x27;s going on simply isn&#x27;t there.<p>sedev: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911078\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911078</a><p>> This reads like it was penned by someone who&#x27;s never heard of the Stanford Prison experiment or Milgram&#x27;s research...<p>You bring up good points. One of the issues with the IC is one of internal monitoring (as we&#x27;re all now seeing). Who watches the watchers? There&#x27;s notionally a number of very serious laws, or committees and counter-X professionals who are supposed to be doing this, but to be honest. Once you&#x27;re cleared and stuck on a project, there&#x27;s really very little day-to-day oversight of any kind. I personally would welcome a higher level of scrutiny, but I think the equation of &quot;spend manpower watching watchers&quot; vs. &quot;spend manpower looking for bad guys out in the world&quot; has, and will continue to, balance on the later.<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911091\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911091</a><p>> If you&#x27;d never heard of parallel construction before today, that seems to powerfully undermine your credibility.<p>He only worked there for two years on a single program.

Saying the NSA is LE because they cooperate with LE is like saying the Department of Agriculture or Labor is an LE agency because they sometimes have to cooperate with LE.<p>jjoonathan: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6910922\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6910922</a><p>> It&#x27;s good to hear that many NSA employees take the police/military distinction seriously, but we know for a fact that some higher-ups don&#x27;t...<p>This is true, and it&#x27;s particularly vexing to work in the IC and have senior officials asking you to participate in outright illegal activities. It doesn&#x27;t happen often, but I&#x27;ve seen both people ruin their careers saying no and those that want to keep their job and say yes. It&#x27;s usually under the auspices of &quot;helping out to stop bad things&quot;, and it&#x27;s very hard to say no when activities are couched that way...despite very many of the people on here talking publicly about their very righteous and moral high ground, placed in the same position, the vast majority of HN users <i>would</i> want to stop bad things from happening even if it meant crossing the line a bit here or there. Because, honestly, if you choice is help stop innocents from getting killed vs. sit on your hands because of some futzy law someplace that ties your hands, most of us would feel like we&#x27;d rather take the immediate action to stop the bad guys. &quot;Mission Expediency&quot; is the word of the day when it comes to these matters.<p>mtgentry: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6910911\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6910911</a><p>> No offense to OP, but this reads like propaganda to me.<p>I can confirm that this represents the mindset of most of the people I&#x27;ve worked with in the IC. It does take a certain kind of personality to sign-up and go through all the hassles involved with getting employed in the IC and that self-selection seems to attract a certain kind of personality type.<p>> But I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there was some sort of concerted effort by the NSA to encourage a dialogue with hackers on platforms like HN.<p>There really isn&#x27;t, other than to not discuss classified information. Keeping track of what&#x27;s classified and not when you spend near a third of your life and half of your waking hours dealing with only classified things is complex enough that most people just don&#x27;t engage with the &quot;unclean&quot; public.<p>jurjenh: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911235\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911235</a><p>> What I&#x27;d be more interested in is how much this issue is being discussed internally. If these discussions are allowed, or even surreptitiously encouraged, then I&#x27;d take that as a possible internal propaganda push, subtle as it may be.<p>Discussions about these issues, in the way that they&#x27;re being discussed here, are not terribly common. The milieu of working in the IC just doesn&#x27;t lend itself to these kinds of topics, in these kinds of ways, as focuses of conversation. Mostly what&#x27;s discussed is the lines you aren&#x27;t supposed to cross and the penalties for crossing them. But more often then not, casual conversation is about <i>anything</i> other than IC topics. After a hard day of spying, you really want to just engage in something else.<p>Bizarrely, discussing Snowden might be tricky inside of the IC because you might discuss something that was leaked that you technically don&#x27;t have a need-to-know for.

For example, a Air Force analyst who is cleared to view TS//SI material won&#x27;t have access to the NSA systems directly. Some of the NSA systems have external (Intelligence Community (IC)) facing equivalents that omit quite a bit of the information that less scrutinized IC analysts shouldn&#x27;t have access to. w/r to the information the NSA collects, NSA employees and contractors are held to stricter standards about how that material is used and treated. An analogy, a minor commits a crime and his record is sealed. The local court employees who handle the record, the judge etc. have really nothing that prevents them from leaking that information to an overzealous cop or lawyer or some such other than the standard to which their held for their job. It&#x27;s more or less the same thing with the NSA.<p>> The mental leap here is subtle, but substantial. Since I have been told I can&#x27;t use US selectors , I assume the system enforces this.<p>Actually, one of the higher standards the NSA employees are held to, and I believe they sign something to effect is that it&#x27;s outright illegal for them to do so and even one misuse could result in loss of employment, clearance (a death sentence in IC heavy employment areas) and possibly time in prison as a felon. This is taken <i>very</i> seriously and I&#x27;ve never known an NSA employee to <i>not</i> treat this rule and US citizen data as radioactive to them.<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911054\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911054</a><p>> Definitely a bizarre mix, I thought it was a parody a couple of times. To combat the threat of nuclear war with the completely isolated totalitarian state of North Korea we must create and store copies of all global communication...<p>It&#x27;s easy to generalize, and if the world worked as simply as the model you propose here, then things would be much better for everybody, but it simply doesn&#x27;t. For example, to uphold various sanctions regimes, by law, the U.S. <i>must</i> know if a business has connections two hops out that are linked to any bad activity. For example, how did Kim Jong Il buy all his whiskey? It&#x27;s outright illegal for a U.S. company to sell to the North Korean government. Okay, so they sell to an overseas distributor who then sells to the North Korean government. Turns out that&#x27;s illegal as well and the government must take action to not allow the U.S. whiskey maker or the distributor to operate in the U.S. any longer. Okay, so the whiskey make checks out their distributors finds one who doesn&#x27;t sell to NK, but one of their customers <i>does</i>. Same deal, it&#x27;s illegal for anybody in that chain to operate in the U.S. After that, the chain becomes so long it&#x27;s not worth looking into and Kim Jong Il was eventually able to get his whiskey.<p>Just talking whiskey and North Korea here, but you can guess it goes for all kinds of goods and countries under various sanction regimes. So how do you propose things <i>should</i> be collected? Collecting only on North Korea gets you nowhere, it&#x27;s everybody else who may or may not be supplying whiskey to the Norks that makes things much harder and requires a much larger collection apparatus.<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911216\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911216</a><p>> It&#x27;s helping diplomats illegally snoop on our allies.<p>Good! Our allies are most definitely snooping on us! Spying and espionage is sometimes called the second oldest profession for a reason. There&#x27;s been no time in history that two countries aren&#x27;t doing a bit of spying on each other, most <i>especially</i> at the diplomatic level.<p>rst: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911150\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911150</a><p>> In fact, it&#x27;s been known for months that the DEA receives intercepts from the NSA in such volume that they have an office devoted to handling them (the DEA&#x27;s &quot;Special Operations Division&quot;).<p>This <i>is</i> a problem. In general, the work the IC does in collection does not hold up to LE scrutiny. Having worked on both sides of the fence, LE is both more difficult in some cases and easier in others to work in. For example, you need a warrant to gather phone records in LE, but you can share those records more freely once you have them. In the IC the opposite is true, you can pretty much get whatever you need, but it&#x27;s virtually useless if a criminal approach is taken. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s often simpler to blow up the target then to arrest and try them. Parallel Construction is an investigative focusing approach that saves LE from getting collection warrants that go nowhere. The IC approach is to find the connections or whatever, then help LE figure out where to focus their warrant-based approach in doing the same collection from their side. Scrubbing U.S. Persons IC data and reusing it directly for LE is highly illegal for all of the participants involved.<p>revelation: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911022\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6911022</a><p>> Well, following his explanations, you can fail the polygraph and just do it again. The cost of failure is zero, so really just keep trying.<p>Actually the penalty after enough tries is no clearance which means no job and a permanent record that you were denied a clearance...which pretty much deep sixes any attempt in the future to get one. In some parts of the country, like the Washington D.C. area, that&#x27;s virtually a career death sentence.<p>kabdib: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6910969\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6910969</a><p>> My best friend&#x27;s dad was a spy in the CIA<p>> During the 70s and 80s my dad worked with Russian scientists<p>> So, how likely is it that my email is read, that my phone records are looked at, and so on? What are the chances that I&#x27;ll have trouble the next time I cross a border or try to board a plane? One percent? Fifty percent?<p>Assume it is collected but probably not read, but not for the reasons you gave above. There&#x27;s just simply not enough manpower to read everybody&#x27;s email, and it&#x27;s a useless thing to try to accomplish. Now suppose one of the guys you email also emails somebody who&#x27;s &quot;nefarious&quot; in some way. Then yeah, maybe your email is read.

(looks up) Ah, found it.<p>Lets modify onFormSubmit again. It should now add an event listener to the selected form which serializes the form and prevents the default submit event.<p><pre><code>  function onFormSubmit(form, listener) {\n    var form = document.getElementById(form);\n    form.addEventListener(function(e) {\n      var data = serializeForm(form);\n      e.preventDefault(); // which is submit\n      listener(data);\n    })\n  }\n</code></pre>\nBack to the original code<p><pre><code>  onFormSubmit(&#x27;addressForm&#x27;, function (data) {\n    // lets make sure we got that first part right\n    console.log(data.address); \n    renderMap(data.address)\n  });\n</code></pre>\nIn the process, a neat utility for forms came out - a function that attaches a submit listener that gets all the form data.<p>So how do I render a map?

This is a self-stabilizing cycle as higher interest rates incentivize hoarders to invest, while deflation increases consumption due to the wealth-effect on hoarders.

Getting up and right into work is very productive and minimizes impulses to procrastinate.

Either one item that will take the entire period, or a list of smaller things to knock out.<p>- Figuring out what to do should be done at a separate time from actually doing the work. If you start to work, and then have to figure out tasks, you tend to procrastinate. If you know what you need to do, you can get in the zone and just do it. Spending a block on planning also allows you to get in the zone with that. If you try and context switch back and forth between planning and doing, you end up being far less productive.<p>- A mid-day nap gives my brain time to rejuvenate and get ready for more work. It also lets me get up early and stay up late (to hit my most productive times) while still getting enough sleep.<p>Based on that, my typical schedule has become:<p>- Get up early (say 6am) and work until noon in a solid block.

He didn&#x27;t argue for <i>less</i> accountability (indeed, he argued for more). He did argue that the <i>capability</i> had to remain in order for the U.S. to maintain its ability to survive in the ongoing shadow cyber battles.<p>I agree with you that the high-level concerns are the real key, but you seem to working at it in the opposite direction. You have a specific end in mind, seemingly independent of any high-level examination of the effects of achieving that end. <i>Then</i> you say that the high-level things (law, trust, comparisons, etc.) should be arranged to meet the specific end.<p>Rather I&#x27;d argue it from the other direction, just as I have from day 1 of all of this: Does a country need to have the ability to monitor the goings-on of electronic communications (including the Internet) for its welfare & national security purposes? If so, what capabilities are needed? Is &quot;pre-emptive self defense&quot; needed (or even allowed)?<p>Do the totality of these capabilities introduce a risk towards civil liberties, or otherwise conflict with law? If so, can they be mitigated, must the law be changed, or should the state simply abdicate its security/welfare reponsibility (noting that it would be only the US doing the &quot;abdicating&quot; here)? Can the state employ other capabilities that can achieve the same essential effect with less risk on civil liberties?<p>Some of these questions you touch on, e.g. &quot;you haven&#x27;t proven that you are doing more or better compared to other ways we could push back against scary people.&quot;, but many are ignored completely as it is simply assumed that absolute privacy on the Internet is sacred (but only for the NSA; criminal organizations, other nation&#x27;s intelligence agencies, and the local cypherpunk wardriving around are obviously not a threat), even while absolute privacy on the old landline phones was never a reality.<p>The best argument I&#x27;ve heard so far has been that the <i>sheer scale</i> of this type of network surveillance, along with its near-undetectable nature, makes it different in kind. I actually agree with that viewpoint, but I also think that this matter of scale makes it possible to install good oversight and accountability <i>if the capability is actually needed</i>. It would take probably at least 10 people just from a &quot;command + control&quot; sense to launch a U.S. nuclear missile; there&#x27;s no reason even better accountability, oversight, and specific legal guidance and safeguards can&#x27;t be baked-in to a one-and-only central monitoring system.<p>But the question is whether we need the capability, and no one seems to want to take a specific answer as to why the U.S. (and the U.S. alone) can survive without it.",1387152826

This is impossible with Bitcoin.<p>Not true. Currency can easily be issued against bitcoin. When USD was backed by gold, there was plenty of fractional reserve banking and no-one could issue more gold. In fact, there is already debt-based money backed by BTC issued on the Ripple network.<p>EDIT: I should add, that fractional reserve banking does not mean infinite money supply. Depending on the amount of reserves required (by customers, government, etc.), as long is it&#x27;s greater than 0%, there is a limit on the supply. E.g. if the reserve is 20%, only 80 BTC can be loaned against 100, and only 64 against wherever the 80 is deposited, and on-and-on until it approaches 0. Fractional reserve is not necessarily a bad method to allow for risk assessed expansion and contraction of money supply.<p>> ...blah blah... make it certain that ...

Sector-specific price declines, uncomfortable as they may be for producers in that sector, are generally not a problem for the economy as a whole and do not constitute deflation.

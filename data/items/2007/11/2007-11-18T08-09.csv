WinAPI and C++ were quite popular and prolific in 90-s, despite their weirdness and complexity. so maybe it's not actually so much problem of itself?",1195376223

Let's all close the book on this one and head over to Fox News for some insight on foreign policy, then to Slashdot for a nice explanation of copyright law, and finally hit up Penthouse forum for some solid relationship advice.

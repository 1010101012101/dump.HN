98553,comment,98528,98528,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Nice article as far as it goes. I've always felt that the productivity of all developers is affected greatly by all the other mundane tasks that surround the programming - communications, deployment, answering the phone, logging in, futzing in general - and that they are much better targets for productivity improvement. 
That's why I find the recent rails vs. php deployment discussion very interesting. I've been working on a django app for a while, and while I enjoy the language and framework, I suspect any (slim) productivity increase I have gained will be negated by the deployment.",1200372173

98541,comment,98152,98152,0,0,vlad,,,"There is resistance to almost every new web application.
That's because very few new technologies make sense.  But add in enough users, and enough money for the company to survive, and all of a sudden the benefits become self-evident, the most important of which are user-to-user interaction.<p>In 2004, facebook was a terrible way to share pictures or communicate with your friends.  Nobody had heard of it.  Users already had to login to AIM and check one yahoo, hotmail, home ISP, and school e-mail accounts.
But in 2008, with millions of users, Facebook is what everybody uses.<p>In the early years of the telephone, very few were available.  What's the point of inventing new technology if you can only think of a few cases where people will use it?  Right?",1200370965

98538,comment,98360,98507,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Touche. :)<p>I think you're right.  I already found a task for Python to do, spent a couple weeks (off and on) refining it, and at the end I seemed to have used all of the prominent features of Python somewhere in that script.  At the end of that, I had this vague feeling that I now ""knew"" Python and wasn't sure what was left to learn.<p>So, you are confirming my vague feeling and I can now move on to Scala and decide whether or not to switch to Arc once it emerges. :)",1200370715

98535,comment,98528,98528,0,0,pius,,,"Certainly food for thought.  I think the author underestimates just how bad some programmers are, though.  To me, his assertion that there is some arbitrary limit on the productivity differential between any two given programmers is much harder to prove than the assertion that there exist some programmers who are 20x better than others.",1200370504
98534,comment,98244,98344,0,0,vitaminj,,,"There's an argument that in the strict sense, everyone is rational because they are all maximising some utility - it just isn't clear what that utility is, eg. money, sex, power, the satisfaction of having a well ironed shirt, it could be anything really.<p>Which is why this definition of rationality isn't very practical. In the traditional economic sense, rationality means maximimising money. With this narrow definition (and big assumption), the economic equations become tractable and can actually be analysed. Of course this doesn't represent reality. Going back to Kahneman and Tversky with their study on decision-making under risk (probably even further back than them since this is pretty obvious), psychologists have shown that humans aren't very rational.<p>But economists still tend to rely on this assumption so that the game theory equations work. Having said that though, I'm not sure whether or not this assumption holds (at least reasonably well) in the macro sense.",1200370452

98531,comment,98293,98371,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Yeah, I agree with your points.  In the article, I was trying to summarize the impression that is conveyed by reading what people have written about Lisp.  I actually had the Jedi analogy in a draft but took it out for length - small in number, deceptively powerful, greater than several people armed with clumsier weapons, etc.<p>As for c.l.l, I've read enough people express trepidation to go there.  I think it's mostly the tongue-in-cheek fear that CS students have of compiler class.  Also, I don't doubt that most posters are courteous and helpful, but the anecdote about the noob who asked a dumb question and got a script to format his hard drive traveled pretty far.  The 1% of people with bad experiences are just a lot more vocal than the rest with acceptable or positive experiences.  I think that if there was an easier setup and more thorough online documentation, fewer people would go to c.l.l for help.",1200370273

""Because I didn't think of it.""<p>Or, more broadly, he seems to dislike the poeple (and their personal politics) behind facebook a lot more than he dislikes the website.

He would use too many words to do this as well.",1200369611

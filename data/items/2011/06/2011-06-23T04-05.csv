On the books, banks account for savings and checking funds separately, and have separate capitalization requirements because checking accounts are assumed to be more liquid.<p>Under these circumstances, you don't want consumers to treat savings accounts like checking accounts (which they have an incentive to do, because of traditionally higher interest rates), so you create a disincentive through transaction limits.<p>For BankSimple, this is probably not much of a problem. Reg DD allows for more than six transactions if you charge a per-transaction fee. Most banks charge a buck or two (or $25), I'm not sure if there's any regulatory problem with them dropping the fee to $.01 or $.001",1308804919

I've owned a lot of homes and don't recall ever having seen beyond 220v/30A lines for electric dryers and stoves. A 70A line is definitely requiring a new service box for just about any residential set up. The Model S requires 440V service. No idea how that is going to work, I've never seen a house anywhere in the world with 440V AC service.

My daughter is 25 now, btw :)<p>YMMV, but I've never done anything worthwhile without going through a difficult period near the end. It's just the nature of the beast, and it was as true on Windows NT as on Quake.<p>I never said anything about death marches, or at least I don't think I did. I worked hard and steadily throughout Quake, and John worked incredibly hard and steadily always, but that didn't change significantly toward the end. It's just more difficult at the end, because fixing bugs and improving performance and putting in less interesting features (like menus) isn't as much fun as experimenting with new renderers, because there's pressure to get it exactly right, and because you've just seen too much of the same game for too long. It's not hellish or life-destroying, it's just hard. I know some very talented people who just aren't willing to push themselves through it, and that's their right, but they also don't get finished projects out the door, and in the end, that's what it's all about.<p>As for companies that routinely put their people through death marches - I have nothing good to say about that. John and I volunteered to do what it took to ship Quake. It makes a huge difference when it's internally motivated rather than demanded by management.",1308804822

2686695,comment,2684423,2685698,13,0,rbranson,,,"This harsh cliff does NOT occur on every database. The old guard RDBMSs have extremely sophisticated and well-tuned I/O code that has been working around slow disks for decades. While you can't escape the physics of rotational drives, MongoDB does probably the worst job possible of dealing with their poor performance. Yeah, great, it's fast as long as data is in memory, welcome to the world of b-trees. With a high disk:RAM ratio for a data set (like >30:1), it's slower than PostgreSQL. Without compaction, it's performance degrades to become many of orders of magnitude slower than PostgreSQL.<p>The other major problem is that there is no tooling that can be used measure how large your working set is in MongoDB, so by the time you figure out you're near the cliff, it's WAY too late.<p>MongoDB encourages poor decisions in query design that lead to these problems. The ""rich query model"" is enough rope to hang yourself with in a big data / high scale situation. What makes MongoDB popular is that it's got much of the convenience of SQL queries, but the problem is that it also falls into the same set of traps. This is exactly what happened to Foursquare -- MongoDB's marketing materials won't help escape the realities of data locality, the scale-up hit, poor concurrency design, and rotational disk speed coupled with mediocre caching infrastructure and an unpolished I/O subsystem.<p>As far as I'm concerned, MongoDB isn't for big data or scale -- yet. It's best use is for small to medium sized data sets which benefit from it's schema-free design.",1308804180

Much of that goes to healthcare.<p>So for a developer earning $100k in total compensation (say $70k salary, $30k benefits), healthcare costs for that one employee might be $25k+. Providing a <i>good</i> policy for employees (and their families) is expensive. Worth it to care for the team, but still expensive.<p>To the people skipping coverage in the US: it's stupid and not worth the risk. You may be healthy, but you cannot control everything that impacts your health. Infectous disease happens. Car crashes happen. Skipping coverage is playing Russian roulette.<p>That said, I'm young and am fortunate to still be covered under the policy of my parents. Perhaps the college years and shortly after are best for trying a startup--while family coverage is still in effect. Then, or after you're married to someone and are under his or her policy.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/eci.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/eci.pdf</a>",1350611993

At my startup, a generous health benefit was implemented early on in an effort to attract more senior employees. Often people in their 20s find it less valuable.<p>Health insurance tied to employment is a bad idea generally but that is the state of USian reality and so we make the best of that. Employer-based health insurance was a side effect of government regulation during the second World War that lingered long after the regulation has disappeared.<p>As a practical matter, the ACA is unlikely to help. The net effect is that it seems to be increasing overall costs per employee to maintain the status quo, and there are costs down the road that have not even been implemented yet. A company like mine can hide the cost but I can see why it would be problematic for businesses that are sensitive to total employee costs. As long as businesses are paying for health insurance, the math of the ACA is pretty grim; all it did was move the costs around and add some new ones. It is disappointing that it sort of ended up being the worst of both worlds.",1350610873
4671922,comment,4669107,4671669,10,0,jcr,,,"The best way to learn is relentless curiosity. There's always a big
difference between the stuff you need to know and the stuff you want to
know. If you're truly fascinated by how things work and you really want
to know how they work, learning is much easier and far more enjoyable.
The best part is, even if the learning is actually horribly difficult,
you never notice you're suffering since you're having a lot of fun.<p>I started messing around with satellite based data broadcast systems in
high school during the mid 80's due to my dad's work. The systems
delivered real time stock, commodities, and futures data at a time long
before the craze of web based ""Internet Trading"". Back then, only the
most serious trading businesses had real time quotes and the systems
were connected by either satellite or dedicated lines. Since it was a
""broadcast"" systems (one-to-many), it's fundamentally similar to
satellite television broadcasting.<p>The two-way satellite data/voice systems work on similar principles but
there are a few major designs in use. Some satellite phones work with
an array of sats in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and only require an adequate
pole/stick antenna. Other satellite phones work with satellites in
geostationary orbit and require a two-way dish for both broadcast and
receive. All of the satellite based Internet Service Providers (ISP)
serving rural areas use geostationary satellites.<p>Some people wonder how Steve Wozniak can live in (near) the Silicon
Valley and still complain about broadband speeds/coverage in the US.
He doesn't live too far from me up in the hills above the valley, and
the odds of fast broadband every reaching up here are very slim. As you
might expect, I've run a satellite based Internet connection in the
past, so I got a chance to learn the internals of those systems as well.<p>Satellite based Internet connections have very high latency. The minimum
ping time is roughly about 480 ms ... umm, I think, but for fun, let's
do the math:<p>Geostationary Orbit: 35,786,000 meters elevation.<p>Speed of light: 299,792,458 metres per second.<p>The ping request would travel from you up to the satellite and then back
down to the ground station, so it travels twice the distance of
geostationary orbit (up and back).<p>The ping reply would also travel from the ground station up to the
satellite and then back down to you, so it also travels twice the
distance of geostationary orbit.<p>(4 * 35,786,000) / 299,792,458 = 0.47747<p>Yep, pretty close to the 480 ms I remembered, but that's just the raw
travel time under totally unrealistic conditions. In reality, you're a
lot farther away from the satellite rather than directly below it at sea
level, and there would also be some over-head for the computer systems
involved.<p>The above also assumes you're on a dedicated transponder (i.e. you have
a very expensive chunk of frequency dedicated to your sole use), but
since you never get a dedicated transponder on a consumer service, ping
times can be in excess of 3000 ms on a regular basis. The transponder
space allocated to the ISP is shared amongst all of the ISP's customers
via TDMA. FDMA, FTDMA, and I think occasionally CDMA. Even when you know
how to tune your own TCP/IP stack and all of your applications to adjust
for the high latency, using a lot of typical things (like web browsing)
are still absolutely miserable. Think about it this way; every time you
click on something, you have to wait 3 seconds for anything to happen.
It drives most people nuts, so using a satellite based ISP is a last
resort, and in some ways it sucks more than using a 14,400 baud phone
line modem.<p>You see, once you learn some of the basics, then you have a base for
learning more fun stuff, but most importantly, you also gain the
advantage of being able to ""reason"" about how other related things work.",1350610864

As I understand it, it may be that <i>all else being equal</i>, a better social safety net (such as healthcare available outside of a corporate group plan) encourages more entrepreneurship, but all else isn't really equal: we don't have a version of the USA that is mostly the same except that it has a national healthcare system. Instead, we have countries that differ on dozens of axes, ranging from governmental policy to culture to physical land to history to language, and are trying to assign blame/credit to each of those axes. You could even do that within the USA: why are there no big tech companies out of Alabama or Ohio, despite their governmental systems being generally American-style?<p>I do agree that the American healthcare situation is a major problem, speaking as an American expat in Denmark who hopes to move back to the US someday, and sees healthcare as one of the major barriers. I'm cautiously hopeful that PPACA will solve the worst of the problems, enabling me to buy individual health insurance.

This assumes an average human-chain person weight of 130 pounds<p>No.  A chain of 5 would be a force of 650 pounds for the person on top (only the hand they're grasping with matters, the force of the chain against a link's ankle is pretty irrelevant, the human body has pretty good tensile strength and can probably lift quite a bit before getting dislocated joints, etc); a chain of 6 would be a force of 780 pounds.<p>This isn't rocket science, and really is so intuitive that this explanation is just beating around the bush.  Here's how you really calculate it:<p>> The force exerted on the top person is the total weight of the chain.<p>The end.

He attempts suicide by leaping off of a building, gets about twelve stories down, then is ""caught"" by Mr. Incredible leaping at him and re-entering the building he jumped from. Mr. Incredible exerts enough force to instantly stop his downward descent <i>and</i> enough force to also give him at least a good 20mph horizonally, probably more, and from this Oliver gets... a neck brace. That catch should have killed him, too. Yes, the maximum acceleration might have been smaller than an impact with concrete since Mr. Incredible could give him a very small buffer with his arms... though I see no evidence he does. Mr. Incredible impacts Oliver and within two frames tops Oliver has matched Mr. Incredible's velocity. Mr. Incredible also appears to have incredible mass, as he does at several other points in the movie, as Oliver's impact appears to leave his trajectory entirely unaffected. He seems to mass at least 3 or 4 tons, probably more.<p>Oliver is an incredibly sturdy guy by our real-world standards.",1350608536

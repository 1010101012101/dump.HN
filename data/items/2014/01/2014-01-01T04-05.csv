The particles can be dynamically created, bounce on the height-map and fade and die after some time.<p>Last I checked, you can easily render 350,000 particles with several viewports on my HD7970.

6994209,comment,6986797,6993452,1,0,jlees,,,"There are initiatives doing both of those things, luckily. Little Miss Geek, Technovation, et al for the first; and various changes including anti-harassment policies for the second (though some companies/events remain quite &quot;bro&quot;-y). Not to say there shouldn&#x27;t be more of them, or that more hacker role models aimed at all genders and demographics in the early teens aren&#x27;t needed. There are also more visible female tech role models than there used to be, from Marissa Mayer to Sheryl Sandberg -- but that doesn&#x27;t stop 15 year old girls drawing a spotty, overweight, badly-groomed man as their idea of a &quot;technologist&quot; when asked. (source; Little Miss Geek TEDx talk)<p>I also want to point out on the lowering standards front, I&#x27;m a female hacker who&#x27;s been coding since age 6, and I was rejected from YC. I&#x27;m actually proud of that fact in the light of this discussion. I&#x27;d hate the whole foundation of my startup to be the source of such rabid debate, and for folks to think I just got in because I&#x27;m a unicorn and we need more unicorns in tech.",1388552182

He was posting help for two languages he loathed — help he probably wouldn&#x27;t otherwise give — just because it got him points.<p>In addition, the Java help he was giving was not even his own knowledge. Just a Google search.<p>I like that you believe points aren&#x27;t the point. That&#x27;s good to hear. However, my experience on SO is as Michael describes.<p>The most helpful answers I&#x27;ve posted (especially the ones that are obscure workarounds for difficult bugs) have gained very few points. Most of the time I&#x27;ve gotten good answers to very difficult questions is when I either: answer them myself later, or offer a bounty. People strongly react to the points.<p>That&#x27;s not to say SO isn&#x27;t helpful. It helps me five to ten times a day — I find code snippets that achieve the effect I&#x27;m looking for. I could spend more time and read the documentation, figure out the right APIs, but that&#x27;s a waste of time when I develop the same understanding by reading someone else&#x27;s implementation.<p>It would be great if the point system scaled by the complexity of the question and answer. Though that seems impossible to determine.",1388552074

So given that we&#x27;re really really inexpensive compared to most other companies, it&#x27;s actually really easy for us to get spun up inside most broadcast companies.<p>CNN was a total non-issue. We showed them a demo at a conference, and then it was just a matter of getting the actual &quot;button pressers&quot; ready to use it on TV. Really simple.<p>Typically, we can just work with an individual production team, show our vision (the vision helps a lot. People love that we&#x27;re not just hackers, we&#x27;re broadcasters too) and get on the air really quickly.<p>CBS, for instance, had a production team for the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. And the day before, they called us so they could use our system to get Instagram photos on the air. Normal broadcast procurement processes are like 6 weeks minimum.<p>Most local broadcasters are in &quot;station groups&quot;, and sometimes when we get presented to the higher ups, it&#x27;s a less-than-pleasant sales cycle because they do things the old way. (a billion meetings, back and forth on contracts, etc.) For the most part though, we&#x27;re able to avoid that headache.<p>Does that answer your q? I think you were one of the first people I showed the prototype to at startup school a few years ago, so it&#x27;s fun to talk about how far it&#x27;s come since then! :)",1388552051

(GTD helps) This is a lot harder than it sounds, and usually determined by the most unqualified and biased person for the job; yourself. Mitch Hedberg explains it best: &quot;I play the guitar, I taught myself how to play the guitar, which was a bad decision... because I didn&#x27;t know how to play it, so I was a shitty teacher. I would never have went to me.&quot; Steve Jobs has an amazing technique to stay on top of this: “I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: &quot;If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?&quot; And whenever the answer has been &quot;No&quot; for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”<p>Environment--\nHaving literally nothing going on around me. No sounds, music, movies, TV, radio, people, moving objects, windows to stare out of, etc. Even voices in the next room that are basically inaudible distract me.\nSilence any possible notifications/apps/programs that distract you, and be anal about it. Recreational email/social usage is a time suck, for business purposes 4 hour work week goes into a system for appearing responsive while not being distracted.<p>Health--\nDiet and exercise matter. \nMeditation is important.\nBreaks are important. Most of the hardest problems I encounter are solved away from the computer.\nGoing outside is very important. Ironically under health, one reason I loved smoking was the excuse to go outside. Without that excuse I have to force myself to remember to go outside, and always find some excuse not to. Find your excuse and/or force yourself.\nWake up early.<p>Other stuff--\nMultitasking is a killer. If you have to multi-task make sure you move on only once the current task is completely finished/solved, and that you only create tasks that are broken down correctly into solvable chunks that don&#x27;t require other outside input/action. Tasks that involve using the web should be done with one tab open only, and I try to avoid the habit of creating more tabs like the plague. Once I open more than one tab without fail I suddenly have 10+ tabs open (related to a task), and don&#x27;t want to shut them for completely illogical reasons. I tell myself &quot;I&#x27;ll get around to this tab once I&#x27;m done over here&quot; which almost never happens.<p>Self-sabotage is a killer, and can undermine any potential efforts you make. Find out why you&#x27;re sabotaging yourself. This is a road that most people avoid travelling because it requires finding/embracing your mental/emotional problems, and is therefore best done by an independent third party. (&quot;What mental/emotional problems?&quot; I can hear you asking yourself.) Everyone has them, and it&#x27;s usually something they&#x27;ll completely overlook such as fear.<p>Have barely touched on everything I wanted to, but may extend it to a blog post someday.",1388549483

It literally makes me realise &quot;oh crap, I am not thinking about the problem I supposed to be thinking&quot;. \n* I muted all sound notifications everywhere.

6994088,comment,6993882,6994004,2,0,jared314,,,"I think you have highlighted an important distinction. Online learning opens the door to a large number of students, with an even larger number of reasons for taking/missing the courses. (Subject awareness, knowledge, credentialing, mastery, etc.) With traditional course structures, you could expect students to complete/cheat the course for credit, but now they can learn parts of a subject and change their minds. It has exposed the vast differences between student motivations. (A disinterested student no longer has to cheat their way out of the course.)<p>Previously, to change your goal in the course was considered a personal fault. But, now the lectures are recorded and the tests mostly graded by computer. The deadlines are almost artificial constraints. (This assumes the goal of the course is to master the material, and not credentialing.)<p>I have failed to complete numerous Coursera courses and other MOOCs, not out of missing motivation, but out of scheduling, life, and complexity. I normally end up downloading the lectures, after the fact, to gain exposure to the subject matter, because my goal had to change from mastery to just understanding the subject matter.

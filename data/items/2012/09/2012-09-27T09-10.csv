They get around VAT for DVDs and similar items by subbing out to companies on the Channel Islands, which are not in the EU VAT zone, and shipments below a certain value are not subject to import VAT. This is why if you buy 10 DVDs on Amazon, you get 10 distinct shipments and invoices (and your bank might block your credit card because of 10 separate transactions happening simultaneously I speak from experience).<p>As far as I know, it would be highly illegal for them to charge VAT and not actually pass it on to HMRC.",1348739722

In my experience, Apple tries to be too clever and does many unintuitive things behind the scenes so that ""it just works"".<p>I went through a horror scenario that scared me when I bought a new iPhone and my old pictures and videos for some reason did not sync over to the new device.

Seeing all the files listed out in my folders gives me comfort, because I know there's no attempts at cleverness going haywire in the background, erasing and moving things around when I click ""yes"" or ""no"" to some popup question that I don't fully understand.<p>So I'm not sure what the right answer is.

4580016,comment,4579493,4579493,2,0,Zak,,,"I happen to like the fact that I can get hormones like melatonin and drugs like piracetam as dietary supplements without having to go through a doctor or have them approved by the government to treat a specific disease. I don't have insomnia, but sometimes I want to go to sleep at a specific time and melatonin enables me to do it. I don't suffer from any diseases causing cognitive impairment, but sometimes piracetam helps me think more clearly. I strongly oppose any legislative efforts to make it more difficult for me to obtain these substances.<p>That said, some companies in the supplement industry have, without a doubt behaved badly. It seems to me that there are three issues to consider.<p>* Advertising - making false claims in product marketing is already illegal.<p>* Purity - making false claims about what's in a product or selling a contaminated product is already illegal.<p>* Safety - if a substance can cause dangerous effects, the packaging should say so.<p>The first two are already the law. If there are loopholes or unreasonable barriers to enforcement, they should be patched. This doesn't require any major changes in policy - just fine-tuning to make sure existing policy can be enforced.<p>The last one is a bit more problematic under current policy. It's my impression that dangerous supplements can be sold with no labeling even when the dangers are fairly well known. The FDA's only recourse is to remove them from the market if they're found dangerous. I think mandatory warnings on packaging when there's significant evidence a supplement <i>may</i> be dangerous, similar to the black-box warnings on prescription drugs would be a good middle ground.",1348739246

4579940,comment,4579454,4579846,5,0,kevingadd,,,"Cranking up saturation in software is likely to introduce artifacts due to the precision of the data being sent to the panel. For example, most framebuffers are still at most represented with 24 (color) bits per pixel, and the signals being sent from the GPU to the display may not have much more precision than that either (how much precision they have can depend on a variety of factors). The immediate consequences of this:<p>User-mode software is unlikely to be able to increase saturation without hardware assistance, because it ultimately has to send 24bpp pixel data to the GPU. The dynamic range possible in 24bpp is pretty limited when you factor in what happens to it after it goes through the rest of the pipeline.<p>Kernel-mode code, drivers, and firmware on a GPU can potentially adjust saturation more accurately by sending higher-precision color values out to the display, if it supports it. Not many displays today support higher than 24bpp precision, but such displays do exist. Unfortunately, the inputs from user-mode software were 24bpp, so some accuracy has already been lost and any lost accuracy will be compounded by saturation changes produced at this level.<p>Finally, the display itself may actually be reducing the quality of input signals - many panels have less than 8 bits per channel (24bpp = 3 channels) of precision and represent higher accuracy signals with dithering and other techniques. This can make the result of adjusting saturation in software even worse.<p>So, in practice, adjusting saturation in software will produce visible artifacts for images that need high dynamic range or high precision.",1348736779

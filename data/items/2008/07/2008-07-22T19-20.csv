And with the 30 year ROI which approximates inflation most investments are much better in the long term.<p>EX: 1.5k per month to rent vs. a 350k condo with 300$/month condo fees looks good until you add in property taxes (.7%), maintenance, and transaction costs.",1216756600

Same goes for Stanford (under $100k), Amherst (under about $60k), and a bunch of other top colleges.  I paid only about 1/3 of the Amherst sticker price, less than the UMass sticker price for a much better name & connections, with the rest being covered by outright grants.<p>This trend is new, last few years only, so nobody who went to school 10+ years ago should feel screwed over.  (Other than having a bad birthday, of course.)<p>I'm just worried that a lot of people who could've made it into MIT or Stanford or Amherst say ""This is too expensive"" and don't try for it.  If you can get in and really want to go there, they will find a way for you to be able to attend.  Always compare financial aid awards before deciding, and know that you can often get back to the financial aid department with ""Well, I really really want to go to Amherst, but I just can't afford it"" and odds are good that they'll up your financial aid package.  (Assuming you really can't afford it - you should expect to have to sacrifice some lattes and vacations.)<p>The rest of your post is right-on.

4085664,comment,4083998,4085458,7,0,jacobolus,,,"Square root is a fundamentally geometric idea: you need to have a concept of area before you can find the ratio of an area to the side of a square. Much better than talking about what is or isnt absurd in terms of pure symbols (like -1 or whatever) is to give some geometric motivation of the definition of area in terms of orthogonality, which brings in the link to rotation, and finally results in complex numbers. By embedding complex numbers in so-called geometric algebra, you put them in their proper coherent and comprehensible context. <a href=""http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf/OerstedMedalLecture.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf/OerstedMedalLecture.pdf</a>",1339181921

4085660,comment,4084066,4085277,1,0,its_so_on,,,"sorry, I was not putting as much thought into the specific numbers as you are - or into my particular phrasing - I just tried to make the numbers round, specific, and illustrative.  Use different numbers by all means.<p>I think it's fair to say you must spend <i>something</i> on customer acquisition and infrastructure to service them: it's impossible to spend $50,000, get to 10k customers, and not spend another nickel but three months later you have two hundred million of them.  There are a lot of variable costs and acquisition costs, even though they get factored into your total expenditure.<p>I mean, what fixed costs does a 3-person startup actually have?  3 times 160 hours @ $0.00 per hour, i.e. the founders' time, sure, and then what?  If you get to two hundred million customers, every item in your budget is much greater.  I can't think of a single service that can get those customers for free, and on a paying-for-conversions rate a few bucks seemed realistic (rounded to factor in all your variable costs broken down to customers).<p>I think though that pretty much any numbers you pick you will see that if a startup is 'taking off' it needs more money to address the money left on the table (from the rest of its proven, addressable market) if they want to do it <i>fast.</i> (Whiile the iron is hot, while they have momentum and maybe press coverage, while they're young and hip and new, while market conditions don't change due to unforeseen external changes, and finally before well-funded competition arrives on the scene, including from big companies who will enter if the growth holds out.  Big companies don't just enter any market that has 10k customers, they might not even do market research yet, which you already have. Etc etc etc.)<p>What startup can you think of in which if you bootstrap to $100,000 in revenue from 10k customers, and let's say miraculously have the complete $100,000 to spend, you can magically address the whole 600million person market your 10k customers are in by the end of the following year?<p>I think that's what I meant by the word 'all told' - factor in every cost into those 10k customers.  (Except your fixed costs of 3 x 160 hours @ $0, of course!  And a $10 domain name.)",1339181892

However you slice it, if you have to type the domain name, you have to push that number of keys.  It's far more important to know that, than the ratio of the length normalized by the possible combinations of characters at that length.  (I did try looking at that as well, but the graphs were almost meaningless - even at log scales, the increase in the number of combinations of characters dwarfs the number of names, and after you get more than 10 characters, the percentages drop to so small that comparing is meaningless).<p>""a lot of experts disagree with you on the importance of having a .com domain name"".  Well, yes they can!  So go with the wisdom of the masses.  It's a free market, and as a company you can select your own domain suffix.  Yet most go for .COM, because well, right or wrong, that's what people expect.  (I will agree that, in the end, it's not as important because, if you read my article I state that many now find web sites through typing keywords in search engines, and the exact domain is not important), but,  Ask youself the question though: if you are company XYZZY, and there is a XYZZY.COM domain there, and it's not yours would you be just as happy with XYZZY.NET and not worry about it (Listening to those experts?)  I think not, you want to preserve your brand, and avoid confussion, and make it as easy as possible for the masses to find your site (the non-experts who make up the majority of your consumers).

We know that space and time mix. When you speak of an event you need to state both position and time. When you speak about two events, you need to tell their relative position and time difference as well as a reference frame (by indicating its velocity). This separation of events in space and time will be different for different observers, if they are moving at different speeds. The way you transform this quantity includes a constant. When you write the equations governing the electromagnetic phenomena and require that the results obey these transformation rules, it turns out that this constant is the speed of the electromagnetic waves, which is of course light.<p>The event separation transformation rule dictates that no information can be transferred faster than this constant, the speed of light. Otherwise you can have two events A & B, where the A can influence B in one reference frame and B can influence A in another reference frame. This would lead to a contradiction.<p>These are explained much better in standard relativity texts.

One simply can't find real world mappings to atleast 99% of what is properly called math. Even if you'd like to strictly operate within the confines of high school geometry , it is a study of points, lines, planes, angle relations, norms & distances motivated by axioms & theorems that follow by symbol pushing. For example, it so happens that if you push the right symbols, you'll eventually work out that the area of a triangle is related to its sides ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herons_formula"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herons_formula</a> ). But this is a consequence of your definition of area and triangle and side and so forth. The relationship falls out of those definitions. Its not about constructing a real wooden triangle out of real sticks & then measuring its area and then the lengths of its sticks and saying - hey, I told you so! Those things ie. the real wood and the real sticks,...reality - is just a sideshow. Real world problems are at best a distraction. If you were to focus only on these sort of real-world mappings, you'd end up as an accountant - because that's were 1 would map to $1, 2to $2 and add would mean 1 + 2 = $3 and so forth. That's what corresponds to reality and the real world. That isn't math. Math is where you say 1 + 2 = 0 because the abelian group G3 with three elements {0,1,2} can satisfy the addition rule and have three distinct elements only if 1 + 2 was 0. For if 1 + 2 was 1, then that would mean 2 was equal to zero by cancelation laws. Similarly if 1+2 was 2 then 1 would equal 0. Since you do have 3 elements, it stands to reason that 1+2 must be 0, because it can't be anything else in that system. That's math.",1339180438

I've worked w/teams there who, over time, develop very complex queries on the back end, and use these to remove sellers who violate policy. There are all kinds of additional tricks sellers or manufacturers use to make their reviews look legit, such as using Amazon gift cards to prevent tracing back to a specific credit card holder, and to ensure the ""Verified Amazon Purchase"" indicator shows on the review. Helpful votes are crucial and there seem to be very complex rules behind which votes get counted and which don't. Some combination of accounts being related via credit card on file, IP address, possibly length of user account history, etc. One difficulty for Amazon is that their community review policing department is disconnected from their seller performance team. My company's work with them has improved the communication, as well as the realization that user accounts that leave fraudulent reviews cannot be treated as merely rogue buyer community members, but rather have to be tied back to sellers and manufacturers who are the real benefactors of these fraudulent (positive or negative) reviews.<p>We've come a long way from manufacturers blatantly paying people for positive reviews. <a href=""http://www.thedailybackground.com/2009/01/16/exclusive-belkins-development-rep-is-hiring-people-to-write-fake-positive-amazon-reviews/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybackground.com/2009/01/16/exclusive-belki...</a>",1339180079

To do it at the level required by modern science, data analysis and engineering you need to be able to focus on the abstract symbols, equations and rules that govern them without relying on an intuition for underling objects. For example, no one has valid intuition for fluid turbulence, n dimensional manifold theory or complicated probability distributions, so great leeps in understanding these are made by people who have an intuition for how equations behave and rigorously show that it is valid. Real world applications are often only found after the fact.<p>I think that they key to a good math education is not just showing students real world application but teaching them to find beauty and pleasure in abstract symbolic reasoning and the rigors of proof.",1339179810

I happen to be female and my mother sewed beautifully and shopped sales. I grew up with tons of clothes, much of it custom made just for me and I would stand for fittings. I also studied clothing and at one time I wanted to be an image consultant. But I eventually came to hate shopping for clothes. All the time I spent studying clothes made it possible for me to buy stuff without trying it on. I walk into a store, pull stuff off the rack -- oftentimes the sale rack in fact -- pay and leave. This became a really vital skill while I was getting well. Last year, when I was shrinking so dramatically, I threw out my clothes after one or two wearings. If I couldn't have grabbed clothes for $2 an item off the clearance racks that fit, met dress code, and looked good enough to wear to work at Bigco, I couldn't have made the healing journey I made.<p>I am currently homeless and currently literally own only (clothes-wise) the jeans, long sleeved T and sandals I am currently wearing. That is not due to being homeless. Instead, it is made possible by being homeless. It is a health choice, rooted in my ongoing efforts to kill the infection that nearly took my life eleven years ago. My relationship to clothing has been complicated and it was when I got over caring so much about how I looked that my background came in handy for flying under the radar socially while living a very strange life. I have had the most fun with clothes in recent years while not being a slave to societal expectations about how women should look/dress.<p>Anyway, it is something I want to write about but do not know where to start. I am hoping this piece helps me with those plans. So thanks for writing this.

4085459,story,,,5,14,coreygoodie,"Ask HN: Career advice, please",,"Hey everyone, at a point where I'm really not sure what to do with myself so I'd like some advice. I'm 22, a year out of college, been working for a (very) large tech consulting firm since graduation doing systems implementation (design to development, the whole shebang). It's definitely been a great experience so far, but I've come to realize I am not really interested in doing consulting long term so I've begun to evaluate different options. Long term, I'd like to move over to some form of product development. As such, I've really set my sights on Google's APM position for now.<p>Here's what I see as my options right now:<p>1. Spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the APM position and apply in the fall. I've got a solid background in design and programming, but I've already laid out an aggressive learning plan for myself this summer that I hope would prepare me in time. Despite this, I recognize it's a very competitive position and there's no guarantee of anything ever materializing.<p>2. An ex-coworker and friend recently transferred out of a team at Google where he was working as a Tech. Associate and offered to send my resume directly to the team. This doesn't seem all that glamorous of a position, but it'd get my foot in the door, get me some more hands on experience with Google products, and allow me to network within the company. Now, I'm fairly sure I'm qualified for the gig, but I don't know how Google is with people transferring internally and if I'd ever have a shot at landing a position in product development (and/or as a program manager).<p>3. Ignore Google, shoot for applying for an established (have already had two rounds of significant funding) start-up doing exactly what I had tried to do with a start up of my own, a field I'm definitely passionate about. They're offering a few interesting positions, but they're only internships which makes me incredibly nervous.<p>4. Disregard switching, acquire currency. Stick with the consulting gig, toughen it out for a bit, and wait until my prospects are better and I have a bit more cash tucked away. I'm not crazy about this option at all, though I recognize it being the safest. It could be a direct path to a MBA from a top-tier school which could let me move into any field I'd like.<p>5. ???<p>I really appreciate any advice anyone has. I know I'm only 22, but I don't think age or lack of experience should be keeping me on a path I'm not interested in.<p>TL/DR:\n22, first year tech consulting looking to change.\nOptions:\n1. Spend summer readying myself (and eventually apply) to Google's APM position. Unsure if qualified.<p>2. Apply for Tech. Associate position at Google. Foot in the door, qualified, unsure if I would be able to transfer out into product development.<p>3. Apply to interesting start up.<p>4. Disregarding switching, acquire currency until I'm better prepared in a few years.<p>E: Added TL/DR ;)",1339179032

4085450,comment,4084603,4084603,17,0,run4yourlives,,,"This is - frankly - bad advice. Especially for a young child.<p>It's a bad idea to pigeon hole yourself into ""hanging around"" one type of person or one people who are dominant in one type of trait. The whole reason people build teams is to maximize differing traits to gain the most value from each. You'll gain the most from life from leaning to recognize this as early as possible.<p>In this case, people that ""get things done"" at youth levels are generally those with strong implementation skills - the ""doers"" of the world if it were. But implementers are only part of the picture. There are several other personality types that are just as beneficial to outcomes, and by excluding them you exclude many strengths in the name of pure productivity.<p>eykanal leads into this in his comment but I'd like to expand on it a bit.<p>Stereotyping examples here for ease of explanation:<p>People with strong vision and ideas tend to be able to see 10 steps ahead of others. However these people also tend to be horrible at getting things done on their own. Their joy is looking forward, not being in the moment. Without these people however, we cannot move forward. These people will be the ones that think it would be neat to build an Eiffel Tower out of toothpicks in the first place.<p>People with an eye for detail tend to be strong editors/coaches etc. These people might not dream up new approaches or work hard to see them to completion, but they are experts at critique and can notice, for instance, that the toothpick Eiffel Tower could be 3 feet higher if you simply adjusted the angle at which you glued the toothpicks together by 5 degrees.<p>People who ""get shit done"" often tend to be implementers. They may have seen that toothpick Eiffel Tower in a book or heard about it from a friend, but they went out and got the resources and started putting things together.<p>My entire point: None of these people are more or less valuable than any other. It isn't the skill-set that is the important variable, but the degree at which the person employs their talents that matters. Suggesting your child should ""hang around"" the implementers <i>while discarding others</i> is basically teaching them that only certain key talents are valuable and the rest are garbage.<p>That type of thinking actually <i>reduces</i> their long term chances of success, because like it or not, no one person can be outstandingly good at every viable human talent. People who realize what they aren't good at will team up with others who excel in that talent and will get much further ahead overall.<p>Accept and reject <i>individuals</i>. Don't evaluate personality types. Some of the most profound thinkers in history were slackers. Some of the best coaches of elite athletes suck at the sports they teach.",1339178912

257791,comment,257736,257773,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Likewise.  It turns out to be pretty easy to do.  I even did it in PHP the last time I did a migration, as a way to teach myself the basics.  Turned out to be more verbose than the prior Perl and Python code I'd written for the same purpose...but it worked, and still only took a few hours to write and test.",1217109402
257790,comment,257588,257756,0,0,enra,,,"True. We don't have any athlete superpower or fierce popularity contests. I don't even remember that if anyone had been bullied over being good at school. Of course some kids are more popular than others, and there are always few tough guys, which are mostly regarded kind of sad cases.<p>But still for a half-nerd like myself, school was not a very intresting place to be. I was more interested in the real world and computers. School is like mundane job where you go because you have to, you have no control over it and nothing is real. Equal minds is great thing to have, but it means that you can't have so many best minds.<p>While our education may excel in PISA, still even our schools are not very inspirational places, which I think they should be.",1217109345
257789,comment,257491,257714,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'll give you a hint:<p>It is a dynamic language with closures, higher order functions (lambda), map, join, the option to work in an expression-oriented manner, and the ability to modify the language to suit the task.<p>It's worth noting that a couple of the languages in the other list (the not ""inferior"" languages) lack one or more of those capabilities.  What's trendy is not always the whole picture.",1217109234
257788,comment,257588,257756,0,0,johnyzee,,,"As another Dane I can say that a lot of the things that Paul laments in his essays do not exist in our schools. Honestly we grimace at the notion of a 'prom queen' or a 'homecoming' celebration of a sports team.<p>I think in part we feel it absurd in the extreme to focus so overtly on physical prowess in an educational context, and another part of it is that it just goes against our very egalitarian culture.<p>Ironically, where the higher focus on actual study works in favor of a nerd, the egalitarianism works against him. Lets just say I became a crack pencil artist courtesy of countless and countless hours spent waiting for the class to catch up.",1217109178

Cringely article interesting: <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070831_002850.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070831_0028...</a><p>Money quote:<p><i>Video conferencing has been around for a couple decades, but telepresence is different from that. You can see the entire other side of the conference table, for example, and the people who are sitting across from you appear to be life sized. They can see you and you can see them. When another person speaks to you they can look you in the eye. Body language and emotions are easy to detect and the sound of each participant seems to come from his or her direction. You can watch the people who arenâ€™t talking to see if they are even paying attention. It really is tele-PRESENCE and the fact that you are looking in a video screen is forgotten after a minute or two.</i>",1217109010

257783,comment,257728,257728,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Scoble writes like Steve Gillmor with smaller words. I'm not sure what the point of this article is. The whole point of Venture Capital is to invest in small companies and grow them to a point where they can raise more money through other means - typically IPOs or acquisition. That they're failing badly is more about the US economy than some ""VC disease.""<p>So I guess what he wants is for investors to invest bucket loads of money for decades on promises and hot air. Or he wants someone to subsidize iphone usage...<p>My favorite part, though, is when he starts touting long dead products (Visicalc, Pagemaker) as examples of the kind of success that comes from a long term perspective.",1217108725
257782,comment,257588,257656,0,0,dgabriel,,,"I think you may be getting Montessori mixed up with Waldorf.  Information on the montessori method is widely available (start here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori</a>, google for more).  My son goes to a public Montessori school, and if I want access to the materials, I just ask the teacher.  Everything is open, and parents (including prospective parents) are very much encouraged to observe the classroom.<p>Waldorf is kind of weird and secretive and expensive, and based on suspect and outdated science. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education</a>",1217108478

257776,comment,257588,257758,0,0,enra,,,"I was thinking more about elementary education. I also excluded exchange students since they probably don't take the test. You are right. It could be helpful in other ways, but probably not in the scoring of PISA.<p>I would assume that learning won't get any easier when you don't know the language. If you get bad start early on, it can hurt you later on or even frustrade you. So even it might be small aspect, it seems that PISA-test rewards for homogenous.",1217107885

Fred Wilson -- another fiery character -- would have shot back with the same passion.<p>For the record Jobs has publicly stated that he's fine; we know there were minor complications in a recent surgery, but that the rough patch is behind him.  Fred can have his doubts about that story, but that disbelief doesn't make it a lie.<p>Til we know with any measure of certainty that Steve has side-stepped the topic of a major health issue, honesty's got nothing to do with it.",1217106152

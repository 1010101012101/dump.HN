63506,comment,63403,63403,0,0,pg,,,"I'd always recommend an apartment for a small startup with little money.  Even if you don't live in it, I'd recommend getting an apartment as an office.  Apartments are cheaper and nicer to work in.  The only advantages of offices are that the can hold more people (not an issue for a young startup) and that they seem more professional.  But having a good product is more important than seeming professional, and you're more likely to get one if you work in a good place.",1191573648

63502,comment,63138,63305,0,0,pg,,,"The percentage is based on a very rough estimate of the startup's prospects.  If the founders seem like superstars and have been working on it for a while, we might ask less than 6%. Whereas if the company seems riskier we might ask for more.<p>We should go back and see if the predictions implicit in the offers correlate at all with how the startups have done.  ",1191573223

63500,comment,63009,63101,0,0,davidw,,,"I'll take a stab at this.  I recently read one of Milton Friedman's books, and I liked it a lot.  His pursuit of freedom is admirable, and something that I can understand.  He even suggests that freedom is more important than using government power to attempt to stop racism, for instance by letting people choose not to hire black people (as an example).<p>That got me to thinking though.  While I'm attracted to the sentiment of freedom above all else, what I think is missing in his equation is that communities tend to be sort of self-reinforcing.  It would be very difficult, if it were accepted by others to not hire black people, to be the first one to do so.  Now, laws against that kind of discrimination don't change the way people feel, nor make their racist sentiments go away overnight. However, they do drive those thoughts underground, and break the cycle of ""we've always done it that way"" by making it no longer acceptable.  And with time, that improves the climate and makes it easier for attitudes to change.<p>At least that's one thought that came to mind.  I really admire Friedman's purity of thought, but think that perhaps it's a bit naive.  It would certainly be an interesting subject to discuss in person with a person of that libertarian mindset.",1191572636

The compiler was done with this language whose file extensions ended up with .py .<p>After graduation, and working for years in companies that used Java, I still had good memories of that very powerful language, and I dreamed one day would be able to program with it again..<p>Well, I still have to code in java for living,  so, my next home assignment is writing a python interpreter in java,  (J2ME to be more exact).",1191572412

""<p>Clearly Microsoft wouldn't mind at all if someone modified the code for their personal use, as it wouldn't affect MS - the user would have an obviously unofficial version of whatever. <p>It seems the parent poster is implying that 'just anyone' could modify the actual mainline source code of an Open Source app. 
This is consistent with past statements from Microsoft about Open Source, usually along the  line of ""anyone can add code, you don't know where it comes from"". Both are incorrect.",1191571326

You wouldn't dare help a brain surgeon with a scalpel just because you know how to cut a steak, why is it any different for the highly brittle and sophisticated world of software?",1318895972

They can't build any product out of them. So they are paying a license to not get sued, not because they want the technology. Doesn't anyone find something wrong with this? The incentives are all wrong here, and it's focused too much on rent seeking.<p>You shouldn't be able to license a ""technology"" unless it's a marketable product. This is how we got into this mess, where thousands and thousands of trivial patents can be licensed. But say you really do invent some awesome technology, and it's not a complete product. Then you should only be allowed to <i>sell</i> that technology (with you not being able to use it anymore), but never to license it.<p>There are reportedly 250,000 patents in a smartphone. Microsoft themselves have less than 10% of that amount in total, probably much less considering not all their patents are mobile related.

If given the ability to view karma scores, I would leave them off, since I'm self-aware enough to realize that -- when karma scores are enabled -- my comments are of a lower caliber.<p>However, I'm not against allowing users with a certain level of karma the choice to view karma scores on threads if they really feel that HN is better with karma on, which it seems like a fairly large subset of users (or at least a significantly vocal one) wish for. I think that StackOverflow's successful moderation policies (and, to a lesser extent, HNs own) have sufficiently demonstrated that extraordinary members of a community can handle the responsibilities that come with increased privilege.<p>For example, I suspect that, if pg allowed individuals with high karma, such as yourself, to choose to toggle an option such as ""view karma scores"", no flood of dumb comments from high karma individuals would suddenly manifest. Further, I think that the transition from default karma displayed to our current situation has allowed anyone who has invested significant time in the community an opportunity for introspection that wasn't previously available. I'm now able to evaluate, personally, how my comments and behavior were effected by the display of karma and I'm less susceptible to the psychological effects as a result.<p>Of course, even if there isn't a significant negative aspect to allowing high karma individuals to view karma scores, it's still hardly worthwhile unless there's some kind of positive impact as a result. Perhaps mollifying the community would be enough of a benefit? Maybe a more pro show-karma individual would be better qualified to comment on the potential upside. My feeling is that it's possible that some subset of HNers exist whose experience with the community is improved by having karma scores enabled and, as such, it would be beneficial to allow them the possibility of a choice.<p>P.S.

First time I read that. I always thought Iliad was especially amazing because Homer conceived it all in his head and later had it transcribed. Since in that sense Homer's genius is unparalleled it wouldn't make sense to have corrections here and there. Nobody would ever know what brilliance would've been in Bach's Unfinished symphony, so what was present already would've probably been left unaltered.<p>And in terms of collaboration, wasn't the Bible a better example?",1179213184

To stay competitive, VCs often require an  expected annual return on new investments of 30-40%.  Because YC invests at such an early stage, I would suspect that their required return should be much higher.<p>A 50% discount rate would lead to significantly larger average valuations @ 5% equity ($15k invested):  $450,000 after first year; $675,000 at second year; $1 million at third year.<p>Since any later financing would dilute their stake, the expected post-money valuations should be even larger.",1179212669

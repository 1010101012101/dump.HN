7703273,comment,7702659,7702963,2,0,dnr,,,"Restaurants are a bad example. First, have you tried getting a seat at a trendy restaurant on Friday night in SF? Second, most popular restaurants deliberately charge less than an equilibrium price to avoid seeming unfair, and to keep all the seats full. Similarly, popular bands sell concert tickets for less than market rate to avoid seeming elitist, and also to make it more likely to sell out a show, which is more fun for their fans and attracts more attention for the band.<p>In short, not all business decisions are about extracting the most money possible at the present time.

IMHO, once you send off any piece of information (your personal data, files, photos, videos, etc), you can never know where they end up unless you have encrypted them yourself and they always exist in encrypted form outside of your computer. Data security is really an insurance product, you only know how good it is when something goes wrong.<p>Slightly off-topic of this article but Cloud security is all the rage these days. Either you set up some sort of app/gateway to encrypt all data which goes to the Cloud for archiving and/or processing and decrypt it when it comes back for viewing/updating/consuming etc OR you buy into the illusion of data security on the Cloud.",1399363053

Has it be considered to use:<p>1. text message history with a contact to derive a key between two contacts?<p>2. adding metadata to text messages to discover the sender uses TextSecure?<p>By (1), I mean Alice and Bob may already have exchanged several messages. I believe there is a lot of entropy in text messages. That should be leveraged during the key exchange. In addition, you&#x27;d also use WhisperSystems&#x27;s servers as another channel, so the mere possession of the text history doesn&#x27;t allow an attacker to guess the key.<p>(2) would only be useful when Alice sends her first text to Bob. She would for example hash(text_message + &quot;I use TextSecure&quot;), then append the encoded hash to the text and finally send it. The encoding could be white spaces for 0 and tabulations for 1. The size of the hash could be as small as 8 bits, because adding 8 trailing spaces/tabs to a text is so rare in real life. Once Bob receives the text, he can reasonably assume Alice uses TextSecure and then start the regular key exchange.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://whispersystems.org/blog/contact-discovery/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://whispersystems.org/blog/contact-discovery/</a>",1399361795

Adi Shamir responded to most of these claims, though he never explained the bizarre confusion over the Blockchain itself, and I think you can find some of that discussion on Bitcointalk.org if you search.<p>The second paper attracted a lot of attention because it identified an address used to move a large amount of money by Satoshi Nakamoto and linked that address to the Silk Road, with the clear insinuation that Satoshi Nakamoto was intimately connected to the Silk Road. However, simply Googling the address in question showed that it belonged to Dustin Tramell, who confirmed that it was his. In reality, there was no link to Satoshi Nakamoto.

There are several reasons for this.<p>First, Arabic itself is an incredibly fragmented language. Almost every country or region that speaks it has its own colloquial version of it which may or may not be mutually intelligible. As a Lebanese person I can understand Syrians fairly easily, Jordanians with a bit of straining and the other person speaking slightly slower than usual, Egyptians with a lot of straining and speaking slowly and Saudis not at all. Theoretically, we could communicate using the formal(written) Arabic, but most people, especially newer generations, tend to suck at that as it&#x27;s a much more difficult language that&#x27;s learned only in the context of school and pretty much almost never used outside, at least in Lebanon, that is. The colloquial languages are to the formal Arabic as French/Spanish/Italian are to Latin, basically.<p>Second, all good universities I know of in the region teach in English or French rather than Arabic. Though the trend is tipping towards English of late. This is because most of the region was put either under British or French mandate after the Ottomans were ousted during WW1. This was detrimental in many ways which I won&#x27;t go into, but one of the good things that came out of it was that they established many schools and universities. In fact, most of the good ones I know were founded by French, British or American missionaries during that period.<p>Third, well, the internet(and media in general), English is the dominant language in media most people consume. I learned English from watching cartoons as kid. I&#x27;ve almost never stepped foot in an English speaking country(except for a couple of weeks in the U.S. 2 years ago) and yet I can speak, and write, with almost native proficiency.",1399360219

In what country do you not have attachments, fear or sadness? Technology can make us more comfortable, but not &quot;solve&quot; life for us. Some people have more comfort in life than others, animals are even worse off than poor people, and gods in heavens are more comfortable than Bill Gates, yet all of them will face death and sickness in this life (including the gods in buddhism). The only escape is Nirvana.<p>From a secular perspective: There are lots of ways to look at this. We could see everyone as being on a spectrum. Your happiness levels depend on your position on the spectrum relative to your peers. Poor people in the US have cars, yet they are extremely unhappy and suffering. The same amount of wealth in India would make you middle class and much happier. So clearly the happiness is not a function only of money but also of perception. People were in general just as happy or sad 3000 years ago as they are today, what has technology achieved then? If technology was making the world more equal, I would support the proposition that development is a net positive, as everyone would have the chance to grow spiritually rather than spend a human birth just surviving, but that&#x27;s not the case. Technology divides more than it equalizes. There is no &quot;point&quot; to technology, it will happen. There&#x27;s no use fighting it, there&#x27;s no use supporting it over everything else. Technological progress is a fact of life. There is a point to equality, it allows everyone to achieve their potential and maybe reduce actual suffering on the planet.",1399360052

There&#x27;s no app to sell your reservation to someone else, scalping tickets is illegal or banned by the ticket vendor, etc etc.<p>The short supply is due to a market failure;  the city underprices the parking spots it owns relative to demand, increasing congestion and making it impossible to find a spot. This is to the point that people are theoretically willing to pay 20 dollars (or whatever Monkeypark will charge) in order to get an underpriced parking spot.  It makes no sense to distribute foregone gains from underpriced city land to random squatting motorists, instead of just raising pricing and having that benefit accrue to the owner of the land (the city).  It&#x27;s the same concept behind not allowing people to sublet my rent-controlled apartment for market rates;  the price distortion issue isn&#x27;t with the sublet policy, it&#x27;s with the rent control in the first place.",1399359693

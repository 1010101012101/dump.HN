Within the next 2-3 weeks, I hope to have it ready to be able to demo.<p>This app will have 2 types of users. One that will consume the niche content for free while the other will be recruiters who are interested in finding those niche individuals. The idea is to build a solid user base which will attract these niche recruiters.<p>I work in the same niche and have a lot of good personal contacts already. The question is: How do I start talking to these potential customers? I mean the medium. Sure I can call them up and send email to start the conversation. But I wanted to ask them more specific questions around their pain points etc. What do you guys use for this ? Survey monkey with questions ? What else ?",1359734385

5151415,comment,5150795,5151182,5,0,Osmose,,,"That doesn't matter, though. Let's take the example above and say there's 5000 .widget items on the page. There's two properties that need to be set. Assuming jQuery works as you expect, in the first case we iterate over 5000 elements setting one attribute, then do it again, for 10000 total operations. In the second case, it iterates over 5000 elements once, but sets two attributes, which is again 10000 total operations.<p>But this is all speculation anyway. Why not read the code? A bit of searching turns up the css function: <a href=""https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/css.js#L102"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/css.js#L102</a> . Interestingly, it passes a callback to something called jQuery.access.<p>More searching finds access here: <a href=""https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L713"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L71...</a> . Note line 719: If the key (which is the first argument to css) is an object, it just iterates through the object and recursively calls itself for each key-value pair in the object.<p>Thus, passing an object to css is equivalent to calling css multiple times, ignoring small costs of re-building the callback function that css passes to access (and I'm not even sure that cost exists, I'd actually expect any decent interpreter to optimize such that re-building it is of negligible performance cost).<p>The jQuery source code is a rather fun read, I highly recommend stepping through it from time to time. :)",1359734131

We're early-stage, pseudo-stealth, but with great momentum and access to the market, and we're well funded. It's a pretty unique company and market, and it's tackling a legitimate problem in the devops/sysadmin world. Our jobs:<p>Dev/ops: our backend systems and infrastructure are all written in Go (its awesome). We are ramping up to handle a jaw-dropping amount of incoming data. Data storage involves MySQL and other storage technologies in a fault-tolerant, distributed environment. We're looking for someone who can switch in and out of a couple of developer and sysops roles -- writing some server software, setting up some machines, whipping up some Chef recipes, and so on. We're a small team, so the real job description is ""we need another backend/infrastructure engineer.""<p>Frontend: the web app is backed by PHP and Symfony2, and fronted by a lot of JavaScript, using up-to-date technologies and frameworks. There's a lot of API interaction from JavaScript, and a complex user interface that's key for making our customers rave about the experience, not just the technology. We'd love to find someone who can hop back and forth between the PHP and the stuff that runs in the browser, and it's even better if they've got some design sensibilities and can help shape the product's features and functionality too. If you've got the latter skillset, then the PHP coding is optional.<p>Head of UX/UI: your impact would be immediate as we already have leading consumer web companies using our technology. Your impact would also be lasting because there really isnt anything in this space, and, if you can lead the defining efforts of UX/UI for system administration, then you will have moved the industry forward. 
Ideally, you know Photoshop, have worked with front-end development teams and know a little bit about system administration. Additionally, we work with a lot of charts and graphs, and notification feeds. Other than that, we are open to a variety of experiences.<p>As an early-stage company, we offer the chance to end up owning a fair chunk of what we believe is likely to be a very valuable business.<p>Email jobs@vividcortex.com",1359734048

You could write Quicken from scratch, but the $20 you save probably doesn't cover your effort. And unless you were really interested in the tax code, it's probably not very fun.<p>Following your example about food: we have a boutique salad restaurant near my house. It's like $7 for a salad, which seems absurd. But they're giant salads, and really filling, and most crucially they offer about 4 dozen toppings. I can't personally justify having a fridge full of salad toppings: it's a lot of work to keep stocked on fresh stuff, and I don't know how much money I'd really save after all the waste.  So I pay a little bit for the convenience, and I can have my kale salad with chickpeas and grilled tofu and beets and whatever else ridiculous stuff I feel like. It's all fresh and delicious, and I don't think I could have reasonably produced it at home.<p>That attitude extends to software as well. If it does what I want, and it does it well, I buy it.

One of Microsoft's most powerful profit generators was software integration (both in Office and Windows).<p>But integrated products (ones that do BOTH X and Y) are necessarily inferior at being the best X or the best Y.  A designer must make trade offs in order to make the integration work.  In the realm of software, the trade offs can be quite small, and so the integrated whole is quite good.  But in a hardware device, integration imposes critical constraints that make integration across functions quite painful; limited screen size, battery life, memory and storage, etc.  Perhaps the most insidious is overall UI complexity.  Making a device for keyboard and mouse is quite different than making a device with a great touch experience.  Having both (and even adding legacy Windows UI) is very challenging.<p>Microsoft should not have released a ""turd"" if they could not achieve a great experience within the design constraints.  I think most people believe this first attempt has serious flaws and compromises.<p>Because Apple has shown the world what a great experience a tablet can provide, I think users are unwilling to compromise just so they can occasionally connect a keyboard and mouse to it, or run legacy applications.

Some of that stuff doesn't make sense to port. For example, the value proposition of Visual Studio to Microsoft is not that it makes them particularly a lot of money, it's that it encourages its users to produce software that only runs on Microsoft's platforms. Obviously nobody is going to run Visual Studio on Linux if it can't produce Linux binaries, but it doesn't make any sense from Microsoft's perspective to allow that, so likely Visual Studio will never run on any other platforms.<p>And really the rest of it kind of suffers the same issues. Is Active Directory still worth it when the client devices are non-Windows? Probably not, unless they make enough integration modifications to the client OS that it would amount to producing their own Linux distribution. (That'll be the day.)<p>I guess I could see the case for selling Exchange Server for RHEL if they produced a Gnome, KDE or Android version of Outlook to go along with it.

Basic idea: Enable people entering a country on holiday/business to rent items that they can drop off again at the airport when they are leaving.<p>So an example use cases would be: 
- A backpacker will be backpacking in the country for 10 days. Rather than having the hassle/cost bringing over a tent/sleeping bag they would like to rent them.
- A business person visiting Dublin for three nights. This person would like an ipad for this time.<p>In both of these cases the person uses our website/app to create and account and make a reservation. They determine the pickup/dropoff (I.E city/airport) locations and a prices is agreed and paid with credit card. Upon arrival they pick up the item, show some id and use the product for the duration of their stay. They can drop it off when they are leaving at a booth in the airport or perhaps at other convenient locations.<p>My question is: would you see a market for this kind of service?

It's not a massive difference, but it is something.<p>Finally, on Mac OS, the operating system reserves some space for a memory dump if the device loses power so that it can resume where it left off.

5151194,comment,5150323,5150323,2,0,robomartin,,,"When thinking about these two options, responsive vs. not, I try to pull myself away from the developer or designer roles.  If wearing either of those two hats one might be tempted to become an evangelist for responsive design because, among other things, it's an interesting challenge.  Intellectually stimulating challenges do drive decisions sometimes.<p>What I do is put on a business hat and think in terms of actual benefits.  An, in my not-so-humble opinion, responsive design doesn't really mean greater revenue.  Here ""responsive design"" means a site where elements squeeze, move, re-align, collapse, etc. as you grab the sizing handle on your browser window and shrink or expand the browser canvas.<p>Why do I think this way?<p><pre><code>    www.ebay.com
    www.craigslist.com
    www.nytimes.com
    www.latimes.com
    www.ticketmaster.com
    etc.
</code></pre>
Of course, there are plenty of examples for responsive design.  Amazon uses a mild form of it and it works well.<p>IF responsive design were critical to keeping or increasing interaction or revenue all major sites would be using it today.  I think it might be safe to say that the vast majority of the top 500 sites use fixed designs.<p>This doesn't mean that you can't have one or two alternative CSS layouts for mobile viewing.  That might be the smartest approach:  one fixed design for desktop and one fixed design for small screens.<p>With this, if you have the traffic, you can A/B test and slowly optimize each fixed design to improve conversions.  With responsive design you might have to optimize over a dozen layouts, which is a huge job.<p>Again, in the end, I think that considering the options from a business perspective can cut through the crud and cause one to focus on what really matters if you don't have a hobby site.",1359732264

Bitcoin is a method of payment.<p>When someone sends you Bitcoins, your bitcoin software will decide whether they are fake or not. Since the entire transaction history is public, it can find all transactions to and from the person who is sending you coins, and see if they indeed have enough to pay you.<p>The problem is that, at first, nobody had coins. To get them into circulation a system was built: For finding a ""proof of work"" (just assume for now that it's something that takes a computer a certain amount of work to find), the program agrees that you earned an X amount of coins. It used to be 50 coins per proof of work, right now it's 25. It will get down to zero eventually and there will be 21 million coins in circulation. Never more.<p>A proof of work is easy to validate. It's like a big number is given, and you have to find its prime factors. It takes forever to search all possibilities, but once they're found, you can easily multiply them to check the validity.<p>So when you are sent coins, your Bitcoin program (called the bitcoin client) will check the transaction history for who found proof of works, how much they gained from it, and who sent coins to who. After this you know how much money someone has, and whether he can pay you.<p>It's up to your bitcoin client to use the same rules as everyone. You can decide that proof of works are worth much more or much less than everyone else agrees upon, but it will only prevent you from using the network. Most, ifnot all, other clients will reject your version of the truth.<p>I hope this cleared things up. It probably rose other questions, but most are asked before. Just google for it ;)<p>I also wrote a blogpost about Bitcoin, if you are interested: <a href=""http://lucb1e.com/?p=post&id=99"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lucb1e.com/?p=post&id=99</a>",1359731202

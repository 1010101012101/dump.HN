But I thought I had a source for the &quot;listening to music hampers your creative ability&quot; statement, and I can&#x27;t seem to find it.<p>You could reason that if you engage the brain with something, then it cannot do another thing at the same time. So if you engage the areas responsible for creative thought processes, these areas will not be available for other tasks.<p>Obviously this might not be the same for everyone, I&#x27;m just cautioning people and urging everyone to do some testing.<p>Another example is that many people (including myself) can&#x27;t dictate, for the same reasons. In my case, whenever I use dictation, I later go back and re-read what I wrote and it is always disappointing.

The only limitation, it seems, is that only one person can be playing the shared copy of a single game at any given time. All in all, this does sound like a pretty convenient feature that&#x27;s more workable than simply passing discs around amongst friends who are actually in your area.&quot;<p>That is nice. Just wondering how it works, hope you can lend a game to someone.

Most of the data i have seen suggests that there are not major class differences in drug use in the US, but there are huge class differences in enforcement because buying habits are different and so it takes more police work to bust the middle class than it does the poor.<p>I think that this is one of those cases where we have a perpetual social problem which cannot be remedied by automating the system.",1371120958

From the parent&#x27;s explanation, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a valid translation, even though I don&#x27;t know Ruby.  But having three levels of nested anonymous functions really makes the code hard to understand.  I&#x27;m guessing that this is idiomatic Ruby though, and if you program with the pattern long enough, it gets easier.<p>OTOH it&#x27;s still a barrier to entry entirely separate from the <i>syntax</i> -- if the <i>semantics</i> of Ruby code you see &quot;in the wild&quot; is typically this complicated, it&#x27;s almost as bad as Haskell and its monads!

5873327,comment,5869394,5872210,3,0,einhverfr,,,"I actually think that fewer laws and more limits on law enforcement practices is the way to go.  I am not that thrilled about isonomy because I think that history shows that isonomy never really is implemented and in fact merely shifts power towards those deciding how the laws are to be enforced.<p>Look for example at our experience in the US with mandatory sentencing guidelines.  This was done to take away leeway in sentencing from judges and in the name of isonomy.<p>What happened however was different.  The problem is that not all cases of a crime are created equal and so instead of <i>judges</i> having sentencing discretion, that was put in the hands of the <i>prosecutor</i> (who would then decide when to prosecute a lesser included offence).<p>The result is quite striking when you look at drug prosecutions today.  It&#x27;s not law enforcement that makes the difference but prosecutorial discretion.  The problem is that human life does not really admit of a situation where a purely mechanical view of justice actually does justice.  Total isonomy would not be a justice system but merely one which distributes injustice equally and blindly.<p>I don&#x27;t there is a way around this, and I think further we are better just openly admitting that isonomy is neither attainable nor desirable, but instead work to ensure that we really try to ensure real justice and hold people accountable, from the grass roots, for their decisions.",1371120659

It was a useful (though very random and sometimes temperamental) way to discover similar sites and content.<p>Other sites had &quot;guest books&quot; where people could comment on the site and include a link to their own. There&#x27;s little functional difference between guest books and today&#x27;s blog commenting systems, except back then there was less traffic, so site owners tended to actually read the comments, respond to them often, and follow the links of the commenters back to their own sites.<p>Then SEO spam came along, and eventually most people realised 90% of the links in comments were probably not worth following.

If you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on, then that does look like really icky code.<p>First off, parenthesis in ruby are optional. So calling a method can be done without parenthesis. The following two lines are the same:<p><pre><code>    print()\n    print\n</code></pre>\nAs are these:<p><pre><code>    print(1, 2, 3)\n    print 1, 2, 3\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s some bits that might explain better what stuff does:<p><pre><code>    :state\n</code></pre>\nIf you prefix a word with a colon that creates an object of type Symbol, with value &quot;state&quot;, which is a bit like the string &quot;state&quot;. The difference is that every mention of :state is a reference to the same object, while if you create a string &quot;state&quot;, and a bit further do it again, those are two different objects. We use symbols because it runs faster for conditionals etc: to compare two symbols the interpreter only needs to check the reference, while to compare two strings, every character needs to be checked.<p><pre><code>    initial: :active\n</code></pre>\nThis creates a Hash with one key-value, with key :initial, and value :active, both symbols. This is equivalent to typing :initial => :active which you encounter a bit further up.<p><pre><code>    do |var1, var2| .... end\n</code></pre>\nThis creates a block, which is like a closure. The variable names between pipes are the arguments this block takes. Any code inside the block is only run when the block is called. In Ruby, every function can have a block passed by adding do ... end to it. Inside this function, the block can be called using the keyword yield, e.g. yield(1,2) to call the block with arguments 1 and 2. The find_each method will loop through every value of the Array it is called on, and run the block once for every value.<p><pre><code>    project.users.present?\n</code></pre>\nThe question mark is a valid character for a method name, there&#x27;s nothing special happening here, present? is just the name of a method. This could easily have been called is_present, or just present.<p><pre><code>    a ? b : c\n</code></pre>\nThe ternary operator, the same in any language. It translates to &quot;if a, return b, else return c&quot;.<p><pre><code>    ->(arg1, arg2) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nThis creates a lambda, with arguments arg1 and arg2. A lambda is almost the same as a block, so this is almost the same as typing do |arg1, arg2| ... end",1371119482

Essentially, the barrier is very low to establishing that a software patent achieves a technical measure and falls outside the exception. For example in HTC v Apple, a lower court judge found a multi-touch related patent invalid as a computer programme, however a higher court overturned this ruling.<p><a href=""http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/from-alice-to-apple-patentable-subject.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/from-alice-to-apple-p...</a>",1371119104

This also holds for the whole &#x27;family&#x27; sharing &#x27;feature&#x27;, which I don&#x27;t really get anyway. If the XBox One is supposed to be the center of the living room media experience, I don&#x27;t think many households will buy multiple, and even less so, play them at the same time.<p>One thing that MS apparently <i>does</i> allow you to do is lend the game disc to a &#x27;friend&#x27; (someone who has been on your XBL friend list for more than 30 days) and play the game as long as the disc is in the console, and it can phone home every hour for some kind of DRM check I don&#x27;t understand...<p>I don&#x27;t blame the OP for getting confused by the ToS on the Microsoft site, which obviously have been carefully crafted to make them sound more reasonable.

Google&#x27;s on it though.<p>>> The launch of Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics may provoke a revolution in the research evaluation field as it places within every researchers reach tools that allow bibliometric measuring. In order to alert the research community over how easily one can manipulate the data and bibliometric indicators offered by Google s products we present an experiment in which we manipulate the Google Citations profiles of a research group through the creation of false documents that cite their documents, and consequently, the journals in which they have published modifying their H index. For this purpose we created six documents authored by a faked author and we uploaded them to a researcher s personal website under the University of Granadas domain. The result of the experiment meant an increase of 774 citations in 129 papers (six citations per paper) increasing the authors and journals H index. We analyse the malicious effect this type of practices can cause to Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics. Finally, we conclude with several deliberations over the effects these malpractices may have and the lack of control tools these tools offer.<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0638"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0638</a>",1371118958

Why is it different for a game?<p>The link I referenced before also mentions that on your Xbox, any user can play any game:<p>>Your friends and family, your guests and acquaintances get unlimited access to all of your games.  Anyone can play your games on your console--regardless of whether you are logged in or their relationship to you.<p>So anyone in your household can &quot;borrow&quot; a game from you just by using your Xbox. I guess this also introduces the idea of someone having a &quot;main console&quot; that is particularly linked to them.<p>>They use the word &quot;family&quot;, so I wonder what they mean? I guess they mean &quot;people in the same house&quot;, but I could be wrong.<p>I also saw this, but restricting it to &quot;people in the same house&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense in light of the previous points.<p>Regarding the issues you raised about Ann and Bob, they are completely valid points. I guess the most honest response I can have to that is that they, for better or for worse, just don&#x27;t seem to be Microsoft&#x27;s target market for the Xbox One. Luckily for them, however, the PS4 looks like it will be able to suit their needs much better.",1371118032

Microsoft has been making money out of patents and white-gloved mobbing for ever, not out of customer happiness. Probably around 90% percent of what they earn in OS licenses comes from preinstalled laptops and desktops, where the user doesn&#x27;t even have the choice to reject paying for them because they gently mobbed all manufacturers into shipping with their crapware installed, so they don&#x27;t even need to care about making a great product, just one that&#x27;s good enough and works most of the times.<p>I&#x27;ve paid for at least 5 Windows licenses that I never, not even for a split second, have used.

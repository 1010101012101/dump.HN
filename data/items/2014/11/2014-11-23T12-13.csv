Applications publish objects, others can call methods (one-shot) or functions (wait for response).<p>From DBUS&#x27; own (old) FAQ:<p>> D-Bus is a bit more complex than DCOP, though the Qt binding for D-Bus should not be more complex for programmers. The additional complexity of D-Bus arises from its separation of object references vs. bus names vs. interfaces as distinct concepts, and its support for one-to-one connections in addition to connections over the bus. The libdbus reference implementation has a lot of API to support multiple bindings and main loops, and performs data validation and out-of-memory handling in order to support secure applications such as the systemwide bus.<p>> D-Bus is probably somewhat slower than DCOP due to data validation and more &quot;layers&quot; in the reference implementation. A comparison hasn&#x27;t been posted to the list though.<p>IMHO DBus suffers from the kind of overengineering that&#x27;s been endemic in Desktop Linux in the last few years: DConf/GSettings (as a less flexible, IMHO unneccessary replacement for GConf), PulseAudio and NetworkManager (initially really bad, now work nicely, as long as you don&#x27;t have to debug problems...), all the *Kit stuff, systemd, and so on.

(Note that parts of higan are ISC licensed, and I have granted other emulator authors exemptions, eg Snes9X now uses my audio core.)<p>The reason in higan&#x27;s case, is because of the culture of the emulation community. There&#x27;s a long, dark history of closed source emulators (even now with SuperGNES, no$sns and SNESGT), and I feel that emulation is a bit different from ordinary software: here, we are working under the threat of time. We realistically only have another 10-20 years to improve SNES emulation before finding a working system and persons interested in reverse engineering it are impractical.<p>I think it&#x27;s very shallow and narcissistic to take the research of others, and not contribute back your own findings. I view this as more of an academic / historical preservation project than a regular desktop application. To end users, it&#x27;s just for playing games, and not tied to any other system components, so I feel less bad about it.<p>To give a real world example, I encountered a bug in SuperFX (GSU1) emulation, and found that FuSuYa had a tracer-based fork of Snes9X: he basically added in a few fprintf() statements, and then refused to release the source to his changes. That would have been fine, but he botched something and introduced a very serious bug, one that I was also experiencing in my emulator. If I were able to diff his source to the official Snes9X source, I would have found and been able to fix that bug in a few minutes. Instead, it took me about two weeks to track it down.<p>Once I feel that SNES emulation has reached its limits in terms of research, I&#x27;ll likely release the emulator under an ISC license as well.<p>Now I&#x27;m sure you can view this as me being hypocritical, and maybe it is, but that&#x27;s my answer: I feel there&#x27;s something more important than licensing at stake here.",1416744754

I won&#x27;t work with him and he probably won&#x27;t be willing to hire me.<p>14 would be great but I&#x27;m afraid paper and pencil are still the best tools if we want to trust the results of an election and keep ballots anonymous, notwithstanding a lot or research on the subject. I won&#x27;t trust any solution with an IP header that can be traced to me or with a database that could receive fake votes. At least in physical elections parties can send their representatives to polling stations and check if anything strange is going on.<p>29. Indoor Maps from Google is tackling that problem. Probably they are not the only ones working on that.<p>Getting 31 for free is pretty common in Europe and probably in other areas of the world.

BI is no different to any other income redistribution programme in that respect.<p>Of course when assessing the marginal value of a fixed quantity of dollars to different people one also has to take into account their individual preferences, and there&#x27;s certainly an argument that the net $100 taken out of the income earned in the sixty-first freelance hour worked by a software developer paying for a very expensive condo in San Francisco has more value to them than the extra $100 received by the person who quit their job after BI was introduced because they didn&#x27;t need an additional income source and found working a bit boring.<p>Obviously there are <i>many</i> people with little or no source of earned income that desperately need that $100 and would happily work longer and harder than the software developer for less money. Non-BI wealth/income redistribution programmes generally try to distinguish - with hugely varying degrees of success - between those who would find the extra $100 magic and those that don&#x27;t.<p>BI is unique in terms of welfare reforms in assuming that factors such as willingness to work and living costs are essentially meaningless when it comes to determining how much people need handouts.",1416744115

But again, I don&#x27;t see why this is desirable in light of existing and much more powerful alternatives to passwd files (U2F for example)?<p>Not quite.  To use a UNIX analogy, we&#x27;re using the blockchain to bootstrap a global, decentralized LDAP.  We&#x27;re making it so applications can resolve a username to its owner&#x27;s information without users needing to trust us, without applications needing to trust us, and without users needing to trust applications.<p>Now, my &quot;LDAP entry&quot; (i.e. my passcard) can contain whatever information I want to put there.  Anyone can verify the authenticity of subsequent updates to my passcard data by verifying that each update was signed by the same private key whose public counterpart got bound to my username when the passcard was created.<p>I <i>could</i> put information in my passcard that further identifies who I am, and I <i>could</i> put information that authenticates me to certain applications.  These are some of the key use-cases of my passcard.  However, what this information is exactly depends on the application.  The only thing Onename concerns itself with is ensuring that the application can discover this information when given the username, and be assured that the information was generated by the same principal that owns the username <i>without having to trust Onename or the user.</i>",1431460730

How can I manage this?

They literally had signs up implying it was illegal to be a short-term renter there and, if caught, you might be refused access to facilities.<p>However, the apartment (and the apartment blocks) was so obviously empty of long term residents, it was sad to see such a waste of space.<p>The owner of our apartment was someone in Oxford who I imagined was just trying to get a little money in just to pay the service charge while waiting for his capital investment to mature.<p>Despite the luxury of the place, this skyrise was like a dead zone. I felt sorry for the actual residents because there was no community for them.<p>And to loop around to a point related to your post, it didn&#x27;t make for a good holiday experience.<p>Actually, you can test these words of wisdom. Luxury is expensive so few get to experience it. However, in Thailand it is cheap so try it out.<p>One thing it will teach you is that luxury is fun for a minute, but it may not make you happy. Worth trying it first before you chase it too hard in your home country and realise what a mistake it might be to dedicate too much time in the pursuit of it.",1431459633

You shouldn&#x27;t damage property or steal items or assault people. But you can. Very easily. And depending on when/where/how you can probably get away with it. Does that make it ok?<p>Actions in the physical world have very lasting effects and, these days, leave a big trail which allows the proper authorities to catch the bad actor and dispense justice (the topic of what is proper justice being out of scope for this thread). The digital world is much harder with things happening instantaneously with very little if any trail. If publishers could catch you, they would. Realistically, they just can&#x27;t. But this lapse in their abilities does not empower and justify your abilities to do what should not be done.<p>Business models are a completely separate topic and, yes, it&#x27;s usually good to align the model with normal consumer action. However, human nature is to always take with the path of least resistance and in the case of &quot;value&quot;, to acquire it for nothing in exchange if possible. Most businesses work because they can block any access to that value without a proper exchange. Internet publishing however is very unique in that the very structure of the web which makes it so open is also what makes it impossible to stop and effectively filter anyone. The paywall is one such filter but they have this opening for access to Google listings and let a few users be randomly awarded free content. If there was a way they could be listed on Google without losing their paywall, they would, and this whole situation would be non-existent.",1431459340

The null thrust test did in fact take place, but only for the Cannae drive. The theory behind the Cannae drive is that it contains slots along the side of the cavity that produce the thrust.

It&#x27;s a badly kept secret in Manhattan that the program is often used by luxury developers.<p>One57 used a popular loophole in the law that allowed the developers to take the tax benefit for the building overlooking the park, but fund the affordable housing units in another location. One57 bought credits or &quot;certificates&quot; that helped fund those affordable housing units in outer bouroughs, according to city records. [0]<p>This is all part of a misguided housing policy in New York that focuses on &quot;affordable&quot; housing. This results in housing that is below market and a few lucky people that get in. For instance, one new building that got a lot of attention for having a separate door for the subsidized tenants (dubbed the &quot;poor door&quot; by the media) has received 88,000 applications for 55 subsidized units.

Forcing someone to take the entire value of that subsidy in the form of a housing credit is silly. For example, if you force developers to charge only $1000 for a $5000 apartment, you&#x27;re essentially transferring $4,000 from landlord to tenant as a housing credit.

9534122,comment,9530837,9533994,0,0,bradleyjg,,,"A few points.<p>First, I agree 421a is ludicrous, which is why I don&#x27;t see why you credit NYC for &quot;extracting concessions like low and moderate-income housing&quot;. 421a and similar programs trade billions of dollars in tax revenue that could be spent on everyone for hundreds of thousands of dollars in rental subsidies handed out to a few lucky lottery winners. That is terrible public policy. A park or subway station improvement is a little closer call, but cash ought to be the gold standard.<p>Second, I&#x27;m not sure I care whether billionaires buy castle in the sky in midtown or townhouses in Greenwich Village. I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to afford the townhouses anyway. It seems like the people most concerned about billionaires bidding up property are the centimillionaires being priced out. 100 units, even extremely large units, are a drop in the bucket for NYC. The knock-on effects are just not that large out in the places where the middle and lower classes live.<p>Finally, in terms of extracting more, I think the in-kind programs are both inefficient and a massive opportunity for corruption. I&#x27;d much rather see all the special deals -- parks, affordable housing, etc. eliminated and property taxes that reflect reality imposed, with perhaps a small pied-à-terre differential. The billions of dollars of missing tax revenue would be a lot more valuable to NYC than a few more housing lotteries or a small park, if for no other reason than you can subsidize rentals with cash but you can&#x27;t fix potholes with subsidized rentals.",1431457795

The system in NYC (for homes not condos) is that the assessed value is 6% of market value. While in other place like the entire state of California (at least at time of purchase) assessed value is 100% of the market value - a more straightforward method used in some states. The percentage is know as the &quot;assessment ratio&quot; and varies by state and even within states such as by city or county.<p>However the tax rates are much higher areas using the 6% method versus the 100% method. For example in NYC the tax rate is 19.157% while in San Francisco is 1.1743%. If you do the math the tax rate on market value is about the same. 6% * 19.157% = 1.149% in NYC versus 1.1743% in SF. In most places it is around 1% but can be over 2% in place like New Jersey, Illinois or upstate New York which unlike NYC relies more on property taxes.<p>None of this says anything about the NYC system for condos (class 2) that the article talks about but is often a source of confusion when comparing areas that use different systems.<p><a href=""http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/downloads/pdf/brochures/class_1_guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/downloads/pdf/brochures/c...</a><p><a href=""http://www.socketsite.com/archives/2014/09/san-francisco-property-tax-rate-slated-drop-next-year.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.socketsite.com/archives/2014/09/san-francisco-pro...</a><p>EDIT: Here&#x27;s a good recent review of residential real estate taxes across the US (290kb pdf):<p><a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2013/11/18-residential-property-taxes/18-residential-property-taxes-harris.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2013/...</a>",1431457693

If Tesla has done nothing else, he has shown that if there is a niche that isn&#x27;t being filled by the manufacturers, that startup can compete.<p>If the manufacturers overprice their cars, they create a niche for someone to move in on. Their current pricing model reflects this, but the dealership era is the past. They came about when car companies were going out of business all of the time and people wanted to deal with someone who had been in their town for a long time. They wanted to buy the exact something they could see and warranties were nearly useless.<p>Now we have the internet. If Ford screws someone over in Florida, California hears about it the same day.<p>Because of the competition that the internet has created, dealerships have had to move closer and closer to a 3% profit on sales or lose business.

2950532,comment,2949534,2949534,3,0,enobrev,,,"As a ""web designer"", HTML/CSS are your medium.  If you don't understand your medium, you don't understand your craft.  Last I checked, web browsers don't understand PSD files, which means without HTML/CSS the design isn't finished.<p>Imagine hiring a painter to do oil on canvas and they handed you a picture of a painting, or a sketch of what the finished painting should look like.  You hired them for oil on canvas - not something that looks like oil on canvas.<p>When hiring a designer for a web project, I expect to receive html files that can be opened in a browser.  In the very few cases where the designer didn't know HTML/CSS, I hired a designer who did to finish the job - because the inherent decisions with modeling a website in HTML/CSS are design-minded decisions.<p>As such, I suppose as a designer you don't HAVE to know HTML/CSS, but then I can't think of a single reason to hire you for a web project.  Print, maybe - provided they understand the needs and limitations of printing and can provide files in a format the printer can use.  Otherwise, I'm just going to have to hire a more talented designer to finish the job, which will leave me to wonder - why did I ever hire that first designer?",1314892747

2950529,comment,2948998,2949090,10,0,tptacek,,,"The worst breakage in the HTTPS/TLS security model is the fact that every CA is a full peer to ever other CA and can sign anything. Combine that with the fact that CA's are allowed to have <i>resellers</i> and the whole thing breaks down predictably.<p>It doesn't have to be that way. SSL/TLS libraries, for the most part, only verify that the certificate chain is properly signed all the way to the root. That doesn't mean the browser trust system is limited to that! After certificates are verified, it should be straightforward to apply additional policies, such as ""Colin Percival does not trust certificates from this CA with the exception of these three domains which unfortunately rely on it, but Colin and all his friends are also helpfully monitoring the fingerprints of the known good certs for those domains"".<p>You don't need permission from the IETF, IANA, Mozilla, or Verisign to build this.

Others have found that the Raspberry Pi blog posts and etc are coming from Broadcom addresses.  They're doing this on company time.<p>Earlier I thought this was a good marketing thing.  Other companies like TI are doing this to get chips in the hands of hackers and spread some goodwill towards future commercial users of their chips.<p>But, as others have noted, Broadcom is a lot more standoffish with individuals that want access to sample parts and datasheets.  So what is Broadcom gaining here?  Inroads into educational markets?  Access to open-source code written by tinkerers that they can incorporate into future EVKs and chipsets?<p>Maybe this odd part # is just a series of chips that have failed speedbinning and are being sold off cheaply?",1314892610

2950500,comment,2949323,2949323,9,0,earlylinkedin,,,"Some people are talking about the ""expected value"" of being an early employee, which is a very valuable view. I'd like to focus more on the best case to give a sense of what you can hope for if everything goes right.<p>I was fortunate enough to be an early engineer at LinkedIn after I graduated college. I was one of the first few engineers hired. I'm not an amazing company picker, and I barely knew what a startup was at the time -- I just got lucky because I knew one of the cofounders.<p>I received a decent option grant (especially for a kid just out of college!) and stayed at the company for two years. My options got diluted approximately 50% during the various funding rounds. Right now, LinkedIn is a top 20 website in the world, and there's a consensus that its current stock price is ""very optimistic"". My net worth on paper ends up being a couple of million. Needless to say, I'm thrilled. However, I also want to point out that there are only twenty ""top 20 websites"", and most of them aren't going to change anytime soon. So if you're one of the first few engineers at one of the 10-20 companies that's going to go from nothing to huge in the next 5-10 years, then you can view a few million -- perhaps 10-20 million -- as being the best that you can expect. And there are literally a few dozen, or maybe 100 people that will get this kind of success every decade. There is little skill involved here. It's all about getting lucky.<p>Furthermore, people forget that it takes time for value to build. It might take you 4 years to get most of your stock options and decide you want a more stable job or a change of scenery, but it might take another 10 years for your company to go public or get sold. You're giving up a big chunk of your 20s for the potential of a few million in your mid-late 30s -- but you could probably save close to that much anyway with good spending habits and better paying jobs.<p>So if you want to be an early employee at a start-up, it's an awesome experience. But you should do it because you love it, because you're passionate about the product, or because you cherish the learning opportunity. You shouldn't do it because you think it will make you a gazillionaire.<p>(just to be clear, I did love my time at LinkedIn -- I made some great friends, learned a ton, understood that startups are the kind of places that I like to work at, etc. I'm really happy I was there, and would be even if the company hadn't become a big success)",1314892339

You know I'm not.<p>I <i>am</i> a ""fan"" of TLS, as much as anyone can be a fan of a protocol. Most if not all of the smartest crypto protocol people in the world have taken shots at TLS. Roughly once every 3-5 years, one of them finds a new vulnerability in TLS, which, when fixed, makes the protocol stronger. That's gone on for roughly 15 years now, making TLS the soundest cryptosystem available to developers on the whole Internet.<p>You don't like TLS. I get it. You think TLS is too complicated, that it has too much negotiation and too much statekeeping to reason about its security. I think that's a reasonable position to take.<p>You used to advocate that people write their own encrypted transports to avoid using TLS. You don't do that so much anymore. When you used to advocate that, I yelled about it, because you were wrong. Predictably, when people write their own encrypted transports, they make grave errors that cause their cryptosystems to blow up.<p>Now you advocate that people use things like spiped, your new encrypted transport. That's fine too. I'm not recommending it, but wouldn't flag it if I found it on an engagement.<p>There you have the entirety of our engagement on the issue of SSL and TLS. Note how the Internet trust model doesn't factor into it? That's because we agree on that issue and there is no reason for us to argue about it.<p> <i>never mind</i>.",1314892015

Programming is coding. It's hands-on. People have to sit in front of a machine from day one, hour one of their learning. People learn from writing crappy code, and debugging crappy code till the code starts to work. People learn from making their own mistakes. People should learn that programming cannot be memorized and repeated ad nauseum on exams.<p>I remember the kind of folks i interviewed when i was starting a company in india in 1995. I was horrified at the nature of rote memorization in many schools and collages. I made a decision not to hire any one with a CS degree as i felt that i would have to spend too much time making them unlearn bad habits. I then decided to go out, hire students with no programming background, teach them coding from the ground up. Teach them to solve problems one step at a time. Teach them the joy of debugging. And they turned out to be great.<p>I suspect that every country, region, city, place might have to go through an evolution of programming culture, but the internet and it's legions of programmers gives a great way for beginners to short-circuit their learning process.<p>Let us know of ways we can help, as well.",1314891775

The value of coming out the other side with the experience and esteem of being that first employee is really huge.<p>I think the first employee hires of any startup with similar financial numbers as the article should be for employees who want to start a company of their own someday, because thats where you get the biggest value.

But to say that A) Coding is ""just math"" is completely incorrect. Coding is working with a language. A real programmer is a Creative individual, not necessarily an Analytical individual. It takes analytical skills and talent to realize what you need to program. But a good line of code is an elegant, poetic, wholeheartedly joyous expression of logic, efficiency, and your own Voice as a speaker of programming language. B) To ask that developers have the same skillsets as designers / graphic artists / branding specialists / etc. etc. is just really... Unreasonable. A basic conceptual understanding, sure. But I'll NEVER know what someone with a BFA degree knows. Not even a thumble's worth.

this is can stops investment from venture capitalists. 
I think, we dont need draw a line between huge and small startups. We just need another patent system - transparent 
and work well as we need. At first, we need to know, was gived a patent on our inventions or not - by few clicks. 
At second - we need to know, what kind of invention and claims for it was pended but still have not sugessted.
At third, we need to see all climes of concurents patents - because we are allways can invent another one claims, and 
build on them ower new products, that we can protect.
I think we can solve this problem - as technicians, we are much easier to prepare a bill 
and after appeal to members of Congress or the legislature with a request to meet our demands.<p>We need to change the whole system. Obtaining a patent should be a simple thing as buying a domain name 
or product in the online store. Now, placing an order, we practically give it to the blind - 
we do not know if already issued a patent for the same invention or is it the same invention is filed by someone.
We do not know this and therefore has a great chance that in six months we will

Static image mocks only paint about 60% of the picture when you're talking about modern (especially touch-based) interfaces. Static mocks don't give you enough information to accurately cull your ideas. Sometimes you need to build the damn thing, so you can touch it and move it and realize <i>well damn, that wasn't such a great idea after all</i> (or <i>oh, this part really needs to be changed</i> or the final, magical <i>yeah, that's not too bad</i>).<p>All of the best and most innovative UI designers that I've met have been able to build interactive mocks of their designs. Now - don't ask how they did it. It's spaghetti code that will curl your hair, frequently written using some arcane technology that might not even be supported anymore. But it works <i>just</i> well enough that they can use it to iterate on their ideas.<p>Now, you can split this job into two people. One a ""designer"" and one an ""interactive mock engineer"". In theory, it could work, but in practice I've found that it becomes hard for the designer to detect the flaws in the design. I'm not sure why. But the final product doesn't change as much. It doesn't evolve as much. It's rarely as good as it should be.",1314889584

The way both parties relate the story, Domscheit-Berg's exposure to the data appears to have been ""accidental"": Assange left the unredacted data set on a Wikileaks-owned server that Domscheit-Berg managed, trusting a obscured directory name to protect them.<p>By Der Spiegel's recounting, it hardly matters what Domscheit-Berg's intentions were, because the files were unknowingly swept up in Wikileaks BitTorrent disaster recovery process. At that point, it became simply a matter of time before the contents of the data set became public, with or without Domscheit-Berg's promotion.<p>The personality conflicts here between Domscheit-Berg and Assange and Rusbridger and Leigh are probably a red herring. The evidence we have now strongly suggests that Wikileaks was not a careful steward of the data they had; that Wikileaks own convenience trumped tradecraft and security.<p>That's fine and human and normal for most types of data. But most of the time, we're not dealing with the names of informants and whistleblowers in the world's most repressive countries.",1314889559

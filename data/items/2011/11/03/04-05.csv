3190373,comment,3189525,3189525,20,0,dasboot,,,"I use Ubuntu as my exclusive desktop OS.<p>Ubuntu / Linux has far bigger problems than Unity. (Jump to point 5 for conclusion).<p>1. There are huge regressions.<p>With the upgrade to 11.10 my laptop's battery life has been cut from 5-6 hours to 2-2.5 hours. This is on an Asus UL machine that on Windows gets 10 hours.<p>This may be a kernel issue, but Canonical could add a lot of value by at least warning, or better, fixing/minimizing the problem. There are all kinds of boot parameter hacks, etc. to try to fix this, but it requires a lot of reboots and fiddling with internals. How about including a script to optimize these settings that is run after the upgrade?<p>""Linux on the desktop"" is a dangerous misnomer, because on desktop computers power is not a concern. But nowadays power consumption is almost everything. Canonical already has its sights set on mobile devices, but hasn't even addressed power consumption for notebooks properly.<p>2. Poor communication of core functionality changes<p>New additions are presented and lauded in glossy detail, but removed features are not as clearly presented.<p>Nautilus (file manager) used to allow drag and drop copying/moving of files onto the left pane ""bookmarks"" folders. This was simply removed without warning, crippling quick drag and drop filing. Once again, this is ""upstream"", because of the Gnome/Nautilus teams' decisions, but it affects users in a noticeable way.<p>The initial update to Unity (11.04) removed all gnome applets, and made the time tracking software I used to use inaccessible. The upgrade to 11.10 made me lose my skype app/status indicator.<p>I don't care if my dock is on the left or bottom, or my open-close buttons are on the left or the right. Most of Unity's ""coolness"" is Compiz anyway - zoom, desktop switching, etc., so all that was available before Unity. For launching applications, gnome-do is still much faster, light-weight, and flexible (e.g. allowing creating/opening individual tomboy notes).<p>By communicating feature additions and subtractions better, people won't be so negatively surprised. Set proper expectations.<p>3. Key consumer software weaknesses<p>No good media creation suite. I was trying to make a photo slide show with a soundtrack a while ago, and I went through two days of installing/testing, setting up ppa's, compiling sources, etc. to get the latest versions, and nothing really works well. I mostly code, write, and use the web, so it's not mission-critical for me, but for a ""consumer desktop OS"", the absence of an official and well-functioning suite of applications akin to Apple's music and movie makers is a weakness.<p>Other apps like Evernote and a more up-to-date Skype would be nice as well.<p>4. What hardware does it run on flawlessly?<p>When you buy a computer with Windows or OS X, you know that everything will work. With Ubuntu/Linux, you don't. It's a huge stress factor before buying a new computer. Ubuntu has ""certified hardware"", but it's buried on some wiki page or other back page. This information should be front and center on the home page, so that I can buy something with confidence that it just works.<p>5. Conclusion<p>Ubuntu (whether Unity or Gnome) is far more usable than Windows (messy config menus, no multiple desktops, no full-screen desktop zoom, inconsistent shortcuts, etc.), and at least as good as OS X (which for example doesn't allow you to change the system's font size globally, and is less keyboard navigation friendly).<p>I'm considering abandoning Ubuntu again, because it can't compete on power consumption.<p>I am sympathetic to Canonical being annoyed by the bitchy entitlement complaints over superficial UI features (e.g., open/close buttons left or right). It's bike-shedding to the max.<p>That said, I think better up-front communication of changes can help set expectations. It forces the designers to reason why they are removing/changing/adding something. This doesn't have to lead to drawn out discussions, but some design decisions seem to be ""shot from the hip"" without realizing that they may affect/ruin thousands of people's work flow.<p>Lastly, there are huge issues like power consumption and predictable hardware compatibility that currently heavily weigh against Ubuntu/Linux.",1320296300

But things changed. The concept of an ""app"" have not been making sense for a long time: you can run Gmail and Facebook in two browser windows (which together live in the same process) or you can have a single window (Chrome) launching one process per tab, or you can have a terminal with several processes running in different windows, or you can have a copy of Microsoft Word embedded inside of an Excel spreadsheet. Similarly you can have an iframe with embedded Google Maps inside of your Wordpress blog. So what's an ""app"" then?<p>Microsoft correctly recognized in early 90s that the concept of a ""program"" or an ""app"" was obsolete, and modern UI should be using ""window"", ""document"" or ""folder"". An app is just an implementation detail: you can have 3 apps involved in rendering a single document or drawing the same window. Early smartphones couldn't handle these tricks (like multi-tasking) well, so this temporarily reincarnated idea of the ""app"" came back from the grave, to be happily copied by Unity just because ""iOS has them"".<p>Boo.",1320295023

You'll always be able to get that result and conclude the coin is biased, even if all coins used are fair.</i><p>This is not true. Because of the law of large numbers, the probability of ever reaching the 60% decreases with time.<p><i>I do think the one that says ""If I get one conclusion, stop.

You can move around using jkl, perform clipboard operations,deletions and other text operations generally without having your fingers leave the main keyboard area to reach for the modifier keys or arrows.<p>It works especially well if you remap Caps to Escape.<p>It's logical: dd deletes a line. 10dd deletes 10 lines.<p>f+ moves the cursor to forward to the next '+' character on the line.\n2f+ does it twice - moves the cursor to the second '+' on the line.<p>df+ delete from the current position to the first + character.<p>Commands are chainable:\nd2f+ deletes from the current position to the second '+' on the line.<p>In general when you have modal UIs (not specific to text editing) it makes it easier to accomplish work as you're working in a 'mode' that is specific to your task. When in insert-mode, your keyboard is used to insert text. In editing-mode[1] your keyboard's functionality is now used for the sole purpose of making edits and manipulating existing text. In visual-mode, the keys provide functionality to easily highlight and manipulate highlighted text.<p>That said - modal editing does have its drawbacks. There's a higher learning curve. And the lock-in thing I mentioned isn't necessarily a good thing. Non-modal editors can reasonably emulate each other's keybindings allowing you to easily shift between, say, Sublime and Textmate and Visual Studio. But good luck doing any of that with Vim thrown in. Also, Vim users have to still learn a reasonable amount of emacs keybindings in order to efficiently use the command line and native text fields on Linux/MacOSX.<p>Also as someone joked recently - Vim has 2 modes:<p>1) Beep at me\n2) Destroy all my text<p>[1] not actually called that but that's how I like to think of it",1320293562

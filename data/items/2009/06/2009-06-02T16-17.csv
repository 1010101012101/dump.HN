638084,comment,637568,637568,0,0,dkarl,,,"From a western point of view, the concept of ""Hinduism"" seems extremely broad.  A few hundred years ago, Catholics and Protestants routinely warred against each other, and many present-day Christians still deny that other self-identified Christians are ""really"" Christian.  When hatred between Christians and even Jews started to ebb, conservatives had to invent the bogus ""Judeo-Christian"" identity to create a new viable ""us/them"" distinction and revitalize religious xenophobia in the US.  When an American such as myself looks at the amazing variety of Hindu beliefs, his first thought is to suspect that Hinduism, too, is a political invention to unite a diverse group of people against the ""other.""  I don't know of any evidence for this theory, though, and the idea of Hinduism as a common tradition seems to be pretty old.

That said, this really bugged me:<p><i>Kurt Vonnegut once told a story about seeing Joseph Heller at a wealthy hedge-fund manager's party at a beach house in the Hamptons. Casting his eye around the luxurious setting, Vonnegut said, ""Joe, doesn't it bother you that this guy makes more in a day than you ever made from Catch-22?"" ""No, not really,"" Heller said. ""I have something that he doesn't have: I know the meaning of enough.""</i><p>I hate stuff like that.  Heller wasn't giving up 90% of his possessions and living in a shack eating beans and rice, which would be ""enough"" for many people in the world.  It's all relative, ultimately.  Just because someone with wealth chooses to live what you consider to be an opulent lifestyle doesn't mean they don't know what enough is.  Billionaires have such a staggering amount of wealth that they can give 95% of it away and still live an incredibly comfortable and extravagant lifestyle.  I like to think about Gates and Buffett here, both of whom will ultimately probably give away over $100 billion, but who both live very comfortable lifestyles, Gates much more so than Buffett, but even Buffett flies around in a private jet.<p>/rant",1243960003

The guy posted a blog post on his own blog.  He didn't post off-topic content to a thread and didn't try to provoke an argument in an otherwise civil conversation.  The only possible way that you can characterize this as a troll is that he uses some crude language, and says some things that are unpopular on HN.  But say what you will about the content, he didn't try to <i>make</i> you read it.<p>Second, the guy has a point.  I've had a rant like this building in my craw for a long time, and this guy nailed nearly every point I've wanted to make.  From a software engineering perspective, web development is in the dark ages.  What's worse, it's a luddite process -- a totally self-made exile from the benefits of 50 years of progress:  Type safety is shunned.   Language efficiency is ignored.  Data structures beyond the hash table are exotic and rare (and worse, I've met more than one ""professional"" web developer who couldn't tell me the difference between open and closed hashing!)<p>I understand very well that programmer time is more valuable than computer hardware, and that the speed/development time trade-off is often biased toward development time.  But if you ask me, what was once an intelligent guideline is now becoming a cult.  It <i>is</i> possible to do rapid development in a compiled language, and there are some really good reasons -- beyond execution speed -- to revisit the idea.",1243959779

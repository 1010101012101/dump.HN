I'm so glad that modern cameras generally have an option to disable digital ""zoom"". It's really just a euphemism for premature cropping.",1261302290

Both of these would probably have a chilling effect over the short term (couple of hundred thousand years).<p>Runaway warming following some massive release (from somewhere) of a greenhouse gas - possible one supposes but it does not look as if anything like that has happened during the last few million years.<p>The most likely medium term scenario based upon the rather limited historical climate data we have is that we will slowly move into another ice age. Now that will be cataclysmic for folks living in the Northern temperate zones where most of the current world economic activity takes place.",1261301592

Do you also refer to them as ""black people""?<p>In the U.S, ""black"" is a race, it's not a skin color. About 70% of ""black"" people in movies and music have light skin color that would probably not have the same camera problem.<p>So technically, saying ""black people"" would be wrong. The technically correct term in this particular example would be ""dark skinned people"".",1261300469
1005955,comment,1005724,1005724,0,0,davidmurphy,,,"One thing I noticed about France vs. the US is that in the cafe culture in France means it's fine to ""stare"" at passersby as you sit, slowly sipping your espresso.

I don't think any other language allows me to write programs that are more concise.<p>The other thing that 2009 brought me was iPhone Development. Although I don't like Objective-C that much, the Cocoa Touch framework is excellent. Once you get a grip on it and on the design patterns your code tends to get very small, too.<p>With both these technologies I shared the same experience: at the start they look incomprehensible and working with them made me less productive. However, only after really learning them I started to full appreciate all the things.",1261300052

1005952,comment,1005884,1005884,0,0,bigmac,,,"LLVM.  It is a ridiculously well written and well documented codebase.   The transformation/optimization framework is remarkable and surprisingly approachable.  The compiler intermediate representation is easy to work with both in the emitted bitcode files and in llvm's internal data structures.  I find it a joy to work with.<p>Its also cool due to all of the other great technologies that are taking advantage of it (Mono, Parrot, Adobe CS4, Apple)<p>I think once llvm and clang become mature enough, the FOSS community will completely supplant gcc with this technology.",1261299993

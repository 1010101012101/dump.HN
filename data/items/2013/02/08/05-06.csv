While the C++ libraries (std::string, etc) and other differences can help, they can be subverted through ignorance or will, and often are. The strict typing in C and C++ helps eliminate bugs over the same task written in assembly (or Forth, etc). In the same way, <i>goto</i> might best be used sparingly, since the sharper the tool, the more likely the damage done by accident. C and C++ sit at approximately the same ""danger"" level (potential for low-level access) whereas I think functional languages <i>can</i> be automatically ""safer"" (admittedly ill-defined), assuming you are willing to subjugate yourself to them and can trust the implementation (which is not always a fair assumption), since compilation boils down to a relational proof. (That's not to say it's my preferred style.)<p>Furthermore, Haskell and OCaml, for example, can both be compiled to linkable objects (C interface-able), so I don't see the loss of interoperability as you suggest. A Haskell <i>.o</i> looks like any other.",1360303153

If an article is written by a news source, it stands to reason that is is <i>not suitable</i> for citation by another news source. They are both at the same level of empiricism, one cannot be an adequate citation for another.<p>And second, the exchange of data has not changed drastically in the says since the story was first reported, so this isn't an internet speed issue. It's an issue of people being less pliable to the truth once they've hit upon a wonderful fallacy.<p>What that translates to is that news articles need to be less sensationalized, more factual and have a much more rigorous set of criteria for what's true and what's not.<p>I'm not a journalist, but I wouldn't be surprised if journalists deliberately look for what can be sensationalized in a potential story, to the point of <i>unintentionally</i> fabricating material - it is not inconceivable that a reporter simply skimmed some material about the FCC and then this story hit him like a ""Eureka!"" moment.

5186528,comment,5186359,5186359,2,0,wallflower,,,"Average developers are those who aren't committed to getting better or keeping up. In some software areas, those two terms are synonymous.<p>To use a specific example, in the mobile development world, which is arguably one of the ""hottest"" development jobs (the dot-com-like hype gold rush aside), you have to keep improving to continue to be relevant, let alone 'realize your potential'.<p>The above average mobile developer keeps up with the best-in-class practices and the ability to deliver to the baseline customer experience expectations for the platform (which keep going up and up - customers are spoiled by the Instagram/Airbnb-type apps of the world).<p>For example, iOS has gone through significant changes from iOS 2 (original) to iOS 6. Maybe three or even two years ago, using ASIHttpRequest was good enough for async network operations. Now, everything has gone to blocks. Sometimes enough blocks tied/nested together to put Lego to shame. Storyboards have started to replace tedious UIViewController plumbing. Modal dialogs used to be tolerated by customers, now obvious use of them make your app look cheap and outdated. Custom animations (and yes maybe even custom tab bars) are almost expected (this is good and bad) - but simple stuff like tapping on an image to expand it to full-screen and tapping on it to collapse it back to thumbnail - the customer expects that.<p>As for Android, Android is running at a pace that leaves average developers behind. Someone who still uses TabActivity for apps is rightfully categorized as out-of-touch with the post-Holo look and feel. If you don't have an ActionBar in your app, your app is out of date. Someone who uses BroadcastReceivers for piping data between Activities and Services is out-of-date (see Square's Otto or GreenRobot's EventBus).<p>I know this devolved into a bit of a rant - but developers have to keep up with the best-in-class practices - and in the best case - ""rockstar"" class developers like Jake Wharton of Square for Android - can inspire others and give the community the right tools to push the entire platform forward and make it more competitive (in this case, with iOS).<p>I believe the best developers share their knowledge (whether in a closed environment like a team - or best - Github and conferences and podcasts/screencasts) so that others can become better.",1360303008

5186513,comment,5182864,5182864,2,0,ww520,,,"Remember that a yacc file builds an AST tree and paying attention to the AST tree goes a long way in understanding yacc file.<p>Language ambiguity due to context is pretty common.  The way to deal with them is with nested scope symbol tables.  And determine the semantic of a symbol usage based on previous declaration of the symbol, tracked in the symbol tables.<p>In the article's example, x + 3, it confuses the stages of the lexer and the parser.  The lexer only knows x as a symbol.  Its output is symbol('x') op('+') num(3).  It doesn't know it's a function call or a variable reference.  It is the parser's job to figure out the semantic of x based on context and to build the AST.<p>In this case if x has been declared as a variable before, its symbol and type info are recorded in the symbol table.  When x + 3 is encountered, it's a simple lookup on the symbol table to see if it's a declared variable and generate the AST node with op('+', var('x'), num(3)).<p>If x has been declared as function in the symbol table, the lookup will generate the funcall AST node.<p>For special declaration rule like usage before declaration (as in Ruby), the lack of definition in the symbol table can be defaulted to a funcall.",1360302576

For instance, RHEL 5 has ""curl-7.15.5-15.el5"" right now, and that would suggest it doesn't support either of the CURLOPTS required to disable this.<p>However, the actual build loops in a patch called curl-7.15.5-CVE-2009-0037.patch, and that adds in all of the CURLPROTO_* magic required to lock down an application.  I discovered this tonight when updating my client-side code to restrict redirects and found that it would build fine on RHEL 5 even though I expected it to die.  A little digging around in the source RPM explained it.<p>So, if you're on an OS like RHEL and you think you might not be able to use this feature, try looking in your curl.h file.

We breath chemicals, we eat chemicals, we touch chemicals every day.

I hate it, it has its own host of problems, and memory corruption is certainly still an issue there, but the most common issues that plague C apps won't plague properly written C++ apps/libraries.  C's string handling (or lack thereof) has cost the world an immeasurable amount of time and money.<p>The biggest advantage that C++ has over just about everything else, is that you can use it to write libraries usable from everything else, and you can do it very easily.  You can expose a C-style API trivially, and bind it to everything you want; that advantage can't be overstated.<p>While I'd love for everything to be written in pure safe, managed code, that's not viable right now.  C++ is the best alternative we have, when safe languages aren't usable for the task.",1360300299

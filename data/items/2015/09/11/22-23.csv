AFAICT there is no reliable way to determine how many cells an arbitrary Unicode glyph will occupy when output to a terminal. None. You can use  various wcwidth() functions as a first approximation, but you have to give up on things working in the general case, because there&#x27;s no guarantee (in theory or in practice) that the terminal&#x27;s font will actually honor the width defined by the standards.

10206544,comment,10202346,10206349,0,0,divideby0,,,"So one of the challenges in a containerized environment is that services start up on random ports. If I&#x27;m running a Postgres container with the default Docker networking mode, for example, the internal port of 5432 may be bound to the host port of 12345. This allows me to spin up multiple instances of Postgres on the same machine for greater service density.<p>However, in a distributed environment, services can spin up on different machines. The instance of Postgres my application needs could be on server1:12345 or server2:23456. But in a distributed system, you need a cross-cutting service that&#x27;s available to all servers so that if my app is running on server1, it can find the right Postgres instance running on server2.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert on etcd, but my understanding is that the most common use case is to run etcd on each host machine. When services start up, their supervisor registers the service&#x27;s hostname, port, etc with etcd&#x27;s key-value store. This registration is then propagated to other etcd nodes in a consistent manner, using a consensus algorithm called Raft:<p><a href=""http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/</a><p>Consensus actually turns out to be one of the harder problems in a distributed system design. If I have a network partition that prevents etcd instances from seeing each other, you don&#x27;t want one instance reporting incorrect or stale data. Otherwise, my application could be writing to the wrong service, causing data loss.<p>Etcd does consensus extremely well, and in a way that scales to support hundreds of nodes.

And why<p>Actually, that analogy reveals the silliness of the assertion that code is not an asset. Because its equivalent to asserting that factories -- the <i>canonical</i> example of a capital asset -- are not assets.<p>That are code base with greater maintenance requirements with equivalent functionality to one with lesser maintenance requirements may be analogous to a higher-maintenance factory with similar functionality to lower-maintenance one (which isn&#x27;t really controversial) doesn&#x27;t support the idea that code is not an asset, just that maintenance costs is an important consideration in the net value of a productive asset, which, again, is common across all classes of assets.<p>That LOC might be a metric associated with maintenance costs of code doesn&#x27;t stop code from being an asset doesn&#x27;t stop code from being an asset any more than the fact that part county might be a metric associated with maintenance costs of industrial machines stops such machines from being assets.",1442011321

The rules in my retrospectives are:<p>1) You may put anything up on the board that you want as long as it doesn&#x27;t break any of the other rules.<p>2) Anything said during retrospective will not be used against, or brought up during, a performance evaluation.<p>3) Anything you add to the board must in some way involve you.<p>4) You may not complain about other teams inside/outside of the organization.<p>To break these down a bit. First, we can write anything (that doesn&#x27;t break other rules). In a sad column I might put &quot;I didn&#x27;t update Jira well, I felt I wasn&#x27;t really getting any value out of it.&quot; &quot;I was stuck on some code and decided not to test drive my solution, then I didn&#x27;t go back and add tests.&quot; In the happy column I might put &quot;John reached out to the SA group and I was inspired by his attitude in doing so.&quot; &quot;Our team accomplished task 123 in half the time we thought because we pulled together on the algorithmic portion.&quot; When I first started conducting retrospectives people were hesitant to put down things THEY were doing wrong and needed to improve on. They just complained. Getting them to open up was important.<p>This leads to rule number 2. People need to feel safe to say things that they need to improve without being penalized. Frankly, why would we penalize people for trying to improve? Yet the psychology of the situation often makes us believe we will be in trouble for honesty. This is why the rule was added. When people realize and become comfortable with it, they open up well.<p>Third and fourth rules go together. You must be introspective: &quot;What can I do better?&quot; &quot;What did I do well?&quot;. Too often retrospectives degrade into complaining sessions and nothing is our fault. Enforcing the rule that we must never complain about another team and we must talk about ourselves removes this nicely.<p>The psychology of the whole thing is quite interesting. Let&#x27;s imagine you add the following to the sad column of the board: &quot;I was stuck on some code and decided not to test drive my solution, then I didn&#x27;t go back and add tests.&quot; The hope is that there would be some great discussion about this, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you get back to the testing? Well I didn&#x27;t have time because of these other requirements. Oh, next time let me know and I&#x27;ll help you write the tests, or take the tasks.&quot; That is all good discussion (and it could go 100 different ways). But the other part is, do you really want to put that up multiple weeks in a row and admit to your coworkers that you aren&#x27;t testing if that is the cultural norm? Heck no! So you do better. Often, you are your own judge and advocate.<p>A few final thoughts. When starting retrospectives with a team for the first time I will often put up the worst things about myself. I want people to feel comfortable adding things about themselves. It helps. I hold retrospectives once a week not at the end of sprints (unless a sprint is a week, which I am also a huge advocate of). I hold retrospectives in the morning and never on a Monday or a Friday. It is always at the same time and on the same day. My teams are usually relatively small (another thing I highly suggest). Never over 8 people, and often 4.",1442010955

There are only a few high schools in the entire region that have anything resembling a representative mix of the demographics found throughout the region.",1442010495

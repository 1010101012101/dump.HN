Ruby with Event Machine<p>2. Javascript with Node.js<p>3. Erlang with/without OTP<p>I know/love Ruby the best, but am comfortable with Erlang or Javascript, so I'm willing to go with the best tool for the job - as long as it is one of those three ;).<p>As I see it the above options have the following aspects recommending them:<p>Event Machine<p>- Ruby is my favorite language<p>- Ruby community is awesome<p>- Ruby libraries are awesome too (though not sure which ones are good for ""evented"" environments)<p>Node.js<p>- The new hotness (for better or worse)<p>- Impossible to write in a non-evented manner
- Peepcode screencast<p>- A lot of traction<p>Erlang<p>- Has many high-profile deployments (like Github and Ericsson) so it can definitely handle my demands<p>- Very robust language that has survived the test of time<p>- Hot-swappable code<p>- Scales well to multiple servers<p>- Pragmatic screencasts and good books<p>So for those who have used any of these technologies in production deployments (and especially if you have used more than one of them) I'd be interested in knowing about:<p>1. How did it scale (to many clients, across many servers)
2. How did you approach testing
3. How enjoyable/smooth/intuitive did you find the coding process
4. How much in-built support did you have for doing things ""the right way""<p>FWIW I'm mostly leaning towards Erlang, but very willing to have my mind changed<p>Thanks!

If they think something is important, they'll keep trying ... and trying ... and trying ... and eventually they usually turn out something pretty good.   They did it, for example, in the browser wars (IE4,5,6 were substantially better browsers than their Netscape equivalents).<p>Everyone I know who has the latest xbox thinks it's a pretty awesome device and it seems to have turned the corner in terms of profitability.    It's already in millions and millions of living rooms, has topped the other consoles in sales for the first time and now with integration into WP7 and things like Netflix it is turning into a pretty compelling offering.

1845309,comment,1844500,1844837,0,0,btmorex,,,"Even the basic reporting is pretty terrible. For example, I have a pretty low credit limit given my income (mostly because I stupidly canceled cards I wasn't using). For months I tried to get it raised without any success. Finally, I paid for one of those credit reports that has suggestions and found out my problems are because I've been ""carrying"" too much debt... except I don't carry any debt. It's just that my limit is so low when the month rolls around I often am using close to the limit (which I then promptly pay off). Basically, your credit utilization can be extremely high even if you pay in full every month.<p>Solution: pay in full right before the month rolls over. I've already had two credit limit raises after doing this... but why should I have to? Why should I have to arbitrarily change habits that have nothing to do with good finance just to appease credit bureaus that aren't doing a good job to begin with?",1288306503

1845295,comment,1844578,1845004,0,0,fleitz,,,"If you want to write async code in .NET, use F#.<p>You can compose and BeginOp EndOp functions into a function that returns an Async<T><p>I've probably screwed up the exact function name but here's the psuedo code.<p>Example: 
Imagine a C# class as follows<p><pre><code>  public class Foo {
     public AsnycResult BeginGetBar(int bar_id) { // something }
     public Bar EndGetBar(AsnycResult result) {
        // something
        return bar;
     }
  }
</code></pre>
Now to consume in F# create an extension method<p><pre><code>  type Foo with
   member x.AsyncGetBar = Async.FromAsyncResult(x.BeginGetBar, x.EndGetBar)
</code></pre>
Now to use it<p><pre><code>  let somefunc = async {
                  let x = new Foo();
                  let! bar =  x.AsyncGetBar(10);
                  // do something with bar
               }
</code></pre>
What F# does is create a call back that is the rest of the function after the let!/do! statement, basically your code is split into a call back everytime you use a let!/do! binding.<p>For a more interesting example lets say you want an async file copy.<p><pre><code>  let copy s1:Stream s2:Stream = 
   let buffer:byte[] = Array.init 8192
   let rec copy = async {
     let! read = s1.AsyncRead(0,buffer.Length,buffer)
     match read with 
     | 0 -> ()
     | x -> do! s2.AsyncWrite
            return! copy()   
   }
</code></pre>
The nice part about this is that copy is a fully reusable piece of code async code. So anytime you're in an async block and need to copy a file, so...<p><pre><code>  let move s1 s2 = async {
    do! copy s1 s2
    do! delete s1
  }</code></pre>",1288306280

One of the many functions of Government is to provide a mechanism for the economy to move beyond a suboptimal economic maxima. Spending money on infrastructure, like bridges, does exactly this. No private firms will build a bridge because they can't make money off of it, but all private firms benefit from the increased availability and mobility of labor. The pre-bridge state of affairs is a suboptimal maxima. (Protip: WWII military spending enabled the US to escape the suboptimal maxima of the Great Depression. That is, government spending, of which, military spending is among the least effective at creating jobs and improving the economy.)",1288305675

However the Swedish system does a lot to eliminate and streamline the system. Calling to get an appointment gets you on the phone with a nurse to triage you, so urgent things are seen urgently and non-urgent things get scheduled in. I know doctors and go to doctors in Sweden and they see drug company reps significantly less than American doctors do. They aren't allowed to meet with drug reps like happens in America. I went to a hematology/oncology clinic in the US and there was always drug reps coming and going, if they had cut that down they'd be able to see more patients, and keep their appointment times with their patients. However these doctors it turned out whored themselves out not so much for the free meals and such, but to collect as many free samples as they could so their poor patients could be given at least a partial supply of drugs they would otherwise not get.<p>For my particular condition a subcutaneous treatment was developed in Scandinavia and the UK. It costs half as much to treat a patient and requires no care from a nurse to administer the alternative IV. I can give myself my drugs on my own time instead of taking time off work to go into a clinic. The drug is finally making its way over the pond now, but uptake is slow. Not every person with my condition can go on the subcutaneous, but back of the envelope math says at the very least $100 million a year would be saved if all patients who could go on went on it. In addition 150,000 nurse hours would be freed up as well each year.<p>Let's not forget the personal savings of time being on the phone with the insurance company. In the year before I moved to Sweden I lost roughly a week of work to being on the phone with the insurance company cause things weren't billed right or they just decided that I didn't need my IV anymore or getting them to pay for things they pre-authorized, but decided to deny when the bill showed up. I have spent absolutely no time discussing those sort of things in the last 3.5 years I've lived in Sweden. That's time I spend earning money and paying taxes, which seems to be win-win.",1288305475

They are right with their examples, say Shell in Nigeria or where was it -- but Government is usually involved too in these cases.<p>From a pure capitalist point of view, there will always be isolated instances of short-term enterprises destroying the source of their wealth --- their river, land, fishing or hunting grounds --- but the ones that will logically prevail are those that protect and future-proof their resources for long-term wealth gains, especially when the investment is very high (talk about oil, mining etc.) so that the return on investment will need to be earned over decades. It is not in the interest of the farmer to devalue his land. It is not in the interest of the fisher to exterminate all fish.<p>It may well be in the interest of global corporations to drain the natural resources of poor countries where the land is granted by the government rather than privately owned and only the short-term monetary gain matters to both parties.

While these divisions include a collection of products and services (e.g., Azure), it appears that most of the revenues and almost all the profits of these divisions is driven by Windows (desktop and server) and Microsoft Office.<p>Its remaining two divisions – Online Services and Entertainment & Devices – encompass all of the company’s consumer products outside of Windows and Office, such as the Xbox 360, Bing, Windows Mobile, and Zune. In 2010, these two divisions accounted for the remaining 17% of Microsoft’s revenues, and had a collective operating loss of $1.676b. In fact, between 2008 and 2010, these two consumer-focused divisions generated an aggregate of $3.353b in operating losses.<p>Looking across its five divisions, we can conclude that Microsoft generates a majority of its revenues and nearly all of its profits from Windows and Office. And while Microsoft has found some success with other enterprise products (e.g., SharePoint, Microsoft SQL Server, and services), its consumer strategy, outside of Windows and Office, is struggling.<p>From my vantage point, the two key questions for Microsoft are:<p>1. In what timeframe will Microsoft face downward pressure on its Windows and Office revenues and profitability, given the transition from desktop computing to thin devices and cloud services?<p>2. Can Microsoft develop and execute a corporate strategy in the consumer or enterprise markets, outside its stronghold of desktop computing? And will this strategy substantially compensate for any disruption in its core market of desktop computing?<p>My sense is that the transition from desktops to cloud services and thin devices is accelerating due to rapid innovation and growing competition among Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Salesforce.com and others. Further, Microsoft has thus far underperformed in cloud services and thin devices, from search (Bing) to smart phones (Windows Mobile). In view of Microsoft’s dependency on Windows and Office, and its inability to gain significant share in newer growth markets, I am concerned about its long-term prospects in computing.",1288304221

1845146,comment,1841155,1843160,0,0,kuahyeow,,,"I think a pod is a host, like wordpress.com is a host of WP blogs, hence a database per pod. A seed is an individual user account. The way I understand it, each seed can be encrypted so that even the pod owner can just look in the database.<p>The really interesting bit comes from key and information exchange between seeds. I agree it's going to be hard to explain all this succinctly to users. Theoretically, the goal is secure and decentralized social networking. One use case would say, a friend on another host can see your photos, but no one else on that other host. Can this ever be done in a foolproof and secure way? I can think of a lot of different things that can fail - malicious impostors, users setting the loosest security, revocation, but it might be good enough for a vast majority of users.",1288303564

I work a day job (as a systems analyst) that I'm quite passionate about, and my ""side project"" is as an artist / illustrator.<p>To get suitable stretches of uninterrupted time outside of a 9-10 hour day at work, I have to be militant about influence on both time and energy on any given day. The energy one is the hardest one to manage, and it involves cutting a lot of people out of my life, specifically the ""draining"" ones.<p>I used to be the kind of person that would invest a lot of energy in trying to get other people motivated or help them through hard times, then I realised I had nothing left to keep my own life moving forward.<p>I stagnated for a period of about 2 years then drew the line and cut off anyone that I found repeatedly crashing in on my life looking for support without doing a damned thing to help themselves.<p>At this point in life, professionally I'm achieving about 2x-3x what I used to but my personal life is abhorrent. It's a trade I'm willing to make but something that will need to be balanced out as I get older, as I'm already in a circumstance where I have few non-professional peers what so ever.",1288303382

Having faced with so many Algorithm and Data Structure questions, I took it upon myself to read upon a good deal of material before I started interviewing. So I did the usual approach one takes while studying math, understand all the basic concepts and look for places where you could apply them, rather than studying individual problems.<p>Recently I interviewed at one place, where I guess a guy who was just out of college asked a few questions. My general approach is to look for how the problem would fit in the concepts I&#x27;ve learned. I gradually derived the solution out of the concepts I knew. And to my surprise, the solution was simply unacceptable to the interviewer, he just clung to his position that I was wrong. He then proceeded to write the answer, he even wrote the test cases.<p>Now I go back home and check it out of the internet and it was hardly surprising for me to see what I had suspected. The guy didn&#x27;t want the answer to the question. He wanted exactly the same answer he had memorized.

8404309,comment,8403388,8403388,28,0,janson0,,,"Disclaimer: TS Chicago 2014<p>It&#x27;s hard to choose where to start, as this blog post just misses it on so many levels. So, we&#x27;ll just pick &quot;Mentorship Is Not The Primary Focus.&quot;<p>This summer, we had over 150 mentors complete over 650 30m-1hr long mentor meetings with our cohort. On top of these meetings, each company was assigned a super mentor who worked closely with each team for at least an hour a week, throughout the summer. These mentors hail from companies like Groupon, GrubHub, Walmart, etc. and are not just random business people. On top of that, we spent countless hours with Troy, Steve, and Sam throughout the summer... often late into the night.  The passion and care these people and this program exudes towards mentorship and entrepreneurial development is unmatched and, frankly, unquestionable.<p>Second, the assertion by the OP that &quot;the focus on raising capital is just too strong&quot; is curious and reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the program. I concede that if you plan on doing an accelerator, you should most likely be planning to raise further investment capital after the program at some point. (As PG puts it, &quot;A startup is a company designed to grow fast&quot; and from what I see, usually this growth will be accelerated by the injection of capital.) After going through this program, however, I would say the focus in TS Chicago is not mainly on raising capital at all. Rather, it is squarely on building you as an entrepreneur in order to empower you to build your business, equip you to hustle up more traction, and provide you with the tools to raise money to continue accelerating your growth if you want. The leadership goes above and beyond to make themselves available to you throughout the program regardless of the business or personal need.<p>Third, the dilution math is just so bad. Other folks have addressed it in this thread, so I&#x27;m not going to go into detail. But geez.<p>Fourth, looking purely at the &quot;valuation&quot; you get for 6% for $18k is an incredibly short-sighted way to understand the value you are getting out of the program. Mentorship, the network, deep friendships, and core business knowledge are just a few pieces of the value added. But even if you want to add pure money related perks, please review this: <a href=""http://www.techstars.com/program/perks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techstars.com/program/perks/</a>. Such free. Much hosting.<p>Fifth, demo day. At first, I was under the impression that demo day was all about pitching investors my business in the hopes of drumming up some interest in our next round of funding.  After going through that process, my view changed drastically. I am more equipped to explain my business, our purpose, our plan, and the landscape of what we are doing than I would ever have been without it. Not only do I deeply understand the story of my business, but I can articulate it to investors, mentors, customers, and our team with a clarity like never before. I wouldn&#x27;t trade that insanely challenging demo day prep process for anything.<p>Sixth, asking someone a pointed question about the specifics of your business in hopes that they have the answer to it off the cuff with (based on where that point in the interview would have happened) 30 seconds to consider your query is a poor way to judge the quality of their ability to contribute to your business over the lifetime of their involvement.<p>Finally, I&#x27;ll end this discussion with these remarks:<p>TechStars is about relationships and equipping entrepreneurs.

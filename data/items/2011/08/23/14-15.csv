This can be expensive, up to 5% of the purchase price.<p>Another fee that can be expensive is the break fee. This is a fee paid to the acquired company if the deal falls through. This is supposed to prevent the acquirer from getting a thorough look at their competitors books and then walking away.  Typically a break up fee can be 10% of the acquiring price, though in the Google-Motorola acquisition I heard that it's 20% of the purchase price.",1314111566

So far, attempts to bodge STM on to an imperative language that wasn't built with it in mind has not merely been failure, but <i>radical</i> failure. Immense amount of effort by very smart people, followed by the total unusability and unsalvagability of the resulting code.<p>The fact that only place it has been shown to work is basically Clojure and Haskell needs to be addressed; how are you going to address the apparent fundamental incompatibility between imperative languages and STM? And while you may be able to answer that at the VM level (very tiny transactions implemented between opcodes, basically), I would expect it is absolutely hopeless to allow users access to this. How are you going to address the endless-side-effect replay problem? (Hint: You aren't.)<p>This is a kill-PyPy level of dangerous decision, and I think everyone on that team ought to demand a very good answer to that question before buying into this.",1314111560

Set against the backdrop of the Sixties, when feminism reached its zenith, the film expertly depicts the landscape of a tight-knit spiritual community. Inspired by the resonant memoir from Carolyn Briggs (who also wrote the screenplay) the film is an exquisite study of one woman's internal struggle with the primary love relationships in her life. John Hawkes, Donna Murphy, Bill Irwin, Dagmara Dominczyk, and Joshua Leonard round out the cast, along with Farmiga's younger sister Taissa, who proves herself to be an extraordinary new talent as Young Corinne.<p>Actors:\nVera Farmiga\nJoshua Leonard\nJohn Hawkes\nDagmara Dominczyk\nNorbert Leo Butz\nDonna Murphy<p>Director:\nVera Farmiga<p>Writers:\nCarolyn Briggs\nTim Metcalfe\nProducers:\nJonathan Burkhart .... executive producer\nBrice Dal Farra .... executive producer\nClaude Dal Farra .... producer\nRenn Hawkey .... producer\nCarly Hugo .... producer\nLauren Munsch .... executive producer\nJeremy Newmark .... associate producer\nMatthew Parker .... producer\nJon Rubinstein .... producer\nOriginal Music:Alec Puro\nCinematography:Michael McDonough\nFilm Editor:Colleen Sharp\nGenres:Drama\nRelease Date:26 August 2011\nFilming Locations:Kingston, New York, USA\nProduction Companies:-\nBCDF Pictures\nGroup Entertainment, The\nRuminant Films\nDistributors:Sony Pictures Classics\nLanguage:English\nCountry:USA",1314110744

The post to which he was replying said (paraphrased) ""elitism is good, everyone wants to best for themselves and their kin.""  It was clear from the post what temphn meant by elitism.<p>Then scrod came in with the dictionary definition of ""elitism"".  And my point is that people will always favor their family, their friends, people who have been through similarly trying circumstances.  The formation of factions of people who cooperate is inevitable, and some will be successful.  Furthermore the beautiful, the intelligent, the charismatic, the ruthless will always have an advantage over the masses.  Does anyone really want to live in a society that's NOT run by people who are in some way ""the best""?  I understand that some people are against hereditary wealth and privilege, but in a meritocratic society it's just a different set of people who are the elite.  Again I ask, where is the society which is not dominated by an elite?<p>At this point it's impossible to tell if the post was edited, but when I read it last night, I don't recall seeing the phrase ""above all else"". It's not implied by his dictionary definition, so that part of his statement is too strong - ""dominating element"" vs ""above all else"". It's clear that scrod has contempt for any society with an elite (which I again emphasize is every advanced society on earth right now).<p>And then finally the moralizing came in: ""Your attitude is pretty repugnant"", in an attack on a strawman!",1314110151

2916634,comment,2916291,2916291,16,0,arohner,,,"Clojure's STM has several advantages going for it:<p>* Clojure's data structures are purely functional, and built with the STM in mind. Updates and rollbacks to structures are cheap.<p>* Clojure user-level code has always had access to the STM. Because that's the accepted paradigm, There are an order of magnitude fewer assignments in typical clojure code, greatly simplifying the problem. In typical clojure, one function that uses the STM will call 10 pure functions. In typical python, most of those 10 calls will all mutate local state.<p>* Clojure requires all STM activity to happen within the dosync block. In python, that would be like requiring the magic to happen within a ""with transaction(): ..."". Again, this limits the amount of work that needs to happen. The compiler doesn't need to decide whether or not a random function needs to be a transaction; the user will tell the compiler.<p>* Clojure's STM explicitly only works with functional code. This will likely cause fewer leaky abstractions going forward. PyPy will have to modify all existing data structure classes to work with the new STM, and they won't be able to fix all the library and user code out in the world.<p>Good luck to them, but I suspect bolting STM into an existing language is much harder than designing it from scratch, similar to building in GC.",1314109181

If you wrote Sim Farm, it's quite possible you'd want Duck to inherit from Bird and Cow and Pig to inherit from Mammal, and both Bird and Mammal to inherit from Animal.<p>In the course of caring for your farm, you have to fix tractors, grow crops, and care for animals.<p>All Animals must be fed and will starve if they don't. Why would you code ""needs food"" on every individual animal class? Birds can get avian flu, and Mammals can get rabies; the pigs can even get rabies from the dogs. Why would you code ""can get rabies"" on Dog and Pig?<p>Maybe you don't always want to use Sim Farm as your example for teaching OO, but a lot of working code does model real-world items. Animals and cars and such are no worse than files as objects to model, and have the advantage that non-programmers already know something about them.

Garages still have electricity. It could be dedicated for you, or shared with metering. Either way, it&#x27;s pretty straightforward. What can be hard, depending on who you&#x27;re dealing with, is convincing the garage owner to let you do this. As EVs become more common, catering to their owners will become more desirable.

Electronics get better and cheaper with time, and yet, people still buy today. Oil has depreciated hugely in the last months, and yet, people are buying gasoline and heating oil right now, even though signs point to it being even cheaper.<p>Taken together, you have the desire to hoard counterbalanced by these two factors, which creates a balance of hoarding and spending.

You&#x27;re talking about converting the entire US car fleet, developing a non-existent technology, and refining it to the extreme (less than 2 deaths per 100 million miles traveled on average, which is the human driving record right now). It is MUCH, MUCH cheaper to implement a program where you make sure that drunk people leaving bars get into taxis.<p>>It&#x27;s obvious to any observer that driving deaths are a major problem, and that an intensive effort to solve this problem is appropriate. We&#x27;ve made tremendous progress over that last 50 years. Let&#x27;s continue that path.<p>This is disingenuous. Driverless cars are not part of an effort to reduce driving deaths, that&#x27;s just how they&#x27;re being sold.

However, there are a lot of cool things you can do with hardware that looks like it runs your code, even if you don&#x27;t know whether it contains backdoors or not.<p>From the perspective of trying to guarantee security when you don&#x27;t trust manufacturers, there are system-level invariants dictated by the laws of physics: you can be sure, to within measurement precision, that different chips from different manufacturers are not colluding <i>wirelessly</i>, and you can use signal analyzers on the bus to see what is being transmitted in typical operation. This won&#x27;t save you from timebombs, but it gives you some idea of what&#x27;s going on at least, and practically you can expect that unrelated corporations do not have the spare time/money/engineering smarts to invest to collaborate to spy on the users of heterogeneous devices far down the line. So you may not quite be able to trust your CPU, or your modem, or your RAM (well... maybe RAM is regular enough that you could sample and decap and borrow a microscope and see if things look fishy), but you can at least make sure they are behaving generally as CPUs or modems or RAM might at the boundaries between them. If you build a system with enough small chips doing simple tasks, though you&#x27;ll end up with a slow, inefficient thing (think naïve implementations of a microkernel), you no longer need to trust the individual components much as there&#x27;s little room for them to screw you over at a high level.<p>And of course it&#x27;s not true that all of HN is the way I described--it&#x27;s just a distressingly large, or distressingly vocal proportion. I know it&#x27;s at least enough people that projects like OsmocomBB are tragically underfunded, underhyped, and under-hacked-on.",1452818771

It&#x27;s generally only used if a token cannot be used because for instance the token is not stable in value.  So in times of crisis people would fall back to barter as an alternative but when a stable token of exchange exists, barter does not play a role.<p>The first thing that develops in a new community is debt and credit but with regards to if money or barter came first there does not seem to be a lot of agreement.  I personally feel that barter is quite an unnatural concept because one party will most likely always lose.  I cannot imagine that it would come naturally because it&#x27;s a step back from debt and credit.  The only thing it would give you is the ability to trade with someone you don&#x27;t trust.  And that is probably when you tribe meets another tribe which I feel is something that would happen after establishing a local currency.",1452818272
10906125,comment,10903471,10903471,0,0,antihero,,,"I honestly find that the difficulty is <i>maintaining</i> good thought patterns. For instance, on Mondays, I&#x27;m often hungover and on a comedown. Life feels terrible, I&#x27;m unproductive at work, my self-esteem is shot, I basically hate myself. I vow to change everything, go to the gym, to give up drugs and cut down on booze. Awesome. By Wednesday I&#x27;m starting to feel positive - I feel better in myself, things are going well, I&#x27;m productive again and my self-esteem is returning.<p>By Friday, I feel so great, that the emotional memory of how I felt on Monday is all but entirely faded. What was I so worried about? I&#x27;ve had (basically) a great week, and the weekend is upon me - my phone is going off because people want to go do things and get smashed and spend a load of money listening to wicked music in fun, grotty venues and once that starts, I feel lifted and amazing, the party is great! I&#x27;m meeting people, chatting shit, I don&#x27;t want to stop. Afterparty? Hell yes! Afterparties are for the cool kids and going to them makes me a cool kid!<p>Then all of a sudden it&#x27;s 11AM on a Sunday. You&#x27;ve either passed out or all of the substances have worn off, you lug yourself back home, having possibly succeeded at what your altered brain set out to achieve, but have frankly forgotten most of it. You either go to bed Sunday, or get pissed with the people who can&#x27;t face the idea of returning to normality. Either way, in the case of the former you can&#x27;t sleep, and in the case of the latter you pass out and wake up on Monday feeling so terrible that Monday is a write off. You are full of self-loathing and duck your boss&#x27;s calls, then the coworkers your boss thinks you might just be able to handle&#x27;s calls, then you either somehow manage to get into work to be yelled at at 2PM or you just pass out again, wake up at 4, and then have some dazed sort of day and catch some crappy sleep and possibly salvage Tuesday.<p>So that was an extreme example (the life I&#x27;m trying to change, funnily enough), but the point was that it&#x27;s really really difficult to change in any long term meaningful sense when your mind is so ready to forget the reasons you&#x27;re trying to do well. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something as specific as <i>alcoholism</i> or <i>drug addiction</i>, as it&#x27;s a much more broad thing - booze and drugs feel more like a symptom of a certain mindset, as opposed to the things that cause it - I can quite happily (and have, many times) say no to drugs, and I&#x27;ve had liquor on my side for months without touching it (and I can also happily have a few beers without going nuts, too). Perhaps it&#x27;s a symptom of ADHD, perhaps it&#x27;s a crippling poor impulse control and lack of self-discipline, perhaps I&#x27;m a product of my environment (I live in Brighton which is mental as it is, and my main friendship groups tend to hit things <i>hard</i>) I&#x27;m not sure.<p>I&#x27;m just going to keep trying.

The intellectual reason is that a system of learning statistics, experimental design, and a subject matter under the tutelage of a proven expert which requires the person to literally succeed in their job of researching and publishing before even being given the title PhD produces a very high rate of high level success.<p>>Yes, yes it is. Research should not be for a closed shop of inward looking, often archaic and relatively backward academic institutions.<p>IT ISN&#x27;T! Just because you&#x27;re not a part of centralized, systemized education and can&#x27;t access this tool doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t research.<p>You also don&#x27;t have access to a NMR, or an fMRI, or any number of hundreds of others of tools that cost $100k - 1m+, but you can still as a layperson educate yourself and attempt to contribute.<p>But I think to assert that randos-at-home are the literal equivalent of the academic process and PhD&#x27;s is beyond absurd, and that every man should have identical access to what earning an PhD earns you, is also absurd to me.<p>But when it comes to the best tools that cost the most and the best opportunities, those who are a part of the system will get those options. If you want to study medicine you can do that anywhere but if you&#x27;re not apart of a med school getting access to medical cadavers will be difficult.<p>There is so much disrespect for institutions and what we as a people are capable of when we systemize. I understand the appreciation for decentralization and the FOSS model behind technology but there is so often a complete unwillingness to show any respect to any centralization at all, it&#x27;s very strange.",1452818023

Here are the top 100 bitcoin contributors:\n<a href=""https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors</a><p>Guys like Wladimir, Pieter, Gavin, Cory Fields, Gregory Maxwell and Luke Jr have a voice because they’ve contributed many thousands of lines of code. (Lines of code are only a proxy for impact).<p>You may have noticed Mike Hearn isn’t in the top 100 contributors list. He is the primary author of the Java implementation of a bitcoin library:\n<a href=""https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj</a><p>He started it in 2011, definitely early. But a substantial amount of bitcoin core work had already set the path. There are also similar implementations in many different languages but they are not the primary reference implementation for full nodes.<p>According to Hearn’s blog post:\n“I’ve talked about Bitcoin on Sky TV and BBC News. I have been repeatedly cited by the Economist as a Bitcoin expert and prominent developer. I have explained Bitcoin to the SEC, to bankers and to ordinary people I met at cafes.”<p>Being cited by journalists is not the same as being a primary contributor.<p>The disagreement between Hearn and the other developers isn’t about whether to increase capacity, it’s about <i>how</i>. Many of the primary full-node contributors believe a hard-blockchain-fork is a risky approach. Lots of work is being done to explore better options, like segregated witness (<a href=""http://gavinandresen.ninja/segregated-witness-is-cool"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gavinandresen.ninja/segregated-witness-is-cool</a>).<p>Mike Hearn tried to (very aggressively) push the idea of increasing the block size with a hard fork. In fact the patch allows node operators to vote and 75% adoption is needed. When it looked like that wasn’t going to pan out, he created Bitcoin XT where “Decisions are made through agreement between Mike and Gavin, with Mike making the final call if a serious dispute were to arise.”<p>So the claim that Hearn not being able to take over decision making power for the bitcoin community is evidence that bitcoin has failed seems to show something slightly different. It shows that open source software methodology of forking and adoption lets the best implementation win and prevents hostile takeovers.<p>Mike Hearn is not as impactful to bitcoin development as he or recent news would indicate. Mike leaving the bitcoin community has little impact on the future success or failure of bitcoin.",1452816703

You can&#x27;t capture all the value you create. It&#x27;s not how living in a society works. All our culture is based on taking someone else&#x27;s work and changing it, combining with other works and sprinkling a little of your own insight. You can trace every movie ever made back through other movies, then through songs, performances and literature, pretty much back to earliest recorded history. This is partly because &quot;nothing is new under the Sun&quot;, but mostly because works of art are enjoyed within a cultural context. If you quote Shakespeare in your movie, you don&#x27;t do that just because the words feel kind of nice. You&#x27;re both basing off Shakespeare&#x27;s work, and - by doing so - you&#x27;re purposefully making the audience evaluate your movie within the context of Shakespeare&#x27;s writings, which you probably expect to bring them more enjoyment. And Shakespeare did the same by taking from the writings of his predecessors, etc.<p>I like the response to the letter that &#x27;hotgoldminer linked. I appreciate the reality, that artists want to earn money too. Personally, I pretty much don&#x27;t pirate stuff anymore, and I&#x27;m happy to financially support authors (and middlemen, though I&#x27;m not happy about supporting those who are just rent-seeking). But I disagree on the fundamental moral principle. I think that expecting to be paid per copy of an information that&#x27;s copyable pretty much for free is <i>not</i> a moral right. It&#x27;s at best a temporary privilege, though one that people got used to before we had digital technology.",1452816159

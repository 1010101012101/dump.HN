Technically, it was my advisor's job to do it, but he was too busy with non-mundane things, so this kind of work got passed off to his students. None of us were paid for the work, of course. It was just understood that you do it because you have to (grad students need good recommendations, and advisors to those grad students need to play politics with the journal committee). As far as I can tell most editing for most journals is done for free by various university professors and (mostly) their students. More prestigious journals like Nature and Science probably have their own editors do an addition pass after this, but most don't seem to do that.<p>It might be different in some fields, but that's how it works in my field (mechanical engineering), and it seems to be that way in other engineering fields as well.",1358261853

You can argue the toss all you like about hercules, but the fact is that it's not up to scratch for running a proper stack. Saying you can run Z/OS on it with CICS and RACF and DB2 and all the rest to learn is fine, but you try finding half of this stuff.<p>The reason young programmers (and not so young programmers) aren't interested in mainframes is pretty simple, it's largely alien to modern computing users. Mainframes are rarely taught in CS degrees, most people go their entire careers without going near a mainframe and when they do see them, the fundamental concepts (batch rather than interactive, segregating security from the main OS etc.) they recoil in horror.<p>It's also a highly specialist field. Mainframes are typically designed for repetitive tasks with extreme reliability, in the same way that GPUs are designed for specialist programming cases.

However, that happens once per program at the very top. That is a small price to pay for the ability to use all the Python libraries out there.<p>Speaking of libraries. That is one good thing about Python. And probably the reason to stick to it -- the large library ecosystem. Of course it depends on the system you are designing but a large enough system will usually need some other libraries (parsing a protocol, using a work queue etc).<p>Go and Erlang also have plenty, but not nearly the level and breadth that Python has.",1358261714

Think of TCP,  tcp works this way on a small scale. One way to fix the problem is to leverage that to actually open a TCP stream and send data that way. The sender will slow down accordingly.<p>Now if you know that your load is not constant, so there are periods of high activity when inputs are generated then you can try and absorb (and amortize) those high volume peaks using asynchronous queues.",1358261159

They have some pretty awesome hardware, great reliability parameters, and some seriously interesting modes of operation.  You know how we like to throw data at a hadoop cluster and do a lot of big batch map-reduce jobs? A lot of those end up being very similar to the types of batch jobs mainframes are great at. Distributed transactions/shards/etc for our databases? Again, stuff mainframes have been doing for decades.<p>The problem as I see it is access. Sure, like the SO poster mentioned, Hercules exists, but you can't really run modern mainframe OSes on it (legally and easily that is). Further, you can't really get the same experience, because you don't have the hardware offload or partitioning available to you for real.<p>Heck every time I think I should look into the beasts, I can't even find decent technical documentation describing things.<p>Compare most of the stacks people on this site use - there are complaints if the documentation isn't formatted right, let alone if it is incomplete or wrong...<p>I regularly see things people are talking about and/or doing here, and think ""man I think mainframes solved that years ago, it sure would be nice to play around with doing this on a Z series"".  Of course since I can't just do that, I say whatever and play with it on a few linux instances and then can use it myself - with actual knowledge and some experience.<p>This is why I think no one is interested in mainframes: we can't play. We can't say, how can I...? We can't cut our chops by building a million and one little tools that grow up into really helpful software for everyone. We can't just whip out our phones and read about it when we are whiling away our time in line at the coffee shop or futz with things on an airplane.<p>It's that when compared to the availability of software and information of the bazaar, the high priesthood of mainframes with their mysteries and closed access can't provide us with what we need to just build.",1358261137

There's also the fact that modern processors do a lot more per clock than this guy: using 64-bit wide datapaths, and executing multiple instructions every clock cycle rather than taking multiple clock cycles to execute an instruction, and having multiple independent cores.  One rule of thumb is that your performance tends to increase with the square root of the number of transistors you use so you'd expect another 3 orders of magnitude increase in performance from the 6 orders of magnitude more transistors, for a modern chip being 6 orders of magnitude faster at executing some algorithm overall (if there's a normal amount of parallelism to extract).<p>Now, normally you have to worry about increasing clockspeeds having diminishing returns, since memory latency remains constant despite a faster CPU clock.  But anything that could run on the amount of RAM the 6502 could handle would fit in a modern processor's L1 cache, and the scheduler is perfectly able to hide L1 latency so I think ignoring this factor is fair in this case.",1358260626

Like I mentioned in another comment, basically the whole CPA industry is going belly up and will continue to do so in 2013.<p>So how do these guys make money? Well I know the biggest craze is to make toolbars that actually control your Facebook/Twitter/Email accounts. I've already seen one made for chrome and the guy had put a whosamungus tracking code in there that had over 10k people online at the time I checked it.<p>The toolbar was capable of sending mass private messages, posting on your wall and inviting all your friends to events on Facebook. And the problem is, it's pretty tough for Facebook to block this since it looks legitimate as the actions are directly coming from the browser and not a shady 3rd party site.<p>Another tactic which is more common is to replace websites advertising code with their own. This means replacing Adsense ID's or completely changing the banner code all together. This is what Kim Dotcom will be doing when he launches his new Mega site this week.<p>They also alter Google results so they can either promote their own sites or sell traffic to advertisers for profit.<p>So to think they are 'only' tracking your IP/Mac address, think again...",1358260189

One of my first UNIX accounts was on a CDC Cyber 205 (shortly before it got decommissioned, I'm not <i>that</i> old) and an ETA 10P supercomputer.  The hardware solutions Cray and others came up with to things like cooling (inert liquid fluorocarbon?), wiring looms, etc. were amazing.  All but the largest mainframes were kind of boring by comparison.<p>Modern virtualization covers most of the interesting parts of mainframes.  There was a lot of weirdness with asymmetric multiprocessing (channel processors for storage, etc.), but a lot of that is fundamentally uninteresting since it is dealing with special cases in an inelegant way.  One of the more interesting parts of mainframes were Tandem and other redundant/fault tolerant systems, with multiple processors executing the same instructions in parallel to compare output.  I don't know what the state of the art is for that -- obviously in the normal open systems Internet world you could just do this at the application level with multiple machines, but chip/instruction level redundancy might get used more in embedded systems.  Conceptually really interesting.<p>The other really interesting hardware areas, to me, are FPGAs/network ASICs, and HSMs.  Trusted Computing, specifically enhancements to EFI, Intel TXT, etc. are all really interesting too.",1358258748

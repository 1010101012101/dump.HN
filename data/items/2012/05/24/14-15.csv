Granted the circumstances were different - they're much newer companies and they needed experienced executives to grow - but it shows that sometimes these things make sense.<p>The growing M&A team Lashinsky describes is a good case in point.  Cook handled that when they had a fraction of the $110 Billion they have today. They started adding specialists when Google swooped in and acquired AdMob, and have done well since (Siri, Anobit, Chomp).  Considering how much more competitive the talent market has become, this strikes me as perfectly logical.",1337871572

I can't stress how much it helps to get a nice workout in 5 times/week and how much more energy you have throughout.<p>2) Get a sitting/standing desk. After I'm in the office all day, I don't want to sit. I got one myself one of these: geekdesk.com and find a more constant energy level after I get home, and I only use the sitting positions maybe 10% of the time.<p>3) Turn off wifi or install a ""site blocker"" for time-wasters. I know this sounds silly, but after a long day of work, twitter, FB, and HN all sound OOHHH so pleasant to check, refresh, rinse, repeat. After an hour has passed, an hour has been wasted.<p>4) Stop sending yourself articles. I did the same, but it ends up just piling up. Put everything you do and read into manageable tasks that take <1 hour and you'll be good.<p>5) Google seinfeld's productivity method. Another one of those ""silly but it works"" things.",1337871565

At least us developers want to have static desks.<p>* The kitchen, the new location has a separate lunch restaurant but we have a small kitchen as well. Currently we have a rotating list who's responsible for keeping the kitchen clean every day (the housekeeper only drops by twice a week) but it just doesn't work that well as people don't prioritize it or are away from the office at a customer.<p>* Rules on how and when you can disturb someone.

Maybe you'd like higher pay/greater compensation. Do you have the bargaining power for greater pay? Would asking for greater pay indicate dissatisfaction to your employer? Maybe you don't want to communicate dissatisfaction. So maybe it's best to just say that everything is fine and keep working until you find a better position.<p>So maybe now you've found another position with more compensation. Do you hold a proverbial gun to your employer's head and say ""greater compensation or I leave""? Is there any acceptable way of asking for more with no real way of promising anything in return?<p>I appreciate your efforts in trying to keep the lines of communication open, but maybe if you want information, you should give some in return. Something like ""we still have $100k left to spend in employee benefits. How would you like this allocated? Pay? Insurance plan? Company party?"" Or maybe you can offer choices. ""Would you rather we increase 401k matching by 3%? Increase pay by 1%? etc"" And obviously give them time to respond (so that they can consider things, discuss things, etc) It might be a pain, but if that's still not acceptable, and you still want more data, I doubt you'll get data asking directly from your employees what amounts to ""do you want more stuff?"" and ""what more stuff do you want?"".<p>If you find success with something though, whether it was something I suggested or not, please let us know!",1337870934

I do not do electronics for my job and I do not have a lot of free time.  So, I've found three things to be effective at maximizing my happiness:<p>1. Have multiple projects on the go at once.<p>I've found that building multiple things at once enables me to best make use of my available time and resources (such as the equipment/components I have and spare money).  One of the projects will usually have some portion that I can spend time on, or research, or buy something for.  This is especially true of the researching part.<p>Depending on my mood I will either (a) not work on the projects at all since there are plenty of other valuable things to do (such as cooking, interacting with people, exercising) or (b) pick from the available choices the one that I'm most in the mood for (e.g. tonight I'd like to finish that amplifier, or tonight I need to read up on X).<p>2. Don't worry about when they get completed.<p>This has made me achieve more not less.  The more I worried I wasn't completing things the more I stressed myself out and set unrealistic deadlines and then missed them and got upset.  Going slow has helped.<p>3. Pick work that fits in the available time.<p>I might have an entire evening free, or I might have 20 minutes.  There's usually something from the multiple projects that will fit in that available time.<p>For example, when I worked on my high-altitude balloon project GAGA-1(2) it took me a 9 months of grabbing an hour here, an evening there.  The result was fantastic and I don't feel bad about it having taken 9 months instead of a month of total cramming.<p>(1) <a href=""http://jgc.org/labs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jgc.org/labs.html</a>\n(2) <a href=""http://blog.jgc.org/2011/04/gaga-1-flight.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jgc.org/2011/04/gaga-1-flight.html</a>",1337870483

I know that my energy level drops like a rock at 16h and doesn't really come back until about 20h. So I take care of stuff that doesn't require massive energy in that gap and try to protect my second energy burst of the day for getting other stuff done.<p>As for the articles you've emailed yourself, I find it quite often the case that I no longer have enthusiasm a few hours later to read something that seemed interesting at first glance. The best solution there is not to read it and find something better.<p>I also find that it helps to schedule a block of time for a particular project. For example, I'm typesetting a book for some friends of mine. On my calendar for yesterday evening was to put the chicken on to roast and then typeset while it roasted until other friends came over for dinner at 7. The broccoli and sweet potatos required some time, but not much focused attention, so I could keep the state of the typesetting in my head while I did prep work and then go back to it when things were cooking.<p>You also may be using up your capacity for certain kinds of thought (e.g., programming and mathematics) at work.

The first is, as mentioned above, that you're probably overestimating the effort required to switch platform at this point. The second is that a good programmer who just happens to have no/limited experience with Ruby will probably be able to adapt pretty fast, provided he has experience with similar technologies. By limiting your search to those that already know Ruby well, you're avoiding a lot of potential.<p>But the main reason why I think it's a bad idea, is because you are making decisions that I believe is the domain of a CTO to make.

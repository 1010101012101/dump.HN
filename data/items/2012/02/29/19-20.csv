Like you said, pet owners find it difficult to locate trustworthy sources for this sort of thing, and many we talked with would prefer to go direct to friends, family, etc., but asking for help in those cases sucks. Non-pet-owners we talked with said they really want to help/ hangout with cool pets, but they simply don't get asked. We want to fix that issue first, so we make those connections easier to make by having coordination in one place, and helping to remove the ""awkward"" in asking for help. We want asking for help from friends to be as easy or easier than picking up the phone to call a kennel.<p>I mentioned in another comment here, but we're definitely thinking about ways we can grow each user's graph beyond direct friends, including some elements similar to LinkedIn (e.g. your direct friends giving an endorsement to their friends, so when you see a friend of friend come up as an option for help, you see 5 other direct friends have vouched for that person and their love/ ability to watch dogs). We envision something similar for professionals as well.<p>We're really excited about the possibilities here!

I think e-mail is a lot more effective as it's faster and can be automated where cold calling simply can't be automated and no one likes getting called on the phone when they're doing something else. Everyone works off of e-mail these days.<p>And I've done both, I've had way better results with cold e-mails, 1 meeting out of 50 emails is probably about right for the first time, if he e-mails everyone two more times that number will go up a bit.  <i>Particularly</i> if he's not selling anything. If I'm running a business, why would I want to meet with a guy who just wants to talk about my business? I'd rather meet with someone that at least claims to know my business and is working on a vague new product and wants to get my feedback on it.",1330544416

Operationally the team is excellent, the company is growing well (almost 60 people now between two offices) and my services aren't really required for operational issues.

If your investment philosophy is ""I want to make decent returns without researching companies or exploring financial statements"" then indexing is the right approach.<p>Note however that the choice between ""smart investing"" and ""hyperactive investing"" is a false dilemma.

Solin's comments on the marketplace of financial experts is right, but indexing isn't the only way to avoid that mess.<p>Sure, 80% of my portfolio is in a couple of indexes, but that other 20% I don't count as mad money.

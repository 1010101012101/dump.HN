The NSA is being accused in this article of hacking Huawei and stealing their source code in order to develop better exploits for Huawei equipment.  Huawei was accused of:<p>1) using stolen Cisco source code to gain a competitive market advantage by not having to spend money on R&D.  So far, no one has shown evidence that the US government has given any stolen Huawei code to private companies.<p>2) Huawei was owned by people with close ties to the Chinese government and military.  Members of Congress raised concern that if they were allowed to provide equipment for large portions of the US telecommunications infrastructure, it would give ample opportunity for the Chinese intelligence services/ military to put backdoors in.",1395529116

7451239,comment,7450601,7450601,31,0,jwmerrill,,,"Here&#x27;s a gist that optimizes the author&#x27;s Julia code to give a 4x speedup over the unvectorized code, and handily beat the vectorized codes too:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/jwmerrill/9715447"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jwmerrill/9715447</a><p>In general, carefully written devectorized Julia will be faster than equivalent vectorized code because it is possible to avoid allocating containers at intermediate stages of the computation. This is surprising for people coming from e.g. Matlab, R, or Numpy, because vectorized code is often faster in those environments. In those languages, direct scalar code is slow, and vectorization is about expressing the computation in a form that will call out to fast C operations, but the C still pays a price to allocate intermediates. In Julia, the JIT is able to emit fast machine code for scalar operations, so you don&#x27;t need to express your code in a form that calls out to C. There are JIT compilers for Matlab and Python too, but Julia&#x27;s JIT is very high quality and everyone uses it all the time.<p>The main changes I made here were hoisting computations of constants out of the loop, and preallocating a 2D Float64 array to hold the results. These were worth roughly 2x each. I&#x27;ve chosen the storage format so that it is accessed in column order. Both optimizations have their own sections in the Julia Manual&#x27;s performance tips section:<p><a href=""http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/performance-tips/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/performance-ti...</a>",1395528882

They also try to get a discount on salaries by offering stock, which is usually pretty worthless in the final analysis.<p>I personally freelance full time. Once you establish yourself and get a reputation as someone who can get things done it can be a great career; if you stay pretty busy (last year I was working for probably 9 months, 6 of it onsite someplace and the rest spread out between a few different gigs) you can earn significantly more than at most &quot;real&quot; jobs and have lots of free time to work on your own projects or just go on vacation.

That&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s so hard to make money with a product primarily tailored to the needs of intermediate and advanced learners.  Learner attrition means that most people attracted by the idea of language learning don&#x27;t make it that far.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Readlang briefly and thought the look of the site was much nicer than the clunky interface sported by LingQ, but I still didn&#x27;t feel ready to make free reading a major part of my study as a ~B1+ self-learner of Spanish.  Most texts for natives, even children&#x27;s books like Harry Potter, are still very slow/difficult to read at my current level.<p>Import tools are nice, but the content I stumble on is often too hard for me to read efficiently.  What I really need is help finding stuff I like that is only ~5% unknown words so I can read more fluidly/enjoyably.  I&#x27;m not sure how to tackle the problem, but if you can crack the content discovery nut it will make the tool more accessible to lower level language students at the &quot;widest&quot; portion of the language learning funnel.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that Readlang seems very &quot;quiet&quot;.  Other platforms like Duolingo and LingQ have active user forums where people can share their experiences and problems.  It&#x27;d be nice to have a discussion place to swap suggestions, get encouragement, and (most important) see testimonials/success stories.<p>Anyway, good luck.  I hope the product is still around when I&#x27;m more advanced and ready to make reading a bigger part of my study.",1395526441

Although everything seems clear and simple, it is a representation I simply could not wrap my head around. It&#x27;s like when you learn a new language: I know &quot;libro&quot; means &quot;book&quot; in spanish but I cannot associate it with the concept of a book, until I move to spain and speak the language.<p>Then I got my new job. New git workflow and I had to use branches and rebasing in the field on an hourly basis. And ever since, everything clicked. Now that I see this link again, it is not only clear, it feels like I speak the language.<p>All in all, I think this is a great piece of work, but pedagogically speaking, I think of it more as a visual cue to pair with the git actions <i>when you do them</i> than something to rely on.",1395526337

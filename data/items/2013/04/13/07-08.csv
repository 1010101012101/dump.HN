But there's also virtuous laziness, which is the desire to do work in the most efficient way possible. People who work like that often tend to be assets because they invent all of the stuff that leads to everything running smoothly and with a minimal amount of effort.",1365839976

5542868,comment,5500352,5502784,1,0,e12e,,,"I don't believe that's a correct interpretation of the AGPL. It's intent is to extend the idea of ""User right to run"" the software to services (like eg a web server or a web app) -- in other words -- say you make a webmail system, release it under the AGPL. Users of your webmail system would then be entitled to the source, just as users of a GPLed mail program would be entitled to the source (under the GPL).<p>The basic idea is to avoid someone taking something like a web server, heavily build on it, and set up a big service running it -- but not providing the modifications back to the users of the service (and eg: leaving them ""out in the cold"" if the service shuts down). Or in this case -- if you fork pinry, that's fine -- but your users are entitled to the source and your modifications (note <i>your users</i> not <i>everyone</i>).<p>I think it's a perfectly valid licence, and appropriate for stuff like this, where you could take pinry, set it up as a service, slap some ads on it, and make money off of the value created by pinry's authors. Nothing wrong with that. But if you find and fix bugs, those fixes have to be contributed back to at least your users (which then again are free to redistribute them under the AGPL, making it likely that they find their way back to the original project).",1365839441

It seems like the design spec work. I find it horendous that people do work for a company and most of them never get paid for it. It is disgusting. The top #1 in Kaggle according to the article only got paid 6 times. Lets put it into perspective. Companies that wanted web developers stopped hiring them and started using a similar service, in which, everyone would create a version of the application, with only the frontend available for other contestants, in order to foster competition. Then the company chose the best one and only the winning team would get paid. This is capitalism at its worst, and long-term it is severely harmful. In a modern work-rights aware society this should be illegal, spec work that is... At least the communities should critic it in my opinion and not embrace it.",1365839120

Knowing whats going on can be difficult to discern without a deep understanding of the overall system, and bugs have a tendency to hide in obscure places.<p>And speaking of assembly, Forth <i>is</i> essentially assembly code for a virtual stack machine. Or an actual stack machine.<p>Ive been idly working on a statically typed concatenative language for a long time now, partly because I intend it to be taken seriously sometime in the next decade, but mostly as a learning experience.

By confronting them, you'll only force them to worsen their behaviour in defence at which point they might condemn or criticise you unfairly, leaving you with a lower opinion of yourself undeservedly. You also run the risk of having your reputation harmed.<p>So for your own happiness, no matter how tempting, generally it's better to avoid confrontation with the ones that don't have the willingness or capacity to change.",1365837402

My office has both and yet, they never get used. If you try to use them during the day, you're told it's too much of a distraction and you should get back to work. You pretty much have to wait until the boss goes home for the day.",1365837384

Although the rationalization for it sounds rather contrived - to me at least any of these explanation would sound at least as plausible:\n1) The sudden vertical movement may cause a predator that is used to tracking its prey horizontally to lose sight of the specific animal in the flock, thus making it harder to run it down.\n2) Statistically, the jump may prove to evade a certain percentage of pounces from the predator, that happen to coincide with it.\n3) The split second of ""rest"" while in the air allows the muscles to ""recharge"" enough energy to enable another small sprint, thus giving the antelope a lifeline.\n4) ""Look, I could just as well be kicking you in the head if you get too close""",1365837250

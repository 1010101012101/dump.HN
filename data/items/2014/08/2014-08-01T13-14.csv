Corollary: Explaining why despite having delivered the application once without testing once, it does not mean testing is useless.<p>Explaining that our testing is not useless because the client found a bug.<p>Explaining that it is normal that we get some specification wrong and need to change them after further discussion with the client. No we do not need to fire the BA.<p>Explaining why, despite coding our apps &quot;by the spec&quot; we still need to schedule some integration testing.<p>Explaining that public shaming of a developer that committed a bug is counterproductive.<p>Explaining that the priority on task to LOW allow us to know what task will not be done if running out of budget.

We use VSO for our SCM, product backlog, work items, etc. We have segregated environments that follow our SDLC: Dev, Test, UAT (staging), and Prod.<p>An understandable reaction might be that the team composition I describe is a bit atypical/not ideal. I&#x27;m working towards building the team to have clearer separation of concerns as well as bringing on a full-time Software Test Analyst.<p>Team responsibilities:\n- Supporting over 200 customers: this ranges from various levels of data ETL complexity, to customized development change requests to our internal systems and/or integration projects between our systems and theirs. In many cases, we become an adopted dev team since a given customer may be so small that they have no dev resources. Or, some larger customers say they&#x27;ll have to wait years to get X project done through their internal IT, so they turn to us to get it done in weeks or months.\n- Supporting our internal departments: This is Help Desk tickets, internal Change Requests,CAPA responses, etc. 30% of my team&#x27;s time is dedicated to this internal support on a weekly basis.\n- New development: we have a large product backlog. Shiny object syndrome is real and something I continue to reduce through education, metrics, etc. Dev efforts that need to be dedicated to our internal operations department are neglected for months on end because of some new customer project, partner alliance, etc.\nIt&#x27;s this last bit I struggle with finding ways to improve upon (deadlines, higher quality, clearer requirements). In Oct 2013 we moved away from a waterfall dev methodology to Agile. In a nutshell, I learned that Agile really doesn&#x27;t fit well on teams that have a lot of maintenance/support.

Haskell is presented by its neophytes as some uber-arcane thing that cannot be understood by a mere average programmer, you have to learn algebra first!, and read all Martin-Lof, and whatever else. And it hampers adoption of the language by many other people who might be offended by such superiority attitudes.<p>However, it is much healthier to present Haskell as simply a tool for writing better and safer code, which is frequently easier to reason about than your conventional for-loops all the way down. So everyone should try it, and say for themselves.<p>I may be wrong and over-generalizing here, but Haskell is a very convenient vehicle for showing off and belittling others. And honestly, who does not want to stick Haskell somewhere in their CV just to look better nowdays? Being fancy has a cost for the language. This is not an intrinsic fault of Haskell.

As in 30 tiny projects, aiming to generate $500 each?<p>Your problem seems to be a recurring theme here on HN and elsewhere. People building amazing stuff (as in intellectually stimulating, fun to build, difficult to do, impressive etc.) with amazing technology (shiny new languages, stacks etc.), launch it and yet nobody seems to care. Nobody seems to be willing to throw money at an app, service and so on. Why is that? People often build things that solve non-issues. And I love all of this, 99.5% of the stuff I build is purely for fun, learning, play and prove something (to myself). But that&#x27;s not where the money is most of the time, though the things I learn from play are useful for the 0.5%.<p>I&#x27;m sure you read everything there is to know about the entire lean thing (Business Model Generation got mentioned already). Are you familiar with the work of Dane Maxwell [1]? As jasonswett wrote, the money is in the boring stuff. Dane Maxwell developed a robust and proven framework to help bootstrapped businesses with hands-on advice and mentoring. I highly recommend to have a look at his work and look up some of the success stories. It&#x27;s very inspiring and you can learn a thing or two. His advice is more in the tune of people like DHH (you&#x27;re much more likely to succeed in building a small company that solves a specific problem than, say, the next Facebook). Does it seem achievable for you to build an app with 50 users who pay €150 each? Or with 100 users who pay $70 each? Would you be happy with something like this for a start?<p>Pick something that solves a real problem in an area where there&#x27;s money. B2B that is. Pick something that bothers you when you interact with other businesses as a starting point. Why is there friction? Work from there. Talk to those businesses and ask them what their biggest pain points are. What they would be willing to pay for if somebody (you) would solve it. You will have to pick up the phone, write emails and talk to people in person. That&#x27;s all scary stuff (at least for me). You will be surprised what businesses are struggling with. Which things eat up tons of their resources and could be solved with open source solutions that you simply glue together. Once you find something that you think you can solve, nail the business owners down on it. Demand commitment. Make them part of the process and work closely with them. They will become your evangelists later on. Make them pay for a year in advance. That will truly validate your business idea. Only then start to build.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thefoundation.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thefoundation.com</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Athefoundation.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Athefoundation.com</a> *<p>* The website is built in a way that it&#x27;s hiding some of the content.

I was deluded into thinking &quot;I would do this different&quot;.

So I do side projects programming things I want to do, the way I want to do it to keep my skills up to date.<p>The other thing I think I&#x27;m realizing is that being a manager is sort of generic role.  Most career paths forward at this point look rather boring and mundane.  Even if it is a new project - some sort of skunkworks effort - using some new tech and solving really cool problems - managing that isn&#x27;t much different than managing a team maintaining a 10 year old system.   Maybe morale is easier to manage.<p>Think about what your next position would be after taking a management role - your options become limited.

All the tutorials in the world weren&#x27;t helping it click for me.<p>But then somehow I finally understood that Haskell is (trying its best to be) Math. I had a deeply mistaken idea of what math is and I thought I &quot;hated&quot; it and that any kind of advanced math is too hard for me. I have failed Calculus before, though I&#x27;ve always done well in discrete math.<p>It was only when I realized that math begins (or does it?) with what you have (objects, sheep, anything you want to count) and what you can do with them (group, make a set, join two sets, etc). Then I went into a reading spree about all ofthose very basic and foundational aspects of pure math (pure as in &quot;look around you, you can count things, you can group them based on some trait, you can do operations based on groups, you can now think of those groups as the entities to focus on, you can prove certain properties about those groups, etc&quot;) and I found it amazing that so much can be known and discovered from starting with just what you see around you.<p>When I understood that math starts with just looking around you then I finally made peace with math, and I saw that it was good, that it was here to help me. Then I looked at Haskell again, and suddenly Void, Unit, Either, Maybe, they all made perfect sense. Maybe is a function that takes your set and gives you a new set that looks the same, but has a special entity that means &quot;the lack of an entity in this set&quot;; in other words, Maybe adds a zero to a type. It&#x27;s simple and easy for me when I choose to see it that way. Everything is a lot more concrete and I have even drawn all these concepts and they map very well to visual ideas. So many things in Haskell are recurring themes (like adding a zero, starting things with a &quot;one&quot; entity, etc) that if you have a good relationship with math, many things fall into place just nicely.<p>But I started Haskell hating math and that has held me back so much. So my advice would be to never deny that Haskell is math, but to explain what&#x27;s so awesome about math, how it gives us so much certainty even if we only assume very basic and seemingly obvious statements. I could have used some rough advice like &quot;listen, stop whining about math, you&#x27;re wrong about what you think math is, it&#x27;s much more fundamental and it&#x27;s a tool to help you organize any set of ideas you have, so why would you not apply that to programming?&quot;",1406899870

I thought I&#x27;d throw some questions at you to think about (and maybe you have already).<p>1. What will you do if something breaks? (As the saying goes, if a mover tells you he&#x27;s never broken anything, he&#x27;s either lying to you or it&#x27;s his first day).<p>2. What will you do to protect yourself against mistaken/fraudulent damage claims? (i.e. Buyer/Seller claims you scratched the DR table, but you didn&#x27;t).<p>3. How will you load your truck to maximize space efficiency? The more things you can store on the truck, the more things you can put up for auction. As a mover, the first thing I put into the truck is the last thing I take off [0]. But you can&#x27;t do this as to the dynamic nature of your business. You always need access to everything on the truck...which is surprisingly harder than it seems.<p>4. What will you do with breakables (i.e. china, glasses, lamps etc)? Different animal than furniture.<p>5. If I&#x27;m selling a large ticket item, why would I use your service? For example, let&#x27;s say I bought a couch for $2000 last year and now I want to sell it. I should be able to fetch $1000 for it. If I&#x27;m patient, I could probably get as much as $1700.

8119572,comment,8118696,8119549,0,0,nbouscal,,,"> A truly open-minded position would have to continually consider that maybe Haskell and its type system are not the best options at all<p>There are two ways that I can parse this comment. The first is that you mean that there are other, newer options out there that will turn out to be better than Haskell. This, almost all Haskellers would agree with: most of us have more than a passing interest in e.g. Idris, Agda, Shen, etc.<p>The other reading is that you mean that other established paradigms are better options (A third reading is that there is no such thing as better, but for that I&#x27;ll just point you to pg&#x27;s classic Blub essay). This is a good thing to consider once, but I strongly disagree with considering it continually. Once you&#x27;ve made the comparison, if you come to the conclusion that one tool is better than another, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to continue that comparison forever. It may make sense to revisit it from time to time as you grow in your understanding of the task and the context, but at some point your posterior probability of the other tool being better must grow so low as to no longer be worth investigation. For many Haskellers, the comparison between a Haskell-like type system and dynamic typing is this kind of comparison. My posterior probability of dynamic typing being a better choice is less than one percent, so it makes no sense for me to continue reevaluating that option.<p>If the latter is what you mean, I can&#x27;t disagree that it is a truly open-minded position, I can only point you to a quote by the inimitable Tim Minchin: &quot;If you open your mind too much, your brain will fall out.&quot;",1406898520

8119570,comment,8118696,8118696,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think there&#x27;s a lot of value in this article (which really isn&#x27;t about Haskell; but more generally about being in the top 5% of programming). I can&#x27;t disagree with the idea that we should show more open-mindedness toward different approaches and civility to new entrants.<p>That said, I&#x27;m going to take a different tack, not because the OP is wrong, but just to explore a second orthogonal component.<p>As programmers, we have both a weak and a submissive tribal identity. That&#x27;s a problem, and we should change it. I call it &quot;weak&quot; because we aren&#x27;t good judges of who belongs and who doesn&#x27;t. The true bad guys (and, yes, they are quite <i>bad</i> and we must oppose them) have been commoditizing engineering work for decades by flooding the market with low-skill, untrained, &quot;software engineers&quot; (ScrumDrones, CommodityJavaDevelopers, etc.) in order to reduce top talent&#x27;s leverage in the market. It has created this mythology that talent and skill don&#x27;t matter, and while it&#x27;s completely wrong, the failures are delayed enough that the bad actors in the business can be promoted away from the problem until shit breaks.<p>Our fatal flaw? Instead of striking the bad actors in the business world, we attack those low-skill engineers, who might be infuriatingly incompetent, but really didn&#x27;t do anything wrong. (&quot;You&#x27;re just a PHP retard, so shut the fuck up.&quot;) The true bad guys don&#x27;t really care what happens to the CommodityScrumDrones, and that&#x27;s the point of having them is that they&#x27;re disposable. By attacking <i>them</i>, the unskilled pawns, we gain nothing. Sure, they&#x27;re incompetent and may be anti-intellectual (or, more likely, they just don&#x27;t give a shit about programming and shouldn&#x27;t be programmers, but aren&#x27;t stupid or bad people). But the anti-intellectualism we must fight is that of the businessmen who are driving us in to the ground.<p>I say it is a submissive tribal identity because this divide-and-conquer game <i>works</i>. Dysfunctional organizations and societies usually form three classes that matter. (There are subclasses within each related to prestige factors that don&#x27;t matter.) The High must keep the Middle and Low at odds with each other, lest they band together and overthrow the High.<p>In order to depress programmer wages and working conditions, the bad guys prevent professionalization and collective bargaining, create startup mythologies in order to make business bad actors look like real technologists, and flood the market with commodity programmers (the Low). Amazingly, the more skilled programmers (the Middle) will, driven by their disgust in sharing working conditions with the Low, actually work unreasonably hard and clean up their messes, just to out-compete them in a game that doesn&#x27;t really matter (the unskilled are never fired, and the overworked are rarely promoted). When this works as designed, they turn into the Clueless layer of the MacLeod model.<p>We <i>have</i> to fight the anti-intellectualism. We&#x27;ve let ourselves be typecast to <i>business subordinates</i> rather than technologists and it&#x27;s goddamn fucking disgusting. When some businessman says &quot;languages don&#x27;t matter&quot;, we have to humiliate him for his stupidity and anti-intellectualism, before he feels empowered enough to start hiring commodity engineers. We do have to fight, and we have to get nasty, and we have to crush our enemies. But we also have to stop clawing <i>at each other</i> over petty differences (e.g. tabs vs. spaces) and focus on the battles that matter.",1406898415

People who read CodingHorror are concerned about the security issues...but how many of your users even know what the hell CodingHorror is?""</i><p>If the topic being debated was about the blog in it's entirety and why Jeff Atwood writes it, you might have an argument here, but considering two people pointed to a blog entry I'm going to disagree wholeheartedly with everything you just said.<p>The article makes a VERY good point that some folks very often use their email password as the de facto password throughout the Internet.  Just because someone comes along and eloquently it's a bad practice doesn't mean people are automatically NOT going to do it, and immediately become 
more informed to privacy and security concerns.<p>And even for people who don't use the same password, they just as easily don't want this information just flying across a random connection string for the sake of seeing what your ""friends"" are up to on this new socially-capable website.<p>It's not about ""Who reads this random arsed blog"" any more than it is keeping in mind every avenue of user interaction that will occur on your site, and being accountable for how you use data given to you.",1214047959

The numbers are approximate, but close in my case, i don't know how i survived 6 years of cartoon network. And its nice to see that Einstein was wrong for something, makes him more human.",1214047770

If they have almost any kind of blog or social networking profile these days, it's also an OpenID.<p>Users remember their OpenIDs.  Use the discovery mechanisms built into the spec to do the hard part for them.<p>Check out the RESTful apis being built as part of the OpenSocial specification.  If they can tell you what network they're a part of that supports OpenSocial (Google, MySpace, hi5, Plaxo, and soon, Yahoo) then you'll be able to kick off an OAuth process that ends in them giving you permission to fetch their friendlist.<p>But their email username and password?  Don't <i>ever</i> do it.<p>We're past that stage now.  It's no longer state of the art, and it's dangerous enough that it ought to be considered harmful by all responsible adults.",1214047050

It&#x27;s as if those that use the anthropic priniple in this sense have a very shallow understanding of Epistemology and/or Philosophy of Science.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that the question concerns at least one level deeper than what the &quot;anthropic principle&quot; attempts to answer.

Add in requirements for access roads, equipment, human habitations and support, and that&#x27;s going to increase, though I&#x27;m not sure by how much -- 10% to 30% wouldn&#x27;t surprise me.<p>Built as a corridor, 30 million acres is 1000 miles x 47 miles -- an assembly of grow tanks stretching 25 miles on either side of an highway running from Chicago to Denver.  Though more likely it would be situated in a desert region (so as not to compete with existing agriculture), but where it <i>would</i> compete with alternative direct electrical (or electricity-to-fuel) alternatives.<p>Even if the area doesn&#x27;t require freshwater access, it will require <i>water</i>, and for that to be transported (likelihood of occupying thousands of miles of coastline are slim) considerable distances inland, and then back out again (waste streams and salt).  All of which are both capital and operationally intensive.<p>Building sea-based structures would similarly be insanely capital intensive.  You&#x27;d be better off finding a way to create an inland salt lake (say:  in the Dead Sea or Death Valley) and situate your grow-ponds there.<p>Marine or even simply salt-water environments are very, very harsh and hard on structures (even concrete) and equipment.",1397786328
7607608,comment,7607020,7607020,10,0,mturmon,,,"From the article:<p><i>[Katsu] pioneered the fire extinguisher spray can, which has permitted him to expand the scale of his art by orders of magnitude. He famously demoed it at &quot;Art in the Streets,&quot; a 2012 show at the the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, when, without invitation, he left his multi-story calling card on the side of the museum.</i><p>The part of the story that is not mentioned is that this show was very well-attended (it&#x27;s graffiti! it&#x27;s art! it&#x27;s hip!), but very controversial in an LA art world that is quite accepting of out-of-the-box concepts.  This show and shows like it precipitated the resignation of all the artists on the MOCA board, and then caused the departure of the museum director, Jeffrey Deitch, who had championed the show.<p>The reason this is worth mentioning is that the article is playing in to the same rather thoughtlessly &quot;transgressive&quot; narrative about graffiti being, in itself, a serious contribution to the art world.  What we actually have here is an interesting tech demo of novel ways to apply spray paint.  But, what is the artistic contribution of this work?  What is this cultural intervention on the part of Katsu trying to accomplish?  (Or put another way, &quot;Why are you calling this art?  What cultural effect do you want to achieve?&quot;)<p>All he talks about in the interview is (a) some rather tired reasoning about the paint effects offered by the new method of application, and (b) some uninteresting claims about reclaiming the drone in the name of artistic expression.<p>This is hip and meme-abundant, but I don&#x27;t see how it seriously contributes to culture.",1397786323

In C, a for loop is internally reduced to a goto after the code is transformed into a syntax tree (manipulated by a non-standard and ad-hoc macro implementation). The difference here is that C must first make the syntax tree before it reduces the tree while CL reduces it immediately (since lisp code is already a tree).<p>All languages must reduce to a limited ISA of primitives (or conversely, all HLL are built on small ISAs). Lisp does a lot of this conversion early on (because it can) while C does this much later (because it can&#x27;t do it early). You&#x27;re simply quibbling about how soon to do this conversion. LLVM does the same thing as lisp in that it reduces a seemingly large language into a small set of constructs (and then works to optimize this small core language). I would argue that a smaller core language is better because it is easier to reason about and easier to optimize.<p>As to embedded, iRobot corporation created a lisp variant called L (based on a subset of common lisp) to use on their embedded processors via a bytecode VM.<p><a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/pubpg/luv95.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/pubpg/luv95.pdf</a><p>Check out shen lisp (link below).

The performance cost of that has gotten better as time has gone on, but I wonder how many transistors (and how much power) CPUs are burning for that mitigation. The &quot;how computers actually work&quot; digression originally had a section on context switches, but I removed it early on because I felt like that section was dragging.<p>To try to paint a very rough picture of the larger thoughts from which this talk was taken: I think that microkernels and the actor model are both the right thing (most of the time). When implemented naively, they both happen to take a big penalty from context switch cost. But Erlang can host a million processes in its VM, and we&#x27;re using VMs for almost everything now anyway.<p>The obvious (to me) solution is to move both the VM and an Erlang-style, single-address-space scheduler into the kernel. Then you can have a microkernel and a million native processes without the huge overhead of naive implementations. There are surely many huge practical hurdles to overcome with that, and maybe some that can&#x27;t be overcome at all, but it sure sounds right when written in two paragraphs. ;)",1397784151

That&#x27;s not very efficient. (It might be interesting to note that at the ethernet level, IP addresses also provide MAC address discovery. If you are serious about latency, floating IP ownership is generally far faster than other solutions.)<p>Configuration: We already have many configuration management systems, with many problems[1]. This is just a key/value store, and as such is not as immediately portable to arbitrary services as existing approaches such as &quot;bunch-of-files&quot;, instead requiring overhead for each service launched in order to make it function with to this configuration model.<p>The use of the newer raft consensus algorithm is interesting, but consensus does not a high availability cluster make. You also need elements like formal inter-service dependency definition in order to have any hope of automatically managing cluster state transitions required to recover from failures in non-trivial topologies. Corosync/Pacemaker has this, Consul doesn&#x27;t. Then there&#x27;s the potential split-brain issues resulting from non-redundant communications paths... raft doesn&#x27;t tackle this, as it&#x27;s an algorithm only. Simply put: given five nodes, one of which fails normally, if the remaining four split in equal halves who is the legitimate ruler? Game of thrones.<p>As <i>peterwwillis</i> pointed out, for web-oriented cases, the same degree of architectural flexibility and failure detection proposed under consul can be achieved with significantly reduced complexity using traditional means like a frontend proxy.

It&#x27;s been a while since I thought about it.<p>>The type of accounting you&#x27;re describing is nearly impossible for these extreme tech projects.<p>I thought I had made myself clearer. Obviously the company&#x27;s losses are what did it in, so of course it matters regardless of how ambitious the company is. Investors can provide entrepreneurs with more time to discover a sustainable business model. Governments do not have a great track record for producing profitable enterprises that sustain themselves, to say the least.<p>The position that I subscribe to is that those sorts of stimulus methods make it harder for companies to discover a business model rather than easier, because it pushes the incentive towards politicking rather than building a successful private company.<p>It was not my intention to impugn the original investors or even the people who work there.

7607480,comment,7604809,7605439,8,0,omarhegazy,,,"How is Dropbox&#x27;s core business unsustainable?<p>The way I see it, Dropbox wants to be the filesystem and personal hard drive of the Internet. Easy enough business, just sell hard drive space. And as always with any software business, with users, you have data, and with data, you have potential advertiser money and a lot of investor interest.<p>Why can&#x27;t they rival Google/Apple?  Yes, bigger companies have a lot more resources. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that only big companies can succeed. If small companies have nailed a service that big companies can&#x27;t wrap their heads around/move quick enough to take over, then they&#x27;ll outperform big companies in that market. Once upon a time, Apple was a small company, too. But they did personal computer and personal computer software better than competitors long enough to become a large company. Not too long ago, Google was a small company too, competing with large companies. The reason they succeeded to go on to become a big company is their superior product. Yahoo and other search engine competitors just couldn&#x27;t tap into what Google had, whether it be because they didn&#x27;t possess the genius/talent/skill/anything-other-than-resources Google employees had that made their product better, or because Yahoo was too large to move strategies fast enough to beat Google to market. Even more recent than Google being a small company, Dropbox was just another Y Combinator application that was shat on by oblivious HNers who thought &quot;Don&#x27;t people just use rsync and ftp?&quot;. But because they could provide a product that people wanted before big companies could catch on in time, they grew in size. Small companies have a chance against big companies. If they didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;d be a pretty fascist society where everyone&#x27;d be forced to use the same products and services for all of forever.<p>How is this &quot;flailing&quot;? Google integrates cloud editing (Docs) with cloud storage (Drive) pretty well and that great integration is what&#x27;s allowing Google to enroach on Dropbox&#x27;s vision of being &quot;the file system and hard drive of the Internet.&quot; Google has just shown us that integrating content creation tools with content storage tools isn&#x27;t &quot;flailing&quot; or feature creep or anything; it&#x27;s a valid strategy to boost content storage. And Dropbox is catching the hints. That&#x27;s why this acquisition exists. So they can integrate content creation (HackSpace) with content storage (Dropbox). Now claiming HackSpace is going to put up a good fight against Google Docs is pretty absurd, but 1. now they&#x27;re being backed by Dropbox, which should aid in the fight, and 2. remember what I said about small companies having a good chance if their product is good enough? With proper leadership (Drew Houston and Condoleezza Rice [moral issues aside, she has business and leadership skills that are completely separate from her political views which wouldn&#x27;t affect anything about her position at Dropbox]  -- check), resources (Dropbox -- check), and product design and development (this is the risk Dropbox is taking by purchasing HackSpace -- will DB be able to produce a better product than Docs?), yes HackSpace <i>can</i> beat Docs.<p>&quot;Acquisitions like this never go to plan, and they are almost always a waste of money.&quot;<p>Why does HN do this? Toss around bold and interesting rhetoric that is completely baseless and has no substance or logic. Like the Michael Bay of writing.<p>This is so absurd, I don&#x27;t even feel like I need to argue against it; it&#x27;s like saying &quot;The idea of companies never go to plan and are almost always a waste of money.&quot; It&#x27;s just so ridiculous and against the way the real world works that it&#x27;s more on you to prove your radical theories than it&#x27;s on me to prove them wrong.<p>If acquisitions didn&#x27;t work to produce a net benefit, then successful companies wouldn&#x27;t do them, period.",1397783277

For example, I think most windows devs know much more about CP than SO, but you&#x27;re not going to find them here, as they&#x27;re not well represented.<p>And I think that issue is more generally applied to the communities that hang around most of the startup world/young internet... Most people are more interested in getting started on rails than learning ASP.NET/VB -- and of course, many of the exciting new technologies are not tied into the windows ecosystem, so there isn&#x27;t much need to get yourself into the windows ecosystem...<p>I would venture to say that CP needs to do something drastic, rebrand itself (possibly offer a less-cluttered site), and start trying to reach other programming languages/areas more heavily? Not quite sure how you&#x27;d do the latter, though<p>Also, with the stats they have at the top, seems like they certainly have the userbase...<p>Maybe they could even open up an R&D department, do some advertising to get new hires in it, and start to try and do more experiments? Like for example, if someone were to post on HN tomorrow that CP had a beta site, trying a super interesting new fluid search box, clean redesign, and possibly some drastic interface change, even if it was just a beta, I&#x27;d be really interested, and it would definitely get people to view and remember the site...<p>Again, the R&D team would serve well to get people excited about this.

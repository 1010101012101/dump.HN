If it's cleverly hidden, or inserted only for certain IPs, chances are low that anybody would notice. Then the host would have your encrypted text <i>and</i> passphrase.<p>It would be better to have a desktop application, with source code the user can verify. Then no matter what the host changes on their end, I can know that only the encrypted text is being sent. Even better, host-based applications can tie into existing frameworks like GNOME Keyring and GnuPG, for even better security than can be provided by a 128-byte passphrase.",1269871939

1226528,comment,1226176,1226503,0,0,barrkel,,,"I don't think that's clearer. Factoring quadratic equations is taught in schools, and that's where you learn how to multiply out expressions of this form:<p><pre><code>    (ax + b)(cx + d) = ax(cx + d) + b(cx + d)\n                     = acx^2 + adx + bcx + bd\n</code></pre>\nA special case of these factorizations is:<p><pre><code>    (ax + c)(ax - c) = ax(ax - c) + c(ax - c)\n                     = a^2x^2 - acx + acx - c^2\n                     = a^2x^2 - c^2\n</code></pre>\nThe reason it's a special case is because there's cancellation of the terms. So starting out with this is useful, as it's likely to be something people have met in school - but people needn't remember the factorization (which isn't strictly speaking needed much - we have an equation for solving this), just how to multiply the terms (which is used more often). From it, we can derive all that's needed for the trick, without any odd moves.<p>With your own version, you have to introduce a term which adds up to zero - (r^2 - r^2) - for no obvious reason, and then you need to already know how to factor x^2 - r^2 to (x + r)(x - r) in order to understand the last step.<p>So I think your version is less easy to understand because it's not clear why the first step is what it is, and it relies on more recollection of school arithmetic.<p>(The only reason I expound at length on this is because I think what makes something obvious or easy to understand is a deep topic, linked to what's assumed to be known beforehand and the size of inferential jumps between steps, and is important for programming, writing, and indeed all communication.)",1269871420

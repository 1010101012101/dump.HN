The system produces guidelines such as &quot;after looking at tens of studies, for patients above X years old, procedure X doesn&#x27;t make sense&quot;; it&#x27;s way more important for doctors to be able to assess symptoms and to have a feeling for how to tweak those guidelines (yes, this guy is over 60, but he ran a marathon last week without problems, has never smoked, and his parents, both in their nineties, do not need care yet) than to know the ins and outs of statistics.<p>After all, all those statistics are kind of meaningless. They rarely are split by sex, age, smoking behaviour, and familial history (&quot;Where was the study of nonsmoking 36-year-old neurosurgeons?&quot;) It&#x27;s a doctor&#x27;s job to, somehow, find the best approach using incomplete data.<p>More importantly, all guidelines likely are about approaches that have changed since the data was collected.

That&#x27;s not the case, it seems that the only foreign force concerned with Ukrainian nationalists are Putin&#x27;s medias.<p>Ukrainian nationalists are often overrated: their traditional message and goal is &quot;Glory to Ukraine&quot;, anti-Moscow feeling is also strong (not surprisingly), and alas, some historical &quot;domestic&quot; antisemitism which almost never comes into real actions and sometimes is actively fought (Maidan now actively protects Jews from any assaults, our government has tried to speculate on this, Berkut are also mildly antisemitic - it&#x27;s a common Slavic trait).

But I guess there are those who <i>would</i> say it with a straight face, so I&#x27;m glad we can have this discussion anyway.<p>> It would be preferable not to engage in aggressive warfare. But it&#x27;s also preferable not to be the one who ends up dead from it.<p>So far, since the end of the cold war, the US is waging war on much weaker enemies, not any who pose an actual threat to its existence. And I think even conquering any and all potential threats will inevitably mean turning onto its own citizens, too, I believe. I mean, even more so than that is already the case.<p>And China for example will rise either way, a military defense against aggression might be unrealistic; however, there is also culture, and being worth more as an ally than a conquered territory. More importantly, there is democracy; not yet in China, heck, not yet hardly anywhere, but in theory. And people in general don&#x27;t like war, it&#x27;s the elites that use them as cannonfodders and bill payers in them who do. Not being hateworthy seems less risky than trying to win all the time and constantly increasing the stakes. But sadly I think the US is very used to being aggressive, and assumes everybody else is, too, that only American power keeps them in check. I don&#x27;t think this is true.<p>> Americans are by no means the only militaristic nationalists around<p>Of course they&#x27;re not, but we&#x27;re talking about the US military on an american website. And the US, at least for the time being, is the top dog. The path the US takes is very important to me because of that, I do think it trickles down to everybody else to a degree, or at least makes it harder to achieve some progress and sanity in other countries.<p>> it&#x27;s worth pointing out that those two things are not mutually exclusive.<p>I disagree, though I guess it&#x27;s hard to know for sure, because how would we measure it? Still, I think when a nation wages war, the citizens get to shoulder <i>all</i> the costs (or debt, in the case of the US), but they don&#x27;t get a comparable share in the profits.  And I don&#x27;t think that share outweighs the costs to them, either.<p>> If you&#x27;re born into a nation, and into the systems which brought it into being, and you derive benefits from it - food, education, language, culture - then I believe you are to a degree a paricipant in or benefactor of the crimes which made those benefits possible. They were done on your behalf whether you like it or not.<p>Of course. But I also derive a lot of benefit of things people in general are doing. By &quot;not buying into nations&quot; I meant I don&#x27;t feel pride in &quot;my&quot; country, just like I don&#x27;t feel pride in what another right-hander, or male, or member of any other group I could be said to &quot;belong to&quot;, is doing. War does live off this spectator sports mentality, and I just don&#x27;t feel it. It has nothing to do with the internet, at least for me, though I hope it can help that process along. Nations are a way to organize things on a certain scale, but no more. They are not holy or special, they are arbitrary.<p>> I think you can put yourself beyond nationalism if you wish, and doing so is understandable in a post-Internet age. But I don&#x27;t believe that puts you above it. You are a product of the industries of slavery, barbarism, greed and genocide, as am I, as is every human being. Before nations, people slaughtered one another in the name of their tribe, or their clan, or their family, or gods. We are all of us standing atop a pile of bones simply by virtue of birth... it&#x27;s just that some piles are bigger than others.<p>Sure, but I think we have long since reached a point where the drawbacks of constant warfare and greed are bigger than the benefits of co-operation, though I can not really prove it. One thing is true for sure though, co-operation is <i>also</i> as old as history; if parents and children fought each other over food, we wouldn&#x27;t exist. We&#x27;re not <i>just</i> products of exploitation and slaughter, not by a long shot. And whatever put us here, now we are here: with an ability to think and make choices.<p>I actually don&#x27;t think humans always slaughtered each other whenever they could and derived some benefit from it. That is, scarcity makes us do that, and nowadays I feel this scarcity is also artificially created, even more so going forward. Greed also creates scarcity: if one is greedy enough, they will not ever be satisfied, even ruling the whole universe. That way lies at best despair, at worst disaster - so why not look for a better way to spend the time until the heat death? Yes, I&#x27;m an idealist. I believe in striving for something worthwhile more than adapting myself to what I found, and leaving it behind the way I found it.<p>I like to believe this is true:<p><i>[Humans] have been genetically programmed through hunting behavior: cooperation and sharing. Cooperation between members of the same band was a practical necessity for most hunting societies; so was the sharing of food. Since meat is perishable in most climates except that of the Arctic, it could not be preserved. Luck in hunting was not equally divided among all hunters; hence the practical outcome was that those who had luck today would share their food with those who would be lucky tomorrow. Assuming hunting behavior led to genetic changes, the conclusion would be that modern man has an innate impulse for cooperation and sharing, rather than for killing and cruelty.</i><p>Erich Fromm, &quot;The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness&quot;",1390732560

I remember introducing SUSE Linux at my high school in ~1998, and back then it could be installed by a reasonably technical person. Which was not that much different than Windows 9x, given all the work that was usually required to install device drivers, etc.<p>We also had some desktops with KDE and most students had no trouble doing their usual work (web browsing, text processing, e-mailing, etc.).<p>I wonder if things improved that much. Yes, we now have Android and iOS, which have a limited scope (portable devices). But, on the desktop and laptop it&#x27;s still Windows. Mac is only an option for the rich contingent of Western countries. Meanwhile, the Linux desktop has splintered into a market where there are no clear market leaders anymore - Red Hat abandoned the desktop, SUSE is not really visible anymore, and Canonical is working hard to get rid of its user community. That, plus a half a dozen desktops (GNOME, Unity, Mate, Cinnamon, KDE, Xfce). Frankly, it&#x27;s a mess! However, what&#x27;s perhaps more damaging is that &#x27;the hope&#x27; is gone. There was a time where many people believed that the Linux desktop would eventually take over. Now nobody believes that there will ever be the year of Linux on the desktop and a large number of developers has left to OS X.<p>The only spark of hope are web applications, since they are platform independent and there is usually some competition. However, you never purchase or own an actual license. So, the vendor could go bankrupt, cancel development, remove features that are crucial, etc. You can never make the decision to stick with an older version, since you don&#x27;t own a license. Moreover, usually you get a backup of your data in any easy way, let alone convert your data to a web app of a competitor.<p>tl;dr: mobile devices are not good computers yet, on general purpose machines one of the best competitors fragmented itself into oblivion, in platform-independent web apps you are dependent on the whims of the vendor and locked-in.<p>To end on a positive note: at least Android is mostly open and captured most of the smartphone market and will do the same on tablets. It&#x27;s really good to see the work of the Cyanogenmod community, etc.<p>Edit: Downvoters: Is it because you believe that the Linux desktop hasn&#x27;t fragmented?

Treat the page as it is - a collection of experiences.<p>I&#x27;ve bothered to type this out because you seem to be reasonable and to argue in good faith. To understand why people feel marginalised can take a bit more than logical argument though. You need to be open minded and to attempt to empathise with other people.",1390730696

These two games feature the most scripted A.I. in the history of video games. And yet, I love the A.I. of both games. They&#x27;re programmed to react differently to your different actions and while everything is pre-programmed and you&#x27;ll learn just how scripted it is by the time you&#x27;re about half-done with the game, there&#x27;re so many different scripts to the A.I., that as predictable as they are, you&#x27;ll en up having a lot of unique and unpredictable moments in those two games.&quot;<p>Compare that to &quot;Creatures&quot; for example.<p>Quoting from: <a href=""http://aigamedev.com/open/highlights/top-ai-games/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aigamedev.com/open/highlights/top-ai-games/</a><p>&quot;Creatures is an artificial life program where the user ‘hatches’ small furry animals and teaches them how to behave. These “Norms” can talk, feed themselves, and protect themselves against vicious creatures.<p>It’s the first popular application of machine learning into an interactive simulation.<p>Neural networks are used by the creatures to learn what to do. The game is regarded as a breakthrough in alife research, which aims to model the behavior of creatures interacting with their environment.&quot;<p>So I am sure that no matter at how good MGS 3 might get, given I am specifically putting attention to this aspect (and that I am not really interested in stunning graphics and such), at some point I will surely notice its scripted behaviour...<p>Thanks for the suggestion though, it might still be a good game to play. :)",1390730577

There is no second view within humam rights framework.<p>- Yanukovych&#x27;s power-sharing offer is a sham. It is not true power sharing until he is a president - he controls everything.<p>- Just looks at the definintion of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism</a>. Yes, there is a nationalistic element in Svoboda party. It isn&#x27;t pretty itself as well, but it is far, far, far from fascism. Nobody besides Yanukovych is authoritarian here.<p>- protesters were beaten up for 2 months, but didn&#x27;t fight back. Only when Yanukovych decided to forbid peaceful protest in general the aggression from protesters started. I don&#x27;t think police should be just standing under Molotov cocktails, but their reaction SHOULD NOT be shooting from a sniper riffles, killing 5 people, violently beating up protesters, kidnapping protesters from hospitals (!) beeting them up again (!) and taking them far into the fields and leaving there to die on -10°C (14°F) (!).<p>- Yanukovych has indeed been elected through democratical elections. That is true. And what has he done since then? Jailed his main opponent Yulia Tymoshenko. Changed the constitution to have full power in his hands. There is not a chance now that the next election under him will be fair. And you can state whatever you want but Party of Regions did loos a lot of electorate now. It is not half of coutry now at all, as you&#x27;ve stated.",1390730465

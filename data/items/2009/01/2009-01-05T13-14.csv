About a quarter of Americans lived in poverty, and about half of old people.<p>More people with more money to spend means a bigger market for whatever I'm selling. That's why Social Security is good. That's why markets are bigger in places with lots of Social Security-type programs (Europe, the U.S.) than in places without them (South America, Africa).<p>Social Security also helps make it possible for me to be an entrepreneur. I know that I can take risks and not plunge my family into abject poverty if I'm crippled and can't work.<p>Why did I write about Conservatism in relation to this article? Because when someone is attacking Social Security, it's almost always as part of a larger political agenda they're promoting: Conservatism.<p>This article was from the Hoover Institution, a politically Conservative organization that pushes to eliminate New Deal programs like Social Security (not just SS). They also push for unregulated markets, and flat or regressive taxes. So does the American Enterprise Institute. So does the Heritage Foundation.<p>These groups call themselves ""think tanks,"" which implies objective research. Unfortunately, they aren't averse to pushing false information or abandoning their principles to promote their interests.<p>For example, For example, the Heritage Foundation sharply criticized Malaysia's government for years.

420391,comment,420183,420337,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"No, that is entirely incorrect. The government borrowing from SS is no different than them borrowing from the Chinese, either way it has to be repaid. At least this way the interest is going to Americans. Government borrowing itself may be a problem, but it's an entirely separate one.<p>The kicker is the first sentence. Today's workers pay today's retirees. The payments are designed to ensure a consistent, inflation adjusted standard of living for retirees. If the ratio of retirees to workers stayed the same, the payments would. But when there fewer retirees per worker, workers pay less, and when there are more, they pay more. It's the system's fatal flaw.<p>The problem now is that baby boomers paid much lower Social Security taxes than us, but they still need to receive the same standard of living that we will. You can see the historical rates here:<p><a href=""http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/Content/PDF/ssrate_historical.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/Content/PDF/ssrate_h...</a><p>They paid a lower % with a much lower cap, even adjusted for inflation. They did so because the retiree to worker ratio was lower. If they paid the same percentage and cap that we do now, Social Security would be sitting on enough money to cover the shortfall in the future.<p>In 20 years, that ratio will be much higher than today, meaning the workers of 2018 would have to pay far higher taxes still for the system to fund itself. This would, of course, be unbearable (it's already close) so the government will have to seek other solutions, such as borrowing money or printing.",1231162616

Here are some observations (that may not mean much south of 10 boxes.)<p>a) AWS feature advantages (mostly instascale, in our case) fade with the high cost of every additional dedicated box.<p>b) It's nice to virtualize the map of services to boxen, but at some level of scale, each box has a single task and you want the ability to run it _flat out_.  If so, you have to decide if Xen overhead is worth labor somewhere else, and alternately, if Xen source compatibility holds you back from new kernel features.  (Pick your VM technology.)<p>c) We still wanted instascale with our own software distribution, so in something less than a week I hand-tooled a pxe-based provisioner that initialized from a live exemplar (gentoo, whee).  It took some work to find the right propeller heads at Softlayer, but eventually we understood each other and the bootp listeners got turned off for our subnets.  ""Insta"" became 2-hour hardware activation, which was ok for us.  You might consider puppet in the same way (except for Gentoo's long from-scratch build time.)<p>d) Virtually all provider admin is automated and this still works and makes sense at scale.  The SOAP API that backs it is not quite fully baked, but is very useful.  Paired with box-level IPMI pokes, you can replicate AWS control over hardware.<p>e) Whatever AWS provides, at scale you still have a custom setup at some level of abstraction, so putting in place exactly the right hardware saves labor.<p>f) Substantial discounts can be had.",1231161929

Economic downturns will come and go. If this downturn tends back toward a bull market during Obama's term(s) in office, Obama will look like a genius. Anyway, there can only be one first black president, but there can be lots of presidents who enter office during an economic downturn. I'm not so sure that the American cultural shift is as profound as the article says, either. My family didn't buy a house (after returning to the United States from a stay in Taiwan) during the last several years precisely because we could easily see our local housing market was in a bubble. Plenty of Americans never used their houses as piggy banks or lived on credit cards, and plenty never will.

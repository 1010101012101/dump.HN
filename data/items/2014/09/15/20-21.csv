It&#x27;s hard to write generic code that merges two channels into one.  It&#x27;s hard to write generic code that acts as a future.<p>But it&#x27;s easy to write type-specific code to perform those operations.  Most Go programs do not need to merge channels of many different types.  So people simply write the code they need when they need it.<p>This is not to say that there is no use for generics.  There is clearly a use for generics, and examples using channels are among the strongest use cases.  I&#x27;m just trying to answer your question about what Go developers actually do.",1410814695

Requiring, for instance, type annotations on function arguments because it&#x27;s sometimes helpful is such a weird decision. Let the programmer decide when an annotation is needed. This gets annoying when you get into functions with complex arguments. Especially for local functions where the signature could be messy, but the limited scope means annotations just clutter things.

Buck and kick all you want, there is no winning in that world once you fail to conform.<p>That, I think, is the point of this piece. In effect, it says: &quot;You have made me larger than life. Well, I&#x27;m not. I am who I am and I love what I do. If you have made me out to be something more, I can&#x27;t help that. I am just like the rest of you. No more and no less. If you want me to shape my life by what you think, you will be disappointed. I will shape my own life regardless of your expectations.&quot;<p>Who knows if this really is betrayal or hypocrisy? Usually the reality is much more complex than the caricatures make it out to be but no one really knows except those directly connected with the events.<p>As for me, I have no ideological axe to grind and can simply stand back and say, as many people likely feel, &quot;that is one helluva ride for one so young to make.&quot;",1410813426

Initially, we introduced ownership as a means of transferring data safely and efficiently between tasks, but over time we have realized that the same mechanism allows us to move all sorts of things out of the language and into libraries. The resulting design is not only simpler to learn, but it is also much “closer to the metal” than we ever thought possible before. All Rust language constructs have a very direct mapping to machine operations, and Rust has no required runtime or external dependencies.</i><p>Almost sounds like they borrowed this thinking from Exokernel design...

The objections you level against WebRTC DataChannels make it sound like the particular transports you mention are somehow blessed, that it&#x27;s not and won&#x27;t ever be bittorrent unless it&#x27;s TCP or UDP (and even if it was a hard/fast requirement, one could still benefit from WebTorrent via Firefox extensions and Chrome apps).<p>Who cares if you&#x27;re using mmap, epoll, or inotify? Are you intimate with the performance limitations of IndexedDB in all browsers? How versed are you on the performance hit taken by File API? When do these limits become problems?

The web might not be the best choice for using a gigabit ethernet connection (or maybe it actually does it fine in some conditions!): the act of finding these particular points to dive deep deep into as an excuse to ignore, shun, and spit upon the expansion of human technical capabilities is a close-minded injustice. It&#x27;s bigotry, simpleminded technical bigotry showing off your inability to open your mind to possibilities, unwilling to open your arms to new improved things becoming available to people who want them and will benefit from their use, it&#x27;s your own intransigence in the face of the ongoing adaption and mutation going on in the world.

I&#x27;m competent in HTML/CSS, basically competent with Rails (have built very rudimentary web apps), but working full time in online marketing.<p>If this is actually an intro to coding for lawyers, it&#x27;s an intro to programming for those with no technical background whatsoever. Which is really cool (not that those don&#x27;t exist, but specifically designing this for a career path full of liberal arts types, not just for those with no experience, is interesting).  I like that they start with regex and HTML/markdown, since, while they are not what anyone would call software development, they are a simple, quickly useful example of the basic concept of coding - expressing human instructions in a language designed to be understood by a machine. They also are some of the more quickly usable &quot;coding&quot; concepts, HTML & Markdown in the obvious cases, but regex familiarity makes Google Analytics much more powerful.<p>Looking forward to working through it and seeing what it&#x27;s like.

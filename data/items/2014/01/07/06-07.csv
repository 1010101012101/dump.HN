They enjoy few chapters but soon they come across something more interesting on internet and then buy that book too. Almost all non-fiction has some boring bits which you just have to struggle through to reach interesting parts. Its in this struggle stage I find myself most vulnerable to start reading another book and leaving the current one. Do this for years and you end up having lots of unread books. I thought this is what OP was referring to.",1389077989

But there&#x27;s nothing that stops a programming language a few levels above machine from requiring that every pointer be initialized with a reference.<p>> As you admit yourself, the proposed solutions don&#x27;t actually get rid of anything. At best they can force you to handle nil value by wrapping it in some wrapper.<p>The entire point is that a large majority of APIs don&#x27;t WANT to accept or handle NIL, but have to, because the default is to allow it. And in some languages, such as Java, the only way to extend the type system is with reference types, making it impossible to ever not have to handle NIL. By reversing this decision, it becomes possible to specify both allowance and disallowance of NIL-valued parameters. Why you would ever argue against such expression is beyond me.",1389077089

The culprit isn&#x27;t manual memory management either.<p>The issue is just that the complexity of the type grows exponentially as you compose more generic types together.  The string was templated on three things: the character type (usually char), the traits, and the allocator.  Fair enough, but now the map is templated on the key type, the value type, the comparator, and the alocator.  So that&#x27;s 4 x 3 x 3 = 36 different parts in the StringToStringMap.  Java has similar &quot;russian doll&quot; types where you have many different layers of generics within generics.  You need to read all of them to fully understand the behavior.<p>To be honest, overuse of generics is a code smell in both C++ and Java.  One of the early warning signs that your code might have this problem is if you feel the urge to template on bool.  I do think that generics may come to Go some day, but I think it will require a lot of thought, and it may not come in quite the same form as it did for Java and C++.

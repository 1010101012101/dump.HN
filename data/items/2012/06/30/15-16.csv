Quite a big difference.<p>And honestly, if the author is deliberately trying to make my life difficult just to trick me into donating I'm going to be annoyed, and since I deeply disagree with that type of model (donations should be earned, it's not a form of annoy-ware) I will, out of principle, be <i>very</i> hesitant of donating (I'd like to say that I'd never donate, but if the application was truly exceptional I'd probably donate anyway (but I'd attach a comment describing that I dislike it)).<p>I can put up with quite a bit of tinkering to get something to run, but not if it is because the author have deliberately kept the make-file to himself (as he implied in the comments) just to get people to donate. Huge difference.<p>I'd probably be more recipient towards a commercial application with a decent trial-version. I much rather pay for something than getting it for free from someone being rude about it.",1341071950

Actually it gets worse in biology than what the article describes. There are networks of ""friends"" established across the country which survive by sharing credit as much as possible.

Members of those cliques often have impressive publication records, but when you start drilling down to what their individual contribution was to each paper, you start believing that you are watching some circus unfold in front of you.

(The easy thing to use is S3; though you're still vulnerable to Amazon outages, my empirical observation over my last three years as an AWS devops guy is that S3 rarely goes down, even when EBS or EC2 is freaking out. But the paranoid person has backups outside Amazon as well.)<p>Then, in an emergency, boot another MySQL server in a different zone (or even region), recover the DB, and go.<p>There are lots of problems with this plan. One is that it is wicked slow at the best of times: Your downtime will be measured in minutes or hours. The second is that, when AWS is having an outage, it very often becomes difficult to impossible to do anything with its API, <i>especially</i> launching new machines. (My hypothesis is that this is often due to the surge of thousands of people just like you, all trying to launch new machines to handle the outage.) So, again, downtime could be hours. But hours is better than days or decades.<p>For actual HA you must run two MySQL servers at all times, one in each of two availability zones, one of which has a slightly older copy of the data. To make ""slightly older"" as short as possible, most folks master-master replicate the data between the servers. But you must not write to both DB servers at the same time, so one machine will still be ""in charge"" of writes at any given moment, and you'll have to have a scheme for swapping that ""in charge of writes"" status over to the other DB when the first one fails. (I'd suggest the ""human logs in with SSH and runs a script"" method to start, on the assumption that you don't need HA on the time scale of thirty seconds rather than thirty minutes.)<p>There are several other bits of plumbing involved with replication: Setting up something like Nagios to alert you when replication breaks, learning how to rebuild replication from scratch when one server dies, et cetera. You'll want to check out Percona Toolkit. Or, though I haven't used it yet, you should read up on Percona XtraDB Cluster, which I think does all of the above and comes with the option to buy support from Percona, which has smart folks:<p><a href=""http://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtradb-cluster/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtradb-cluster/</a><p>The next stage, if you've got money, really love setting up new tools, and laugh defiantly in the face of latency, is to try master-master replication across AWS regions using a product like Continuent Tungsten: <a href=""http://continuent.com/downloads/software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://continuent.com/downloads/software</a> .

I've gone through many of the available tutorials, such as Michael Hartl's excellent Ruby on Rails Tutorial at http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ (both editions, books, and screencasts). I can build and understand simple CRUD-type applications with associations with no problems.<p>Now, I want to ""scratch my own itch"" and build an application I can actually use in my work. Basically, it will need to be able to keep track of tasks and comments arranged as projects and project templates. I'm running into difficulty designing these models and associations because they are more complex. I'm sure I could find or buy an application to do this, but I'd really like to learn how to do it myself, instead.<p>Question: Are there techniques or resources (books, tutorials, articles) or forums where I can learn to design more complex models and associations? This doesn't seem like it's specific to Rails (to me). Should I be researching database techniques, models, associations, for example, to get ideas?",1341069420

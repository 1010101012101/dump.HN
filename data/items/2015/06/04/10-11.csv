9658415,comment,9652528,9654919,0,0,nocarrier,,,"Carlos, you are mistaken re: Haystack. I don&#x27;t think it was ever planned to be replaced, it&#x27;s always been in use as a hot blob storage engine since it was launched. There are three storage layers for blobs at Facebook: hot (Haystack @ 3.6x replication), warm (F4 @ 2.1x), cold (Cold Storage @ 1.4x). We have published papers describing each layer.<p>Haystack still handles the initial writes and the burst of heavy read traffic when an object is fresh. It has a higher space overhead of 3.6x because it&#x27;s optimized for throughput and latency versus cost savings. The Haystack tier&#x27;s size is now dwarfed by the size of the F4 and Cold Storage tiers, but it still handles almost all of the reads for user blobs on Facebook due to the age/demand exponential curve.<p>After a haystack volume is locked and has cooled down enough, it moves to F4 to bump its replication factor way down for cheaper, longer term online storage. And then Cold Storage is used for the older stuff that gets barely any reads but that you still want to store online for perpetuity.<p>That is why the team that works on media storage is called Everstore; they take storing people&#x27;s photos and videos seriously and view it as a promise to keep your memories available forever. It feels really good to see photos from 5+ years ago and have them still work, and someday there will be 30 year old photos and videos on Everstore as well.<p>Source: I built Haystack with a couple other people and founded the Everstore team. :-)",1433415331

9658398,comment,9655285,9655285,0,0,Pro_bity,,,"For the lazy - Conclusions:<p>A patent strategy can indeed affect a tech startup company’s growth. The data indicates that companies that have patents in earlier rounds (especially before obtaining funding, or in Rounds 1 and 2) are able to obtain more total funding. This occurs in all markets, but is especially so in Biotechnology/Agriculture, IT/Hardware and Medical devices, in which the largest patenting activity tends to happen in the beginning of the company’s life. This suggests that patenting early may be more important for start-ups than what some views in venture capital may predict.<p>Surprisingly, most start-ups that patented filed their first application before even receiving any reported funding. A possible explanation is that these companies were aware of the potential signaling value of the patents, and that they strategically filed their patents early, despite the relatively high burden of patenting costs for an early-stage venture.<p>Also surprisingly, companies located in California patented more than companies located elsewhere. The study supports the idea that California provides unique conditions for start-up growth, and points out to the patenting activity in the state, a factor that is not commonly discussed in the startup environment.<p>Companies that were venture-backed also filed more patents that those which did not receive venture capital in any stage. This is consistent with previous studies, and reaffirms a strong connection between patents and venture capital.<p>Moreover, the results indicated that the number of patents (and not merely the fact that the company had patents) was highly correlated with total funding. The effect of each additional patent for companies in the dataset was 530,000 USD more in funding per additional patent application that the company had.<p>Finally, the analysis also supported the idea that patents account for only for a fraction of start-up success. While the contribution of patents to startup funding seems to be positive, what is the importance of a patent in comparison to other factors? The results back the position that while patents have a positive effect on funding, their contribution to start-up growth is somewhat limited: one factor among many of those that influence investor’s decisions. Patents can only explain increased funding in a limited number of cases, around 10% to 15% of them.<p>So are we in a position to solve the “patent dilemma”? While the study alone may not solve the dilemma for all companies, it serves to shed an empirical light on it, which is uniquely useful to entrepreneurs, lawyers and the startup ecosystem. Patents may not be a fundamental requirement to receive funding or be acquired, but they prove to be an advantageous tool for early-stage signaling of startup’s value and potential.",1433414838

Everything everybody does in life boils down to this. From Hitler to Mother Teresa. From Osama bin Laden to the Dalai Lama. You want to do things that matter, to change the world? Why? How do you know they matter? Because those to whom they matter love you for it. You love yourself for it, others love you for it and by your own spiritual presumptions, your gods love you for it, or they will some day. And so, it is not the big things or the small things that matter. It is not saving the lives of millions or attending your kid&#x27;s play that matters. The only thing that matters is you finding love, however you find it. If there is no love feedback for you, it doesn&#x27;t matter. That&#x27;s why nobody is trying to save the starving children in the planets of the Andromeda galaxy, coz there&#x27;s no feedback for it.

Because thinkers in the enlightenment realised that trying to outright do away with it would be too painful a tear for their societies, so instead, they invented systems (parliament, representation of commoners) which worked within, and then subverted the existing power structure.

Now that they don&#x27;t bundle it along with the default installation (XQuartz instead, that you must fetch yourself), how can I run xclock after installing OSX?<p>In truth, the lack of cmd-tabbing support to X11 apps is irritating, as is the menus on the windows being in the wrong place. I can see why they didn&#x27;t fully support it though - X11 just doesn&#x27;t fit in with their Quartz system. If you turn on Quartz Debugging and do things like &quot;show tracking rectangles&quot; X11 windows are a complete unknown to Quartz.",1433412252

Presumably the cookie is saved, and you&#x27;ll never be able to see opt-out hosts properties even if you later go direct!<p>b) As a host, Airbnb are passing on the cost of Google Ads (and potentially making a pure profit on them) directly to you, if the booking comes from a Google Ad.<p>Not sure how this benefits guests or hosts - and just seems to be a profit making exercise.

903722,comment,903402,903664,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Same here, only the other way. After being an atheist my entire life, I got more interested in religion over the past few months. After listening to dozens of hours worth of podcasts, and reading a few books and academic journal articles, I've decided that there is such a thing as a ""primary religious experience."" Furthermore, it's pretty clear that while academia can verify that this experience exists, science can't really go much further than that, at least in its current state.<p>As to whether this experience is caused by contact with god, or the sacred, or whatever, I'd put myself in your same ""agnostic atheist"" camp. Only I'd say that I'll approach some future experiences on the assumption that God is there. (Not that I'm going to go out and become super religious or anything, but being able to suspend disbelief once and a while is the key to making things fun, whether it's watching Star Wars or reading about Mysticism or whatever.)<p>That's the real take away I think, that in the same way most people don't like math because they were ""mathematically abused"" as kids, most people don't like religion because they were religiously abused as kids. When actually learning about religion is kinda fun and intellectually interesting.",1256579827

I was not at all satisfied with the teaching done at my college, so I started to search for materials which will aid my learning (and in some subjects entirely do the part of the lecturers). I knew about MIT OpenCourseWare but knew that wouldn't help in the least bit for two reasons, one it is made to be taught at MIT so sometimes it may go above my head, second...umm...because it is made to be taught at MIT...so it would not match the curriculum taught at my college. So then after some research I found about NPTEL(nptel.iitm.ac.in) while searching for video lectures on YouTube(I feel ashamed that I didn't knew about what my countries Elite Universities are doing in the first place and knew about MIT, but more on that later). I looked at some videos and quickly realized the content absolutely,and I quote, ""god sent"". I have not seen much due to bandwidth issues (which will be solved next month with an unlimited connection), but it was enough of a stimulus for this question to come into my mind:-<p>""What exactly is the actual benefit of Open Courses like NPTEL and MIT open course ware?""<p>I ask anyone who has used such means for his personal education: When you think of being tutored by the High Priests of engineering in india the IIT professors but in an long distance way, what is the main advantage you get above people not using it.

If the job doesn't say anything about a specific skill, take it off your resume (unless its a general skill like UNIX) - include no more than 6-10 skills.  I definitely include skills and don't think it's tacky in our applicants, but it is tacky to include a huge list of acronyms and makes people think you actually know less (less about more, instead of more about less).  Cover letters are nice, but in my view they are just a paragraph to know how well the person speaks english (many hackers don't speak english well).  I like short, casual, cover letters ('hi, saw the post on craigslist, heres 4 bullets why im good for the job, hope to hear from you soon, DONE.)  Number one thing for me is to keep in concise, don't make the reader read through a giant paragraph description of your work, just bullet points and tailor the bullet points to the job (you're trying to say ""heres my experience at abc123 corp. and heres why its relevant to you"").<p>cover letter is exponentially more important if you aren't replying to a job posting, and less if you are (we use craigslist so get a ton of applicants and we weed people out based on bad english in the cover letter, but we dont really see many cover letters so good that they sway us positively)",1256578355

903602,comment,903280,903280,0,0,agotterer,,,"In the last week I have read way too many resumes. Here are some of the things that I would look to tell all future candidates...<p>- Your resume should be no more then 1, if you must 2 pages (1 page per 10 yrs experience). I can't tell you how many 5-7 page resumes I receive that get a quick skim and thrown aside.<p>- Use the cover letter to address the company. Who ever is reading it is probably reading others as well. The same generic boring BS gets old. Every letter says ""I would be a good fit for your company and my skills match your job description"". That is obvious or you wouldnt be applying, or you didnt read the job description. Tell the company what you can do for them and not what they can do for you. Mention why you want to work there and what intrigues you about the company. Pretend you read the job description and researched the company. Be personal-able. You are trying to stand out amongst potentially hundreds of other candidates.<p>- A skills section is useful, especially for tech jobs. But you don't need to mention every tool you have ever used. No one cares that you still know win 3.1 (I see that on resumes sometimes). Give the highlights and worthwhile list. More is not always better.<p>- Definitely include your publications, speaking events anything that shows your community activity. They dont need to be more then a line or short description.<p>- Some people put what tools and languages are used for every project. It starts getting repetitive. I think those can be covered in your skills list. The projects should be short and sweet with a few bullet points. Tell the reader what the project is and what you contributed. You don't need to list everything you ever did at a company. Just need to give the reader a taste of your skill level and ability to perform the job they are filling. If they like you, you will get an interview or follow up questions.<p>The goal is not to digest your entire life story and work history into a resume. Old jobs and projects can fall off the list. I know its hard to part with some of those things, but it will better your chances that someone will actually read your whole resume. You want to impress them as quickly as possible.

It's so amazingly ridiculous.

Nothing is driving innovation anymore in the PC market - the average computer today has little more capability than a computer from five years ago. Apple, however, is using the brute force of its market share to drive technology forward...Then, the rest of the industry follows suit in a vain attempt to catch them...</i><p>What compels people to turn their total ignorance of the hardware industry into love letters for Apple? Not only do Apple's economies of scale have nothing to do with the cost of e-IPS, Dell was the first out of the gate with an e-IPS display ( \n<a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/15/dells-2209wa-lcd-monitor-reviewed-deemed-king-of-22-inchers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/15/dells-2209wa-lcd-monitor-...</a> ) but of course these fanboys didn't notice.<p>So now, because they don't know there's a difference between s-IPS and e-IPS, it's Apple's business strategy that is changing the world, rather than the scientists and engineers at LG.

I've always been an ""algorithm"" person: find the underlying pattern that gives beauty and stability (the two being synonyms, of course!) to the apparently chaotic world around us. Increasingly though, I've come to find that discrete difference has its own beauty and instability (the two being synonyms, or so I keep telling myself) that I had been blocked from appreciating.<p>Less philosophically and more pragmatically: during a time of reflection I was thinking about how my demand for precision was limiting my social interaction.

But I can never change if I'm right, of course!<p>So I began to talk with people I knew were smart but didn't have the same penchant for demanding precision. On their testimony, I came to believe that there must be something good in ambiguity, though I couldn't comprehend what.  I began to practice 'not objecting' when someone would use language or ideas ambiguously. This was immensely frustrating, but I vowed to let it be and try and find the value. Enough times of getting a glimmer of insight led me to finally admit that there was something worthwhile in ambiguity, and so I changed my mind.",1256576622

</code></pre>
Not quite,  some fairly popular home routers have issues where they don't have enough ram and crash rather than loose NAT data.  Which really isn't a problem until you run a (stupidly) high connection protocol like bit torrent.<p>So yeah it works if they reboot their router and restart the download but that isn't what you want to do in a youtube like app.",1243769423

The phones in their workshops rang frequently and new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?<p>The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch, it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements. Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together sub-assemblies of about ten components each, and each sub-assembly could be put down without falling apart. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly, and ten of the larger sub-assemblies constituted the whole watch",1243768745

Unlike some of the other short stories referenced here, the stories are all true and frequently amazing.<p>If you aren't, their podcast has a selection of stories recorded from their live performances. I subscribe to their podcast so if I ever feel the need to be entertained while bored, I can listen to one of their superb storytellers.<p>""The novelist George Dawes Green did that himself when he founded the Moth in 1997.

No one wants government to fail.<p>The argument is: What is the purpose of government and there are multiple views and perspectives on that.  The question, is then how do we work together when we disagree on the purpose and final goals.<p>In general the best way to do that is through a federalist process, where thing that all agree to bubble up to provide uniformity, where people feel strongly and are in disagreement allow them to self-segregate and then agree in their local area.<p>The problem with the government example is that by definition you are pointing a gun at someones head to make them do what you want; whereas competitor's are competing for mindshare of voluntary actors.",1243768140

A few (there are more!) reasons to let them go:\n- There's an opportunity cost. If you can only manage or you only want to have 1 ""startup point of contact for this platform"" you should have the best person in the job.\n- Bad people attract bad people (through both recruiting and the interviewing they do). I know nothing about Don other than his post-MSFT Google posts, but he presents himself in public like a tool. Do you really want to fill your shed with people like that?\n- Poor performers demoralize the rest of the team. Even if an individual is net profitable - relative to cost of capital! - if they're allowed to coast, they will have a negative impact on the performance of the rest of the team.<p>And let's be a little thoughtful here about where he went. VicG made the ""swift hire,"" but is the guy who was in charge of developer platform evangelism during the Longhorn/Vista and then Windows Live timeframe. Given their track records, do you think MSFT made the wrong decision in their termination or that Google/VicG made a poor decision hiring someone whom they likely didn't even send through a full interview loop? How do you think Don's <i>new</i> team feels about the way he was hired?",1258901882

955749,comment,955628,955717,0,0,NikkiA,,,"There is, though, also the 'crap filter' at work. That is, that yes, you can measure and prove that a 'vintage '59 les paul' will sound better than a new off the shelf '59 recreation. It has nothing to do with the production techniques being better (or worse) in '59 though.<p>Basically, both time periods ('year X' and 'now') had a reasonable amount of 'crap' and a reasonable amount of 'excellent instruments'. When you take a 'now' instrument off the shelf, you're taking a gamble as to which it will be, whereas as a 'year X' instrument has had a large amount of the 'crap' removed from the pool (destroyed, treated less fairly, etc) whereas the 'excellent' instruments have been treated better and preserved because they're 'excellent' instruments.<p>50 years from now, they'll be saying that 2009 instruments were made better, and people will be paying a huge amount for genuine '09 vintage instruments. This phenomenon is actually easy to see - in the 70s fender had a reputation that post-CBS (ie 'now') instruments were junk, and 50s vintage instruments were worth spending a fortune for. Here in 2009 though, there is the same '70s fender instruments are pretty damned good' approach that there was then to 50s instruments, people will pay silly money for a genuine 60s or 70s jazzmaster, tornado, mustang or even teles or strats - though obviously the 50s vintags for those are still preferred generally over the 60s and 70s. Again, the 'crap' that was considered common then, has been filtered out of the available pool, leaving a 'vintage = well made' mindset.",1258899547

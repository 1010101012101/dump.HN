There are some core issues with the language which, of course, cannot be just fixed, and no new features will make them go away. But there is also a beautiful simplicity and power in the way this (used to be) funny little language does classes, objects, scoping... I feel like these new features are bloating it, and for what? So that you can write an assignment in 1 instead of 3 lines? Wow. It&#x27;s as if, whatever programming language is trendy, JavaScript must absorb as much of its features as it can...<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, destructuring is a nifty feature, but it&#x27;s not really necessary. Plus, things like that usually get thought through along with everything else, when the language is designed. Not only is this increasing the conceptual weight of the language (OK, maybe I exaggerate in this example ;) but there are many more features added all the time), but now you also have a new set of potential pitfalls when doing potentially type-inappropriate destructuring. (I see from the text that you sometimes get undefined, and sometimes a TypeError?) Does JS need more of that?<p>Why not keep it simple? It may have its flaws, but the JavaScript mental model, once you figure out some corner cases, is really simple and powerful. I find it sometimes very elegant. This feature bloat reduces that, IMO, and could hurt understandability of JS code.",1432885641

This has nothing to do with debt.  And yes it is an advantage for the central bank / government to be able to do this - this advantage is called seigniorage.<p>Usually the central bank creates money to increase financial liquidity in the banking system, and as such it wants the newly created currency to enter the financial system.  The most common way to do that is for the CB to buy something - usually a bond, but it could be anything.  The person selling just gets the market value for their product - no special advantage in selling to a central bank vs anyone else.  But the total amount of fiat money in the system goes up.  In this way the creation of money is often seen to be linked with debt but is not a fundamental link.<p>Then there is a second, entirely seperate kind of money that is not fiat money which is called bank money.  Bank money is entirely based on debt - it is the debt of fiat money.  And bank money is the most common sort of money we use, much more common than fiat money e.g. I typically buy larger purchases with bank money (a bank card transferring the IOU of my bank to a shop) instead of with fiat money (notes and coins).<p>I agree this stuff is entirely not too obvious & the misconception that all money is based on debt is incredibly common.",1432883270

9623161,comment,9622001,9622001,0,0,Animats,,,"The original plan for IP was that if you created a new datagram-level protocol, you&#x27;d get a new IP protocol number for it.  There were a lot of those in the early days.[1]  Some were just encapsulation of other protocols - Xerox Parc Universal Protocol (IP protocol #12), Ethernet over IP (#97).  Others were for network routing and administration - Exterior Gateway Protocol (#8) and Dynamic Source Routing Protocol (#48). Those were all standardized numbers, and IANA still maintains that list, although most of those protocols are long dead.<p>UDP was a general encapsulation for doing the same thing one level higher.   Instead of IP level protocol numbers, the whole thing was repeated one level higher, and there are standard UDP port numbers.[2]  At the network level, there&#x27;s no big gain here, and it adds another header and some overhead. But BSD and the socket interface made a big distinction between software based on existing protocols and ones using the &quot;raw socket&quot; interface. That pushed new work to UDP and away from the IP protocol level.<p>If you want to have fun with your network, crank up something that speaks ISO-TP4 (protocol #29) such as Windows 2000 and see how far the packets get.  Or look at your corporate network&#x27;s packet traffic and see if there&#x27;s any activity on the old protocol numbers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-nu...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/s...</a>",1432883247

262675,comment,262625,262625,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Here's one I only found out about recently.<p>Multiple assignment in Python is already well known.<p><pre><code>  x, y = 10, 50\n</code></pre>\nBut this also works when the left or right variable lists are sequences.<p><pre><code>  [x,y] = 10,4\n\n  t = (1,2,3)\n\n  a,b,c = t\n</code></pre>\nIf you have a loop or a comprehension, and the values are sequences, you can access them like so<p><pre><code>  for (left, right) in zip(leftArray,rightArray):\n      ...\n</code></pre>\nYou can also do variable assignment inside an argument list. To see what I mean, suppose you're writing a 2d geometry library, and you use tuples as points. Ordinarily you might write<p><pre><code>  def func(point):\n      x, y = point[0], point[1]\n      ...\n</code></pre>\nor even<p><pre><code>  def func(point):\n      x, y = point\n      ...\n</code></pre>\nInstead, you can just write<p><pre><code>  def func((x,y)):\n      ...\n</code></pre>\nThis has many advantages. It gets around the problem of having to navigate to some other place to find out what composite data structures <i>are</i>. Points are just (x,y) tuples. It makes it easier to write sensible names, in many cases, which is crucial in a dynamic language. It's shorter. You spend less time packing, unpacking, and generally, schlepping your data, and more time <i>actually doing things.</i><p>Unfortunately, it's not the most generic of methods. It fixes you to a particular data representation. This is effective in certain cases, but is otherwise a problem when you need to change things. In practice, though, this can be avoided, and other code would break during such changes too.",1217479079

262651,comment,262018,262130,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>So I consider Perl to not be a best choice for occasional use: I always had to re-learn the syntax and decipher my old code - something I didn't have problem with in other languages.</i><p><i>To sum it up, Perl is a great language, but requires a lot of dedication like C++ does. So the eternal question still remains - Perl, Ruby or Python? ;-)</i><p>Perl is a deep language.  No one will argue that's not true.  But it is entirely possible to write Perl code in a very Pythonic style, if that's what floats your boat.  Perl objects are actually a lot like Python objects.  But, if you do that, you're stuck using only the features that Python would give you...which most experienced Perl mongers are unwilling to do.  (I'm aware there are a few interesting Python features that Perl lacks, or if not lacks, at least require a slightly more verbose implementation in Perl.)<p>I learned dynamic language programming with Perl about 10 years ago, and worked in it for a few years.  Then I worked in Python predominantly for a while...with some of the best Python developers in the world (if you use Python, you use code daily that a couple of them wrote), and found it a great language.  In fact, during those three or four years I decided that Python was a better language than Perl.  But, a funny thing happened, I found myself working full-time with Perl again about three years ago...and I decided that I should learn it properly this time rather than banging my way through based on what I could glean from examples of questionable heritage on the web.<p>It turns out, I was wrong.  Perl is a better language (for me) than Python.  They're both very fine languages, of course, but there are some things about Perl that really make me happy.  Unicode in Perl is so natural it's like magic, for example.  Not so in Python, where you have to ask explicitly for Unicode strings--you can actually write Perl code in Unicode, if you're feeling freaky like that.  Regexes are first class entities in Perl...a regex can be an object, can be made into a reference, etc. which is incredibly powerful once you're accustomed to it.  Backward compatibility is astoundingly good in Perl.  We have code that hasn't been touched in 10 years that <i>still runs</i> on Perl 5.10.  It may be ugly and old, but it works fine...the cheapest code to maintain is that which requires no maintenance.  When I worked in Python, I had to make changes to almost everything between several major revisions: 1.5 to 2.0, in particular, but the 2.x releases also <i>always</i> required minor code changes.<p>There are a few things I miss from Python, but the ""cleanliness"" of Python is not among them.  Modern Perl is extremely nice to read.  What I do miss is a good REPL (though mst's Devel::REPL is coming along nicely, it's still no iPython).<p>Ruby also seems pretty awesome.  I certainly found it very intuitive when I spent a week or so messing with it.  But many of the things I really loved came from Perl.  I do have to say that it always felt like I wrote fewer bugs into my code when working Ruby than Perl or Python (which always seemed about equal, to me).  I dunno why that is, exactly.",1217477627

Lisp gives you a general do loop and recursion and you define your own control structures based on that. Smalltalk is the same way...a loop is merely a message with a block sent to a receiver object.<p>Perl, C, Python, etc. have rigid syntax and control structures and keywords defined.

It interfaces well with its host (I can thread calls to host commands in Inferno-sh pipelines), and runs over top of Windows, Linux, and MacOSX.<p>One advantage of using Limbo to play around with systems programming in Inferno is that since it's a VM, you can muck it up as much as you like without affecting your host.  Also, with the clean, spare implementation, there's less cruft to learn to work with the OS (also the userland).<p>To start, there's a few blogs and Google code projects on programming in Inferno, as well as a book.<p><a href=""http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/inferno/getting-started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/inferno/getting-started.html</a><p><a href=""http://doc.cat-v.org/inferno/books/inferno_programming_with_limbo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.cat-v.org/inferno/books/inferno_programming_with_...</a><p>Limbo is also a good way to learn some of the ideas in Go, which also has modules, strong types, IPC over typed channels, automatic garbage collection, and simple abstract data types.

There's way more than one way to get a startup off the ground, and if you have a solid foundation that provides viral growth, your launch day shouldn't make or break your product. (Of course, if you're on a tight dealine and need to make user numbers, then that's a different story).<p>To test the viability of this idea, and the size of the market, I would look at how many Show HN posts appear in a single day. I'm figuring that the type of people posting to Show HN would be in some segment of your target market.<p>You could also expand this ""survey of how people launch sites"" to other things, like AngelList (although I don't think they mention when a company is launching) or Reddit.<p>These folks doing Show HN and stuff are probably your most likely customers, methinks.<p>Secondly, in your survey of the market, take a look at LaunchRawk Ads. See if you can get in touch with the people at LaunchRock and get an idea of the size of their ad inventory... i.e. how many people are putting up ads on a LaunchRock signup page to advertise another startup.<p>What would be a nice pivot for this idea, in my opinion, is user-management-as-a-service. The platform idea would be reversed; instead of startups entering information, users would sign up then get login and beta access to all these cool startups who are using the user-management-as-a-service.<p>Then you solve both the problem of getting startups users and the problem of publicizing the launch.",1366905473

5607920,comment,5605767,5606044,1,0,themckman,,,"I recently just had great success using coroutines to build a sort of function pipeline that can work in both code and at the command line with minimal effort; I'm doing a lot of text processing. A contrived example that prints the numbers in range(0, 100) ends up looking something like this:<p><pre><code>  @producer\n  def prod():\n    for i in range(0,100):\n      yield i\n\n  @producer\n  @consumer\n  def middleman():\n    for i in (yield):\n      yield i\n\n  @consumer\n  def cons():\n    for i in (yield):\n      print i\n</code></pre>\nProducers can yield values and consumers can use yield to get their input. I will fully admit that code, abstracted away by those decorators, is not the prettiest and took a minute to understand when writing. The biggest gotcha was with both a producer and consumer. You have to be very careful to capture the return value of the generator.send(input) call as it ends up being the item of the first yield. Also, pure consumers will immediately throw a StopIteration exception after sending the input. I'm very glad, however, that I stumbled upon using generators in this way as it results in a very clean implementation at this level. The internals are a little dicey, however, which I think is what you're eluding to.<p>I use the functions in multiprocessing.Process objects as the target by first binding them to pipes and also without binding them to anything, in which case they use stdin/stdout.",1366905361

5607861,comment,5603177,5606148,3,0,pavelludiq,,,"Scheme emphasizes building your software out of a small set of primitives. These primitives are themselves as conceptually simple as possible. an example is the map function which works on lists. In cl, the map function takes a designator for a return type and can take an arbitrary sequence(list, array or string). so if I want to turn a string into a list of characters in CL it would be (map 'list #'identity ""hello"") and I would get (#\h #\e #\l #\l #\o). For the special case, there is mapcar, which is the equivalent of map.  There are also a bunch of other ""map"" like functions in CL. CL emphasizes a rich set of tools in this way.<p>Another example is the member function. member checks to see if an element is in a list. In CL member takes an element, a list as well as several keyword arguments that control how the searching is conducted. One such keyword argument is test which is used to compare the element to the items in the list, and another one is key, which is called on the items in the list before they are compared to the searched element. In scheme you don't have the key argument, which is already a drag, and instead of having a test argument, you have 3 functions: member, using equal?, memq which uses eq?, and memv, which uses eqv? for comparison. If you need anything more than that, in scheme you'll have to write your own such function. in CL, you just pass two functions to member to control how it works. In that way, CL is actually much more conceptually simpler than scheme, but we have to keep myths alive, don't we :)<p>Another example is the CL concept of a generalized boolean. In CL nil is false, and everything else is true, with T being the canonical true value. In scheme you have special values representing true and false, which again complicates code a bit, but is more conceptually simpler. I consider this to be a great design blunder on schemes part.<p>Another example is that CL is very much an OO language, much more than an FP one. You have classes, methods, inheritance, mutable slots, and all sort of messy and complicated things that come in handy every once in a while.<p>I can go on for ever, but I won't even get to clojure, which is I think much more interesting. Clojure emphasizes immutability and laziness. Neither CL nor Scheme force you to be use immutability, but clojure does everywhere it makes sense to do so. Laziness is something else clojure emphasizes. And although there are libraries for CL to make it very much a clojure like language, it isn't the default.",1366904782

Is it economic value? The only reliable way to determine economic value is scarcity. If something is abundantly available (like oxygen or sunlight) its value in this regard is exactly zero. Anybody can obtain it and nobody can prevent it from being obtained. So in that regard I don't buy the argument that the artist has created economic value.<p>They have, however, created intrinsic cultural value. But cultural value is a completely subjective metric. How do we determine this value? Perhaps by counting the number of people who ""appreciate"" the art by obtaining it, legally or otherwise. But that would suggest that popular art is always more valuable than unpopular art, which we all can probably agree is false.<p>Starving artists are caught in a catch-22 situation. Until they become popular, their music is essentially worthless. Pirates, by copying and distributing their music for them, are actually adding value to their art. Most starving artists have a hard time <i>giving</i> their music away, let alone selling it, and I've yet to see one budding artist get upset about their music going viral.

No sane person actually believes that normal people are going to stop and think about whether or not they are obeying copyright laws; that is just not how people generally behave.<p>The truth is, in the 21st century copyright is nothing more than a red flag law that exists solely to protect obsolete industries.",1366904479

Residential energy consumption thus accounts for 17.9% of TFC, versus 17.7% for industry.<p>The non-residential sector is denominated in IEA terminology as 'Commercial and Public Services'. This sector encompasses office buildings, hotels & restaurants, education & research, hospital & healthcare, sports facilities and public administrations.

5607667,comment,5606471,5606936,10,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"DNS is probably the wrong word. You want some new method of name resolution, not DNS.<p>The thing with DNS is that it actually works pretty well as a distributed system. There are a bunch of different people responsible for different TLDs. If the operator of one TLD is censoring you, you can use a different one.<p>There are really two primary concerns with DNS. The first is that even if you have a domain using a TLD whose operators are unwilling to censor it, local DNS resolvers can still try to block it. This is not that hard to fix; either use a DNS server in a different country or (if your network blocking non-local DNS) do your DNS queries over Tor or some other secure proxy. It's also one of the things that DNSSEC or DNSCurve are supposed to prevent, if anyone would ever get around to implementing either of them. So this is solvable but non-ideal because it requires all the individual end-users to do something.<p>The second problem is that ICANN doesn't allow just anyone to operate a TLD, which means that the TLD operators themselves become choke points. Then censorial entities who see a TLD operator refusing to censor can put pressure on them (or their home country's government) to try to force the censorship.<p>So what you want is really to replace ICANN and the TLD operators with something more distributed, but the question is, with what? If you want a memorable but globally unique name then you need some method for everyone in the world to agree who it is that name should refer to. Right now the method is ""if the name ends in .com, it refers to who Verisign says it does"" and so on for other TLDs. You have trusted entities who can authoritatively determine who controls the domain.<p>I think (someone correct me if I'm wrong) that namecoin is trying to fix this with something along the lines of bitcoin, where whoever uses a name first gets to keep it. The problem there is that you need a way to make sure when it becomes popular you don't end up with a land grab and all the reasonable names end up in the hands of scammers and squatters, and I'm also not sure how they're addressing transferability and abandonment.<p>Just thinking out loud here, but how about this: Create a version of ICANN that works like IETF. No relationship to ICANN other than to refuse to issue TLDs that have already been issued by ICANN (and hopefully vice versa). Then, if you want a TLD, you can go to this group of people (who are maybe people like EFF members or well-known security researchers or activists) and they come to a consensus about whether you should get the TLD. So if EFF asks for "".eff"" they get it. If ACLU asks for "".aclu"" they get it. If La Quadrature du Net asks for "".lqdn"" they get it. If Debian Foundation asks for "".debian"" they get it. FSF gets "".fsf"" on and on. But if some scammer asks for "".bank"" they can go pound sand. Maybe make them sub-domains, so you end up with "".eff.foo"" and they all end in "".foo"" (insert whatever you like) to reduce possible collisions with ICANN. The idea will be to have domains outside the control of ICANN or anyone in particular and issue several hundred to generally well-known and trustworthy entities who are likely to resist censorship efforts. Then those entities can issue ""wikileaks.aclu"" <i>and</i> ""wikileaks.eff"" to wikileaks etc., so censoring them requires censoring all the anti-censorship organizations.<p>Once the working group assigns a TLD, they no longer have any involvement. They don't operate any technical infrastructure. All they do is publish the name of the domain and the public key of the entity it's assigned to (which can be used to sign domains in the TLD), to serve as the authority for resolving namespace collisions. Once an assignment is made it's permanent and irrevocable. The assigned organization's public key gets published and browser and OS vendors start including it and using it to authenticate domains in the TLD, resolved using whatever distributed system you like (that part is basically a solved problem) to map names to addresses.",1366903122

The moment <i>""you can pirate the game""</i>, it will be pirated. Or you can put it this way - the moment someone puts a DRM stripped version to bittorrent - it becomes available for anyone who wants to pirate it. And it happens all the time. So, again, what other proof do you need, to admit that DRM doesn't affect piracy?<p><i>> It doesn't tell us whether the same number of people actually do or whether any casual copying is deterred</i><p>Forget about casual copying. The bulk of pirating happens through the networks like bittorent and the like. If you claim that DRM is needed to stop ""casual copying"" - it's very silly, since any ""pirate"" who is determined to copy something won't go to ask friends for casual copies. They'll go to torrent networks. So what good did DRM achieve?<p><i>> Something involving hard data on sales and piracy trends with and without DRM</i><p>You'll never get hard data, since it's not possible. You can only use heuristics, and they all point in the same direction - DRM does not hurt pirates in the least. It hurts legitimate users.<p><i>> Ubisoft did change their stance on the DRM after the PR disaster associated with the AC2 launch</i><p>Will, major DRM fiascos happen. SimCity fiasco demonstrated that. Sometimes it's enough to clear their brains, but often not. I meant that in most cases execs don't care at all. As CDPR said in the interview I linked above:<p><i>Fortunately and unfortunately at the same time, games are becoming huge business. And as with every growing business, there are a lot of people coming in who have no clue about games and could work in any other industry. They are not asking themselves the question What is the experience of a gamer? Or Is this proposition fair? But rather, they just look to see if the column in Excel adds up well or not, and if they can have a good explanation for their bosses. As funny as this might sound, DRM is the best explanation, the best I will cover my ass thing. I strongly believe that this is the main reason the industry has not abandoned it until today, and to be frank this annoys me a hell of a lot. You are asking, So why is it taking so long for them to listen? The answer is very simple: They do not listen, as most of them do not care. As long as the numbers in Excel will add up they will not change anything.</i><p>I agree with that 100%. Because if those execs would care about user experience, DRM wouldn't exist.<p>And what he said about using piracy/DRM as an excuse for incompetence - that was very well spotted. I.e. imagine someone makes a film, game etc. and gets poor sales. They can admit the product was really not so good, so people don't care to buy it, or these execs can point to others and say - <i>Look, so many sales were lost due to pirates! But with DRM - we did all we could to stop them, so it's not our fault...</i>. I.e. DRM can easily be used as a fake excuse to avoid being blamed for the poor quality of the stuff they produce.",1366903036

Traditionally they'd handed the keys over to a big publisher and hoped for the best -- a sucker bet if I'd ever seen one.

5607582,comment,5601956,5601956,1,0,heme,,,"Thanks for the post. I'm at the beginning stages of planning a large single-page web application. I'm very interested in a Google-backed framework, but I continue to have concerns when reviewing tutorials like these. I'm genuinely interested in hearing thoughts on the points below.<p>Here are some of my concerns...<p>1. Spaghetti Code. <i>""... AngularJS let you execute expressions directly within your HTML pages.""</i> Why do I want JavaScript code in my HTML at all? I normally like absolutely clean HTML templates for two main reasons: 1) They can be used & rendered anywhere 2) they are easier to maintain.<p>2. AngularJS Directives seem to mix control structures & Code inside HTML templates. This seems difficult to maintain...\n    <div data-ng-repeat=""user in users"">\n    ...\n    </div>\nJavaScript can do loops and most developers understand that. <i>data-ng-repeat</i> is only understood by AngularJS, which means this template will always need to be rendered by AnglularJS. Also, is the template forever tied to a ""users"" collection? What if I would like to reuse the template for ""clients""?<p><pre><code>    <div data-ng-repeat=""user in users"" data-ng-show""=user.gender == 'female'"">\n    ...\n    </div></code></pre>\nAgain, code is mixed in with the HTML template. We moved away from <i><a href=""#"" onclick""alert('What is up?');""></i> a long time ago <i>(I realize my example is an event, but I think it still holds true.)</i> . Also, what does this code do behind the scenes: add ""display:none"", add ""visibility:hidden"", or add a CSS class? Where do I change the behavior. It feels like this code belongs in a controller/view with the rest of my code.<p>3. It seems as though the debate of DOM based rendering vs string based rendering is still going on, but do I have a choice with AngularJS? Right now, I'm not a fan string based rendering on the front-end because it locks me into a specific rendering engine (e.g. Handlebars, Mustache, Underscore etc.). Also, if you have no {{tokens}} in your templates you can render them on the server and then later update them on the front-end <i>(I see the AngularJS devs say this is bad, but hybrid can be useful for security, SEO)</i> . There are a number of DOM based templating engines out there. One I like very much is transparency. They have a great FAQ on this topic:<p><a href=""https://github.com/leonidas/transparency/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/leonidas/transparency/wiki/Frequently-Ask...</a><p>4. <i>""Using proper separation of concerns, controllers should never contain anything related to the DOM.""</i> Why is this the case? When would you ever use your controller outside of controlling the DOM in a Template?  Is AngularJS's view that the Controller contains the event-handling function, but the View/Template does the binding?",1366902216

I understand the whole TOS violation thing, but when a big company can shut down a <i>successful</i> startup just because they don't like what they're doing, it doesn't jive with that whole capitalism thing.<p>Is there anything we can do about this, or is it just a product of building on someone else's platform? Obviously, this has happened throughout history, but on a much smaller scale. I can't recall something as prevalent and simply integral to most people's everyday lives as Twitter/Facebook/the App Store where this sort of heavy-handedness could happen.

In any case, we're talking about 'multi-signature transactions' [0]:<p><pre><code>    A multi-signature transaction is one where a certain number of Bitcoins are ""encumbered"" with more than one recipient address. The subsequent transaction that spends these coins will require each party involved (or some subset, depending on the script), to see the proposed transaction and sign it with their private key.

Self-documenting code is a good fit for a reasonably small and straight forward function. If you have a function called get_thingy() in the context of some sort of ""thingy container"" then you probably don't need to go out of your way to explain ""This method gets a thingy from the thingy container.""<p>This can even be expanded to more complex single-purpose functions that are not exposed directly to any external APIs. For instance, if you have a functioned called restart_thread() which first tries to stop a thread, then stats a new one then you might be safe.<p>However, as soon as you leave the realm of the obvious, comments are a must. Clearly in situations where you're trying something clever, like that Q_rsqrt function, missing comments will boggle all but the most specialized professionals.<p>Unfortunately people often forget about another important type of comments; those that explain what function this piece of code serves in the program. I've lost count of the number of ""Context""s or ""Interface""s or ""get_data""s I've seen when trying to read someone's code. In those situations a single line like ""This context links the rendering pipeline to the physics simulation"" would go a very long way.<p>Instead when I see this sort of code it will either not have any comments at all, or it will be a dissertation that all the theoretical uses of the piece of code (Omitting what it's actually used for in the current context).",1366902030

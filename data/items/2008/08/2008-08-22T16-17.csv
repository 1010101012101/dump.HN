283877,comment,283639,283639,0,0,tptacek,,,"What the hell, they're only karma points:<p>I lived with Python for 4 years before I lost an argument at my own company and had my project moved to Ruby. I've since moved in with Ruby and haven't looked back.<p>* Everything in Python feels like a symbol table hack. Private methods? We have those! Just exploit this bug in the class symbol table lookup code!<p>* First-class symbols. There may be little difference under the hood between a Ruby interned string and a Python string atom, but there's definitely a difference syntactically. This is a difference that is hard to articulate, but if you've written much C, it's like having every ""enum"" you could ever want predefined for you, and completely eliminates ""magic numbers"".<p>* Blocks and lambdas. I've read GvR's take on this. I know he thinks a named function is just as good --- maybe even better! --- than an anonymous function. I had nested named functions/functors in C++ and Java. Even Tcl ""uplevel"" is better than Python's castrated lambda.<p>* Method definitions in Ruby don't need to accept a ""self"" argument. Again: all of Python feels like a symbol table hack to me.<p>* Ruby has first-class Regexps. Python has an ""re"" library. You know what else has an ""re"" library? C.<p>* I haven't found an expression that is better written as a list comprehension than as a map/reduce/select expression.<p>There are painful things about Ruby:<p>* The FFI is immature. Outside of Common Lisp, Python ctypes may be the best FFI out there.<p>* I never got Python to crash on me (at least, not where it was Python's fault). I crash Ruby once a week.<p>* Ruby is palpably slower than everything. If performance matters to you and you don't know C, you may be better off in Python.<p>* The community is led by the nose by Rails developers, which can at times feel like a worst-of-all-worlds grab bag of methodology programmers, web designers, and dabblers.",1219424189

The problem they are addressing is the fact that digital storage, when done incorrectly, can be very fragile.  I know several people that have lost all of their pictures due to hard drive crashes or theft.  These people are now making physical copies of EVERYTHING and putting them in safes and safe deposit boxes.<p>The currently accepted solution is to copy everything up to ""the cloud"" where things are backed up and redundant.  While this is a good solution for a lot of people, it's not for everyone.   I get the feeling that there's a group of (mostly older) people out there that would want (and be be willing to pay for) a longer lasting, physical storage medium like this.  A long-lasting write-once medium like this might be a good compromise between digital (easy to store a lot, fragile) and analog (harder to store a lot, longer lasting).<p>The main issues with this type of medium, though, would be price and compatibility.",1219424173

(Don't get me started on why procs are just like lambdas only different).<p>The difference between a block and a lambda is most clearly seen by asking what the return keyword does in a block vs. what it does in a lambda.<p>So in Ruby you can write something like:<p><pre><code>    def which_answer_is_correct(*answers)
      answers.each_with_index do |answer, index|

If blocks were syntactic sugar for lambdas, this method would always return 'none of the above'.

I give the right incantations based on a fundamental understanding of both the computer and the problem at hand, and the code <i>does something</i>. The fact that a program has... a will and personality and actually performs an activity is still astonishing to me. I know I'm anthropomorphizing but the idea that I can write all these little workers which go out and change the world (even if just in small ways) is fantastic.",1219421107

It takes a real genius to be able to learn the little things about C++ in a week or two.<p>A language is not just the syntax of the language itself, it's also the code style, the convention, the best practise, the language specific stuff, the API of the libraries available, the best way of doing things with libraries.<p>If you use python to write simple number crunching console applications, then switch to ruby, that is an easy switch.<p>But if you're writing a Web application using Python and Django and you switch to writing DirectSound using C++, and you tell me you can do this in a week, then you are a genius.<p>The syntax of languages are trivial, but that's like saying you can discover the colors used in a painting. That's the easy part. The difficult part is knowing how it works. Let me list a few examples of technologies that I think differ strongly from each other that make it difficult to switch<p>- MFC with C++<p>- Django with Python<p>- DirectShow with C++<p>- VHDL<p>- ASM<p>- Javascript with JQuery<p>- CSS with HTML<p>- Helix Framework with C++<p>- Quicktime API with C++<p>- OpenGL with .NET<p>- LISP<p>Have you ever had to switch between things on that level? Or are you talking more of a python to ruby switch?",1219421072

It's much nicer for quickly reaching them in new shells.<p>Under the project I typically have one subdirectory (""svn"") to represent the checkout, so there's ""svn/trunk"", etc.  This allows me to easily add project-related scrap files that clearly aren't meant to be checked in.<p>As for organizing what is checked in, my approach is not typical. :)  For instance, I don't believe in separating headers and source files...I find it extremely inconvenient to have them in different places, so I dump them in one place.",1219421071

Bussard died the other day unfortunately. Lerner's technology, Focus Fusion, seemed a more likely candidate anyway, in his talk he briefly mentions how much closer he is than Bussard to achieving fusion.",1219420917

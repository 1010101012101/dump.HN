In the algorithm you are citing, the numbers never leave their binary representation; there is no counting of the units that make up the number. The step of multiplying by 2 is done by shifting the binary representation of the number, which is not the way that this supposed &quot;Ethiopian algorithm&quot; works. The long multiplication algorithm (in binary or not) has complexity O(log(NM)), where N and M are the numbers to be multiplied, while this algorithm has complexity O(NM), and also gets there in a roundabout way.<p>This algorithm is totally pointless if you&#x27;re not going to work with a positional notation for the number; I am sure it was never used in the way described, with stones. Anyone capable of understanding the problem in the first place - 34 goats, 7 pieces per goat - would count out the price - here is 7 for the first goat, 7 for the next, etc. - and tell the shaman to take a hike. This story amounts to calling Ethiopians idiots for taking an algorithm suited for positionally represented numbers - or at least numbers in some kind of a concise representation - and using it in a totally unnecessary way with numbers represented as groups of stones, and not understanding the pointlessness of all the drudgery.",1381024119

As long as you only use ptr references, no overhead for reference counting (or other forms of garbage collection) is generated.<p>Of course, in order to use untraced references, you also have to use manual memory management (though you can use the macro/metaprogramming system to reduce the pain somewhat).<p>For traced references, Nimrod uses deferred reference counting; i.e. reference counts are only updated when they are stored on the heap or in a global variable (similar to write barriers for generational/incremental garbage collectors). If a reference count reaches zero, the reference is stored in a zero count table. At intervals, a separate pass checks if any references in the zero count table are still referenced from the stack (and does cycle detection where needed).<p>Deferred reference counting avoids the biggest problem with naive reference counting, which is that just assigning a pointer to a local variable (to inspect the contents of an object, say), can trigger up to two reference count updates. Conversely, with deferred reference counting, a read-only traversal of a data structure will not perform any reference count changes at all. Similarly, purely temporary allocations will not require any reference count changes, either.",1381023504

It is possible to be successful, true its not easy, but im not sure what in life thats worthwhile is easy.  Guys who say, its impossible, you will lose.  Thats ignorance.  HFT definately has an edge, but its not as much in their propietary strategies as people think.  HFT firms can make on average a tenth of cent profit on every share traded, and be profitable.  Of course they trade large volume, and with their broker dealer relationships pay a very very low commission rate, a rate so low its unavailable to the average joe.  If they paid what you pay to make a trade, they would go broke.

Meaning showing or placing an order they have no intention of executing, but placing it to manipulate the current price and there are a few ways to do this.  Exchanges overall have cracked down, but not always to the extent they could.  Some trading operations have been caught and fined by the sec for this kind of activity.  And then of course their strategies mostly based on statistical methods which presumes the price movements are random and statistics can be used to predict them.  With the other advantages, high speed connections, extremely low fees, high volume..  They dont need a crystal ball in their strategy, but something just good enough to turn the 50 percent chance of success to say 50.1 percent.<p>Recommendations for you, learn by doing and get a low fee broker.  Not giving away your profits in commissions is absolutely essential.  Interactive Brokers is a common choice for the retail trader and pretty good choice overall.  With trading, its tough as you may have to go bankrupt a couple times to learn what works.  More than many people are willing to tolerate.",1381022883

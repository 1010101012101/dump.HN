That&#x27;s all this piece is about, places where there is very high demand and a limited supply are very very expensive.<p>I have my own 2 bedroom flat in a professional neighbourhood, no through road, so it&#x27;s pretty much a private community. Paying under 700 a month on a standard variable rate mortgage (I could push it even lower switching mortgage providers).<p>Looking out my living room window I see trees. In winter, I have views of Caterham valley. It&#x27;s quiet and peaceful. This morning just the rustle of leaves and my clock ticking away. I&#x27;m surrounded by green, rarely hear traffic, a rumble of a train every now and again down the East Grinstead line. It&#x27;s everything that London is not.<p>So it&#x27;s part of Croydon, zone 6. A choice of two train lines, decent access to London. The 40 minute commute each way is good for hacking away at a personal project, laying down foundations for next steps, bolstering/improving unit-test coverage.<p>Granted, front-door-to-front-door, it costs me 11 hours to do an 8 hour day, but the time outside of that is all mine, in an environment conducive to lots of thinking and reflection, and coding zones.<p>And earning less than colleagues doing the same role, I have a lot more disposable income as a single tech-guy working in London.<p>Snub Croydon if you want, but you also chose to justify market prices of North London rent. That&#x27;s why London has a series of commuter belts running parallel to the train lines. There&#x27;s a tradeoff of cost, time and quality of life to be made.<p>I quite like the southern parts of Croydon: South Croydon, Purley, Kenley, Warlingham, Caterham. Croydon has good parts and bad, both can change over time, as people living there slowly change. I&#x27;m in a once-family area that&#x27;s mostly professional couples now. On the commuter belt into London.",1382867922

You can then get arithematic, algebra, calculus, and on and on.<p>If people want to go off and define axioms for made-up worlds that do not necessarily correspond to reality and then go do math with them, that&#x27;s fine. In fact, I would encourage it.<p>But we should not be approaching _all of mathematics_ in that way, and that is my point.<p>Math has the same basis in perceptual concretes (i.e. &quot;real things&quot;) as physics, biology, chemistry, etc.",1382867850

Money in the bank only does you any good insofar as it allows you to handle unexpected emergencies, all other cash should be deployed towards your goals. Which in Starcraft would be to defeat your opponent with generating more cash as a subordinate objective, and in business would be to either make as much money as possible throughout the history of your company, or fulfill whichever goals your company has. Amazon does this by keeping low margins to discourage competition and reinvesting as much as possible.<p>The biggest difference between Starcraft economics and real-world economics is that Starcraft has no regular expenses or debt, so there is no way to go bankrupt. This removes a large risk element in reinvesting your money.",1382867545

6621420,comment,6619993,6619993,1,0,bengalister,,,"Linux becomes more and more usable for non-technical users and has done a lot usability-wise on desktops but let&#x27;s face it there&#x27;s still a long way to go.<p>If for instance you use Ubuntu (the most popular distro for desktop), it is still plagued by bugs(and even the Long Term Support version). Have a look also at the Linux Mint forums it seems better but many users complain about buggy Cinammon. Well all in all, the desktop environments suffer of more bugs than on Windows or Mac.<p>Here are the reasons that keep me switching for my home PC (Ubuntu is only installed on my spare PC that I use for testing) : 
- No decent Flash support. The hardware acceleration by the GPU has been disabled (no option to enable it) and when I watch videos on youtube CPU reaches 100%. There&#x27;s still Chrome which has its own Flash player and it improves significantly with a CPU consumption of around 50% but still far from I got on Windows 7 between 10 and 20%...
- Battery draining : again a hot topic and mostly related to bad integration with popular graphic cards and other hardware components (wifi cards) but most people complain of reduced usage on battery (50%) compared to Windows.
- For Java developers who use Eclipse, SWT looks ugly and performs badly on Ubuntu (not tried on other distros). Swing based IDE like IntellijIDEA or Netbeans are better but they don&#x27;t match their Windows counterpart.
- Ubuntu or even kernel upgrades that tend to break things like for me a webcam support.<p>I wish these problems were solved because as a developer I still prefer Unix based OS. It is very subjective but what has changed for me recently is that now I really find Ubuntu to be more visually appealing than Windows 8 (and same for Gnome 3.10). The login screen, the dash, software center are  really nice. Even the Nautilus file manager that I used to dislike now looks really nice (now it is named Files) The desktop experience is much more &quot;consistent&quot; than it used to be and Ubuntu with Unity/Gnome shell and Gnome have worked hard to make the desktop user friendly and sexy.",1382867398

It&#x27;s two codepoints, an o (0x006F) with a combining diaeresis (0x0308).
It&#x27;s several bytes, depending on encoding.<p>How about if you reverse it first, so that the diaeresis doesn&#x27;t have anything to combine with, and you have a bare letter &#x27;o&#x27;? What&#x27;s the length now? If you answered _one_ to the above, you&#x27;ve got a string whose length doubles when you reverse it. Is that what you want?<p>Too easy for you?<p>Let&#x27;s take the Thai consonant &quot;&quot;, which is a sort of a g, sort of k sound. One grapheme, one codepoint. Sorted.

Let&#x27;s say two, but then let&#x27;s point out that there is no logical difference there between that and a different vowel: &quot;&quot;. This is a little more complicated? What&#x27;s the length now? Is that one or two graphemes? It&#x27;s clear as day that that&#x27;s a single consonant + a single vowel, but how long is the string? How about: &quot;&quot;? That&#x27;s still a single consonant + a combining single vowel, only this time it&#x27;s a compound vowel. One consonant, one vowel, how many graphemes?

6621412,comment,6621094,6621094,25,0,ot,,,"This question gets asked a lot, in particular by math students, and I think that the answer that is usually given, which is the same as many answers in this page, is overly simplistic: we don&#x27;t care about ontological truth of our axioms (and, by the way, of the deduction scheme), we just define a set of axioms and define true as <i>provable</i>. This is the formalist view of mathematics, which was the dominant view at the beginning of the 20th century.<p>This reduces math to a meaningless mind game, as acknowledged by Hilbert himself, one of the major proponents of this view: &quot;Mathematics is a game played according to certain simple rules with meaningless marks on paper&quot;.<p>Unfortunately, this sweeps under the rug important questions, such as &quot;if I prove the correctness of a an algorithm, how does this increase my confidence that the algorithm will actually work?&quot;, or &quot;if I compute the hypotenuse of a triangle with Pythagoras theorem, then cut a piece of wood and measure it, will they match?&quot;<p>This is why ultimately there is some belief involved. From Wikipedia [1]: &quot;In practice, most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, <i>do not doubt</i> the consistency of ZFC, generally their preferred axiomatic system&quot; (emphasis mine).<p>To work with with a set of axioms, we must <i>believe</i> that that set is both logically consistent, and that in some way its interpretation is consistent with reality. The first question cannot be answered for the interesting sets of axioms, thanks to Godel, and the second is not even well-defined.<p>For this and many other reasons, philosophy of mathematics has mostly moved on from the logicist/formalist view [2], but as most philosophical problems, there probably will never be a conclusive answer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics#Partial_resolution_of_the_crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics#Part...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics</a>",1382867264

Then a few years go by, somebody discovers a rootkit in the installer for the 300mb version 4.2.1.12, and gets annoyed enough to once again implement the protocol in 22kb, name it &quot;scrunchyTorrent&quot; and release it.<p>It&#x27;s quite fascinating.",1382866520

6621390,comment,6617694,6617694,11,0,Scienz,,,"This article was written in 1984, 29 years ago. Some of the information used in it is a bit out of date.<p>1) It refers to the triune brain model that has been debunked already. See this Scientific American blog entry: <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/09/07/revenge-of-the-lizard-brain/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/09/07/re...</a> So most of the speculation regarding reptilian, limbic and neocortical intelligences isn&#x27;t really valid. Though this doesn&#x27;t affect the chordate vs. ganglionic argument.<p>2) The article states that &quot;consciousness is an emergent of neuronal sentience&quot; which isn&#x27;t a necessary assumption. Recent research[1] has hinted at intelligent behavior as being a thermodynamic process occurring when a physical system acts such as to maximize its number of possible future states. Quick video summary: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZB8TNaG-ik"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZB8TNaG-ik</a> If true, a typical neuronal structure (i.e. brain) wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be required for intelligent or conscious behavior, maybe not even a typical computational structure. One could imagine a cloud of gas undergoing chemistry such that it maximized its entropy production and could potentially possess superhuman intelligence or consciousness.<p>3) The article discusses the theoretical limits of intelligence as being a system possessing 10^50 bits of information per kilogram. But the maximum limit of a computational system should be given by the Bekenstein bound[2], which limits the information the system can process to a factor proportional to the surface area of the enclosed volume (for a 1 cubic cm sphere this comes to about 10^66 bits), the speed of light limiting the speed at which these bits can be processed, and the particular structure of how they are processed (e.g. the flow of logic gates). One could imagine a (quantum?) computer with the maximum encloseable surface area of the universe which transmitted information optically between different gates in the system. There may be other limits preventing that from being remotely feasible (e.g. heat dissipation, energy requirements, entropy production leading to the heat death of the universe, etc.). The main point is that comparing the Apple II at +5 SQ on a scale of 0 to 50 is kind of silly, when one could imagine an intelligence the size of galaxies, or even the known universe, operating according to a principal of maximum entropy production similar as referenced in the previous paragraph.<p>Not to knock the article; my main point is that there have been a lot more theoretical advances in the almost-30-years since it was written.<p>[1] <a href=""http://math.mit.edu/~freer/papers/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.mit.edu/~freer/papers/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bekenstein_bound"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bekenstein_bound</a>",1382866473

Businesses that require a lot of capital to grow need to do that and might need to continue operating with lower or minimal profits as they grow.<p>However at some point it&#x27;s important to be able to say that they have played out the majority of their growth ambitions and are ready to start optimizing the business for greater profit.<p>The trouble is that human nature for many CEOs with big egos and the structure of corporations is to want to continue to grow forever. This is a dangerous attitude. For example perhaps Microsoft shareholders would have been much better off if the company was run without ANY ambitions to compete with Google, Apple OR to dominate mobile or tablets or search or any of these areas. Instead if Microsoft was to just focus on Windows and Office and extract as much profits from the business as possible, then return these profits to shareholders, then the shareholders would be free to invest in Apple and Google stock.<p>The trouble with this is that for an ambitious CEO this might feel like giving up. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s giving up. it&#x27;s called focus.

It acts as a web server that can be installed locally and configured directly to a SQL database (a legacy database or a new one, we&#x27;re currently supporting PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and MSSQL), so that makes it cross-platform. (ofcourse you can also build a proxy with node or nginx on the server&#x27;s port if that&#x27;s necessary)<p>2) Database queries are defined as URLs per HTTP request, using a query syntax very similar to SQL. This allows the user of an app to write necessary queries, hence extend the app on the client-side. Complex joins, filters and similar stuff is supported.<p>3) Zazler comes bundled with many technical formats, data visualizations and app templates. And they are extendable, meaning the app&#x27;s users themselves can decide how to view the data, even write their own formats and templates.<p>4) The feedback we&#x27;ve received from backend developers is that it will save them many, many hours of boilerplate coding. So it can also serve as a development platform that can be used to write database queries using URLs instead of writing boilerplate backend code. You can basically set it up and let the frontend technician take over the work from there.<p>5) We&#x27;ve used similar architecture for the last 6 years in our projects, so it&#x27;s pretty mature. Now we&#x27;re releasing Zazler as a beta for public and planning to launch it as a separate product in 2014.<p>I&#x27;ve written a blog post where I describe Zazler&#x27;s approach in more detail: &quot;API Creation  the Missing Link in API Management&quot; <a href=""http://www.zazler.com/?p=115"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zazler.com/?p=115</a>",1382866019

The problem with using Gopher space is that most if not all information that I consume, hacker news, social media, wikipedia is available in gopher format. Some have implemented gopher versions of reddit and hn in the past, but these are gone.<p>In a way google serp, e-mail, twitter already use this simplified UI - now if only we could unify it somehow.<p>One way of doing this would be by using console browsers to interface the web, or set your browser to use 1 font and style and no images. One of these browsers, Elinks 0.12pre6 has gopher as compile time option as added benefit.<p>Aonther problem with Gopher is that it doesn&#x27;t appear to support encryption and compression.

Each of these languages has an excellent repository for libraries -- these repos let me search for what I&#x27;m looking for, check out the matches, and decide what I should use; either through a web interface or the command-line tool of choice.<p>C is fun to learn, but I&#x27;m basically just searching for &quot;<functionality> C library&quot; in Google, and hoping for the best. Surely there is a better way?<p>I&#x27;m developing on Linux and Mac (I use homebrew). I  know that a lot of libraries can be pulled in through apt or similar, but they don&#x27;t seem to have the same breadth or focus that the other languages have.<p>What am I missing? Or is it merely a case of myself having the wrong mindset perhaps?",1382864437

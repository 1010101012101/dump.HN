It&#x27;s not officially released yet, but <a href=""https://github.com/timdorr/model-s-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/timdorr/model-s-api</a> shows the promise of Tesla&#x27;s commitment to openness. It won&#x27;t allow the &quot;how does my car work?&quot; type of tinkering, but it allows the &quot;how can I use my car in interesting ways?&quot; tinkering.<p>It&#x27;s much the same as computers. The original Apples were understandable devices. The lack of miniaturization meant that hackers could figure out how everything was working and play with it. That activity would be ridiculous with modern-day CPUs/components as the complexity has increased by orders of magnitude and the miniaturization has reached levels where specialized equipment is needed to look at what&#x27;s going on that costs well beyond what can fit in a hobbyist&#x27;s budget. Yet modern-day computers are still programmable and people are still learning and hacking. The only difference is that this learning is happening a few abstraction levels removed from the actual hardware. The same will be true with cars, provided manufacturers are as cooperative as Tesla seems to be.",1394837977

Hulu Plus theoretically works an awful lot like a DVR from your cable/satellite company (we&#x27;ll come back to the &quot;theoretically&quot; in a moment): watch new shows the day after they aired, as many as you want. <i>Plus</i> a lot of back catalog stuff, <i>plus</i> weird independent stuff that they bring in. Not for cable or satellite prices of $100+ a month (and that&#x27;s not counting &quot;premium&quot; channels like HBO), not even for the promotional special prices of ~$30 a month, but for $7.99 a month, and with about half as many ads, given that Hulu&#x27;s breaks are 60-90 seconds instead of 2-4 minutes.<p>I don&#x27;t know. On the surface, isn&#x27;t that kind of an amazing improvement?<p>Coming back to the &quot;theoretically,&quot; the problems I see with Hulu are certainly driven by stupid contractual obligations: they usually only have the last five episodes of any given series, so if you want to start watching something halfway through the season you&#x27;re out of luck; they sometimes don&#x27;t have rights to stream things on Hulu Plus that they do on <i>normal</i> Hulu, which is banana crazypants; and of course, there are shows and even whole networks they don&#x27;t carry.

7402512,comment,7398308,7398969,4,0,dice,,,">Mind you I don&#x27;t think I ever used &quot;Stop A&quot; on a Sun for anything constructive...<p>Back at the dot-com I worked at, we used to have a SPARCstation 5 that we used for SPARC-II arch builds. It was a nice machine, but it had a dead NVRAM battery so it would lose its configuration every time we lost power in the building (which was a lot, because rolling blackouts used to be a thing in California).<p>Anyway, an interesting quirk about the SPARCstation machines is that the MAC address for the NIC is stored in NVRAM, and when you lose the NVRAM settings it defaults to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff AKA the broadcast address. So by default, on boot, this machine would start sending out DHCP requests and other network traffic with a source address of the broadcast address. The switches we were using did <i>not</i> like that, and would start flooding all of their ports with traffic. The only way we found to fix it was to reboot the switches.<p>So, there is at least one constructive use for &quot;Stop A&quot;: you can use it to configure a MAC address on your SS5 so that it doesn&#x27;t inadvertently bring down the whole network in a massive broadcast storm.",1394837258

7402509,comment,7401055,7402196,3,0,zanny,,,"> Or do you have a better idea than copyright?<p>Capitalism. Pay for scarce goods and services on an open market. Since movies / music / etc are digital, and that is a number, and numbers are information, you don&#x27;t restrict information. Instead, you let the free market handle it - in the absence of copyright, people <i>still</i> want movies, and music, and new creative feats. And those creators want to live off of creating their works.<p>Hint: keyword is creating.<p>So as a creator you come before the masses and say &quot;I want to make X, but I need to eat to do so, and you want X, so let us have a mutually beneficial voluntary exchange and I&#x27;ll make it&quot;.<p>The only other thing you need is some kind of restitution system (I think) to artificially increase confidence in creators, or you end up with a reputation based insular ecosystem of the first few to meet the demand finding all the investment. It could be through investor like protection for failed projects, or it could be some program where the state provides you some stipend to attempt creative endeavors and they can deal with the arbitrage over failed works.<p>Regardless of how you go about it, the concept is the same - stop the doublethink. Information isn&#x27;t scarce. In the past, making it more scarce had value because it was still somewhat scarce. Today, information is no longer scarce. I have the means to transmit lifetimes worth of information in months / weeks / days / hours / minutes / seconds depending on your connection speeds. And I think there is something fundamentally different between the inception of copyright (make scarce information slightly more scarce to promote its creation because its creators have to endure the upfront costs of infrastructure to account for the medium scarcity of the end product) and modern information (which isn&#x27;t scarce, has no investment costs besides the scarce resources that go into creating an original instance of it, and has no deployment expenses).<p>This doesn&#x27;t happen today because the short term demand for information creation is satiated by media purchase, because funding new open media would be a long term purchase. So when people have to choose between new media now or new media later, they bend over for copyright. If their choice was free media now and paying for the media they want to see made later, there wouldn&#x27;t be a choice, and all that capital would (mostly<i>)flow to content creators.<p></i>: yes, it is likely in the absence of an artificial market propped up by copyright that, due to subliminal mental effects of marketing and appeal, and the fact hairless monkeys don&#x27;t make entirely rational purchasing decisions, some of those funds would be redirected towards other immediate scarce goods and services rather than potential future information creation. That only reflects how bad our current system is, though - it means people overspend on media because of the existence of copyright, not through rational process, but because they are manipulated into redistributing their funds through manipulation.<p>If you want an example of this system, look at the gooseberry movie project. Exactly how the future should be.<p><a href=""http://gooseberry.blender.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gooseberry.blender.org/</a>",1394837223

But as someone that wanted a better touch-optimised full-fat browser, I am very disappointed.<p>Metro is all about touch, and the problem with Firefox in that context is that its touch performance sucks-- zoom is irresponsive and stepped, and scrolling performance is sub-par too; IE on the other hand excels at both of these-- which is why I use IE-metro in touch scenarios despite having a strong preference for Firefox normally.<p>If Mozilla fixed these core issues (which I should note are &#x27;solved&#x27; on their android browser, and I believe are important anyway for their desktop mode), then I think they would have had a lot more interest in using Firefox in metro mode.. which is essentially what I have always wanted when using tablet-style, but have been waiting it out until they had something usable. I think their &#x27;marketing&#x27; has been really poor too.. I can&#x27;t say I really had any idea there <i>was</i> a metro mode to the existing Firefox.. why didn&#x27;t they try giving some kind of notification to windows8 users who had touch screens?

Dealers love those kinds of arrangements because it trains people to get their service at the dealer, so even after the warranty is over, they keep coming back for overpriced maintenance and repairs.<p>When a dealer sells you a &quot;lemon&quot; that racks up thousands of dollars in warranty-covered repairs it&#x27;s actually a bonanza for them.<p>The conflict of interest Musk is referring to is that dealers won&#x27;t want to sell extremely maintenance free cars because their revenue on the back-end would be miniscule.",1394835779

If it is unknowable, the market itself cannot act upon it either. The idea lurking here is of inarticulable knowledge or inexpressible information -- and it is a contradiction in terms.<p>Hayek&#x27;s big point -- in &#x27;The Use of Knowledge in Society&#x27; -- is really this: an economic system is a cooperative system, a cooperative system requires networking/sharing information, and money and markets are a way to convey and share information.<p>Hayek does not prove that centralisation is impossible, nor does he prove that money and markets are the only means to run an economy. An argument based on information is not going to get you there -- rather the opposite in fact.<p>Later in that article, Hayek says -- about gathering dispersed knowledge etc. -- (not) &quot;likely&quot; rather than &quot;never&quot;, and also says &quot;it is just conceptually possible&quot;. That is the sensible view: if the market is performing a computation, then any sufficiently powerful general computer could emulate it and any sufficiently good network could transmit the relevant information around. Indeed, with enough power you could process <i>more</i> information than the money-market system.<p>And that is actually where we are now. When there is a pocketable networked computer for every human on the planet, that rather blows away the idea that we need money to solve the &#x27;economic calculation&#x27; problem.

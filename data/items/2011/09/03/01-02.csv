For people to become producers they need incentive and opportunity.

Clojure was the first functional language I learned, and it was actually a ton of fun have to figure out basic things (like writing the fibonacci sequence) in a functional style. Also, Clojure introduced me to concepts I hadn't learned about with my bit of Java experience and moderate Python experience, such as lazy sequences, tail call recursion (and way more recursion in general), STM, and macros.

But I have worked at Google for a long time and basically everything you wrote is incorrect and has been since at least 2005 before App Engine even existed (why would a paper written in 1998 be relevant?).<p>Without going into too much detail, it shouldn't surprise anyone that physical machines are interchangeable via cluster management software, so application front end and back end software all end up running on the same machines.  They aren't addressed through DNS but by another mechanism.  There is no special system administration for application-specific front ends vs back ends.  Spinning up more instances of a particular server is a 1 line change.  Reverse proxies (i.e. a non-app-specific front end) are also involved but they're not a bottleneck AFAIK (this problem is well ""commoditized"" in open source whereas other parts of Google's stack are not).<p>I would be curious to see a comparison with competitors like Heroku, which I've heard are pretty expensive too.  Theoretically Google should be cheaper because Heroku runs on AWS and thus is paying for Amazon's profits (I have no idea how they compare.)",1315013347

Task queues (workers, SimpleWorker), many flavors of high availability data stores, memcache (or even better, Redis as a service), multitenancy, multiple versions of apps (git, releases).<p>Is there something bad about RDS that I don't know about?

2956196,comment,2955472,2955472,7,0,SwellJoe,,,"I was momentarily excited...until I read the description of the new Kindle.<p>I played with a Nook a few weeks ago, and <i>almost</i> bought one. $249 is nearly an impulse purchase price point. But, I already had a netbook, a Kindle, a laptop, a Nexus One (which broke a few days ago, to be replaced by a Sensation), a desktop, and a DS, so I talked myself out of it.<p>One of the big reasons is because I wouldn't be able to get rid of my existing Kindle. The Kindle has a killer feature, which I can't replicate: International 3G Internet for <i>free</i>. It's a piss poor excuse for a web browser, but when I'm out of the country, I can google ""wifi hotspot city-name"" and find a place to connect my netbook or laptop and get some work done. This is a miracle for someone that travels as much as I do.<p>The battery life is also spectacular. Since I travel in a motorhome, and sometimes go days without plugging in, the ability to read books without having to think about charging my ebook reader is awesome.<p>So, the two really awesome things about the current Kindle that I have, are not present in the Android Kindle. Also, the fact that they've forked Android hard makes me more than a little hesitant to consider it. My new phone is only a slight divergence from standard Android, and I find it annoying as hell...I'll probably be rooting it and putting a more standard Android on it when I have more free time. The notion of a total fork without a standard Market and all the Google apps (Maps is my lifeline when travelling), and possibly without some of the other apps I rely on, is just crazy. It's hard to imagine such a thing not sucking.<p>In short, it sounds like I'll be better served by a Nook, should I decide to buy a little ebook/tablet. At least it is readily converted to a standard Android device. Or, maybe I'll just wait out the next round of tablets...or, maybe I'll just not buy a tablet. I still have yet to figure out what I'd use one for. They seem to be highly focused consumption devices, and I do enough consumption as it is.",1315012801

If a VC has no real idea what the value of a company is, they have to make a conservative valuation, to avoid being conned. They will also take longer to do the due diligence. A good VC may be able to make a good guess whether a company is worth investing in just by speaking to the founders for a few hours. A less skilled VC might take weeks, and still have no idea, so they can only offer a lowball bid.",1315012390

After doing a Google search for ""Heroku for Python"", I found a quora Q&A[0] that lists a large number of python cloud hosts that function like heroku...but many are in Beta and require an email invite. Is it a common pattern for multiple startups offering similar services to be in beta at the same time and not try to beat each other to the punch of releasing first?<p>I appreciate the insight!<p>[0]: http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Heroku-equivalent-for-Django-applications",1315012239

My point is not to condemn atheism in general, but rather the militant variety that is not to content to judge people on their actions and deeds, but must attack their beliefs.  Attacking someone who has beliefs you do not share is certainly not unique to atheists (it&#x27;s fundamental human nature I suppose), but there is a certain hypocrisy about it that I find very distasteful.",1393840494

I wouldn&#x27;t consider this fraud, but for non-free theme parks, I do think a court might eventually have to make a decision based on what exactly you&#x27;re agreeing on when you pay for a ticket.

7332847,comment,7329540,7330857,4,0,lloeki,,,"> <i>Karpeles wrote his own SSH server in PHP.</i><p>I never heard of that one, although I know Mark Karpeles is the author of a few tools in PHP. I met him around 2003 when he developed, hosted and managed a Ragnarok Online (not so) private server (fRO) on Linux (hence his surname, MagicalTux). The whole time he paid the hosting himself. Contrary to more known servers such as eAthena, this server had a unique feature is that it was written in PHP and developed mostly by himself. The server was stable, allowed for quick iteration and took the load quite fine. The whole time he paid the hosting himself. He also wrote an inetd daemon in PHP. Another PHP game project that never took of was &#x27;Inochi&#x27;, but I can&#x27;t remember what it was about. He started a few other projects such as a homegrown OS and a VoIP system/company.<p>Still I can&#x27;t tell much about the quality of his code since I never read it, and all traces of his code have vanished, and that&#x27;s been more than 10 years ago. What I can remember though is that he was smart and friendly, but very sloppy at communicating.<p>For a side story, fRO grew sufficiently big that it caught attention of Gravity and Mark received a cease and desist letter, which he obeyed short of facing a trial. He rebuilt the server soon after though, authorising only a select few members (of which I was one) resulting in something more like a permanent, albeit remote, LAN party, and finally abandoned the project, stepping down and transitioning the management to the player community. The community stayed strong enough even without access to the server that Gravity offered an exit in a form of an officially sanctioned, monthly-paid server.

This is where the time allocated for the various beats is pushed around a bit by the performer to add character or emotional qualities. Very often, when the phrase &quot;..with feeling!&quot; is really speaking about <i>rubato</i> (or conversely, any &quot;mechanical&quot; quality a performance may have). &quot;Stop playing it like a robot; now stat again, <i>with feeling</i> this time!&quot;<p>So many people have a hard time picking out the meter, because they are still using an incorrect assumption: that time (meter/tempo/beats/etc) in music is <i>regular/consistent</i> - or even well-defined in the first place.<p>The important part to remember, when speaking of time-signatures, meter, and music theory in general, is that what&#x27;s written (or even what was intended by a composer) is only a guide. They&#x27;ve drawn a model on the page, that is intended to help express how you go about playing a song, but just as &quot;the map is not the territory&quot;, a quarter-note is not necessarily 1/4 of a measure in time[2].<p>This used to be more explicit in the Baroque era: you would see very simple notation on the page, and the performer was supposed to infer (and ad-lib their own) &quot;embellishments&quot; or &quot;ornaments&quot;[3] as they played.<p>This doesn&#x27;t apply to all music, and some songs would not work without their strict, mechanical interpretation of meter. Of particular note is &quot;martial music&quot;[4], which is often quite regular/low-rubato, and the Terminator theme has some march-like qualities such as its iconic sharp-beats. Martial music could be appropriate for Terminator&#x27;s subject matter, too. Instead, we get a really-modern[5] song that was likely performed directly, skipping the sheet music step entirely. That&#x27;s the thing about music; you can&#x27;t really shove it all in to nice, neat pidgen-holes, and if you could, some artist would just go and write a song that broke everything, for the lulz.<p>As the article mentions a Prophet-10, you also have to take into the considerations of the hardware involved, and how that influences everything, in large and/or subtle ways. If you&#x27;re interested in the topic of how hardware and creativity are intertwined, LFT (Linus Akesson) gave a very interesting talk on the subject: &quot;Poems for bugs&quot;[6].<p>[0] There are other acceptable interpretations, of course, but that makes no difference.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo_rubato"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo_rubato</a><p>[2] Also measures/bars don&#x27;t necessarily have the same time either, and the frequency of a note (on instruments that allow it) can vary as well.<p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornament_%28music%29#Western_classical_music"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornament_%28music%29#Western_cl...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_music"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_music</a><p>[5] &quot;Is it modern?&quot; ~Emperor Joseph II, in <i>Amadeus</i><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/poems-for-bugs/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/poems-for-bugs/index...</a>",1393837738

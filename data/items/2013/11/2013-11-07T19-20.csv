6691999,comment,6691077,6691077,1,0,aric,,,"> <i>Bitcoin is a fiduciary currency</i><p>> <i>Fiduciary currenciesin contrast with commodity-based currencies (such as gold coins or bank notes redeemable in gold)have no intrinsic value, and derive their value in exchange either from government fiat or from the belief that they may be accepted by someone else. They are inherently fragile; government orders can be ignored or doubted, and a currency that has value only because of the belief that it will have value may have no value at all (for instance, if I believe that no one will accept it, I will not accept it either).</i><p>--------------------------------<p>This article displays a lack of understanding of bitcoin, gold, and other market-driven assets. Quantifying bitcoin in terms of computing power and electricity is a clueless perspective. Conversely, the author doesn&#x27;t attempt to quantify gold by the same standards of its minimum measurable cost to produce and mere industrial scope. Gold, in his mind, I suspect, is long established and therefore above the same logic.<p>Bitcoin and gold are each greater than the sum of their cost to produce, obviously. Demand drives this. Stability drives this. Intrinsic value is contained in bitcoin and gold for varying reasons. If the author doesn&#x27;t appreciate (or understand) the intrinsic worth and applications of a peer-to-peer, cryptographically-secure, fungible transactional system that&#x27;s becoming increasingly hard to defeat by any central authority and increasingly used in the real world -- then so be it. Many people won&#x27;t value that. Hell, some people don&#x27;t value the internet. Not valuing something doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not valued. To me, gold is a pretty element and good for electronics. I don&#x27;t seek it out for fashion. Yet, I can fully appreciate why others do and why it&#x27;s a stable way to store value.<p>Bitcoin has intrinsic value. It is <i>not</i> a &quot;fiduciary currency.&quot; The &quot;currency&quot; of it is far removed from any guarantee of value and far separate from its functionality.",1383854365

6691988,comment,6690510,6691322,1,0,rbritton,,,"I personally prefer Spark Inspector over Reveal after having tried both. I find the interface much easier to read, though I do like the overall darker appearance of Reveal better. One feature that SI has over Reveal is the notification inspector, which I&#x27;ve found useful at times. Aside from that there&#x27;s no noticeable difference in the feature list that I&#x27;ve run into.<p>Reveal does do a better job of presenting views with pattern image background colors. In SI these are often not displayed at all.<p>Edit: It looks like one of the release note items in 1.1.1 is &quot;Views are now rendered more correctly in the Spark Inspector. Additional support for UIColor pattern images, CAShapeLayer, and more.&quot;<p>I personally do not find the 3D view in either one useful at all. It&#x27;s too noisy with something of any complexity to see the hierarchy, and particularly in SI&#x27;s case with limited background support it can be harder to see certain elements.<p>My two biggest wish list items for either one would be:<p>1. CALayer hierarchy inspection in the same manner as the UIView inspection works. I frequently use CALayer hierarchies when building custom controls rather than UIView ones because I find it easier.<p>2. Constraint visualization.

I was looking for some actual figures, but hadn&#x27;t found anything yet.<p>The best measure of fire &#x27;likelihood&#x27; is probably the incidence per vehicle mile driven, because it captures actual utilization.

The last piece of the puzzle is how many miles have the Model S cars driven?<p>The average annual miles driven for all vehicles is about 13,000 (<a href=""http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm</a>). Assuming driving habits are identical between Tesla owners and non-Tesla owners, we can get a rough upper limit of 195 million miles driven (the actual number is less because most model S owners have had their vehicle for less than one year). Back of the envelope calculations show that comes out to 65 million miles per fire (rough upper limit), without additional fires. Given the above data on all vehicles, similar reporting shows that the average vehicle goes about 11.1 million miles per fire.<p>Assumptions and research issues:<p>Vehicle fire data for 2003-2007 has not significantly changed<p>There are 15,000 Model S&#x27;s on the road (<a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/teslamotors-results-idUSL4N0BK65V20130220"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/teslamotors-result...</a>)<p>Tesla owners drive the national average of 13,000 miles per year in their Model S&#x27;s, and have had their cars for an average of one year.<p>If the fire issue is systemic, the rate of fires will go up, and that is not captured here.",1383853812

They don&#x27;t know/understand anything else and their identity and sense of self-worth is challenged if you speak ill of these technologies. That&#x27;s a big problem.<p>Pragmatically: I suppose that we embrace CSS/HTML/JS as object code. And I mean this in a much more dramatic way than CoffeeScript or SASS. This is finally starting to happen, thanks to browser support for things like source-maps. This is one reason I contribute to ClojureScript!<p>Idealistically: We should be pushing for lower level platforms for code distribution and execution, as well as host platform integration.

Remember, you get Java source code from the Frege compiler, and once you pack up your JAR with Proguard, say, nobody will be able to tell you didn&#x27;t write it in Java. (Well, slightly exaggerated, but you could have used some obscure library, who knows?)<p>So, if you have a small project, or some Haskell project without too many GHC extensions you want for some reason on the JVM, give it a try.",1383850860

There are approximately 19,000 Tesla Model S sedans on the road [2]. If we assume most of those vehicles are in the US, then the Tesla model S represents 0.007469% of the 254.4 million passenger vehicles in the US [3]. One would expect 1.8 Tesla Model S fires in a 2 month period if the chances of a fire are no different for the Model S than other vehicles. But, this calculation doesn&#x27;t take into account several other mitigating factors, for example if fires are more common in older cars than new cars.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nfpa.org/safety-information/for-consumers/vehicles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nfpa.org/safety-information/for-consumers/vehicle...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/05/tesla-q3-2013-earnings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/05/tesla-q3-2013-earnings/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_vehicles_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_vehicles_in_the_Unite...</a>",1383850825
6691588,comment,6691227,6691525,3,0,001sky,,,"no, you are missing the point. the battery is not defective. the battery system is just more likely to catch fire when compromised. petrol fuel systems are not only more protected from damage (typically, behind the second axle) but also just less likely to catch fire (on the hwy)[1]. You generally need both a puncture and a spark. A battery shorts with Just a puncture by something metal (usually), so there is one less logical step.<p>[1] High-pressure fuel lines are well protected outside of the battery, also (they are small) en route to the intake manifold. Here, the EFI rail is also behind the engine block and not likely to take a direct impact. Even then, they are flexible and not likly to break (they would bend).",1383850823

4634735,comment,4630057,4631483,2,0,BrendanEich,,,"Sorry, missed the Yoda misquote at the end, I must respond!<p>Yoda said ""where you <i>are</i>"" but you used ""was"". Possibly just a tense-typo, but it matters. Tracking where JS <i>is</i> is a part of the TC39 job, but only a part. It's easy to fall into a trap where we standardize only what developers can express given the language's current semantics and so miss the chance to extend those semantics.<p>But I'll take the tense-corrected bait: yes, I talk about the future. The past (including its most recent instantaneous sample known as ""the present"") is greedy. With no one to look ahead or synthesize ideas from compile-to-JS and other languages that win user support, JS will tend to stagnate, all else equal. Champions (not just me) must fight for a better future.<p>Stagnation on the web is a social ill. It costs developers tons of time. We know this not only from IE6, but from Android 2.x WebKit. Some not-disinterested parties might want to make use of a crisis of this sort, to force a ""new JS"" (Dart? remember WPF and WPF/E in the past) to be adopted for want of anything to relieve the stagnation.<p>Not me. The cost is too high, the lessons learned in JS will be half- or three-quarters-lost, and too much code and developer brainprint will be thrown away. I'm reminded of the XML Utopia that was planned in w3.org to save us from bad old HTML, before a few of us called b.s. and started the whatwg.org to do HTML5.<p>The web is an evolving system, JS is part of the web standards and must evolve too. Skate where the puck will be. Or to wannabe Yoda on ice: where the puck will be, you must skate!",1349834143

4634710,comment,4630057,4633027,3,0,dherman,,,"All abstractions can make your code unreadable; the key, as always, is to create good abstractions and document them clearly. Macros are syntactic abstractions. It's just as important to document them as it is for functions or objects. Of course, if you just have a little local macro that you're using for convenience, looking at the implementation may be sufficient. But when you write a macro that you want to share from a module, rather than requiring your clients to read the implementation, you document the syntax and the semantics, just like you would if you were writing a separate language.<p>But by having macros directly in JS, instead of having to use a whole language that compiles to JS, you can combine syntactic features from different sources. For example, right now there's no way to use one feature you like from CoffeeScript with another feature you like from TypeScript. You just can't combine them. But with macros, you could import two different syntaxes from two different libraries and use them in the same code.<p>On top of that, if we actually had macros in a future version of the standard, you wouldn't even have to precompile the macros offline, and you wouldn't need a preprocessing step at all. (For latency purposes, you might want to preprocess macros offline as an optimization. But for development, not having to do a preprocessing step is more convenient.)<p>Dave",1349833429

Once a table is partitioned and assuming new records are inserted over time, it's inevitable that some partitions will grow faster than others, and the advantage of partitioning is eroded by unequal-sized partitions.<p>So for a growing database this solution is really a stopgap measure, one that will eventually have to be repeated.<p>It seems to me that a hierarchical system has advantages over a huge single-level table of millions of records, for example one keyed by letters of the alphabet. But 100 million records in one flat table? Surely there's an organizing scheme that naturally produces faster access without resorting to artificially splitting up up the data.<p>To me, the fact that partitioning speeds up access means it's time to, not split up a gigantic table (something that may have to be done repeatedly), but rethink the database design.",1349832656

That's a hell of an achievement for anyone, let alone a teenager.  And let's not forget that the best known game in the App Store, Angry Birds, is just an artillery game, which date back to the 70's.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_game</a>",1349831021

The fact that two fans (not developers of the game) used their knowledge to have it play at a higher resolution with other adjustable effects and break the framerate cap.  The making it 'whole' speaks to PC gamers and what they expect out of games these days.  To have a PC game locked at 720p @ 30fps is unacceptable to most PC gamers.",1349830919

I'm not a game designer and I would only put myself in the hobbyist-gamer category, but I'm always so impressed by well-designed games.<p>I've played a ton of different games (board games, Magic, card games, RPGs, shooters, city-building, etc) and have even tried to create simple games in the past. What I found the most challenging and exciting was how to get all the different aspects of a game to come together. Top games today are probably made by specialists (I'm guessing) with someone who focuses on story or design or power balance or gameplay, etc. When I was a kid trying to put together all these things myself, I found it to be a really exciting and fun way to use my brain.<p>I guess I disagree that the reason kids (and kids at heart) should try building a game is to ""build a product, make money and make people all around the world just a little bit happier."" I think the reason they should build a game is to practice doing different types of critical thinking. But maybe it's hard to convince a kid to build a game with that kind of reason. :)",1349830904

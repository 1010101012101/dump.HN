I'm posting this here because I'm not sure where else to turn and there are a bunch of smart people here who may be able to help.<p>I'm in my late 20s and I feel stuck.  I had a lot of issues growing up and thankfully was able to work through most of them with the help of a very caring school counsellor.   I never went to college and spent a few years drifting between dead end jobs. I currently work in (tele) sales.<p>I taught myself to program as a teenager on an old Commodore Amiga.  Since then I've learned a number of different languages on a few different platforms. Over the years I've started countless projects - more than I can remember. The thing is - I never finish them.  I either spend weeks or months refactoring and rewriting the code or more commonly, I finish writing the code then give up when it comes to designing, documenting and polishing.  The same is true in other areas of my life.  DIY projects, travel plans, education, career changes... it all gets started, nothing gets finished.<p>I'm literally moved to tears when I think of all the wasted effort over the years - what might have been if I would have stuck with one thing or another.  I used to think reading HN would help.  Seeing people's MVPs - warts and all - that was supposed to teach me that shipping something was better than shipping nothing but its had the opposite affect. I beat myself up about why other people are able to see things through and I can't - to the point of paralysis some days where I'll waste days on end watching tv or playing games.<p>I've tried everything I can think of. Therapy, self help, hypnosis, a million productivity books, blogs, apps and techniques.  Anything google could tell me about I've looked into and most of it I've tried.  Nothing is helping.  I'm stuck and I can't see a way out. I feel like Bill Murray's character in Groundhog day.<p>Please HN, if anyone has been through anything like this or can suggest something I could try... please post.  I don't want life passing me by anymore. Help!",1313276135

2882195,comment,2881455,2882167,3,0,psykotic,,,"> You're right that if you can create a nice, modular API and have it be slow-as-heck if it's model doesn't correspond to the underlying hardware or processes.<p>Well, the underlying problem is that the design of an apparently abstract interface can commit you to a concrete choice of data representation and implementation strategy. If you expose and encourage use of random access in your string data type, you are committing yourself to a fixed byte-width representation unless you want to pile on implementation complexity of the sort I described while still only managing to solve the problem imperfectly. (As an aside, my favorite implementation trade-off for this problem might be Factor's approach where any given string internally has a fixed byte width of either 1 or 4 depending on whether it contains exclusively ASCII or some non-ASCII characters. It gives you some of the benefits of variable-width representations at virtually no additional implementation complexity.)<p>> But I would claim you are still in better shape than if you'd done spaghetti code.<p>Probably, but why the strawman?<p>>  You, yourself give the solution for your string example - in the yourself, if the actually needs random access in any performance-driven fashion, you'll need the extra-array so there's no problem.<p>But the size of the index array negates any space efficiency advantage a variable width representation might have had in the first place! It would only make sense if you needed to zero-copy pass a UTF-8 or UTF-16 buffer to a foreign API while still supporting constant-time random accesses into the buffer on your side.<p>> And given that you admit optimizations tend to be fragile constructs, it seems your argument strengths the argument, my argument, they should generally be done last.<p>Optimizations can definitely be fragile, but in my post I was referring specifically to automagic black box optimizations with my fragility claim. Put another way, performance guarantees should be an explicit part of your API design, along with error conditions and everything else. That's one thing STL got right. You have to lay the groundwork for future performance optimization possibilities with good API design. Those possibilities will be strictly limited if you don't think ahead. That might mean going with a bulk-oriented, data-driven API rather than a chatty, code-driven API, e.g. compare the way render state and shader constants work in Direct3D 10 versus its predecessors.<p>This is where experience and forward thinking is necessary. Crazy notion, I know.<p>Edit: Replied to the rest of your post.",1313275862

In an established code base that is reasonably well designed and well written, the performance is rarely dominated by a small number of very expensive bottlenecks that are ripe for local optimisation. Such things have usually been worked out a long time ago and there is no low hanging fruit left to pick.<p>At that point, if you've got five layers of architecture and each is only running at 75% efficiency because of all the little details, that might take your overall performance down to perhaps 25% of what it could be. If your software is I/O bound anyway or runs in half a second, you might not care. If that is the difference between taking a week to complete your research calculations and taking a month, or it represents a 5x increase in your hardware budget, then you probably care very much.",1313275380

Assuming your problem scales well on GPUs, many problems don&#x27;t. The GTX980 is actually a great performer. For Tesla class systems like the K40 it&#x27;s a lot closer to equal with the CPU on performance/$ (they&#x27;re not much faster than the GTX980 but a lot more expensive). But you can get an edge with the Teslas when you start comparing multi-GPU clusters to multi-CPU clusters, since with GPUs you need less of the super-expensive interconnect hardware. (You&#x27;re not going to put GTX cards in a cluster, you&#x27;d have massive reliability problems.)<p>IMHO, the guys showing 100x speedups on GPUs are Doing It Wrong; they use a poor implementation on the CPU, use just one CPU core, consider a very synthetic benchmark, or a bunch of other tricks.",1444773369

With regard to NNs, he seemed of the opinion that CNNs (the more obvious NN model) were too expensive and ultimately unnecessary compared to carefully chosen, physically motivated kernels. I have to admit I didn&#x27;t quite understand everything he presented, and I can&#x27;t seem to find a recent publication, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s one out there.<p>Despite enthusiastic presentations with lovely results, I suspect from the slow progress in this area that transferability is the main problem plaguing these methods. You want a local atomic potential which doesn&#x27;t depend on its environment beyond a certain radius, sort of like a convolutional kernel, but a lot of this sort of materials modelling/quantum chemistry is pretty inherently delocalised.

I&#x27;m not sure any mainstream language has a type that is equivalent to Haskell&#x27;s Foldable.<p>I&#x27;m guessing you have experience with languages that have generic types. The issue with the new Haskell prelude is that not only do you have to grok generic typing in order to write the most basic of Hello World introductory programs, you also have to be able to make sense of the Haddock docs.

10383726,comment,10378887,10378887,0,0,curryst,,,"> Microservices are a solution to a people problem, not a technical problem. They are a solution when in a large organization groups find it is easier to focus on a small problem space and communicate with other groups less - and also have a bit more room to choose their own path.<p>Microservices are a solution for more than that.  For one thing, it allows you to isolate components, which is rarely a bad thing.  If something is going to die, I would much rather lose a single component of the application than the entire application.  The component that suffered a failure may not be integral to some uses of the application (i.e. perhaps the email importing portion of a helpdesk app dies).<p>Beyond that, it helps with deployments to some degree.  I deal with this all the time, it&#x27;s much much easier to schedule and execute deployments if I only have to handle one group of people.  Each additional person/group just increases the number of requirements that surround the deployment, and more often than not, it ends up taking longer to actually get to the deployment due to the amount of communication that needs to happen.<p>> Do them when you have a problem, tighter coupling in your app stack and having less types of images means a much easier deployment, and probably more efficient code with less moving parts.<p>It also means that there&#x27;s a much greater surface area to investigate, although proper logging can help mitigate that.  It&#x27;s easier to find a bug in 2,000 lines of code than it is 10,000.  The separation of services can also be useful for debugging purposes.  If the issue impacts all of your services, it&#x27;s an issue with something shared, like the OS (if containers or config management) or a library shared between the services.  If you get a strange error with little indication of the issue on a more monolithic service, what does that tell you?  Not much.  The code may be more efficient, but the number of moving parts is dubious.  The number of moving parts total?  A monolithic application most likely will have fewer moving parts.  The number of moving parts per app, however, is almost certainly lower with microservices.<p>> An argument for things like containerization is often one of utilization. I’ll tell you here that this is a false one.  Why?  Autoscaling, or even manual scaling.  If you build an app stack that has a lot of small parts, yes, you don’t want to dedicate whole instances to those small parts.  However, as you incur load as your company grows, eventually these will scale out to want larger instances.  In the end, a somewhat more (but not totally) monolithic app will eventually consume a larger instance, and even more, as it scales out horizontally.  Eventually you are AT utilization for every component in your stack.<p>This is true of both architectures.  Yes, as your userbase grows the utilization of your app increases.  What this doesn&#x27;t mention is your guest density.  Docker uses LXC under the hood, and [LXC has much higher guest density than KVM](<a href=""https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/05/18/lxd-crushes-kvm-in-density-and-speed/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/05/18/lxd-crushes-kvm-in-de...</a>).  Most of the results I&#x27;ve seen indicate that it&#x27;s several times the density for low load guests, Canonical claims it&#x27;s about 15 times the density, though as the primary developers of it I&#x27;m skeptical of their results.<p>I can&#x27;t believe an article about how Docker is bad doesn&#x27;t even mention the difference in deployment.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always seen as the advantage of Docker, you don&#x27;t ship an app, you ship a fully functional and contained system.  You don&#x27;t have to deal with annoyances like diverging environments (i.e. somebody installed something in dev, but not prod, and some service has slightly different parameters in cert, etc, etc).  It also gives developers a lot more control over their own deployments.  The way my company does them, the developers send me a document explaining how to do the deployment, but they&#x27;re essentially flying in the dark.  Nearly all of them can&#x27;t log in to the prod servers, and the ones who can usually don&#x27;t have the permissions to read things like config files.  Not to mention that it vastly simplifies deployments.  Rather than having to know how to deploy 300 different applications, Docker (especially with the tooling) has a pretty uniform deployment regardless of what&#x27;s actually running on the server.",1444772984

The only reason it&#x27;s interesting to establish that they did is that it harms an alibi they weren&#x27;t forced to offer.<p>The Dutch report, and a lot of other open-source evidence, makes it pretty unlikely that the Ukranians launched the missile. This is a missile system that consists of several vehicles, one of which is a giant lumbering missile launcher. The missile was launched within an 100km^2 firmly controlled by the separatists. The Ukranian military didn&#x27;t spirit a missile launcher convoy to a wheat field just a few km south of Snizhne --- a town that Ukraine was <i>bombing</i> --- spectacularly down a jetliner, and then somehow spirit that convoy back to Ukranian-held territory. That is not a reasonable narrative.<p>I don&#x27;t see any serious arguments that this was anything other than a tragic accident. No matter who launched the missile, we&#x27;re all pretty sure they didn&#x27;t mean to shoot down MH17.

The industry should even more as she wasn&#x27;t a theoretical programmer like Ada Lovelace: she engineered actual software, co-invented many of the best practices for it, deployed them successfully in production, and then made a tool that automated much of that from requirement specs to correct code.<p>While programmers and industry ignore her, at least NASA gave her positive mention as the founder of software engineering and ultra-reliable software along with the biggest check they ever cut to an innovator:<p><a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2003/sep/HQ_03281_Hamilton_Honor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2003/sep/HQ_03281_Hamilton_...</a><p>Where would our systems and tools be if more attention was put into her methods, even just principles, than informal use of C? ;)",1444771048

Some folks of that generation did/do act in mostly-altruistic, benevolent ways, and some of them did/do not. The generational argument is a very clever red herring that shifts blame from a broken <i>system</i> to the previous generation -- print this comment out and put it somewhere safe; your future children will be blaming your generation, too.<p>> <i>&quot;how the hell did these people end up working minimum wage, 11pm shifts at the grocery store at age 58?&quot;</i><p>Lots of times, sheer boredom. Folks like us might do freelance coding or something in our old age, but there&#x27;s not a good market for freelance people managers (which a great deal of those 58-year-old bag boys probably were -- why not ask them next time?) Also, big grocery stores are typically union so it&#x27;s not actually a terrible career for the kind of work it is. Your generation has a different idea of what a &quot;good job&quot; is, so that&#x27;s probably informing a bit of your reaction too.<p>> <i>I find that many in the older generation are simply trying to make ends meet in an environment of scarcity</i><p>Most people are simply trying to make ends meet.

But it&#x27;s not anything new. This should tell you something important: the system is the problem, and the system is adverse to change.

There was a natural trend in the PC era to make computing devices available to everyone, which I think was a positive thing; this necessitated moving away from software that needed training or methodologies, for example. It also required software that many people would use, as opposed to more niche applications, in order to make the profit necessary to support a company. Unfortunately this has made it harder to create the more expert-oriented applications that could co-evolve with users via training and methodology that would be akin to calculus or music notation, or “bicycles of the mind” as Steve Jobs said;<p>The greatest productivity boost I have yet found, and the closest I&#x27;ve been able to come to a mind-machine interface is debian linux + tiling window manager + command line proficiency + customization of text files for creating shortcuts, tailoring work environment.<p>It has a learning curve, but the payoff is immense.

This article comes off as the frustrations of a developer who was forced to use Windows and didn&#x27;t like it (Boo hoo).  A lot of the &quot;issues&quot; he had left me scratching my head and a lot of the observations he&#x27;s made seem to be very anecdotal.<p>> As covered previously, Windows is not a good player when it comes to network-based server software.<p>What is the definition of &quot;network--based server software&quot;?  His &quot;as covered previously&quot; article doesn&#x27;t even contain the word network in it, so it&#x27;s really unclear what he&#x27;s complaining about to begin with.<p>> One other really big problem I see with Windows is that traditional Windows devs are typically only good at Windows and get lost very quickly outside of their comfort zones, which is not true for Linux devs.<p>That&#x27;s an anecdotal observation at best.  In my opinion most developers have comfort zones and get lost very quickly outside of them.  The difference between a good developer and a great developer is that the great developer doesn&#x27;t back down from a challenge outside their comfort zone and are willing to learn new things in-depth.<p>I know plenty of good developers who are only good in their language of choice and have no interest in moving outside of that tool-chain.  I&#x27;ve worked with plenty of PHP and Ruby developers who deployed to Linux and they didn&#x27;t know their ass from a hole in the wall regardless of their OS of choice.  I&#x27;ve also worked with a few Linux C/C++ developers on some projects and they had a very thin understanding of C#, often coding things from scratch that were built into the language.  Not to mention their love of nested loops.  I&#x27;ve also worked with some amazing OSX developers who had the same level of comfort on Linux that I do and were about as comfortable in Windows as I was on OSX (i.e. better than average).  But none of that matters because it&#x27;s all anecdotal.<p>> I had a Core i7 3770K 3.5GHZ desktop I built with 16 GB of RAM and a Vertex 4 512 GB SSD.

It literally has a Windows Experience Index of 5.9 and Windows + VS IS perfectly fine.<p>I&#x27;m really not sure what he&#x27;s done to his system, maybe he forgot to mention that he was running Windows 7 in a VM on Linux and everything down to the disk was virtualized and there was no hardware acceleration.  I see no other reason why his performance would be intolerable.<p>> Now I dev on a MacBook Pro which has less CPU horsepower than my beefy desktop and things are noticebly faster and the UX is infinitely better after a small learning curve.<p>Seriously?

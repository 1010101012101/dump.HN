7601038,comment,7596280,7598778,2,0,bmm6o,,,"I don&#x27;t buy the argument about GC being a hindrance.  If you have sensitive data (e.g. a key) that you don&#x27;t want sitting around in your process memory, you should wipe it as soon as you are done with it (e.g. zero out the byte array).  Just because there is a GC doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s the only way to clean up a resource.  String is immutable in both Java and C#, so if you are holding a password in an instance of one it can be difficult to overwrite the backing memory, but this is a separate argument from GC causing problems.  This is the problem that SecureString is meant to solve <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.securestring%28v=vs.110%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.secu...</a>.<p>Regarding GC performance, maybe there&#x27;s an avenue for attack there.  You could potentially infer the amount of garbage being generated by an implementation, which seems like it could be variable in a PK implementation.  I can&#x27;t really think of a way to generate variable amounts of garbage without doing variable amounts of computation, so I think you&#x27;re already leaking timing information.

7601016,comment,7599397,7600919,2,0,dperfect,,,"True. This may just be due to inaccuracies in the depth map. And therein lies the problem with synthetic aperture algorithms like this: to make it look (close to) natural, you need very clean depth boundaries. There will always be problems/artifacts when trying to calculate accurate boundaries from something as limited as a few seconds of 2D camera data.<p>EDIT: Hard to say if this really is a problem with the depth map. In the right image (foreground in focus), the background blur seems to end pretty close to the hair boundary, if not somewhat <i>inside</i> the boundary of hair - the edge of the hair appears slightly blurred. If the depth map were simply inaccurate (with the same inaccuracy applied in both images), I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;d see a portion of sharper background outside the hair boundary.

That&#x27;s a fairly big difference.<p>Idris handles laziness and strictness (or, relatedly, data/codata) a little differently than Agda, but it&#x27;s not a huge concern until you get technical.<p>Idris is also just younger than Agda and subsequently works a little wonkily.

These are the reasons we deploy many times a day. There&#x27;s no reason for us not to deploy things once they are tested and ready.<p>We&#x27;re not just deploying bug fixes quickly (which you seem to be fixating on a bit), we are constantly making small iterations. If we&#x27;re handling support and see something that could be improved, we improve it and roll it out quickly. If we have a moderate sized feature branch, it is merged, tested, and rolled out immediately as soon as it passes QA. No need to set a rigid &quot;We only deploy on Wednesdays&quot; schedule. Pass QA, deploy immediately.<p>> Not if it&#x27;s for a bug fix or security patch, but presumably most of your development work is adding new features? In that case, isn&#x27;t the whole point that it&#x27;s something the user will notice?<p>No, a huge chunk of dev time is spent iterating on and improving existing features. There gets to be a point in a product&#x27;s life cycle where you are more or less feature complete, where the emphasis shifts to refining and improving what you already have. Sure, there are new features, but if you never iterate, you&#x27;ve got older stuff accumulating dust and ageing badly.",1397687398

They were at the time a pair of college dropouts with about three years of school between them, and hippies to boot. [...] Now a startup operating out of a garage in Silicon Valley would feel part of an exalted tradition, like the poet in his garret, or the painter who can&#x27;t afford to heat his studio and thus has to wear a beret indoors. But in 1976 it didn&#x27;t seem so cool. The world hadn&#x27;t yet realized that starting a computer company was in the same category as being a writer or a painter. It hadn&#x27;t been for long. Only in the preceding couple years had the dramatic fall in the cost of hardware allowed outsiders to compete.</i><p>Clearly the people who make up the &quot;insiders&quot; and &quot;outsiders/marginal&quot; has changed and evolved over time - In the 70s and 80s Jobs & Woz were considered marginal, but eventually became the archetype of successful startup founders (the &quot;brilliant marketer&quot; and &quot;genius hacker&quot; tag team). More recently, Zuckerberg has also become a popular archetype as the &quot;technical-founder-and-CEO-in-one&quot;.<p>That being said, I wonder who the outsiders living and working on the margins are today, as it pertains to successful startup founders.

Many, many submissions to HN are based at bottom on press releases, and press releases are well known for spinning preliminary research findings beyond all recognition.

It&#x27;s not the solution to start blaming the programmer, but it&#x27;s a part of it. The other part is like you said, better accountability. It should be every bit as concerning that the compiler didn&#x27;t catch the dead code, that there was no code reviewer, that there was no static code analysis, that there was no test suite to ensure bad SSLs weren&#x27;t passing validation, etc.<p>> Time for the software industry to mature.<p>Exactly! The way I see it now, there&#x27;s no real accountability. We go, &quot;Oh well, it&#x27;s the fault of the language. It shouldn&#x27;t have let me screw up. If only we had a new language without unbraced-ifs ... and it somehow caught on and replaced all 40-years of legacy C code. Whelp, back to business as usual.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t see unbraced-ifs as this great security flaw, and I don&#x27;t see &#x27;fixing&#x27; it as curing some endemic problem with language design that&#x27;s going to lead us to not have bugs like this again. It&#x27;s too reactionary.<p>It may not be best-practice to do this, but I&#x27;ll admit there are times I want to add a quick one-liner check: &quot;if(already_initialized) return;&quot;, and it&#x27;s nice not having to put the extra braces there just because an Apple engineer once made a mistake.<p>For better or worse, the nature of technology is pragmatism, and not idealism. C let you use unbraced-ifs, and now it&#x27;s the most used language in the world. We can argue about how this should change, but it&#x27;s never going to. We can design a new language and maybe one day it&#x27;ll overtake C.

7600865,comment,7599422,7600775,4,0,Mz,,,"Thank you.<p>You said: <i>Lots of different things cause lots of different diseases.</i><p>Due to my genetic disorder, I am supposed to be overrun with disease and simply accept dying from it. I have been steadily getting well for the last thirteen years, which is very frequently met with incredibly dismissive feedback. (My favorite being: Thirteen years of steady forward progress is not evidence I know anything, it is mere wild coincidence. Stranger things have happened.)<p>My genetic disorder is known to cause the tissues to be too acid. There are multiple books about how the typical American diet is too acid. If you get certain kinds of sudden acidosis (this comes to mind: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_Ketoacidosis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_Ketoacidosis</a>), they will promptly hospitalize you because it can be deadly within 72 hours. Yet, it is not standard practice to treat or even test for acidosis with my condition. Ant-acids are only prescribed for gut issues like GERD and acid reflux which can occur with my condition. Anecdotally, other people with CF report that they have fewer lung issues when on acid blockers and similar for their gut issues.<p>Altering my diet to make my body less acid has been one of the cornerstones of getting myself well. I have seen articles linking anti-biotic resistance and biofilms to high acidity and seen research that biofilms can be broken up and anti-biotic resistance reversed if acidity is addressed. Yet, again, this remains not a standard treatment for my condition, which kills you by fostering infections and, ultimately, antibiotic resistance in those infections.<p>My life expectancy is not supposed to be that high for a modern Westerner. It is supposed to be roughly mid-thirties (granted, my form of CF has an undetermined life expectancy, yet I did nearly die in my mid thirties).<p>Anyway, I just know of lots of different bits of information linking inflammation, acidity, infection and many of the issues typical of my disorder. So a) I would really like to see more biochemical data (like ph balance of sample tissues) in studies of this sort and b) I am ...flummoxed as to why people seem to think we do not have enough data to say, yea, verily, acidity is a primary issue we should treat for to control symptoms of various conditions. (Because there are a lot of conditions associated with my genetic disorder but not unique to it, such as early onset osteoporosis, diabetes, arthritis and on and on.)",1397686704

In a cross assembler and scripting language I built, I enforced {}.<p>> What a terribly stupid thing for your language not to help you with!<p>Agreed! Anything that is an error should be caught. I even think it&#x27;d be nice if the compiler alerted you to dead code, which would have caught this bug.<p>> We can extend that to literally every error-mitigation tool we have.<p>Or we can take a balanced approach. Recognize that C is a low-level language. That it has very compelling benefits, but that they come with tremendous risks. We can approach the language with reverence. We can fix its glaring bugs without neutering it of its power or terse expressiveness.<p>Some people can&#x27;t handle it. And they should stick to higher-level languages, or at least stay away from backbone security libraries.<p>> From the other direction, look at Haskell.<p>I can&#x27;t really evaluate it, as I&#x27;ve never come in contact with a single application written in the language. It&#x27;s a wonderfully philosophic language, but real world usage indicates it is not at all practical.<p>> making your language less safe for the express purpose of making it less safe is just crazy<p>Yes it is.<p>> That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing when you keep around gotchas to keep out the noobs.<p>I am not suggesting we allow single-statement if&#x27;s to bar beginners from using C. I am suggesting that if you want to program in the language, you should learn the rules. Preferably before you start working on a crypto library. I know there are countless <i>insane</i>, esoteric edge cases, especially if you go on to C++.

Not saying it&#x27;s best practice (if I wrote the language, case labels would default to breaking without an explicit fallthrough keyword), but a C programmer should damn well know when they see that code that it is going to fall through.

It&#x27;s pushed me, helped me grow and yes, it exhausts me on some days.

About every weekend I just take a traditional app use case and try writing it from scratch.<p>And surprisingly, the shortcoming is always documentation shortfalls. It took me digging through code samples to find out activeFocusItem is a thing, for example.<p>Just note you can&#x27;t deploy QML only apps to mobile, you need a system with qmlscene installed already, but it is trivial to have a small C++ layer, and removing the JS only restriction gives you a huge amount more power over QML itself (building your own components in C++ vs combining them in JS).",1397685843

I am on the non-technical side of our team but I work closely with the devs and have recently attended a career fair at a university and was faced with the same problem. Grads came to us wanting to work with us but with little to no research on the company and the biggest thing to me was no reason as to why they wanted to work with us. Something I find for new grads, from any type of program, are lacking a foundation in how to find the right job for them. They panic and apply to every single job opening without stopping to think what is important to them in a job and what it is they actually want to do. All be it we all have to start somewhere, but starting somewhere you&#x27;re passionate about from the start is going to have a huge impact on how you begin your career!",1397685842

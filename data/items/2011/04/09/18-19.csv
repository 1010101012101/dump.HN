Let's me create a github repo where ""master"" is fixed at a known version (to me) and I can clone it to any machine without worrying about remembering a the hash for the tag I want.  I can push/pull at will and merge in changes from upstream whenever I desire.  Sometimes local changes stay local, sometimes they get pushed out.<p>Github and Bitbucket aren't only for working on code with other people, they also let us consume projects at the rate that we want to consume them.",1302375575

I've reviewed 10's of thousands of resumes and interviewed over 1,000 candidates so I know what you're going through.<p>Your points are well taken and insightful - and while they're especially true of technical hiring, they are also applicable for all start-up hiring. A smart person can learn the tech skills you need but it is  impossible to impart passion and an intuitive understanding of culture where it isn't already present.<p>I eventually honed my interviews down to one question: ""Please describe your most significant team accomplishment, where you were a key member of the team.""<p>Then I'd follow that with numerous follow up questions until I really understood the person's role. This will uncover the candidate's passions, communications skills, leadership abilities, and their technical prowess. Then I'd ask the same question about another accomplishment.<p>Good luck. I'll write you a note on the side with my contact info. I'd be happy to talk over any ""people stuff"" if you'd like.",1302375497

2427812,comment,2426655,2426939,5,0,danvet,,,"One of the best examples for an exam like this was the final exam in history at my high school. Half of it was a few class-wide topics of 20th century history. The other half was anything of the students choosing, I've chosen the policy of Perestroika of Gorbatschov and the downfall of the Sowjet Union.<p>The exam was simply a text snippet (dunno anymore whether newspaper or something more official) from the time about the reunion of the two Germans, and the assignment was to put it into greater context and connect it with other things that happened at the time, hereby explaining this particular incident. The questions for the general part were of similar spirit.<p>It's been one of the best exams I've ever had. Not just because I've got a straight A, but also because I've actually _learned_ something while writing it: It forced me to think about the knowledge I've already amassed from a different pov for two hours, greatly increasing my understanding of it.<p>I think every exam should be like that: If you haven't learned anything new while writing/having it, it's likely just pointless rendition of stuff learned by heart. And frankly, computers just beat humans at that ;-). Of course, doing this requires good teachers and quite an investment of time from them.",1302375414

Assume also that google will be able to identify at least a handful of ""Definite Humans"" and monitor their behavior.<p>Definite humans do certain things, like browse the web in certain predictable patterns, their +1 votes might cluster around certain interests, and generally ""human looking stuff"". Without enough data to look at I can't tell you exactly what that means but I'm assuming that patterns would emerge once compared with computers.<p>Assume that spammers manage to automate a certain number of google accounts to vote +1 on their web properties.  At the click of a button (in low orbital ion cannon style) thousands of robot-accounts log in to +1 against an individual link.<p>Now the spammers may find a way to stagger the automation of the logins, but unless they're particularly sophisticated how do they manage to create the rest of the simulation of a web-browsing individual?<p>Do they automate ""fake humans"" to run google searches from time to time?  Click about on links?  What about the analysis of the 'clustering' of accounts?  A given group of 1000 accounts always voting on the same things together?  What about the odd similarity that all the +1's seem to be routed through the same handful of IP addresses? What if +1'ing is closely related to other people +1'ing near your own geolocation?<p>I'm not saying it's going to be perfect, indeed they're buying themselves another ""arms race"" - it really would be interesting to investigate what proportion of Facebook's like button is being ""astro-turfed""<p>There's definitely going to be mechanical turk jobs to search my link, click +1 and such, but that exists for facebook as well.<p>I firmly believe that as clever as spammers are, there're not going to be able to accurately simulate the behavior of real humans for long.

You might also want to rate them based on vendor. Or, potentially very profitably, allow direct buying with the purchase automatically imported into the app. That's what my app was structured around. To get a more long-term hold you probably need to ""go social"" at some point.<p>(6) Hardcore tea snobs (this term should probably include myself) frequently brew tea in different pots, vessels.

It's much better to at the very least do serious research first (competitors, understanding and talking to possible customers, etc.), and have done proof-of-concept work for technical challenges, and done some design on your minimum-viable-product first version before worrying about a domain name, because it's so frequent to find some serious problem during that process that will cause you to abandon the project (or perhaps realize that you don't find it as interesting as you thought initially -- if you don't have some serious passion for solving this particular problem, it's not likely you'll have the motivation to get through the hard parts of building a business around it!).<p>If you've already gotten past those steps -- sure, go for it.

I can change the information on my domain to be whoever I want, particularly if I'm a scammer. Whatever I put in NameCheap's panel shows up minutes later. If someone doesn't believe me, I'll alter the registration on one of my domains. Just ask.<p>More interesting than that, however, is that the OP is completely aware that there are avenues of recourse for this and that he is technically able to determine who hosts the scraped domain. Rather than pursue those avenues of recourse, however -- said facilities have been keeping the Internet from devolving into a ""wild West,"" at least in ARIN and RIPE regions -- this guy had to take a play from 4chan's book and attack possibly the wrong guy. If everybody did what the OP does, you're absolutely right: the Internet <i>would</i> be a wild West.<p>As an administrator at a very large ISP, I am completely aware that some people lose faith in abuse desk contacts. At my employer, we receive countless abuse complaints and <i>we handle every single one</i>. This is a pattern you will observe in ARIN and RIPE regions, but less so for APNIC and other parts of the world (with exceptions). Particularly for someone hosted with JustHost, a DMCA complaint gets the job done in hours. If it doesn't you can go after the ISP. I was never a fan of the DMCA, but this is a prime example of a use case for it.<p>Above everything else, though, even if the OP is right about the identity of the scammer, calling out the scammer's employment means the OP could be attacking his family. If I were the aforementioned company I'd cut my losses and terminate the employee for bad PR. Now the OP has potentially hurt the suspected perpetrator's family based on actions his family is <i>probably not even familiar with</i>. Because he copied the HTML for a site I've never even heard of. That's icing on the cake, to me, because I protect my family. With teeth.<p>In short, I am totally unimpressed by the OP's vigilantism and I am equally disappointed that it is so popular in this forum.

I thought you were getting confused with the GPL, in which case it would be relevant. Now that we've cleared up that you know Android isn't GPL I have no idea why you think the timing of the binary release matters. I'd hazard a guess that you think people should act like the GPL applies to their Apache licensed code in order to be considered sufficiently ""Open Source"" by your definition, which differs from the standard meaning of simply releasing the code under an Open Source licence, which applies to the vast majority of Android code, and will soon apply to the Honeycomb code.<p>At which point they'll start work on the next version (Jelly?), and presumably you'll once again believe that Android isn't Open Source since having any code in development and not yet released fails your test. Or do they only fail your Open Source test if they ship a Jelly-powered device first? What if they ship a Jelly SDK image to run in a VM? Does your idea of when they have to have released source follow the GPL exactly, or does it differ in any important ways?",1302372576

How would one make the whole notion of ""Fifth Generation Aircraft"" obsolete?<p>How about Infrared Telescopes operating above the atmosphere? Right now, all fighter aircraft need to burn liquid fuels to extract energy in the form of rapid thermal expansion of gasses, which spew out the back or which operate turbines to run fans.<p>Large IR telescopes could be used to spot IR sources moving rapidly against the background, which could be localized and targeted by hypervelocity missiles. Stealth planes have a very reduced radar cross section, perhaps the size of a bird, but if you know exactly where the plane is, a radar guided missile could be made to home in on even a bird-sized return in the immediate vicinity.<p>Such telescopes could be deployed on suborbital rocket planes that can overfly the area on a moment's notice. They could also be placed on circling high altitude drones.<p>I'd bet that someone at DARPA has already gone through this thought process, and a program to disrupt 5th generation fighters already begun.

Seems perfectly reasonable to want to measure how effectivly they do their job.<p>The quality of the graduates of a college depend on a number of factors but probably the two most important are the quality incoming students and the college's ability to improve their quality. In effect colleges perform two functions: sorting and educating.<p>Sorting people based on standardized testing, high school grades, essays, recommendations, interviews and application details is a useful service in itself. However most of the value and almost all of the cost of colleges comes from educating not sorting.<p>The current college rating ""system"" can't possibly separate these two sources of quality. Clearly it would be something useful to know as within any group of similarly ranked colleges there will be differences in the quality of the education component.<p>All else being equal prospective students would choose the school that offered a best education. More applicants would to schools that were better at their primary mission, educating their students. In turn these schools could be more selective.<p>Building such a system will not be easy but should be very valuable. Please continue working on this Mr Gates.",1359841947

Two things make this industry different from other industries.<p>1) The ratio of males to females is worse. Women feel more like outsiders in tech than in other industries. Things like booth babes make us feel like outsiders because they are a ploy to attract MEN to the booth, as if there is no reason to attract women to the booth. Secondly, as a female at a conference, people assume I'm not the technical expert. They ask me if I'm in marketing. I see them directing technical questions to the males. It is really annoying to be judged based on your looks and gender, but I don't blame them, because chances are they are right due to the scarcity of female technologists. Booth babes reinforce the stereotype that women at the conference are there because they look nice and are friendly. That makes the problem even worse. Objectification in general reinforces the idea that a big part of women's role in society is to look good.<p>2) Tech is an area where people STILL question if women are really as capable as men. That makes women in tech more sensitive to gender bias.<p>In other words, it just stings more to see this coming from a tech company.",1359841501

I think it's more likely that your client-side code is doing something that interferes with the browser's event loop, and is thereby preventing the browser from processing ordinary operations like doubletap-to-zoom, scrolling, pinch-to-zoom, etc.  If you have a lot of JavaScript operations to perform, sometimes you need to defer some of them until the next time the event loop comes around  so that the browser can ""breathe"", as it were.<p>GWT, for example, has a DeferredCommand and IncrementalCommand facility for this situation.  I believe they are just wrapping the setTimeout(func, 0) trick. (See link below.) If Fay does not have such a facility, then you may need to do some upstream work to teach it how.<p><a href=""http://b.javascript.info/tutorial/events-and-timing-depth#asynchronous-events"" rel=""nofollow"">http://b.javascript.info/tutorial/events-and-timing-depth#as...</a><p>But I guarantee that even an iPad 2 should have enough oomph to tackle your modest needs.  It does just just fine on more intensive things like Google docs, spreadsheets, reader, and plus.  And Facebook.<p>If, for example, I have not yet asked the monads tutorial to compile and run a snippet, then the browser's JS thread should be entirely quiescent and the event loop should be responsive to my zoom, pan, and rotation requests.  That it isn't implicates your code (and/or the code Fay emits)  not the browser.  I hope the creators of Fay considered this while architecting it.  If they didn't, it's unlikely that they would have arrived at the correct solution by accident, because ordinarily compilers never need to worry about being ""a good citizen"" to a browser's event loop.<p>Best of luck.

Currently, it's my impression, a lot of patents are being granted for completely uncreative solutions to novel <i>problems</i>.  New technology (multi-touch screens, for example) creates new technical possibilities; along with those possibilities come a bunch of new problems.  People are coming upon these problems, solving them quite straightforwardly, and then patenting the solution.  It is exactly this I want to put a stop to, because I think it's this that is doing so much mischief.<p>Your second point is well taken.  I think you'd have to show that the patent was a primary cause of the success -- which, as you say, is rarely the case.  In any case, commercial success depends on a number of factors, and the courts would have to take that into account when weighing its probative value.<p>I don't think it's quite ""de facto abolition"", but yes, it is both my belief and my intention that this change in the rules would rule out most current software patents.<p>The few that remained would be for truly novel technology that would solve problems that were well known to be difficult.

As someone brought up in the US, the idea that someone who is second generation should be considered ""foreign"" is a strange concept. Someone born and raised in the US is an American. They might be a Cuban-American, Filipino-American, or Irish-American, but they are American. It wasn't until I visited Europe where I heard people regard the second- and even third-generation descendants as a foreigner. I still find it to be an odd and slightly disparaging view.<p>In any case, your guesstimate is silly, for three reasons. One: you can research it easy, so there's no need to guesstimate. If you want a serious discussion, then give actual numbers.<p>Two: the US is probably also less than 10%, given the restrictions you placed and using the actual definition of 'foreign born.' Of the 31,107,890 foreign born US residents for the 2000 census, 9,177,485 were from Mexico and 820,770 from Canada. The population of the US in 2000 was 250,314,015, so excluding neighboring countries, giving a non-neighboring-foreign-born population of 8.4%.<p>And three: you paint Eastern Europe with a wide brush. Look even at the languages. Romanian is a Romance language, Hungarian is the most widely spoken non-Indo-European language in Europe, Czech is a Slavic language. And as to culturally homogeneity in general? English has a phrase to describe the patchwork of cultures in south-eastern Europe - ""Balkanization.""<p>> Balkanization, or Balkanisation, is a geopolitical term, originally used to describe the process of fragmentation or division of a region or state into smaller regions or states that are often hostile or non-cooperative with each other.<p>Have you perhaps forgotten the Yugoslavian wars?<p>> The wars were complex: characterized by bitter ethnic conflicts among the peoples of the former Yugoslavia, mostly between Serbs (and to a lesser extent, Montenegrins) on the one side and Croats and Bosniaks (and to a lesser degree, Slovenes) on the other; but also between Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia<p>Your idea that there ""seems to be a strong homogeneity in eastern europe"" now is a complete denial of the observed facts.",1359839436

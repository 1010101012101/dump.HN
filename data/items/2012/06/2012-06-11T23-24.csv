But I'm sure even if this is the case, Amazon's volume more than makes up for it.<p>So yes, this rant is pretty pointless. This is the way every marketplace works nowadays: iTunes or Themeforest are the same. They take a big cut and reinvest the profits in marketing and advertising to grow the marketplace larger (and thus generate more profits for you in the long run).",1339459179

I don't think that was ever RMS' position.<p><i>As for freedom of speech, I think the analogy is flawed. The technology equivalent of speech is invention, and the freedom to invent doesn't require anything like the GPL. The freedom to tinker is more like the freedom to copyedit somebody else's work. And hey, I'm for it! Remix culture is great stuff. But it's not in the same league as freedom of speech.</i><p>That was specifically about X vs having the right to do X; I didn't meant to make a broad comparison between them. Subjects in analogies aren't supposed to map 1:1 in everything.<p><i>When it comes right down to it, though, I don't consider freedom of speech an end in its self either. The value of free speech is the sort of society it produces, not the speech its self. I favour limits to speech when the effect of that speech is not a net good to society. Now, those situations are few and far between, but they do exist. Yelling ""fire"" and all that; our legal system has a long and nuanced tradition of weighing the issue in various situations.</i><p>But ""fire"" is an exception mostly because Free Speech is supposed to protect <i>political</i> speech and we can say in a mostly objectively way that ""fire"" doesn't fit.<p>But what about political speeches that are arguably not a net good to society, like e.g. calls to pointless (in your opinion) wars?

If the Apple hardware ecosystem were open like that of Windows you'd have major companies all over the world evolving the platform in wonderful ways.  Performance would go up and prices would come down.<p>There are lots of use cases where the user couldn't give a crap about a nice and polished enclosure.  You are paying dearly for design you don't need.  If you want to pay for design, fine, do so, but to a lot of us it means nothing.<p>Case in point:  We have several workstations setup for Finite Element Analysis of heat and fluid flow.  They are dual quad core i965 Extremes.  They run overclocked at 4.0GHz with memory overclocked to 2.0GHz.  They have 64GB of DDR3.  All fluid cooled.  Tons of storage as well.  They also have dual NVidia graphics cards and sport three 24 inch 1920 x 1200 LCD monitors.  Total cost, about $3,500.  Including the three monitors and the OS hard drive.<p>These are monster machines in terms of performance and they still cost less than a Mac Pro.  We have three Mac Pro's as well.<p>I would really like to see Apple open it up.  A lot of interesting things could come of it.<p>Because their hardware is not subject to competitive forces, we will now be stuck with a less-than-desirable incremental update for probably three years, if not more.",1339458910

You'd be just as well off listening to any of the religious ""end of days"" rants.<p>Edit: Here's the actual paper: <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7401/full/nature11018.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7401/full/nature1...</a><p>I'll reserve my full judgement until I've read it, but I don't have high hopes. It seems quite odd to invent an entirely new scientific discipline in one fell swoop along with making such a bold prediction.<p>PPS: After reading the paper my opinion is that this is far more pseudoscience than not, by a wide margin. There are some points worthy of further study (biodiversity studies, effects of the impact of human activity comprising a large and growing part of the world's energy budget, changes in ecosystems due to fragmentation due to human activity, etc.) but this paper steams by those topics at a thousand miles an hour. There is no theory here, only the vaguest outlines of one. Even the core terms (state, state shift, forcings) are vauguely and generically defined, if at all. There is no model, no predictions, and no evidence.<p>Flatly put the ideas put forth here are non-falsifiable. At its simplest ""state shift theory"" can be boiled down to ""change causes change, sometimes permanently"". Figure 2 is a graph which plots ""global ecological state"" against ""global forcing"". There are no numbers and neither term is defined either quantitatively or qualitatively. As a side note the essay references the now debunked theory of Mt Kilimanjaro's glaciers melting due to global warming, despite the lack of evidence of local temperature increases there (the glaciers have been sublimating away and snowfall changes have failed to replace the lost material.)<p>Nature should be ashamed to have printed this, even in an editorial context. It is so lacking in hard scientific rigor and so generic and amenable to any interpretation (there is no evidence presented whether ""state change"" could be beneficial or detrimental to humans or to Earth's species) that it doesn't belong within a thousand meters of a journal as prestigious as Nature. There is even a chance, though admittedly slim, that this could be a hoax, the work of someone who wishes to discredit the scientific establishment of today and its seemingly infinite ability to bend its standards and tarnish its history to print anything so long as the conclusions are politically correct (human population reduction, switching to ""green"" energy and ""sustainable"" agriculture, etc.)<p>These topics are too important for us to abandon scientific rigor in our attempt to understand our world and how it works and will change. We cannot afford to slip into an era of superstition and ignorance where conclusions are assumed and evidence is irrelevant.",1339458550

The value of free speech is the sort of society it produces, not the speech its self. I favour limits to speech when the effect of that speech is <i>not</i> a net good to society. Now, those situations are few and far between, but they do exist.

It's a polemic subject I hope it doesn't start a flame war.<p>JavaScript is a very important language for web development. You can build web apps using it exclusivelly (called single-page applications) or running on a web server (with Node.js). I wouldn't advise any of these approaches to someone just learning web development, though. Single-page applications will required understanding and possibly implementing server APIs, and Node.js is a bit too new for beginners, or at least that's my perception.<p>Ruby (with Rails) is possibly one of the most popular choices nowadays for web development. I think the Ruby language itself is probably harder to fully grasp than others. But there's a lot of learning resources, just look for Rails books, tutorials and videos.<p>PHP is a very practical language, to extremes. It's newby-friendly and has been very popular. I have reservations about it because I think beginners are attracted to it and they don't know enough about pitfals (like, for instance, global variables) and end up creating code that can be very hard to understand, debug, maintain, not to speak keep safe against exploits.<p>Another popular option that's missing from your list is Python. It is a very good language, relatively simple to learn with less mystery than JavaScript or Ruby, for instance, and that promotes better code quality than PHP. Frameworks such as Django, web2py and Turbogears provide good foundations for web development (each in its own style). Django, for instance, has a great tutorial. And there are tons of learning resources about Python, such as <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/</a><p>So my advice, is, either learn enough Ruby to start playing with Rails, or try Python, possibly with Django.<p>Myself, I'm currently very happy with C# over the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC stack.<p>Good luck and feel free to ask any further questions.",1339457323

I knew it would be open for creative interpretations like yours.<p>I did not attribute the Internet to Microsoft.<p>What I said is that ""Microsoft enabled an incredible level of global competition""  and it is this competition that, in turn, allowed the internet to evolve into what we have today.<p>Yes, networking existed way before MS.<p>Yes, TBL wrote the first browser on NS.<p>Yes, MS played catch-up with browsers.<p>That is not the point.<p>Linux didn't begin life until 1991.  By that time the MS-ecosystem-driven PC evolution was very well under way.  Linus Torvalds wrote the initial version of Linux on a '386 based PC.  By that time PC clones ruled the world.  The evolution had gone through the 8086, 80186 and 80286 processors.  Machines cost a fraction of what the original true IBM PC cost, were faster and did a lot more.<p>None of this would have happened with a closed hardware model.  In fact, it did not.  Apple was around at the same time, of course.  They focused on keeping it all to themselves.  MS, in turn, just did the software and let everyone else figure out the hardware.  Yes, it was chaotic but it worked.<p>As the internet begun to heat-up it was Linux running on PC hardware that made it explode.  The internet required hardware to grow and explode into every corner of the world.  It was the cheap PC hardware that resulted from the evolution of the PC around the MS software that, among other things, enabled the internet to explode like it did.  Nobody can even attempt to credit Apple with any of that.<p>Again, I am not anti-Apple here.  Among other things, I develop iOS apps and have a nearly equal number of Windows and MacOS machine in the shop.  I will likely buy more Apple hardware in the next few months.  No issues there.<p>My original post was not about bashing Apple, it was to highlight my concern for the increasing closed-everything (not just hardware) approach Apple is taking --which is a fact.  In some cases it is almost despotic.  As a developer, that concerns me a great deal.  As a consumer, I prefer to see competition at all levels.

Maybe for grandparents, not parents.<p>I hate it how people use absolute numbers when comparing house values now to the past as it completely distorts the changes.<p>For example, a house worth $40k in 1970 and $300k today sounds like a good return, right?  However, that would not even be a 5% ""ROI"" compounded over that period.  When you take into account maintenance, property taxes and other home ownership costs, it's probably not even above the inflation rate.<p>Yet, when you look at the numbers on paper and see a nearly 8x increase, many people think ""Wow, what a great investment.""",1339455716

I see no other value in such posts because ""bad developers"" won't learn these things by reading about them ...or they'd be good developers.<p>That said, the list is subjective. I, for example, fall nicely through the cracks of this particular categorization:<p><i>""Bad developer only sticks to what he knows ... reaction to any technical change is negative""</i><p>A the moment I'm most definitely avoiding change because I have 64k LOC that I can either a) finish, or b) migrate to .NET 4.5.<p><i>""Good developer ... finishes several technical books a year.""</i><p>I haven't read a technical book in at least 4 years. But after 21 years' programming I own more tech books than many I work with have read, and I've read each and every one I own. So I'm actually quite comfortable with that.<p><i>""Good developer ... also very much concerned with the process quality""</i><p>Definitely not me. I had my process fix in the mid 90's and  could no longer care less. Where I'm the architect I get on with it. Where I'm a program manager I tell the team what I need, and couldn't care less who does it, how or where it's done, or by how many. I care only about if, when, and quality.<p><i>""Bad developer completes tasks.""</i><p>So should good developers. If all you ever do is to develop features which create value for customers, you're never going to get a product out the door.<p><i>""Bad developer always needs to allocate extra time to document and simplify.""</i><p>This one is definitely me. My design may evolve. The next feature may highlight a bad design decision in the last, but the temptation is always there to work on the next-next feature, rather than refactoring something you know needs it. It's just time management. Also, this is at odds with <i>""Good developer will ... always continue to clean and fix.""</i><p>There are no absolutes. You just do what you're able. If you're bad and smart enough to recognize that fact you'll become good. Q.E.D.",1339455705

My machine was recently upgraded from an old Mac Pro to a new Mac Mini. Even when I spam my machine with a half-dozen Adobe apps at once, I don't really hurt for performance.<p>Granted, some still need a Mac Pro to drive multiple huge monitors, cut video, add weird device interfaces, etc. Some will demand super expensive hardware for reasons more political than practical. All that said, overall, the publishing industry seems to be hitting a performance-plateau where the old Pro is no longer necessary among many practitioners.",1339455701

Apple still sells new 3GS phones, so it would directly impact customers that may be buying their products today.  This isn't the case with the iPad1.<p>Apple rarely does things (solely) based on technical requirements or some architectural vision. It may be frustrating, but it is consistent - they are primarily customer focused, not specs-focused or vision-focused.  Yes, there is attention to specs and an underlying vision of computing, but they are 2nd to the (paying) customers.",1339455682

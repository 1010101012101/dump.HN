1624955,comment,1624312,1624393,0,0,flatulent1,,,"There are many issues that complicate recycling.  There are many different types of plastics.  The possible uses and available processing methods differ.   There's the matter of sorting them, minimizing impurities, transport costs, energy of processing, issues with various toxic materials.<p>At least five years ago an electronics/metals/scrap/recycling dealer I spoke with told me he was shipping his monitor scraps to the central valley (California), near Kettleman City I believe.  He'd mentioned that there was a plant able to process the plastic from computer monitor cases into oil.  I doubt that it is a cheap way to get oil, and it probably can't produce huge amounts of it, but it is a good alternative to putting scrap in a landfill.  California collects a recycling fee with the purchase of monitors/TVs which goes to subsidize processing later.  I'm not sure if the conversion is cost effective without the subsidy, but it seems the right thing to do regardless.\nI believe there's another processor near Victorville California.  I heard they actually get quite a bit (over fifty cents a pound) for c.r.t. glass.  It contains a large amount of lead.<p>Dealing with our wastes can be dangerous business.<p><a href=""http://www.aboutlawsuits.com/california-cluster-birth-defects-kettleman-city-7970/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aboutlawsuits.com/california-cluster-birth-defect...</a><p>Huell Howser on PBS has had a number of shows relating to different kinds of recycling<p><a href=""http://www.calgold.com/green/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.calgold.com/green/</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo2Pl7UxbNo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo2Pl7UxbNo</a><p>I have to laugh and cringe when Huell keeps scooping up and pouring c.r.t. glass sand with his hand... no doubt throwing a bunch of lead dust in the air.

Going to visit someone has a major overhead, socially.  A quarter hour of conversation, at the least, before you can politely get to the subject of the visit, etc.  Phone conversations have some of the same costs to a lesser degree: it's quite rude not to devote your full attention to the call (or appear to do so), and there might well still be a few minutes of overhead.  With IM, you can almost just start talking.  It cuts through all the extra junk around actually having the interesting part of the conversation with a person, but you can still have an actual conversation (even while you both do other things as the other person types), which is important for discussing things at length.<p>Basically, I would say that calling and texting have very different social costs, but calling and visiting are much closer that way, and that this is why it's almost always better to text than call, even for extended conversations.",1282499835

There are probably other investment circles out there that concentrate on other things; I just don't know where they are or what they're up to.<p>But try getting a small team of brilliant young engineers, chemists, scientists, and mechanics together, and then go looking for VC to build a prototype electric sports car. Let's even say you've built most of the drivetrain and software already, and you're looking for VC so that you can afford a designer for it, flesh it out, shop it around to some shows, and make some connections.<p>Now, let's imagine you take a similar team of brilliant young people, and -- with only a few lines of code written -- you say, ""We want to build the next great social media app.""<p>I'd bet you're a lot more likely to see funding for the social media app than for the next electric sports car, and that makes perfect sense: the development of the social media app requires way less up-front expense, which in turn means it carries less risk, <i>and</i> it promises far earlier profitability if it's successful. If the electric sports car beats all expectations and finds a huge demand, you're still going to have to spend millions on a factory and tooling and everything else before money will begin to trickle in.<p>Here's the catch though: social media whatsits are also much less likely to <i>need</i> VC. Programming methodologies and technology have been developing at a breakneck pace for decades now. What used to take a room full of software engineers months to roll out can now instead be launched by two guys in a couple of weeks. Hell, some people on HN have gone and launched basic startups from scratch over a weekend. Now you can come up with an idea, order a VPS for 20 bucks from Linode, click to run a StackScript that will build your server for you, download a pre-built free PSD template, plug in jQuery and jQuery UI, spend a couple hours writing content, download some graphics, and then open up an AWS account and have your application backed by a massively scalable, highly reliable backend. Ding, done.<p>Fred Wilson's main concern -- that there isn't enough money to go around for these kinds of things -- is perfectly wrong, I think.<p>The neat thing about this is that everyone involved has been acting rationally according to their own self-interest, and this has resulted in the VCs self-selecting themselves into a niche that decreasingly needs them in order to be successful. At this point, if a web or software company has burned through a million dollars of investment and still isn't breaking even, then their business model is broken.<p>We also have to look at the lifecycles of these respective business approaches. Things seem to work out best for VCs if they get into a company that grows for a few years, but as Fred says, they're getting purchased earlier. Others are probably dying out faster. The overall life cycle for these businesses seems to be very short. (Myspace was launched in 2003, just 7 years ago; who here has an account with them?) The life cycle of the successful ""hard"" business meanwhile hasn't really changed much; the rule still seems to be that you have to work for three years before you'll be profitable (if you're not doing R&D, that is), and then as long as you're careful not to blow it, you can be around and be making fine money for decades.<p>...But VCs don't seem to be as interested in sending <i>those</i> kids to college.",1282497098

In other words, they perform an activity that they could be performing at home without having all these people around. Yet, they chose to go out and be among others. They don't talk to others, they don't even look at others in an obvious way, they seem to be pre-occupied and ignoring everyone, but on a certain level I think they are there more to be with others and whatever else they are doing is just a random activity they do so as not to look too weird staring at strangers.<p>(That probably means that I am the weird one staring at everyone...)",1282496632

If they are for the readers, how many readers are going to come back 24 hours later to check out the comments?<p>The idea that if you disagree or have a lot to say you should create your own blog post is also a bit ridiculous. Is it OK in that case to leave a comment saying ""I have responded to this on my blog here at xxxxxxx""? I mean, how is the context between the original post and the followup to be maintained or even seen by the original readers?<p>This just seems to be more of a throwback to old school print where the interconnectedness of ideas was severely limited. Unless you were aware of and read all publications on a subject you were likely to see the entire ""conversation"" on a subject.<p>I guess if you want to see a blog article as a publication that's your prerogative, but there is a reason print media is dieing out.

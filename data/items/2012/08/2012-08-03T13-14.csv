Take 20 more lines and you have a rendering loop and a sprite that moves with the arrow keys.<p>Processing (Java), PyGame (Python), and I'm sure many other libraries can do the same thing. They're also faster, cleaner, more robust, and you're not writing some insane garbled blend of JavaScript and GLSL with all the associated scaffolding code between the two vastly differently typed languages.<p>I would highly recommend Processing for any graphics playing that you might do. Yes, you have to write a bit more code (it is Java, after all), but it's also much more rewarding and just as portable as something written for WebGL.",1344002392

Yes, length can sound bullshitty but used well it can also provide helpful context.  In this specific example I do agree that it could be shorter but not necessarily by much.  Para 1 by itself doesn't say enough.<p>2) This is <i>highly</i> dependent on the type of company.  I guess for Moz-ers this is usual (same for the sign-off).<p>3) Normally I'd agree with you but in this example there's only one and it work in the email's favour (for me at least).",1344002362

You can provide installer for your players that just unpacks the game to directory and places shortcut in start menu (no dll-s, no register settings), you can pack your game into chrome app format for some users and place your game in chrome app store.<p>One thing I think chrome gets wrong is its security policy that by default prevents local web apps (when you open html file on your disk in browser directly) from doing ajax requests on the same directory. That means you need to wrap static assets in html, and that's stupid, I should be able to load xml from the directory my index.html is stored in.

I'm not sure about anyone else here, but after I learned a couple languages each additional language was ""that"" much easier to learn. While the syntax and general structure may vary from one to the next, the overall thought process is relatively the same.<p>In my opinion (and experience), a 60 year old with 30 years of programming experience across various languages would probably be a better programmer than a 27 year old of equal competence who only has, say, 5 years of professional experience.<p>Just because you're using a new language doesn't mean you can't draw from previous experiences. The same could be said for architects, animators or graphics designers. New software is constantly coming out but the style you've developed over the years is what can make or break you. Of course this isn't a perfect comparison to programming, but it's still a new set of tools to learn.",1344002202

I'm a huge fan of native games and all the oomph they can dish out.  Of course we're not going to see AAA titles in the browser any time soon and of course native games will ALWAYS have an advantage, at least performance wise, over browser games since they don't have the browser and javascript overheads.<p>That being said, there are both native and browser games that are great, just like there are some that are mediocre.  The browser is imho a great place to prototype a game, make a first game as a newbie or even publish something that's not too resource hungry.<p>I'd even go as far as saying that WebGL will stimulate the development of native games as well.  WebGL based game development is a lot closer to native game development in a way than Flash games are (at least from my limited experience) so new developers might make the switch more easily when their needs exceed what the browser can give them.

Many of you may dismiss this as old-fashioned, and sexist, but it's very true. Don't forget that in the past, families lived together. Grandmas, aunts, uncles, sisters, EVERYONE in 1 roof. Which meant the mother had a ton of help. Today, we live in an entirely different society, and mothers usually are alone in caregiving. I blame society for getting rid of this family structure.",1344001821

Overall the mail is too long for what it needs to say. Don't kid yourself that extra bulk makes bad news more attractive it doesn't, it just irritates people that you're wasting their time as well as doing stuff they don't like. If you want a bullshit free mail, always check the length - if it's longer than it has to be there's a good chance that a lot of the excess is bullshit.<p>2) The second one makes one of the worst mistakes in these situations and goes with the ""I'm one of you"" approach. In my experience little gets people's backs up more than this. As CEO you're not one of the team when it comes to this stuff. Yes you can make out you're doing it but volunteering information is different to being asked for it - it doesn't have the implied lack of trust. As a general rule don't pretend you're the same unless you're sure you really are in every way, not just superficial ones.<p>3) Different writing styles and all but I'd never include an exclamation mark in a ""bad news"" e-mail. Exclamation marks usually say funny / whacky, neither of which are things you want anywhere near bad news.<p>All that said, paragraphs one, three and four are good, actually very good - explains what's happening and why.

The existence of regulations with compliance burdens will tend to make firms bigger than they would otherwise be, but many and probably most transaction costs aren't due to government, and there would be many additional sorts of transactions costs if there weren't a government at all.<p><i>And could it be, that certain structures are less optimal (profitable) for the single ""firm"", but more optimal for the economy as awhole. Could there even be a distinction?</i><p>It probably could, depending on what you mean by ""optimal"".  Its pretty well established[1] that in the absence of transaction costs you can get a Pareto efficient[2] outcome, but Pareto efficiency is probably not the same thing you would call optimal (though what you'd call optimal is almost certainly Pareto efficient).<p>I would tend to expect that, given that we live in a world with transaction costs, firms are not the ideal size.  But its hard to say whether firms ought to be bigger in general or smaller.  Countries with relatively efficient economies (Germany) tend to have larger firms than countries with less efficient economies (Italy) but its really hard to tease out in those cases which way causality is flowing.  Most countries tend to have laws that favor small businesses, and those might end up more than making up for their proportionally higher regulatory burden.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare_economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare...</a>

4333966,comment,4332037,4333895,2,0,PakG1,,,"I was a venue technology manager for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics.  I can't speak for everything regarding how wireless communication tools were used, but anything that was scoring-related, application-related, or PC-related had to run on hard network lines.  Wifi was deemed too risky for ensuring connectivity, even on non-Games-critical systems and processes.  We had only a couple of exceptions (example: every venue had an Athlete's Lounge, and every Athlete's Lounge had wifi for the athletes).  I could be wrong, but I don't believe wifi was allowed for any operations-related purposes.<p>We literally dug trenches in concrete and in mountainsides to lay fibre and copper, rather than rely on wifi, even where there were concentrated temporary buildings or trailers at outdoor venues.<p>The only valid uses for wireless that I recall were radios for security and general Games operations (security and general operations had different spectrum, if I recall, with the general operations being further separated into different bandings, depending on the type of operations), plus mobile phones.<p>I'm sure there were various other wireless communication tools.  For example, in rare cases where there was no way to get coax somewhere for TV screens (i.e. like the top of a mountain), we installed satellite dishes instead, after making sure that line of sight was OK.  But although I can't think of much else, I'm sure there were plenty.  I regularly spoke with the Games spectrum manager about setting up his infrastructure requirements, as they were going to set up operations at each venue for monitoring the airwaves and detecting rogue signals, or overreaching signals.  It wasn't simply some man walking around with some device.  It was pretty heavy-duty equipment.<p>But to be clear, things like referring and planning, I can't imagine relying on wireless communication tools all that much, if at all.  Especially timing and scoring.  The timing and scoring requirements were the most mission-critical stuff.  I've never been treated like shit as much as the Omega guys treated me because we weren't finished their photo-finish stuff by the time they arrived, though we were of course ready by opening day.<p>edit:  OK, if I recall, the broadcasters may have wanted spectrum for their own uses.  And the press tents definitely all had wireless for the journalists and photographers also.  But nothing else crosses my mind.  Here's another example how important it was to have the hard lines.  We dug trenches all the way up Whistler Creekside to lay down the fibre and timing cables for the alpine skiing course.  This way, photographers could take photos of the racers, jack into the fibre via some mobile sheltered switches (they were on modified sleds) we set up on the course, and the photos would arrive down at the bottom for editing and collating before the racers reached the bottom.  That way as soon as a result was announced, any newspaper/sports/etc website could put up their article with photo almost instantaneously after the racer finished.  That would not have been possible with wireless.<p>edit2:  Sorry, reading this, I realize it's not very well written.  Points all over the place, nothing in order.  Sorry, guess I'll just leave it as it is.",1344001713

People are 100% going to be depressed if they have a hearing imbalance at 1,000 Hz; Imbalance is if say in one ear the lowest you can hear is 11 Dbs, and the other ear you can hear at 14 Dbs - that shows an imbalance of 3 Dbs. The sound therapy I listed helps let the mind 'release' and equalize those imbalances. If you have an imbalance at 1,000 Hz then medication won't he, cognitive behaviour therapy won't help.

An animal will grow very big, much bigger than any single group of amoeba, but it is vulnerable. Stab it and it dies; once the central nervous system is dead, all other cells will die off eventually. You can't stab a group of amoeba. To kill amoeba you have to kill every single individual one.<p>Large companies today are much more likely to make mergers and acquisitions than to make divestments. Divestments are only made when a group within the company appears to be unlike any other. I think horizontal companies are more likely than large companies to make divestments.

Modern machines are so powerful there's no reason not to be running the full stack on every dev desktop, built from the same process that builds your live servers. You might not catch performance issues before going into production, but outright failures should be vanishingly rare. Deploying frequently is valuable but more of a side effect of having a good build process; the real value comes from it being automatic and reliable.",1344000114

Its possible, after all, to imagine a society in which everyone works for the government. Or, conversely, one in which everyone is an independent contractor. Why have some intermediate version consisting of at least two people but less than everyone on the planet?<p>The answer is straightforward application of the Coase Theorem. Companies exist because they optimally address internal and external coordination costs. In general, as an entity grows, so do its internal coordination costs. But its external coordination costs fall. Totalitarian government is entity writ large; external coordination is easy, since those costs are zero. But internal coordination, as Hayek and the Austrians showed, is hard and costly; central planning doesnt work.<p>The flipside is that internal coordination costs for independent contractors are zero, but external coordination costs (uniquely contracting with absolutely everybody one deals with) are very high, possibly paralyzingly so.

Luckily, we had written the app in such a way that we could quickly disable the facebook features, and still have a functional app.  If it had been critical to have facebook, the event would have been ruined, and our clients would have fired us.  We contacted facebook, and our conversation went something like this:<p>FB auto message: our very amazing and awesome malware detector, which uses all this cool machine learning and is amazing, has detected that your site is malware and we are disabling it.<p>Us: Our site is not malware, it's just suddenly very popular.  Please turn it back on.<p><i>1 week later</i><p>FB rep: You site appears to be on, please refer to the documentation for how to connect to our services, do not violate the terms of use agreement.<p>Us: Ok, it does appear to be back on now.  Why was it shut off?<p>FB rep: You violated the terms of use agreement.<p>Us:  How did we do that?  Could you explain what term we violated, so we can modify our code appropriately?<p>FB rep:  Do not violate the terms of use agreement.<p>Us: Ok, but which term?  Are you sure your automated system didn't just shut the site down because it went viral?<p>FB rep: <i>no response, ever again</i><p>We never changed the code, site continued to work fine.  As a result, I live in fear that something like this could happen again, in a situation where facebook was a critical component.  Did the ability to contact a human help in this situation? Unclear. They definitely did a good job of making us feel worthless and unimportant.",1343999059

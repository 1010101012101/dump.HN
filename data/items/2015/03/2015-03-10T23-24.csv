This is the difference between Winning and Losing game.<p>He uses chess but it reminds me of Go.  Many people are very proud merely to learn the rules... then comes a long phase (where I am still at) where the game reduces to two people clobbering reach other and somebody wins (mostly by chance).  As you move up the ladder, the players are more skilled and the role of chance diminishes.  After a certain point (usually called 1 dan), both players are skilled enough to implement the most basic strategies and avoid the most common mistakes.  Then it becomes the beautiful game of skill we hear so much about.",1426031902
9181635,comment,9180795,9180795,0,0,jdbernard,,,"I hate to post the &quot;I agree&quot; comment, but this article is too valuable in my opinion to just leave with no comment so here are a couple of quotes that put some of my feelings into words very accurately:<p><i>Both groups [geek feminists and brogrammers] are latecomers barging in on a cultural space that was once a respite for us, and we don’t appreciate either group bringing its cultural conflicts into our space in a way that demands we choose one side or the other. That’s a false dichotomy, and false dichotomies make us want to tear our hair out.</i><p><i>I’m not claiming that’s entirely rational, because fear isn’t rational, but it sure does explain the response to being told that our culture is broken and must be adapted to accommodate the very people who rallied it into being by shunning us from theirs.</i><p><i>Trying to convince hacker culture to change its norms by appealing to progressive values alone won’t work. You’re going to have to appeal to hacker values, and nobody’s done that yet.</i><p><i>leading with “there are more of us than there are of you, so you have to change to accommodate us” is, hands down, the best way to ensure that your carefully constructed appeal will fall on deaf ears.</i><p>We made these communities to escape the people that tried to force their norms and values on us, who tried to pass judgement on us and ostracise us because of our differences. So it should be obvious why we circle the wagons when someone comes with accusations, demanding access to our group and insinuating that our reluctance to accept them is due to something wrong with us, something bad that we have done. They are acting exactly like the kind of people we&#x27;re trying to keep out. I&#x27;m not saying we&#x27;re perfect and have no biases of our own, but trying to force your way via moral or social might is not going to work.",1426031896

The person looking at the boobs, may nor may not be aware how obvious it is. Not that this makes it okay but it means they have no internal conviction to change the behaviour.<p>And it may be equally possible that some of the &#x27;feeling you get from someone&#x27; could be a total miss read. As long as nothing is said nothing changes. I think a culture where people are willing to deal with the discomfort this sort of thing brings would help. Also a culture where people are not thrown under the bus at the first hint of a problem. It is seen as too much of a risk, to have either an offender or a victim of sexual harassment on staff because of the legal repercussions and that&#x27;s not okay, that keeps things hidden.<p>There is also the more blatant instance of sexual harassment in the industry (well in every industry) but I think it&#x27;s a case of the broken window effect.

There is something to be said for face to face interaction between founders and other founders, and between founders and mentors. It&#x27;s possible that video or tele conferencing could be just as effective, but apparently they prefer to do business in person.<p>They&#x27;ve never said, at least publicly, that the best ideas are found among people who are of a certain age or parental status. They have said that they think it&#x27;s better if all of the startups they fund in a batch are in one geographic location for X number of months. It&#x27;s a matter of preference, not a moral judgement. Anecdotally, several of the YC partners have families and children of their own. I find it hard to believe that they aren&#x27;t sensitive to the situation you&#x27;re describing.<p><i>Personally</i>, I think that doing a startup can be very difficult and demanding. It&#x27;s been known to put a strain on family relationships. I would encourage people with families to think twice and to put in a lot of extra effort in the planning, research and MVP stages. It&#x27;s one thing for a 20 year old to go through the stress of a startup, it&#x27;s another when the lives of children are involved. I&#x27;ve seen the experience test people and get the better of them.

Other stats bear this out, google around (or look elsewhere in this thread).<p>> They can only if they&#x27;re inappropriate and unwanted... and so frequent or severe enough.  Which honest complements cannot be.<p>I believe Vic Gundotera was honest when he was sexually harassing Kelly Ellis via compliments.  Why is honesty a defense?  Intent is irrelevant in harassment; it&#x27;s the environment the harasser creates and the feelings the victim feels.<p>I think you&#x27;re misusing the term &quot;honest compliments&quot;.  If I were to tell a woman, &quot;hey your legs are very attractive&quot;, that&#x27;s an honest compliment.  It&#x27;s also sexual harassment if I keep doing it.  I think when you say &quot;honest compliment&quot;, you mean &quot;hey nice shoes&quot;.<p>The problem is, which parts of a woman&#x27;s appearance can you compliment without being sexual?  Avoid her body?  &quot;Hey nice skirt&quot; is still pretty sexual.  &quot;Hey nice hose&quot;, &quot;hey nice necklace&quot;, hey nice blouse&quot;, etc. can all draw attention to parts of a woman&#x27;s body.  Tone can also be a factor.  &quot;Hey nice hair&quot; said in one tone can seem like what you would call an &quot;honest compliment&quot;.  &quot;Hey nice hair&quot; with a certain tone and closeness can imply, &quot;I&#x27;d like to run my fingers through it&quot;.<p>1 in 4 women experiences workplace sexual harassment.  It&#x27;s very possible they associate comments about their appearance with that experience.  They shouldn&#x27;t have to opt-out of your compliments.<p>How can you avoid all of tihs?  Stop complimenting a woman&#x27;s appearance.<p>> I&#x27;d ask you to point out a single case of proven sexual harassment based on someone simply paying complements to a co-worker, but it&#x27;s probably not worth your time.<p>You should just google around for legal advice regarding comments on appearance being sexual harassment.  It&#x27;s absolutely sexual harassment if it is frequent or severe enough.  I just googled &quot;workplace appearance comments harassing&quot;, and basically all the results were good.<p>> You&#x27;re overgeneralizing here. In most workplaces physical appearance is absolutely relevant to some degree.<p>Only if it becomes a problem.  And I&#x27;m overgeneralizing because that should be the default approach.  Don&#x27;t comment on a woman&#x27;s appearance unless necessary.<p>> Interaction with humans is a large part of most workplaces, and conversing with, building rapport, trust, shared understanding and common goals is a major component of most workplaces.<p>Which is all why you should be professional and appropriate, because in most workplaces you <i></i>have to<i></i> interact with others, and women shouldn&#x27;t suffer these kinds of &quot;compliments&quot; just to have a job.  The things you listed are critical to creating a positive work environment.  When women are constantly judged by and harassed based on their appearance, that positive work environment dissipates.<p>> The damage in sterilizing the workplace of this type of camaraderie far outweighs to potential for harm.<p>This is hyperbole.  There are already tons of topics completely unsuitable for the workplace.  Adding one more doesn&#x27;t suddenly make the workplace &quot;sterile&quot;.  Feel free to talk about crazy things that happened to you, or food that you&#x27;ve eaten, or sports, or any one of a million things humans experience.<p>> Huh, what?! That&#x27;s not what I said at all, please re-read it. I think something just shifted in your tone, and I&#x27;m sorry to see it go in that direction. Please try to remain charitable in light of the limited bandwidth of the communication medium. I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say, probably because I was trying to be too cute while saying it.<p>I&#x27;m trying to assume the best, but this logic is the kind of logic street harassers use to justify their behavior.  &quot;She wouldn&#x27;t dress that way unless she wanted compliments&quot;, or &quot;it would be an insult not to holler at that dress&quot;.  I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re a bad person.  I&#x27;m saying, from what you&#x27;ve been writing here, that your behavior is problematic.<p>I appreciate that the context is different, but I don&#x27;t think that you appreciate that the difference in context matters very little.<p>> Please keep <i>ad hominem</i> out of it, because I&#x27;m actually trying to have a productive conversation here.<p>I wasn&#x27;t specifically talking about you.  I&#x27;m saying that belief indicates a strong sense of entitlement.  If you&#x27;re of that belief, then I think you&#x27;re entitled.  I don&#x27;t know how to correct someone&#x27;s behavior without saying their behavior is bad.<p>> I&#x27;m not complaining about how onerous it would be for me to stop complementing someone. What I think we do need to protect is our ability to be human and humane to one another, to empathize with one another, and to have the option of connecting on a remotely personal level to people we spend the majority of our days with. I think this happens naturally and copacetically 99.99% of the time.<p>1 in 4 women experiences sexual harassment in the workplace.  Often they experience it multiple times, especially women in low-wage jobs.  In my workplace, we don&#x27;t comment on the appearance of women, and we still manage to have a blast.  For Christmas, we went to an Irish pub together and swapped hilarious stories.  Someone told stories about competing in a triathlon, someone else told stories from when they were in boot camp.  I wouldn&#x27;t call us friends per se, but I would say we&#x27;re very collegial.  Your assertion that banning comments on women&#x27;s appearances would sterilize the workplace is simply not true.  So don&#x27;t worry about it :).<p>Instead, worry about how millions and millions of women are sexually harassed every day.  I really think that issue is far, far bigger.",1426030972

(And in my experience, it&#x27;s rare to add mixins to a component after it&#x27;s written.)<p>ES6 classes aren&#x27;t suitable for everyone yet (&quot;Ask your doctor if ES6 classes…&quot;) but they&#x27;re a new API which is more convenient for some use cases, so we chose to add it now instead of waiting until we&#x27;re at perfect feature parity to give people the chance to use the new syntax.",1426029850

But this only gets you so far. It adds a lot of complexity to your implementation, and provides no clue to developers that they&#x27;ve violated a particular constraint and their code is running 10x slower than it could do. Furthermore, different runtime implementations from different vendors may have different heuristics and fast path behaviours.<p>Having a standardised subset of the language, marked by a backwards compatible pseudo-pragma (like &#x27;use strong&#x27;) lets developers opt in to explicit constraints that enable greater optimisation. These constraints are common across different runtimes, properly documented, and are enforced by fail-early checking.

There may be countries that don&#x27;t have a custom of tipping and also have poor service, but there&#x27;s very little reason to think that the two are actually related. For the same reason, there&#x27;s very little to think that level of service in restaurants in the US is related to the expectation of the tip.<p>More generally, if a country seems to have poor restaurant service overall, that&#x27;s a cultural thing. Introducing tipping would be unlikely to change it. To think otherwise is to think that waiters are only doing their job on the hope that they get a consideration, and that without that financial lure, they&#x27;d become lazy do-nothings. And that&#x27;s both highly insulting and also illogical, because there&#x27;s nothing unique about the job of being a waiter that would cause people to be lazy who would otherwise perform their job adequately in every other industry.",1426028857

Of all of these, Uber is the only one I can think of that explicitly doesn&#x27;t provide a means to tip. Most of these companies do offer a way to tip (although they generally leave the default at $0). When I use one of these companies, occasionally I ask the driver / delivery person / whoever what the expectation is, and usually the answer is something along the lines of the tip is completely optional and is provided because some people explicitly want to tip. But this answer is very unsatisfying, since I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re being truthful or if they&#x27;ve been instructed to tell people it&#x27;s optional.

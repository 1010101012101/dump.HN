So, whatever happens will happen with or without you paying.  From that point of view, you might as well save your money, no?<p>Of course, if everyone thought that way, things would go differently, and the experiment would fail.  So, yes, homo economicus is too simple, but does provide food for thought.<p>I'm a lot happier with restaurants in Italy, where there is no tipping.  You pay a fair price for the meal, and that's that.  Most of the time you get good service, sometimes you get bad service, but not out of proportion to how things are in the states or here in Austria.  And the food is way better in any case:-)",1192614978

Graphite pencils are a really bad idea in zero gravity: They can break easily, freeing hazardous splinters (not a problem with gravity, since if you encounter them it's likely to be with your feet -- but without gravity, splinters could easily end up in your eyes), they are flammable (obvious issues here), and when you use them graphite dust is released which (in zero gravity) can end up causing short circuits in electronics.",1192613242
68994,comment,68901,68901,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think that article was quite stupid. Sorry, but I didn't pay because I felt like tipping. I paid for inrainbows for the following reasons: <p>1.) I want radiohead to make more albums, so I wanted to show them that it is worth doing so.\n2.) I want to hurt the RIAA (and other evil players) by showing them that they are not necessary anymore. Ideally, the success of the inrainbows scheme would lead to copycats, meaning more cheap and free music for me.<p>I think those reasons are perfectly rational. It pisses me off (sorry, but really!) if wannabe economists claim that rational beings should pay nothing.<p>Nor is tipping very puzzling: it guarantees that I get a friendly waitress in the restaurant, because if she is treating me badly, there will be no tip. OK, you have to think around several corners (ie pay it forward) to realize that, but the whole society works that way. It is not an impossible train of thoughts. If I don't tip, my fellow humans will suffer (angry cab driver), so if they hear about it, they will punish me. I think in the US waiters even come after you shouting if you don't tip. ",1192613153

Up until that stage, there may be no point, unless of course the relationship with the entrepreneur is valued enough to do so. As a solution, how about YC offering public feedback to the rejected applicants willing to expose themselves publicly. Also, I am curious to know if scorecards are used.<p>Also, it would be great to see a YC applicant actually develop a system for the applications themselves making feedback and follow-up easier for YC staff.<p>So, if systems were in place to handle these types of apply-check-judge-accept/reject-feedback-followup processes better, I'm confident better outcomes could be reached.<p>Anaphoric's comment (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=68979"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=68979</a>) such a system could be used by that manager who rejects at random.",1192612542

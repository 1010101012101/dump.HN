10768082,comment,10768020,10768020,0,0,api,,,"It&#x27;s tough because infosec is a terribly inefficient market.<p>The vast majority of end users don&#x27;t care about security <i>until they are impacted by it</i>, at which point they blame the vendor and scramble for a quick fix and then quickly go back to not caring. As a result, end users are rarely customers for security. (Or privacy, which really is just a form of security.)<p>The vast majority of vendors do care something about security, but the knowledge and skill of actually understandings security is rare. Therefore most of the actual customers for security are <i>ignorant customers</i> who are looking for something that will make them <i>feel</i> secure.<p>Ignorant customers tend to fall back on secondary indicators of status such as name and brand recognition and the opinions of those who are deemed experts in a given field.<p>This makes security a bit of an in-club, where experts recommend each other through their expert advice. It also makes security a field where snake oil can get a lot of traction if it can correctly mimic these secondary signals or can piggyback on them. All fields with ignorant customer bases tend to be somewhat status-indicator-driven and anti-meritocratic.<p>I&#x27;d advocate focusing your efforts more narrowly at breaking into this market on the positive (non-snake-oil) side. There are three ways I can think of to do this:<p>(1) Try to get a job with a highly regarded security firm.<p>(2) Look for the things that vendors use as secondary indicators such as certifications, and try to get at least one of those. Then use that to break into the market and start building a reputation.<p>(3) Target a specific popular software product (e.g. OpenSSL, nginx, Apache, etc.) and identify a real vulnerability. Then &quot;market&quot; this vulnerability with a catchy name that will get you some recognition as its discoverer. Then use this as a credential. But be sure the thing you identify is real enough to impress those who do understand security or this could backfire a bit.<p>For #3 I would highly suggest wading into the probably very shark infested waters of NodeJS and popular NPM packages. Node is the Hot New Thing and development has been progressing rapidly and chances are popular Node security and authentication packages are riddled with non-obvious holes. It&#x27;s likely that you could identify a single insecure programming practice that is systematically encouraged by the nature of the JavaScript programming language and then bag dozens of vulnerabilities based on it by searching code bases for that pattern. &quot;Eval&quot; or any form of it has been a likely candidate in the past but that one is mostly common knowledge today, so you&#x27;ll probably have to find a less obvious one. The core Node code might also be a fruitful place to look, since we (at my venture) recently had to delve into it a bit and it&#x27;s a chthonic blob of C code if I ever saw one. Start with libuv, but keep some eye bleach and religious iconography handy.",1450641546

10768019,comment,10766243,10767575,0,0,tibbon,,,"UI, immediacy, chaos/entropy, and compatibility/flexibility.<p>The UI of a modular is great. There is (generally, a few digital modules have menus/modes) only one function per knob/button/jack. Everything is pretty obvious as to its function. The workflow <i>feels</i> creative, in a way that programming CSound or MAX/MSP never did to me. I sit at a computer ~8+ hours a day coding as-is, do I really want to do that for my instrument? I generally just set ProTools to start recording, and then turn off my monitor and ignore the computer.<p>Immediacy of modular synths is amazing. The sound you have now <i>is</i> now, once you unpatch or turn knobs you aren&#x27;t getting it back. Even if you take photos, you&#x27;re unlikely to get it back again. That&#x27;s part of the great part. It isn&#x27;t a preset that you&#x27;re using. You&#x27;re using something that you put together. For live performance, this adds a really neat aspect of danger. Is there really much danger (aside from a system crash) of hitting &#x27;play&#x27; in Ableton? No. But the modular can do all sorts of stupid things, which leads me to my next point.<p>The chaos and entropy in these systems is great. Sometimes you use patch cords that are too long and get some crosstalk/resistance that you weren&#x27;t accounting for. Sometimes there&#x27;s noise. Sometimes things skip and don&#x27;t play in 4/4 as you were expecting (I had a weird clocking issue/ghost in the machine last week, that caused it to basically make its own drum fills... without any unit dedicated to that). For creativity, this is like a drug. The sound you&#x27;re making will almost certainly not be the sound anyone else is using- period. That&#x27;s pretty damn cool.<p>Flexibility/compatibility. Voltage is voltage. If you don&#x27;t care about tracking pitches to a 12-tone scale, then there are practically no limits to what units will work together. A modular from the 70&#x27;s can patch in with my current eurorack, and also my Minimoog Voyager- your software from 1970&#x27;s probably doesn&#x27;t work great with your iPad. My modular has stuff from around a dozen makers, and I have another dozen guitar pedals, mini synths, and such that also can deal with control voltage stuff. I can make little Arduino toys trivially that will work with it as well. I don&#x27;t have to deal with different plugin formats, outdated systems (Protools TDM anyone?), inter-system issues, etc. It just works and that&#x27;s pretty amazing.<p>Of course, I do have a computer hooked up to my recording gear, but it rarely gets used until I really have the idea ready to go. I&#x27;m thinking of getting an 8-track tape machine so I can remove the computer entirely.",1450640458

Nobody ever got fired for listening to such people.<p>(2) These investments blew up in their faces because these models were wrong. Specifically the problem with those models was the problem with all such closed-form models of open dynamical systems: by taking large positions on the basis of fixed closed-form models, they actually <i>altered the system so as to invalidate those models.</i> That&#x27;s because dynamical living systems like economies have feedback loops. More specifically for this case: by relying upon models based on the stability of mortgages, positions were taken that made mortgages less stable such as by encouraging more sub-prime lending and by causing a housing bubble.<p>(3) As the crisis erupted, a massive scramble ensued to <i>do something</i> with huge numbers of people -- some very powerful, wealthy, and connected -- running every which way executing anything they could think of to prevent the next great depression or worse.<p>(4) In the confusion, those with the most political power, connections, and access to real wealth tended to prevail... as is usually the case, and in that order. In a fire with no marked exit routes those who are first to the exit and/or physically strongest will get out first too.<p>(5) After the crisis anyone with any kind of political agenda started to pick through the ashes to cherry pick evidence to bolster their pet thesis, implicate their pet enemy, or just sling outrage to get clicks.<p>Where&#x27;s the mystery here?<p>The only &quot;solution&quot; is to reform the financial system so as to put systematic, open, clear safeguards in place so that next time -- and there <i>will be a next time</i> -- this happens, everyone knows what to do. This is why buildings usually have prominently displayed exit paths in case of fire, etc.<p>I&#x27;m too ignorant of high finance to know what that path should be, but here&#x27;s a layman&#x27;s suggestion anyway: what if under certain objectively determinable crisis conditions the fed made available a window for <i>anyone</i> to borrow <i>any amount of money</i> at some multiple of the current base rate? This would allow anyone -- from banks down to actual homeowners and businesses -- to temporarily cover themselves until people can figure out what the F is going on and things can unroll in an orderly fashion. This loan would have an escalating interest rate over a period of years, so all would be incentivized to pay it back, but it would give people time to assess the situation. Perhaps that or some version of it could work. The whole problem with these crises is that they can unroll much faster than anyone can think, leading to a lot of stupid decisions that make the crisis worse (analogous to rushing a single exit during a fire) or that result in massively unfair outcome. In some cases these might be corruption and opportunism, but in many cases I think it&#x27;s just stupidity under stress. The goal of something like the aforementioned would be to &quot;slow down time&quot; a little.<p>Edit: a possibly better version would be this: in the event of a systematic financial crisis, the fed is empowered to bail out the consumer progressively. This would &quot;trickle up&quot; and prevent the entire financial system from collapsing, but would remove the most obvious forms of moral hazard at the top. Furthermore if the &quot;angry liberal&quot; version of reality is actually true and the financial elite are working tirelessly to keep the poor man down, that means they now have an incentive to do their damn job correctly and prevent a crisis from emerging in the first place.",1450640152

And because they don&#x27;t want to rely on C99 or distract by opening  a new block, they put the conversion at the top of the function.

I consider myself an expert C programmer, and I think it&#x27;s undefined in C99, but I wouldn&#x27;t bet that I&#x27;ve correctly understood the issues for the other dialects of C, muchless C++.

Unfortunately, this ends up happening in many cases (usually with abstract things such as pure mathematics or classical music, where appreciation is difficult without context). But in most cases, you produce things that can be appreciated by others, regardless of their interest in the process. If you knit your friend or loved one a cool scarf, they don&#x27;t necessarily need to be interested in knitting to enjoy wearing it. And if you&#x27;re a great baker, someone doesn&#x27;t need to know anything about baking to enjoy your creations.<p>All the same, ordinary people can have valid negative opinions of things that they aren&#x27;t proficient in. When a scarf has numerous dropped stitches or a pie doesn&#x27;t taste quite right, many people can make observations and express their distaste. Just because they aren&#x27;t knitters or bakers doesn&#x27;t mean that their critique doesn&#x27;t &quot;count for anything.&quot; They might not be able to pinpoint the part of the process where something went wrong, but that still doesn&#x27;t invalidate their opinion.<p>In this case, the intended audience of The Phantom Menace was not film makers, it was ordinary people (in contrast to say Birdman, which may be easier to appreciate if you have some insight into the dramatic world). Maybe it was meant to appeal to a younger crowd (I enjoyed it when I first saw it). Maybe it was meant to appeal to fans of the original trilogy.

My favorite:<p>&quot;Finally, the unpredictable latency of SSD-based arrays - often called all-flash arrays - is gaining mind share. The problem: if there are too many writes for an SSD to keep up with, reads have to wait for writes to complete - which can be many milliseconds. Reads taking as long as writes? That&#x27;s not the performance customers think they are buying.&quot;<p>This is completely false in a properly designed server system. Use the deadline scheduler with SSD&#x27;s so that reads aren&#x27;t starved from bulk I/O operations. This is fairly common knowledge. Also, if you&#x27;re throwing too much I/O load at any storage system, things are going to slow down. This should not be a surprise. SSD&#x27;s are sorta magical (Artur), but they&#x27;re not pure magic. They can&#x27;t fix everything.<p>While Facebook started out with Fusion-io, they very quickly transitioned to their own home-designed and home-grown flash storage. I&#x27;d be wary of using any of their facts or findings and applying them to <i>all</i> flash storage. In short, these things could just be Facebook problems because they decided to go build their own.<p>He also talks about the &quot;unpredictability of all flash arrays&quot; like the fault is 100% due to the flash. In my experience, it&#x27;s usually the RAID/proprietary controller doing something unpredictable and wonky. Sometimes the drive and controller do something dumb in concert, but it&#x27;s usually the controller.<p>EDIT: It was 2-3 years ago that flash controller designers started to focus on uniform latency and performance rather than concentrating on peak performance. You can see this in the maturation of I/O latency graphs from the various Anandtech reviews.",1450638973

Having the &quot;dynamic duo&quot; of technologically-literate lawyer and legally-literate technologist on hand can be extremely useful.<p>OTOH, if she actually wants to go into technology rather than policy-around-technology, the fast track is to build things, work with experienced teams, and read a lot.

The only place that not having one has ever caused me problems is academia, and even there it is just a political problem.<p>I&#x27;ve spent my life building, learning, and working with bright people.  Some strategy highlights:<p>* Don&#x27;t confine yourself to teams of fellow newbies.  It may feel safer for your ego, but you won&#x27;t learn as fast.<p>* Be willing to do scut work -- i.e. boring, repetitive tasks -- to endear yourself to projects you want to learn on.  Showing you will do work is the best way to demonstrate to others that it&#x27;s worth it to them to teach you.  Show up and start cleaning up documentation.  Give support on IRC.  Do issue queue triage.  Fix small bugs, then work your way up.<p>* Read.  Constantly.  Ask hackers you respect what they are reading.<p>* Try many things and figure out what your strengths are, then build on those strengths, rather than just trying for what others say is easy.<p>* If you are serious about programming, don&#x27;t just learn one programming language.  There&#x27;s a skill ceiling that (as far as I can tell) cannot be broken until one has worked in several programming languages built on different paradigms.<p>* If you are serious about infosec, don&#x27;t just spend your time around people who&#x27;ve learned to go through checklists or use tools by rote.  Find people building and analyzing from first principles, and get in with them.<p>* Find a project that needs a volunteer to do the things you want to ultimately do for pay, then volunteer.  Do an amazing job.  You&#x27;ll learn a lot (often scrambling to learn on the job), and you&#x27;ll end up with some work to show up and some good references.<p>* Spend time networking (the social kind) and use it.  Nobody knows everything.  But, if you know enough people, you probably know how to find out just about anything.

Australia, UK). I wouldn&#x27;t mind the prices of beer in a bar to be more reasonable but what can you do.<p>What&#x27;s expensive in .se is the alcohol, not the alcholic products. That makes the price of <i>some</i> cheap products very high, most notably gin/vodka etc, which carry a price that may be 3x higher than elsewhere (Worth noting of course is that even at these prices they aren&#x27;t nearly paying their own damages). That is only half the story though, products like decent wine and single malt whisky is actually very well priced, and often cheaper than in their respecive countries of origin. In the uk a crap bottle of wine is £3, in sweden twice that. A good bootle of wine in the uk is £20 and can be half that in Sweden. Prices are <i>very</i> compressed, which makes it an excellent place to be drinking decent stuff.<p>I know you were likely sort of tounge-in-cheek about the alcohol issue, but really there are lots of aspects that are way worse. \nJust take the fact that the day (if you can even call it that) in Sweden today was 5 hours long...

When the drive has been fully written, there is a lot less free space which constraints the GC and makes it works much harder. The trim tells the drive to free up space allowing for less GC work.<p>A big difference between client and enterprise drives is the amount of over-provisioning. A simple trick if you can&#x27;t use trim is to leave 5-10% of the drive unused to improve the effective over-provisioning and improve worst case performance.<p>The question of using trim in data centers might be due to interaction between trim and raid configurations because sometimes trim is implemented as nondeterministic (as a hint to the drive; persistant trim can cause performance drops unless you are willing to through in extra hardware to optimize it well) which causes parity calculation issues when recovering from a failed drive.",1450638624

On a piece of paper, write down only the five most important tasks you can think of. Then do them, in order, crossing them off as you go. (If you stop before completing one, add it again at the end.) Once the list is only two items long, add three more, to bring the total back to five. Then repeat.<p>&quot;The point of this austere approach is that you’re regularly required to ask what really needs doing, since there are only five slots. With a conventional list, there are unlimited slots – and it’s hugely tempting to plough through inessential tasks, just to cross them off.

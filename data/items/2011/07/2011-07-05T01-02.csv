2728408,comment,2727005,2728382,1,0,diogenescynic,,,"|For the USA to promise to provide logs from their worldwide wiretapping to an international war-crimes tribunal.<p>Comical. You think the USA is wiretapping all phones everywhere? How does this work? How has this massive conspiracy not been exposed?<p>You missed my point and misunderstood my question. What do you expect the US to do in Syria? We don't hold any leverage there. We're already militarily over-extended. Politically we have no appetite for another war with another Muslim country.<p>|A consistent and strong American voice presenting the facts would change everything, even if the enforcement was left to others. At least the legitimacy of the rebels would be clear and they'd be able to get support.<p>Done and done as GHFigs points out:<p>""In a statement, President Barack Obama strongly condemned ""the abhorrent violence"" committed by the Syrian government. ""I call upon the Syrian authorities to refrain from any further violence against peaceful protestors,"" said President Obama. ""Furthermore, the arbitrary arrests, detention and torture of prisoners that has been reported must end now, and the free flow of information must be permitted so that there can be independent verification of events on the ground."" <a href=""http://www.voanews.com/policy/editorials/Syrians-Call-For-Freedom-119951569.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voanews.com/policy/editorials/Syrians-Call-For-Fr...</a>",1309831100

2728406,comment,2727291,2727291,3,0,JimmyL,,,"That headline is a little sensationalist - only their web- and email-accessible clips have to be that resolution.<p>The guidelines say that ""a monitor may send to a customer who requires immediate access a video ... as an email attachment with a resolution no greater than 320 pixels by 240 pixels"", and then has a similar restriction when it comes to ""video excerpts of CBRA programs in a password-secured database"" (which, incidentally, must be removed from that database ten days after the show was broadcast). There's no restriction on the resolution of the products that the monitoring companies sell (s.6); only on how recently the clip's been aired - these companies have to get rid of their clips a month after they're broadcast.<p>Most media monitoring contracts are based around keywords and/or concepts - your contract could cover, for example, all clips on CBCNN/SunTV/CTVNN that deal with the regulation of biofuels. You'd then get a daily/weekly list of monitoring notes (a small description of what's in each clip), and from that, you could order the clips you're interested in at full resolution. If you want to do anything with these clips - like turn them into promos or send to your clients - you could then go to the rights-holders and see if they'd license them to you.<p>The clips that the headline refers to are effectively high-end versions of these monitoring notes. They're designed so that the analyst can get the gist of what's been said in the clip/see the visuals, and from that, they can make a decision about if they want to order the full-resolution product. Think of them like video thumbnails for full monitoring products.<p>The point of all these regulations is to very clearly restrict the business models of media monitoring companies. It gives them license to legally store, transmit, and distribute copyrighted content without dealing with individual broadcasters - but only enough so that customers can identify what they're interested in, and then contact the rights-holders directly for access to that content.",1309831004

If things are not in memory, they will be loaded from disk on demand, and then kept in a cache, just like virtual memory. This enables you to create persistent representations of real data structures, such as linked lists, trees, etc. You can traverse over the data, executing code in a full programming language, with your real domain model objects.<p>You simply can't work the same way once network latency is involved. This is doubly true when you get automatic generated queries, such as with an Active Record pattern.<p>Let's say that you want to traverse a linked list and apply a complex logical filter dependent on related data. You have to...<p>(A) Craft a very precise query -- This can be difficult if the query depends on business rules which you'd need to implement in both your main language and in your query language.<p>(B) Query for too much and throw away what you don't want -- In the SQL world, this is the 'OMG JOIN EVERYTHING' approach. It can work when datasets are small and infrequent, but does not scale well at all. It also requires you to do extra work upfront of declaring all the information you might possibly ever need in a particular situation.<p>(C) Query for too little and issue additional queries as you realize you need more info -- This is sort of the default for rich client libraries. Naive ORMs routinely produce N+1 nightmare perf bugs in many web applications.<p>With an embedded graph database, you just do (A) in your standard programming language, using your real domain models, without duplicating any effort, using algorithms taught to freshman year college students in their first C++ class.

The way I see it there are 3 main problems with shopping online (or shopping for clothes in general)<p>1) Sizing/Fit: A medium in brand X can be very different than brand Y. So you never end up knowing if what you're getting is actually going to fit or not until it arrives at your door.<p>2) What to get: There's a tremendous number of brands out there with different styles/patterns/cuts etc.  What's the best style that's going to accentuate your look? What cool brands are out there?  It's nearly impossible to know these things unless you devote a significant amount of time to reading up/learning fashion.<p>3) Taking the time out to buy stuff. Certainly this is better online than offline, but shopping online certainly requires a mental-tax and context-switching that I'd pretty much rather avoid.<p>We thought it would be awesome if clothes that look good and fit great just magically appeared every month and so we're trying to solve that problem with Bombfell.com.",1309828411

Have we done anything like (and this is just from memory):<p>Randomly, not as part of a campaign or anything, shelled an island.<p>Randomly torpedoed a naval vessel.<p>Brought down a civilian airliner as an act of terror.<p>Attempted to assassinate a country&#x27;s leader and take out a good fraction of his cabinet <i>with an indiscriminate bomb on foreign soil</i> (foreign to both; and this is a debatable point, we certainly hit with 2,000 pound bombs any place we thought Saddam was during the war in the last decade.  These details, including the lack of an all out hot war, are frequently used to label this act as terrorism, plus it wouldn&#x27;t have made much difference to South Korea vs. taking out someone who&#x27;d been the Maximum Leader of a country for around 3 decades).<p>In the save vein as the above, we might debate their regular landing of commandos (especially given the fairly random violence they then engage in) and perhaps their regular naval skirmishes.<p>My bottom line is that they&#x27;re <i>batshit crazy</i> in a way we simply aren&#x27;t, whatever the bottom line is in those killed and wounded.  Generally you can divine a fine grained rational cause and effect from our lethal actions, the DPRKs&#x27; only in a much broader way.",1371923974

5924520,comment,5923930,5924216,4,0,wwweston,,,"> In this environment, why would a top developer, who has their choice among tens of different high-paying interesting jobs, moonlight for a prospective new employer just so they can make sure the relationship&#x27;s going to work?<p>I have my doubts that I&#x27;m a top developer (I have a long list of things I&#x27;d like to understand/do better in order to consider myself in that category), but I&#x27;ve done and would consider doing a paid audition project.<p>The job I have right now pays market rates, offers good benefits, and involves work for famous clients. It&#x27;s not a <i>bad</i> gig, and there are enough people who&#x27;ve been there for over five years that it&#x27;s clearly a good environment for some. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t find the work itself particularly satisfying. Most of our projects themselves are a bit staid (as projects from established brand clients who feel they have more to lose than gain from risky moves can be), and a lot of what I&#x27;ve ended up doing is production front-end work rather than much problem solving.<p>This is different from the picture I got during the interviews. That could be as much about my own ability to read what day-to-day life was likely to be like post-hire as anything else, but whether it&#x27;s uniquely difficult for me or for everybody, I&#x27;m left with the same problem -- how do I get a glimpse of what working there is really going to be like?<p>Seems to me a paid audition is one good answer.<p>I&#x27;d rather do 2-3 months on contract than a 2-3 day project, but I&#x27;d rather do the 2-3 days of real work than nothing.<p>And I think the 2-3 days of real work idea beats another practice that&#x27;s becoming prevalent: the ~1 day (unpaid!) work sample/code challenge. I don&#x27;t mind such challenges in and of themselves; a small exercise can be educational and an opportunity to use all the things you&#x27;ve been thinking would be good ideas to fold into a new project. What I dislike is that real feedback seems to be scarce. Even the people who&#x27;ve <i>hired</i> me didn&#x27;t give me much feedback beyond &quot;it met the requirements and we learned a thing or two from your work.&quot; By the time I&#x27;ve invested a workday of focused time in a company, I&#x27;d appreciate a &quot;we were hoping to see&quot; or &quot;here&#x27;s what we liked&quot;, and I&#x27;m finding I don&#x27;t get much of that from challenges/exercises. Whatever the flaws of the conventional interview process or the paid real project may be, at least they&#x27;re both generally more symmetric in terms of investments required and opportunities for evaluation.",1371923840

For instance, most people are unsatisfied with the notion of abandoning their own privacy (which is a personal form of holding secrets) as a defense against government invasions of privacy, yet this is the same solution you propose that governments attempt against rival governments.",1371922934

If indeed 501(c)(4) status is allocated in a biased way, that&#x27;s functionally equivalent to government subsidies being allocated in a biased way (because a targeted tax exemption is equivalent to a targeted subsidy). This is quite different from police intimidation, surveillance and similar things: it is solely an argument over whether <i>subsidies</i> are being allocated in a viewpoint-neutral manner.<p>Controversies over whether federal subsidies are being given out in a biased way <i>are</i> important, I think, but not a novel or apocalyptic matter. Sometimes the right alleges bias (as with funding going to e.g. NPR, and climate-science funding), other times the left alleges bias (as with the bill explicitly excluding Planned Parenthood from funding, or the tax exemption given to political organizations organized as church branches). It&#x27;s worth investigating, but nobody is being shot for raising their heads.<p>Compare, say, COINTELPRO, which was not a dispute over whether  federal tax exemptions or funds were being allocated fairly, but direct state intimidation of political organizations. <i>That</i> is what I think we need to be most wary of.<p>Now, there is some contingent of raving loons who already have it in their heads that IRS=UN=jackboots=Waco=helicopters, and certain opportunists (e.g. Glenn Beck) and politicians (some Tea Party groups) like to egg them on. I am not as sure what to do about them, but I don&#x27;t think they are responding to any particular set of events based on any attempt at rational analysis of the actual events. And percentage-wise, they&#x27;re closer to 10-15%. If you ask people to agree with particularly strong interpretations of the IRS scandal, which involve paranoid fantasies of violence by jackbooted government thugs, you don&#x27;t get anywhere near 50% agreeing.<p>As for your proposed solution: I do think it&#x27;s prudent to reform the tax-exemption laws to remove subjective categories. Some subjectivity is difficult to avoid, e.g. in the definition of a 501(c)(3) charity, but clearly 501(c)(4) is one of the more problematic categories. I would support just eliminating that status entirely, rather than attempting to have the IRS determine who legitimately belongs in it vs. who doesn&#x27;t; an organization aimed at &quot;the promotion of social welfare&quot; but not necessarily a &quot;charity&quot; is just too subjective a catch-all.",1371922292

I assume bees must have some mechanism to prevent sending bees to fatal sites. For ants, no one comes back, so no one keeps going. Ant traps short-circuit this by providing food with a slow-acting poison - the ants make it back with &quot;food,&quot; causing more ants to be sent, and soon a significant portion of the stockpile is poison, drastically reducing numbers in the colony.

It was a fairly long journey to allow twin engine planes to fly the kinds of routes they are allowed today. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETOPS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETOPS</a><p>As jet engines turned out be much more reliable than their piston counterparts, the restrictions were loosened over time, starting with waiving the 60 minute rule for tri-jets in 1964. The original concept for the 777 was actually a tri-jet design. However the 767 turned out to be very reliable as a twin-engine plane and in 1985 it became the first twin engine plane to be allowed to fly 120 minutes away from a diversion airport (ETOPS-120) and in 1989 it was allowed to fly 180 minutes away from a diversion airport (but planes had to first complete 1 year with 120 minutes before they could be certified for ETOPS-180). Since twin engine designes were suddenly much more capable than anticipated Boeing dropped the tri-jet design of the 777, and eventually came back with a twin-engine design. By 1995 there was enough experience with operating twin engine planes with the 180 minute rule in place and Boeing was able to get the 777 certified to 180 minutes from the start.<p>So it basically took from 1953 to 1995 to allow a brand new twin-engine plane to fly most transoceanic routes (with a 180 minute rule in place), based on increasing evidence that the jet engines themselves are fairly safe, and learning more about additional safety mechanisms and procedures required to safely operate twin engine planes at extended distances from diversion airports.",1371920526

In the playlist, this same song is showing up every 2-3 songs -- not even remixes of the same tune, but the same original mix of the song.<p>I&#x27;m on the 2nd time around of this song, and I&#x27;ll hear it again in ~3 minutes, ~9 minutes, ~12 minutes, and ~18 minutes.<p>Edit: re-searching (searching again) seems to have cleared this up.",1371920405

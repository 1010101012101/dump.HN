174631,comment,174107,174603,0,0,hacklite,,,"> if you have opportunities now, you'll have opportunities in a few years once you graduate.<p>Sure, but not all opportunities are created equal.  Think how different things would be if Gates waited a couple years, or Woz and Jobs, or even the Google guys.  Google would have incorporated right around the dot-bust and likely would've tanked because it wouldn't have had those couple years to become established first.  If ViaWeb had waited a couple years then instead of selling to Yahoo in 1998 they would have run into the bust as well, making it that much harder to get bought.  WebTV would've missed out on two years' worth of being viable back when websites were designed for 640x480.  Microsoft would have been a couple years behind and would've missed the IBM deal.<p>In this industry, a couple of years is a <i>long</i> time and things are constantly moving, so there's always an incredible opportunity cost for waiting.<p>On the flip side, college will always be there.  Woz went back and got his degree after Apple went public.<p>> I think more people should view entrepreneurship as a career, not as something you do for a few years in your early 20s to make a few quick bucks.<p>You can do it as long as you want.  However, as an oldie, I can tell you that my productivity level was MUCH higher when I was younger.  In the 18-22 range, this stuff is EXCITING.  You've never DONE it before.  Everything motivates you!<p>I don't think it's an accident Reddit was done by guys that age.  It's such a simple site with a boring design that people with massively more experience wouldn't even <i>bother</i> to do something like it.  But they started out in Lisp, so it was an adventure!  Then they learned Python and rewrote it.  New and interesting!<p>Nothing substitutes for enthusiasm because enthusiasm leads to getting things <i>done</i>.  New things are exciting.  Youth = inexperience = more things are new and therefore exciting and so you have more enthusiasm.  Youth also means higher hormone levels, which means more energy and caring about things more and being irrational by expending irrational amounts of energy on projects that interest you.  Lower hormone levels mean indifference or just talking about something but not having the excitement level needed to break your energy-conservation threshold and DO it.",1209263649

If someone wrote a Photoshop plugin using GPL'd software and distributed it independently, Adobe would not have to GPL all of Photoshop. They <i>would</i> have to release the source code to the plugin, of course.<p>That said, if the only reason the piece of software is written as a plugin is to circumvent the GPL, you'll piss off a lot of people.

Thus, if you're only using your code privately, you should be OK. If you actually distribute your closed-source derivative work to others, then you have reused the original copyrighted source code in a manner not approved by the rightsholder's license. You are then violating someone else's copyright.<p>This applies whether you distribute your derivative code in a closed-source product, or under a non-GPL open-source license (like the MIT license).<p>(I am not a lawyer but this is pretty basic GPL interpretation.)<p><i>Edit: to clarify private use vs. 'distribution' distinction.</i>",1209261730

I think guix looks very interesting, but a couple of tips if &quot;all&quot; you need is to &quot;code on the edge&quot; in Debian:<p>1) Run Debian stable. Possibly add stuff from backports if you <i>need</i> to (eg: newer kernel for drivers. Newer xorg. Hopefully this shouldn&#x27;t ever be needed for mainstream workstations - modulus closed source graphics drivers).<p>2) Don&#x27;t mix&#x27;n&#x27;match [packages from testing/unstable with stable]. Don&#x27;t pin. Just do not do it. [Don&#x27;t run testing/unstable... unless you <i>are testing</i> testing].<p>3) For utilities not in stable - some can go in ~/opt/{bin,lib,man} -- living in ~/opt/xstow/$package-$version/ -- see &quot;man xstow/apt-get install xstow&quot; -- and set your path, ld-path, man-path (&quot;man man&quot;) and friends to point to ~/opt/man etc.<p>I also have a ~/opt/venv/util/bin in my path so I can go &quot;pip install mercurial&quot; without worrying about system python packages etc. If you go down this path be aware of &quot;apt-get build-dep mercurial|python-$foo&quot; as a reasonably sane way to get system dev headers for c libraries things you pip install in your venv(s).<p>Think of the venvs as disposable! Might have to trash them on a dist-upgrade and recreate. Ditto for ~/xstow.<p>But none of that is <i>much</i> better than the mess Wingo found himself in, therefore:<p>4) Embrace the glorious trinity formed by lvm, schroot and debootstrap! With lvm-backed schroots you can have a source-chroot for each of testing, sid/unstable and experimental. Complete with rollback, named snapshots and automagic binding of $home (with among other obvious benefits - your x session cookie).<p>Schroot documentation/wiki/howto do need a facelift, though.<p>See also:<p><a href=""https://www.pseudorandom.co.uk/2007/sbuild/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pseudorandom.co.uk/2007/sbuild/</a><p><a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/Schroot/e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.debian.org/Schroot/e</a><p><a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/CrossCompiling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.debian.org/CrossCompiling</a><p>[Note that auto-bind-mounting home can now be set in schroot.conf IIRC -- see man schroot]<p>PS: If you have $home on nfs and mount it on both 32bit/64bit linux as well as Solaris... you can put stuff in ~/opt/$arch/.. and dance around in .xsession and/or .bashrc... but I don&#x27;t recommend it unless you have to...",1438754151

Japan itself did not bother eating salmon for fear of parasites until much later.<p>To be honest, the article highlights some interesting history, but seems a bit editorialized for my tastes. As I commented there:<p>Very interesting article, but there seems to be an odd amount of time spent in adulation of Japan that I think could give an impression of less history and more &quot;rose tinted glasses.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t that long before the focused time period that Westerners were not treated so kindly in Japan.<p>&quot;And that, in microcosm, was the general attitude of 19th century Americans to both the Chinese and the Japanese; one despised, the other admired.  Over and over in newspapers and magazines of the era, the Japanese are praised as a clean, well-bred, delightful race, the “most civilizable” in Asia.  The Chinese? Not so much.&quot;<p>This seems to be laying it a bit thick on the generalizations. The Japanese weren&#x27;t exactly welcomed with open arms by everybody (and I&#x27;d love to see some citations about the implied universal hatred of the Chinese [and some more background information on why that is so wouldn&#x27;t hurt if we&#x27;re going to be throwing that in there anyway, but that too could fill its own article]). Indeed, the Japanese, too, were excluded once the &quot;yellow&quot; fear descended upon them just like the other East Asians.<p>Speaking of gyoza (which btw I think you&#x27;ve misspelled), there&#x27;s a bit of &quot;delicious&quot; irony there when considering that it very likely has Chinese origins (even when just purely considering an etymological analysis), and yet, as your article points out, from a 19th century Westerner&#x27;s view, it&#x27;s good riddance to the Chinese folks, in with the Japanese folks!",1438752520

People feel empathy for many things they shouldn&#x27;t, such as robots[1], and the feeling of empathy is not a reliable way to determine something&#x27;s moral status. Nevertheless, the natural way people make decisions on moral issues like this is to accept their emotional reaction and then rationalize their decision after the fact[2][3][4].<p>I wonder how much of the shift in public opinion on animal rights is a result of people not being exposed to farm animals anymore. The vast majority of people these days, myself included, meets only pets (and occasionally wild animals).

Randomly select two applications and show them to a partner. The partner selects the better application, or declares a tie. The Elo ratings are updated accordingly. Aggregate this over many partners and many applications, and you now have a quantifiable measure of YC&#x27;s aggregate preferences for the applications. Further, you can now calculate the probability that YC will prefer one application over the other by comparing ratings, even if the two applications have never been directly compared before.<p>Then, rank based on ratings and select the top N (N being the number they want to interview).<p>The cool thing about this is it&#x27;s very simple to implement (easily done in a day, or even a few hours).

I&#x27;ve been around long enough to recall discussions of why people should stop using CVS, and invariably one of the bullet points on that list is &quot;CVS lacks atomic commits.&quot; Projects that use multiple repositories invariably fall into the trap of having non-atomic commits, and people who advocate multiple repositories have likely never had the fun task of trying to do archaeology on those repositories where the sudden non-atomicity is suddenly painful.<p>When I&#x27;ve brought this up before, people occasionally mention submodule or subrepositories, and those are equally broken. It makes big assumptions about how you&#x27;re going to be organizing repositories (i.e., a strict tree), and if your design is not in that organization scheme, you&#x27;re up a creek. For practical development, the subrepo tree effectively becomes one monorepo anyways: touch the innermost subrepo, and now you need to add a commit to all the outer repos to update the newer version of the innermost subrepo.<p>A saner way to handle repos is to recognize that it&#x27;s not necessary for people to have the full history of everything in the repository stored on their local machine most of the time. This is something that SVN does better--you can checkout subdirectories of an SVN repo, but the commits are still atomic across the entire repository.",1438752077

We can dance around it forever, but judging by sales and in-the-wild presence of WP7, that briefly if crudely summarizes the Lumia & WP7 ecosystem to date. Doing this stupid old world stuff like distributing nail polish that matches your phone isn't distracting anyone from the increasingly untenable situation Nokia is sliding into right now. Moreover, moves like that make it seem like they're treating their situation flippantly.<p>It's not about ""hate"", it's about not candy coating things to appease certain groups. We heard for the last two years about how beautiful and fast and revolutionary WP7 is and how nice the Lumia hardware looks. Now it's time to put up or shut up and they just haven't. That's a fact, and I don't see why someone should have to ignore that and paint a happy face on the situation to not be considered a ""hack"". Moreover, I don't think you can extrapolate from that that Gruber hates Nokia, the Lumia or WP7. It's just a snarky observation.<p>If your issue is with the joke itself, I'll give you that. It wasn't all that funny or anything. I also agree he's a much better writer when in long form, and his snark does get over the top. I see where he's coming from here though.",1345006612

I actually liked it better when it was even <i>more</i> narrowly focused, back when it was mostly YC-funded companies and their friends, plus spies like myself. [1] It was probably even <i>more</i> ""boring"" then, for people who were not me: There were fewer contributors and a lot more focus on a particular subset of startups. It was even called ""Startup News"".<p>But what of it? It is not the job of any one site on the web to represent the whole world. That's what the rest of the web is for. Use that navigation bar!<p>Meanwhile, of course Twitter is exactly as diverse as you want it to be: It's much bigger, which is balanced because you control the mix of who you read. You can tweak your follower list to be fun and interesting. On the flip side, it's quite possible to tune your Twitter experience to be far narrower than HN ever has been. It's up to you.<p>As for App.net, yes, here in its earliest stages it definitely excludes people who can't afford $4.25 a month. [2] And that is too bad. Perhaps even unjust. However, dare I point out that in the USA it's pretty darned low on the list of unjust things: I literally just spent more than $4.25 in <i>one day</i> riding public transit, which suggests that Boston is, in a sense, at least 30 times more exclusive than App.net. [3] I'll reserve my supply of righteous anger for high rents, soaring medical costs, usurious check-cashing outfits, high broadband costs, and state university tuitions, I think.<p>(The biggest injustice of a $4.25 monthly fee is that it excludes people from places where US$4.25 is a lot of money. Here we must hold out hope that prices will fall over time. Which they almost certainly can do: It takes more money to invent a thing than to run it at scale.)<p>---<p>[1] Flaw Number One of the ""country club"" analogy is that country clubs don't publish their internal discussions to globe-spanning message boards where anyone can read them, including those of us who aren't yet computer scientists and don't have YC startups.<p>[2] Flaw Number Two of the ""country club"" analogy is that country clubs are considered snobbish not merely because they cost a lot, but because you can't necessarily join one simply by paying the fee. They reserve the right not to admit you even if you pay. AFAIK App.net does not, although presumably they'll boot you for policy violations.<p>[3] Oh, you think you'll save money by driving? Have you priced the parking in Boston lately? Calculated the per-mile cost of operating your car?",1345006456

4384630,comment,4384113,4384361,1,0,brc,,,"Insurance companies make money by investing the premium in investments.  A correctly balanced insurance book will match premiums + claims over an expected time period.  The idea is to invest the premium and make money off the investments.  This is why Warren Buffet buys insurance companies, because he is a good investor.<p>If an insurance company is paying out more in claims than they are taking in in premium, that is when they will increase the premiums.  If they are taking in more premium than they are paying in claims, they will generally identify areas where this is the case, and lower premiums to attract more customers.<p>There is a lot of ignorance about insurance companies on this thread.  There is also a lot of ignorance that self-driving cars will require no insurance.  Not all of the cost of insurance goes to insuring the driver hitting something.  There are fire, theft and third party property + injury components.  None of these will be removed, though some may be reduced over time in line with claims being lower.<p>Most of the extra cost of insurance in a large city has to do with the theft component (especially if not garaged).  People who live in rural areas pay much less insurance than those in city areas, principally due to decreased theft rates.  Autonomous cars will be stolen just like regular cars.",1345005985

My grandfather (93 years old) is also a daily laptop linux user. When he presses that power button, that laptop better be booted and ready /yesterday/. And when he pushes it again, it better be off before he closes the lid. Slow startup and shutdown times are simply not an acceptable user experience; they are literally the difference between enjoying and wanting to use the computer, and not wanting to bother with it.<p>And don't think for a minute he's going to learn about suspend, hibernate, power savings, battery life, or whatever. It's just not going to happen. His laptop lives in the closet, so it's going to be off (either by his doing, or the battery running out). When he sees something on tv and wants to read about it, he takes the laptop out, plugs it in, and turns it on.

You don't need to trust me (IANAL, etc.), but based on my experience in the field -- I co-founded HireWinston (initially a Canadian, corporate-focused Uber competitor; we've since pivoted to competing indirectly by selling taxi fleets) -- I hope I have something to add.<p>First, the relationships with drivers: Uber tends to work directly with drivers (many, if not all, of whom they hire legally from existing livery services). In order to boost their chances of availability, they spend some of their hard-raised cash to book drivers for entire days, taking a steep loss at first in the hopes of driving enough demand to better satisfy their capacity.<p>In most cities, there are clear regulations that define a livery service. We found that, if you work as many commenters understand Uber working -- namely, as a network that has pre-arranged agreements with drivers or livery services to shuttle rides in their spare time -- you're in a sufficiently comfortable area not to get shut down. However, the way Uber works to juice supply (especially in newer markets) tends to clearly fall under the definition of a livery service, as they have their own ""employees"" that they pass rides to.<p>Second, the meters. This one I'm much more in their favour on: the phones themselves are not metering devices as the laws define them (i.e. they do not themselves calculate the price). I haven't personally torn into their source code, but having heard from an insider <i>and</i> having built this tech myself, I'm fairly confident their Driver App simply sends GPS data back to the server, where the calculation takes place according to a pre-defined rate. The customer either implicitly or explicitly accepts this rate through the TOS and/or by virtue of using the service (assuming the rates are published somewhere).<p>This setup guarantees they have something to show regulators if ever asked. From our research and testing, the integrity of the data from existing metering technology is similar enough to that from an iPhone or Android's GPS (ideally accompanied by accelerometer data). And, since the calculations happen on a server that records full route information rather than in a black box that discards it: way easier to share this with regulators. So A+.<p>Third, and most importantly, is what you don't see: Uber's relationships with city regulators. In Toronto, the municipal government sent us an official notice that they were concerned with our business, and that they wanted us to come talk through our business model and underlying technology with them. They were genuinely excited that there was innovation happening in the field in their city, and really just wanted to make sure we weren't doing anything egregiously wrong.<p>We sat down, and had an incredibly pleasant meeting. 30 minutes, back-and-forth Q&A, with some regulators who have spent years in the space. They appreciated that we knew the laws, had worked to abide by them, and were comfortable with all but one aspect of our business model (cancellation fees). No C&Ds were sent out.<p>At the end of the meeting, they asked us what we thought of Uber. Apparently, for months, the Uber team was dodging any request for a meeting the office sent them. While I definitely cannot attest to Uber Boston's actions on this front, I can't imagine that Uber Toronto was taking their plays from a different playbook.<p>In summary: Uber has done a tremendous job pushing the industry forward, and I'm confident that our approach -- selling the underlying software to existing taxi fleets, who truly want to better service their customers but have no idea what to do with technology -- is a more sustainable and dependable iteration on the model. I'm thankful to them, and I truly love a lot of the folks I know who work there.<p>That said, I have no sympathy whatsoever for these C&Ds whenever I read about them. The company relies on deep pockets and public sympathy for the ""underdog technology company"" to change laws, rather than working with the existing system. And, frankly, normally I'd even be fine with that... if it weren't the taxi drivers -- the most marginalized members of the entire taxi ecosystem -- who were getting the shortest end of the stick.<p><i></i> DISCLAIMER: I do not, and have never, worked for Uber. Most of my knowledge comes from a mix of an outsider's view and third-party testimony of the approach that Uber has taken in Toronto and NYC. I'm not sure if Uber Boston took a different approach than Uber Toronto or Uber NYC, so take all specifics with a grain of salt. <i></i><p>(edit: formatting errors)",1345005227

Love the phrase ""Information Technology not Technology Technology"".<p>But I do think he has been a bit unfair to databases (and primary keys) generally, in characterizing them as ""place oriented"".   The relational model is actually a brilliantly successful example of a value-oriented information technology.<p>The very foundation of the relational model is the information principle, in which the only way information is encoded is as tuples of attribute values.<p>As a consequence, the relational model provides a technology that is imbued with all of the the virtues of values he discusses.  \n * language independence \n * values can be shared\n * don't need methods\n * can send values without code\n * are semantically transparent\n * composition, etc.<p>It's true that we can think of the database itself as a place, but that's a consequence of having a shared data bank in which we try to settle a representation of what we believe to be true.    Isolation gives the <i>perception</i> of a particular value.    In some ways, this is just like a CDN ""origin"".<p>Also regarding using primary key as ""place"".   Because capturing the information model is the primary task in designing a relational database schema, the designer wants to be fairly ruthless by discarding information that's not pertinent.  For example, in recording student attendance, we don't record the name of the attending student - just their ID.   This is not bad.   We just decided that in the case of a name change, it's not important to know the name of the student as at the time of their attendance.

Milkman<p>Results from the first study reveals that controversy significantly affects likelihood of discussion. The second study comes to a similar conclusion but fleshes it out a little more eloquently:<p>""Importantly, however, our findings also reveal that virality is driven by more than just valence. Sadness, anger, and anxiety are all negative emotions, but while sadder content is less viral, content that evokes more anxiety or anger is actually more viral. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis about how arousal shapes social transmission. Positive and negative emotions characterized by activation or arousal (i.e., awe, anxiety, and anger) are positively linked to virality, while emotions characterized by deactivation (i.e., sadness) are negatively linked to virality. More broadly, our results suggest that while external drivers of attention (e.g., being prominently featured) shape what becomes viral, content characteristics are of similar importance (see Figure 2). For example, a one-standard deviation increase in the amount of anger an article evokes increases the odds that it will make the most e-mailed list by 34% (Table 4, Model 4). This increase is equivalent to spending an additional 2.9 hours as the lead story on the New York Times website""<p>Apple is well known for controversy and Gruber is known for his snark (though I found this article to be insightful speculation) - the two seem to really complement each other and a lot of their success comes down to their behaviour.

You can probably find a thing or two to disagree with, but like he says, this is something we all know to be true.</i><p>I agree very much with the underlying theme of the talk. But changing the focus to working with immutable values is only one step in a direction away from the dominant, imperative style of programming typified by OOP. There are (at least) two more big steps that need to be taken before I can see this more functional style of programming having any chance of going mainstream.<p>Firstly, we have to deal with the time dimension. The real world <i>is</i> stateful. All useful programs interact with other parts of the world in some form, and the timing of those interactions is often important. While programming with pure functions has advantages and lends itself very well to expressing some ideas, sooner or later we have to model time. There are plenty of relevant ideas with potential, but I dont think were anywhere near getting this right yet.<p>Secondly, there are some algorithms that you simply cant implement efficiently without in-place modification of data. If programs are to be expressed in a way that pretends this doesnt happen, then the compilers and interpreters and VMs need to be capable of optimising the implementation to do it behind the scenes. At best, this is a sufficiently smart compiler argument, and even as those optimisations develop, I suspect that programmers will still have to understand the implications of what they are doing at a higher level to some extent so that they can avoid backing the optimiser into a corner.<p>We know from research into program comprehension that as we work on code were simultaneously forming several different mental models of that code. One of these is what we might call control flow, the order of evaluating expressions and executing statements. Another is data flow, where values come from and how they are used. Often the data flow is what we really care about, but imperative code tends to mix these two different views together and to emphasize control flow even when its merely an implementation detail. Moving to a more functional, value-based programming style is surely a step in the right direction, since it helps us understand the data flow without getting lost in irrelevant details.<p>To really get somewhere, though, I suspect well need to move up another level. Id like to be able to treat causes and effects (when a program interacts with the world around it or an explicitly stateful component) as first class concepts, because ultimately modelling of time matters exactly to the extent that it constrains those causes and effects. Within that framework, everything else can be timeless, at least in principle, and all those lovely functional programming tools can be applied.<p>Sometimes, for efficiency, I suspect well still want to introduce internal concepts of time/state, but Im hoping that however we come to model these ideas will let us keep such code safely isolated so it can still have controlled, timeless interactions with the rest of the program. In other words, I think we need to be able to isolate time not only at the outside edge of our program but also around the edge of any internal pieces where stateful programming remains the most useful way to solve a particular problem but that state is just an implementation detail.<p>So, I agree with you that this idea is about much more than just programming with immutable values. But I dont think we can ever do away with a time dimension (or, if you prefer, place-oriented programming) completely. Rather, we need to learn to model interactions using both external time and internal time with the same kind of precision that modern type systems have for modelling relationships between data types. And whatever model we come up with had better not rely on scary words like monad, at least not to the general programming population rather than the guys designing programming languages. In fact, ironically (or not), it starts to sound a lot like the original ideas behind OOP in some respects. :-)",1345004306

But the writer in me loved the limitations each had, since limitations often leads to creativity.<p>So I'm excited about what Medium could be. Looking at their examples, my guess is they're mashing together elements of Pinterest and Tumblr (and Svbtle). Perhaps they see power in making publishing more visual and flexible. A visually-appealing layout invites a reader in. And there are all kinds of writers - or better - content creators. Some are visual (hence the all-image collections), some are textual, some are a mix of both. Perhaps in the future, they'll offer video and audio too. Well, maybe not audio ;) (cough cough Odeo cough)<p>Will it work? I think they've got something interesting here, though I don't see a leap that's as revolutionary as Blogger or Twitter yet.<p>As a content creator, my main concerns are:<p>+ <i>Is it easy to create?</i> (This is perhaps the biggest concern)<p>+ <i>Can I express myself in the form I want to?</i> (In whatever format I prefer)<p>+ <i>Can I be creative in my expression?</i> (Sometimes limitations are good here)<p>+ <i>Will I have an audience?</i> (The follower system seems to work well here, as well as ways to share to other social media networks)<p>+ <i>Can I hear from my audience?</i> (Comments, likes, votes, ratings, etc; moderation and filtering is key here)<p>+ <i>How can my ego be fed?</i> (Creators may not think about this consciously, but all public creators care about their reputation, be it through audience engagement, social media metrics, etc)<p>Blogger, Twitter, and other social media creation tools offer these to some extent. I think part of Blogger and Twitter's success was how they enabled the first bullet point: they made creating content easy. Ridiculously easy.<p>The examples Medium offered only show off the final products, so I don't know anything about the creation process. Will it be ridiculously easy to use, easier than Blogger, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, etc? It looks very interesting, but I don't get a feeling of it being revolutionary. At least, not yet.",1345003954

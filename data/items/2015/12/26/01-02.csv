Pretty tough to do as a kid, unless you&#x27;re free to roam free all over town to gather a crew, which approximately 0% of kids have license/protection from CPS to do.<p>2.)  You need a big enough area for a baseball diamond, where you don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking out a window with a foul ball or an errant throw.  Mostly, you aren&#x27;t allowed to use the actual baseball fields to just play pickup.  Compare with soccer or football, where any old open area is good enough, or basketball, which needs a hoop but probably takes the least space.<p>3.) Everybody needs at least a baseball glove.

You could say that Microsoft made a clone of the languages for microcomputers, but did not invent the languages themselves. This cut down on research and design costs to use an existing language and write a clone of it instead of paying a license fee for the language software and port that.<p>So at the time the people who pirated Micro-soft tapes and floppies claimed that it was an illegal port in the first place. I don&#x27;t know if they are correct or not but copyright was not enforced in the 1970s and 1980s because they had different IP laws then than we do now.<p>When Microsoft bought 86-DOS/Q-DOS it had violated CP/M-86 patents by using the API and in fact there was a CP/M to DOS converter for programs because of how similar both operating systems were. <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2012/08/ms-dos-examined-for-thef/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2012/08/ms-dos-examined-for-thef/</a> But as it turns out you can&#x27;t copyright an API and Linux uses the Unix API.<p>So saying Microsoft stole IP is very hard to say, they did develop alternatives to the originals that their software did the same things as. None of what they made early on they sold was original and was based on something else.<p>The only reason why IBM chose DOS instead of CP/M is that DOS cost less per license than CP/M. Plus IBM got access to Microsoft BASIC for their PC ROM.<p>Micro-Soft saw a need for a programming language for many microcomputers that didn&#x27;t even have software yet, it allowed others to use the languages to write software for the many different microcomputers. So in a way Microsoft making their own version of those languages without paying a license fee opened up a lot of doors for the 8 bit and 16 bit market. Because no other company was doing that at that time.<p>To this day many free and open source projects make clones of the original products by using the same API as the original and writing their own code from scratch. If API becomes copyrighted it would shut those projects down.<p>The IBM PC Clone market only happened because they cloned the PC BIOS by reverse engineering it and writing their own BIOS that uses the same API calls as IBM&#x27;s BIOS. Then Microsoft licensed MS-DOS to the PC clone companies who made PCs cheaper than IBM and lead to a reduction in cost of microcomputers.<p>So in honesty Microsoft sort of started the API cloning business and it allowed the PC Cloners to take over IBM&#x27;s marketshare and drive IBM out of the PC business.",1451094098

What you just said is why this sort of think makes my fucking blood boil (no anger at you friend, it&#x27;s with the institution manipulating you).<p>What they are trying to do, and this really pisses me off, is rebrand &quot;internet&quot; to &quot;Facebook,&quot; for poor Indians. A group who as of right now is unaware of the difference and less apt to understand the evils of the marketing engine behind it because they are not yet connected.<p>Tangent: they are making this so much worse by using government built spectrum. What the fuck kind of perverse asshole thought that would be okay?<p>... Back to the point.<p>Think about this, from an infrastructure standpoint: it will cost them more in firewalls and configuration to limit the Internet than to simply allow unfettered access.<p>I&#x27;m not even kidding, they are going to spend more money implementing basic access than by just giving out plain ol&#x27; Internet. Knowing that, I find it pretty fucking audacious Facebook thinks we are all so fucking stupid to accept that line of shit.<p>Okay... they know we won&#x27;t but we don&#x27;t matter to their growth target.

Then back home they market their &quot;humanitarian&quot; efforts making for some touching PR moments.<p>/slow-clap &quot;nice work, assholes.&quot;<p>And finally for how this is actually worse than &quot;no Facebook at all,&quot; is because FB&#x27;s marketing machine will go around saying to governments and media &quot;don&#x27;t worry about India&#x27;s Internet, we fixed it.&quot; This, I promise, will slow the development, if not halt it, because other organizations non-profit or for-profit will think it&#x27;s a done deal.

There&#x27;s a lot of questions to be asked about what the objectives of the project are, executive backing, and (most importantly) how strong the funding is to demonstrate the worth. As an example, my customer has made huge investments in attempts to hire developers while skimping tremendously on dependent efforts that would remove barriers for those developers to the extent that most developers are doing 9-5 jobs and unable to accomplish a lot while a lot of the infrastructure teams are working 12+ hour days working on very much solved problems from decades ago that only exist due to lack of respect and understanding of basic automation principles required to scale software companies of any sort. Everyone wants to work on modern, relevant problems - make sure that people are specific about their current barriers as being technical rather than organizational as a prospective employee.<p>Look for a deep culture of respected and accomplished leaders in software up and down the hierarchy. If nobody in a position of authority has delivered software successfully before that you can recognize as an engineer, pass because culture and experience among executives is massively important and their priorities should focus on long term growth (Amazon was ridiculed by enterprise vendors while I screamed that they will eat their business in a decade - they don&#x27;t care because they&#x27;ll go somewhere else while I have to deal with the very expensive consequences of bad software). There are too many great companies around today to waste time on mediocre companies - it is better to be jobless for months or years waiting for a great company to accept you for your talents than to waste some of the best years on companies where your best efforts will result in second rate winnings. It&#x27;s a huge risk to work for mediocre companies that will not put the work you will have to put in themselves.<p>My e-mail is djk29a on Google&#x27;s e-mail service. Not sure how the first part of your e-mail works out and I&#x27;m several days late so hopefully this is relevant advice.",1451091875

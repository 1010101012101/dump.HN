It has existed on this planet for a long time, and has endured much worse shocks than Monsanto can produce. In the long run biologists will simply see the contributions of intelligent life as another source of genetic variability. That isn't to say that humans always have good ideas about genetic changes: consider the dachshund. Only planetary-scale events have the potential to really screw things up for life per se.<p>I think we can agree that as harmful non-inherited transmissible genetic variation goes, the terminator gene (if it actually works; do we really know why Monsanto didn't buy Delta & Pine?) is probably the least worrisome. A gene that acts against reproductive fitness is not one that will ever be common in nature. As for other variations, patented or not, I expect most will be out-competed outside carefully controlled environments. Few domestic chickens live long in a predator-rich environment. Roundup tolerance itself is unlikely to enhance fitness in the absence of someone willing to pay Monsanto thousands of dollars every year. Those few human-created variations that can establish themselves in wild populations, if we ever discover such, I'm just going to call evolution. The spectre of the super-weed seems silly to me: the essence of a weed is that, in the absence of human intervention, it crowds out plants that humans like. Roundup is only agriculturally valuable for cultivation of varieties that tolerate Roundup; if weeds gained that tolerance it wouldn't be a net loss for humanity.",1360615774

Any half-experienced Erlang developer can tell you that you use `list_to_existing_atom' rather than `list_to_atom' if you are ever doing dynamic things with atoms. So, if you're trying to accomplish dynamic module lookup and foo_baz.beam is in your code path, default startup will create the `foo_baz' atom, and you know that this atom will exist at runtime.<p>Symbols in Ruby are atoms (the term ""atom"" spans languages), and GC/space issues plague any persistent term like an atom, in any language.<p>And thus I arrive at a key question: Does Ruby have something like `list_to_existing_atom', or some mechanism for telling if a symbol exists already? I see no analog to this, only the `ID2SYM' macro in the extensions API, and similar calls like String#to_sym.<p>Perhaps there is some way to clean up symbols after they are created. This to me would seem like the ideal route. It's good they've got a stop-gap fix by changing defaults, but it feels to me like they're punting here. Perhaps users who do [ab]use this feature also would not like DOS attacks?<p>I hope others who know more about Ruby extension development, and symbol management capabilities, can chime in on these questions.",1360615768

That being said, I'd still like to get it to the full number of signatures, even if it doesn't deal with all the issues involved. In the very least, it shows that the public care about these sorts of policy decisions.<p>At this point, having been working on this in various forms (via writing, or promoting this petition), I'm now quite eager to figure out exactly what needs to change with the DMCA and to help promote a movement to change the law in a more meaningful way.

I'll give two examples.<p>Any grid-based CSS framework breaks content/layout separation - one of the best features of HTML5/CSS. Instead of naming elements based on document role, they are labelled by row and column position. After the prototype was finished, the designer wanted to add a banner at the top of the page. With normal CSS/HTML this would have been an insignificant change, but because we were using a grid, all HTML had to be rewritten because row 1 now equaled row 2, etc.<p>#2, The CSS in Bootstrap changes the global defaults of all HTML attributes. I have probably written as much CSS to undo bootstrap styles than to add new. I hope you like writing ""line-height: normal"" over and over again.<p>I could conclude saying that bootstrap should only be used to build prototypes, then throw it all away before developing the production app, but I don't know why you need fancy formatting in a prototype app. I'd recommend you build the first version in black-and-while/wireframe style, then hire a professional designer for the final decoration.

I understand the urge to whitelist, but lets be reasonable here.<p>If i have a table with 20 columns, 19 of which i want accessible (lets exclude a private UK).

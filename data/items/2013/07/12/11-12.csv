6032117,comment,6028326,6028923,1,0,wikiburner,,,"I&#x27;ve often wondered if a balloon-based system might be the way that this is eventually achieved. As solar energy becomes more and more efficient every year (apparently it&#x27;s on an expotential price/performance growth curve), you coat the balloon with a light-weight, flexible solar array, and either heat the air like a hot air balloon, or as it becomes cheaper and more efficient to extract hydrogen from water, fill the balloon with hydrogen, and constantly replace the hydrogen that leaks out with hydrogen extracted from water vapor in the air:\n<a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/view/512996/a-cheaper-way-to-make-hydrogen-from-water/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/view/512996/a-cheaper-way-to...</a><p>You could use low powered propellers (like a blimp), and take advantage of weather patterns (like Google&#x27;s Loon project) in order to maintain position or to slowly travel.",1373630377

[0] What difference does it make if they&#x27;re spread out all over the globe or not, whether you can email or FB them?<p>I do get the idea, sometimes I feel a little bit excluded without an FB account, but I have never had the problem that somebody didn&#x27;t have an <i>email</i> address. Not even kids.<p>People seem to make up all sorts of excuses, but in the end it always boils down to 1) suffering minor inconveniences and 2) the (often[1] irrational) fear of social exile.<p>As other people have pointed out, <i>changing networks is not that hard</i>. It&#x27;s a false belief that it is. Years ago my local friends were mostly on MSN[2], East European/Middle East folks were on ICQ and Y!C, US people were using AIM. So I used Trillian and later Pidgin. What you saw was this, people are moving around all the time, and many of the persons were 2 or 3x in my contact list because they too were on multiple networks. Google chat just sort of edged itself in there as well.<p>Think of it like this, remember how easy it was to find all your friends on FB because of that network? And didn&#x27;t the same happen with email, and with AIM/MSN/iCQ/etc? I see friends and acquaintances trickle in on G+ without any effort for that reason (except I don&#x27;t want to use G+ either). Now FB pushes its &quot;help&quot; quite aggressively, but even without that, people connect in networks, point eachother to their friends, it&#x27;s <i>very</i> peer-to-peer :)<p>[0] I mean, it happens ... <a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html</a><p>[1] note I&#x27;m not saying &quot;always&quot;, I can imagine certain high school scenarios where this fear might be somewhat real, although one has to wonder ...<p>[2] unfortunately I lost my MSN acct because the not-hotmail domain I registered it to expired a long long time ago and it stopped working--if anyone knows a solution to that I&#x27;d love to hear it because I would love to see that old contact list back :) (<i>however</i> I could also reg a new account and repopulate my contacts via-via just as easy)",1373630018

I was being intentionally vague on the implementation and you assumed that current political forces turn it into a poverty trap.  But current political forces also prevent an unconditional basic income.<p>It really comes down to how much you trust people to find their own path.<p>That clearly depends on how old they are.  Below 18, you are required to be in school and you are not allowed to work.  After 65, you get to live off our national pension plan and get free health care.<p>The other thing that makes me cautious about the unconditional income approach is the handful of rich kids that I knew in High School in Austin, TX.  They had everything they could possible want handed to them and were miserable.  It was puzzling as hell.<p>FDR had a really big internal debate over this during the Great Depression.

6032091,comment,6030806,6031801,9,0,dalke,,,"What makes it clear that something is a real threat?<p>If there&#x27;s lack of motive, lack of planning, and lack of weapons, then is it a threat? Everything about this case says that there was no evidence that it was real, and that all exculpatory evidence (eg, the context this was smack talk, and the &quot;j/k&quot; and &quot;lol&quot; disclaimer) were removed from the evidence presented to the judge.<p>You say that unusual expressions are more deserving of investigation, and should have a lower threshold than &#x27;normal&#x27; phrases like &quot;I&#x27;m so angry with you that I could to kill you.&quot; However, in the context, the person accused had just been insulted by being called &quot;crazy&quot;, and the response seems to have a riff on what &quot;crazy&quot; might really mean, quickly followed by the disclaimers.<p>Where is the actual threat? I don&#x27;t see how this teenager is a real threat, just like you don&#x27;t see how those other cases are real threats.<p>For that matter, and from what I understand, the person who reported the message is from Canada. Canada has a different cultural expectation of what free speech means than the US. If it takes a single report to make the sort of complaint about &quot;unusual speech&quot;, do we need to accept anyone&#x27;s standard threshold anywhere in the world?<p>If a DC police officer, who sometimes works as a motorcycle escort for the First Lady, can jokingly say that he want to kill her, and purportedly shows another officer a picture of the weapon he will use to do so, then surely that&#x27;s a much more serious threat, with specific access and ability. Yet, that officer wasn&#x27;t charged with a crime, nor sent to prison with a high bond. As I understand, he had desk duty while the investigation occurred.<p>Why is this case with the teenager so deserving of a disproportionately high bond, compared to other threats which are seemingly more credible?<p>Recently in Oklahoma, &quot;A Norman man threatened via email to kill Gov. Mary Fallin&#x27;s child and McClain County Sheriff Don Hewitt, apparently because he is upset about the death of his own child.&quot; &quot;Helling, who told investigators he sent the emails from the Norman Public Library, was arrested June 7 on unrelated warrants and booked into the Cleveland County jail. His bail has been set at $20,000, records show.&quot;<p>Last year in Utah, &quot;A Utah man who police say threatened to assassinate Gov. Gary Herbert is now facing multiple felony charges.&quot; &quot;The 52-year-old Baker is being held in the Salt Lake County jail. Bail is set at $25,007.&quot;<p>So we have people who have specifically threatened to kill a governor (and in one case the governor&#x27;s (grown) child), and had a bail of only $25,000 or so.<p>Why is this teenager&#x27;s case so extreme so as to require a bail of $500,000?<p>I&#x27;ve searched, but couldn&#x27;t find a similar case with a bail that was this high. The closest I found was from a few years ago: &quot;A Philadelphia man was charged with telephoning death threats into 911 against Mayor Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Kelly, authorities said Monday.&quot; &quot;Fisher is being held on $100,000 bail after his arraignment Saturday in Manhattan Criminal Court on 10 counts of making a terroristic threat, authorities said.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve instead found things like earlier this week, where &quot;An Owatonna man faces felony charges after he allegedly threatened to kill a man while waving a baseball bat. Andrew John Kramer, 24, was charged with second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon and making a terroristic threat in Steele County District Court on Monday morning. ... Because of his criminal history and the possible public safety risk, Judge Joseph Bueltel set Kramers outright bail at $30,000 and his conditional bail at $15,000.&quot;<p>Do you seriously believe that these cases of direct threats against specific people, including threatening to use a baseball bat, is less serious, and less deserving of high bail, than what the teenager did?<p>Why?",1373629784

One of the first steps in installing a new Linux system on Nvidia hardware is usually to remove, purge and blacklist Nouveau, and install the closed driver, because that just works (tm). I&#x27;d even use software rendering over llvmpipe before I&#x27;d consider Nouveau.<p>If the future of the Linux desktop on Nvidia hardware requires a reverse-engineered GPU driver that lacks all the features provided by the closed-source driver, we can postpone the &#x27;year of the Linux desktop&#x27; for at least another decade.",1373628576

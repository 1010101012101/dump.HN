4646368,comment,4644963,4645585,1,0,awolf,,,"Great comment, thanks for making it. There's nothing like having a domain expert explain the tradeoffs using specifics.<p>A while back I wrote a reusable class that draws a single button using <i>three</i> overlapping CAGradientLayers each .5 pixels larger than the next layer drawn on top of it. With this arrangement I can then specify top and bottom values for the ""outer gradient"", ""inner gradient"" and ""body gradient"" producing beautiful buttons that are 100% adjustable in code. Since 80% of my skills lie in the development realm vs. the design realm this class has been insanely useful for me across multiple projects.<p>But obviously not efficient. If I wanted to refactor my class to still have the three levels of run-time rendered gradients along with rounded corners,  what would be the most efficient method?",1350068239

4646366,comment,4644230,4644613,1,0,rayiner,,,"Here is what I don't get about your argument. You're using one theory of social conditioning to explain why women stay away from CS (the social status of the field), while implicitly rejecting the more obvious bit of social conditioning: the perception that engineering is for socially maladjusted men.<p>And neither provides a principled reason to maintain the status quo. Why should the socially maladjusted men already in engineering (as you call them) get to define the culture of the field?<p>What if tech companies tried to actively change the culture of the field. What if, say for 15 years, tech companies put a thumb on the scale by actively trying to recruit say 25% women. You'd definitely have to take slightly less qualified candidates in order to meet the quota, but it would be transient. After 15 years, there would be a critical mass of women in the field, and the perception of the field as being for socially maladjusted men would be greatly diminished. Tech companies would have enough women applicants to maintain their new ratios without putting a thumb on the scale. You can say it's ""unfair"" to the men who would have gotten those jobs in the interim, but is it any more ""fair"" for a group to keep another group out of a lucrative profession by defining a particular culture?",1350068164

I apologize if this is frowned upon at HN.<p>In Soto Zen Buddhism, the point isn't necessarily to ""quiet the mind,"" because that implies that the running rivers of thoughts somehow dry up and give rise to a silent stillness. This may be the goal of some forms of meditation, but it is not the interpretation of Zen.<p>Dogen Zenji preferred to use the term shikantaza, which means something like ""nothing but to hit sit,"" or less literally, ""just sitting."" The understanding is that rejecting thoughts is the other side of the coin of embracing thoughts: both are rooted in attachment to the thought, identification of the thought with the illusion of self or ego.<p>The ""purpose"" of shikantaza, also known as zazen (sitting meditation), is to neither accept nor reject thoughts. Thus the mind isn't necessarily becoming ""quiet,"" but rather the process of self-aggrandizement is discontinued.<p>It might seem like I'm nitpicking over your word choice, but Zen in particular is a school that is very focused on how language itself is rooted in the concept of ""I"" and our ego. You can contrast shikantaza to other forms of meditation that utilize a particular focus, such as an image, which is something that Zen would not generally endorse (for you would simply be displacing grasping at one thing with another thing).<p>Shikantaza is tied to ""thusness,"" or being fully in the moment, which webwanderings above explains quite well.",1350068033

4646310,comment,4646006,4646006,2,0,platypii,,,"While I believe the author is not wrong in his argument that information theory is a bound on machine intellignce, I think the problem with using information theoretic bounds is that it is not a tight bound. In other words, I don't think information theory is currently the limiting factor.<p>The author argues that any AI will consist of two parts, the machine learning program L and the training set T, which combine to form the ""intelligent"" program M. And thus by information theory, k(L) + k(T) >= k(M) [where k is the kolmogorov complexity]. Thus M is bounded by the information in L and also bounded by T. The author argues that since these both depend on humans supplying them, we are limited by the human factor.<p>But how much information does one really need for AI? Well, how much information is necessary for human intelligence? Assuming that L is our genome (ignoring epigenetics), and T is our life experiences. The amount of data in our genome is on the order of around 3gb. I would argue that's certainly within the realm of feasibility for programmer's output. How about the training set T? That's harder to say; does it include video, audio, touch, etc? How many years until a human is considered intelligent (by AI standards)? I think it's safe to say that a 10 year old blind human could pass a Turing test. So if we ignore tactile and olfactory feedback, we basically just need 10 years of compressed audio as the training set. Generously encoding the audio at 128kbps 24/7 for 10 years = 4.7 terabytes.

Martin Gardner's October 1970 column in SciAm introduced me to cellular automata, and I spent a few hours meticulously tracking generations on a checkerboard before it occurred to me that the university's IBM 1130 was probably better than I was at that sort of thing.  Soon friends and I were writing competing Fortran programs for that 1130, monopolizing it all night every night, calculating Life.<p>I corresponded with Gardner once or twice, and subscribed to Robert T. Wainwright's <i>Lifeline</i> newsletter, which had begun a taxonomy of Life objects and reported community progress.  Our little group was surprisingly competitive in the beginning, considering the limited resources at our backwater university, but when the MIT group kicked into high gear the exploits of Gosper, Woods and others at MIT were simply mind blowing.  Woods' Atavist backtracker, Gosper's Glider Gun, the first discovery of a Garden-of-Eden configuration... who could compete with <i>that</i>?  And Gosper continued to amaze with his astonishing Breeder.<p>Conway's GoL inspired other acquaintances, electrical engineers.  One of them built a special-purpose computer to compute generations; he'd have surprised to know then that the computer was Turing-complete.  Another EE pal built a crude raster display for the lab's Nova 1220 mini, with the specific intent to display GoL generations.  Hardly such a thing as glass TTYs in those days, kids.<p>Sorry for the free-association; you know how old guys get.

When human reproductive choices were far more limited (because travel was limited, total number of human interactions were limited, technology spread/scaling was limited, etc) then the anti-social (a-social? under-social?)

In addition, at previous levels of technology access to information/tools essentially <i>required</i> interaction with other human beings (to a far larger degree than with current technology).<p>The modern world -- with everything from antibiotics to automobiles & jet airplanes -- has led to humans having wider circles, to the greater marginalization of Aspie types; and recent technology (especially the internet) has facilitated a self-withdrawal of more and more Aspies; such that more and more of them are likely to be genetic dead-ends.<p>Ergo the chances of Aspies reaching some ""critical mass"" is not only highly unlikely, it is improbable.",1350066831

> Not typical of any BSD sysadmin I've known, ever. OTOH if your ""BSD users"" were not sysadmins that would explain it.<p>Professional sysadmins - but obviously more conservative than ones you know. That was the base install, a ton of ports and mucking around getting video drivers, etc. installed. This is for a fully-configured scientific workstation, not just a bare OS install, so there were a couple hundred packages installed by the time you include all of the various dependencies.<p>I'm certain that binary packages would have shaved a lot of time off of this (that's what I used to use on OpenBSD a decade ago) but that wasn't exactly strongly recommended at the time, which is why I mentioned culture  I'm certain you can manage FreeBSD better but in practice I have yet to meet anyone in person who actually does this. Small sample size and all but this is untrue of any Linux user I've met other than the Gentoo fanatics who consider tweaking CFLAGS a source of entertainment.<p>> A) the ports system works across _all_ versions and architectures i.e., you don't have to upgrade the entire OS simply to upgrade say mysql to 5.5, B) OS upgrades break far fewer apps in BSD than any version of Linux,<p>A) is comically untrue: not only can you easily compile newer packages but extensive backports repositories exist to make it easy and safe to install a new version of something important while keeping the rest of the system stable. For many distributions this exists as a vendor-provided service and there are others (e.g. IUSCommunity.org) which serve particular markets and a fair number of OSS projects maintain repos for the Debian & Red Hat worlds.<p>B) may be true in your experience but it's radically unlike mine. I've run many versions of Linux on many systems over the years and upgrades have been quite smooth - the Debian / Ubuntu world is the most stable but Red Hat isn't far behind. The key again is binary packages - moving from a known set of packages to a known set of newer packages makes it a lot easier to test an upgrade.<p>> C) kernel vulnerabilities average once every few years in BSD vs ever few weeks (sometimes days) in Linux<p>Highly debatable but Linux or BSD kernel vulnerabilities are rare enough not to be worth arguing over: most of the threat is in userland, which is a large part of why package management is so important. Far more systems are compromised by lax updates rather than zero-days.",1350065969

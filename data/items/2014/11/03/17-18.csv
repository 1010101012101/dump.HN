Sure, theoretically they can execute the code, but the performance will be so far from the expectations of the developer that they will just end up telling the user to switch to Firefox (maybe Chrome if they can ever catch up).<p>> Why would normal JS developers be writing in asm.js? Do you even understand why asm.js exists?<p>Normal JS developers would use asm.js if they needed extra performance. I occasionally need extra performance out of javascript, so I use heavily optimized clojurescript, which helps for some applications. If I had exhausted those options, I would try programming in C and compiling to asm.js.<p>> What barriers to entry? You download the emscripten SDK and you compile your existing C/C++ app to asm.js.<p>Ha. You obviously haven&#x27;t tried to do that yet. asm.js is intended to be a compiler target for many languages. It only succeeds for two languages (C/C++), thanks to emscriptem more than asm.js, and even that is not trivial. It takes significant effort to port most C/C++ applications...otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have their own codebases, they would just be a different target on a makefile. If it were as simple as you make it out to be, we would have hundreds of languages compiling to asm.js by now; C/C++, but also every language that compiles to C/C++ or LLVM bytecode. As it is, we have maybe a couple dozen large legacy codebases that have been ported.<p>> It&#x27;s not a VM, there&#x27;s no JIT involved.<p>A VM does not necessarily imply JIT, but that is beside the point. A VM executes bytecode, and asm.js is an attempt to use javascript as bytecode. Javascript wasn&#x27;t designed as a VM, and several of its &quot;features&quot; actively subvert its use as a VM, which is why asm.js relies on guarantees that you will not use those features.<p>If getting the performance that asm.js developers expect out of asm.js requires the use of a browser that optimizes for asm.js, then the solution isn&#x27;t cross-platform. In fact, it isn&#x27;t really any better than NaCL, god forbid.",1415037529

The entire global economy operates on what billions of humans want, and a good portion of them don&#x27;t even need most of the things that they want.<p>We have an entire industry--advertising--devoted to making people want more things.<p>So something like envy, which is to say wanting something that someone else has, is a significant driving factor behind economic activity.  Mental suffering and physical suffering amount to the same thing: unhappiness with the current state of affairs.  It does not matter if one person wants to not die of cholera while another wants a new smartphone with a faster processor.  It only matters what that person is willing to do or to forego to get that thing.<p>The first person may be willing to spend a week with a shovel in a pit filled with sewage to get adequate sanitation for the rest of the year.  The second person already has a flush toilet, complete with sewer and treatment plant, so maybe they&#x27;re just giving up new tires for their second car.<p>All of economics is just individual humans making choices about what they want.<p>Poor Americans have been told throughout their lives that they can have a certain lifestyle--pretty good in comparison to a lot of other countries--if they are willing to follow certain rules and spend some time working rather than playing.  Many of them are finding that to be a lie.  So perhaps they are suffering instead from a perceived betrayal of a social compact?  Everyone willing to produce shall be able to consume in equal measure?<p>What I am seeing through my biased eyes is that significant limitations are being placed on ordinary people&#x27;s ability to produce valuable goods and services, and so their ability to consume is falling below that required by their former customary standard of living.",1415037512

To be clear: we can have an interesting discussion on salaries, value of employees, etc. but if anyone takes any of these numbers, from this post, or a poll, and does so much as average them, they would immediately produce meaningless data. Some reasons:<p>- Participation is voluntary, the group is self-selected. This in itself renders all results meaningless.<p>- HN polls let you vote on more than one option, yet you only have one salary.<p>- Time of day bias. It is currently lunch hour on the east coast, and morning in the Bay area. Remote developers living in the UK, Thailand, etc. are on yet a different schedule.<p>- Whenever a discussion like this pops up, the workers have an incentive to lie. If you say &quot;I am top talent in my field and I make [2x my actual salary]&quot;, and enough people do this, you might actually raise the expectations of the employers. This discussion is actively giving a voice to the workers, and they have a huge reason to misrepresent facts for personal benefit.<p>I really wish HN got rid of polls.

This doesn&#x27;t mean the that whole concept has failed. It advanced many fields of AI and created many initiatives which are quite vibrant to this day (e.g. Linked Data). The illusion of failure of the semantic web is mostly due to the fact that today there are less semantic web projects funded. The money goes to other things that are now on the rise, the same as it was with semantic web 10 years ago. However semantic web is still here, with many tools mature enough to be applied in the industry. I don&#x27;t expect it to dissapear completely.",1415036366

The app could store a one-way hashed copy of the secret to verify the correct value had been received.

And there comes the rub: your fingerprint information is local per device and not transferred. These keychain items would only be decryptable on the same device and only as long as you don&#x27;t replace your recorded fingerprints.<p>This may be part of why Apple is only doing a yay/nay API at the moment - because anything more starts verging into people/devs complaining they can&#x27;t unlock their secrets when iCloud Keychain or device replacements are in use.<p>Apple is not currently transferring your TouchID biometrics between devices and I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a business they&#x27;re intentionally avoiding.",1415035862

I could spend hours talking about the consequences of being poor (in U.S. terms).<p>1. Your housing options automatically become drastically limited. If you have bad credit, you don&#x27;t get to pick and choose apartments or rental houses; you&#x27;re more likely to end up in shared living arrangements or in the kind of apartment complexes that are willing to house people with bad credit, which also means your stuff is more likely to be stolen -- stuff that you can&#x27;t afford to replace. (Having a load of laundry stolen was a hardship for me for about a year.)<p>2. Your employment options also become more limited. A lot of jobs, especially those that pay well, now do cursory background and credit checks as a proxy for judging whether or not you might try to rip them off. That of course makes it even harder to pay off your debt.<p>3. Forget about having reliable transportation. I&#x27;ve gone through 9 cars in less than 15 years: from one junker to the next. Used car prices are insane right now, so you&#x27;re going to be stuck with someone&#x27;s $500 or $1000 mechanic&#x27;s special -- because that&#x27;s all the cash you&#x27;ve managed to scrape together -- or you&#x27;ll be doing a lot of walking and public transportation, neither of which are terribly convenient in most places in the U.S., which again limits your job options.<p>4. That beater you drive, if you drive one, becomes a target for law enforcement. They are most interested in cars that look like their registration may not be current, look like they may be a road hazard, look like they may be driven by a college kid with marijuana under the seat, look like they have a broken window ... the increased scrutiny is not only irritating, it can get expensive too, depending on just how poor you are.<p>5. Because your finances are limited by a lower-paying job, you&#x27;re more likely to lack access to higher education, better quality food, or healthy hobbies.<p>6. You end up paying more for everything. You don&#x27;t get to take advantage of discounts (for example, paying 12 months of insurance up-front), and if you do have any credit cards, you&#x27;ll pay more on their rates.<p>7. If you don&#x27;t have credit cards, every unexpected personal financial problem becomes a disaster. Oh, your radiator just blew a seam? Well, I guess you won&#x27;t be driving anywhere for a while.<p>I&#x27;ll stop there. Anyway, I don&#x27;t completely disagree with you, but let&#x27;s not just skip over the consequences of having a lot of debt.

Chrome doesn&#x27;t support asm.js, but it runs asm.js apps just dandy, albeit not quite as fast as Firefox.<p>Chrome is hardly the most likely problem child; older versions of IE are more likely to taking up the rear when it comes to performance.<p>> I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s unreasonable about it. You compile native code to a portable intermediate language. It runs at near-native speed in some browsers, and reasonable speed in others. Yes, it&#x27;s a subset of JS. So? Why does this bother you?<p>Well, the biggest and most obvious reason to be bothered (though not the only one) is the concern that the journey through JS (as opposed to generating slightly-shackled native code and running that on the client) is going to impose a performance burden that the browser&#x27;s JS engine won&#x27;t be able to fully eliminate, at least in some cases. If you&#x27;re telling me that asm.js now consistently runs at roughly-as-good-as-native-code speeds across the board, then that is surprising but great news. It certainly didn&#x27;t seem to be the case three years ago, when we were assured that it was impossible to efficiently implement bignums in code compiled to JS, but I suppose things have been moving quickly in this area. Unfortunately OP doesn&#x27;t seem to fully support that idea, as it seems to imply that IonMonkey requires significant processor time to make the JS run fast. (Shuffling that overhead off to another thread may effectively remove the performance burden when running single-threaded code on a machine which has two or more idle cores and is plugged into the wall, but it comes back in other cases, including the case where several tabs are all running asm.js programs at the same time.)",1415035178

It&#x27;s also true that they don&#x27;t well fit the model for open source.  App stores define some root of trust for signing, but just like the CA model for HTTPS certificates, there are issues with that.  App stores also bring a host of issues with user freedom.  (Even the free ones can have this effect unintentionally: what percent of your coworkers know how to manage apt pinning?  If one person on ubuntu 10.04 has an working, installed package, and wants to hand that exact (known working) version of it to a friend on ubuntu 12.04, can they do it?)<p>PGP signed binaries are one major step in the right direction.  More friendly tools and popularized workflows for this would help a lot of people avoid major moments of vulnerability.<p>PGP (or any other signing system) also leave an interesting challenge, which is what to do in the case of key compromise.  Revocation is hard.  And say you want an audit log of all prior releases: what can you do?<p>We&#x27;re all used to git having an immutable log of history by hash chaining, at this point.  Is it time to start using systems like that to keep an auditable log of software releases, as well?<p>I&#x27;ve been working on something called &quot;mdm&quot; [1] that attempts to do an auditable, immutable chain of releases like this.  It was originally designed to be a dependency manager for (arbitrary, language-agnostic, any binaries) software development needs, but I wonder if something like this is what the software distribution world needs to start evolving towards as well.  Imagine if your end users could all verify that they have the same hash... and the same picture of historic releases from the same author, and the same picture of if the releaser&#x27;s signing key changed, and so on.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear other thoughts on how hash chains and signatures can be made to intersect to tell the broadest story.

You really need to look at the number of blocking requests and what they block – e.g. loading a large image might seem low-impact since browsers have progressive decoding but you often see cases where the load order goes like this:<p>1. HTML starts trickling in<p>2. Browser scans for resources and starts opening connections for stylesheets (great, since they block rendering) and other inline resources<p>3. Since you followed everyone&#x27;s advice and put your scripts at the bottom of the page, you now have 2MB of images saturating all of the available server connections so the JavaScript is waiting for a connection to complete and, of course, there&#x27;s no way to progressively render a script<p>4. The relatively small JS loader / jQuery / etc. eventually loading triggers a whole new set of requests which are now at the end of the queue behind all of the CSS and content references for images, fonts, etc.<p>HTTP/2.0 will help significantly with all of this but in the meantime various bundling hacks used to lower requests counts and the lack of dependencies as a first class concept mean that you tend to see a lot of unintended load delays unless someone has carefully profiled their page loading behaviour.",1415034341

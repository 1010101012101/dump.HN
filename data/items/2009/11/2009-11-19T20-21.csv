On top of this, what if you want to use a different library. How would we choose to use jQuery as opposed to Dojo or Prototype, etc.<p>I think the way things are right now, it works just fine with one small exception: I got spoiled by jQuery. I do everything in it. I don't mean just web projects, I mean I do command line stuff with it. I have Firebug installed and so every time I end up on a website where I need to extract some information out of it, I fire up Firebug and do something along the lines of this:<p>(function(){ var x = document.createElement( 'script' ); x.src=""<a href=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min...</a>; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild( x ) } )();<p>// Wait for jQuery to load...<p>jQuery('span.comhead').each(function(){ console.log( jQuery(this).text() ) });<p>It would really be ideal if Firebug shipped with jQuery built in, or at least have an option.

951023,comment,950591,950985,0,0,imgabe,,,"Thanks for your feedback.<p>I think the differentiating factor with other news aggregators is the argument feature. Lots of times an interesting discussion on reddit or hacker news will get lost somewhere at the bottom of the comment page. By breaking it out to an argument thread it can get more exposure, and be available for other users to read who might have otherwise missed it. I often find the comments sections of sites like this to be more interesting than the articles themselves, I'm hoping this makes comments more readable and usable.<p>Arguments are decided by votes. The argument is active for 7 days or until the participants decide to call a draw or one concedes. At the end of the 7 days, the argument is ended and the user with the most votes is the winner.<p>A leaderboard or ranking system is definitely in the works. Right now it would just show all users at 0 though. Scores at this point are just the total number of arguments won. I'm still evaluating if that's the best way to go, but I think it will work well enough to start. Something like the Elo rating system (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system</a>) used for chess ratings might be better, but time will tell.<p>UI design is definitely not my strong suit, so I tried to keep it as simple as possible. Your suggestion is appreciated, though.<p>I've been tweaking the copy at the top of the home page for a while to try to explain the site as succinctly as possible to leave more room for topics and arguments. A sidebar might be a better way to make it stand out.<p>Facebook integration is definitely on my long list of improvements to make.

Those 'phones' are going to be their only computer, their only access to the internet, and their only device that would allow application development.<p>If we, using the royal hacker we, could develop a mobile or web-based development environment that worked on mobile devices it could enable a new population of developers that dwarfs the number of devs we have in the world now.

951012,comment,950751,950751,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"Part of Paul's reasoning depends on Apps being central to the iPhone experience the same way software is central to the desktop experience. I'm not totally sure this is the case. While apps are certainly a major component to the iPhone, are they really <i>the</i> major factor in end-user adoption? With the exception of games, how many killer iPhone apps are there that don't already ship with the phone? The phone shipped for an entire year without an App Store at all. I even read something not that long ago that said the majority of apps sit unused on people's phones after they get them.<p>Now, this doesn't mean that developers won't want a developer friendly phone, or that Apple is hurting their reputation with developers. I'm certain it has been frustrating to deal with the whole process. However, if 3rd party software isn't essential for the iPhone as a platform, then developer satisfaction moves down a bit in terms of importance in Apple's eyes.<p>Now, it's clear that games are major for the app store. Games are also a special class of software application that benefits disproportionately from having access to the hardware at a low level. They also have properties more similar to music and movies (incidentally, things the iTunes store is good at selling). Except for the simplest games, they require a lot of up-front design work and investment. It's rare that a released game goes through a ton of rapid iterations to ""get it right"". Games may still have bugs after release, but in general the functionality they are going to have is there on day one. They also ship with the final sound effects, music, artwork, etc... Games are also probably very unlikely to ""duplicate existing functinoality"" or any of the other cases where ""normal"" apps hit barriers. Perhaps Apple has (intentionally or unintentionally) created an environment optimized for game approval?<p>I'm certainly not defending the app store process, but I just wonder if the software development community has a disproportionate view of its importance to the iPhone as a whole.",1258662323

There exist on-board development environments for Windows CE/Pocket PC/Windows Mobile (even Common Lisp and Emacs) and Symbian (including Python). 
So in this respect the iPhone/Android platforms are a step back from truly open mobile development environments. This step back is the result of the backwardness of operator-controlled American mobile market.

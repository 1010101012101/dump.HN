It is essentially another form of entertainment, after all, similar to acting or sports.  Still it feels cheap to me, as it doesn't even require the physical might that at least athletics demands.  With so many people working so hard to make a living, it seems unfair for someone to do so playing video games.<p>Maybe this shitty economy will help weed out the lazy and force people to be useful again.",1238677140

543241,comment,543069,543136,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Obviously, failing to look ahead is a mistake. But it is also a mistake to project too far ahead. Remember Keynes' famous aphorism: ""In the long run, we are all dead.""<p>You're thinking in equilibrium terms. Yes, it's easy to imagine that one day this business will reach a low-margin equilibrium. Though that doesn't guarantee it will happen in our lifetimes. (An example of a factor that mitigates against it: Monopolies. Get a monopoly, and you can keep margins artificially high.) And just because something will eventually be commoditized doesn't mean it will <i>never</i> be a high margin business. Margins can be quite high at the beginning. And, if you stay out of the business because you're afraid of what will happen in ten years, you miss out on all that money that's on the table <i>now</i>. Just imagine if Microsoft had been unwilling to release Windows 95 because it was obvious that in ten years we'd all be trying to switch to Unix.<p>The electronic component industry knows all about this curve. Component manufacturers race to ramp up early production of a new part, because the part sells for higher margins when it is first to market. Within a year or two other manufacturers will clone your part, or invent alternatives, and your margins will drop to tiny levels. But by then you'll hopefully have ramped up something else. The business has worked that way for a long time.<p>In the case of this new Amazon service... I have never heard of Hadoop before. By releasing a turnkey service with big fanfare, Amazon will grow the market to include people like me. Because we have no clue what we're doing at first, they can charge us high margins for a standardized, widespread service with a relative wealth of documentation and buzz and (perhaps) some tech support. Eventually the market will stop growing, the customers will be educated and start hunting for bargains... and Amazon will move on to something else.",1238676982

If the past serves as any indication, this regulation will be cumbersome, ill-thought out, and expensive.<p>Now, I'm not saying I am totally opposed to Government oversight, but this just illustrates a larger problem in our system- a few bad apples cause the entire system to fall apart and forces many good companies to jump through hoops and raise the cost burden on consumers.<p>Now, in this particular case- shouldn't the FDA be overseeing this?",1238676960
543239,comment,543069,543223,0,0,rjurney,,,"Every single technology they've built on here is open: 'PC hardware', Xen, Linux, Java, Hadoop, HTML, SOAP, Javascript, Web Services.  The unique components are their grid technology and interface and that they have wrapped it all as a reliable, easy to use and all around great product.  Thats why Amazon is so incredibly smart: they maximumize use of open source to create unique and valuable offerings that solve fundamental pain.  Last week doing hadoop computes was a pain in the ass.  This week its not.  Value.<p>This is the most amazing thing going, Amazon is leading the market and continuously innovating, and you don't buy it because of 'switching costs.'

Never mind the UK, Europe needs a proper YC clone, and if one gets significant traction anywhere in the EU/EFTA it'll have the same kind of advantage in that space as YC does in the US, i.e. first pick.<p>A good YC clone would be fantastic but (as the sainted pg says, pbuh) angels are the limiting factor. YC Edinburgh would be fantastic and given time might be sufficient to build a proper startup hub, but if some entity ponies up the cash for the ""buy a Silicon Valley"" plan, you're crushed. Even aside from that a substantial portion of any Scottish clone's rounds would end up in London.<p>Dragon's Den\nPro- They decide very quickly.\nCon- The expertise is not there, so they will say yes seldom.\nSeedcamp\nThey're later stage than YC.

543222,comment,542716,543200,0,0,rimantas,,,"Speed is very important. However: how much time does server spend running your Ruby code? I think I saw somewhere it is about 5% of the request time. There is DB, network latency, all the client side cruft (twitter did not get even assets caching right yet). Article says they are leaving Ruby in place for the front end, so most likely they do understand where bottleneck is, and where it has nothing to do with a language.<p>I just hope that other won't jump to porting their code without understanding the reasons. It should be pretty embarrassing to spend six month porting the codebase just to find out that reducing time server spends in your app code from 5% to 1% did not impact the overall speed of your site.<p>It would be interesting to see more details about those queue processing problems they have though.",1238675921

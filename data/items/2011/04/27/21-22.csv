2491237,story,,,3,7,aaronh,"Advice on marketing and pricing in a niche market?",,"Hi everyone, my partner and I founded our business about six months ago with the long term goal of building a new generation of web-based software for veterinarians (http://menagerievet.com).  This market is clogged with expensive and ancient desktop (mostly Windows) software.  Our first product is a digital ""whiteboard"" which allows veterinary clinics to manage patient workflow instead of relying on paper and index cards.  The idea was to start with a small product to ""get in the door"" and start generating some interest.<p>We are both technical co-founders and it seems like many other engineers we feel we are stumbling around in the dark a little as we try to market this product and ourselves.  I was wondering if the hacker news hordes had any advice for us.  Our (somewhat informed) assumption coming in was that veterinarians would be a hard group to reach via web and social network marketing, however we have been pleasantly surprised at the amount of connections we have been able to make via twitter.  (we also do adwords, ahem, and have sent out a very small physical mailing batch, as well as gone door-to-door to some local practices).  However, we're not yet seeing the interest we'd hoped for, so I'm wondering if anybody has advice regarding marketing, and also pricing of our product.  We started with a traditional fixed-price downloadable ""boxed software"" model due to some arbitrary initial circumstances, but have switched to a SaaS model with monthly pricing (and we still feel SaaS is the right long term goal).  We are toying with lowering the price, and switching back to an up-front yearly subscription.<p>Since our ultimate goal is a more ambitious practice management system, we can also envision pricing tiers differentiated either on more whiteboard features, or further practice/records management integration.\nOr maybe it's time to cut the losses and pivot.  I don't want to bore you to death with more background, but I'm glad to share in the comments if there are questions.<p>TIA for any feedback.

2491234,story,,,1,0,ammarkalim,"Can Google exploit the tablet market?",,"The smartphone market is pretty hot right now. Apple and Google are fighting very religiously over it. There were few factors which enabled Google to gain a considerable market share like pricing and multiple carriers, and Google was able to exploit them pretty well. But tablet market is something very different, and it will be fascinating to what will happen in the future with the tablet industry. \n1) Apple has secured future contracts with suppliers which enabled them to produce a tablet at lower price point which (as yet) cannot be matched by any Google OEM.<p>2) Since tablet can be used without any contract, there is no carrier tied to it. There was a major factor which enabled Android to gain market share<p>Due you think that as a result of these two factors there will be no good quality Android tablet at a lower price points. If a $500 tablet is produced by a Google OEM i am sure that a lot of people will buy iPad instead, so i believe that Google OEM need to beat this price point, which is quite hard to for see in future.

You can modify it like the firmware version tho. Also they can detect backups this way<p>[user4] user2, is that in data sent to<p><pre><code>  a0.[CC].np.communication.PlayStation.net\n</code></pre>\n[user2] Sony is the biggest spy ever, lol. All connected devices return values sent to Sony server. Returns tv, fw version, fw type, console model. also i found data it collects when i had USB device attached etc etc. so if they ever sue someone for PSN stuff, they will be sued themselves, as most of the data they collect is just not legal<p>[user6] user2: do you now know enough to wipe all traces, so that people who never had their consoles on the internet can avoid sending this information now?<p>[user2] @xxxx: we could modify the data via proxy between the tunnels, like delete all data between the XML tags or something<p>[user1] the only avoidance is block all<p><pre><code>  *.PlayStation.net\n</code></pre>\n[user2] it could be that it's used for online playtime or PSN logged in playtime. For example: [redacted plain text code, includes false credit card number] sent as plaintext<p>[user1] wow, plaintext :S<p>[user5] plaintext wow<p>[user3] I'm never putting in my details like that<p>[user2] normally you AT LEAST encrypt the security code, even if its ssl<p>[user5] I'd hope Sony would do such in a safe manner, psn cards probably plain text to then<p>[user2] but hey it's Sony > it's a feature<p>[user7] from all the actions theyve taken the past years, we can only deduce that Sony dont care about their customers<p>[user2] I know a few guys who worked @ Sony's PSN backend. Just when the ps3 was released we talked bout the first PSN, at this time ALL was HTTP and unencrypted. So you could see user/pass etc plain. I asked them, why is it that way. Lame answer was we thought it was addressed.  lol<p>[user8] that fits nicely into the #define rand() 4 mentality.<p>[user2] another funny function I found is regarding PSN downloads, its when a pkg game is requested from the store, in the URL itself you can define if you get the game free or not. Requires some modification in hashes and so on though. It's like drm:off<p>[user1] :facepalm:<p>[user2] still wondering when the big ban wave arrives<p>[user1] if they ban everyone, even using backups legally in their country (but in their opinion a TOS violation), it will be a huge tsunami, not a wave<p>[user4] an open PSN would be nice, even if it was just a player matching service<p>[user2] ya, a PSN host by the community<p>[user3] that actually could be perhaps possible, if you can get auth working<p>[user12] you can try to analyze the protocol and say if X then Y type responses the problems come up when you get something you haven't seen before. But for stuff like that the ticket has to exist on the PSN side of things, because if I send my ticket to a vendor server they will validate it against PSN, and if it's not there it will fail. Know this, Sony in realtime, monitors all messages over PSN. I verified that, it's part of my privacy threats thing I am doing. They appear to have at the very least keywords they look for, not sure just how invasive the whole thing is, but <p>[user4] the censor word-list is ridiculous<p>[user12] the censor words in home is on your system, it downloads a dict list of words. an empty file resolves that<p>[user2] There actually is an easy way to get userlists. It would fuck PSN pretty hard if some skiddy releases a spam app. The highscore and matchmaking lobbies you can request per game id and get user mails for PSN. Huge list + spam app == sux. And we all know what happens if cool homebrew arrives, remember open remote play? Sony just releases an official tool lol. The PSN has 45 environments all working independent, we could just change to another environment. And they also need to have an eye to the official developers which use environments too, and the QA which needs to work with older firmware sometimes, so they can't update all environments and block all<p>[user4] luckily they use<p><pre><code>  CN=*.*.np.community.PlayStation.net\n</code></pre>\nwhich saves a bit of hassle, just calling openssl from your app user12 ?<p>[user12] openssl libs, not the app itself. And I do it for <i>ALL</i> ssl connections in realtime, so even if you use the web browser it will generate certs for that too. It is similar in function to sslsniff but mine works with the ps3 and logs correctly<p>[user2] btw you know the login url for auth is like:<p><pre><code>  &serviceid=IV0001-NPXS01001_00&loginid=MYMAIL&password=MYPASS&first=true&consoleid=MYID\n</code></pre>\n[user14] please not connect to external DNS IP with your ps3. Your passwords and email and other data is revealed on the external side. spam people can use this info for spamming<p>[user12] if it's just the firmware check then no, because there is nothing private sent in that http (cleartext) request. So it depends on what hosts they are looking at<p>[user2] for a test POST i worked with 1 only and always worked. Probably many to identify the service<p>[user12] the ticket is sent to say a game, Netflix, etc. anything that uses PSN. That way you do not send credentials to anyone but Sony<p>[user2] if it's like you say then this is another vuln, lol, as i tested if always first ticket works you could hijack a session the ticket and session i used didn't timeout and if it always creates a new ticket as you say there would be many sessions<p>[user12] I also know that the server that does the x-i-5 tickets is a bit more tight about the ciphers than any other system in sonyland. If Sony is watching this channel they should know that running an older version of apache on a redhat server with known vulnerabilities is not wise, especially when that server freely reports its version and its the auth server.<p><pre><code>  auth.np.ac.PlayStation.net\n</code></pre>\n[user11] you know, watching this conversation makes me think about whether it was a good idea after all to buy a couple of games from PSN using a Visa card<p>[user12] they are running linux 2.6.9-2.6.24 on that box too. that too is old. My guess is that it really is undermaintained it works why change anything.\n[user12] Sony really should update that stuff to something more current<p>[user2] but imagine, psn == 45 environments, and for example, every env has 50 subdomains\n to external machines. It's rly rly huge.

First of all, I'm not an idiot birther, so I don't have any questions about the president's legitimacy, but I thought that this article: http://wireupdate.com/video/2011/04/president-obamas-birth-certificate-pdf-has-layers/ made an interesting claim and decided to investigate it. Turns out, it is factually correct.<p>I'm a designer who's an expert in PDF's (stop giggling!) and hacking apart PDF's and similar types of documents is a small hobby for me. Granted, this isn't <i>hacking</i> in any real sense, but I certainly piqued my interest for non-political reasons.<p>Luckily for you, I've done a lot of the footwork for you and have posted my results below.<p>I just downloaded the form here: http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-long-form.pdf and popped it open in Illustrator CS5. The article is correct in that it is not one flat scan, it is a composition. It's composed of 10 sub-layers most of which contain very small portions of scanned text.<p>More than likely, there were multiple scans made of the same document, and they were collated into this image or Optical Character Recognition was used for the scan. Editing isn't particularly surprising if certain sections needed to be touched up, but it is unusual.<p>It's not an issue really but, I don't understand why they didn't just flatten everything before converting it to final PDF.<p>For those interested, I made jpgs of the exploded document so that you can see exactly what is removed when the layers are sequentially turned off. Check it out here: http://imgur.com/a/Wy6li.<p>Maybe it's the equivalent of a clerical error, or maybe it's a political move to keep the birther's frothing at the mouth. Or maybe it's nothing at all.

The USPTO couldn't load up Apple's legal-Bazooka fast enough if they tried.. To be honest, you would naive to think that this wasn't pushed through anyway.

For instance, the following is my exact feeling on this matter.<p>There are only two non-bigoted positions to have on this issue.  One, it's OK for people to segregate private groups by race, gender, etc... Or, two, its not OK at all.  Any position in between can only be justified by relying on stereo types.",1342655817

For example, the early commercial dial-up service providers like AOL or MCI Mail could have evolved into a global network even if there were no ARPANET. Unix systems were exchanging e-mail and net news across the world independently of ARPANET for many years. So were IBM mainframes at universities, via BITNET. The communications infrastructure that the ARPANET used -- leased long-distance phone lines -- was available to anybody who had the money to lease them. There were commercially developed network protocols (e.g., SNA from IBM or DECNET from DEC) and their associated networking hardware that could have been used as alternatives to TCP/IP and IMPs. And the operating systems that ran on the ARPANET hosts were commercially developed (TOPS-20 from DEC, Unix from AT&T, etc.).",1342655764

Solaris is a complicated tale.<p>The short explanation is that when Oracle acquired Sun, all of the hopes and dreams of Solaris users, particularly OpenSolaris users, were dashed. Many great technologies were pushed onto the back burner. All of Sun's Open Source portfolio saw a massive shake up and very little came out the other side healthier. Pre-acquisition, Solaris/OpenSolaris was a reasonable OS choice for new server deployments, particularly in cloud environments. Post-acquisition, you'd have to be a little bit nuts to deploy Solaris. Solaris has a lot of die-hard fans, with good reason...so this was a bitter pill to swallow for a lot of folks.<p>Oracle is simply ham-fisted when it comes to dealing with Open Source technologies that it comes into possession of. It's a really good example of a company that doesn't ""get"" Open Source.

This was a company that literally dumped technology on our country, the physics historian Michael Riordan has said of Bell Labs. I dont think well see an organization with that kind of record ever again. The expectation that, say, Google or Apple could behave like Bell Labsthat such companies could invest heavily in basic or applied research and then sprinkle the results freely around Californiaseems misplaced, if not naive. Such companies dont exist as part of a highly regulated national public trust. They exist as part of our international capital markets. They are superb at producing a specific and limited range of technology products.</i><p>...<p><i>Ive often said to my old friends that we were very lucky we got to work there, in an environment that I dont think will ever exist again, remarks Dick Frenkiel, who worked on the first generation of cellular technology. Its hard to say something will never happen again. But with the monopoly gone, with the whole concept of monopoly essentially discredited, how could there ever be a place like that again?</i><p>...<p><i>That perceived natural monopoly wasnt only justified by the phone systems technological complexity and interdependence; it was alsoin an argument that telephone executives made over and over againa matter of economics. With one company in effect serving the countrys phone customers, some parts of the phone business that were highly profitable, such as long-distance service, could subsidize other aspects that were less profitable, such as local calling. Profits from high-paying corporate customers, moreover, could subsidize service to residential customers. Profits from dense urban areas could subsidize expansion into sparse rural areas. All in all, this kind of averaging, as it was sometimes called, helped make telephone service available and affordable for most Americans.</i><p>...<p><i>In testimony before the U.S. Senates Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly, Bill Baker asserted that the notion that Bell Laboratories could endure and function away from AT&T, Western Electric, and the operating integrated Bell System would be laughable were it not so sinister and so ominous.

4263454,comment,4261619,4262432,3,0,dinkumthinkum,,,">Dude, I'm a fairly new user with low karma but I'm going to burn every bit of it up in this one post so I'm going to try to make it good.\n>First, let me ask you a question. What's the poorest country in the western hemisphere? Haiti. What makes it ""special""? Now, what's the poorest most impoverished continent in the world? Africa. What makes it ""special""? I think you get the picture.<p>What utter racist drivel is this? In a later comment you get upset by someone equating your position with thinking intelligence with economic status but you are clearly making such a claim here. Well, by and large Asia is a pretty dirt poor continent as well, what do you have to say about that? Do you think Africa just popped into existence recently? There is a whole historical force at work. OK, clearly Africa as continent (I guess we have to ignore Egypt under your view) has done a pretty bad job developing large civilizations/militaries and eventually becoming a world Imperial power. The connection between Haiti and Africa as two ""separate"" examples is pretty ignorant, do you know how Haiti become populated with all those people? Are familiar with this idea called the slave trade?<p>>I'm going to tell you a little secret. Black people statistically speaking are intellectually inferior. You don't have to like it, I don't have to like it, the Hacker News zeitgeist doesn't have to like it but it's true.<p>Prove it. That's a bold claim and linking to a bunch of white supremacist web sites or links to Wikipedia that admit not credibility won't help you prove your argument Herr Doktor. It is not ""Hacker News zeitgeist"" to say that you are proffering a pretty controversial statement with no evidence in fact is very incidiary. I agree that if there was actual, we should admit, but there is no truth to this notion Herr Doctor.<p>>The question is, what do you do about that. Do you pretend everybody is the same and give everybody equal opportunity sink or swim? That sounds good in the libertarian utopia but the fact is we live in the real world and if you do that you are going to have a class of people that will never reach parity no matter what happens.<p>>Left to their own devices, black people are incapable as a group to ever reach the cultural and social level of white and Asian people.<p>That's just ridiculous. I'm still waiting for the proof.<p>>That being the case, you can either live with that which is a non-starter unless you want downtown SF look like downtown Johannesburg.<p>Do you think such phenomena does not exist in white or Asian cultures? If that is the case you are either very naive, ignorant, or have never traveled anywhere but the last is no excuse because apparently you do have the Internet. What you allude to exists in droves among white populations, without question.<p>>So the only realistic option is to ""stack the deck"". Everyone that has ever thought about it for more than 5 minutes realizes that this has to happen in order for our mixed society to remain sane. The ivory tower ""liberals"" understand this far more than you realize and despite the public rhetoric of equality, behind the scenes, the dials are turned to make sure that despite the fact that blacks could never compete on merit, there is just enough stacked in their favor and just subtly enough that they have at least some chance. Thus programs like BlackGirlsCode.\n>And that's it. I don't like it. I wish blacks were on par intellectually but that just isn't the case and won't be anytime soon so I buy in to this ""fix"". Give it some thought and you might too.<p>This is just trash and so are you. Where is the evidence. There is quite the evidence to the contrary. If this was the case why are there so many black PhDs, scientists, etc. Sure, there is not as many for various non-genetic reasons but under your view they shouldn't even exist. How could do they? I mean under your view, perhpas there could be ONE because I guess you'd argue that person would be like strange anomaly but there are clearly more than that. It's ridiculous. In fact, we don't even need to point to PhDs and other scientists, because you are arguing blacks are intellectually inferior. Have you ever met a black a person other than when you might be running scared from crackheads in downtown San Francisco? There are white crackheads to you know.<p>>BTW, before you get too far off on your own superiority remember that Ashkenazi jews (Einstein, etc.) are statistically a fifth to a full standard deviation above the average in mathematical and verbal IQ tests. Ever wonder why something like 50 percent of the nobel prizes go to them? <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jewish_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jewish_intelligence</a><p>You make a bad argument for intelligence when you seem to be unable to read and comprehend your own Wikipedia links. Ever read your own Wikipedia links? There is nothing contained that article that amounts to anything scientific other than some vague references to a cultural tradition of close study and scholarship as well as increased economic position.<p>Do you think a complete lack of anything resembling science does not matter as long as your point is a racist one?<p>>Bye bye Karma.<p>Stop projecting.",1342652889

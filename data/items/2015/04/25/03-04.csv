9437143,comment,9434760,9436265,0,0,zanny,,,"NPC actions (actions in general besides movement, particular to WoW) are server-side. Most WoW private server cores come able to handle player interactions and the &quot;default&quot; mob pathing / behavior AI, but it is generic to every version of the game. The server maintainer than overrides the default behaviors for every NPC they or object they want to script. IE, cast X spell, or use Y item.<p>There are servers for every version of the game that I know of that at least strive to be &quot;blizzlike&quot; with mob and world behavior. It can get pretty complicated, for example the Icecrown Citadel Lich King fight, which I know works pretty well on Molten but I have never tried it elsewhere. It has environment destruction, player teleportation, mob spawning, player movement via mob interaction, and multiple NPC interactions. That would be a bitch to reimplement, I imagine.",1429934317

9437141,comment,9434760,9436999,0,0,nieve,,,"Having played WoW for years and gotten into just about every corner of the maps, almost all the undeveloped regions, and every Easter Egg area I heard about in Vanilla I have to say it was one of my favorite activities in the game and completely unrewarded.  Guild Wars 2 rewards just about everything with XP (crafting, gathering, some achievements), but exploration & map completion also come with tangible rewards and enough XP to level a ton just running around.  It&#x27;s a really nice feeling to track down that last hidden point of interest or vista and have the big announcement pop up.  There&#x27;s a big reward for 100% completion of all maps, but not many people make it there.<p>Basically GW2 is a game that respects your time - waypoint teleports instead of flight paths, no corpse runs, no tagging mobs, per-character (or maybe player?) resource nodes, world events you can just jump into and everyone receives credit based on participation, area quests you don&#x27;t have to pick up to start getting participation, and a lot you can do at the level cap that&#x27;s not grinding gear - in fact the best is almost all crafted.  I think this has to come down to the game being an initial purchase plus very carefully designed micropayment options instead of a subscription model.  The micropayments are pretty much all vanity stuff or conveniences like extra bank slots, there&#x27;s no gear and the only content options are Living Story episodes you weren&#x27;t around for.  Gold is easy to acquire & swap for the currency.<p>I think Blizzard tried to introduce some of this stuff in Mists of Pandaria, but there&#x27;s just too big a gap for them to bridge now.  Guild Wars 2 is missing world PvP, but has huge World-versus-World three way maps and team-based PvP.  I miss Southshore mass insanity as much as anyone, but WvW is better.",1429934264

9437131,comment,9436828,9436828,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>I&#x27;ve heard failure is good, but 10 years is a long time. That&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve been failing for now.</i><p>You&#x27;re considering &quot;giving up&quot; after 10 years? You have no fucking idea. No offense, but you&#x27;re just spoiled by a culture of instant gratification. In most societies and in most of history, it took <i>generational</i> timespans to go from nothing to wealth. People moved to the towns at 15 as laborers (often worse off than peasants) so their kids could join the working class and their grandkids would have a shot at joining guilds so their great-great-grandkids would be wealthy merchants and their fourth-great-grandkids (whom they&#x27;d never live to see) just might join the gentry or the lowest edge of nobility.<p>It&#x27;s not your fault. The crime of the pseudo-meritocracy that exists now is that (a) well over 90% of the people who have knock-out success by age 25 had parental lift, but (b) society does a damn good job of making sure that it looks like they earned it. It makes rapid ascension look not just possible, but normal. It&#x27;s not: not even fucking close.<p>You feel like a failure because you&#x27;re comparing yourself to people who have all sorts of ridiculous, but also invisible, advantages. You shouldn&#x27;t beat yourself up that you can&#x27;t compete with the kids who close $5 million seed rounds fresh out of Stanford. That&#x27;s like trying to compete with a cheetah in the 100m dash: you just weren&#x27;t born with it.<p><i>When I was 15 me and my friend started a little hosting website. It was really fun. I learnt to program, and we even made a little bit of money. In the excitement I began to learn about business, startups and programming. I thought it was going to be so easy to make money.</i><p>It sounds like you didn&#x27;t fail. Not making money is failing. Having to turn off the lights is failing. You learned how to program and turned a profit on your first project. That sounds like success (albeit minor) to me.<p><i>Because for the last 10 years I&#x27;ve worked 16-18 hours a day, every day, with absolutely nothing to show from it.</i><p>Yeah, you should probably change that. That&#x27;s unsustainable. You sound burned out. I&#x27;d be worse off than you are if I worked that much.<p>You need to exercise, you need a social life, you need things in your life that aren&#x27;t work, and you need some damn down time. Don&#x27;t just &quot;book that holiday&quot; (it&#x27;s not a bad idea, but it&#x27;s not enough). Stop working hard and start working smart. If it&#x27;s not important, don&#x27;t do it. If it is important, you probably want to be well-rested when you do it, which rules out 120-hour weeks.<p><i>Because 10 years later I&#x27;m suck in a day job as a programmer.</i><p>Well, if you drop back to an 8-hour day, you&#x27;ll hate it a lot less. Give yourself a break. Most people don&#x27;t hate being in day jobs because most people don&#x27;t work so hard as to make themselves miserable. They show up at 9:00, leave around 5:30, socialize a bit at work, and once they&#x27;ve been at the job for a year or two, they figure out a way to work mainly on the parts of the job that they enjoy. You should try it.<p>And for a dirty secret: you can probably get away with 2-3 hours per day of actual work at most day jobs. I don&#x27;t advise slacking to that extreme. It&#x27;s bad for your career to fuck around, and even though you probably won&#x27;t get fired, people will notice and not like you and it&#x27;ll make your life unpleasant. But you&#x27;re literally working an order of magnitude more, right now, than the minimum not to get fired.<p>Also, stop reading Techcrunch because the 25-year-olds whose startups turned into unicorns or thestrals or chimeras or whatever the fuck mythological creature they are using to describe hot-shit companies had so much parental lift (and luck) that it&#x27;s useless to make a comparison.<p>You mention being stuck &quot;as a programmer&quot;. Do you not like programming? If you don&#x27;t like it, then stop doing it. That&#x27;s not giving up. That&#x27;s choosing not to do something that you don&#x27;t enjoy. If you do like programming, then find your way to projects that you&#x27;re enthusiastic about, and find a way to blow off or delegate the dreck work (see the above about slacking, and learn a bit about office politics).<p><i>Something I never wanted to be, I just wanted to build a business.</i><p>Then, you have three options. One: get some capital and start a business. If your social life is as pathetic as you&#x27;ve claimed it to be, then you probably have some savings. But don&#x27;t do this until you&#x27;ve taken a break because starting your own business will call for some long hours... and you need some time to slack (relative to what you&#x27;ve been doing) and un-burn-out. Two: bootstrap a business using the time not spent on your day job (unless you&#x27;re getting rapidly promoted, we&#x27;ve already gone over the fact that you shouldn&#x27;t put more than 40-45 hours on it). You&#x27;ve shown that you can work smart but you need to work hard. Three: get into a top-5 MBA school. If you&#x27;re a half-decent engineer than you&#x27;re already smarter than 97% of Harvard MBA students although you may need some work on the social polish aspect. That&#x27;s not going to help you as an entrepreneur but it&#x27;ll get you into VC and then you can become a founder or startup executive after your time in VC.<p><i>I&#x27;ve lost some of the best years of my life behind a text editor and a dream.</i><p>15 to 25? Those aren&#x27;t the best years of most peoples&#x27; lives. Being a teenager is terrible in the U.S., college is overhyped and socially disappointing for most people-- especially men-- and pretty much everyone from 22-25 is confused, rapidly losing touch with his previous self and likely falling out of contact with old friends, and working in a job that&#x27;s below what college trained him to expect.<p>Most of the older people I know say that the best years of their lives are the last healthy years, typically meaning 50s and 60s. Until your health goes for good, it keeps getting better, and the end is usually not far after that. My mother said that the best years of her life were her 50s, except for the health issues (cancer) that she had toward the end of the decade (she died at 59). I think that&#x27;s common: most older people are happier than when younger and don&#x27;t want to go back to who they were or the life they had when they were younger. (Obviously, no one would turn down having the body and health of a 25-year-old forever, if that were an option, but almost no one thinks that those are the best years.)<p>So, no, you haven&#x27;t lost the best years of your life. You are slowly becoming less physically attractive, but it&#x27;s surprising how little that matters, and it&#x27;s also easy to do something about. (If you stay in shape, you&#x27;ll be considered good looking for a <i>long</i> time.) Don&#x27;t worry about it.<p><i>Not to mention the money and friends I&#x27;ve lost along the way.</i><p>Well, again, you should fix that pattern. My advice: getting emotional about money &quot;that got away&quot; is pointless. It&#x27;s business. Emotions put your eyes on the scoreboard rather than the ball. As for friends, you can always get in contact with old friends. They fell out of contact with you, just as you did with them, right? That happens, and people are pretty forgiving. It happens to all of us, especially those of us who work hard and are ridiculously busy.<p>Good luck. It doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re as much of a failure as you think you are. In fact, I&#x27;ll bet that you learned a lot. You&#x27;re just tired and need a rest.",1429933871

9437122,comment,9436416,9436416,0,0,michrassena,,,"The dynamic range limitations that slide film has and early color negative film had during the last century is a technology limitation.<p>The progression of film development is toward more dynamic range, finer grain, greater speed (sensitivity to light), and to truer color and color fastness.  If Kodak, or any other film maker were able to make a color film which could capture the wide dynamic range of skin tones, it&#x27;s likely they would have.  The benefits of a wider dynamic range have implications that even if the thesis of this article were true, would have driven the marketplace to adopt this better film.  Greater dynamic range is a generally desirable feature.<p>Film, as a technology, is limited.  What I would consider to be a more interesting discussion, would be to address the decisions made by photographers that resulted in the underexposure of non-white skin tones.<p>I&#x27;m fully willing to believe that a photographer took a photo of a group of people of mixed races, exposed the image such that the white people were properly exposed and called it a day, simply because in their estimation the proper exposure of the black faces was unimportant.  I can also believe that this happened quite a lot.  This can seem rather passive, on the part of the photographer, who can claim that film just can&#x27;t capture the dynamic range, rather than taking the time and effort to light the people properly, or other measures necessary.<p>One could also argue that 18% gray, as the default for exposure metering, prioritized the white face over the black one.<p>The substance of the argument that film is racist, could be rooted in these sociological issues, in the choices that were made by individuals everywhere, their assumptions and their decisions about who mattered.",1429933650

If someone tells you that you can&#x27;t have an impact because of western culture, they&#x27;re merely looking to prey on naivety or ignorance to further their own irrational agenda or bias.<p>To have a meaningful impact, you need a platform / vehicle. It&#x27;s what all people have in common that have made a positive difference throughout history.<p>You can do it by inventing something new that makes life better (easier, healthier, more fulfilling, etc). Imagine how much time and effort things like refrigeration save us today, and how much better that makes ~2 billion lives. If you save someone an hour per day with an invention like that, you&#x27;ve just given them more life in real terms - time with their children, time in which they can make a difference, or just spare them hardship.<p>You can make a lot of money and put that to good use.

Whether that&#x27;s civil rights, or universal suffrage, or liberty, or privacy, etc. Then you have to choose how to go about furthering it, whether through an organization, or writing on your own, or a dozen other options.<p>Bottom line, you must have a lever. Your platform / vehicle is at its core a system of leverage, ideally. Meaning, it&#x27;s something that other people too will care about, because it&#x27;s important.

Do I really want to spend 20, or 30, years of my life in a job I don&#x27;t enjoy that much for a dream that may never happen?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. All I really want from life is to build something I&#x27;m proud of. I don&#x27;t care much for cars, houses and holidays. They&#x27;re nice, but I&#x27;d give up any chance of having them if I could build something that fills me with passion everyday I wake up. It&#x27;s just, I can&#x27;t guarantee that the time I put into having those things will actually get me anywhere. I mean, I&#x27;ve already gambled 10 years unsuccessfully so far.<p>I really relate to what nacrikt said:<p>> I&#x27;m thinking about leaving tech, as a profession, because professionally it turns everything I love into a thing to loath.

That&#x27;s assuming you have the power to press a key and duplicate data that comprises a home and materialize it for your use. I&#x27;ll even throw in a housewarming gift basket and a helping hand.<p>The unethical people in these equations are the ones who try to bend the world to their whims of &quot;intellectual&quot; order. They see no problem with violence on human beings over literal duplication of information. Economically speaking, a lesser degree of unethical behavior surrounds only people who duplicate data <i>who would have</i> paid for said content. A minority of content spreads worldwide on that basis. Hundreds of millions of teenagers and adults getting online can barely afford an internet connection if even a personal computer. Meanwhile, the amount of content and producers exponentially increases. They are not &quot;completely unethical&quot; for taking part in fleeting, frivolous entertainment -- the vast amount of it they wouldn&#x27;t deem worthy to purchase in place of other choices. Everyone&#x27;s situation is different. Rarely in the human condition is something &quot;completely unethical&quot;, especially in the context of data and non-violent actions. Streaming services like Spotify are a good start. They respect the nature of information more. They try to appeal to hearts and minds. That&#x27;s healthy.<p>Then there are industries where net positives exist along with piracy. Growing the size of a user/fan base becomes an added dependency of future success. Industry sets adoption. Adoption sets industry. Piracy by individuals is tolerated or even internally respected, while only the piracy of moderate and large businesses is targeted. The world, for instance, was awash with Windows cracks and serials in the 90s and early 2000s, having a tremendous impact globally on people who couldn&#x27;t afford it or who wouldn&#x27;t buy it. In the absence of such piracy, such as by a hypothetical corporate-fascist state putting people to death or by magical DRM, Linux would be in millions of more households by now.",1429933017

I believe that between population growth and accelerating automation, that barring a major casualty event such as a large-scale pandemic, the number of people will eventually outnumber the number of useful jobs that legitimately need doing. (or that worse the resource burn to sustain the model will undermine its feasibility and that of &quot;good life&quot; in general).<p>To this end, I think we need good minds figuring out how a world works in which people are less busy and own less.

Christ, one guy in particular totally cut off my conversation with a YCombinator guy and didn&#x27;t acknowledge me when I tried to talk to him, just interested in networking with the YCombinator guy about his dumb 3-d printing network or whatever it was).

Not that there was any benefit, just that they needed to modernize the design and it wasn&#x27;t that harmful.

Heavensward will give some indications of things to come but I see them following WoW extremely closely, almost methodically. Some examples:<p><pre><code>  - For the longest time in FFXI equipment was golden; not in WoW and not in FFXIV\n  - &quot;Gear Score&quot; / &quot;Average Item Level&quot;\n  - Instanced-only endgame content\n  - Instant travel to every zone for all players who&#x27;ve been there before\n  - All content is beaten before the end of a content cycle\n  - No very high-end content which goes months or !years! without being taken down (Vrtra:~2yrs, AV:~4yrs, PW:~3yrs, etc.)\n  - General fight mechanics and style (don&#x27;t stand in the poo, tankbusters, buff-type mechanics); not really many new ideas at all\n  - Flying mounts added in first expansion; unavailable in first-version areas, only in expansion areas\n  - Character jumping in a FF-series game! Heresy!\n</code></pre>\nFFXIV is a WoW clone in just about every regard, it&#x27;s just young. That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing but it&#x27;s quite hard to say there&#x27;s much of anything being done differently.<p>Regarding FFXIV relics and revisiting zones; relic quests will be nerfed into oblivion with the expansion, just like all previous relic chains were when subsequent content was released. WoW used to make you run around areas and talk to people for legendary weapons too[1], even some of the areas mentioned in this article like Silithus. Then the level cap went up and people had little use for those items anymore.<p>This all boils down to MMOs lowering the entry bar by allowing new players to catch up with the most experienced players at a casual pace. You&#x27;re never very far behind the bleeding edge, could be caught up in a month or two. Whether or not that&#x27;s a good thing is opinion and perspective; FFXI required a very substantial commitment to compete in endgame and it definitely bordered on unhealthy obsession for many max-level players. That said, it&#x27;d be great to see some seriously difficult/&quot;unbeatable&quot; (preferably open-world) content, even if they use the old zones to make it happen world-boss-style.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-...</a>",1429931363

But it was also fairly buggy and some of its mechanics poorly designed. The most fun we had was whenever new content was introduced.\nFiguring out how things worked and then abusing it.<p>Once you were near the soft cap - there was no practical exp limit, level requirements just started to increase super-exponentially at some point - you just looked for other things to do. Trying to take on bosses that were considered too hard by coordinating more players than intended by the game system or abusing their AI, using the near-invulnerability one had in lower-level dungeons to lure hundreds of monsters around you, find breaks in the invisible walls to leave the map etc.<p>I think the sandbox aspects of even the least sandbox-y MMOs make the most fun.

Other languages have extremely popular frameworks or applications which serve to attract newcomers. People teach Swift or Objective-C to write iOS apps, Java for Android apps, JavaScript to do web apps, Ruby to write web backends in Rails, C# to write games in Unity... hell, people learn Java to make Minecraft mods.

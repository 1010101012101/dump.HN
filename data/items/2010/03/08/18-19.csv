That article is about people in the ICU--not merely outside the OR--where it is indeed paramount to take all measures possible to reduce the risk of infection.<p>If checklists are effective in reducing mortality in the ICU, then great; doctors and nurses should be insistently prodded to use them.  But this shouldn't be confused with a mandate to go hand-washing crazy for all hospitals and doctor's offices.  ICU patients make up a tiny percentage of all patients.<p>(As an aside, I am a bit skeptical of these pieces written in the popular press by experts in a certain field which criticize their colleagues.  Sometimes, it's a case where the field really has settled into a bad equilibrium, and the contrarian must go outside the fold to right the situation.  But often, it's simply an outlet for the contrarian to preach to an audience which doesn't have the expertise and experience to assess his claims.)",1268074747

There are ups and downs, and the downs can often be enough to bring people within inches of quitting. People want to believe, but oftentimes doubt begins to creep in when bad news or setbacks hits from all sides; it's in these instances that clinging to something, anything positive, even if it's corny, can be the only thing that keeps one going. When balancing all the complexities which often have to be dealt with I think it's surprisingly easy to forget basics sometimes. As I said, we're human.

1176078,comment,1176039,1176039,0,0,joshkaufman,,,"Just got this e-mail from Amazon, terminating my Associates account - effective immediately. No warning at all.<p>A few stats: in the five years I've been an Associate, I've generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales for Amazon. (Tried to get an exact number, but my Associates account is closed, and historical data isn't working properly.) My referral commissions are typically $500-600 a month, with seasonal spikes as large as $1,200.<p>This is a good lesson in counterparty risk - if my business was based primarily on Amazon Associates, I'd be totally screwed.<p>Here's the full text of the e-mail:<p>====================================<p>Dear Colorado-based Amazon Associate:<p>We are writing from the Amazon Associates Program to inform you that the Colorado government recently enacted a law to impose sales tax regulations on online retailers. The regulations are burdensome and no other state has similar rules. The new regulations do not require online retailers to collect sales tax. Instead, they are clearly intended to increase the compliance burden to a point where online retailers will be induced to ""voluntarily"" collect Colorado sales tax -- a course we won't take.<p>We and many others strongly opposed this legislation, known as HB 10-1193, but it was enacted anyway. Regrettably, as a result of the new law, we have decided to stop advertising through Associates based in Colorado. We plan to continue to sell to Colorado residents, however, and will advertise through other channels, including through Associates based in other states.<p>There is a right way for Colorado to pursue its revenue goals, but this new law is a wrong way. As we repeatedly communicated to Colorado legislators, including those who sponsored and supported the new law, we are not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitutionally-permissible system applied even-handedly. The US Supreme Court has defined what would be constitutional, and if Colorado would repeal the current law or follow the constitutional approach to collection, we would welcome the opportunity to reinstate Colorado-based Associates.<p>You may express your views of Colorado's new law to members of the General Assembly and to Governor Ritter, who signed the bill.<p>Your Associates account has been closed as of March 8, 2010, and we will no longer pay advertising fees for customers you refer to Amazon.com after that date. Please be assured that all qualifying advertising fees earned prior to March 8, 2010, will be processed and paid in accordance with our regular payment schedule. Based on your account closure date of March 8, any final payments will be paid by May 31, 2010.<p>We have enjoyed working with you and other Colorado-based participants in the Amazon Associates Program, and wish you all the best in your future.<p>Best Regards,<p>The Amazon Associates Team",1268074561

1175931,comment,1175531,1175531,0,0,mainland,,,"As much as I like Python, Guido has repeatedly demonstrated a pretty fundamental lack of understanding when it comes to functional programming concepts (I'm thinking in particular of past HN discussions regarding his confusion about the difference between tail calls and tail recursion). While it's entirely appropriate to take the stance that Python should not become ""more functional"" (whatever that means), it's not appropriate to do so without a clear understanding of what you're talking about.<p>For the record, here's a link to the Haskell Prelude version of reduce, aka, foldr. Looks like ""a few lines"" to me...<p><a href=""http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.0/src/GHC-Base.html#foldr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base-4.2.0...</a>",1268071916

We're both daily HN readers and would like to use this as a starting point to show Vagrant to the public. Specifically, I'd like to open up to any questions and feedback, so that the HN community can get to know Vagrant. Your feedback is extremely valued. Thanks!<p>A bit of background on this project: I work at a development company (citrusbyte.com) in LA. I see new projects almost every couple months, and I'm often working on multiple projects simultaneously due to work, freelance, and personal projects. Managing the development environments between many projects on a local machine became a huge burden and a coworker once mentioned developing in a virtual machine. I thought this was a great idea, and Vagrant was eventually born from it.<p>Like I said before, feel free to ask any questions. If no questions, I value your feedback very highly, so please let me know what you think!<p>Thanks,\nMitchell",1268071915

The antibacterial measures we apply externally (rather than internally) tend to be more of the ""would kill anything living"" variety than the ""targets specific, removable weakness of this organism"".  Hence, hard to adapt to.<p>Hand sanitizers, for example, work by immersing bacteria in alcohol, a potent organic solvent.  It dissolves cell membranes and denatures proteins.<p>While there are bugs that can live in some pretty harsh conditions, to my mind, worrying about the bacteria in your kitchen sink spontaneously developing resistance to alcohol is like worrying about them spontaneously developing resistance to boiling water.<p>Possible, on the millions-of-years scale.

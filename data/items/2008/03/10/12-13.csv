133100,comment,132747,132833,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I think this is just toy-example syndrome. In my experience the real-world example looks more like this:<p><pre><code>  f(X) ->\n    X1 = foo(X, ""Blah blah blah"", true, :definitely, :ack),\n    X2 = fab(X1, X, sizeof(X), X-1, bar(X, ""martini""), :with_bells_on, :pdq),\n    X3 = bar(X2, ""fim tim lim bim whim bim bus stop""),\n    baz(X3).\n</code></pre>\nTry chaining <i>that</i> and see how readable it is.",1205153660

You can even be more consice by using point-free form:<p><pre><code>  f = baz . bar . fab . foo\n</code></pre>\n[Haskell syntax - sorry, I do not know enough about Erlang - but something like this should be possible.]",1205152778

133093,comment,133055,133083,0,0,DarrenStuart,,,"being a .net contractor myself I have to agree and then disagree.<p>The most day coders I have come across are in the .net field but as I work in this field I don't know if this is true. I suspect java has its fair share of day coders.<p>However I have met a lot of really good coders who use .net as a tool that has been given to them to use.<p>I don't want to get into a flamewar but the article did make me wonder if most developers view .net developers as lesser developers because of their chosen toolset. Does this have more to do with the hate of MS or do they really believe it.<p>From a knowledge point of view .net requries a lot more traditional programming skills than ruby ever does. I bet .net developers don't look down on ruby developers in the same way.",1205152148

But it is an interesting observation, to me, because he's mostly right, based on quantities.<p>Good luck collecting enough poppy seeds. Same deal on the coca leaves, but try eating a mouthful. Same deal there on tobacco. The same logic applies to caffeine, chocolate, and alcohol. The drug is extremely weak in it's natural form so it requires a decent amount of work to get something really psychoactive.<p>To him, you can simply pull a marijuana bud off a plant, like an apple from a tree, and eat it for the full effect. That's quite a contrast.<p>Psilocybin and peyote apply but I don't think he's ever had the opportunity, especially since they don't grow like a weed.<p>His point: Nature has done a pretty remarkable job providing for our physical and mental health.

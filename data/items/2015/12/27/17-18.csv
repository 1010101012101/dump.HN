There must be other algos out there that are more plausible as explanations for what humans (and animals) use?<p>Well that&#x27;s the thing, it&#x27;s a bit of a philosophical paradox/conundrum actually :)<p>See, you can subtly tweak these images up to the point where an artificial neural network is <i>really</i> sure that it&#x27;s a vulture and not a panda. It scores real high on &quot;vulture&quot;, not just slightly over the threshold, it&#x27;s possibly to push it far into &quot;most definitely a vulture&quot; score.<p>And--someone correct me if I&#x27;m wrong--I think I remember from other research that if you tweak an image into another category using the gradients of one neural net, it <i>still</i> scores very high on that other category if you try to classify it with a different neural net.<p>While our own biological neural network ... well, as you look at the image, you&#x27;re <i>really</i> sure that it&#x27;s a panda and not a vulture.<p>Now imagine the opposite. Let&#x27;s assume we <i>can</i> fool our own biological neural networks in a similar manner. What would this experience be like?<p>Imagine you observe an image that to your eyes (or visual cortex) most <i>definitely</i> looks like a panda. Except it &quot;actually&quot;, &quot;really&quot; is a picture of a vulture.<p>The question then becomes, if it looks like a panda to our biological/human neural networks, who or what is the authority that can say &quot;no you are mistaken, this is <i>actually</i> a picture of a vulture, it just seems like a panda to your brain&quot;?<p>Because it will fool human neural networks, most people will agree &quot;yup looks like a panda to me&quot;.<p>So if all the humans are wrong, who gets to say what it &quot;really&quot; is a picture of? Maybe an artificial neural network? :-) Because we already have one of those. It&#x27;s in the article. There&#x27;s that picture that to our puny mistaken human neural nets definitely looks like a panda. But the artificial neural net in the article sees the &quot;really real truth&quot; and tells us that no, it <i>really</i> is a picture of a vulture, really, with mathematical certainty.

I was studying games, AI, and supercomputing back then. Their Octane workstations with dual 200MHz MIPS plus innovative graphics were totally smoking nearly GHz Intel rigs. The NUMAlinks on Origin were giving 100+GB of RAM, dozens of CPU&#x27;s, and GB/s bandwidth at microsecond latencies. They threw a room full of Onyx2 NUMA&#x27;s together to blow our minds with [the graphics of] Final Fantasy. They later put FPGA&#x27;s (&quot;RASC&quot;) on NUMAlink in Altix machines to show what FPGA&#x27;s could <i>really do</i> as accelerators if PCI bottleneck wasn&#x27;t there. Anything those people did was mind-blowing for a time.<p>Their legacy lives on in XFS, the NUMA extensions to Linux, that mainstream graphics adopted similar interconnect strategy, and that Intel&#x27;s about to one-up their FPGA scheme with Altera acquisition. Not a bad list. I want them to spin off an older NUMAlink chip as a commodity for building x86 NUMA&#x27;s. I still want me a MPP system with single-system image and hundreds of GB RAM on the cheap.

Just too little memory. However, people doing things that aren&#x27;t memory intensively, esp embedded, might be fine with a fraction of Pi&#x27;s resources.

Wrote a long detailed tutorial and let the students self-pace, with a bit of an intro at the start of most classes. Then the TA and I jumped in to help when students needed it, mostly by looking over their shoulders - I like the post-it idea.<p>A couple of issues with this approach:<p>- Make sure your material is good. Bugs in the material led to me repeating myself 1:1 a lot, and having to pause the class occasionally. Which leads to:<p>- Pausing the class is hard! People are at different stages of the material, so it&#x27;s hard to find a good stopping point, though I did it a few times when something was either not resonating, or folks were going too fast and I sensed they were copy-pasting rather than fully understanding the point.<p>- The solution to this is to have &#x27;core&#x27; material and then &#x27;extra credit&#x27; stuff, but people feel behind if they haven&#x27;t done <i>all</i> the material; nobody&#x27;s happy only doing the core. In general, fear of &quot;not keeping up&quot; was a big issue in my class.<p>- Finally, some folks do learn differently, and you have to account for that. I spent a lot of time 1:1 with a couple particular students who weren&#x27;t getting the tutorial format. Another felt like class was just &quot;doing homework&quot; and dropped out. I got around this by sending videos in a flipped-classroom approach between classes, but my students didn&#x27;t have a lot of spare time and I couldn&#x27;t rely on them doing anything outside class.",1451238559

Fast forward 30 years to today and the landscaper that works on the houses where I live still complains about how hard it is to find good employees.<p>2. Cannery or commercial fishing work in Alaska. I did this several summers during college (this was back when programming internships, or really any internships, were not as common today). You can work long, hard, hours in peak season but, since you won&#x27;t be doing anything else, during a good season you can earn a fair amount of cash just by the sheer number of overtime hours worked. If the season is bad then you might not get much work and that is a risk. Besides that, you will certainly meet some interesting people and Alaska is quite beautiful.<p>You have many avenues these days where you can learn and prove your skills in a variety of fields, not just programming but ever more so if you go that route, but you do have to follow through.

This is different than the first few generations where the electric motor assisted a regular old dinosaur burner in day-to-day -- now the gas engines kick in to either extend range or augment the electric motors, but that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s bumped efficiency up a ton and seems to have dropped prices quite a bit as the drivetrains end up with fewer big complicated moving parts.<p>My current car is a 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid..it&#x27;s described as a CVT, but actually isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s an electric car with a clutch that engages an oversized generator/engine when it needs more kick. In stop and go city driving, this arrangement is actually more efficient than highway driving and I&#x27;ve gotten north of 50mpg pretty regularly. Range on 15 gallons of gas is ~650 miles...the car is bigger than a Prius, looks more like a normal car and drives fantastically (since Honda trickled down Acura tech into the suspension system to account for the increased weight and the electric and gas motors combined make the car pretty fast for a family sedan). The only sad thing is that Honda is skipping 2016 for this car and won&#x27;t produce it until a complete redesign probably in 2017. All told, $25k for the car off the lot and I was able to get a few grand for my old car meaning I paid only slightly over $20k for this tech.<p>From talking to Volt owners, they have a slightly superior experience in terms of the car having more of a bias towards being electric.

I spend the first few classes focused on spreadsheets -- including formulas and pivot tables.<p>After that, I go full on into SQL. This was initially motivated by the fact that SQL is a pretty important skill, and it is one of the most succinct ways to describe the concept of computationally joining two datasets to find interesting insights...which is basically the core of journalism (e.g. a list of names of business owners and a list of names of political campaign contributors)...but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s a great way to teach computing in general. For most of these students who have never programmed, SQL is the first time that they&#x27;ve had to tell a computer exactly what they want. For example, I used to think it was a pain to have to specify every column you want to see with a `SELECT` statement...but this is in perfect contrast with how Excel works. The latter by default shows everything, and this has implications with not just computer performance and dataset size limitations, but in data <i>filtering</i>...that is, you&#x27;re forced to see all the data columns at once, even if it&#x27;s far too much to consume. With SQL, it&#x27;s about knowing exactly what you want to see and telling the computer to do it exactly the way you want.<p>On the teaching side, this makes things far easier for me. I no longer have to teach a GUI, which is a long series of me saying &quot;Click here...unless you&#x27;re on PC/on version 2011X/have a window size less than 1024px wide&quot; and writing tedious guides of screenshots. With SQL, I just write SQL. And the exercises can be stated in plain English.<p>For the exams, I basically made them write out a bunch of queries on real-world datasets which I described in plain English...I gave them the expected results, and so they had to write the queries that got the answers. Very easy to grade and very easy to give them help on (they were take home exams):<p>Baby name data: <a href=""http://2015.padjo.org/assignments/midterm-babysteps-sql/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2015.padjo.org/assignments/midterm-babysteps-sql/</a><p>Medicare data: <a href=""http://2015.padjo.org/assignments/midterm-wsj-medicare-walkthrough/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2015.padjo.org/assignments/midterm-wsj-medicare-walkt...</a><p>And to comment on the author&#x27;s experience with the &quot;stereotype threat&quot;, in which students of traditionally minority groups hesitate to speak up because they feel they are being judged by that group, e.g. xkcd #385 <a href=""http://xkcd.com/385/...this"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/385/...this</a> is definitely a phenomenon. Last year I had a nearly all female class and they had no problems at all speaking up/out at me. In elective programming classes with more males, they generally were more reserved.",1451235859

Easy sync of the certificates across devices (as mentioned in the article, allow the user to choose which ones to sync). Most (non-tech-savvy) people still don&#x27;t use password managers, and instead remember or write down passwords. You have to make it easy for these people to use multiple devices without having to jump through hoops. Even private keys protected by a passphrase/password add one more barrier (assuming each user has a separate OS account and is logged in). How would a user setup a new device with a previously setup client certificate? What fallback mechanisms (other than form based user/password auth) would be required for cases where a user wants to use a public computer or a shared computer account?<p>2. Handling the reissue of client side certificates for the expiring/expired ones along with revocation (if/when necessary). I believe this is a huge topic by itself on both the usability and security fronts. What would be the sweet spots for the expiry enforced for a particular site? Six months? One year? Two years? Ten years? Considering that most users in the current form based authentication scheme rarely change passwords, the convenience, or rather, the reduction in annoyance to end users, should be an important consideration.<p>I have seen client side certificates used in corporate environments where the management of these is easier, but even in those cases I have always seen alternatives like form based authentication available, along with other things like NTLM, etc.<p>Please comment/inform if any/what prior work has been done in these areas (I&#x27;m sure many people must have thought about these).",1451235698

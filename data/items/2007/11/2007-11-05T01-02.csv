The other really fun part is standing back and watching others use it. Every time I create something that's truly useful I'm as satisfied as if it was the first time I'd ever done it.",1194227119

All the big web languages run as multiple processes (or threads) and so do all the big databases. I think we'll see a lot more server consolidation, which we're already seeing with the 4-core and 8-core machines of today.

76160,comment,75869,75869,0,0,vlad,,,"I think CakePHP is the new VB since you can easily install VB6 on any Windows computer and make apps for (at the time) 95% of computers (and for Parallels now as well), just like PHP apps run on almost any existing web host.  Also like VB6, CakePHP apps are based on a very simple language (BASIC versus PHP) while Ruby is different in some ways than languages most programmers are familiar with.  Finally, CakePHP and VB6 both evolved from very popular languages used by hundreds of thousands of people for many years (BASIC, QBASIC, regular PHP), while almost nobody used Ruby before Ruby on Rails came along.<p>Finally, on all three points, I'm comparing and contrasting Ruby on Rails.  Ruby itself is nowhere near Visual Basic--QBasic might be a better comparison.",1194226053

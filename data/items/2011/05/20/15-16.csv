Vegetarians, animal rights advocates, and people who may eat meat but nevertheless are against promoting it because of their concern for the environment want to believe that their more moral diet is also healthier. The easy way to do that is by lending their confirmation bias to any scientific study that maligns high fat diets and thus meat eating and to ignore contrary research findings that does not confirm their bias.",1305906772

Easily the only sane comment about aliasing.<p>I am willing to believe that aliases like 'ga' and 'gp' would actually increase productivity if all you did all day long was manipulate a git repository or you had some physical disability in which it was actually difficult to type on a keyboard, but I mean, using my source control tool is such a small piece of the larger initiative I take on day in and day out, that in the end, the extra keystrokes aren't going to have any meaningful impact on the amount of value I add to the projects I work on.<p>There's also the issue with portability. You have to be able to bring those aliases with you anywhere you go.

But let's see if I can remember the precise rule.<p>Given an array <i>arr</i> with length <i>len</i>, you're allowed to create the pointer <i>arr+len</i>.

With copy protection, to mimic ""lending"" some infrastructure needs to be in place to give someone else access rights to a copy of a book while simultaneously depriving you of your copy.

I can't copy/paste from my paper books either, at least not in any way that's not also available to kindle owners.<p>4. Every choice involves trade-offs. There is no morality involved here, much less the sound of jackboots. There is only what people value.

A lot of people get fed up with their weight, resolve to make a change, and then lose a bunch.  Adopting an exciting new idea and making a change is the crucial part, not the validity of the idea.

It's a silly, over-simplified assertion.<p>Also, fats are the most calorie-dense macro-nutrient.  If your calorie intake is greater than your calorie expenditure you will gain weight.  You could easily supplement your diet with a 300 calorie bar of chocolate twice a day and your daily calorie intake skyrockets from 2,000 to 2,600.  Over time this will lead to obesity if your activity level doesn't rise or if muscles don't grow.<p>Each tablespoon of oil adds 100+ calories a the dish.<p>2 slices of bread: 160 calories, 60g of peanut butter: 350 calories.<p>Carbs are good.  You need carbs.  Without carbs, your body overuses ketogenesis for energy, releasing toxic byproducts into the blood that cause kidney and liver damage.<p>Too many carbs at once leads to unstable blood sugar and insulin levels.  The consequences of this are poorly understood, especially in healthy, active people.  But intuitively, daily large spikes in blood sugar and insulin response are probably not a good thing.  The good news is that eating high GI carbs with fiber, protein, fats, and sugars mitigates the spikes.<p>While not as calorie-dense as fatty foods, lots of high carb foods are low fiber, low protein, and low moisture with minimal micronutrients and still have very high calorie/weight ratios.<p>(Calories-in > Calories-out) in a sedentary lifestyle leads to increased body fat and weight gain which leads to cellular stress inflammation causing insulin resistance, which leads to more weight gain and more severe metabolic problems.<p>The whole carb vs. fat debate is a waste of time.",1305905088

On format, why is there a tagline in the middle of a dictionary definition? I can see using a dictionary definition format and I can see using a name and tagline format, but I can't see mixing the two. At first, I started reading it as a name and tagline and wondered why there was a pronunciation guide in the name. Then I realize it was a definition and was confused as to what ""great, recommended audio for the urban commuter"" had to do with the definition. I would drop the tagline altogether unless the design of the page somehow makes it obvious that the tagline and definition are completely separate entities.<p>On the text, please don't take this the wrong way, but it sounds somewhat non-native. I don't think I have ever heard anyone describe something as ""great, recommended."" In fact, if you Google ""great recommended"" in quotes, most of the results are clearly poorly written (like ""what some great recommended psp games""). I feel the same way about ""conveniently enjoys"", which only has 247 results on Google when quoted, including this page.<p>A little restructuring of the text might make it read a little more smoothly as well. Perhaps, ""Busy commuter who enjoys hand-picked audio recommendations from well-informed guides.""<p>Finally, ""audio recommendations"" is vague. What kind of audio do you mean? Music? Poetry? Speeches? Anything and everything? If this is supposed to be clear, I would make it clear in the copy. If it's supposed to be vague, I guess that's OK too, as long as it's deliberate.",1305904655

Now that partially hydrogenated vegetable oil is out of fashion, packaged foods remove it and advertise ""0% Trans Fat!""<p>There was a time when carbs were bad and there were plenty of packaged foods that upped the fat and protein and advertised ""Low Carb!"" When Dr. Atkins died of heart failure and overweight, the steam went out of low-carb. Now low-fat is ascendant, and packaged foods trumpet ""Low Fat!""<p>The problem with this latest fad is fat makes food taste good. When you take it out, recipes taste like crap. Try a spoonful of fat-free cream cheese and tell me what you think. So the packaged food industry has to add something else that makes the low-fat garbage palatable: sugar!<p>It's evil, but it's not a conspiracy. People buy packaged foods because they're convenient and taste ok. They do this in preference to cooking, which may or may not taste better, because they're lazy or too busy. That's human nature. The problem is the low-fat food fad.<p>If the culture turned a corner and demanded low-sugar food, the food industry would fall all over itself taking sugar and corn syrup out and adding back in fat and protein to make the stuff taste better.

For instance, the necessity of the parallel postulate for Euclidian geometry and the existence of non-Euclidean geometries where it doesn't hold were demonstrated in the 19th century.  The question of how many and which axioms are required as the basis of a field of mathematics has long been known to be a valid, meaningful question.<p>What Gdel proved is that in the formal systems we use to model mathematical propositions and proofs, there is no finite number of axioms that enable you to prove or disprove all of the propositions that can be formulated.  For someone who grew up in the post-Gdel world, this isn't shocking at all and looks like a natural progression from previous results.  You need a certain number of postulates.  To get Euclidean geometry, for example, you need the parallel postulate.  It's natural to ask how many postulates you need to decide all interesting mathematical questions, and there's no reason to assume the answer to that question is finite.  Apparently, that attitude reflects a lot of hindsight bias, but there is no way for us to experience the shock of Gdel's work the way it was experienced by mathematicians at the time, since the books we learn from now are written by mathematicians who have already digested Gdel's discoveries.",1305904171

I'm sorry to say this article is poor on information.<p>Let's stick to the facts. Complex carbs (brown rice, whole wheat bread, bagels, whole wheat pasta, beans - the list of delicious, healthy complex carbs is long) in moderation does not hinder your health. In fact, your body needs them because it is stored energy. Other sources of energy are used up quicker, such as protein. That's not to say carbs are better than protein. Your body needs both!<p>Now, refined SIMPLE carbs (table sugar, fruit juice, ""packaged"" cereals, chocolate bars, etc.) are not good for you, and only certain types of bodies with certain physical activity should consume them (e.g., if you are a bodybuilder or if you lift weights a few times a week, etc.). It is still absolutely tantamount that you consume unrefined simple carbs such as strawberries, raspberries, oranges, apples, plum, pear, a long etc., and the number one fruit because of its flavanoid content: blueberries!).<p>Put simply, fruits and complex carbs help you convert what you eat in slow-releasing energy that has less content that is turned into fat (as opposed to refined simple carbs). This steady release of energy is part of ""moderation is key"". If you have your body working too hard, your heart fluttering/palpitations and overworking it are not healthy, neither is when your body processes everything too slow.<p>The biggest factor when consuming carbs (both simple and complex) is the glycemic levels in your blood. You can't have this fluctuate so much, especially if you're pre-disposed to it, otherwise you throw it out of kilter and it may cause diabetes.<p>I'll keep the fat part short. We need fat, too! Let me be less ""headliney"". We need polyunsaturated fatty acids; in part, to keep our metabolism going. Foods like avocado, fish, flax seed, leafy vegetables, soybeans, walnuts (nuts), and shellfish. Sure, saturated fats may not be the major cause of heart disease, but lessening it while consuming a healthy amount of polyunsaturated fat and complex carbs might. You can read an article on that here (it's better than the OP's article, but still has its flaws): <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/rethinking-saturated-fat-its-not-your-hearts-enemy/article1462757/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/rethinking-satura...</a> (By the way, this article was published over a year ago.)<p>Having said all that, each body is different. You should tailor your diet to what your body reacts positively to. For example, flax seed is healthy for you, but I know people who get diarrhea from it. Obviously, don't force yourself to eat something your body doesn't like. Listen to your body, because, unfortunately, the science doesn't fully understand all body types.<p>I'm not a fan of fallacies from defective induction, so I shall refrain from an argumentum ad verecundiam on this, but on a separate note, I will say my friend studied nutrition and she has expressed a keen dislike toward the ""Food guide pyramid"".",1305904163

There is much more worldwide cultural variation in what people eat, and much more individual variation within each culture, among healthy people than there is variation in the exercise level of healthy people. But seeking to change diet to change health sounds easier than getting more exercise, so that's what gets in the news (and on HN, over and over and over).<p>Doing serious scientific research<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>with controlled experiments and careful observation and follow-up on human nutrition is extremely hard. I recall a local television news documentary about a dietary study from the 1970s in which experimental subjects were confined 24/7 in a lab for many weeks (they must have been compensated handsomely to agree to participate in this experiment) and fed EXACT portions of food that were weighed with extreme precision. Oddly, I don't recall particularly what hypothesis that study was set up to test, but I do recall that it was described as the first experiment that relied on feeding subjects exactly measured portions of known foods (and excluding subjects from access to foods they chose for themselves) while involving lengthy (weeks of time) follow-up. It's still exceedingly rare for studies of human nutrition to have careful experimental designs. (And even at that, I suppose most of the subjects of that experiment are still alive, but I don't know if anyone is doing follow-up observations of those subjects in any manner.) Instead, we get inferences from Egyptian mummies (as in the submitted article) or from other uncontrolled case studies that never even had careful observation to begin with.

2567925,story,,,3,5,djjose,"SHOW HN: MobileUserTests.com",,"Hi folks!  As we have been building mobile apps we came across an interesting problem for testing our apps, specifically around usability testing. The process in getting our friends' and people we know UDID's for iOS app testing was cumbersome and the results of the tests weren't great (friends are very unlikely to tell you your app sucks). Getting non-techie people to install a package on their Android phones is also a challenge. And even if you can actually get past all these phases you need to get their feedback somehow (either a phone call or back and forth emails).  Wouldn't it be incredibly helpful if you could actually see what these people were doing when they used your app?  We thought so too.  So we're offering a service to allow companies and devs to have complete strangers test their apps, specifically usability test them.  All you need to do is give us a scenario and list up to 5 tasks you want the user to accomplish with your app.  You'll receive a video of a user using the app performing the tasks you've outlined.<p>I'd love to hear community feedback on this service. Are there features or other things you'd like as part of this service? Is this as painful for you folks as it has been for us?",1305903798

Put it up on github or your own website depending on the product, and include all the url's in the application or email that you send to the company. It will make you stand out and show that you are interested in working on the types of things they work on.<p>All it takes is one open source project gaining momentum to completely change a product space. It's less troublesome/expensive for the company to hire you than it is to try and fight a grassroots opensource movement later on. If you can make a company engineer think that they are getting a deal by hiring you early on, then you are pretty much set.<p>Bonus points: get the sales department to email the engineers for you.",1305903622

In the case of high mpg cars, it is insurance against price shocks. If the petrodollar goes bust, you can still get to your office at a price you can afford, while everyone else scrambles to carpool or buy a high-mpg car.<p>So even if you only break even over the life of the vehicle, you get the potential value of driving to the very end of the Oil Age.",1372607854

Even those might end up being wrapped in a Dalvik VM runtime app to access things like accounts, sharing, etc.<p>A realistic step would be to add one or more JVM languages as first class citizens of the toolchain.

5966073,comment,5965081,5965081,8,0,tokenadult,,,"The submitted article had some interesting tips, and several of the previous comments are quite good too. I&#x27;ve been developing a FAQ on language learning as this interest is mentioned on Hacker News from time to time. As I learned Mandarin Chinese up to the level that I was able to support my family for several years as a Chinese-English translator and interpreter, I had to tackle several problems for which there is not yet a one-stop-shopping software solution. For ANY pair of languages, even closely cognate pairs of West Germanic languages like English and Dutch, or Wu Chinese dialects like those of Shanghai and Suzhou, the two languages differ in sound system, so that what is a phoneme in one language is not a phoneme in the other language.<p><a href=""http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPhoneme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Wha...</a><p>But a speaker of one language who is past the age of puberty will simply not perceive many of the phonemic distinctions in sounds in the target language (the language to be learned) without very careful training, as disregard of those distinctions below the level of conscious attention is part of having the sound system of the speaker&#x27;s native language fully in mind. Attention to target language phonemes has to be developed through pains-taking practice.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032</a><p>It is brutally hard for most people (after the age of puberty, and perhaps especially for males) to learn to attend to sound distinctions that don&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. That is especially hard when the sound distinction signifies a grammatical distinction that also doesn&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. For example, the distinction between &quot;I speak&quot; and &quot;he speaks&quot; in English involves a consonant cluster at the end of a syllable, and no such consonant clusters exist in the Mandarin sound system at all. Worse than that, no such grammatical distinction as &quot;first person singular&quot; and &quot;third person singular&quot; for inflecting verbs exists in Mandarin, so it is remarkably difficult for Mandarin-speaking learners of English to learn to distinguish &quot;speaks&quot; from &quot;speak&quot; and to say &quot;he speaks Chinese&quot; rather than * &quot;he speak Chinese&quot; (not a grammatical phrase in spoken English).<p>Most software materials for learning foreign languages could be much improved simply by including a complete chart of the sound system of the target language (in the dialect form being taught in the software materials) with explicit description of sounds in the terminology of articulatory phonetics<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics</a><p>with full use of notation from the International Phonetic Alphabet.<p><a href=""http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html</a><p>Good language-learning materials always include a lot of focused drills on sound distinctions (contrasting minimal pairs in the language) in the target language, and no software program for language learning should be without those. It is still an art of software writing to try to automate listening to a learner&#x27;s pronunciation for appropriate feedback on accuracy of pronunciation. That is not an easy problem.<p>After phonology, another huge task for any language learner is acquiring vocabulary, and this is the task that most language-learning materials are most focused. But often the focus on vocabulary is not very thoughtful.<p>The classic software approach to helping vocabulary acquisition is essentially to automate flipping flash cards. But flash cards have ALWAYS been overrated for vocabulary acquisition. Words don&#x27;t match one-to-one between languages, not even between closely cognate languages. The map is not the territory, and every language on earth divides the world of lived experience into a different set of words, with different boundaries between words of similar meaning.<p>The royal road to learning vocabulary in a target language is massive exposure to actual texts (dialogs, stories, songs, personal letters, articles, etc.) written or spoken by native speakers of the language. I&#x27;ll quote a master language teacher here, the late John DeFrancis. A few years ago, I reread the section &quot;Suggestions for Study&quot; in the front matter of John DeFrancis&#x27;s book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, &quot;Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ&quot; (capitalization as in original). In other words, vocabulary can only be well acquired in context (an argument he develops in detail with regard to Chinese in the writing I have just cited) and the context must be a genuine context produced by native speakers of the language.<p>I have been giving free advice on language learning since the 1990s on my personal website,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html</a><p>and the one advice I can give every language learner reading this thread is to take advantage of radio broadcasting in your target language. Spoken-word broadcasting (here I&#x27;m especially focusing on radio rather than on TV) gives you an opportunity to listen and to hear words used in context. In the 1970s, I used to have to use an expensive short-wave radio to pick up Chinese-language radio programs in North America. Now we who have Internet access can gain endless listening opportunities from Internet radio stations in dozens of unlikely languages. Listen early and listen often while learning a language. That will help with phonology (as above) and it will help crucially with vocabulary.<p>The third big task of a language learner is learning grammar and syntax, which is often woefully neglected in software language-learning materials. Every language has hundreds of tacit grammar rules, many of which are not known explicitly even to native speakers, but which reveal a language-learner as a foreigner when the rules are broken. The foreign language-learner needs to understand grammar not just to produce speech or writing that is less jarring and foreign to native speakers, but also to better understand what native speakers are speaking or writing. Any widely spoken modern language has thick books reporting the grammatical rules of the language,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-Grammar/dp/0520066103/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars/dp/0415150329/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0582517346/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/...</a><p>and it is well worth your while to study books like that both about your native language(s) and about any language you are studying.",1372606282

While one could learn a number of techniques for drawing and painting online, none of these make students into better artists, only better drawers or painters. Being technically better than your peers has some merit, but will not get you very far in the artistic community if the meaning of a piece is not conveyed well.<p>I think the primary mistake that the author makes is boiling art down into a collection of techniques. With this view they can easily argue that each of these techniques can be easily learned and replicated through online education. No reasonable artist would go to RISD and pay that much just to learn better techniques. If they wanted to do that they could just stay home and watch Bob Ross. Instead they to work with and be taught by the very good artists and students. And its these connections that make a RISD education worth 245k.<p>But to come to some kind of conclusion, art is not just a skill, at a very low level stops being about the artists technique and about its meaning, or communicative properties.

To answer (I tend towards the loquacious, so forgive me):
> * Why YUI? When I think of YUI, I tend to think &quot;overkill&quot;. Obviously you&#x27;ve done a ton of work on this since 2009; is there anything you couldn&#x27;t have accomplished building this on top of jQuery (just as an example)?<p>We get this question alot :) We (Liferay) actually were based on jQuery from 2006-2009. We had even hired Paul Bakaus full time in sponsoring jQuery UI, Eduardo was also a contributor (and I had done a website design for the jQuery website around early 2007), so we were pretty big fans (and still are to be honest).<p>Our biggest frustration was mainly with the slow progress in building components with jQuery UI. There were at the time a  lot of components missing. We looked at a couple of different libraries (dojo, Sencha/ExtJS, etc), but we also looked at YUI3, which was in developer preview at the time, and the thing that impressed us was the Widget layer, the much easier DOM/event layer and the lazy loading capabilities built in. The YUI team itself, and their long history of awesome documentation, involvement with their users, and their plans for YUI3 also influenced our decision.<p>To your question specifically though, what we loved about YUI3 was just how lightweight you could go. Basically, the seed file itself is ridiculously small, so if you only need a piece or two of functionality, you don&#x27;t need to run a giant library.
In Liferay, we have an environment that is run normally in enterprises, but it&#x27;s used for everything from public facing websites, to intranets, etc. An installation can have any number of applications with their own set of dependencies, so we wanted a library that we could easily scale in each direction.
Also, we had situations such as third party developers wanted to run different plugins that shared the same name (for instance, sortable). YUI3 has built in sandboxing, so you could have two instances running different modules with the same name, co-existing on the same page.<p>The thing I think YUI doesn&#x27;t get nearly enough credit for is their lazy loading and combo loader. There are a lot of lazy loaders out there (requirejs, labjs, etc), but the thing that has frustrated me has been the fact that for production, you&#x27;re encouraged to run a build script for production to combine all of the files.
However, in our platform, we have multiple apps that may or may not be on the page, plus plenty of dynamic pages that may or may not be visible depending on permissions, etc.
So we had situations where we had to keep adding modules to a growing public seed file for plugins that might only be visible to 10% of users.
YUI&#x27;s loader instead analyzes what modules are already on the page, and fires off a single request for the rest of the modules it doesn&#x27;t have.<p>There are things I miss from jQuery (I really do think it&#x27;s DOM/Event API are the simplest and best around), but ultimately, there are always those tradeoffs around complexity, performance, and developer power that need to be weighed.<p>> * Does AlloyUI play well with others? For instance, if I wanted to incorporate one or two of your widgets in a UI built on top of Bootstrap or Foundation, would I run into trouble? What of MV* frameworks (Ember, Angular, etc.), or just plain-vanella jQuery?<p>As an FYI, AlloyUI 2.0 is actually built on Bootstrap as well (for the markup/CSS portion, not the JS :) - our modules use Bootstrap markup and CSS).
So you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with running Bootstrap. I&#x27;m not sure how compatible Bootstrap and Foundation are (personally, not a big fan of Foundation&#x27;s presentational class name&#x27;s such as &quot;radius&quot; and &quot;round&quot;, so I don&#x27;t play around with it much).<p>JavaScript-wise, all of our modules are segmented and only attached to a YUI instance, so there won&#x27;t be any conflict between us and any other library (we don&#x27;t create globals, we don&#x27;t modify host object, etc).<p>The only problem we&#x27;ve ever run into is when people want to run Prototype or some similar library where they&#x27;re modifying the host objects, and it causes our modules to break. But if we had to, we could still get around it.<p>> * Testing this out on an iPad I found that some widgets seem to work well (calendar), but others (photo crop) not so much. Do you intend to target touch devices?<p>Touch is something we&#x27;re actively working on improving. YUI has a lot of great built in stuff around touch, but our ultimate goal is to optimize the interaction of the individual modules for the specific devices (which is where the YUI loader comes in handy, because we can selectively load JS modules depending on the device/browser).<p>> * You have a code editor, and a toolbar that seems intended for a rich text editor, but I don&#x27;t see a rich text editor included. Do you have plans to add a rich text editor? Especially because YUI3&#x27;s rich text editor is very limited out of the box, this would seem to be a great addition.<p>Within Liferay, we actually have done a lot of work around the rich text editor, because we have been wanting to use it for a long time to replace our use of CKEditor.
However, after a lot of work on it, we realized that it&#x27;s not quite ready for what we wanted.
It&#x27;s amazing for a basic editor, but we wanted to add inline contenteditable support, improve the accessibility, etc.
We ended up using CKEditor 4, since it had all of the stuff we wanted built in (and the performance and UI was much improved). Building a decent rich text editor that is supported cross-browser and accessible seems like an easy task to talk about, but it&#x27;s pretty herculean and requires someone focused on it full time.<p>We are planning on submitting our existing improvements to YUI, but depending on their plans for it, I&#x27;m not sure when it will make it in.
Long term, though, we are interested in building out the YUI3 editor to being a contender.<p>Hopefully that helps answer more questions than it raises, but if it does raise more questions, feel free to ask away :)",1372605355

5966008,comment,5965367,5965753,2,0,greghinch,,,"YUI gets a bad rap because of YUI2. YUI3 was a ground-up rewrite that addressed all of the overkill from 2 and them built an awesome library that includes things like modules and models/views, as well as things you expect like DOM, really great custom events, animation, etc. It&#x27;s a really great foundation when you are building a complex JS-driven application UI. Having worked in front-end development since before there were JS libraries, I almost never choose anything else. JQuery has a lot of the same stuff now via 3rd party libraries, but often I&#x27;ve seen the production schedules of those various 3rd parties lead to cases where you need a newer version of one but can&#x27;t upgrade because it would interfere with another.<p>YUI3 also forces you to use at least the basics of good coding patterns and practices, where jQuery gives you nothing in that regard. My experience with the average designer/pseudo-developer person who is writing JavaScript is that they can use a bit of handholding when it comes to crafting maintainable code on projects.",1372604915

    the U.S. government—or any other government—direct 
    access to our servers. Indeed, the U.S. government does 
    not have direct access or a “back door” to the   
    information stored in our data centers. We had not 
    heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday.
</code></pre>
So they did not hear of the NSA codename for FBI operated equipment. ( And note that they do not deny wiretapping, just &#x27;direct access&#x27; and &#x27;back door.&#x27;)<p><pre><code>    Second, we provide user data to governments only in 
    accordance with the law. [...] Press reports that 
    suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to
    our users’ data are false, period.
</code></pre>
That seems to indicate that here Google defines &#x27;provide user data&#x27; as a specific database access. Which seems to be reinforced by<p><pre><code>    Until this week’s reports, we had never heard of the broad 
    type of order that Verizon received—an order that appears 
    to have required them to hand over millions of users’ 
    call records.
</code></pre>
Note they talk about records, not about live interception. ( And the order against Verizon seems than to indicate that Verizon did not participate in live wire tapping.)<p>IMHO, this points in the direction, that there is FBI equipment in the Google datacenters. This equipment is tapping into the network connections and pipes them to the NSA. So the Guardians allegations [2] that<p><pre><code>    &quot;Collection directly from the servers of these US service 
    providers: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL,
    Skype, YouTube, Apple.&quot; 
</code></pre>
means that there is nothing between the servers and the wiretapping equipment. While the companies take the view, that only a account on a database server constitutes &#x27;direct access.&#x27;<p>[1]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5841228"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5841228</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/07/google-facebook-prism-surveillance-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/07/google-facebook-...</a>",1372604506

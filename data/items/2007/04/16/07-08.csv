If they had written an (optional) java interface and really pushed the ""no gps, but free"" angle, I really think they would have had a strong hand to play.  <p>As they are now, they seem to have been stagnant for a long time. When I was trying to enter the space against them I always assumed it was because they had a big play coming down the pipes, but I see now they just failed. <p>I also don't have a lot of sympathy for those guys, those two alone should have been enough to engineer the product they needed. From the outside looking in, it seems like they had more than enough time, and they wasted it being complacent. \n",1176707812

Then they give up and start doing totally different things. Doesn't seem like the  dogged determination of visionaries to me.<p>I suspect they realized how little incentive there is for them to bust their asses pushing the product through Google bureaucracy, and that no one was pulling for them, so they quit.\n",1176707548

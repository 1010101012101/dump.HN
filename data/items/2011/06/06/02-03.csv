2623522,comment,2623182,2623182,5,0,msort,,,"Great writing.<p>One issue with ""Forward exercise"" tough: by forward-exercising and converting to ""Restricted Stock Unit"", you avoid the high tax risk, but you also need to pay a substantial amount of cash in advance and bet on the future value of the company. Let's say you get $10k options at strike price $20, you basically need to pay $200K in advance to forward exercise. If the company dies in the future without anexit, you basically lose your $200k.<p>So perhaps the best strategy is to:\n1) Forward exercise in several batches as you are gaining confidence of the company (but before the world has much confidence of the company...yet), and try to exercise before the next valuation increase.<p>2) Delay exercise as late as possible (closer to exit or IPO). But this usually works only if you join a late-stage startup, whose fate is more predictable.<p>If you are a startup, try issue Restricted Stock Units, rather than Stock Options to poor and hard-working employees. That will make your company more employee-friendly.<p>If you are looking for a startup to join, prefer those who issue Stock Units (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, which are not necessarily startups anymore though).",1307329086

For example, passing in 0 when a parameter expects a int64_t, is the same error. It is useful to know that float is promoted to double in va_arg functions and int8_t, int16_t, and bool are promoted to int32_t.<p>This often causes problems with people new to C using GObject's g_object_set() and g_object_get() functions.",1307328350

2623484,comment,2622902,2622902,3,0,hakunin,,,"Instead of focusing on how (not) useful automated tests are, we need to admit one thing. They are often a daunting time sink, for whichever reason. You can make them habitual, but it's hard to sustainably enjoy writing them. You wish they took less time and gave more benefit. I bet if that was the case, we wouldn't have so many debates on whether tests are needed.<p>In the recent story about human-powered airplanes they finally came up with the right question: ""How can we make the flying machine easy to fix when it crashes?"". Imo, here we need to ask the right question as well: How can we minimize the time consumed by test-writing while maximizing their usefullness? Maybe we should drop the practice of 1 assertion per test, or the notion that tests are also documentation. Maybe we should embrace integration tests. Maybe not. Maybe we should strip all the cruft around the point of tests ""it helps you think, it documents your code, it leads to better design"" and get back to the roots. Tests are there to make sure that critical parts of your code keep working. That's it. It's better that we sustainably write useful occasional tests for critical code than lie to ourselves about how disciplined we are, burn out, and condemn the whole thing.",1307328265

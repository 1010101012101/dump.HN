Someday, somewhere, something incredible will emerge for the right-brained bourgeoisie and literati.\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t see it ever happening: because the bar of expectations rises at the same rate at which the tools improve.<p>For example, think about what the NYTimes website looked like in February 2000:<p><pre><code>   http://web.archive.org/web/19990202013312/http://www3.nytimes.com/\n</code></pre>\nThat probably took millions of dollars and a team of engineers back in the 2000. In 2015, a reasonably computer-literate person could do something close to that with SquareSpace or Wordpress.com in probably.... a week?[1]<p>But that site would never pass muster in 2015.

9701955,comment,9698870,9701504,0,0,GuiA,,,"> Grade school teachers aren&#x27;t expected to be specialists in the field they teach. They&#x27;re expected to be specialists in teaching.<p>Yeah, and this breaks down pretty fast, particularly when it comes to teaching the stuff you can&#x27;t easily hand wave, e.g. science. Even at the middle/high school level, where teachers are supposed to have studied topic they teach at the undergraduate level in some capacity, you find plenty of foreign language teachers who are terrible speakers of the language they teach, or math teachers who basically have the same level of math as their students, with the distinction that they have access to the answers for the exercises they give. I spent some time in a US state university for grad school, and the level of some students who majored in education and later went on to teach was abysmal. It&#x27;s hard to tell if the hegemony of standardized testing is the root or a symptom of the problem, but the overall picture is bleak.<p>This is precisely why if we want a great education system, we need to incentivize people who are practicing professionals first to then go teach. My best teachers in high school all shared those traits: a historian who had spent many years doing field research teaching history/geography, a geologist who was also a researcher for a major lab teaching natural sciences, etc.<p>Not everyone is made for teaching, but we as a society need to become much better at encouraging and enabling the people who enjoy it to teach in parallel to their professional activity (I would happily teach math from 8-10am before my day job 2-3 days a week if there was the structure for it.).<p>The people who want to become teachers just because they like kids but don&#x27;t have any deep knowledge/understanding of any particular subject can teach kindergarten.",1434052703

9701889,story,,,4,2,amatic,"Show HN: Alternative to inverse kinematics (?)",,"Hi HN,<p>This was my M.A. thesis, and I would appreciate some feedback from HN. It is a robot arm with a visual system. It did a tracking task - looking at a computer screen, following a red dot by moving a mouse.<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ6FGeSjN9c<p>The interesting thing is it doesn&#x27;t use traditional inverse kinematics, instead there are multiple cascades of feedback loops, no internal models.<p>First level are just standard position control loops, just like any servo.<p>Second level loops are controlling relationships between arm points, they operate in parallel, simultaneously. For example - one of the loops maintains distance from fingertip to base (reach), and another one maintains the height from the fingertip to the surface. If the setpoint for reach changes, then the arm will start extending the elbow. That will disturb the height control system, and it will compensate to maintain its setpoint.<p>Third level is the visual system, it was used to maintain distance of cursor marker to target marker. If the target moves up, then the control system maintaining vertical distance sets a new setpoint for the height control system, which sets the shoulder servo to move, and that disturbs the reach system which then starts the elbow servo and so on.<p>It is actually an M.A. in psychology, on theories of motor control, testing perceptual control theory. It was very low budget and my mechanics skills are not yet polished. Hopefully, next one will be better. I was gonna record it doing the tracking task, but a couple of gears broke, and now I need to replace the gearbox.<p>Anyway.. anyone here read about perceptual control theory? There are some interesting simulations of arms with 14 degrees of freedom, also not using traditional inverse kinematics. I&#x27;m kinda weirder out by the lack of people who have heard about the theory, it&#x27;s been around for quite a while, and seems like a pretty interesting approach.",1434052138

This was followed by a list of 10 items consisting of the following: 1.fruits and vegetables of all kinds, including fresh, canned, frozen, cooked, raw, and juices; 2. yogurt, 3. kefir, or food or beverages that contain yogurt; 4. soy milk, or foods or beverages that contain soy milk; 4. miso soup; 5. sauerkraut; 6. dark chocolate; 7. juices that contain microalgae; 8. pickles; 9. tempeh; and 10. kimchi. Participants were asked to indicate how often they consume each of the foods using the following 7-point scale: 1 (never); 2 (1–3 times in the past month); 3 (1–3 times per week); 4 (1–3 times per day); 5 (3–5 times per day); 6 (5–7 times per day); and 7 (more than 8 times per day). Scores were converted to monthly frequencies of 0, 2, 8, 60, 120, 180, and 240, respectively.<p>And the Conclusion:<p>> This study provides the first connection between natural fermented food consumption patterns and anxiety. Increased consumption of fermented foods likely to contain probiotics was associated with fewer social anxiety symptoms. This effect was qualified by an interaction with neuroticism; those who were highly neurotic showed fewer symptoms of social anxiety with greater consumption of fermented foods. Also of note, increased frequency of exercise was associated with decreased social anxiety. Taken together with the results of previous preclinical and clinical studies (Rao et al., 2009, Silk et al., 2009, Messaoudi et al., 2011 and Tillisch et al., 2013), the current results suggest that fermented foods likely to contain probiotics may have a protective effect against social anxiety symptoms for those at higher genetic risk, as indexed by trait neuroticism. While a follow-up prospective cohort study or clinical trial is necessary to determine the direction of causality, these results suggest a possible clinical benefit of fermented foods, a low-risk intervention, on social anxiety.",1434052128

The National Park system was founded with a mission to preserve the serenity of our land, and to give its visitors an opportunity to experience solitude.<p>But Yosemite Village is a lot like a city today. Unless you get more than a day&#x27;s hike away from the valley floor, there&#x27;s no hope of finding solitude or serenity. The Merced, with all its plastic rafts and floaties, looks more like a waterpark than a river. And the campgrounds have more RVs than tents, jammed so close together you can&#x27;t breathe.<p>When a guy in a wingsuit is whipping through the valley at 100mph, whooping and hollering, it really is incongruous with the park&#x27;s mission. As is drone flying, mountain biking, snowmobiling, graffiti-art, and lots of other things that disturb nature.<p>What would John Muir have thought about BASE jumping?<p>My feeling is that the restriction should be lifted, probably because it&#x27;s doing more harm than good, but I think both sides of the argument are convincing, and it&#x27;s unfair to point the finger at the NPS without trying to honestly understand their motivations.

It has motion and tracking sensors. What the rift wants to achieve is the latency from input (moving your head) to photon to be really really low. This problem is hard. And to solve it you need to create your own solutions first. In an ideal world everyone would work together to make the best &quot;Rift&quot; that works on all devices, but that is not how capitalism works. This does not mean that we will not see this in the future. Some companies will win the VR battle, and they will probably be the ones to provide the best HMD for multiple devices. Hopefully we will go to a world where we have a HMD standard, but that is just not how new technologies evolve.<p>2. The Rift is lightweight, and people who have tried the Rift don&#x27;t even notice the HMD on their head after a couple of minutes.<p>3.

Back then a lot of compilers were written in assembler, so it wasn&#x27;t such an unusual starting point - I assume I was drawing inspiration from e.g. PDQ (a public domain Pascal implementation for the Amiga) and others that I think I would have seen first.<p>I started basically by having the compiler do <i>very</i> basic parsing of M68k assembler and just pass everything that looked like assembler straight through.<p>Then I added support for defining functions, but all the content of functions was still assembler. Then I started adding expression support and things like local variable and types.<p>I wish I still had the source (lost in a move, long after I stopped doing anything on it) - one of the fun things about it was that I kept the ability to intersperse assembler instructions everywhere - they were treated as normal statements. And the M68k registers were first class variables in the language that could occur in any expression. So e.g. you could write &quot;D0.w = D1.w + a&quot;, where D0.w would refer to the low 16 bits of the D0 register, and D1.w the low 16 bits of the D1 register, and &quot;a&quot; would be a variable allocated on the stack.<p>Basically the features I added were largely guided by what seemed like it&#x27;d let me shave more lines off the compiler itself...<p>You learn a lot about the language you&#x27;re writing when you bootstrap from asm or try to condence everything into a tiny core - a lot dependencies in the language that are non-obvious becomes a lot clearer.",1434051464

It seems that this name is pretty much synonymous with the city plus a bit of surrounding area, and the upstate regions are completely forgotten. In particular, the areas that have to host NYC&#x27;s water supply get particularly hosed: their economies are significantly based on tourism and fishing, but the flow of the Upper Delaware is entirely governed by NYC needs, ignoring the fish. Further, the State has banned fracking, largely in order to guarantee the integrity of the reservoirs, and at the expense of the only opportunity that those living on the Marcellus Shale have to escape their rut.<p>Counterexample #2 - Austin, TX. Again relating to water, it seems that the city gets priority access to water (a scarce commodity in much of TX). Lake Travis and Lake Buchanan were sacrificed, emptying to something around 30% capacity (I forget the exact numbers) until our recent floods, so that Ladybird Lake (the center of the city) could be kept beautiful and full - and they&#x27;re even talking about building a water park.

And again, this is a display not unlike a 4K display and should work similarly universally, I would think/hope.<p>2. It seem too big to me to be truly immersive.  To lose oneself you have to not notice you are wearing this, which at its current size seems unlikely.<p>3.  It needs to be wireless, any cables will detract from the immersive experience. I&#x27;m sure they are working on this.<p>4.  The controllers they created look pretty interesting but I don&#x27;t see how they will be conducive to touching, picking up, grasping items which would seem to be a more important thing than re-inventing FPS controllers if VR is truly going to take off this time.<p>5.  I worry that too much focus is being placed on adapting FPS to this (and other) VR tech. While it would seem a &#x27;natural&#x27;, and probably will prove to be the easiest style of game to adapt, it&#x27;s also lazy.  It will be far more challenging (and I think rewarding) to adapt VR for other purposes such as viewing live events (concerts, sports etc), driving games/sims, sports games/sims and action adventure games such as Witcher and Dark Souls, just to name a few off my head. Maybe the new controllers will work great with those types of games/activities but my gut is these are really optimized for FPS, which is a shame.<p>It&#x27;s exciting times for VR but I sure hope it doesn&#x27;t get overtaken by FPS games because there are so many more potentially awesome applications out there to also focus on.",1434050520

It&#x27;s not determined by a simple roll of the dice.<p>In some insects the female is able to select gender specifically by fertilising the egg with sperm or withholding it.<p>In others, it seems that it has to do with ambient temperature, abundance of food, etc. If there are enough resources to make a large offspring, the most optimal one is produced that can benefit by being largest. In turtles it&#x27;s a female, in crocodiles a male is produced (IIRC).<p>Anyway, in humans, higher rankers typically have male offspring. Apparently American presidents have had a disproportionately large number of sons. Poorer families typically desire - and apparently some studies indicate produce - more girls. This can again be explained by what is most optimal. It&#x27;s more common in human societies for males to inherit rank, whereas women can marry into it. So poorer families in some cultures bequeath more wealth to women for dowries so they can try to buy their way into higher classes.

I agree it stretches the definition pretty thin: where&#x27;s the control flow? Conditionals?, but are those things really foundational characteristics of programming languages or are they simply the equivalent &#x27;predefined tools&#x27; that, say, C gives us?<p>Excel is much closer to traditional programming: it&#x27;s basically a purely functional language (absent VBA), but instead of a linear description of the program in a text file, you&#x27;re in effect embedding functional code inside a virtual machine&#x27;s memory.<p>EDIT: I suppose an important question about Photoshop is, can you do computation in it?",1434049223

I can imagine this would not be possible with just the internals of the controller.<p>-The ring acts as a sort of extra handle. Imagine opening your hand totally (as in waving).

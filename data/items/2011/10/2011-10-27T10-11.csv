3162464,comment,3162289,3162355,7,0,masklinn,,,"> Does this accomplish anything above and beyond what XPath is capable of?<p>Nope. In terms of pure capabilities CSS selectors are still (mostly) a subset of XPath selectors (even XPath 1.0 I'd say)<p>> I've always wondered why W3C has been pushing more than one standard for selecting elements in SGML and XML documents.<p>I don't have an answer, but I see 4 reasons:<p>* NIH, the W3C is not really a big coherent group, and technically CSS selectors predate XPath (CSS level 1 became a CR in December 1996, XPath 1.0 did not reach this status before November 1999)<p>* CSS selectors are purpose-built for HTML and have efficient (and simple) shortcuts for a bunch of tasks: selecting on ids or classes has a 1-character overhead in CSS versus XPath having 5 for ids and classes... well you're looking at a good 50 characters in XPath 1 (w/o exslt) I'd say, there just isn't a convenient way to say ""an element with this value in an attribute which is a space-separated list of names"". Another one is XPath being built for parent/child relationships where CSS selectors default to ancestor/descendant relations, and makes it easier and shorter to broadly apply rules. The last one would be pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, to handle these in XPath you'd have to add a bunch of functions to the core set (see point 4 for what I think of XPath functions)<p>* For rendering-speed reasons, CSS are processed back-to-front, I'm not sure how good/easy it would be to process XPath that way (not too hard I'd guess, but it definitely wasn't standardized based on this thinking)<p>* XPath is actually pretty complex, much more so than CSS selectors (even CSS3 or CSS4 selectors), I know I always a hard time with getting those fucking funcalls right, the syntax is fiddly and different XPath libraries tend to behave very differently on namespacing & al of funcalls. Also, the data-typing is complete shit.<p>I like XPath 1.0 (though I think XPath 2.0 went full retard in backporting XQuery stuff and integrating a bunch of garbage relevant only to XSLT 2.0), but while I regularly pine for some specific XPath features in CSS selectors (usually more flexible axis modifiers) I really wouldn't enjoy having to use XPath instead of CSS in my style sheets.",1319713152

After seeing the WP7, even knowing it was coming, I know that their lovely design work was cheapened by that release. It's still good design, but it lost something tangible and wonderful, that sense of being something different and better.

This industry opposes Thorium tech since the government decided to abandon it's research in the 1960s.  Why? Thorium fussion is safe and turns itself off in the case of a power shutdown or emergency. That's what makes it better. However, during the 1960s arms race, the other dangerous high-pressure reactors using Uranium+Plutonium were adopted because they have dangerous byproducts - use in - you guessed it, nuclear bombs!<p>Hence Thorium, which is as abundant in the Earth as lead and actually creates all the heat inside our earth (read: magma) was abandoned. It was a true mistake because thorium is so abundant and so safe, it actually has more than 1 million times more energy efficiency when compared to fossil fules. It truely might be the solution to global warming.<p>Why? The Chinese are planning to completely control LFTR Thorium technology within 10-15 years, and they will also use energy and heat from this tech to power all their recent plans for global domination of de-salinization technology (hence, control fresh water sources as well).  We're really stupid to not pick up where we left off in the 1960s and finish this tech. Don't direct your anger at Thorium like it's somehow connected to the Nuclear Power industry - it's not. The current industry opposes this tech because it has no profit in terms of selling an otherwise abundant fuel (Thorium) when currently they make 99% of their profits selling dangerous Uranium+Plutonium-based fuel to current nuclear power plants.<p>IF YOU SUPPORT THIS REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY, PLEASE SIGN TH WHITEHOUSE PETITION TO GET THE BALL ROLLING IN WASHINGTON!<p><a href=""https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/%21/petition/provide-funding-liquid-fluoride-thorium-reactor-lftr-research-and-development-energy-independence/JkwTRBlv"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/%21/petition/provide-f...</a>",1319711209

A standard workweek of 40 hours is different to a maximum workweek of 35 hours.  Put yourself in the position of a startup founder.  You've got $x million of runway in your account.  Now the government says your employees have to work less and you have to pay them more.  Where is the value created?  It's not.<p>As I said - what are you going to do, lock them up if they work 40 hours?<p>How about we just leave things alone with regard to minimum wages and let people work as much as they want?<p>Yes, there are already minimum wages, and we know that this already causes unemployment.

Now you've just made everything more expensive, and you've increased unemployment.<p>Yes, it's probably a strong reaction, but I just hate the thought of any of this type of 'solution' ever getting traction.

But would we be better off? No.  It doesn't work at any level.  Sure, you can borrow a billion dollars and employ people to dig holes in the ground and fill them back in again, but then you've just made society a billion dollars poorer, and all that potential labor to do something with has been wasted.<p>Bottom line : people should stop trying to impose price controls on things, including labor.

Placing form fields on a single page means that the user doesn't have to hand over information at the risk of not receiving something in return.<p>Requesting an email address or password multiple times is frustrating too.

However, I&#x27;m in Chrome at the moment, and in a recent version of Chrome they decided to drop NPAPI support, so plugins (including Flash) no longer function. Technically, they replaced the NPAPI Flash with Pepper Flash (Pepper being a new plugin API, I think); when I upgraded to the version of Chrome that did all this, it was still masked in Gentoo, so it wouldn&#x27;t install without me specifically unmasking it… which I didn&#x27;t. This could just be my distro, of course, though Gentoo is quite wonderful for other reasons. It does appear they&#x27;ve unmasked it, so whenever I next upgrade, I can get it.<p>Even on non-Gentoo, I still feel like there are some hoops to jump through to get it. Distros typically can&#x27;t offer it in their package repos, due to the license, right? (It&#x27;s the same with proprietary music/video codecs last I checked.)<p>Point being, it requires work just to make it work. HTML doesn&#x27;t require that.

This is why things like rape crisis centers exist, precisely because the police were <i>not</i> helping.

8201326,comment,8201119,8201119,8,0,idlewords,,,"The question of how to get paid for writing has always struck me as a real &quot;insiders&#x27;&quot; debate, that ignores the truly revolutionary effect of the Internet.  There is a group of people who self-identify as writers who claim to speak for a much broader population of people doing most of the writing.<p>It&#x27;s useful to separate three constituencies: readers, writers, and publishers.<p>Readers have never had it better. Not only is it easier to find good new writing online, as well as vast archives of stuff, but the Internet has made it possible for millions of people who never would have made it through the traditional publication system to write to their hearts&#x27; content. Most of it is terrible and a small fraction is amazing. But when you multiply the small fraction by the huge numbers of people who would not otherwise have published anything, it&#x27;s pure gain.<p>Similarly, writers have never had it better! It&#x27;s always been hard to get paid for your writing, and that hasn&#x27;t changed. But you no longer have to fight to get published. You can write on your own, or in collaboration with others, and put what you&#x27;ve written in a place the whole world can see. We&#x27;ve grown used to this revolutionary fact, so we don&#x27;t appreciate what an advance it is over what came before.  Check out an old writer&#x27;s guide from the 1990&#x27;s and you&#x27;ll discover a world of stamp-licking, envelope-stuffing, and waiting weeks to get a rejection letter from yet another obscure literary journal or in-flight magazine.<p>Over the last twelve years, I&#x27;ve written about four hundred thousand words that I never would have bothered with if there hadn&#x27;t been a potential audience. At the same time, I enjoyed the writing of hundreds of people who wrote for the same reason. Some of them wrote as a hobby, some of them wrote as a study aid (researching a technical article is a terrific way to really learn something), and some were domain experts who had a knack for explaining their work to laypeople, and got a kick out of doing it after hours.  Some of these people got &#x27;real&#x27; book deals, but the books were inevitably watered down versions of the kind of stuff I could find for free online.<p>That leaves the publishers, the people who are really getting squeezed. In some cases, they are big companies that are easy to hate, analogous to the record companies. In other cases, they are earnest magazines run by wonderful people on a shoestring budget.  My problem is that they present the debate as being between giant corporations and the heroic small publishers, fighting for the rights of the journeyman writer.  This ignores the vast mass of writers outside the system, and the many new forms of writing that the Internet has created for us to enjoy.  Writing is in much better shape than pieces like this suggest.  But it is just not a viable way to earn your living, unless you are in a tiny group of truly extraordinary people. And that&#x27;s perfectly fine.",1408517022

It&#x27;s not a particularly good point. I would like to know more about the fundamental problem with existing specs. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with attributes that couldn&#x27;t be fixed in browser implementation rather than specification, certainly not a &quot;problem&quot; that could only be solved with React or jQuery as suggested in comments. I thought that specs nowadays are modeled after &quot;what works in todays browsers&quot; rather than &quot;what would be better&quot;, much like HTML5 is modeled after what works in IE6 (talking about &quot;brave enough&quot;). I also thought that this proposed simplification is already part of DOM4, or did I make that up? Should namespaced attributes simply become unsupported on an API level? That&#x27;s a cost to pay, much like querySelector comes with the cost of 1) only being able to query the document structure downwards, not upwards, and 2) only being able to query the default namespace. The API may be less awkward, but it introduces problems that are <i>actually</i> problematic, so more arguments would come in handy for me to understand the point.",1408516967

Unfortunately, many unit tests are written with a lot of assumptions, basically testing that you have kept the existing implementation. Especially unit tests that are written in a naive way is like this. In such a case you basically have to rewrite both the implementation _and_ all the unit tests. In that case the unit tests is in fact making change harder.<p>Unfortunately, much of current software development literature more or less encourage writing this kind of unit testing, in that they emphasize the importance of tests (&quot;the definition of legacy code = no unit tests&quot;, &quot;code without 100% test coverage is by definition low quality), while at the same time don&#x27;t tell what a good unit test look like. This leads to brittle unit test suites using a lot of mocking etc, that is nearly impossible to not break if changing code at all.<p>Of cause good unit tests are not like this, but it means that both you and the GP can be right at times.",1408516382

Moreover, political power has historically been more concentrated than now.  Think about how many times, in history, massive changes could not have existed without turnover of the establishment.  I think progress demands turnover, because those in power tend both to stay in power and to think like they did before.<p>So I think innovation and progress requires turnover, fair enough.  I also don&#x27;t believe that &quot;current human society&quot; is necessarily any better at decision making than &quot;Middle Ages  society&quot;, so I wouldn&#x27;t think that humankind is now equipped to deal with immortality.<p>So yeah, I guess I&#x27;m saying that old men should die.  I wish it weren&#x27;t awful as it so often is, and I wish that maybe it were a bit longer, but there it is.<p>* also fair to question the assumption of historical &quot;progress&quot;; I&#x27;m not sure but humans weren&#x27;t better off as hunter-gatherers than what I fear our future could become.",1408515519

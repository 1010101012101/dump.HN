6060181,comment,6059508,6059508,28,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I can say from experience that as you get older and develop a broader understanding of the world, two things conspire against your focus; old ideas presented as new ideas, and scars of things not done.<p>In the first case you will find you are presented with some &quot;new idea&quot; which is so revolutionary it has its own set of buzzwords, its own methodology, and its own unique values. Except that it isn&#x27;t new, its like those folks who drag up popular HN posts from 2 or 3 or 4 years ago and re-post them for the quick karma hit. There is are people who re-wrap old ideas and pass them off like holiday presents at a white elephant gift exchange. The trick there is to spend enough focus points to validate that the idea isn&#x27;t really all that new, identify where (and if) it varies from what you&#x27;ve already seen/heard/done and then either discard or integrate it into the same slot.<p>The second is tougher. There was a really funny skit on Saturday Night Live where two psychics meet for their first date. As psychics they foresee all of the events from first date to heady romance to angry bittering to rejection and separation. They decide not to go out. As an experienced entrepreneur it can be really disheartening to be asked to walk down a road you&#x27;ve been down one or more times before where you know there is a pit of pain at the end of it. And then not proceed knowing the probable outcome without risking the possible better outcome. For example, try to find anyone, who did any startup in the 90&#x27;s. to do a startup where you are selling pet food over the Internet.<p>Because of these effects I think experience can really have a damaging effect on focus if you don&#x27;t actively work to avoid it.",1374094792

6060133,comment,6059844,6059844,8,0,Kapura,,,"This seems as good a place as any to dump thoughts about &quot;app-albums&quot; in general. One thing that I always try to remember is that we&#x27;re living in the future, and it&#x27;s foolish to assume that things from the past will work the same way in the future.<p>Hence, app albums. Album apps. Whatever. Point is, people have smartphones now. The music experience is changing because of that. I&#x27;m down with it. In fact, $13 for an album with all the extra app functionality seems pretty good, seeing as the standard iTunes album price is $10.<p>But the problem with creating this sort of future-music experience is that it leaves some people behind. It used to be simply an iPhone app, but now there&#x27;s an android port. Guess what: my phone still can&#x27;t get it, because my phone&#x27;s version of android isn&#x27;t supported by the app. I couldn&#x27;t get the Magna Carta Holy Grail app either. Apps aren&#x27;t a universal format like a record or a cd or an MP3. They therefore necessarily leave some people behind.<p>You could argue that every media shift does that. But when the album becomes a sort of multi-media experience, it&#x27;s tragic that somebody would need a different device that in almost every other respect is functionally identical to their current device to experience it.<p>Which is what makes a service like apportable important: it&#x27;s expanding the audience of this numedia album experience. I doubt there are many people who want to limit who has access to what art or information, but the problem with being so future is that you&#x27;re imposing those limits in the pursuit of making something unique.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m overthinking it.

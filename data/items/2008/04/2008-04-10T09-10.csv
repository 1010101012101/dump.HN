Do you consider it important to document your decisions somehow to understand them later? Do you communicate decisions transparently towards co-workers or employees?

It might be time for a reality check though.<p>Step back and take a look at your idea. Does it have legs. Is it something that people want. Can you monetize it. Don't take your own opinion seriously, ask people if they would use it and see ads or pay for it. If you can't find anyone who would, come up with another idea.<p>Figure out what it would take to get to the next step. If the answer is a boatload of money or a team of people then it may be time to come up with another idea that has a lower  bar to clear. If the answer is a couple of months of working nights for the founders go for it.<p>One more thing. I've been lurking here for awhile and I see the passion and desire to make things happen here all the time. It motivates me to work harder and make it happen for my project. I think this small community is a great virtual community. We can all use it to push each other to succeed. I know I am. I wonder how many YC rejects will succeed? I'm guessing a lot more than normal.<p>I couldn't apply with my reality. I'm too old. I need too much money. I can't move. etc...<p>But it does not matter. I will finish my project and I will release it and see if it has legs.<p>I can't wait to see more new products announced here by the YC rejects. I'll keep lurking...",1207819276

159759,comment,159535,159535,0,0,mattjung,,,"I wonder if it would be possible to get some basic quantitative feedback from YC to get a clearer idea about the strong and the weak points of an application, e.g. a rating from 1 to 5 for criteria like quality and potential of idea, fittingness of the founders, progress of the project, potential and risk of business model, etc. you name it.
Risk for YC would be that people try to optimize their application against the criteria and distort somehow the competition.",1207818843

Also, since FJS is fake, I don't quite see how I can pull an ad hominem on him. It's not like I could attack his personal opinion.<p>Anyway, yes, I admit it, I really don't like his style. He is a good writer, so why does he have to hide behind the FJS personae (since he revealed his identitiy anyway)? Ad hominen or not, I don't want to take any advice from a dishonest person. Give me xkcd over this any day (why does FJS make it on hacker news???).",1207818183

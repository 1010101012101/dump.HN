At first its such a huge thing that it blots out the sun.  It always stays that huge, but as we move away from it in time, eventually we get to where we can see the sun peeping out around the edges.<p>When I grew up and got married, my first husband was kidnapped and we found his murdered remains four months later.  It is an unsolved mystery that is 23 years old.  I cried and cried and cried and cried and cried.  I stood out in my garden, dug my feet into the mud, and I cried.  I cried for three weeks straight.  No anti-depressants - just process.  Grief is a process.<p>My advice is:  1)  Your mind can take you to weird places around murder.  Don't get too out there.  People die and we miss them.  Its that simple.  2)  Don't talk about it all the time to everyone you know.  Its pretty easy to say, ""Hi, nice to meet you, my dad died,"" because its like a huge sunburn all over your body.  But talking about it constantly keeps it at the surface of your conscious mind.  It is better to wait and speak about your feelings with a trusted loved one or friend or in therapy.  3)  Get a therapist - a cognitive therapist - and shop around for someone who is logical, intuitive and genuine.<p>I'm really sorry to hear you have lost your father.  My father was the best father a person could ever have.  He was brilliant, a scientist at NASA, a protege to Werner Von Braun, had an IQ higher than Albert Einstein's and was warm, loving - he was just the best.  Its hard for other people to understand when you lose someone that is wonderful, because there are lots of people who lose a regular Joe, but how many of us have the experience of losing someone awesome?  By this I mean that lots of people have dads that left them, didn't pay child support, or were abusive - its a different experience when you have a wonderful dad.  I keep a photo of my father above my kitchen sink.  Even though I lost him when I was so young, I'm grateful I had that man for a father and the love I received from him.<p>You get up in the morning, brush your teeth, floss, get a shower, eat your breakfast, and go about your day.

Diplomacy is incredibly complex and delicate.  In particular when communicating with dissidents of foreign countries, it's often necessary to have complex and multi-faceted positions in private communications, some of which may be conflicting and offensive to one side or the other.<p>Take communications with North Korean or other dissidents as an example.  On the surface, Kim Jong needs to think we are negotiating with him without trying to support opposition and bring down his government - otherwise he may become unstable and violent.  We also however need to provide moral and material support to dissidents.<p>Shall we just be the fools and pretend that diplomacy is not a complex game?  In a perfect world, maybe there would be no need for secrecy, but to think that diplomacy does not need some level of underhandedness, deception, head-fakes, and other manipulation is terribly naive.<p>We don't yet know what is going to be released, and perhaps some of it very well should be public, however if any of it damages our efforts to work with dissidents in oppressed countries, or has other destructive effects on the work of the State Department, there will be serious questions about whether real-time transparency is really what we want when it comes to diplomacy.",1290716750

1940920,comment,1940630,1940630,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"The approach of OneSocialWeb seems to be to define and extend existing standard protocols. This general direction seems appealing to me but in anycase, it's one extreme of possible approaches.<p>With Elgg or Insoshi, a ""social networking engine"" isn't particularly different from a generic CMS. In this sense, Drupal might be the leading alternative to Facebook, since it's dominant in its field (you could argue for wordpress too). And maybe that's an idea. An alternative to Facebook is to add a protocol to several common CMSes that would let you aggregate you friend's posts - Tie-together all the world's BBSes into a bullwork against Facebook. Anyway, a pure CMS where you sort the protocol later is the other extreme of approaches.<p>Appleseed and Diaspora seem somewhat in the middle of these approaches. They sort-of have protocols but don't seem to be protocol driven.",1290715944

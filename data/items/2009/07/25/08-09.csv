723111,comment,722962,722963,0,0,jacquesm,,,"It's hard to get people to be active, and 'contributing' by talking instead of by coding is very tempting.<p>Wikipedia is also suffering of this to some extent, there are plenty of pages where the 'talk' section is several times the size of the article, with the endless splitting of hairs about minor syntactical or semantical details.<p>Still, there are community projects where IRC has been a very successful community tool, some of them wouldn't ever have gotten off the ground without it.<p>Overall I think the benefits outweigh the downsides, but having a good set of moderators in a channel I think is the key difference to where it worked and where it became a distraction.",1248510992
723110,comment,722266,722401,0,0,salvadors,,,"Couchsurfing has a convention that if you're going to surf you should really host as well, unless there's a good reason why not. It's not enforced in any way, but there's definitely an expectation from many hosts that you will at least fill out a half-decent profile and try to build up some decent recommendations from people in your home town by attending a few social events or whatever. In other words, if you haven't hosted a few people, or otherwise gotten at least a couple of recommendation (and taken some time to flesh out your profile to make yourself seem at least a little interesting), a lot of hosts won't take you.<p>CS is fantastic, but it's not simply about free accommodation: to get the most out of it you need to put in quite a bit of effort too (which is as it should be).<p>Airbnb seems to be for people who don't really want to go that route.",1248510927
723109,comment,722517,723042,0,0,trominos,,,"God, you're right.<p>I went into writing that post fully intending to make the point that ""producing work"" for e.g. the glazier is only useful AT ALL if the glazier isn't already working as much as he wants; moreover, <i>even in such a special circumstance</i>, obviously no additional wealth is created by the window breaking and the glazier getting paid to fix it. <i>But in the special circumstance of the glazier working less than he wants before he gets the job and then getting paid to do the job by a rich guy, something good still happens</i> -- wealth is distributed to the glazier via a mechanism that is voluntary for all parties involved. This is vital. <i>Even in the best of cases</i>, ""creating work"" through the destruction and replacement of wealth amounts to charity and nothing more. But ""forced charity"" of this sort can be very good for an economy on the whole in certain circumstances. Like in a depression.<p>Anyway, I must've been really out of it; I usually don't get wrapped up in the details of making a point to such an extent that I forget the point that I'm trying to make. My entire post was pretty stupid, except for the part where I said that this book is blinded by its own biases (which I stand by). Sorry about that.<p>PS: I'm still not in a great state of mind (I'm exhausted but experiencing mild insomnia), so I make no guarantees about the quality of the post, either.",1248510871

723106,comment,722115,723071,0,0,zby,,,"Why is it so inaccurate?  ""Coltan is a metal that conducts heat unusually brilliantly."" compare to wikipedia: ""Coltan is the colloquial African name for columbite - tantalite, a metallic ore from which the elements niobium and tantalum are extracted."" Also in wikipedia: ""The United States Geological Survey reports in its 2006 yearbook that the Democratic Republic of the Congo produces a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum."" - so this implying of guilt for everyone buying electronics is rather silly.<p>He trades truth for rhetorics undermining all the sympathy I might have.",1248510414

But besides his own conjecture, without which there wouldn't be much left of an article, did he say anything that's not true?<p>What were the earlier straws, by the way? If you just dig around a bit, I'm sure you'll find quite a few really enjoyable and insightful articles on the site.<p><i>To twist that into ""look how bad windows 7 is gonna be lol"" is obnoxious and disingenuous.</i><p>I thought he was just pointing out how MS is worried, and wants to increase W7's adoption by giving the RC away. There's also been some speculation about whether it's actually the finished W7 just dubbed an RC because giving away the finished product would look far too desperate.<p>Unfortunately, I've seen a lot of excitement over W7, so it looks like MS will have a successful Windows on their hands again.",1248510355

For each crate, the announcer starts with a high price (say 100) and counts rapidly down (""99, 98, 97 ..."") until one of the buyers shouts out ""Soo"" to buy the crate at that price.<p>Not as amusing as bidding up an auction, but this seems a time-efficient method for finding the buyer's price limit - after all, the fish is not getting any fresher sitting there ...",1248510103

Some script messes with the Object constructor? only affects its own execution context.<p>Saying a blanket ""js must die"" isn't really understanding the issues, as they are actually in browsers, not js.<p>It's like saying python/perl/etc is an insecure language and must die, because it usually shares the same filesystem between processes.",1253879290

843276,comment,842462,843060,0,0,MikeW,,,"I'll take a stab at it as I've used both. Or rather I've used both for actual work.<p>DropBox wins for me because it can access their servers through our firewall (which only allows HTTP/S access to less than 5 ports). Live Mesh could not do this.<p>I found dropbox a tiny barrier to entry. It was so unobtrusive. Live Mesh pops up stuff on startup, complains that it can't access the internet. Etc. Dropbox just stays silent and waits file locks are released and internet connectivity returns.<p>Getting at my files online is SO much easier with DropBox, ESPECIALLY now since they have the new UI. It's fast, Mesh isn't.<p>I've never used the remote desktop feature so I can't comment.<p>Oh and the feature I use nearly daily is the Public folder where I just save a file in there, right click in Explorer, copy the public URL and give them the URL rather than worry if the email client can support a 10MB file. Brilliant, much faster than slow Messenger file transfers! I don't believe Mesh has this ability.<p>Anyway, DropBox is a simple enough concept and I feel they refined it so well that anyone can use it. Mesh is just complex and has way too much UI stuff going on.<p>I'm still well under the 2GB limit but have a 50GB Pro account (for now anyway) - just waiting for the selective sync feature now",1253879131

Changing this would require changing the semantics of the language (i.e. you would break most Javascript code in existence), at which point it essentially ceases to be Javascript (unless you want to start to argue about replacing axe handles and such, but the original point stands - you could take a new language which fixes the execution model and call it ""Javascript"", but it would still not be the Javascript we use right now).",1253878621

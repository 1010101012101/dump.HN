IRC has been around for decades, bots that could post any kinds of info to a channel as well and for a user IRC is not that much harder to use than slack, but it&#x27;s definitely more nerdy.\nSo i kind of feel sad that open stuff like IRC didn&#x27;t really ever become mainstream and now we have a closed platform that at some point will belong to one of the big tech corps and people will start to move off of it again.",1453885110

10979005,comment,10973889,10975460,0,0,jonsneyers,,,"Thanks for the compliment about FLIF&#x27;s progressive decoding! (FLIF author speaking here)<p>However, truncated FLIF files will (probably) never achieve the same quality/size ratio as dedicated lossy methods that can produce a completely different file for each quality setting.<p>So at the moment I still see an important use case for lossy methods. However, in the future, I can imagine that people will start to demand/expect lossless encoding, to avoid generation loss and to get the most out of their display hardware.\nE.g. higher bit depths are becoming a thing, while the JPEG/WebP color space (YCbCr) is effectively less than 22 bits per pixel (roughly speaking, red and blue are only 7-bit), and chroma subsampling makes this even worse. Also what&#x27;s the use of ever higher display resolutions if most of those pixels are only displaying compression artifacts or blur?\nLossy formats like JPEG/WebP/BPG/JP2/JXR are good at medium-quality, but if you use them at a near-lossless quality setting (e.g. 99 or 100 for JPEG), they often produce bigger files than lossless formats.<p>Meanwhile, the range of display sizes is getting larger: while in the past, we had a range from say 13&quot; monitors to 21&quot; monitors, now we have a range from 1.5&quot; smart watches to huge 100&quot; smart TVs. I do think that in order to avoid huge amounts of rescaling/transcoding, we need image/video formats that are &quot;responsive by design&quot;, like JPEG2000 and FLIF (and progressive JPEG to some extent).",1453884904

10978994,comment,10978838,10978838,0,0,jasim,,,"React is just a library. It is the ideas behind it that are important:<p>a) building web front-ends by dividing them into components which are first-class citizens of the codebase, and can be composed, parameterized and reused, just like pure functions. [1]<p>b) expressing the view as a pure function of state has replaced any need to mutate the DOM manually and think about transitions ($.remove(), $.append() etc.). We need virtual-dom and diffing to be able to pull this off successfully, which makes this abstraction irreducible.<p>c) interspersing content-inside-code (JSX) is better than code-inside-content (template languages like Angular). [2]<p>The recent &#x27;React fatigue&#x27; is due to people trying to figure out how to best manage state within this framework and causing a lot of noise in the process. And that is perfectly fine, but if you are confused by it, just use vanilla React and React&#x27;s immutability helpers, keep all the state in the root node and pass everything down as props {...this.props}, and then when you get a hang of it, hop on to Redux.

10978990,comment,10974948,10978320,0,0,monkey,,,"Hehe.  This is probably why the author of the document summarized the discussion of the Hz to say:<p>&#x27;Use of &quot;Hz&quot; will cause communication problems, errors, and make one party or another look insane in the eyes of the other.&#x27;  LOL.<p>* Every physicist or electrical engineer or high school physics student has &quot;known&quot; for the past 100 years that a Hz is 2 pi radians/s.  And it was defined that way for a long time, as the document referenced shows, and almost <i>everyone</i> follows this convention.<p>* Everyone who follows the current rules of the SI exactly (as per JadeNB&#x27;s analysis above) &quot;knows&quot; that a Hz is 1 radian/s.  His analysis is not hard to follow.  It&#x27;s utterly unambiguous and machine-parseable.  There is no possible other answer.<p>So, you can see there&#x27;s a problem there.  The document correctly traces the changes in the definition of the Hz and radian at different times that led to this situation.  (e.g. the Hz used to be defined as &quot;cycles/s&quot;)<p>The funny part is seeing what different units-aware software packages do to try and make themselves seem reasonable.  :)<p>* Frink (the package from which this data file emanates.):  Follow the currently-written rules of the SI (that is, 1 Hz = 1 radian/s) but rant about it in the data file.  Also, if you read the data file closely, it allows you to switch between radians having their own dimensions or being dimensionless (but warns against the former.)<p>* GNU Units:  Follow the currently-written rules of the SI (that is, 1 Hz = 1 radian/s)  Not sure if there&#x27;s a rant.<p>* Wolfram Alpha:  This was an interesting one.  At launch, they followed the currently-written rules of the SI but this evidently led to lots of bug reports and a current inconsistent state.  They used to report that &quot;1 Hz = 1 radian/s&quot; but soon they hacked and patched around these in some inconsistent ways.  For example, it would work differently if you put in &quot;1 Hz in radians/s&quot; and &quot;1.0 Hz in radians/s&quot;.<p>Nowadays, if you do &quot;1 Hz in radians/s&quot; in Wolfram Alpha, it gives you the answer &quot;6.283 rad/s&quot; which is more acceptable (but wrong according to strict interpretation of the SI) but has a little disclaimer where it says below (in gray)\n    &quot;(using 1 Hz = 1 rps (revolution per second))&quot;<p>A revolution meaning a rotation of 2 pi radians, I hope.<p>But it&#x27;s a single-case kludgey workaround.  You can see\nthat their system is hacked and self-inconsistent, because if you divide both sides of that calculation by something else, say, seconds:<p><pre><code>    &quot;1 Hz/s in radians/s/s&quot;\n</code></pre>\nwhich of course should give the exact same numerical value as above, 6.283, but this time it gives 1!<p>* Wolfram Language / Mathematica:  Follow the currently-written rules of the SI (that is, &quot;Convert[Hertz, Radian/Second]&quot; gives &quot;Radian/Second&quot;)  Note that seems to be a different result than Wolfram|Alpha.<p>* Google calculator:  At the start, Google Calculator would follow the currently-written rules of the SI (that is, &quot;1 Hz in radians/s&quot;) would return 1.  But this caused lots of consternation and bug reports:  <a href=""http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/kuddXzzPpo4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/kudd...</a><p>The funniest part about that nowadays is that Google Calculator utterly refuses to do anything with the Hz, even if you force it with a preceding equals sign.  The interactive interface only lets you turn Hz into kHz, MHz, etc, and other multiples.  LOL.  I&#x27;m sure that other self-consistent environments wish they had this latitude.  Like a politician, any question they don&#x27;t like, they just pretend not to hear, and give you somebody else&#x27;s search results instead.  :)<p>This problem with the definition of the Hz is nothing new, and is well known in the literature.  For example, see:\nM.P. Foster, Quantities, units and computing, Computer Standards & Interfaces (2013), <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2013.02.001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2013.02.001</a><p>In short, the author of the rant might be messed up in the head from having to 1.) deal with these inconsistencies and 2.) try to look non-insane to two groups of people who are simultaneously both right and both wrong.",1453884493

10978987,comment,10978565,10978753,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Our economic systems in the West may be far from ideal, and certainly create huge imbalances between the richest and the poorest that we would do well to address for many reasons. A significant part of that imbalance comes from our company structures, where the workers creating the value often receive relatively little compensation, while founders, investors and the most senior staff receive most of the benefit.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think your argument that no-one is worth a huge amount of money is inherently a strong one. My favourite example of this is JK Rowling, who is arguably the most successful author in history and reportedly worth around a billion dollars today. That money was earned primarily from the success of the Harry Potter books she wrote, which have sold almost half a billion copies worldwide. That&#x27;s a lot of happiness she&#x27;s created for a lot of people, and personally I don&#x27;t begrudge her being heavily rewarded for doing more good than most of us ever will in our lifetimes.<p>The position is not as clear cut in the case of Paul Allen, since he didn&#x27;t almost single-handedly write the software that generated the vast amount of value Microsoft has produced in the world over the years, and there is a much stronger element of the founder/investor/senior vs. employee argument I mentioned before in his case. But given how much value Microsoft has generated over the years, if you&#x27;re going to criticise Allen&#x27;s wealth I think you need more than just a blunt &quot;no-one deserves to be that rich&quot; argument to be convincing.",1453884452

The market will level off because fewer new projects and companies are reaching for virt as evidenced by, yes, Google, and half the other household names in the valley.<p>Thought exercise: Google published Dataflow out of their work on streaming architecture and said they are moving on from MapReduce (for the most part).

That work was continued by a teammate for several years.<p>I spent 3 years rewriting most of the foundation, UI, and server infrastructure for Workstation 8, bringing the ability to connect to remote VMware ESXi/vSphere servers, along with the server component of Workstation 8. This work allowed VMs to be hosted on any server and accessed from any other server, and allowed VMs to be pushed between servers. 3 solid years on this feature alone, given just how much was needed to make that happen.<p>In the same release, we replaced the old Teams feature (a single feature that provided a multi-VM UI along with software-defined networking segments) with a series of more independent, more useful features. These were just a couple of the major features released in Workstation 8, and with all this came cleanup in the UI to keep the experience sane, not bloated.<p>That came out in 2011.<p>Workstation 9, released in 2012, came with a web-based UI for interacting with VMs called WSX (a feature I dedicated a bit over a year to). It also added UI refinement for the features that come out in Workstation 8, more remote VM support, hardware improvements (USB 3, Hyper-V, OpenGL for Linux VMs, nested/Inception-like VMs), locked down virtual machines for IT, and probably more that I can&#x27;t remember.<p>Workstation 10 followed that a year later, and brought guest hardware support for tablets, enhancements for Windows 8 hosts, more remote VM improvements, better command line automation for remote-controlling/creating VMs, and a bunch of other things. UI-wise, it was a smaller release, but it did a lot for the hardware support.<p>I left around this time to focus on Review Board (<a href=""https://www.reviewboard.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reviewboard.org/</a>) full-time.<p>Since then, they released 2 major versions: Workstation 11 and 12. From what I can tell, these were largely about hardware improvements and performance improvements, less about major UI changes, but there&#x27;s a lot that has to happen for these improvements. Hardware improvements are crucial to keeping the VMs useful in many situations. Performance was also a focus. While building these releases, the team was also busy helping out the View team by helping them consume bits of the Workstation/Fusion codebase. They also begun development of AppCatalyst and Flex.<p>There&#x27;s also work that happened on Player, Ace, and other things, all throughout.<p>So that&#x27;s a lot of killer features in my opinion :) I barely scratched the surface of 8, and didn&#x27;t go into all the stuff we did in 6 and 7.<p>We were all very proud of the product, and often spent our free time working on it. I should point out, this was <i>not</i> a large team by any means. It was an amazing team, though. A family. One that will survive these layoffs, one way or another.",1453882959

Her income is definitely lower for a similar position, but I&#x27;d say the quality of life is pretty good when she can hop a free bus and be skiing in 10 minutes.<p>She&#x27;s definitely fortunate to be in the &#x27;professional&#x27; class though. Most of the seasonal workers (largely South Americans and college-aged US students), the restaurant / cleaning staff (largely hispanic families), and the otherwise low-income live 20-30 miles away in trailer parks set up by Vail Resorts.  They used to live on the other side of the highway, but that land was too valuable so they tore down the worker housing and are constructing luxury condos instead.<p>It all sounds very familiar.",1453882851

The person you are replying to is dead on and I suspect you are conflating &quot;I support a lot of virt environments in my profession&quot; with the state of the industry.<p>At scale, in prod, virt is legacy. Aside from Linode where I obviously ran virt, the only virt I&#x27;ve ever touched in private datacenters is relegated to labs or testing farms. We have a lot of tech, both from supercomputing and the new valley stuff which is inexplicably rewriting all of that, that makes virtualization completely unnecessary outside of a multitenant situation with separate paying customers and security domains. Even there multiple vendors are working on it, notably Intel, who is pushing VT-x into containers with multiple efforts.<p>Don&#x27;t be so confident to talk about reality, because yours is very different from mine. The original poster was unguarded with their claim but in terms of winds of the industry, they couldn&#x27;t be more correct, and if you think I&#x27;m wrong you&#x27;re on the wrong side of the shift that is coming, nigh already here.<p>Example: We bought space in Virginia for Foursquare and didn&#x27;t deploy a single byte of virt. My current employer has dozens of facilities and virt is a lab thing. No prod, anywhere, across dozens of products and lines and organizations, uses virt. Google doesn&#x27;t, right you are. Nor does Twitter, who is deep into Mesos (same for everyone who is also deep into Mesos or its many friends).<p>You might scoff and say well, my CIO says, and you&#x27;d be correct today, but the state of the art for resource utilization at scale moved away from virt because we figured out that running full operating systems next to each other as a bandaid for bad CD and provisioning and resource allocation stories is a shitload of overhead for zero gain. There is absolutely nothing that virt gives you, aside from a perf hit and unpredictable low-level behavior (some of us care about cache lines and context switches), which cannot be implemented with tooling atop bare metal platforms. Virt makes your hot aisle hotter so you don&#x27;t have to figure out bare metal provisioning. You should care about that, then figure it out. It&#x27;s not hard.<p>If you are strongly convinced that I&#x27;m wrong, much like your neighbor posters, the state of the art simply hasn&#x27;t made it to you yet. Sorry. You should be willing to consider, however, instead of sniping at change like your tone will keep it at bay.

10978876,comment,10975317,10976576,0,0,toast0,,,"> How is it easier to debug a message-passing architecture than a monolith?<p>You can observe the messages as they&#x27;re passed, which is usually enough. In my experience in Erlang, a lot of messages include a pid to reply to, so if you get an unexpected message, you can often see where it came from, and then look at the messages that came into that process, etc (or grep the code on likely identifiers). Erlang makes this pretty easy, you can also peek at the mailbox for a process to see what other messages it hasn&#x27;t read yet, etc.  This model works really well for me, because I&#x27;ve been using it for years to debug networking applications with tcpdump and friends: figure out what&#x27;s gone wrong over the wire, then you can figure out where it&#x27;s gone wrong in the code.<p>Added: I guess that doesn&#x27;t really address emergent behavior.  Most of the emergent behavior I&#x27;ve seen is really around overload conditions, most of the debugging around that is focused around finding the bottleneck(s) (which is usually a problem in a simple process -- you can tell which ones because they have a huge mailbox), why there isn&#x27;t enough back pressure (it&#x27;s usually because the senders aren&#x27;t waiting for confirmation, or aren&#x27;t waiting long enough, especially in combination with retries), and how to shed load instead of falling over (which is tricky)",1453882313

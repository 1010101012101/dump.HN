56278,story,,,3,3,staunch,"Ask News.YC: Advertising with Revenue Sharing or Free?",,"My product is a service for other sites to re-use. I'm trying to decide whether I should make it advertising supported with revenue sharing (50/50 split with the webmaster) or make it totally free with no advertising. I can afford to offer it free. My primary goal right now is just to drive adoption. It seems intuitive (to me) that free would further that goal more than including advertising, but I've also realized that offering a new revenue stream for webmasters might be just as (or more) effective.<p>I'm afraid that letting individual webmasters choose would result in a muddled ""brand image"", with the people who want a new revenue stream (falsely) believing it's not good for that and the people who want it free believing (falsely) it's not available advertising-free.<p>I find myself flip-flopping trying to decide which direction to go. Any thoughts or advice?",1190123906

56273,comment,55981,55981,0,0,aston,,,"This is incredible news. Facebook is paying people to be a part of their platform. I thought it was supposed to work the other way around?<p>edit: At the moment, Facebook seems to be valuable in the same way that Tommy Lee is a celebrity. It's not clear to me how Tommy Lee gained his popularity, and he's not really that interesting in the first place, but he remains popular by continuing to be Tommy Lee. Facebook's using its valuation to raise its valuation even when no actual new value is being created. If the platform were as awesome as everyone believes, Facebook wouldn't need to put their own money/reputation into funding people for it. But maybe I'm missing something.",1190123234

Now, I love what I do for a living, but really, generally speaking, the occupation does not bring me into contact with a lot of attractive and available young women. It is nothing like, say, being a photographer, a marketing or media exec, a fashion designer, a yoga instructor or a lifeguard. There are probably a hundred other such occupations. Better than all of them must be, ""straight male ballet dancer"" or running a dance company.""<p>Maybe you should all be starting your own dance company instead of a software start up?

There's one of two things happening here: <p>1) Hot or Not doesn't have the technical chops to reign in the spam.<p>2) Hot or Not isn't comfortable with the free dating model anymore, but wants to blame the switch back on something people might have sympathy for.<p>I actually would bet on the latter, but if it's the former (as they claim), I might be more worried about their future.",1190122752

Sometimes it might be version 23<p>For example, here's v2.0 of my idea.<p>Identity Life Insurance. For a fee, either use the internet and/or a physical inspection of people's computers after death to shut down online accounts and notify correspondents that you are deceased (and perhaps what to do about sending flowers, etc) This would give the insured privacy in their final online affairs and also make sure the people you chat with daily know what happened to you. Sales would be to traditional insurance companies (which could offer it as a rider) and funeral homes.<p>Now does that sound better? The fun of this game isn't necessarily in the idea, it's in the evolution of the idea in response to market forces. Cool stuff!",1190122083

Suddenly prevention programs would be worth the costs. The problem is that you couldn't switch if the insurer turned out to be really bad, or started to jack up prices.<p>By the way, this is basically how health care works in Europe - single payer 'socialist' health care: More cost-conscious, more prevention, everybody covered, less choice, lower quality for those who could afford it.",1190121605

While many of you saw how going free would be good, you also warned us that this would probably lead to more spammers and fake profiles.<p>You were right, this is exactly what happened. The spammers got aggressive to the point where they were screwing up the system, even causing the ""someone wants to meet you"" emails to not be sent for periods as long as 5 days.<p>We don't really regret trying to make the site free so everybody can use it, but it's clear that most of our users believe an inexpensive paid site works better than a free site filled with spammers.<p>If you left the site after we went free, we hope you'll come back and join again. If you are still here, we hope turning subscriptions back on has a noticable impact for you, helping you meet more people without having your time wasted by the spammers.<p>thanks, and have fun!<p>Your friends,

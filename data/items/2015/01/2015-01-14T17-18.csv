If you use Swift like a different syntax for Objective-C, it&#x27;s probably way faster to keep writing ObjC (because of the broken tooling).<p>If you can leverage other patterns, such as FP, you might be able to achieve a big speedup in writing Swift.<p>It also really depends on when you want to ship: if it&#x27;s a bit more long-term, Swift might be a better bet (I&#x27;m assuming that in a few years from now, almost all iOS apps will be written in Swift).

8887856,comment,8887493,8887493,0,0,bokonist,,,"Sam says &quot;<i>It amazes me that I can become relatively proficient on any subject I want, for free, from a $50 smartphone nearly anywhere in the world.</i>&quot; but he also says, &quot;<i>I think it’s most important to fix the broken parts of the current system, but also to decide we need to spend more money on education....Spending money on education, unlike most government spending, actually has an ROI—every dollar we spend on it ought to return more dollars in the future.</i>&quot;<p>So the cost of learning has become much cheaper ... but we need to spend even more money on education? Just because something is important does not mean you can spend money to improve it.<p>It is important to be healthy and strong. But there is literally no way I can spend more money than I do now to be substantially healthier or stronger. Once I spend enough to eat lots of meat and veggies, get some training on proper lift weighting form, get a gym membership with access to weights, etc, there is nothing else I can do.<p>The same goes for most forms of learning and skill improvement. Once you spend enough to pay for equipment and a few hours a week of mentorship, there is literally no way to spend more money to improve outcomes.<p>So my question for Sam is, what is the amount of money we need to spend to &quot;max out&quot; on learning? What specific things do we need to spend that money on?<p>Learning consists of four components:<p>1) book learning<p>2) practice<p>3) mentorship/coaching<p>4) motivation to do the above 3 things<p>As Sam points out, it costs very little money to grant access to an almost infinite amount of book learning. For #2, practice, you just need time. So you only need to spend enough to free someone from the need to work a job, so they have time to practice, you don&#x27;t have to spend much on the school itself. Component #4, motivation, is usually a matter of peer group, role models, and rational expectations, it shouldn&#x27;t need to cost money.<p>Component #3, mentorship, does cost money. However, the implication of &quot;spending more on education&quot; is usually that we should spend more money on schools and teachers. School teachers and professors, usually make very poor mentors, because they are not practitioners. In software, most people I know got much better practical mentorship on their first few years on the job, than they did in school.<p>So if we want to &quot;fix education&quot;, we need to get students good mentors. That would mean replacing our teachers and professors with practitioners who maybe spend a couple years on the job, then a year teaching, then a couple years on the job, etc. Or it would mean instituting an apprenticeship system, so people could learn in a workplace environment in a safe and productive way.<p><i>If the government wants more innovation, then it should stop cutting the amount of money it spends producing it.</i><p>It seems like every week there is new post in Hacker News about how broken the grant system is. If we want to spend more money on research, we also need to fix the funding system so that the money isn&#x27;t just going down a black-hole.<p><i>Target a real GDP growth rate.You build what you measure.  If the government wants more growth, set a target and focus everyone on hitting it.</i><p>Need to be very careful here. Futurists of the early 20th century thought that as technological progress advanced, more people could transition to activities of arts, craft, and leisure. If you target the GDP, or some new variation of GDP that still measures material output, you will make it official government policy to keep everyone on the treadmill, to produce more and more at the expense of transitioning to a art based economy.<p><i>One way to do this would be charge a decent-sized fee on every share traded (and have the fee go to the company); another would be a graduated tax rate that goes from something like 80% for day trades down to 10% for shares held for 5 years.</i><p>I agree with this. Another way to do it would be to simply enforce a 5% transaction tax on all stock sold within a year of buying it. That said, is there really anything preventing a CEO from just ignoring the ups and downs of the market?",1421258135

Alternatively, have the once function call a function in memory space that&#x27;s already set to execute only, to minimize the space attackers can perform shenanigans in.<p>However, this does kinda ignore one of the big focuses of the OpenBSD project. They tend to shy away from such clever hacks in the name of readability and auditability. While it&#x27;s definitely a neat way of ensuring your code is only executing once, it becomes a hassle when you have to port it to other platforms. Keep in mind that OpenBSD ports to as many platforms as possible because the subtle quirks of various platforms will often tickle out rare bugs to become more repeatable. In this case, your replacing the once function with a return is dependent on x86, so wouldn&#x27;t work on the many other platforms that OpenBSD runs in.",1421257872

It would be interesting to see a justification for this.<p>Very low growth and <i>capitalism</i> are a problematic combination if you believe Piketty, in the sense that the combination can become poisonous for democracy and many other values of the enlightenment.[0]<p>But I don&#x27;t see how democracy is necessarily incompatible with very low growth (or even a shrinking economy). Note that I still believe growth is a good thing regardless of this (unlike some people especially from an environmentalist bent), but it irks me when statements like this are thrown around with an unjustified air of authority.<p>Other than that, sama really misses the elephant in the room, which is plain old macroeconomics. This is more of a problem in Europe than in the US, but bad macroeconomic beliefs are pretty pervasive within the political elite, to the point where the same person will wring their hands asking for how to enable growth, but refuse to listen to what mainstream <i>academic</i> economists are saying (let alone heterodox academic economists).<p>[0] With the typical rate of growth below the typical rate of return on capital, society necessarily becomes more divided by wealth and poverty.",1421257742

This label becomes not much different than a column in database that is nullable.<p>Now things become more hairy when you realize that perhaps you want to keep more information about the actor so for example you want to change details.actor to details.actor.name. You will have two choices, either run through your database and modify all documents (which is something similar to RDBMS is doing) or write code to handle both cases. The second one seems easier, but as you&#x27;ll have more changes it&#x27;ll come back and bite you hard.<p>Later in the future you might realize that by repeating details about actor for every single movie you simply not only wasting a lot of resources (your database is bigger and slower) but also this affects integrity (in one movie perhaps you include actor&#x27;s middle name, or maybe you have a typo).<p>At that point you&#x27;ll start creating a collection that holds actors and then only store key of it in &quot;details.actors&quot;.

From personal experience, when I took alpha.2 and installed it on some of my test Dell servers, it automatically detected my hardware RAID without my having to jump through any driver disk hoops. That was huge for me.
* The move to a 3.10 kernel from kernel.org meant that we were out of the business of having a completely custom kernel and corresponding patch queue. Upstream is goodness.
* The move to the Xen Project hypervisor 4.4 meant that we&#x27;re now consuming the most stable version of the core hypervisor available to us.
* We&#x27;ve updated to an ovs 2.10 virtual switch giving us improved network stability when the virtual switch is under serious pressure. While we introduced the ovs way back in December of 2010, there remained cases where the legacy Linux bridge worked best. With Creedence, those situations should be very few and far between
* A thread per vif model was introduced to better ensure network hogs didn&#x27;t impact adjacent VM performance
* Network datapath optimizations allow us to drive line rate for 10Gbps NICs, and we&#x27;re doing pretty well with 40Gbps NICs.
* Storage was improved through an update to tapdisk3, and Felipe did a fantastic job of engaging with the community to provide performance details. Overall we&#x27;ve seen very significant improvements in aggregate disk throughput, and when you&#x27;re virtualizing it&#x27;s the aggregate which matters more than the single VM case.",1421257007

left margin indention then called <i>publication Algol</i>.<p>I was on the computer selection committee at FedEx, and
from what it had we were impressed with Algol, etc.
So a Burroughs system is what we recommended and got.<p>Alas, it was too slow.  Soon the computing was way, way
behind, and Big Blue got called in and got a really
big, new account.  The MVT/MVS family of operating systems,
with JCL, etc. was like an unanesthetized root canal 
procedure while undergoing a barbed wire enema, but it
could get the work done.<p>Generally that computing is having problems with
virus is a total bummer -- we should be able to
run malicious code safely.<p>Gee, Flash keeps telling
me their code is a security risk.  No joke!  And
that&#x27;s version 12 or so of their code.  Flash guys,
I&#x27;ve got more to do than be a lab rat running on a
wheel going &#x27;round and &#x27;round downloading code.<p>Yup, looks like Flash guys or someone was correct:
I spent all of December and part of January fighting
a virus on Windows:  Kept getting instances of
iexpore.exe running.  Yes, that is the EXE of
Windows Internet Explorer (IE).  So, I got those instances
even without starting IE.  So, I ran Microsoft&#x27;s latest
virus removal tools, days for each, and they found nothing.
The virus was still there.  So, I did a Windows
System Restore back to the earliest copy I had, 2 months
ago.  Seems to have worked.  But that was about six
weeks of virus mud wrestling for no good reason.<p>A simple Google search shows that discussions about
fighing that
iexplore.exe problem is all over the Web;
apparently it is a very common virus.<p>Flash guys, are you to blame for that one?<p>Flash guys:  Programming lesson 1 in Coding 101:
Check your input and detect any problems.  If the
input is not suitably <i>clean</i>, then 
refuse to use it.  If the specifications of
your input is too complicated for a check,
at least good checks while running, then
correct your specifications.  Flash guys,
I can understand one bug, but 12?  Are you
guys even trying, I mean trying to fix
bugs instead of pushing users to 
download?<p>And Microsoft guys, why do you let your code
let bad guys somewhere east of Moscow
mess up my computer?  You guys just like
shipping bugs?  Believe me, I do not
like fixing viruses.<p>As I recall, Multics was written in PL/I.  Prime
had a version of PL/I and used it for much of their
operating system.<p>Once Google ran a recruiting ad and I sent them a
resume.  I got a phone call from one of their
recruiters, and his big question was &quot;What is your
favorite programming language?&quot;<p>I said, &quot;PL/I&quot;.<p>Wrong answer!  Likely he was looking for C++.<p>Come on guy, I want to do something other than
fight memory leaks -- in PL/I if some work
is some part of my code <i>raises</i> an On Condition
(a software version of an interrupt, which 
might also have been from a hardware interrupt),
then in the code <i>block</i> that gets executed by
the On Unit that has been <i>established</i>
for that <i>condition</i>, can decide what to do
with the interrupt.  So, one thing to do is just
to kill off that work that raised the interrupt.
So, say that the block of the On Unit
that gets executed is X in code block B,
some code in block B did the function call
that got the work going, and just want to
kill off that work.  So, from block X just
do a Goto to the statement label want
in block B and not in block X, and presto, bingo, that
work is <i>killed off</i>, that is, wiped clean
by the wrath of <i>non-local Goto</i>.  So, in particular,
likely all the storage (all except <i>based</i>
storage) allocated by that worked to be killed
off is freed.  So, look, Ma, no memory leaks
from exceptional condition handling!<p>Google guys:  The original definition of C++
was just as a pre-processor to C.  And you want
to assume that that is a lot better than
what IBM, George Radin, etc. did with PL/I?
Do you have anyone who understands PL/I?",1421256827

What exactly is a “Framework”?  When does a library cross the boundary and become a Framework?  What is the original author’s definition of “develop software”?  That perspective matters here, because if what he’s saying is create a novel solution to a problem that hasn’t been solved before, that is a lot different from creating a webservice that inserts or retrieves some data from a database.  Frameworks are essentially just a tool to get the job done.  Some are better than others, and they come in all sizes. You really have to get specific to have a discussion like this that makes sense.  If I tasked a Java developer with building a webservice that took some information and put in a database, I could reasonably expect them to use some implementation of jax-ws or jax-rs.  If used properly those frame works are very powerful and convenient.  Most implementations are well documented, and the communities around them are vast and experienced.  Assuming the programmer was relatively experienced and had somehow never heard of either of those frameworks, I might expect some kind of servlet solution (arguably still a framework).  Now if what the author is saying is that building a webservice isn’t development, that’s a different discussion.  Many paths are heavily traveled. Using a Framework if you have to follow one of them is taking advantage of the knowledge gained by a large number of people that have already made the trip.",1421256565

Here&#x27;s the thing - depending on the existing code base, familiarity with a new framework may be the least of your problems.  If it takes a month to get used to django instead of rails, it can take several more to get used to the code base itself.  So you&#x27;re looking at a situation where a new programmer may not be highly productive for the first 5-6 months after hire.<p>To me, this does stretch the notion of &quot;fungibility.&quot; It means that if a programmer leaves a project, you may be looking at 6 months before any progress can be made - and that&#x27;s assuming you can find a talented enough programmer to get up to speed in the first place (<i>that</i> can take 6 months).  Often, a good previous developer will take copious notes, document well, ensure easy and clean build and test practices… that can reduce the ramp up time.  But a lot of this is just building a very elaborate blueprint for a system in your head.  Good practices can make it quicker and easier, but in the end, the transition just takes a lot of time.<p>There are tasks that would take a programmer with full context 1 week to complete.  Optimistically, it could take a new programmer 3 months + 1 week, and that&#x27;s for a well prepared programmer who understands the existing tech stack or something closely related.  Keep in mind there are are so many things about an organization to understand - existing database systems, services, security policies, auth systems.  The amount of context you have to build up can be massive.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s not a bad way to measure fungibility.  The ratio of how long it would take a current worker to complete a task vs a &quot;well prepared&quot; replacement.  1 week / 13 weeks ~ .077 fungibility.",1421256076

One negative experience was at a place struggling to fill positions and opened up to remote team members, but they did not change the company culture to support the remote members, and as a result all of the remote members were gone within a year or two and the experiment deemed &quot;a failure&quot;.<p>So I understand why some companies are reluctant to bring on remote members. It requires your entire company culture to change if you want a remote team member and not just someone used as basically contract labor. For a team used to making decisions and having conversations in person, it&#x27;s a big change to have to move everything online to include the remote person/s. It can breed resentment on both sides. In my negative experience I would find out decisions had been made days ago while the on-site team was out to lunch together, and no one had informed those of us working remotely.<p>Change is not easy.

8887513,comment,8886164,8886719,0,0,VikingCoder,,,"There are multiple problems.  The biggest problem in my mind is that outcomes are not tracked well.  That means that there&#x27;s no medical feedback loop to measure the long-term effectiveness of...  anything.  And no good way to do retrospective studies to prove new measurement techniques.  And also the laws for patient protection makes it incredibly difficult to get even anonymized data for researchers to use.<p>The next biggest problem is that there&#x27;s a gold standard of treatment, and it&#x27;s hard to get enough research to move the gold standard.  In this case, the gold standard is essentially a diameter measurement, based on picking the visibly largest slice of a data set which happens to have an axis determined by the patient&#x27;s somewhat random orientation in the CT scanner.  Axial, Coronal, Sagittal.  Those are not perfect, anatomical orientations - they&#x27;re rough.  Most radiologists won&#x27;t take the time to create Multi-Planar Reformats along oblique or double-oblique angles.  And even if they did, they&#x27;d still be eye-balling the measurement.<p>It&#x27;s not very hard from a regulatory standpoint to create tools to allow a radiologist to click here, click there, and show a measurement of distance.  Then the radiologist can look at a similar measurement from a different radiologist on the previous scan, and say whether it&#x27;s bigger or smaller now.  (But some PACS still don&#x27;t handle anisotropic MPR correctly, which just blows my mind.)<p>It&#x27;s vastly harder from a regulatory standpoint to say in a medical product for commercial use, &quot;Hey, we automatically measured the volume of this tumor by automatically finding the boundary of the tissue and automatically ignoring the connected blood vessels and neighboring bone, and then we automatically found the largest cross-sectional diameter, and then we automatically compared the same measurements against the automatically non-linearly-registered longitudinal previous scan... diagnosis: the tumor is not growing, just changing shape slightly.&quot;<p>People think their CT scans are examined for hours by a team of doctors, like on &quot;House.&quot;  In reality, you&#x27;re lucky if your CT scan gets 5 minutes of investigation, and that&#x27;s by a radiologist who was trained in med school to read X-Rays, not CT.  And your oncology head CT may be read by a radiologist who specializes in abdominal pediatric Ultrasound.  And there&#x27;s almost certainly no double-reading for Quality Assurance.  And there&#x27;s no rating on radiologists to tell you who has the most accurate diagnosis.  And he&#x27;s probably using 2D measuring tools on 3D data - because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re familiar with, and that&#x27;s what the reconstruction software manufacturers provide, and that&#x27;s the medical gold standard.  On a shared computer, where some other radiologist (or resident!) might have changed the display settings in a way he didn&#x27;t notice.

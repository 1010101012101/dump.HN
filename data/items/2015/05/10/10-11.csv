His next candidate t half-fixes this, and again looking at the graph of the relative error makes it clear that it&#x27;s right. (Note that avoiding intervals containing zero will indeed allow you to get better max relative errors -- keeping the relative error finite where the function is zero effectively reduces your polynomial degree by 1.) Then finally he fully fixes it with the polynomial g, solving the more interesting problem of minimizing the max relative error for the log function everywhere, and chooses a better functional form by shifting the interval he reduces to with the polynomial s.<p>(The fact that his earlier polynomials do the wrong thing is clearly not a mistake but a paedagogical strategy: start with something simple and incrementally improve it.)<p>My apologies for spelling all this out, but it really appears that you&#x27;re accusing him of making elementary mistakes without actually understanding what he&#x27;s doing.<p>&quot;Imposing that errors should vanish at certain points&quot; is not a mistake, it&#x27;s a necessity if you&#x27;re implementing log by argument reduction plus local approximation and you care about relative error in the resulting approx_log function, and you are getting better numbers than Goldberg by solving the wrong problem.<p>Your (2,2) rational approximant will be much more expensive to compute than the polynomial and won&#x27;t yield the speed gains Goldberg is looking for.

In early 1990s, after rigorous research, \n    that he felt bold enough to go public with his new thesis. The reward  \n    system, he then asserted, has two distinct elements: wanting and\n    liking (or desire and pleasure). While dopamine makes us want, the\n    liking part comes from opioids and also endocannabinoids (a version of\n    marijuana produced in the brain), which paint a “gloss of pleasure”,\n    as Berridge puts it, on good experiences. His most telling discovery\n    was that, whereas the dopamine/wanting system is vast and powerful, \n    the pleasure circuit is anatomically tiny, has a far more fragile\n    structure and is harder to trigger.&quot;\n\n    Potential clinical applications are always on his mind. His revelation\n    that desire and dread share the same brain operations, like two sides\n    of the same coin, could help ease schizophrenia symptoms. Iggy Pop\n    1998 album “Live on the King Biscuit Flower Hour” was used in\n    conjunction with bright lights to generate dread in the rats for these\n    experiments. (It worked.) A trial drug has had some success in\n    reducing delusions by restricting a certain dopamine neuron that\n    produces fear.\n</code></pre>\nIt goes on with an interview with and text about Berridge and his research. Including details of how his 1986 study started with &quot;failed&quot; lab tests. Further there are discussions with Kringelbach and his collaborations with Berridge and own research.<p><pre><code>    In spring 2014, Kringelbach and colleagues from Oxford and Aarhus\n    released a research paper on groove –music that makes people want to\n    get up and dance and is, as the study puts it, “frequently observed\n    in…funk, hip-hop and electronic dance music”.\n\n</code></pre>\nThey discuss Kringelbach Baby likeness test which splits on gender under one condition but equalizes under a less subjective condition. It briefly mentions the Stanford Lust and Loathing study (quote from study[1]):<p><pre><code>    We show how being “jilted”—that is, being thwarted from obtaining a\n    desired outcome—can concurrently increase desire to obtain the\n    outcome, but reduce its actual attractiveness. Thus, people can come\n    to both want something more, yet like it less\n</code></pre>\n1. <a href=""https://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/khan/documents/jilting.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/khan/documents/jilting.pdf</a>",1431252416

And if I look at the moon and say &quot;that is part of a fox&quot; I am using the language incorrectly.<p>Of course the word &quot;alive&quot; is ambiguously defined semantics applying to a loose hodgepodge of phenomenon (is a virus alive?). It may be convenient to use, just like the term &quot;sunrise&quot; is useful. But looking for the real phenomenon behind it is like looking for the caloric fluid or the land north of the north pole, they are words for ideas invented long before we knew much about anything.<p>Your notion too might be useful, that everything is part of a single grouping like the observable universe. But I think we&#x27;d be in error to suppose there is something real to either of these groupings beyond being useful names.",1431252011

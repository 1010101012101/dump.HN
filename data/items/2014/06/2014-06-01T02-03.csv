Also, my right thumb is near the top of the phone in the way I tend to hold it, and I type with the 3 non-pinky fingers on my left hand. This makes me a bit odd.<p>2. Same. In TextSecure, hit options, add contact info, and it adds to contacts. You can pick an existing contact or add a new one by hitting the big + sign.<p>3. Opening something with an app &quot;just once&quot; vs opening it with that app &quot;always&quot; and he complains that it doesn&#x27;t save the preference. Clearly he read the words, but didn&#x27;t understand. &quot;Just once&quot; means use that app just once. &quot;always&quot; means use that app always.<p>4 & 5. No. Apps in the background may appear to be running, but they can be simply suspended. You do not have to care about what is running in the background, the task scheduler takes care of it. Let it predict what you&#x27;ll load, things will be fast, and your battery life won&#x27;t suffer nearly as much as he seems to think. Most of the battery drain will be the screen and the radios anyway. This simply isn&#x27;t something you have to care about, or should have to care about.<p>That said, if you want to care about it and tweak it, go ahead. There are apps for that, and things like AutoKiller which changes the task scheduler&#x27;s behavior to make it work better for you.<p>6. TextSecure. I agree that the default messaging app is poor.<p>7. Agreed, though I&#x27;ve never had this issue. May be another instance of #3.<p>8. Agreed, I use AnySoft keyboard. Unlike other OSes, you can change the keyboard.<p>Android in its default config is OK. Far from perfect, but unlike iOS it&#x27;s much easier to make it perfect.",1401591319

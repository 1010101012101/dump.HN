8912394,comment,8910074,8911239,0,0,graycat,,,"In the US, 900 miles was just from\nwhere I was in DC, north to\nPennsylvania, west to\nOhio, across Ohio to Indiana,\nsouth to the town Fort Wayne in\nNE Indiana, west to Warsaw, IN,\nand then south 15 miles to the\nfarm of the family of my \ngirlfriend and, later, wife.\nSo, before we were married,\nI drove the 900 miles often,\ncommonly mostly at 90+ MPH,\nand after we were married\ndrove it usually at least once\na year, at Christmas.<p>When we went for Christmas, we \nwere carrying\nway too much stuff to fly or take\na train!  And when we got there, we\nstayed for a few days and still wanted\nour car to get around, to restaurants,\nmovies, friends, more shopping, etc.<p>In Europe, they think that a car engine\nwith 3.0 liters of displacement is\nlarge.  The engine I was using had\neither 5.7 liters of displacement\nor, in two cases, \n6.5 liters of displacement.<p>US and Europe do some things in\ndifferent ways!<p>That part of Indiana is sparsely\npopulated.  So, from the farm, the\nnearest airport with much in\nservice is at Fort Wayne\nabout 50 miles away.<p>Let&#x27;s see:  The 6.5 liter car I used\nmost often had a 2.56 rear axle ratio\nand at 90+ MPH got about 18 MPG.\nGas cost about $0.25 a gallon.\nThen the cost of gas for the 900 miles was<p><pre><code>     900 * 0.25 / 18 = 12.50\n</code></pre>\ndollars, $25 round trip.  Heck\njust the taxi fare from the\nFort Wayne airport to the\nfarm would have been about that.\nTo use a plane or train, round\ntrip, would have meant four long\ntaxi trips, total cost much more\nthan the gasoline for driving\nmy car.<p>For trains, actually at one time\nthe US had one heck of a rail network\nwith relatively good passenger service.\nMostly the rails are still in the ground.\nActually the little cross road town\nthree miles from the farm did have\na rail line and a station -- not\nused by passengers, if at all, \nin years.  Sure, at one time\ncould have caught a train at that station\nand, with\nlots of transfers, gone to\nChicago, New York, San Francisco, etc.\nLots of transfers and then\nwaiting between trains.<p>In simple terms, in the US, by about 1955 or so,\ncars put the passenger trains out of\nbusiness.  The US still has one\nheck of a good freight rail network.<p>While Indiana is sparsely populated,\nkeep going west to\nIowa, Nebraska, South Dakota,\nWyoming, Montana, Idaho,\netc., and we&#x27;re talking miles and miles\nand miles of hardly \na person in sight.<p>In the US, there&#x27;s density enough\nfor trains to have a shot\nbetween, say, Richmond, VA north\nto DC, Baltimore, Newark, NYC,\nGreenwich, Stamford,\nHartford, and Boston.  And we do\nhave such trains; spent a lot of money\non the trains; our VP Biden spent\na lot of time on those trains\nbetween Baltimore and DC;\nbut those trains lose money.\nAnd parallel to those tracks we\nhave airplanes -- maybe they\nmake money, but the TSA has\nmade airplanes a little less\ncomfortable than either an\nunanesthetized root canal procedure or\na barbed wire enema.\n&quot;Open wide, look at the birdie,\nand then grab your ankles and\nback up to the officer ....\nHave a pleasant trip.&quot;<p>&quot;Next time it&#x27;s my car;\neven for 2000 miles.&quot;<p>In the US there\nare lots of other efforts\nto spend big bucks to have\ntrains across the Midwest,\nnorth and south along the west\ncoast, e.g., LA to SF and maybe\nup to Seattle, maybe\nbetween Houston and Dallas in\nTX, etc.  Lots of efforts.  For\ndecades.<p>For commuters to NYC, NY has\ntrains north to Poughkeepsie\nand NE to Greenwich, Stamford,\nHartford, or some such.\nAt least the one to Poughkeepsie\nhas been losing money, and now\nwhen register a car in that area\nhave to pay a special tax to\nsupport the trains.<p>How do we pay for roads, bridges, etc. for cars?  \nWe&#x27;re supposed\nto be covering that out of gasoline\ntaxes, which are not trivial.\nThe result is called the <i>Highway Trust Fund</i>;\nit may have a stack of IOUs from\n<i>loans</i> for other purposes.<p>I live 70 miles north of\nthe Wall Street area which is at the southern\ntip of Manhattan in NYC\nand for a while worked \nin that area.  I found that\nexcept in the worst of the rush hour,\nmy car was, door to door, faster\nthan the trains.  And I was not\nusing a high performance car.<p>Apparently the NYC subways work\nwell -- I can believe that.\nBut Baltimore put in a subway,\nand while I was at Johns Hopkins University\nthere in Baltimore, once was in a lecture\nthat analyzed the <i>welfare economics</i>\nof the Baltimore subway; <i>welfare economics</i>\nis where\nadd up all the costs and all the\nbenefits and see for what projects\nthe total of the benefits\nis greater than the total of the costs.\nThe lecture reported the totals of the\ncosts and the benefits,\nand the costs were higher than\nthe benefits.  So, from the\npoint of view of <i>welfare economics</i>,\nthe <i>optimal</i> decision, given\nthat the subway construction was\ndone, was just to brick up the\nentrances and f&#x27;get about it.\nOr, if there were some really\ngood <i>benefits</i> for that subway,\nadding up the <i>value</i> of the\nbenefits still didn&#x27;t have the\nbenefits exceed the costs.\nThat&#x27;s what happened in that\ncase; just why I don&#x27;t know.<p>Drawing from several decades of\nrecent history, broadly,\npassenger trains don&#x27;t work\nvery well in the US.  There are\nlots and lots and lots of\npeople who very much want\npassenger trains to work well\nhere, but the <i>golden age</i>\nof US passenger trains was\nfrom, say, 1930 to 1955 or so.\nE.g., there are several Hollywood\nmovies, <i>North by Northwest</i>,\n<i>The Sting</i>, that show something about what\ntrain travel was like then.\nBasically in the US, the long distances,\nlow population density,\nInterstate highway system\n(Ike regarded as crucial for\nmilitary logistics for\nUS national security),\netc. shot the passenger trains\nbetween the eyes.  One biggie\nreason:  People already owned\na car, say, just to get to\nthe grocery store, the coin\nlaundry (people commonly\nhad cars before they had\nwasher/driers at home),\nschools, friends, etc.<p>Another factor was that\ntrains had a bad\nreputation because at one\ntime they were seen as\nexploitative monopolies.\nTo push back, we got the\nInterstate Commerce Commission\n(ICC) with a lot of economic\nregulation of the trains.\nIf a road needed a bridge over some\ntrain tracks, then maybe the\ntrain company was asked to pay for it.\nThe unions saw the train companies\nas soft targets and, with the\nhelp of Congress, took advantage.\nSo, by 1955 or so, many people\nin the US regarded passenger trains\nas something they would like never\nto see again.<p>So, for the 900 miles to\nGrandma&#x27;s for Christmas,\nwith lots of luggage,\npresents, camera equipment,\nand on and on, and the\ndesire for a car when get there,\nthe cost was really just the\ndirect marginal operating cost, so I and \nnearly everyone else with a car\ntook their car.\nE.g., when I drove that 900 miles,\nit was less than five miles from\nmy apartment to an Interstate highway,\nand then I was on Interstate highways\nor similar for all but the\nlast 15 miles where the\ntraffic was very light and the\nroads fine.<p>Yes, people have thought of the\nidea of having a car drive onto\na special car of a train and then let the\ntrain do the driving while the\npeople sat in the car, listened\nto the radio, now watched \na movie on a laptop with a DVD,\ntalked, etc.  Didn&#x27;t work --\nnot enough people came.<p>Since the 1950s, the US has\nhad a <i>love affair</i> with \ncars.<p>Europe and the US\nhave some significant differences.<p>Actually, for shorter distances,\nthere are good intercity bus\nlines in the US.  Typically\ncan get to/from a smaller\ncity easier on bus than\ntrain or plane.<p>As I recall, all of Germany\nis smaller than just the\nsmaller US state of Oregon.<p>There are a lot of places in the\nworld where distances are \nlarge and population density low;\nwe will see what they do about\npassenger transportation --\nMongolia, Siberia, Alaska,\nmost of Africa, most of Canada,\nmost of South America, \nmuch of South Asia around, say,\nAfghanistan, etc.",1421683158

8912388,comment,8911021,8912036,0,0,jroll,,,"> This deeper failure is In the incentives for Rackspace to withhold key commits on Ironic from the community because they feel it is secret sauce. (I am taking the OP&#x27;s version of the tale at face value). They&#x27;re one of the flagship supporters of OpenStack, and their behavior is perceptably a big reason for its failures to date.<p>I&#x27;m an Ironic core reviewer and work on OnMetal at Rackspace.<p>At Rackspace, we run ahead of Ironic trunk. It&#x27;s true that we haven&#x27;t been super vigilant about upstreaming our patches into Ironic; this is not because it&#x27;s &quot;secret sauce&quot;, not because we don&#x27;t care. Priorities are hard, both upstream and downstream.<p>OpenStack moves slowly compared to a team developing proprietary software. This is a well-known fact. We do our best to upstream our patches as quickly as the project allows, but they often need to be improved to work with other hardware/drivers/etc.<p>For example, when we launched in July, we already had support for &quot;cleaning&quot; a server - erasing disks, flashing firmware, etc. The &quot;spec&quot; for the new feature was first posted upstream June 25, 2014.[0] This spec finally landed last January 16, 2015.<p>Our work on improving network support in Ironic has been similar; the project hasn&#x27;t been ready for it (again, priorities). It&#x27;s been done in the open[1], but the code is not in Ironic trunk yet.<p>We&#x27;ve been extremely open about what we&#x27;re doing since we joined the Ironic project almost a year ago; I&#x27;m curious which patches the article has in mind.<p>As an Ironic developer, this article bums me out a bit, but it&#x27;s a good pointer as to what we&#x27;re doing poorly. /me starts writing better docs<p>[0] <a href=""https://review.openstack.org/#/c/102685/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://review.openstack.org/#/c/102685/</a> \n[1] <a href=""https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ironic-neutron-bonding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ironic-neutron-bonding</a>",1421683082

8912332,story,,,41,37,tluyben2,"Ask HN: How do we find an investor in the EU/UK for something very technical?",,"Some history:<p>We have spent a large portion of our daily company time developing something like Apportable for apps, not games. We tried Apportable on multiple occasions and it&#x27;s too game focused. Our clients all want Android apps but basically don&#x27;t want to pay for them or spend time on them, for them, iOS is the first class citizen, Android comes far behind that and the rest is usually not even mentioned. Especially line of business apps are very much like: make the iOS perfect and &#x27;the rest&#x27; (as much as you can do fast/cheap) should be done, but don&#x27;t bother us with it.<p>Status:<p>We compile the iOS apps we build to Android and release them; we currently also have alpha versions for WP8 & HTML5 which work well enough. But we need to do it (just like Apportable by the way) currently; we &#x27;fix&#x27; our library when there are methods / classes missing. We allow, in quite intuitive ways, to use the native API&#x27;s where clients want/need to.<p>Future:<p>We would like to finish this so it can be sold online, maybe as a service or download; currently it&#x27;s sold together with every project we build and that works well but the money from that is not enough to &#x27;finish&#x27; this into a product. To finish that entire phase and start selling worldwide (instead of project based, which, by the way, is still a lot cheaper than doing an Android implementation yourself) we need more money then we can fund ourselves. We are situated in Europe and the investors (mostly angels) we speak to either have no clue what this is or how much upside it has or offer far too small amounts for too much % (usually actually less money than we can make ourselves selling it in a month or two which is just not enough to invest in it).<p>What would be a good route for us to finding the right people?  It does not have to be in the EU/UK, but that seems the most likely option.",1421682344

I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s <i>right</i> jus that it is.<p>> What evidence shows the unsatisfiability is even there?<p>The only specific study that I remember off-the-cuff is the one mentioned here [1] (search for &quot;Mike Norton&quot;), but, of course, I think this &quot;unsatisfiabilty&quot; is what brought us here to begin with.

In fact, most people are happy some of the time, and some people are happy most the time, but I don&#x27;t think all people can be happy all -- or even most -- of the time. It&#x27;s quite possible that people&#x27;s happiness depends on others&#x27; misery.

The firewall that I installed was set to auto-negotiate and since the ISP&#x27;s equipment was hard-coded, the firewall negotiated at 100/Half-duplex.  If you&#x27;re not familiar with what half-duplex means, basically it means that you can still send & receive data, but you can only do one at a time -vs- full-duplex where you can send and receive at the same time.  The problem with a speed test is that the download test only downloads, and the upload test only uploads, so in the case of the duplex mismatch, the speed test looked fine.  As soon as users came in the next morning and put the internet connection under load, they began complaining about internet speeds and we realized that we had a problem with the duplex settings.<p>Another way to test is a utility called iperf, but it&#x27;s a lot more complicated and requires you to have access to the remote machine. - <a href=""https://iperf.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://iperf.fr/</a>",1421680096

1233679,comment,1233530,1233530,0,0,jsz0,,,"It seems obvious the iPad is directly aimed at the larger net book market instead of the relatively small digital reader market. Not many people are going to carry and iPad <i>and</i> a laptop. If the iPad is a device you buy instead of a net book, which by extension is a device you buy instead of a larger more functional laptop, Apple may not have an uphill battle here. Net book customers have already decided they don't want to spend $1k+ on a laptop, they can live without an optical drive, they can adapt to a small awkward keyboard, etc. In other words they are people who have already started to abandon the idea of a computer as being a fully functional all encompassing device in favor of form factor, price, and portability. So I think Apple clearly has a big market but they'll have to stress the things the iPad does better than a net book. Multi-touch web browsing, gaming, better battery life, better build quality/design, easier to use, no malware/spyware problems, etc. They'll need to quickly fill in the remaining gaps of functionality before customers have the dreaded ""oh it doesn't do <i>that</i>?"" experience.",1270090111

1233651,comment,1233075,1233294,0,0,strlen,,,"Project Voldemort uses BerkeleyDB Java Edition as one of the storage engines (the most frequently used one). Java Edition differs from the C version in being log-structured (very fast writes, at the cost of somewhat slower reads). In one deployment, we're able to store ~130 gb per node data (each node having 32 gb of memory, 18gb of it going to JVM heap, 10gb of the JVM heap going to BDB cache), while having average <i>read</i> latency times (which include the overhead of decoding a request packet) of <1 ms (with some outliers due to large value sizes, etc...).<p>I should add, this is also while using a single bdb environment for all partitions that belong to a node -- note the most efficient way to store this data (bdb je 4.0 does support sharing a cache between multiple environments, so we might move to separate environment per partition model). We've also built the distribution layer ourselves, rather than use the built-in HA features, but if I recall correctly, the first version of Amazon SimpleDB (prior to Erlang re-write) was built with BDB-JE HA (not to be confused with Amazon Dynamo, which is built on regular BDB-JE and provides its own distribution mechanisms).<p>Overall, we've found that BDB-JE performs <i>best</i> when there's 1:5 ratio between memory and data set size. With JE (as opposed to classic BDB) the issues are: Java implies a certain vertical scalability limit (due to GC pauses with very large heap sizes, however the GC does get better with every release), log-structured B+Tree is <i>great</i> for writes, but might mean more seeks being made for reads (especially if you were to use range query functionality).<p>Licensing might be an issue if you're <i>shipping a commercial product to customer site</i>. It doesn't matter if it's used on your own servers or in an open source project (and unlike GPL, the BerkeleyDB license is compatible with Apache licensed projects). The licensing also doesn't apply to Perl/Ruby/Python/other dynamic language bindings for BerkeleyDB, you're free to package them (and then request the customer to install BerkeleyDB themselves, much like you would with MySQL).<p>In short, it's a great solution if you fit its use case. I should also add that interacting with the Sleepycat people online (e.g., on the forums) also makes you forget they're a part of Oracle.",1270089111

This is a community with many high-end programmers who probably look at your project and think that they could easily recreate it in less than $10k worth of time (probably not true, but whatever).<p>My immediate reaction is that you need to ditch your eternal beta and immediately offer a paid plan. Make the trial really limited. Talk (in person) to potential clients and really try to really sell this thing.<p>As long as it is in eternal free beta you have no real discernment between casual and paying customers. You have no money to make it worthwhile to you, you have no advertising budget and no credibility.

My service can do 300 search requests/second sustained off of one machine. That's with a pretty minimal setup. Data is backed up to S3. Multi-homing isn't a big priority for me, but I could easily do it for not much effort/cost.<p>2. If you're whitelisted, Twitter actually gives out 14.4 million calls a month for free. If not, it's 111,600 calls per month. So, I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers here.<p>3. I've spent a lot of time building my service and API, but AFAICT you're not providing an API I could vend directly to client applications I don't own myself. Ditto on the premium content, which I can almost guarantee you don't have the rights to give re-vending access for. (As in, I can't build a weather API service on it and charge money. Same for business info.)<p>4. How many of those POIs are license-free? Also, half a terabyte of point data would be a lot, if you were actually indexing that much. I'd wager $1 you're counting non-point data in that number, such as addresses and the like. That said, this is probably your strongest point,<p>5. That's cool. It took me awhile to write my mapping engine, and I haven't started on my AR view yet.<p>Honestly, your biggest problem seems to be that you don't describe your service very well. If I were you, I'd be pitching this as a good way to build up a service without the knowledge required to build a geo API in house, negotiating with geodata vendors directly (who can be extremely standoffish and unreasonable), and monitoring/scaling/etc the geodata side of things.<p>Also, the things I'd like to see, so that I don't have to build them myself, would be:<p>1. Worldwide address geocoding with no usage restrictions. AFAICT, this service does not exist.<p>2. Worldwide address canonicalization. If I'm missing a postal code, province, etc, or if a phone number is in a weird format, I'd love a service that would clean that up for me.<p>3. Address unification among services. I'd love to be able to tie together the primary ids of a given address among the various services: Yelp, foursquare, Gowalla, OpenStreetMap, etc.",1270087355

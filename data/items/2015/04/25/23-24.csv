9439942,comment,9438819,9438819,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"The one thing I disagree with in this is the point about an office. Having an office matters. Being visible from behind sucks, and the open-plan stress means that you spend an unacceptable amount of your leisure time recovering from work instead of actually doing things. I&#x27;d gladly take a 10% pay cut not to deal with that. I don&#x27;t give a shit about having a <i>nice</i> office. I&#x27;d be fine with 50 square feet and a small window.<p>As a programmer, I&#x27;d want an office just to have some space where I can get work done. That&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m a true believer or a corporate man. It&#x27;s entirely selfish: my career will be better if I succeed than if I fail, and these terrible open-plan offices do enough damage to day-to-day performance that I&#x27;d rather not be in one. Though I&#x27;m a Sociopath/opportunist I generally find that it&#x27;s usually in my interest to work hard, do my best, and play fair. In a conflict, I&#x27;ll favor my interests above almost anyone else&#x27;s, but I also avoid such conflicts as much as I can.<p>Other than that, I think that the carnival cash metaphor is spot-on. Moreover, I think the spawning issue (i.e. that sociopaths/opportunists don&#x27;t usually start at the top) is worth note in technology because it&#x27;s such a young industry. The age discrimination and the Scrum nonsense are all about creating a permanent culture of the clueless/idealist mindset-- at all levels. The VC-funded ecosystem is one where the Sociopaths get to play multiple companies (as investors, advisors, and executives placed into successful companies after the fact) and the checked-out MacLeod Losers (pragmatists) are shut out by the time they wise up. The goal is to produce monochromatically Clueless/idealist companies that the Sociopaths/opportunists in VC can manage from a distance and discard if they become inconvenient.",1430005481

9439930,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,mikekchar,,,"After 20 odd years as a programmer, I quit my job with the intention of spending 1 year teaching English in Japan.  My main reason for doing it was that I wanted to learn Japanese and I felt that there weren&#x27;t enough hours in the day to do it in Canada.  I&#x27;m very risk averse, so I wanted to make sure that I had a job and a place to live.  I was accepted into the JET Programme (I was 39 at the time -- the cut off age!).  At the time, I had all the trappings of a successful developer: car, house, mountains of things in the house.  I packed a backpack and let some friends live in my house rent free so that there was someone to look after it.<p>After 3 months in Japan, I knew I never wanted to go back to Canada.  Eventually, I asked one of my friends to sell my house (<i>that&#x27;s</i> one hell of a favour!) and got them to give away all my worldly possessions.  I loved teaching English, although I was completely unqualified for it and it took me a few years before I was at all competent.  My job was only 35 hours a week so I had lots of time to write code in my spare time and I did so almost every day.  I learned Japanese fluently and even got married to a Japanese woman who didn&#x27;t speak much English at the time.  I stayed there for the entire 5 years that was available on my teaching contract.<p>After that, my wife wanted to go somewhere so that she could learn English.  I was feeling quite a bit more confident at this point that the moving thing would work out... somehow, but I&#x27;m still very risk averse ;-)  I managed to get an entry permit for myself and my wife through my English ancestry which allowed us to work in the country and we just went.  We budgeted $30K for a year and in the case that I couldn&#x27;t find a programming job I had a startup plan.  I didn&#x27;t have to worry as I found a job within a month.<p>Before we left, I warned my wife that it might turn out like it did when I went to Japan: that we would live in England for ever.  We went with that view in mind and gave away/sold the things we had in Japan (except for a few things which we left at her mother&#x27;s house).  I, especially, was down to again owning nothing that I couldn&#x27;t carry by myself.  We stayed for 2 years (to the day!), but eventually decided to return to Japan to help look after my wife&#x27;s mother who is getting older.  I am now working remotely on contract for the same company that I was working for in London.  We are very happy in Japan and don&#x27;t plan to move again, but who knows.<p>For advice: You probably don&#x27;t need to be as risk averse as me.  Things will probably &quot;just work out... somehow&quot;.  I really, really liked staying in the 2 places for years on end.  I have to say that I don&#x27;t like travelling, per se, but I have really enjoyed living and becoming part of a community in another place in the world.  Also, spending the time to learn Japanese and to learn a new trade has completely changed my life for the better.  And I got married (which is actually a bit of a miracle to be honest).<p>In the 5 years that I was away from a programming job, things changed in the industry quite a bit.  Also, getting a programming job in a new part of the world meant that I didn&#x27;t have any contacts and the popular technology was quite different.  Even though I programmed every day on my own, my technical level dropped by a fair bit.  I had one especially bad job interview where I am sure I looked like a complete idiot because I couldn&#x27;t do anything.  But I ended up with a great job, probably precisely because I found someone who was willing to give me a chance to prove myself.<p>One of the responses here says to &quot;plan to return&quot;.  As you can see, I went the other way.  I planned not to return.  Either way can be good, but I agree whole heartedly that you need a plan because it can be an emotional roller coaster ride.  If you plan to return, realize that your friends will have moved on in their lives, your job probably won&#x27;t be there waiting for you, and <i>you</i> will fundamentally change.   It will be like another new place.<p>Other people seem to be saying similar things about the things you have accumulated over time.  You don&#x27;t need/want it.  Except for a few things that have incredible sentimental value, get rid of it all.  Trust me.  Having to get rid of your stuff while you are thousands of miles away is not a thing that you want to experience.  Get rid of it before you go.  If you can&#x27;t easily carry it, then it is useless.<p>One strange, but I think important piece of advice: don&#x27;t break local laws.  I have been really, really careful, but I have met people who have had problems with the law in Japan.  Things don&#x27;t work abroad the way they work where you live.  Even minor things that would be overlooked where you live now could be a HUGE hassle for you in a different country.<p>A big one for that is if you intend to get a job in the country you are visiting, get the proper visa.  Many times you can get away without the visa and it will be fine.  The times where you don&#x27;t get away with it?  It will not be fine at all -- especially if you like travelling.  Spending weeks, perhaps months in a holding cell (which you have to pay a large fee for) until they deport you, and then having a huge problem ever travelling anywhere again...  This is really not good.<p>I have a few friends now who work remotely for  overseas companies while they travel.  This can work really well if you plan things well (don&#x27;t assume you will have good internet access/power!!!)  Remote working is quite difficult, but also rewarding.  That is a whole topic to itself.<p>My last piece of advice is to get comfortable with the idea that you will change on your trip.  Circumstances will force you to be a different person.  This has worked out really well for me and for many other people I know, but it can be shattering for some people.  The &quot;success&quot; of the trip will depend more on how flexible you can be rather than how much you have prepared in advance.",1430005179

9439909,comment,9434564,9437530,0,0,lotharbot,,,"Some thoughts:<p>1) McDonalds and other large minimum wage employers know what a minimum-skilled employee is worth to their bottom line, and they set prices accordingly.  They know that after a wage bump they&#x27;ll have reduced turnover of their better employees, but they also know that when they do have turnover, that new unskilled employee is worth 1.6 big macs per hour, so they&#x27;ll raise prices as quickly as they can to compensate.  The net result is inflation, and <i>inflation destroys any purchasing-power increase</i> the minimum wage creates.  (My own research suggests this takes about 2 years to fully play out.)<p>2) Increased unemployment right after minimum wage increases might be one of the sources of &quot;general economic recession&quot;, rather than (as you imply) one of the consequences.  Based on my own research, the unemployment bump actually tends to start about 3 months prior to a minimum-wage bump (as companies slow new hiring), peaks 3-6 months after, and then decreases inverse to price increases/inflation.<p>3) when people are unemployed, taxpayers pay 100% of their expenses.  When they work for the minimum wage, they earn N% and taxpayers pay 100-NxS% (where S is the scaling factor for how quickly benefits are lost in relation to outside income; S should be less than 1.)  But in light of points 1 and 2, someone can only get a job if N < their value to some company.  So if the minimum wage N is set high enough, it forces people out of the economy <i>long term</i> (because if they&#x27;re unemployed, they&#x27;re not gaining work experience, and therefore they&#x27;re not increasing their value.)<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that setting the minimum too low is self-correcting (because of turnover and the existence of systems like welfare), while setting the minimum too high is the cause of significant unemployment.  So I&#x27;d rather err on the low side, pairing a low minimum wage with strong welfare and related benefits.",1430004706

Companies tend to oscillate between rank cultures and tough cultures. A rank culture is one where subordinacy is all that matters; don&#x27;t piss off your boss, don&#x27;t create the appearance of slacking (which will cause problems for your boss) and you&#x27;ll be fine. Rank cultures tend to decay, and then the company has to bring in HR brownshirts who impose stack ranking and calibration curves and the like. That&#x27;s not stable, though, and the people who figure out the system and can extend protection become the new holders of rank and, they, like their predecessors, care more about loyalty than individual performance.

In reality, it&#x27;s often not more current than the released version. If there is a new version of a package in sid, why isn&#x27;t it in the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; ubuntu next-release? (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good reason)<p>I&#x27;m not closely following Ubuntu development, but they have 6 month release cycles and they do the &quot;sync from sid&quot; early in the cycle, AFAIK first 3 months or so, so you can expect 15.10 to have what was in sid on August-ish. This may further skew when<p>1. Debian is on freeze. For example, Debian was on freeze starting from November &#x27;14, which means practically sid was also on freeze. Debian import freeze date for Ubuntu 15.04 was February [0], so while normally you would expect 15.04 to have latest versions of february; in reality they were latest versions of october. (there are, of course, exceptions). When you consider import freeze of 14.10 was August &#x27;14 [1], you can see why 14.10 and 15.04 have very similar versions.<p>2. Ubuntu is importing from testing for LTS releases, instead of sid. This shouldn&#x27;t matter in an ideal world, where the difference between testing and unstable is 5-10 days, but sometimes packages got stuck in sid so bad that it may cause a difference in what lands in Ubuntu release.<p>3. I&#x27;m not so sure on that but if I understand correctly, they do a complete import of Debian in the beginning of the release cycle, and then maintainers can do ad-hoc imports for individual packages until the import freeze date, so the packages that land in the release may also be older than what was on sid near the import freeze date.<p>I guess you&#x27;ll see much newer packages on 15.10, though, since sid will be full-speed during the 15.10 cycle, so nothing to worry about for now :)<p>0: <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VividVervet/ReleaseSchedule"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VividVervet/ReleaseSchedule</a><p>1: <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseSchedule"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseSchedule</a>",1430004193

9439869,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,aidos,,,"I&#x27;ve done a few 3-4 month trips in the past. I was fortunate to be earning a good day rate as a freelancer before I left and I was young, with no responsibilities and no need for a life plan. It was easy to quickly save up a little money, and travel can be really cheap, especially when you don&#x27;t care about sleeping in a nice bed.<p>The first couple of times I travelled a lot. Too much. Moving on every day or two. Seeing the various famous sites to see along the way. It was a great adventure, but I didn&#x27;t learn that much.<p>One day I was talking to someone on my daily train commute out of london and she was telling me about a friend of hers that was travelling the world by boat. I thought it sounded amazing, and I always wanted to sail, so I booked myself in to do a leg of the Clipper Ventures [0] yacht race - from Liverpool (England) to Brazil (took about 4 weeks).<p>When I arrived in Brazil I didn&#x27;t have a plan at all. I booked in to learn Portuguese while stating with a local family. The 4 weeks I lived there changed the way I look at travelling. I learned about the local culture, made friends, and learned a lot about myself in the process.<p>In a lot of ways tourism is a much easier route than immersing yourself in a culture. Being totally alone in a country where you can&#x27;t speak the language is pretty soul expanding.<p>I&#x27;ve only managed one (big) trip since then (with my now wife) through Central America. We stayed with a family in Nicaragua for a couple of weeks at the start to learn Spanish. We loved it. The hosts are always amazing (we ended up doing it a few times during the trip). Also, it&#x27;s <i>really</i> cheap. I think we paid $100 / week for accommodation, food and school (for both of us).<p>So my main bit of advice would be, try to be a local, not a tourist. It&#x27;s scary, but incredibly rewarding.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=effh9W_xHSg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=effh9W_xHSg</a>",1430003909

9439856,comment,9434760,9434760,0,0,wellboy,,,"To me, WoW taught me a lot for startups, especially PvP, because arena games were simply intelligence vs. intelligence fights. I think there is no other game or competition where such a broad range of skills is required in such a short amount of time (team play, application of knowledge of your character, of all other characters and their skills, use of surroundings, application of knowledge of game mechanics, very fast reactions). That&#x27;s why it was so much fun chasing the gladiator title, pure application of skill (got it in S3). I&#x27;ve never seen something alike before, just startups I feel have the same kind of &quot;game type&quot;.<p>A bit of a shame that the vanilla feeling is gone, I think it would have been important to keep the game hard, so that powerful items are very, very hard to get. It seems like they wanted to make high end content accessible to everyone in order to grow the user base, but it seems like the opposite effect was reached.

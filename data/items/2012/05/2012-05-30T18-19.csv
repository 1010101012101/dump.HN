The most profitable of tech businesses invariably have little to do with displaying ads. See examples Google (ad brokering), Amazon (selling shit to people), eBay (selling shit to people), LinkedIn (selling subscriptions to people), Apple (selling shit to people), AirBnb (selling rooms to people), DropBox (selling storage to people).<p>Holy shit, I'm starting to see a pattern here.

4044267,comment,4042931,4043314,3,0,temphn,,,"> even if you think the top employees are doing the work of 2 people each, or even 3 people (which is a lot to expect of anyone)<p>Claim: in software or engineering, your top employees are doing the work of a thousand people, or an infinite ratio of some of their fellow employees. No combination of administrative assistants at Google is going to program Google Chrome or even a sorting algorithm. No combination of HR people is capable of calculating structural loads.<p>Claim: (more arguable on Hacker News). Successfully managing a medium or large organization is likewise a skill shared by very few people. Managing humans is like programming on the most testy and finicky AWS nodes you could ever imagine. They don't do what they're told, they do other things, and they may return wrong results. You are responsible for making sure the group performs as a whole. This is engineering of a different sort.<p>There is a fundamental impedance mismatch between the amount of dollars required to sustain life (outside of serious health issues, this does not greatly vary from person to person) and the dollar productivity of each individual.<p>Arguably every great tech organization (commercial or non-commercial) has a few people who are 1000, 10000, or 1 million times as productive as others. People like Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Jeff Dean, Urs Holzle, Guido van Rossum, or DHH. That is how they became great tech or engineering organizations.<p>The Bell Curve may describe the population distribution of intelligence (though ability on any given trait may be different). But as a manager or recruiter your duty is to select highly nonuniformly from the right tail of that curve. Your ability distribution should be as radically right skewed as possible, and should not really resemble a bell curve.<p>In short, ""equal bonuses for all"" -- with the same amount going to both the guy who didn't do much work and the guy who picked up after him -- is a great way to demotivate your best people. And this will cost you a lot more than 2-3 of your medium employees, it will cost you a guy who did 1000X their work, and perhaps it will cost your whole business. All that matters are your best, with them you can rebuild anything.",1338404368

The difference is that traditional data flow is UserControlledCode (i.e. client-side JS) --> MyServer --> DataStore, whereas this is UserControlledCode --> DataStore. In practice you may often choose not to have the code in MyServer do anything beyond act as a pass-through, but not having that option at all seems scary. The only recourse I see is things like database schema constraints (e.g. max posts per user = 10), but that doesn't really solve the problem.<p>Edit: And I should add that the problem isn't just a user creating new many objects. The problem is that without code controlled exclusively by me somewhere in the middle, business logic (i.e. anything not codified in your database schema) becomes unenforceable. E.g. pull up firebug and type player.levelUp(); player.save();. Now there may be some subset of applications where business logic like this is completely unnecessary, but I can't think of many.",1338404054

""Teaching"" entrepreneurship is really teaching innovation and thinking divergently. Listing  problems, figuring out solutions, finding users, selling, and yada yada yada. The important thing is to start something. A close second is to fail... A lot.<p>As a teacher you should focus on developing the innovator as opposed to the innovation. This happens by building self confidence in a person, something I will iterate over and over is paramount in innovation: taking risks, learning from failure, seeing opportunity in difficulty. These are the traits to have. It starts by having your 6 students start something. Right now.<p>I'll recommend two resources I've personally used. One is the Founders Journey class at MIT taught by Ken Zolot. I TAed this class after taking it. In a nutshell: bringing in guest speakers to talk about their experience in the context if a theme (raising rounds, pivoting, etc).
<a href=""http://founders.mit.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://founders.mit.edu</a><p>The other resource is Start Labs, a non profit I cofounded over a year ago to ""develop the next generation of technical entrepreneurs."" We had hack nights, hackathons, pitch nights, career fairs and the ""bread and butter"": a 4 week accelerator called Concept to Company which took 7 teams with ideas, gave them space, a small bit of money, mentor ship, and the networks of the SF, NYC, and Boston ecosystem. It was definitely a structured program because unlike YC or TechStars we wanted to develop the people and that was our focus. We built a lot of curriculum for MIT and expanding leisurely over to Harvard as well. In any case great program tackling exactly your question. 
<a href=""http://startlabs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startlabs.org/</a><p>To close, teaching entrepreneurship really is about taking down the curtain of this world by having experienced guest speakers and a culture supporting you as well as starting something. Just do it! Fail often, fail fast. Out failure rises new ideas, thoughts, and opportunities. Finally, through building and doing, you become more confident in yourself - a necessity...

Math, when it comes to writing proofs and peer review, should absolutely be optimized for other experts. Whatever makes communicating ideas precisely among themselves is what's important here. I don't see the benefit of changing this process so those of us as outsiders can take a peek.<p>But as you said, there is a very large part of math that deals with applying these concepts and communicating them to non-mathematicians. The way we go about this is definitely in need of a do-over. Finding more intuitive ways to communicate these ideas is critical a critical part of this (possibly including more descriptive variable names). But, I think there will always be an inherent chasm between the math experts and those who are using the results they discover. An example is the difference between the calculus track of courses that every science major takes, and say, abstract algebra. The math that mathematicians do and the math that the rest of us learn will always be vastly different. It's just the nature of the beast.",1338403014
4044140,comment,4042719,4043897,3,0,the_bear,,,"Sure. My company is called ""Less Annoying CRM"" and one of our main marketing techniques is to identify all the things that annoy people about existing CRMs, and then do something that's not as annoying. Pricing is one of the huge things customers find annoying with business software right now. This is all anecdotal, but here are some things my customers have told me they hate about the pricing practices of other CRM companies:<p>-Requiring a credit card up front (assuming there's a free trial). Everyone is worried that they won't be able to cancel once they've signed up.<p>-Listing prices by month, but charging annually, or requiring an annual contract. It's easy to think that an extra hundred dollars up-front isn't a big deal, but it really is for many small businesses. You'd be shocked at how many companies struggle to afford their monthly software licenses.<p>-Limited free trials. Many people I talk to are shocked when they find out that the free trial works just like the paid version. I didn't realize that some companies offered limited free trials, but apparently they do, and customers hate it.<p>-Forcing customers to choose how many seats they want in advance, rather than just billing based on how many users there are in a given month. This makes it look like you're hoping a customer will pay for seats they never use, and the customer instantly stops trusting you.<p>-Having tiered pricing plans, particularly if more than one thing can trigger the next tier. For example, if you look at the Highrise pricing page (<a href=""http://highrisehq.com/signup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highrisehq.com/signup</a>) some companies might only have two users, but they might need 20 deals. Or they might have one user and one deal, but more than 5,000 contacts. Tiered plans can make it very difficult to figure out how much you'll actually pay, and it forces the users to constantly be paranoid that they might accidentally trigger the next level without knowing it.<p>This obviously depends a lot on your specific business, but here's the approach that I like best based on my experience: First, figure out what type of activity has the highest correlation with value added for the client. For example, we decided that each additional user on the system is the most important dimension on which to bill, but a project management product might pick # of projects. Then offer a la carte pricing based on only that one dimension, and make everything else unlimited.<p>For my company, this means we charge $10/month/user, and everything else is unlimited. You can put some caps in place under the terms of service to prevent people from abusing your unlimited policy, but make them high enough that they won't impact any of your non-abusive users.<p>You wouldn't believe how much it helps to have a simple pricing policy. How much does it cost? $10/user/month. What if I have a lot of contacts? $10/user/month. What if I need access to the API? $10/user/month. What if I need mobile access? $10/user/month. This approach removes a major stress point from the lives of the users because they no longer have to worry about trigger the next billing tier based on normal, everyday usage. It also makes your life easier because you when customers try to negotiate the price with you, you can make it clear that every single customer pays the exact same price no matter what.<p>I've had customers on the phone tell me that they love me because of this pricing model. Seriously. As I mentioned, this is all anecdotal, and I don't have any hard numbers to back up the efficacy, but it seems like common sense, and my customers validate the approach every day.",1338403001

4044096,comment,4042741,4042741,8,0,cdibona,,,"There are so many variables that go into valuing an offer from a startup that any general article like this can not ring true. Here's some questions I'd ask myself if I were considering an offer from a startup.<p>(wow, this is a lot longer than I expected it to be)<p>1) Who are the investors?<p>Before I joined VA Linux in 1998, I knew they were super close to closing the Intel Capital deal, so I knew (to a certain degree of accuracy) that they were close to having money in the bank. I agreed to take less salary for equity and a promise from the CEO that salary would improve as the company got more solid funding. The CEO was good to his word, too. I might have taken the job without the vc funding, but knowing what was up there was really helpful.<p>There is more knowledge now about the equity picture of a private technology company today than ever before in history. It's very easy to get an idea of a companies valuations and then if you agree with those values and if you think they'll increase.<p>Some VCs also have a reputation for screwing early employees and pancaking out those that might leave before an exit. This is very important to know if you're going to be valuing a potential equity stake. So, your equity could disappear without any regard for your feelings on the matter.<p>2) How far along are they towards going public/another exit.<p>I joined Google the week before it went public (in 2004), meaning my initial strike was the ipo opening price. Considering that made Google more stable than competing offers from younger startups, and more fun than some of the other companies I had offers from. The former was important as I had just come out of a failed startup and some time consulting, and I wanted stable more than I wanted fun. I got both, but that's pretty rare in companies of Google's vintage (I still have it, which is one of the reasons why I stay).<p>The point of this is to understand what the future of a company looks like. I knew what Google looked like, and for other companies when considering/working with them, I asked myself what do similar 'exits' look like. That leads to understanding of what an equity position means.<p>You can look at an offer and ask yourself: Will the company actually increase in value before an exit that makes this equity worth it?<p>3) Is there an established bonus system?<p>A lot of companies have no bonus and weaker benefits/salaries pre-ipo. They have the equity stake offer and so these other considerations are sidelined until they become larger and those equity offers stop attracting good people by themselves. These differences can mean 70 to 80k less per year for a senior employee. So, know what you're worth and decide if it is worth the risk.<p>4) Are the people running the company any good? Are they ethical?<p>This is actually hard to answer, but I've seen plenty of acquisitions become less lucrative than a similar job in an established company. I won't mention the company, but I've seen large companies (not Google that I know of) end up giving less in financial terms to acquired employess than they give a new hire wrt equity participation. It's kind of sad how little people know about the companies they join.<p>I'll say it again: I often see companies on HN get acquired, but for many of the employees, and not a few founders , of startups, this is a much worse deal financially than taking a job with an established firm. Your mileage may vary, and take it with a grain of salt, but remember you are trading money now for the chance of much more money later.<p>There's so much more I'd like to tell people here about considering offers, but I've already blathered on a bit much on this. I also readily admit I have a different approach to risk as a husband and father (2004) than I did as a single developer (1998)...",1338402482

That&#x27;s an unbelievably high number that&#x27;s caused directly by stupid, unprepared people stranding themselves. Closing the trail was definitely the right decision there.

9188554,comment,9185367,9185367,0,0,dqdo,,,"I would say that the main job of any CEO or top executive is to continuously learn and self improve. As a CEO, your job is to think strategically and with a long-term vision. Most of the daily problems should be delegated to the functional managers as you will be buried in work if you try to do everything yourself. Only in situations when the rest of the company cannot figure out themselves or when there is a lot at stake should the CEO intervene. I believe that a sign of a good leader is someone who is able to delegate work to others and trusts that they can get it done.<p>Given how fast we are moving in the world in terms of technology and business, there are new break throughs and developments everyday that can change the landscape of entire industries. As a CEO, your main role is to understand this landscape and have a vision for the next 2 to 5 years in the case of technology companies. For older and less turbulent industries this could be 5 to 10 years.<p>Keep in mind that what I am saying applies to companies with +100 employees. For early stage start-ups, the CEO will have to wear multiple hats and have to take a hands-on role otherwise the company will not have enough revenues to survive. Once you have pass the threshold of survival (~100 employees), you need to reorganize your company for growth. This is a difficult transition for most start-up CEOs and the dirty little secret that VCs keep from founders is that few founder CEOs make it through this transition.<p>One of the best way to ensure growth in your organization is to learn about the ever changing world outside of it so that you can help the rest of the organization continuously grow and thrive. One way of doing this is to look beyond your own industry and explore how other industries are dealing with their problems. Different industries are more advanced in different area so use this to your advantage. You can &quot;steal&quot; the best ideas and use them to improve internal operations. Remember that at this stage in your company, you are not really building anything new. Instead you job (which is just as difficult) is to improve on whatever already exists.<p>One reason why you should use your spare time to learn is that some companies actually march towards a wall because they are too busy pursuing immediate profits. This is the argument behind Clayten Christensen&#x27;s book the Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma. It is a great book and I would highly recommend it to all CEOs whether in start-ups or in large organizations.",1426121663

In a year, we&#x27;ll have modules, JIT caching/AOT (possibly) and runtime control over JIT optimizations[1]. Work is already underway for atomic value types, classdynamic, a new FFI layer, and a next-gen, fully programmable JIT (Graal). Many of those enhancements are not only ahead of other production quality offerings, but truly state of the art if not groundbreaking. Even when I look hard I can&#x27;t find another runtime that&#x27;s less than 5+ years behind (and that&#x27;s being generous).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/165"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/165</a>",1426121576

But what makes your boss happy today is a much more important concern in your decision making.<p>And secondly I think I get to see much worse startups and enterprises than Mr Blank.<p>Most of my day today was re-writing some project mgmt automation to save me from nagging.  It&#x27;s similar code I have written in small startups and large organisations - everyone seems to think project mgmt is a Good Thing despite all evidence.  Everyone will, if asked, say I should have spent the time today on those important innovations.  But they all want their bug trackers filled out correctly each morning, but analyse the projects every few weeks or months.<p>The feedback loop needs a tight time cycle for it to have a good effect on human beings.<p>Even in startups, the time horizon for death of company has been months away.  I rarely have come across projects in large or small companies that have a deadline more than a year out and usually six months.  Most startups can plan on a runway that long.<p>I think it is something else, a dedication to engineering quality perhaps, to open and transparent discussion, but somehow innovation happens in both startups and large companies.  It&#x27;s just in large companies it&#x27;s harder to find amount at all the rest.<p>All of which suggests one other consideration - the people lamenting the golden age of startups are suffering from a survivorship bias - the startup that grew was successful (else they could not pay Steve blank) but that means it was unusual.  It is possible that most startups are also lacking in innovation, it&#x27;s just the people who can lament this to Mr Blank do not see those startups in action and so think the incidence of innovative culture is more prevalent globally than it really is.<p>Edit: tidy up a bit",1426120420

9188373,comment,9185853,9185853,0,0,cakoose,,,"The author spends a lot of effort trying to make his functions point-free.  For example, the author first writes:<p><pre><code>    inexactMatches xs ys = matches xs ys - exactMatches xs ys
</code></pre>
then decides it&#x27;s not very &quot;nice&quot;, and ends up with this:<p><pre><code>    inexactMatches = pure2 (-) <**> matches <**> exactMatches
</code></pre>
I can sympathize with this preference.  When I first started learning Haskell, figuring out how to make something point-free was extremely satisfying.  And it also increases DRY, which is generally a good thing.<p>But over time I realized I was overusing point-free style.  It was fun to write, but harder to read.  If I were actually writing &quot;inexactMatches&quot; for something real, I would strongly prefer the first over the second.  From what I&#x27;ve read, I think many people take a similar path when learning Haskell.<p>That said, I think everyone has a different threshold.  For example, I&#x27;ve heard many people say that a for loop is more clear than something like &quot;map&quot; or &quot;fold&quot;.  I would disagree with that, but maybe that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve gotten used to &quot;map&quot; and &quot;fold&quot;.<p>So maybe the author&#x27;s brain is just able to handle point-free style better than mine can, but I do think this particular example if far enough on the spectrum that most Haskell programmers would prefer the first version (for real code).<p>So if you&#x27;re considering learning Haskell, don&#x27;t be scared away.

So, absolutely, the new executive should be facilitating solutions well before 90 days.<p>As I recall, in my first 90 days:<p>1. On day one several people hinted to me about work from an under performing contractor. On day 2, I met with this contractor and looked at his code. On day 3 I put him on a performance improvement plan. On day 8 I decided that he was the wrong fit for the role and ended his contract. Great guy, but he was just hired for one thing and then asked to do something else. But there wasn&#x27;t anyone else who was really qualified to track down whether the problem was direction or fit.<p>2. There was a general consensus that we weren&#x27;t shipping code fast enough. On week 3 we implemented Scrum (it was 2005). The engineers kind of hated it. But Scrum achieved what was needed. The rest of the company had enough visibility into development speed to realize that the problem with the company was bad product/market fit, not bad developers. We pivoted a bunch of times. Twitter was one of those pivots.<p>3. We were running our own servers in a cage at 360 Main. Those servers had been setup originally by one of the founders. There was definitely a desktop computer in there serving production code. The servers were administered by various engineers on the team (administered poorly because it&#x27;s not what they wanted to be doing). So I started recruiting for a sysadmin. I definitely had hired him within the first 60 days.<p>There were plenty of things in there that I tried to fix as well and failed at.

We reused the parts that serialize data for the API and put the resulting documents in RethinkDB.

We built this for our most problematic endpoint and got the two-server cluster up and running in about a week, tried it out on employees for another week, and then enabled it for everyone (with the option to quickly fall back to pulling data from MySQL).<p>This turned out to work well and we saw good response times, so we did the same thing for other endpoints.<p>There&#x27;s some complexity involved in keeping RethinkDB docs up to date with MySQL (where writes still go) but nothing extreme and we haven&#x27;t had many sync issues.<p>RethinkDB has been rock solid and it&#x27;s a joy to operate.",1426119035

In the beginning, we would still have people that were used to working..and they would be able to support everyone.  But, as more and more people were born into the system (and used to the free money), there would be less and less money to pull from as a whole..and either the system would collapse completely or the government would pretty much have to take over private industry.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a good idea; it should be tested first, and, if it fails, we throw it out (unlike so many &quot;big&quot; ideas where, if and when it fails, the reason is always that &quot;we didn&#x27;t do it big enough, so we have to throw more at it&quot;). The success criteria need to be well defined, but not politically motivated like so many ideas for providing for the poor. Like I said, I don&#x27;t know how to get there from here.&quot;<p>Government programs don&#x27;t really work this way.  I don&#x27;t think we could just &quot;try it out&quot; without wasting lots of taxpayer dollars.<p>&quot;Is it better to move towards a new economic model that accounts for it or just deal with the revolution when 75% of people are unemployed?&quot;<p>Again, you keep making these outlandish claims.  How can I take you seriously?<p>JIT manufacturing isn&#x27;t even close to taking out 75% of the jobs and it might not be close in our lifetimes. We might as  well be discussing the potential of quantum teleportation technology putting the automotive industry out of business.<p>&quot;No, the single worst thing you can do is let them starve or freeze to death, because then their one and only life is over.&quot;<p>Our poor are better than most countries in the world.  Want to see real poverty?  Go to India, Vietnam, Cambodia, or many countries in Africa.<p>&quot;I consider this argument the &quot;the poor are only poor because they are lazy, so anything that makes them more lazy will only make them worse&quot; argument. And I believe it is a lazy argument in itself.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not laziness, it&#x27;s just human nature.  Any system needs to take into account human nature or it won&#x27;t last..with painful results.<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve scrounged through cupboards hoping there was anything in them while my parents drank away whatever money they got.&quot;<p>With freedom comes the freedom to destroy you or your kids lives.

He finally got a job last year and makes 6 figures.  We all thought that this would be a life-changing event.  The result?  He declared bankruptcy this year and can barely afford his mortgage.<p>Education is the key.  Throwing more money at the problem without some sort of education won&#x27;t solve the issue.<p>&quot;Should I have been told to piss off because my parents couldn&#x27;t pay for me to go to college? I had a high school diploma, so I had &quot;enough&quot;, right?&quot;<p>No, but if the tax payer does pay for your school (and you don&#x27;t need to pay it back), you should be required to pick a major that has some chance of actually making you enough money to pay for the major.<p>&quot;Where do you draw the line? How do you determine who is good enough and who isn&#x27;t?&quot;<p>We have many systems that already help the disadvantaged, but it never seems to be good enough.  My taxes right now are close to 50% of my pay check, but it&#x27;s never enough.<p>With great freedom comes great responsibility.  If you are going to blame parenting and the way you are brought up on the inability to find a good job and succeed in life, maybe we should have less freedoms in regards to how a child is raised?<p>It just seems silly to not want to put any responsibility on the person having the children or the person that is poor yet continue to demand more and more money from society when it obviously isn&#x27;t working.<p>On top of all this, we now have lots of free information available to us online.  There are entire college courses, video tutorials, blogs, and other forms of free education available to all.  You can even go to pretty much any library in any city and get high-speed Internet for free (many homeless people go to the public libraries in my city).  Yet, we still have a problem with a lack of education and many people not able to get jobs.<p>I also don&#x27;t like this notion that because a person is poor..that must be the reason why they aren&#x27;t succeeding.  We need to put more responsibility on the individual if you really want anything to change.  Your place in life many times has to do with your poor decision making and planning.",1426118674

It looks like you're off to a great start.<p>I live in a fairly unique climate in the US (maritime, like England), and as a gardener, I'd say your planting picks are reasonable for my area.<p>A few general thoughts:<p>People have said it here already, but container gardening+++. It's how a lot of people get started gardening, and therefore is a compelling product for your market niche, inexperienced gardeners. Pick a great product and sell it, I think the 'insta-garden' pitch is likely to be a big seller for you.<p>I would personally recommend you resell earthboxes, they're fabulous and have good online marketing if people care to learn about them. Partner up with local organic soil and fertiliser providers, and get them to do the shipping for you if you're worried about logistics. Earthbox might cross promote you if you got in touch, your site is cute and cool.<p>Second, I think you should find a better source for gardening advice than google lucky searches. There are a lot of possibilities here, and eventually crowdsourcing _local_ tips would be awesome -- as you know, gardening is always a really local activity -- but you might just hire a well-'spoken' vegetable gardener to write up instructions, or look for a gardening book writer who wants to cross promote on your site.<p>That is all, and good luck!<p>Also, your site is overloaded and Heroku is complaining sometimes.

How about, instead, we degrade gracefully if the visitor is using IE6?<p>If a visitor using IE6 views my site and they see boxy divs versus others who see rounded corners, does it take away anything from the IE6 visitor? They're still seeing the content (which, hopefully, is the main purpose of their visit!)<p>Obviously, this isn't a solution for everyone (and seriously, wishful thinking, hah!)<p>So for my <i>actual</i> response: You're absolutely right. I'm not arguing we start implementing a CSS3 solution along with a JS solution today. This demo (along with other css3 articles) isn't about today. It's about tomorrow and the future of the web.<p>However, if we keep catering to older browsers, what's their incentive to upgrade?? Sure, we could throw a JS hack together to get all browsers to function the same, but why? (sorry, wishful thinking again!)<p>I do commend you on degrading gracefully. Many developers simply don't.

I could create or work for a hugely successful company. I could make a killing in real estate. I could win second place in a beauty contest. Lots of different things.<p>I try my best not to be materialistic, but there are times when I see beautiful homes or fancy cars or $650 Prada shoes and I think ""I could so totally enjoy that someday"". There's at least a little bit of hope that I could, someday.<p>There are lots of people out there who, without the ability to buy lottery tickets, would feel they have no possible way to become fabulously wealthy (even if that feeling isn't strictly correct). For these people, there's no sense of hope for breaking out of where they are, and the absence of hope is very painful. Spending a few dollars a week on lottery tickets to keep that hope alive becomes a sort of rational purchase.  People aren't actuarial robots.<p>I'm not saying that I think that buying lottery tickets are a good idea, or that government-run lotteries aren't a form of abusive regressive taxation, but the conclusion of the linked article that people are still poor because they keep on buying lottery tickets is naive and condescending.",1273593294

If hedge funds and quants are going to put semi-autonomous trading programs into the market, they need to have accountability for their actions.  Eliminating the consequences for this kind of out-of-control trading creates moral hazard, in the same way as bailing out housing speculators who now can't pay their mortgage.

However, new companies are much more free to build on whatever technology stack is most appropriate.<p>I've also noticed over time that lots of non-CS majors can and do program in scripting languages because they are relatively easy to pick up and get things done with.

If they happen to learn Perl and PHP first, then that is what they stick with.<p>These people may like to program, but it is not the favorite part of their job and they have other work activities they enjoy more. More importantly, they know little to nothing about software design principles and are not interested in improving their software development skills. They would rather spend their time learning about something else that interests them more. Therefore, they don't even know how to appreciate the advantages more modern scripting languages offer. To these people, languages like Perl are more than sufficient to get their job done, and they are probably right.<p>However, as people who know better, I believe we should be encouraging better languages in a friendly way whenever possible.

Based on the provider of the original list the query is turned into an actual implementation of your LINQ query.

When I delivered my  | ECOOP keynote in 2004, I made the PITCH point slightly differently using the  | Design Patterns book. I developed some code using the patterns from the book in Java. I requested and received confirmation that the code was truly OO oriented and truly according to Their Book. Then I tested it and it worked fine. Then I stress-tested it (on a not so large input), and it failed with stack overflow.<p>>> The next step was to demo the same code in the  | PLT Scheme class system, which looked very similar to the Java code. And it ran great on those stress tests and even larger ones. So I asked the 300-400 people in the audience what the problem was and why this slow, interpreted language Scheme did it right and Java, C#, Eiffel, Python, etc got it wrong.<p>>> Not one person had any insight so after a minute of playing with them, I told them about the story of ""Smalltalk to Actors to Scheme and how PITCH had 'come along for the ride'"" (you may recall our email exchange in the spring of 2004 to confirm the story of 'apply'). And I did reinforce how much knowledge the OO research community has forgotten over the years.<p>>> Sadly, the reaction was surprisingly hostile from some corners in the room. One person was especially outspoken in arguing that we all know that we just need three or four special constructs -- and they may have to be map or for-each or such -- and we'd be in business. Given that it was a public exchange, it was difficult to point out to him how messed up his argument was.<p>>> While I have received many positive emails about the talk (my slides are on-line and people find them time and again), this message about PITCH deserves to be repeated and repeated and repeated for OO audiences.

It's just another Turing-Complete language, right?<p>Perl was one of the first popular scripting languages out there to have well-integrated regex handling <i>and</i> was useful for programming purposes.  Most old-school systems and network people not only know how to code their way out of a paper bag, but typically grew up with C and Perl as their two go-to languages.  C when you needed speed above all else, and Perl when you needed the regex functionality.<p>While specific functions vary for any given environment, I can safely say that I've written all of these in Perl at one point or another:<p>- Crunching netflow data to make life easier for those who do capacity planning.<p>- Running glue scripts against a device database to generate the configs that go to open-source monitoring systems.<p>- Lexing SNMP data in order to generate a device-independent network configuration, and then turning around and ""compiling"" it to another target network device.<p>All of these could be re-written in python.  I've done it. Yet, they're all written in Perl because that's what the people who ""Run The Internet"" historically have used.<p>In another generation, maybe Python will be the regex-heavy scripting language of choice.   For right now though, I suppose the best answer is that that Perl holds the Internet together for historical reasons, because that's what got the job done.",1273590438

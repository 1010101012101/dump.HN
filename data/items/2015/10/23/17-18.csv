Rosea is an execution architecture intended as the target for translating XUML models using Tcl as the implementation language. The package consists of a run time execution library that implements the XUML semantics and a domain specific configuration language that is used to specify the XUML domain model and generate the required data for the run time execution. Rosea uses TclRAL as the basis of its data architecture and that enables referential integrity constraint checking based on the XUML class diagram relationships and supports set-at-a-time operations on domain class instances. Processing is transactional and constraint violations result in rolling back the changes to a known good state.&quot;",1445622932

My car is from 2001, has side curtain airbags which will render most common crashes non-fatal, and it still has a fully mechanical throttle and no electronic brake controller of any kind. I don&#x27;t consider it all that old.<p>Yes it has an ECU, but EFI is not the problem in my opinion, and the computer by itself doesn&#x27;t frighten me. EFI was a fantastic invention as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Also despite it being a &quot;black box&quot; I find it much more pleasurable to tune and maintain EFI systems over fickle carburetors.<p>The real problem was making the ECU an _active control system_ which directly controls the engine, throttle, brakes, etc. in response to your inputs; as opposed to a passive one which merely _reacts in response to changes in its environment_ (e.g: more air moving through the intake, wheels locked up, losing traction on one side.)<p>So yes, my &#x27;01 Toyota has a black box, but it&#x27;s simple enough that it could be replaced by a handful of aftermarket controllers, many of which have their source freely available, or available for a modest licensing fee.<p>---<p>Also I&#x27;d like to disagree that reacting to WOT is a &quot;complex decision matrix.&quot; -- My instinctual reaction would be as follows.<p>First you open the clutch and/or put the car in neutral. Disconnecting the motor from the wheels is the most reasonable solution to this problem. When I was taught to drive stick the very first thing I was told, before I ever moved the car an inch, was: &quot;when you need to stop, clutch and brake.&quot;<p>(Of course if it&#x27;s an automatic transmission: &quot;going into neutral&quot; is just controlled by another black box. Sucks to be you if you hit deadly bugs in two separate powertrain management controllers.)<p>(As an aside I do personally know people that commute every day in the US, and they don&#x27;t even know what a transmission <i>does.</i> Why are we licensing these people as skilled motorists?)<p>If I somehow found myself without even the most basic control of my transmission then you just press the brakes as hard as you can and you stop in ~300 feet.[1]<p>If that didn&#x27;t work, or if I had stopped but hadn&#x27;t regained control of the vehicle, I would then kill the ignition. (To be fair: I&#x27;m told this is not quite so simple in modern cars! Apparently someone thought &quot;pushing and holding a button for 3 seconds&quot; was a better idea than &quot;turn a key.&quot; -- However I also wouldn&#x27;t agree to drive a car if I didn&#x27;t know something as basic as how to kill the ignition under duress. I&#x27;m the sort of guy that reads the manual cover to cover for fun.)<p>If killing the ignition doesn&#x27;t work[2] and your transmission is somehow stuck engaged then today is really not your day.<p>I don&#x27;t see how any of this requires any more skill than driving does normally. To me this is not some complex decision tree, it&#x27;s reflex at this point.<p>(Also there is a good reason I would brake before killing the ignition. Brakes and steering are mechanically assisted by the engine. It would be extremely irresponsible to cut the ignition in a vehicle w/ power steering and power brakes on a public motorway in my opinion. -- Again I don&#x27;t think this is some complex decision, I believe it should be requisite knowledge for being licensed to operate a motor vehicle under such conditions.)<p>tl;dr: the complexity in this matrix is inherent in the task itself. If this is &quot;too complex&quot; then maybe we should work to improve our driver training and licensing programs; or better yet consider having more people take public transit, instead of handing out licenses like candy.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://media.caranddriver.com/images/media/51/braking-results-photo-319716-s-original.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.caranddriver.com/images/media/51/braking-result...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NRaqgab0_w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NRaqgab0_w</a>",1445622053

And I&#x27;m afraid to say that that doesn&#x27;t scale. It&#x27;s a lot of work by one human being, figuring out who covers what and how you can appeal to them.<p>That&#x27;s why PR agencies exist. One small group of people does the grueling work of tracking down and getting to know reporters.<p>Unfortunately, PR agencies have a principle-agent problem. Most of their clients have no way to figuring whether they&#x27;re doing their work well. They just know they&#x27;re paying $15K per month. And in fact, more than half of all PR agencies suck, including some of the most famous ones. So you need to watch out.<p>One of the reasons they suck is they send out form emails, like the kind Austen is advocating here. Personalized emails don&#x27;t really scale. Changing the names of the reporter and publication is not really personalization.<p>To be fair, Austen is right in saying you need a list of publications and reporters that may be interested in you, and you need to know where to situate those publications in a pyramid of importance. He&#x27;s also right about the trickle-up effect. You want to start off Broadway, and offer increasing social proof of your newsworthiness as you move up the ladder (which keep going past TC to larger general-readership publications if you&#x27;re lucky).<p>But if you send out a form email, you will piss off the people you want to please. They get 1000s of those per day, and they don&#x27;t even bother to delete. Deletion itself would be too much effort. You have to understand that with the evisceration of the press in this country, the ratio of newsmakers to reporters has increased. The reporters are overwhelmed. You need to offer them something special.<p>And you need to do that from the subject line of your email -- that&#x27;s your only chance to get any of them to spend an additional 5 seconds on your message.<p>And now I need to say something counterintuitive:<p>Your first message to a reporter shouldn&#x27;t be about you. It should be about them. People approach PR way to late in the game, when they have a launch they need coverage for.<p>If you&#x27;re smart, you&#x27;ll start much earlier, when you don&#x27;t need press, and you can simply offer someone help. Read their stories, figure out if you have information, insights or introductions you can make to help them do their job and look smart, and give them that.<p>It&#x27;s better to start out giving rather than taking.<p>I wrote this free ebook for a startup where I worked two years ago.

To use the main example from the article, Cat would crush Miller if Miller didn&#x27;t have access to this method of financing their lawsuit, and Miller&#x27;s lawsuit looks at least plausible, so them being crushed out of hand is a bad outcome. So, it does somewhat fix the problem of smaller litigants being able to go up against larger defendants without just being automatically crushed out of hand.<p>However, it does seem that there are some obvious failure states for this new system. If venture litigation becomes the norm, then only litigants who are either extremely large themselves or can attract financing will even have a chance of victory. So, the financiers become the de facto arbiters of the judicial system.<p>To me, the real problem is that the civil justice system is so expensive as to be out of reach for many/most people, or at least putting a limit on how big a size difference the two parties can have. All told, this isn&#x27;t that different than someone taking out a mortgage to fund a lawsuit, and that is fairly obviously allowed.

I also agree that without close to full employment (say long term >80% of people that want/need jobs) the basic economic and political paradigms we have no longer work.<p>I&#x27;m kind of agnostic whether or not we are headed there. Technology taking skill out of the equation like in Adam Smith&#x27;s famous pin example is somewhat similar to driverless cars. Generally technology has affected the demand for labour all throughout history, and it&#x27;s affected the demand for labour of all kinds. We used to need musicians to listen to music, bars & cinemas employed them. Is that brain power or manual labour? We used to need engineers to do calculations by hand. Demand for engineers stayed high because we just do more engineering.<p>Also, in my agnosticism, I think there&#x27;s a bunch of room for middle ground outcomes. Unemployment that stays around 30%, for example. That is also a political paradigm shift.<p>I don&#x27;t expect we&#x27;ll soon run out of demand or that people will not have an effect on our productive capacity.

But Kubernetes deals with a fundamentally more abstract set of primitives: groups of containers (pods), replicated pods, and automatically managed dispatch points to said groups called services.<p>The Marathon documentation literally recommends you hand-roll a periodically updated haproxy service to accomplish that last bit. While K8S introduces a fair amount of overhead to accomplish this feat reliably, that overhead pays off by having a very responsive and available system.<p>So yeah. K8s is working one level up the stack, as I see it. I think you can make something reasonable with only Marathon, and that thought is backed up by the reality of people doing it.

If you randomly generate a sufficiently large number, then break it up into smaller pieces (as the article suggests), and then apply some mapping algorithm that goes from those pieces to a poem, as long as every possible number would generate a distinct poem, you haven&#x27;t lost any of your randomness. More specifically, constraints like &quot;must rhyme&quot; don&#x27;t have to lose randomness, they just have to have an algorithm that can map every possible number to a distinct rhyming phrase, which can easily be done by adding words to the poem (e.g. if you have 300k possible words, don&#x27;t use an 18-bit number to generate each word, use a smaller bit size and map the number to a subset of the dictionary. Now you can control which subset each number maps to, and the only penalty is adding a word or two to the poem.<p>The only real constraint here is every single number must map to a viable poem, and every single poem that can be generated must represent one and only one number.

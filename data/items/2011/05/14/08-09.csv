(My day job is in health care for the last 20 years in 35 hospitals in 5 states.)  Health care's problems in poor countries are primarily due to a lack of hygine and clean water.  Most of the rest of their problems can be helped with decent tropical disease vaccine research.  Thats not an interest or willingness issue, thats a funding and economics issue.<p>There are massive amounts of funding for clean/green tech right now.  Those innovations are going to be hard, and come slowly, but we do have a lot of brilliant minds working on those problems.<p>I dare say I have a front seat at the innovation table by hosting the largest group of garage stage startups at Hackers & Founders Silicon Valley.  I see a lot of amazingly cool stuff months before it hits event the startup press.<p>Here's what I see:<p>Founders building social media startups are rare.  Precious few founders think about monetizing via ads, unless they are building a search engine.  Funding for ad based, or social media startups are hard to come by unless they show tons of traction before funding.<p>The coolest apps I'm seeing built are hardware peripherals to mobile phones or mobile devices:  An ultrasound probe attached to an iPhone that can serve as a fetal heart monitor.  Motion tracking devices that can be attached to your head and ankle so you can control a racing game on your iPad while excdcising on your bike.<p>Theres a ton of innovation happening around the food space, creating new markets for food producers and consumers.<p>There are also companies like Genomera.com, which is building a system for crowd sourced clinical trials.  Factual.com is building an open source model around big data.<p>BioCurious is a very cool hacker space/community around DIY bio thats getting organized.  As the costs of bio hacking come down, theres going to be a ton of innovation there.<p>Theres tons of innovation surrounding the Kinect.  I talked with the CEO of Health 2.0 a few weeks ago, and a Neurologist and a programmer got together at one of their hackathons, and in a weekend, built a pediatric gait abnormality monitor.  Wait until the official SDK comes out, and drivers are included in Windows 8, and youre going to see some really cool things.<p>The very fabric and character of Silicon Valley is changing because of innovation in how companies are funded (Angel List).  Hundreds, and soon thousands of two to four person startups are going to be funded.  I believe whats going to happen is because of that, the rate of innovation in Silicon Valley and around the globe is going to accelerate dramatically.<p>You complain that there's no innovation because everybody is just building gadgets.  Gadgets like cell phones are revolutionizing 3rd world economies, and mobile payments via cell phones are creating truly disruptive innovation like electronic banking and electronic money transfer.  I visited my brother doing economic development in Honduras, and most everyone carries a cell phone, even if they live in a house with a dirt floor.<p>Have you looked at the innovations that are happening in robotics?  My nephew is studying at a community college in rural Minnesota right now, and hes in a robotics competition.  Hes programming a robot that can crawl around and check to see if a seedling tree is dead or not.  If its dead, the robot pulls the seedling.  If not, it keeps driving.<p>Open your eyes.  Stop reading Tech Crunch.  Go to Maker Faire.  Awesome things are happening and you dont even realize it.<p>And, if you're sick of the lack of innovation... then create something.  Complaining about it online does nothing.",1305360634

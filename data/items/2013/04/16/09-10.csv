5557206,comment,5556688,5556688,4,0,jnardiello,,,"I work for a popular brand selling accessories on eBay and Amazon. One of my duties is replying to customer care inquiries. We are a small start-up, our team is small, therefore happens quite often to spend hours every day replying to customers having a number of problems (postage problem, usage problem, etc..).<p>I do totally understand the seller, they have done everything they could to make the buyer happy. The buyer, instead of giving a chance to the seller to make things right just left a bad feedback. I guess anybody can see how unfair this is.<p>Feedbacks and reviews are supposed to give a hint to potential buyers about the service or product they will get. The truth is that more than often they are a ""weapon"" for frustrated buyers to revenge and damange the seller, without being anyhow responsible for it. This is unfortunate becouse bad reviews and bad feedbacks damage sellers not only with their reputation but also kill sales. Having a bad review on Amazon means to simply not sell that very particular product, doesn't really matter if the bad experience was due to inexpertise of the buyer or from a delivery problem (all things that are completely out of the sellers control).<p>When you are a young company, it's hyper-frustrating to be damaged and see your sales killed or importantly reduced by a customer that was unhappy because of something you couldn't control in any possible way. While in such a situation the company must anyway step-up and take action to mitigate the problem (and they did as they offered a refund) the buyer must be responsible for actually damaging their business. It requires experience to understand that sometimes customers are just trolls spoilt by life and to just let it go. If you have a great company providing excellent products and services you'll make it up with future orders :)",1366106201

The corresponding private key was itself encrypted using ""[a] complex passphrase [that] is not stored electronically"". They could be lying, but if they are not then this is perfectly valid security.<p>Using this scheme, you can store new CC numbers any time you want using the public key. You'd have a regular billing cycle(say a month) with billings happening in a short time window(All my linode accounts get billed within minutes of each other so I think this is the case for linode). When you want to bill your customers you'd input the passphrase which wouldn't be stored anywhere, would be used to temporarily decrypt the CC numbers and bill everyone. Unless you are attacked in that window(or an attacker gains access before that window and can remain unnoticed until it happens, and even then they'd need root access to read the memory and not just access to the filesystem) then the CC numbers are pretty safe against any attack that leaks files/databases/etc...",1366105637

Obviously it managed to reach earth, which would mean it (the organism) had to travel through space for an extended period of time - the authors claim that it was frozen - so you should account for that time in the graph, and obviously life couldn't settle on earth for quite some time because in the beginning our planet was extremely hot and unsuitable for any kind of life. That would shift their postulated origin of life further into the past, most likely to a point where there wasn't even a universe to begin with, or at least no planets that would allow for the formation of life.

For example, I saw my mother beating my father all the time when I was growing up, yet I get a bunch of straight liberals yelling at me  if I mention supporting the establishment of domestic violence shelters for men about how they can't believe any ""legitimate"" GLBT person would support something  like that. I once had a person tell me that she couldn't believe any self respecting GLBT person would support them, since ""ANY study"" would show that men were predominantly the agressors. I linked her to 200 studies showing equal rates of male vs female aggressors, and she made a vague post about cleaning her friendslist based on ""politics"" and promptly removed me. I don't know how to deal with people who literally refuse to acknowledge that my entire childhood is something that could never exist. Or refuse to recognize that they're wrong, when science says something that happens to contradict their pre established worldview.<p>It's incredibly bewildering, and more than a little cruel. I have to deal with the memories and trauma of my childhood, on top of conservatives AND liberals being unwilling to associate with me because of my views.

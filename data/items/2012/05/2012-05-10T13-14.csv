I've never used Quark, but the picture painted by others looks similar.<p>The thing that puzzles me is <i>why</i> no-one has yet come up with a credible competitor to CS (or, similarly, to MS Office). Two of the most successful software companies on the planet make a very significant chunk of their profits on these product lines, and they are certainly open to disruption by competition based on usability and/or quality/reliability as well as functionality and workflow.

Without @classmethod, we'd have to write a custom metaclass (and instruct our class to use that) if we wanted even a single class method on a class. Multiple inheritance would break (or at least be difficult to reason about) when classes defined class methods, because there would have to be both an instance method resolution order and a class MRO. Fortunately Python's built-in `type` provides the descriptor protocol, which allows us to have class methods and instance methods and properties and all these other nice things without having to metaprogram or hack the interpreter.<p>All I'm asking for is a similar (if less ornate) interface for Django models, wherein the methods that operate on collections of things can be defined alongside the methods that operate on individual things, without requiring a knowledge of Manager/QuerySet internals.",1336658332

Microsoft sees that Apple has done it, and now they have a valid position to do it as well. Look at all the things Microsoft did in the 90s when they were dominant. They got sued for anti-trust and lost, and paid a dear price for it. Apple was not a monopoly in any market at that time, so they took a page out of Microsoft's book knowing they would not be sued over it. Apple could create vendor-lock-in, they could bundle whatever software they wanted, they could only allow their software on their hardware and anyone who tries to go outside that could be sued into bankruptcy. All perfectly legal since Apple wasn't a monopoly, and this helped them gain marketshare quickly.<p>Warning: speculative prediction follows.<p>Now that Apple is the monopoly in the mobile world, <i>they</i> are the ones who have to answer to anti-competitive practices. Microsoft is what Apple was in the 90s. Microsoft right now is where Apple was in 2001; making a clean break from the days of old, using the same tricks the dominant player is under legal investigation for. If history repeats itself, Apple will be pinned for the same things Microsoft was, and Microsoft will be able to leverage that for a fair bit of marketshare.<p>End speculation.<p>Whether or not the above comes to play, Microsoft wouldn't be pushing Windows 8 and WoA if Apple hadn't laid down the red carpet for this kind of behavior. Microsoft's internal position is likely more along the lines of ""lockdowns are fair game again!""",1336658049

Can't believe we didn't collaborate on this, we'd happily be your first customer :(<p>A few interesting differences:<p>- Our approach is more like Meteor - web only, no iOS support<p>- The backend is a python tornado app that handles validation and conflict resolution before saving stuff to dynamodb<p>- We have a JS datastore backed by websql/indexeddb/memory that syncs with our backend datastore<p>- We have ""live"" Backbone collections that update themselves when datastore queries return different results<p>- We have a Backbone sync adapter that uses the datastore to persist data locally and kick off synchronization<p>- We sync a subset of the data (eg 3 months of mail) - thats a core requirement for us<p>- We sync all of the tables at once, not per bucket, cause queries are joining tables so the 
datastore has to be consistent at all times<p>- No operational transforms cause it doesn't seem to apply to us - pretty ""notepad"" specific I think<p>- No versioning as we didn't see benefits for us<p>- We'll probably open source this stuff when we're done<p>What do you use for storage?",1336657542
3953417,comment,3952751,3953371,15,0,jonnathanson,,,"This is well said (and, perhaps, a similar story could be told about Steve Jobs). But I think there's at least one point in the article that holds true: it's very tough to evaluate the credibility of a ""business"" co-founder until he's achieved success. A developer's talent can be measured and normalized; a business person -- before he becomes successful -- is a much riskier and more unknowable commodity.<p>One way to look at things is to say that great businesspeople are undervalued. Another viewpoint is that the valuation of businesspeople carries with it a much higher risk multiplier. Or that the valuation has far fewer knowable variables.<p>The article makes a variety of very unfair, broad, and naive generalizations about the role of a great business, marketing, or product person. It seems to conflate all business people into one bucket -- lumping the fly-by-night hucksters and phonies in with the true visionaries. And its point about how a business founder is 'only as good as his contact list' is a bit ridiculous. But unfortunately, that contact list is often the business person's best calling card. It's one of very few, knowable variables that he brings to the table. (A track record on paper is great, but can be unreliable, because anyone can spin a resume. Conversely, a list of impressive people who can vouch for someone, or even go to bat for him, is much more actionable).",1336657533

There was a high level executive at a large enterprise software firm. The guy was one of the best enterprise sales people in North America and highly valued by the organization. In reading about the trend of software moving online he realized that the industry he was in, selling large scale enterprise solutions to Fortune 500 companies, was eventually going to be replaced by software delivered online.<p>He attempted to get his organization to shift into investing in online web services, but they saw it as a threat to their traditional business model. He quit work and then went to find technical people who could implement the visitation. He ended up recruiting a group of 8-10 developers, all sold on the vision. He wrote up a quick vision for the company and raised a few million dollars on the back of it.<p>He leased out cheap and nasty office space down in the suburbs outside of San Jose. He spent two weeks writing a software specification for a new enterprise product that would be entirely web based. The spec was a couple of dozen pages long. He also wrote a marketing brief on how the product would be sold. He handed the spec over to the developers and then went on vacation in Hawaii for a few months while they built the initial version of the product.<p>A few months later and with a first version he went out to the media and announced 'the end of software' and introduced a new web services model for the enterprise: salesforce.com. Over 10 years later and the company has a $20 billion market cap, defined an entirely new industry and threatened the business of his old employer (Oracle) to the extend that they setup a clone competitor.<p>If the original developers who joined Marc Benioff had read this blog post, they would have questioned 'his contribution', especially the part where he took off on holiday. Product and business people are entirely undervalued. Benioff could have found the eight developers he required from any thousands of other developers to implement what he had in mind, but there was only one person who had the vision, perseverance and balls to do what he did.",1336657045

It applies even more strongly for more complex lookups (possibly involving Q objects), which I've always felt would find a better home in models.py than in views.py. And I too cringe every time I come across the django.db.models.manager source code.<p>Some thoughts:<p>The approach goes slightly against the commandment of ""there should just be one way of doing it"". It's probably best to apply it sparingly, only where there are very clear readability and/or DRYness improvements to be had.<p>The `PassThroughManager.for_queryset_class(TodoQuerySet)()` bit is a bit intimidating, especially to someone not familiar with django-model-utils. I'd probably take the time to write a `manager_with_queryset(queryset, manager=models.Manager)` function to make things more readable.<p>When you're trying to convince someone that the way they currently code isn't optimal, it really helps if the code you use to illustrate the current way looks like something your reader is likely to write. The strangely formatted filter chain at the start is thus really off-putting. Instead of adding three disclaimers asking the reader not to focus on the implementation details, why not just write it the way most people would:<p><pre><code>    todos = Todo.objects.filter(
        owner=request.user,
        is_done=False,
        priority=1,
    )

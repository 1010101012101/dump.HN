From there I would either go to bed or brute force the next few hours, despite being aware of the time in general. Now, I don't get that feeling until much later either at 22hrs when the sun has come up and F.lux begins fading out, or a little later if I'm not paying attention until after the sun has come up and the screen's been blue for a while. (At that point, I either notice the sun through the trees or get a splitting headache).<p>To further describe where I work: shaded area, floor to ceiling books, no clock, no phones. I do graphic work during the day and by early evening I'm in the command line until whenever. I can usually get out during the day, but sometimes I just don't.

It takes energy, and it's really hard to parallelize, that is, I can't easily deeply empathize with a dozen people at once.<p>What a lot of normal people seem to be good at is a doing a first-order approximation of other people's intentions and motivations, a shallow type of empathy if you will.

From 1996 to 2006, every state enacted graduated driving laws that make it more cumbersome for young people to get licenses. 'Young people must now take more behind-the-wheel training (which is more expensive), fulfill additional requirements for permits, and once they are allowed to drive, they are often restricted to driving in the daytime without passengers.'""<p>That's at least part of it, although the article notes that the percentage change in young people without driver licenses is only from 21 percent in 2001 to 26 percent recently. My oldest son is plenty old enough to drive, and making enough money to get driver training and make payments on a car (he has no student debt), but he lives in New York City, so he has little occasion to drive. He's probably more used to using public transportation in general than many Americans because we all used public transportation to get everywhere when we lived overseas.<p>Our second son is also old enough to drive, and we will spring for his driving lessons if he desires to take them. But he can get to and from high school and many of his activities on foot (we live only a couple miles from the high school) or by bicycle, and of course we offer him rides when he needs rides. So he hasn't had much occasion to drive either.<p>On my part, as an aging Baby Boomer, I'm looking forward eagerly to the era of self-driving cars, when I can ride but not drive, and eventually cease buying vehicles, rather simply subscribing to a self-driving on-demand car service.",1366689157

Many <i>also</i> work to whitelist specific lists of known legitimate email providers.<p>May <i>enterprise</i> IT organizations require explicit whitelisting of domains from which email is sent.

Usually database systems are heavily constraint by the I/O bandwidth of the system - even the cheapest consumer CPU is able to process data orders of magnitude faster than discs are able to deliver new data.<p>That is why database servers usually have the fastest discs money can buy, as much memory as you can fit in there in order to keep as much data as possible in main memory and the largest possible caches to avoid hitting the relatively slow memory bus as often as possible. The situation becomes much worse if the database is not read-only because all changes have to be persisted and you have to hit the disc on every change.<p>Therefore I think using GPUs will buy you nothing for common database application - processor speed was never your problem. But this does not exclude the possibility that there are operation, for example correlating millions of data points from your data set, where the processing power of GPUs comes handy, but this is most likely not what you will see in one of your line of business applications.<p>The number 700,000 is probably the result of a highly tuned GPU implementation versus a general purpose CPU implementation.

Of course, smartphones are already useful for a lot of things besides checking Facebook. There's a reason they were so popular among businessmen even before the iPhone pushed them into the mainstream.<p>The real question is whether or not 'the masses' (and <i>especially</i> teenagers) will pick up on the things, though. Smartphones followed in the cell phone's wake. So 'Facebook' might actually be a selling point, unless Facebook hatred picks up first (an extreme dislike for Facebook being yet another thing that essentially no one outside the techie-sphere shares).",1366686457

I'll write out a function and then later realize I need to use a subset of it somewhere else, so I refactor it out to its own function. Or I'll realize I've now extended the same class twice, so I create a better abstraction. It's much easier to create well designed code when you actually see a need for something in the source and do it, instead of starting first with some fancy design pattern you saw someone else use on another project. I mostly focus on getting the small, granular stuff right the first time and keep an eye out for any larger problems being created in the code.",1366686277

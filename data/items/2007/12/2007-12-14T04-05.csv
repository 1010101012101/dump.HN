The first method is horrible, the second is decent.""<p>""For instance, with the text tool, text format options appear, and seem to work when you click on them, but they don't have any effect unless you already have text selected.""<p>""Each click with the text tool created a new layer, so very soon I had accidentally created 10 extra layers containing nothing but empty text objects."" (Excepting the fact that empty (sub-)layers in Fireworks are destroyed when you exit them.)<p>""...there are ""Apply"" and ""Cancel"" buttons at the top of the screen, and nothing else will work until you have clicked one of those two buttons"" and ""you can only rotate the image by clicking and dragging a small unmarked region in the extreme corner.""",1197607254
89426,comment,89354,89354,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"These analogies are terrible. The invention of the spreadsheet may have greatly increased the sophistication of the financial projections that you can run while sitting at your desk, but it has hardly made accountants and MBAs obsolete. Quite the contrary, actually. Now it takes a friggin' Ph.D. in mathematical physics to understand finance.<p>The ability to make dimensioned drawings with Visio doesn't make you an engineer. The ability to type stuff into Wordpress doesn't make you a web developer. Excel has powerful statistical functions built in, but using it doesn't make you a statistician. And blist may succeed in putting Microsoft Access and phpMyAdmin to shame, but I find it hard to believe that it will displace DBAs. It is much more likely that this new tool will allow users to get much, much farther into their data-gathering project before their search speed bogs down, they accidentally delete their data, they get bored doing complicated queries by hand, or they discover that people's last names can actually change over time. After which they will hire a DBA.<p>Which is not to say that I don't look forward to trying out blist, because I'm no big fan of Microsoft Access.",1197607190

Jesus... not only this sentence makes no sense (""AJAX"" is just one stupid function call), but the idea of running everything ""online"" is just silly. <p>WHY would I want to screw myself in the butt by using ""online apps"" for editing my digital camera photos? Why would I want to wait hours for 2GB of photos to get uploaded at 35kb/sec and then limit myself to a pathetic subset of perfectly functioning desktop application?<p>Because there are many techies out there who are greedy and fail to innovate, preferring to re-implement tiny fractions of existing software instead. And burning someone else's millions in the process.<p>I will not be surprised if we'll see hard drive formatting utilities, backed by VC millions, running inside of the browser, so you can ""Format your Drive from Anywhere!!!""<p>A lot of Valley people need to stop drinking kool-aid and read uncov.com more often.",1197607124

89418,comment,89233,89300,0,0,jacobolus,,,"First, this is a silly ad hominem criticism; their arguments have little to do with their Enso application.  But either way, these humanized guys are in general on top of things, and their thoughts about interface design are usually quite insightful.  Implementing good interfaces, and insightfully criticizing interfaces, are two very different skills.<p>Second, while I personally love Quicksilver, it has a significant learning curve.  Enso's model is, for better or worse, rather simpler.  And beyond that, experimentation is good.  A direct clone of Quicksilver would be both out of place on windows, and also much less interesting to create than a new application, with its own ideas.<p>Third, what the hell is Launchy?",1197605951

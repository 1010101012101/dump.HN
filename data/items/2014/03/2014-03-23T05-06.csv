7452310,comment,7451879,7452243,2,0,saurik,,,"FWIW, I also would not claim that this is malicious: however, I still do not feel like these algorithms build a better news feed experience. I often go to Facebook, scroll through all the content for the day, and don&#x27;t find enough of what I actually care about: it filters what it thinks are the top things from the day, and shows this content in something vaguely approximating chronological order. If a site is going to do this fancy filtering, I want a &quot;no, show me more&quot; button: I follow enough things that the idea that I would reach the end of the content posted recently is silly.<p>That said, I think a key issue here is that I feel these algorithms are &quot;solving the wrong problems&quot;... if a friend is using some game and keeps posting from from it, everyone needs to realize that isn&#x27;t the game&#x27;s fault: that friend is choosing to post that stuff as they actually care about that game. They hope--they might even expect--that people are seeing that content: if your friend is spam, maybe you should unfollow your friend (Facebook thankfully now lets you do this without unfriending them, which might have political consequences ;P).<p>This is important, as if a different person were playing that same game, the importance of the content might be fundamentally different: there are people in my life whom I would love to see those silly game posts from, to the point where it would make my day to see the games being played: if nothing else, I would know they are still alive and active (if maybe wasting their time and energy ;P).<p>This is true if everything, not just games, and frankly seems to come down to pretty simple use cases: use cases that I would be shocked if it turned out most people didn&#x27;t share. I have one friend that loves taking photographs, and they all kind of suck; I have another whose photographs are downright awe inspiring: I want to follow the photos from the second one, and not the first. I don&#x27;t want more of the second and fewer of the first, I don&#x27;t want the Photos app itself to be judged somehow &quot;this guy seems to like photos more than games&quot;, I just want to see the second guy&#x27;s photos and not the first (and maybe the first guy&#x27;s gaming, and not the second&#x27;s ;P).<p>I say this is a common use case, as I swear everyone I know complains about similar issues: I have a friend who, despite having marked his wife as &quot;Close Friend&quot;, misses content she posts (something I didn&#x27;t believe, until I had it happen to me as well: some kinds of content isn&#x27;t considered relevant enough for a notification even if you insist that all that user&#x27;s content is relevent). I have another who only uses Facebook to post links and photos, and most people I talk to love her links but don&#x27;t care about her photos (especially in one particular album: it would be great to be able to mark someone &quot;Close Friend&quot; and then unfollow one album ;P).<p>I thereby end up returning to what I had said in my previous comment: I followed the pages I do because I liked their content... because I wanted to see more of their content... because that content made me happy. If that content doesn&#x27;t make me happy, I want to think I&#x27;m responsible enough to unfollow the page, and I want to believe I live in a world where others are also capable of this.<p>I also do not think any algorithm is going to figure this out automatically: I follow the page of a movie that posts quotes and screengrabs from the film. Like the comics in a newspaper, these snippets are a familiar and beneficial part of my perusal of Facebook: they are part of what I enjoy about visiting the website. I never comment on the screengrabs, nor do I &quot;like&quot; them (I would rather others not know what sappy parts of the sappy movie I&#x27;m most connecting with today ;P)... I&#x27;m not even clicking them... I have no clue how Facebook would ever figure out I want to see those, all of those, if it is going to insist on ignoring my explicit &quot;I want to follow this Page&quot; request :(.",1395554146

7452304,comment,7451835,7452255,6,0,x0x0,,,"Sorry, but that&#x27;s nonsensical.<p>1 - virtually no supposed 5x or 10x programmer makes even 2x more.  If people are really 5x, why on earth don&#x27;t I see $300-$500k salaries?  Particularly given the fall in communication costs ala Brooks, it would be an enormous win for employers<p>2 - at least in the bay area, there would be tons and tons of highly qualified candidates if moving to the bay area wasn&#x27;t a financial nightmare (cost of living is horrific and the pay doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to making up for it); and if buying a decent 3 bedroom home and having kids didn&#x27;t nearly require winning a startup lottery -- or at least enough for a good downpayment to get to a conforming mortgage.<p>3 - I&#x27;m in my 30s, and in my cohort of developers I know a number (all of them very skilled and in high demand in the bay area) who have moved to the midwest  or austin because financially they&#x27;re so much better off<p>4 - the majority of complaints about unavailability of developers, particularly in the bay area, are after the fact justifications to (1) cover employers not paying salaries commensurate with the cost of living, and (2) the ability to import (cheaper, more easily controlled) h1b labor<p>4a - with a side of companies ducking their responsibilities to america, the state they are in, and their communities to help create the employees they need.  Now obviously I don&#x27;t think 1-4 person startups have any such responsibilities, but somewhere between that and google/fb/hp companies have responsibilities to their communities and countries that bay area companies in particular almost completely duck.  For example, why isn&#x27;t facebook or google, in lieu of whinging about difficulty hiring (while illegally restraining wages, ain&#x27;t that beautiful) running hacker schools themselves?  It couldn&#x27;t be because they&#x27;d rather let someone else pay for it and cherry pick the winners (saving money two ways)?",1395553890

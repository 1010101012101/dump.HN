I&#x27;ve always had a constellation of health issues, probably genetic, and constant anxiety and was one of the most detrimental to just getting on in life, and later I had much trouble sleeping, either not being able to get to sleep or not sleeping for very long.<p>I researched nutrition and genetics for many years and tried a number of supplements based on testing hypotheses I would come up with. I generally used the Linus Pauling Foundation guidance on RDA as they are annotaed with a history of how RDAs came about, whether the official RDA is optimal or not, various caveats etc.<p>Magnesium had a profound effect after I researched bioavailability and tried some of the organic forms. The two main ones that worked were magnesium glycinate and citrate.<p>I&#x27;ve also went through a phase of having a strong beneficial effect from high dose vitamin B12 (methyl form), which initially caused what I felt was deeper sleep but also intense nightmares; this effect wore off after a while and that might be due to correction of a deficiency.",1451818511

In short, the distribution of capital ownership is always more concentrated than the distribution of income from labor, so we should be worrying about wealth inequality and inheritance. This is why Piketty proposes a wealth tax, not an income tax of the kind that pg says will &#x27;be fighting a losing battle against increasing variation in productivity.&#x27;",1451818389

Seems that Pac Man had better ghosts than the baddies in this game, still felt I had to watch it to the end.<p>From what I remember there was no discussion of how to actually do copy protection in magazine articles, as in the early magazines that published reams of assembly or hex that you could type in, yet, concurrent with this era there were plenty of copy protection schemes, as evidenced. So it was not as if you could easily use a few well known tools and techniques to obfuscate code. People were very much on their own but the games companies would have been able to put resources into protection and learn how others do it. This know how must have travelled word of mouth between publishers and developers as copy protection was vital for revenue in an era when everything was instantly copied and shared as a matter of course. What else were games for?!?<p>Anyway I think that even though there was not a lot of published material on obfuscation there must have been those that were well connected enough to know a library of techniques for copy protection. These guys would have found work with games publishers, their work being integral to publication. This was by then just capitalism and the resultant specialisms in the marketplace.",1451818137

If there is a single feasible way to become poor, then <i>some</i> people would go that way, and we have failed that obligation. The flaw is not in my logic.<p>Even with strong social security net, you cannot stop people from being poor. The strong social security net would represent the lowest level of income. At the lowest level of income in a society, you&#x27;re poor, as everyone else is making more than you do. If someone was working and making less than what the social security provides, then they can just stop working and be better off at the security net level.<p>No matter how strong the social security net, the people resting on it will always be the poorest in the society.<p>Speaking from experience (grown up in a communist country, living in Western Europe atm), even the strongest form of state-forced salaries/job availability did not prevent people from becoming poor.

People might say shit they wouldn&#x27;t while sober (true or otherwise), but alcohol isn&#x27;t some magical truth serum and plenty of secrets have been kept while hammered. Very few people are out to get you, and if you&#x27;re using alcohol to detect such a bias you&#x27;re using the wrong tool.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why a drunk person&#x27;s actions should be representative of their &quot;real&quot; selves anyway. Does a drunk person&#x27;s meandering path indicate they&#x27;re actually faking the ability to walk straight while sober? No. And what about the person who becomes more lively and silly when drunk? Are they faking being calmer while sober? Doubtful. People are different when they&#x27;re drunk and they&#x27;re just a stupider version of themselves, not necessarily a truer one.<p>I know people who choose not to drink because they consistently made bad choices when drunk that didn&#x27;t fit with their &quot;real&quot; nature. I see that as a sign of a responsible person, not a less trustworthy friend. Some I know have been traumatized by an alcoholic parent. I don&#x27;t trust them any less because of this. I know others who just don&#x27;t like the taste of alcohol. Everyone has personal tastes; I don&#x27;t like spicy food. There are others that will drink but not drink to excess because they don&#x27;t enjoy wasting a day to a hangover. I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re not trying to pull the wool over my eyes.<p>Most importantly, there are also those who are actual alcoholics, for whom alcohol interferes with their physical and mental health, together with their ability to make progress towards their life goals. If you can&#x27;t trust someone because they stopped making a bad choice, I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re looking for in a person. Personally I&#x27;m happy when someone stops a destructive action.<p>Arguing that you can&#x27;t trust someone that doesn&#x27;t drink is anachronistic and founded on specious reasoning. Most people drink and some don&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t assume that someone&#x27;s sobriety or desire to stay in control (they may just be a control freak) is a sign they&#x27;re trying to hide their true selves from me, because that just doesn&#x27;t make sense. For some people drinking is fun and cool, but for others it&#x27;s unpleasant, destructive, irresponsible, and distressing.<p>* I&#x27;m going to interpret a &quot;fake front&quot; as the intention to maliciously misrepresent and deceive for some sort of personal gain at a loss to someone else.",1451816536

It just proves that each transaction is signed by someone holding the right signature. Nothing in your scheme prevents multiple diverging chains. The entire point of the confirmations etc. used by blockchains is that not only each individual transaction can be verified as coming from a specific source, but that the chain as a whole can be verified to meet certain criteria - specifically in the case of e.g. Bitcoin, the criteria that it represents the view of the majority of the mining power of the network.<p>No, this is wrong. I can sign a chain of transactions (Merkle tree is used in BTC as well), and you will know it came from me. If I&#x27;m a central authority, I can keep signing it in all of perpetuity, and it will be verifiably from me. As long as you trust the signer, it&#x27;s very simple.<p>The reason Bitcoin is different is because you want to be able to have different signers doing each block. The way bitcoin does it is through clever incentives: miners only believe that other miners care about the longest chain, and they want to sign that last block because then the other miners will recognise their mined coins.",1451816519

They did switch me on a new contract automatically when my 2 year contract ended. And that new contract was priced 3x the normal rate, and it&#x27;s a 1-month contract they renew every month until I cancel.<p>So it&#x27;s not &#x27;a lot of effort&#x27;, they did switch my contract, but instead of switching to a normal one they switched me to a 3x overpriced one at a rate they don&#x27;t actually offer to customers on their website.<p>As for the gains, well that&#x27;s the whole point of my post, the gains on me were huge: they&#x27;re making money by silently switching me to a ridiculously overpriced contract on the basis of a tiny-letter clause in a contract of a few years back. About a third of the money they extracted from me so far is for non-service, money they&#x27;d only make when the customer is lazy/ignorant enough to not spot the exploitation. That&#x27;s the definition of &#x27;gotcha pricing&#x27;, isn&#x27;t it?<p>As for the switching part... That&#x27;s true for 2 year contracts. I hate being called up for that, because I&#x27;m just locking myself in to another 2 years. I&#x27;d rather sit this one out, and then get a great deal myself on the next one. But in this case it didn&#x27;t apply because they renewed me for an indefinite 1-month contract at 3x their own market rate, they could&#x27;ve just as easily either 1) automatically and silently renewed at their NORMAL prices they actually charge in their shop for a 1 month contract, I wouldn&#x27;t even be involved in that and it&#x27;d be a fair deal or 2) at least call me or email (didn&#x27;t receive even a text to my phone) to inform me they RAISED my fees even though they reduced their offering to me! without necessarily pitching any new contract, merely informing me would&#x27;ve been nice.<p>I mean, to give you a sense of the deal they got me on silently (without a single notification) vs the normal market rates in their store right now: They have an offer in their store that costs 30% less than what I pay now. That offer gives me 50% more minutes and 400% more megabytes than what I have right now, on a 4G connection instead of 3G right now, with a free 1 year old model of an iPhone (5S) included, vs no phone part of the contract I have right now.<p>And they never even informed me of this bs, it&#x27;s textbook gotcha pricing. I&#x27;m not saying T-Mobile is a crappy company, just that in my anecdotal case, they screwed over a customer with a shitty clause in their contract to take advantage of the fact customers tend not to review a services&#x27; fees a few years into a contract. There are fair and practical alternatives to that, but they chose gotcha pricing instead. I don&#x27;t think you can see it any other way.<p>> But seriously, call t mobile and ask if there&#x27;s anything hey can do<p>Yeah as I said already contacted them, they&#x27;re getting back to me.",1451816273

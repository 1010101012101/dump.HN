And {...} was already taken for list construction.<p>When what you're doing in Mathematica looks more like mathematics than programming, you don't need a lot of subscripts. Presumably that's why subscripting is the thing that got the ugly notation with extra characters.<p>(The thing I find most unpleasant about programming in Mathematica is the way it tries to use pattern-matching as the single fundamental tool. This gives Mathematica programming, for me, something of the same feel as getting a macro-expansion based system like bash or TeX to do tricky things.

1950006,comment,1949809,1949809,0,0,ajessup,,,"I've written sites in both Rails and Drupal, and so am somewhat qualified to say... it doesn't matter. Have your guy pick what he feels most comfortable with and run with it. Either Drupal or Rails would be a fine choice.<p>This is especially true if you're in a rapid, early prototyping stage. It's FAR more important that your guy can implement and test your ideas quickly using best practices he (or she) already understands, rather than scratching heads learning an unfamiliar framework.<p>For what it's worth, from what you've mentioned about your project, if you'd hired me I'd have probably recommended Drupal for this project - IF you know what you're doing, the basics of a Yelp-style review service can be implemented pretty quickly using user-contributed modules in Drupal, and you get a bunch of things (basic user and community management, action level ACLs, RDF, blogs, and regular CMS style functions etc.) for free. You just need to apply a theme and away you go. Drupal is a great fit for your use-case.<p>The catch is that the learning curve to Drupal is substantial - sitting as it does in a strange gray area between being a CMS and a framework, it's got some strange idioms that take some time to appreciate. If I was new to Drupal, the time saved by having those functions built for me would likely be more than offset offset by the effort I would spend trying to hack/understand Drupals themeing layer, get modules to play nice together etc. Futher Drupal is essentially written in a functional style (few objects at all to be found), which may be a bit of a mindf&*k for someone coming from an OO framework like Rails.<p>There's also the PHP/Ruby issue - best practices for deploying a Ruby on Rails app (and scaling it) are in many ways quite different from deploying a Drupal/PHP app. Neither is 'better' necessarily, but bear in mind it may also be a whole set of new skills your guy has to master.<p>Both Drupal and Rails scale very well (assuming you use them right, of course). Whitehouse.gov runs Drupal, and the front-end of Twitter ran on Rails (at least until recently). If you ever hit levels of scale beyond what these sites need... well that's a good problem to have :)<p>Finally, if you do decide to use (or at least try) Drupal, make sure you check out the Drush and Aegir projects, which will help enormously in deployment.",1291031076

1950002,comment,1949663,1949663,0,0,voidpointer,,,"I think he is comparing apples to oranges here. Using HTMl as the ""rendering device"" works on a different (higher) level of abstraction. The additional layer of abstraction in HTML has already solved the complexity of doing efficient partial redraws based on changes to a subset of a scene graph. This isn't something that the canvas API was meant to handle. If one were to use a scene graph (or display list) abstraction on top of canvas, it would shield the application developer from this complexity just as well as the HTML does now. However, the HTML abstraction, although more general, is implemented in native code while a canvas based scene-graph would need to go through java-script, so it is at a disadvantage as to how far it can be optimized. Basically, what he needs is SVG. :-)",1291030880

Having pride in your work can be the elbow grease that keeps you learning after Photoshop quits.<p>Moreover, consider the position of a designer in a startup. You are often outnumbered by engineers, who can mindmeld to solve really tricky problems; you are responsible for the coltish first days of the company brand; you are the de-facto copy-writer, publicist, and user advocate. You are the weak link in the iteration chain; if you call in sick, there's no one to put lipstick on the pig. Engineers will force you to defend decisions you experienced as intuitions, and there is little expectation that engineers learn your professional vocabulary. (See: for example, the sneering aside the author makes about typographic leading)<p>In response to that pressure, I've learned that it's important to refocus on what the user needs. If most users are newcomers, and the front page has a gigantic bounce rate, then it's time to throw down some dank design work. (If the engineers balk, explain and continue). If most users bounce on the FAQ, maybe its time to think about ""vertical rhythm,"" or typeface choices, or navigation schemes.<p>As long as you're fighting for the user, there's no harm in picking your battles.

When building profit, you need to keep costs as low as possible. When building revenue, you increase costs as much as you can afford in a way that grows revenue as fast as possible, perhaps throwing even the idea of profit out the door.<p>Focusing on revenue is awesome. Throwing in the extra ""and profit"" feels like the safe thing to do, but in reality your execution will be completely different with profit in the equation.",1291029744

It does not seem to be related to spreading gains or risks.<p>I have not seen any comparative table of stock churn rates for different funds, but my guess is that index funds do well because they reduce the sell-buy transaction costs, partly by eliminating the cost of human stock pickers, but primarily by reducing the percentage of stocks in the fund that are sold then bought every year. Maybe this is wrong?<p>My understanding is that an index fund sells and buys stocks to balance the proportions held in the fund as the market capitalisation of the companies changes inside the index. This imposes an apparently unnecessary cost on the fund. If we removed this cost by not selling and buying stocks to keep it equal to the index would the fund become more profitable? I am considering it to be a fund where people invest incrementally over a long period so there would be constant random aquisition of new stocks from the index.<p>Maybe that doesn't make sense for some reason.",1291029713

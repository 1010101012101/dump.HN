I was under the impression that the Mac license reads 'You
agree not to install, use or run the Apple Software on any non-Apple-branded computer, or to enable others to do so.' because they cannot legally require that the OS only operates on Apple hardware. Therefore if, if a manufacturer wishes to use the OS, they would need to provide Apple branding. At the same time, this may be the catch-22. You can't use apple branding without the permission of Apple, and you can't install the OS without using the branding.",1254185641

Mobile phones make things such as informal jobs a lot easier (e.g. if someone wants to organise labour for a project).<p>The problem still however is price. In China it costs 0.15 Yuan to send a text message – in SA it can be the equivalent the equivalent of 1 Yuan. Voice calls are even more expensive (R3+ a minute – about 0.4 US$). I believe that the price elsewhere in Africa is even more expensive (since some of the base stations run on Diesel generators).<p>I also don’t think that telecoms growth should be seen as economic growth (it is not always coupled). Telecoms is however still a giant problem. In SA we have huge problems with extremely expensive Internet. This is extremely unfavourable.

What's worse is, if a slave is far enough behind, it's possible that it will never catch up (hint: think about I/O contention with replication and whether it's possible to separate logs adequately). Once that happens, it's full dump time. Anything remotely fancy, like filtering out certain schemas (which MySQL calls ""database,"" but it's really just a namespace), and a single developer discovering cross-schema UPDATEs, and That's All She Wrote.<p>With Slony, after learning the admittedly bizarre administrative interface, everything was a dream. Swapping master and slave is fast and easy, even if there are other slaves out there. Full dump? Never heard of it! Certainly, slony does do the equivalent when bringing up a new slave, but the locking requirement is nowhere near as onerous, nor is the overall performance hit.  Replication happens at the table level, not the whole database.<p>The amount of time I've spent fixing broken MySQL replication easily dwarfs the amount of time I've spent learning and experimenting and fixing (after breaking on purpose, usually) Slony.",1254183926

This can be seen very readily in the MDY v Blizzard case that's going on right now.  Blizzard claims that they only license the game to you, even though you bought a physical copy at a store front.  Because they own the game and you only license it they can say that you don't have the right to modify the memory.   You would essentially be bound to anything they want to put in their EULA/ToS in this case.<p>This does have a very chilling effect on archival systems.  When you aren't able to format-shift a piece of media or it is bound to only one player then eventually you will loose access to that media, either through hardware failure or obsolescence.<p>Copyright law section 117 gives you a lot of rights for software you've purchased and owned, but treating it as a license circumvents that clause and gives the publisher full control.<p><a href=""http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/you-bought-it-you-own-it-mdy-v-blizzard-appealed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/you-bought-it-you-own-i...</a>",1254183034

The way this worked on PalmOS was completely sane. They went and fucked up their whole process when they switched to WebOS.<p>I assume this is because they hired the majority of the WebOS management team from Apple, pushing out the people who did it right in the PalmOS years, and those new people are idiots.</i><p>I'm not sure it's safe to assume that this process is <i>stupid</i>. Palm did, indeed, copy all of this straight from Apple's playbook. Apple's App Store is <i>wildly successful</i>. It may have issues from the perspective of <i>some developers</i>, but that's not the only perspective that matters. Palm isn't trying to make a bunch of developers happy. They're trying to sell phones and make <i>users</i> happy.<p>Whether you can make users just as happy without requiring developers to jump through hoops remains to be seen. One could easily argue that it's possible, but I'd like to see evidence of that in the real world. I don't think the software ecosystems for desktop computers are a fair comparison. The ecosystems for older Palm devices, which jwz references here, were never nearly as successful as Apple's App Store. Maybe that suggests that the hoops somehow help the user experience? I don't know. But it looks like Palm is assuming that it does.<p>I agree that this whole process seems completely broken from jwz's perspective, but it's hard to say that Palm had people ""who did it right in the PalmOS years"" when they never got it right in the category that matters: number of app sales. That could be 100% attributable to the iPhone's superiority, not the App Store's, though.",1254182624

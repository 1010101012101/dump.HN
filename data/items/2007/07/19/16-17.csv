Of course, that barely matters; he is there to sell phones.<p>In this sense it's a pretty smart move to make a celebrity a plankowner.  I'd even call it _innovative_.  They'll probably do well.",1184863847

I'm sure Seth Levine was all to happy to provide them the material. But how would you feel if you were a Techstars startup group and you see him making comments like that - blasting the model of his partner's program!?",1184861885

35302,comment,35232,35232,0,0,garbowza,,,"The nature of email is certainly shifting towards business dealings, as this article states. However, it's more than that: traditional email is also becoming a message aggregator. As social utilities, such as Facebook, MySpace, etc continue to utilize their own messaging systems, email acts as a feed reader to notify you when you have a message in any of your more specialized systems. So rather than it being the message itself, it becomes the messenger of a message. ",1184861158
35301,comment,35015,35252,0,0,cperciva,,,"Then you're still wrong.  I quote from the article: ""For example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for 6% of your company. In this case, n is .06 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.064. So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your average outcome by more than 6.4%.""<p>If by ""average outcome"" you mean ""expected value of the utility function"", and assuming that my utility-of-money function is sqrt($), I don't need to improve my ""average outcome"" by more than 6.4% for the deal to be worth accepting; it's enough if I can increase my ""average outcome"" by 3.2%, since that's how much UTILITY giving up 6% of the MONEY costs me.\n",1184861145

6945830,comment,6945415,6945644,2,0,tsax,,,"I don&#x27;t think too many people prefer the concrete-and-wall environs of HK compared to the Victorian promenades of SF. However, we are all constrained by reality and scarcity. There is scarcity of space in SF. It must be alleviated by either increasing supply or suppressing/diverting demand. If supply is increased to a much larger extent, an HK scenario is possible which might decrease subsequent demand due to reduced aesthetic value. There are no perfect states here, and choices must be made. Restrictions can stay in place, however, no one should delude themselves into thinking that this isn&#x27;t a cartelized capture of value by existing property owners in bed with the city council. It doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t support this option, but the reality must be kept in mind.",1387601931
6945829,comment,6940665,6941442,5,0,justintroutman,,,"I noticed some things that concern me, and while I neither have an active attack, or the time* to formalize one, I&#x27;ll leave these concerns here for discussion, and take part when time permits.<p>First, the KDF really bugs me. Essentially, 128 bits of the data that&#x27;s used to generate the AES key is derived from msg_key, which is the SHA-1 of plaintext+some_other_jazz. Also, only some of the auth_key&#x27;s bits are used, along with the plaintext-dependent msg_key, as food for the KDF. What this could mean is that you&#x27;re really diluting your effective keyspace. (Partially) deriving a key from the hash of public data doesn&#x27;t smell like good crypto-hygiene, and intuition tells me there&#x27;s the potential for leaking key bits if I query it enough, or collect a lot of ciphertext traffic.<p>Second, there&#x27;s no integrity checking going on with the ciphertext, so I could easily ask the server to decrypt anything; don&#x27;t give me that freedom, because maybe I can fool you into doing something worse. Also, if you were doing Encrypt-then-MAC, like any good boy should, you&#x27;d save yourself from wasting decryptions on bogus ciphertext. This is one reason I can&#x27;t buy the performance-driven reasoning for using Methuselah&#x27;s hand-me-down modes; modern modes are safer and likely faster. It&#x27;s akin to paying more for used, squeaky parts, when you can pay less for new, more efficient parts.<p>To a cryptographer, the one thing we learn early in our careers is that it doesn&#x27;t pay to be different when it comes to choosing primitives and protocols. When we find things that work, and have earned their bones, we recycle them in new designs and continue building upon the confidence we have in them by carrying on with cryptanalysis, building and breaking proofs, and so forth. There are no bonus points for those who deviate, because, really, the battle we&#x27;re losing isn&#x27;t that of the cryptography itself; rather, it&#x27;s the way we implement it and the way we interface it. Implementation is the friend of no one; do not make it harder for yourself.<p>I&#x27;ve been a little candid, I know, but mostly because to many of us, what we&#x27;re looking at is a Goldbergian gauntlet of decision-making that leaves us asking ourselves, &quot;Okay, they took the long way home, but did they get there?&quot; If there&#x27;s a gain, I&#x27;m not seeing it, and the defense isn&#x27;t leaving me optimistic that we will.<p>With all sincerity, and admiration for your desire to help others reap the benefits of cryptography, if enough of us tell you that there&#x27;s a better, safer, and quicker way to getting this right, would you lend us an ear?<p>- Justin<p>P.S. I&#x27;m okay with being wrong, but I&#x27;m more concerned with helping you get things right.<p>*I have a toddler.",1387601887

The thing about transitioning is that it&#x27;s a long process, there are many points where you can turn back if it&#x27;s not working, and not everyone takes the same steps anyway.<p>For some people, &quot;The Surgery&quot;, (sometimes called Sexual Reassignment Surgery, but many people prefer the term Gender Confirmation Surgery, or just &quot;bottom surgery&quot;, as opposed to breast implants which are &quot;top surgery&quot;), is the main thing, but for an awful lot of people, it isn&#x27;t -- even though most non-trans folk seem to think of it that way. For a lot of trans people, living day to day life as their real gender is the important thing, and they&#x27;re not so hung up on what&#x27;s between their legs. For some people, hormones help them feel like they&#x27;re &quot;supposed to&quot;, and that&#x27;s the main thing. For others, they hate their chest, and top surgery is most important. While others may think that Facial Feminization Surgery (FFS) is the most crucial -- not least because for many trans women, FFS is the difference between passing and not passing, which makes an enormous practical difference in day-to-day life and often even in terms of personal safety.<p>For me, I&#x27;ve read a lot about this, including many personal accounts, and heard a number of first hand stories from a group I&#x27;ve started attending. I honestly don&#x27;t know how things will work out for me if/when I start transitioning. I&#x27;ve heard enough horror stories to go into the process with the appropriate level of fear and caution.<p>But at some point when your life becomes one big well of depression that doesn&#x27;t respond to medication and you start to lose your ability to function in day-to-day life, there&#x27;s really nothing left to do but start trying to explore the remaining options.

I can&#x27;t see how pretending the problem doesn&#x27;t exist is going to change anything.<p>Convincing nearly everybody to artificially deflate the market simply won&#x27;t work, no matter how many conscientious people are involved, because it literally only takes one moneyed asshole to arbitrage the system into exactly how it is now, except now we&#x27;ve got one developer with all the money instead of many homeowners with parts of the money... but either way, the net result is the same, property prices are higher.<p>I agree that coerced exodus isn&#x27;t pretty, but as I understand it, real estate in Oakland is downright cheap by comparison, and it&#x27;s a very short commute away (though I&#x27;ve never done the bridge in traffic).<p>As for your other example, picking an unhip district and moving there is just more of the same problem.  If everybody did that, there&#x27;d just be even more displacement from even more places.  I don&#x27;t know of any ungentrified areas in San Francisco, but while you might be able to find a place in a Tenderloin-esque sort of place for cheap, any attempts at making it nice also makes it appealing to others, and the cycle repeats.<p>The core of the problem is that supply is artificially constrained, and demand is high.  This leads to the expected raise in price for the good demanded, and is the basic tenet of economy that&#x27;s been taught for almost 100 years.  It&#x27;s not a law, but markets, rational or irrational, tend to follow its prescriptions, and in this case, the markets are acting rationally.  The easy solution is to unconstrain supply, which requires petitioning the San Francisco (and possibly surrounding) legislatures to change lessen building restrictions, not hating on Google.<p>Rent control is possibly an option as well, which San Francisco already has, but it isn&#x27;t apparently working.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because the Ellis act is being exploited or because rent control is generally exploitative to property owners, or some other combination of factors that I&#x27;m not aware of.<p>Editing to clarify a point -- I&#x27;m not asserting that rent control is exploitative. I&#x27;ve seen compelling arguments for and against them, but I don&#x27;t have any domain-specific knowledge or information above and beyond what I&#x27;ve read on the internet -- just stating that as a possibility.",1387599082

Get rid of the buses, and the tech employees will move closer to work.

Turning Oakland into a bedroom community for silicon valley does nothing for the people who have lived in Oakland for decades -- they&#x27;re raising rents far more than they&#x27;re building low-income housing with the taxes on their rent checks.<p>If the tech companies want to encourage their employees to live in Oakland, they should open offices in Oakland, pay their taxes in Oakland, and otherwise encourage people to live, work and play <i>in Oakland</i>.

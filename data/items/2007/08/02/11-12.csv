The contracting business would be a lot less healthy if this wasn't the case. Everything else you said is correct from what I know -- at least in California.<p>The neat thing about the labor laws in California (and some other states) is that they protect you from signing away lots of other rights as a full-time employee. It's difficult to enforce non-competes against former employees for example.",1186055813

Now you're using their IP to provide someone else (who may be their competitor) with something for competitive purposes.  It's NOT up to you to determine who is competing with whom, how important someone's IP is to them. or whether or not ""it's a big deal"".  I've seen multi-million dollar deals terminated and careers sidetracked when there was even a hint of impropriety in the air.  DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE how important most business people feel about this issue.<p>Of course, no one owns what's in your brain, but that's all you own.  Move on.",1186055592

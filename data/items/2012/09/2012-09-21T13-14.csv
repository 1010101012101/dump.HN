Note that I'm the Vagrant creator, not a VirtualBox hacker, not a kernel hacker (though I've had my fair share of both in the past few years).<p>There is a feature of Intel CPUs called VT-x extensions. Without going into detail: VT-x is set of features built natively into some intel processors to improve virtualization. Any recent desktop/laptop Intel processor has these. For reasons unknown to me, these extensions are typically disabled by default. VirtualBox, VMWare, Parallels all contain code to enable these automatically for you. Enabling VT-x extensions requires ring-0 (kernel level) API calls. Therefore, it is up to the kernel extension to enable these.<p>Mac OS X 10.6 and greater supports native kernel APIs for doing this[1]. Prior to 10.6, you'd have to directly query the CPUs and modify CPU registers yourself, and icky business prone to some massive failure. Native APIs are pretty nice. In Darwin (the OS X kernel), these APIs are `host_vmxon` and `host_vmxoff`. These are very easy to use, you just call them. Mac OS X does all the internal accounting to verify that the CPU supports VT-x, VT-x isn't already enabled, etc. It also supports this feature called _exclusive_ access to VT-x. By passing `true` to `host_vmxon`, you're requesting _exclusive_ access to the VT-x extensions. If this succeeds, then until you call `host_vmxoff` again, no other application can call `host_vmxon` (a `VMX_IN_USE` error is returned).<p>It turns out that Mac OS X 10.8.2 on Ivy Bridge CPUs has a bug where this accounting is broken. No application actually is using VT-x extensions but `host_vmon` returns `VMX_IN_USE` anyways. This is what broke VirtualBox in 10.8.2. Now, I do want to note that this is 100% an Apple issue. VirtualBox was using a publicly exposed API at the kernel level and assuming that such an API would be stable. I would say this is a safe assumption. Unfortunately, here we are with the situation we have today.<p>Now, you must be asking: But I heard (or saw) that VMWare and Parallels were not affected by this issue! How did that happen? In time, friends, in time. I will explain this soon.<p>Next, on to how VirtualBox worked around this issue. The changeset[2] is pretty simple. As part of the kernel driver initialize process, VirtualBox now calls the new method `vboxdrvDarwinResolveSymbols`. This function breaks across kernel module boundaries and searches the kernel space for a named symbol, even if that symbol is not exported for public access. Specifically, it searches for the symbols ""vmx_resume,"" ""vmx_suspend,"" and ""vmx_use_count."" The first two are functions, the last is a global variable. These are the exact same APIs that the _publicly_ exposed `host_vmxon` and `host_vmxoff` call, but without the accounting or exclusivity feature.<p>So now, as part of the VMM (Virtual Machine Manager), which sits in ring-0, it will call these methods directly rather than using the `host_vmxon` function. This avoids the accounting bug that is in the kernel of 10.8.2, and we have a functional VirtualBox.<p>So how did VMWare and Parallels continue to function properly? Since they're not open source and I don't have the energy to DTrace them right now, I'll just say there are only two options. First, they can use the approach VirtualBox is now using where they search for kernel symbols of unexposed APIs and call those. Second, they can query and modify the CPU registers directly that have to do with VT-x support.<p>Based solely on my conversations with hypervisor developers at VMWare, I'm going to go with #2. The Fusion hypervisor is the same code as the vSphere hypervisor, workstation hypervisor, etc. It is all one big awesome hypervisor that is meant to run on all sorts of hardware out there. Because of this, I imagine that they have had built-in support for years for detecting various CPU models and manually enabling VT-x extensions, rather than relying on kernel-specific APIs. This is just more portable and flexible for them.<p>Anyways, the issue appears fixed and huge credit to the Oracle VirtualBox team which got this out the door in no time.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2050.9.2/osfmk/i386/vmx/vmx_cpu.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2050.9.2/osfm...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.virtualbox.org/changeset/43379/vbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.virtualbox.org/changeset/43379/vbox</a>",1348235967

Continuing dependence on Google here simply posed too much risk to ad revenue and indeed the basic integrity of their ecosystem.<p>All things considered, given how complex maps must be to implement, it seems like Apple did a pretty good job for day one.<p>Furthermore, this furore reminds me of the storm over Siri. Tech pundits work themselves into a frenzy proclaiming that Apple is losing its edge. Average consumers however pay no heed and the company rolls on to the next product launch largely unharmed. The critics miss the bigger picture: a company with so much momentum that it can easily afford to crowdsource the refinement of challenging big-data projects such as Siri and Maps.

  started yet. There's no way we can get it done by then.""

  ""I know,"" he responded, in a low voice, almost a whisper.

  ""You know? If you know the schedule is off-base, why don't
  you correct it?"" 

  ""Well, it's Steve. Steve insists that we're shipping in early 
  1982, and won't accept answers to the contrary. The best way to 
  describe the situation is a term from Star Trek. Steve has a 
  reality distortion field.""

  ""A what?""

  ""A reality distortion field. In his presence, reality is 
  malleable. He can convince anyone of practically anything.
  It wears off when he's not around, but it makes it hard to
  have realistic schedules. And there's a couple of other
  things you should know about working with Steve.""

  ""What else?""

  ""Well, just because he tells you that something is awful or
  great, it doesn't necessarily mean he'll feel that way tomorrow. 
  You have to low-pass filter his input. And then, he's really
  funny about ideas. If you tell him a new idea, he'll usually
  tell you that he thinks it's stupid. But then, if he actually
  likes it, exactly one week later, he'll come back to you and
  propose your idea to you, as if he thought of it.""

  I thought Bud was surely exaggerating, until I observed Steve
  in action over the next few weeks. The reality distortion field
  was a confounding melange of a charismatic rhetorical style, an
  indomitable will, and an eagerness to bend any fact to fit the
  purpose at hand. If one line of argument failed to persuade, he
  would deftly switch to another. Sometimes, he would throw you
  off balance by suddenly adopting your position as his own,
  without acknowledging that he ever thought differently.

  Amazingly, the reality distortion field seemed to be effective 
  even if you were acutely aware of it, although the effects would 
  fade after Steve departed. We would often discuss potential
  techniques for grounding it (see Are You Gonna Do It?), but
  after a while most of us gave up, accepting it as a force of
  nature.

  use warnings;
  use Shell ();

  use PerlX::QuoteOperator ls => {
    -emulate => 'qq',
    -with    => sub ($) { Shell::ls($_[0]) },
  }; 

  use PerlX::QuoteOperator uname => {
    -emulate => 'qq',

  use PerlX::QuoteOperator ip => {
    -emulate => 'qq',
    -with    => sub ($) { Shell::ip($_[0]) },
  }; 

  # and then...

  ls();
  uname(-a);
  ip(-4 addr);
</code></pre>
But this seems to be an overkill because I could just use Perl's backticks (<a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Quote-Like-Operators"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Quote-Like-Operators</a>)...<p><pre><code>  `ls`;
  `uname -a`;
  `ip -4 addr`;

And it works with variables...<p><pre><code>  my $x = ""/usr/local/"";
  my $files = `ls -l $x`;
</code></pre>
and piping...<p><pre><code>  my $perl_files = `ls | grep .pl`;

<i>Shell.pm</i> also works with variables & piping but I think that backticks are probably Perl's best <i>DSL</i> for dealing (easily) with shell stuff :)",1348234865

And when prices no longer reflect the company fundamentals, all sorts of bad things happen: Management is pressured to take extraordinary actions just to mitigate the market situation (stock splits/reverse-splits, stock buy-backs, accounting tricks, etc), employees freak out and quit, long-term investors get nervous, potentially fruitful M&As fail to happen, etc.<p>(The argument that technical/high-frequency trading improves the liquidity of the market is the biggest bullshit, cop-out answer ever: The only people that benefit from this type of instant liquidity are short-term, short-sighted traders ... such as the very people who advocate this type of trading, and not long-term <i>investors</i>!).<p>As for the societal cost, technical trading educates and perpetuates the myth that the stock market is a big gambling house, and not a means to become an <i>owner</i> of a company. To paraphrase Warren Buffett, every time you think about buying stock you should think of it the same way as if you were buying a mom-and-pop shop, like a pizza place. Is the price you're paying roughly equivalent to - or better than - how much you'd expect to make by pocketing the profits of the shop over the lifetime of the business?<p>I hate to leave completely negative feedback, so at least I'll give that this tool looks spiffy.<p>UPDATE: It seems like I'm getting a lot of responses from traders here. Already answered some, can't answer them all. Please sleep over these comments and think about what you could be doing with your time. Life's short.",1348233958

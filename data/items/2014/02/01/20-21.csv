The question is, at best, a vague and inaccurate heuristic measure of the thing you note. The answer to it, and follow-on questions, may have little or no bearing on the position the candidate is interviewing for.",1391288375

We are primarily looking for full-stack and UI-focused engineers, especially those with expertise in front-end data visualization / interaction. You should know modern web and mobile design principles and be particularly excited by d3.js and its associated ecosystem.<p>You&#x27;d be joining the company at a great time. Our engineering team is still small enough that we feel like an elite task force, but unlike two years ago, we are making millions in revenue and have a ridiculous amount of data to draw insight out of on behalf of our customers.<p>You should be an expert in Python and JavaScript. You should be willing to learn, or already know, technologies like Tornado, MongoDB, Redis, Postgres, and Amazon Web Services. You should be extremely handy at a UNIX command line, possessing all the skills of a sysadmin.<p>If you join, you&#x27;d become part of a team that is building one of the web&#x27;s greatest analytics companies, while also serving a strong mission: helping editors and writers at top news organizations excel in the digital medium.<p>Our software aggregates data on >5 billion pageviews per month of traffic, and we work with major media companies as customers, such as The Atlantic, Arstechnica, Mashable, The New Republic, MIT Technology Review, and many more.<p>Apply by sending a (short!) cover letter to work@parsely.com. Mention this HN post and say you&#x27;re looking for Andrew.<p>Include links to online portfolio, Github, LinkedIn, or any similar services, if you have them. If you have a Python code example that you think expresses your Python coding style, that would also be a good thing to send along -- as plain attachment, Github Gist, or similar.",1391288362

7163328,comment,7161901,7162179,6,0,jonnathanson,,,"It&#x27;s a problem of economics. The costs of making table stakes-quality mobile games has been holding steady, if not increasing. Meanwhile, the price people are willing to pay up front has been converging on $0. Something&#x27;s gotta give.<p>One could argue, and perhaps somewhat convincingly, that the mobile gaming space is in its chaotic adolescence. It started off as an undifferentiated mass market, but making games for the mass market is extremely challenging unless you&#x27;re a big publisher with economies of scale. Enter IAP, the best way to bootstrap a game and maintain cash flow over the lifetime of a given gamer.<p>So now IAP has been exploited to the hilt. It&#x27;s everywhere. It&#x27;s the new mass-market model.<p>Don&#x27;t want to do IAP? In that case, you should find a lucrative niche. Differentiate. Certain developers are doing fairly well charging large (by iOS & Android standards) up-front prices for deep games in hardcore categories. Square-Enix, for instance, routinely charges upwards of $15 for its Final Fantasy releases, and by all accounts, it&#x27;s doing just fine with them. (S-E is a fairly big publisher, but I see no reason why a small RPG shop couldn&#x27;t attempt the same, provided it got itself in front of the right initial audience.)<p>Devs and publishers who don&#x27;t have $10M+ in venture funding in the bank are going to have to make their peace with freemium, with niche pricing, or with IAP. Any of these things can be done well. IAP can be done well, for that matter. It&#x27;s not, in and of itself, an unalloyed evil. De facto-forced IAP, of the sort you need to opt into in order to pass a roadblock, is the dickish (if lucrative) way to go. But IAP that is a fun add-on to an already awesome gaming experience is a bird of a different feather.",1391287614

H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am curently the only employee) and aim to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and/or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Visit <a href=""http://amacapital.net/careers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a> to learn more, and send applications/inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.",1391287455

Unlike everyone else I am not talking programming mistakes, these are generally physical fumbles:<p>One day I was doing a change control, I was scheduled to change some settings on the modulator of a satellite system providing internet access to a portion of the Middle East. I called the satellite operator and told them I wanted to do the scheduled work, as they would have to confirm I was outputting new configuration within the constraints of the contract.<p>I entered the change and re-initiated the modulation, the operative said he was seeing nothing. Now, because this signal was going to the middle east I couldn&#x27;t see it in Europe and without substantial plumbing I couldn&#x27;t tap in to the antenna. My heart started going, I was checking amplifiers, up-converters, everything and I couldn&#x27;t see anything wrong. After a few minutes the client called panicking because the action should have taken moments, not minutes. After more confirming with the satellite company that I wasn&#x27;t transmitting I checked back through my steps and eventually saw I had missed one crucial thing: when you changed certain parameters it muted the output! A quick few button presses and the patient man on the phone said &quot;there it is!&quot; and I can relax again.<p>Lessons learnt:\n1) I should have noticed a critical LED on the modulator was not lit!\n2) This is the reason change controls say &quot;working period 10 minutes&quot; (time taken 9m50s).\n3) A good boss will defend you if you recognise your mistakes and don&#x27;t f*ck up too badly.\n4) Don&#x27;t go for a quick drink with your brother before a night shift.<p>In the broadcast industry they say you aren&#x27;t a real engineer until you&#x27;ve taken a TV network off air.

Grabbing two of them, he called the staff out to the alley behind the restaurant where the garbage was held. He hurled the oil at the side of the building, smashing the glass bottles against the wall. “It’s full of chemicals,” he screamed at his confused and frightened staff members, who scrambled back to the kitchen through the gathering scent of truffle oil mingled with the fetid air of the alley. “No more!”\n>\n> I couldn’t have said it better myself.",1391286420

Essentially, as you construct objects and add/remove keys, you back them in the engine with more-efficient shared objects that have the same structure.  Add a key D and it moves from <shared structure with A,B,C> to <shared structure with A,B,C,D>.  Since most code ends up doing the same kind of operations on a bunch of similar bits of data, you can save a lot of compute-time by assuming that and having a slower fallback when it fails (like using an actual dictionary instead of a Struct-like thing).<p>That said, Javascript has zero enforcement for this, and the runtimes may have already shifted to something different.

The thing is a lot of it won&#x27;t need to change majorly.<p>Maps should be a replacement of data structures like dicts and gb_trees, but I personally do not see them as a replacement of records within a module, where I feel their restrictiveness is welcome, for two main reasons:<p>1. especially to crash early in live code upgrades, despite, I&#x27;m sure, a lot of people disagreeing with me.<p>2. The module isolation inherent to records makes people think at a protocol level and with their API much, much better than the common pattern of saying &quot;screw it&quot;, sharing the state around, and breaking abstraction all over. I like how it constrains the programmer to think of what should be passed around in messages, and that maps may remove that &quot;think hard&quot; part of the problem.<p>Maps should be especially nice and enable more complex dictionary manipulations, nested key/val mapping, and so on, and in terseness of operations. More elegantly, they could be a decent fix to &#x27;use ETS to optimize K/V operations&#x27;, although they won&#x27;t benefit from the same parallel access.<p>I plan to explain this and possibly revisit some code snippets from the book in an add-on chapter, and also show what I wouldn&#x27;t change.<p>Regarding Funs, I probably will just add a section to the anonymous function part, and see if I ever used recursive anoynmous functions before.

7163124,comment,7161417,7161918,1,0,ZeppelinDePlomo,,,"&quot;Argentine government is especially bizarre because the party system has historially not made any damn sense at all.&quot;<p>Argentine here. That&#x27;s just not true, at all.<p>First, &quot;Peronism&quot; is not a party. &quot;Peronism&quot; is the product of the deep personalism of argentine politics. It&#x27;s movement very much like a political Christianity: &quot;he tougth us The Way and we must interpret his words&quot;. It&#x27;s like if people in the US that love Ronald Regan started calling his thinking something like &quot;Reganism&quot;.<p>As you pointed out, Republican and Democrats changed their general views over time. The same happens here. The difference is that the Justicialist party (the main &quot;Peronist&quot; party) almost <i>always</i> wins.<p>Traditionally, the analog to the current Democrat/Republican dynamic was the Justicialist/Radical Civic Union (or &quot;UCR&quot;). The first one was more for economic regulation and general welfare, while the second was less about welfare and more about economic freedom. But the UCR hadn&#x27;t been relevant for almost 20 years now. In the &#x27;90s the Justicialist party took a &quot;economic liberal&quot; turn, a strange one in retrospect, but one that most Justicialists supported because &quot;privatization of public services and more economic freedom, for some specific people, CAN be better for the welfare of the people&quot;. How can a left-wing party get away with that? they had power. They already had the left-wing peronists masses, and they could get the votes of the middle-class, who mainly voted for the UCR, with some economically liberal policies. The left/right dynamic was destroyed because one party got to powerful.<p>That ended badly, with horrible preformance by a heavly subsidized private sector, the inability to compete with foreign products destroyed hole industries, the massive firings created more and more poverty and slums, and a monetary policy that tried to maintain the Argentine peso equivalent to the US dollar without actually creating enough growth to sustain it. Things were starting to smell around &#x27;99, so the Justicialist party lost the presidential election against an alliance spear-headed by the UCR. But then everything went south in 2001. We had one of the worst economic crisis in our history, the goverment authorized the banks to not give any money back to the people, which created a massive outcry from the middle-class. After that any reasonable person would ask &quot;And why the fuck would anybody vote for the Justicialist Party ever again?&quot;, and that&#x27;s when Faith comes in. Faith, and the lack of options (after all, the crisis exploded during the UCR-and-friends&#x27;s watch). People still believed that &quot;Peronism&quot; was the true path, so the Justicialist Party reinvent themselves.<p>A small faction within the party rose to power with a &quot;go back to the roots&quot; narrative. And they did, they won the 2003 presidential election under the name &quot;Front for Victory&quot;, registered as a &quot;new party&quot;. The failure of the &quot;Neoliberal model&quot;, the model their own party had apply, gave them the perfect traumatized population to apply a left-wing, demagoge, and nationalist narrative. And because we like our personalization in our politics, we call it &quot;Kirchnerism&quot;, for the faction&#x27;s leader Nestor Kirchner (president of the country for two terms). He died in 2010. The current president, Cristina Kirchner, was his wife...<p>And that&#x27;s it. We had classical rigth/wing dynamic until the left-wing party got so powerful that could do whatever they wanted, and failing miserably trying to keep everybody happy. They gave sinking ship to the traditionally right-wing party, and when shit hit the fan they lose their last chance to prove the people they were capable, dooming them for ever. Then, the left-wing party went trougth a rebranding process and started ruling again, without any real oponents, with all the political power. Just now we have some contenders for The New Rigth Wing Party (UCR is pretty much dead now), but only time will tell.<p>Oh, and of course now we have a new generation of kid rised in the &#x27;00s inside the goverment-funded propaganda machine, kids that wear T-Shirts that say &quot;With Cristina, Without Doubts&quot;... yeah.",1391284811

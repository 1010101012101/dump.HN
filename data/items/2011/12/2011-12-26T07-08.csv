A system whereby edit/action buttons appear only when the mouse is on the right hand side of the screen seems reasonable -- if users have trained themselves to expect this behaviour and UIs consistently use this pattern in predictable ways.<p>If every user interface with mouse input used a ""hover the cursor to the right of the screen for edit/action buttons"" pattern, it'd become quite natural to users.<p>Gnome 3 is a good example of where hidden elements are used successfully. Hovering the mouse in the top left ""Activities"" corner of the screen will show hidden content. The bottom right corner of the screen also shows hidden content (this time, without any visual affordance). Users learn to expect the hidden items to appear when hovering the cursor. No affordance is required. The downside is that users may not be able to discover this behaviour without help from a tutorial or manual (at least until ""hot corners"" become a standard UI pattern).",1324886246

Confusion about how something works is definitely not the user’s problem, it’s the developer’s.)<p>The navigation bar only disappears automatically after you selected a book in your library. It is displayed for a few seconds to show that there are controls. After it disappeared you can make it appear by taping anywhere. It works analogous to the video player.<p>So it’s consistent with other navigation controls that don’t have to and probably shouldn’t be displayed all the time.<p>Once you tap the text to make the navigation bar show up it won’t disappear automatically – ever – at least as long as you are reading the same book and don’t go back to your library, no matter where you switch to.<p>One of the problems with the current behavior is that anywhere doesn’t really mean anywhere inside iBooks. The left and right margins are reserved for turning the page. That can frustrate users who want to make the controls appear. If they tap the wrong place they turn the page instead of making the controls appear. There is no obvious demarcation about safe places to tap. Making the controls disappear when playing a video works better because users really can tap anywhere. There are no unsafe spots.<p>Here is how I would change it: I would just not hide it by default. Users would still be able to hide it by taping on the text.",1324884433

I'd also add disabling the root user, installing a software firewall like ufw, and invest in an SSL cert (they're not that expensive compared to the losses you could incur should some ass decide to attack your server).  Thanks for this. Merry Christmas.",1324882889

You are way too aggressive with me.<p>University researchers have many consensus, scientifically based viewpoints on how to improve social issues. The simple fact is that the research is just ignored in favor of radical emotionally-potent ideologies.<p>Many political ideas have been scientifically tested. I spent years in university learning about them and I certainly don't know them all, but I know professors who have worked on these issues for decades and have been able to draw strong scientific conclusions.<p>Economists throughout the world are able to reach consensus (defined as 90%+ agreement) on many issues. Their consensus is ignored politically.<p>Psychologists are able to reach consensus on certain questions of public mental health and the mental health of the poor. Their conclusions are politically ignored.<p>This is the pattern. The pattern is that other countries have demonstrated social success stories and other countries have put the University social science into practice and reaped success. The USA does not. American political policy is a combination of Christian fascist social policy, corrupt Democratic/Republican fake social program pork barrel, and Military-Industrial-Security complex pork barrel.<p>People with reasonable views based on consensus science are underrepresented.<p>If you actually think you can ""demolish all my arguments"" then you've lost my respect for your lack of humility. You're just one man, you don't have time to be an expert in every field.<p>My opinions are mostly informed by the consensus views of social scientists. When implemented, social science has been very successful.<p>What do I want to do about the poor? I just want scientifically literate people to put more time into politics so that they can counteract the voices of irrationality that currently dominate lawmaking.<p>I want smart people to act on the good science that is out there instead of having the wealthy and intelligent throw up their hands and pretend it is someone else's problem.",1324882817

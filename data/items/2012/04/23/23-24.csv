3881669,comment,3878661,3880404,1,0,Arelius,,,"The problem is this begins to break down when you want to do more complicated things, A small gripe that still illustrates the point:<p>> be as fast as typing ""| bill 10.00"" where ""bill"" takes an email address on standard input.<p>What happens then when ""bill"" takes and email address on stdin but I need it to take an amount on stdin and an email address on the command line. This is the sort of thing that unix starts to break down on, you spend far too much time trying to munge the data into the delicate format that various programs expect it on.<p>Secondly you say:\n> No matter how productive -- HOW PRODUCTIVE! - you are at writing a script to bill a user ten dollars, you can never -- NEVER! -- be as fast as typing ""| bill 10.00"" where ""bill"" takes an email address on standard input. That Unix program does not exist.<p>But have little evidence to back that up, and with a little inspection it seems that that holds very little grounds against something such as ""bill(10.00, email)"" as one would do in a modern environment.<p>If you want to know why you are being downvoted, it's because you have remarkable claims (10000x improvement is <i>very</i> remarkable) with little to zero evidence to back those claims up.",1335225518

3881637,comment,3880935,3880935,15,0,zred,,,"Assuming earnings of $205M per quarter and a valuation of $100B, that would put Facebook's P/E ratio at 122.  Today, Apple is at 16.3, Google at 18.1, Netflix at 24.4, and Microsoft at 11.7.  Now, it's completely possible that Facebook's <i>earnings</i> growth will outstrip those more established companies.  However, it does show that one has to think Facebook will grow its earnings at a considerably faster rate than those companies to be a good value at a $100B valuation.<p>Myself, I don't see Facebook necessarily going the way of AOL and MySpace.  Facebook's engineering chops are a lot better.  Sure, there's an amount of social lock-in that they shared with AOL and MySpace, but that isn't the only thing keeping Facebook on top right now.  Facebook has made sure that their site runs well - a minimum of errors, predictable and decently speedy response, and a willingness to address technological challenges that keep the site humming.  While we might lambaste Facebook a bit from a social perspective, they've open sourced some genuinely good tools and seem to be sticking to their technological guns.  Unlike MySpace, AOL, and Yahoo, Facebook isn't morphing into a company where ""media"" types run the show.  While the social aspect is very important for Facebook, I think there's a more engineering-centric or engineering-friendly culture that will persist there like it has at Google.  I don't see the higher-ups at Facebook thinking ""oh, I get the cool stuff the kids today are hip to and I just need some peon programmer to translate my awesomeness into computer speak.  All programmers are interchangeable cogs, right?""  I think that does speak to Facebook's longevity.  In technology, you need to be able to improve your product, not just keep the lights on.<p>However, Facebook relies on non-technological factors more than Google or Apple.  Facebook needs to remain the place people sign up when they join a social network.  It isn't too hard to imagine Facebook becoming the place known as the hangout for people's parents.  As someone in my twenties, I'll probably have teenagers in 15-25 years (a decent number of my friends will in 15 years).  Will they want to be on the social network that I'm on - the social network of my generation?  It's already weird to me when old people sign up for Facebook.  I don't want to ""friend"" my actual friends' parents.  Frankly, I'm a (slightly) different person when I'm talking to my friends and when I'm talking to my friends' parents.  Likewise, Facebook is treading a thin line on sharing.  In the early days, Facebook was very closed and putting something on Facebook felt more private.  Facebook has been slowly changing that to the point that I wonder whether I should just edit myself a bit more and publish publicly rather than on FB in a more formal way (ie. a blog).  Finally, people could just get tired of it.  I'm finding less interesting things in my newsfeed as time goes on.  I find that I don't feel like posting as much.<p>For me, Facebook's valuation at $100B seems high given its earnings.  It's PE ratio is above 100 and so one has to assume much more growth than other very good companies.  It might happen.  However, I think Facebook faces a decent amount of uncertainty in its future.  It's well-engineered and well-run compared to those who have failed that we might point to as Facebook's future, but with a social product there's more than just having good service and any number of things could hurt Facebook from privacy concerns to becoming the network of the people who went to college from 2000-2015 while younger folk find a different place to digitally hang out.  I wouldn't compare them to AOL, Yahoo, or MySpace, but I'd still say Facebook's valuation is quite high.",1335224756

They flow through the cycle of CUE->ROUTINE->REWARD->CRAVE. Everything starts with a CUE, which triggers the habit. It could be something as simple as the little red indicator on your iphone app. This is followed by ROUTINE - or the series of actions that we normally think of as a habit. Next is the REWARD which can be surprising at times - you might think you get that cookie after lunch to enjoy the sugar rush, but in reality you might just enjoy talking to coworkers in the cafeteria. Lastly, for any habit to stick, you must CRAVE the reward at the end.<p>The book goes in more depth about how to use this cycle to structure habits in your own life (I have FINALLY started to workout and wake up early since reading the book). It also has great case studies about how advertisers, product managers, people managers, and more are structure these habits to influence consumers, employees, etc",1335224068

I hope it's only that my comment seemed that way because we're coming from very different perspectives.<p>By ""more like Java"" I just meant adding classes at all. I'm uninterested in that way of programming - not out of ignorance, I did it for years and I think it's a gigantic cargo cult. That JS somehow escaped it is, in my view, a small miracle. That we have JS at all is a miracle. For all its flaws, it's a small, hackable, dynamic language that retained enough magic from its Lisp/Self inspirations to spawn a new galaxy of creativity. I don't believe that if it had been done more ""properly"" we'd be better off today. Great inventions often live on the improper side of the proper/improper divide. JS succeeded on the web while its ""proper"" cousin, the one designed for ""programming in the large"", the one organized around ""good"" practices (including classes), failed. I think that fact is deep and mysterious and the most important thing is not to mess with it.<p>So while you say it's clear that you'd be doing no harm, that's far from clear to me. I read the links you provided and still think that.<p>But I acknowledge there are degrees here, and if you're mostly trying to prevent JS from turning into Java, thanks.

On big, wide displays it's indeed a good way to do it. On small displays (notebooks) docking on the bottom is better. If you have multiple displays, detaching and moving the detached window to the other display works best. I think it's a good idea to assume the worst (tiny display) and dock to the bottom; the browser will remember your setting anyway so it's not like you'll need to do this all the time.",1335223596

However, to me this point is undermined by the description of writing a procedure near the end:<p>>  If you are good at abstracting, youll likely come up with three different scenarios for breaking a line. 1. you break it at the 10th character of a word if that word is longer than 10 characters. 2. You break it at the 11th character if that character is a space. 3. You look backwards from the 10th character looking for a space and if there is one, you break it there.<p>I think it is less valuable to break down your procedure into smaller pieces before given an estimate, and more valuable to have a good knowledge of what sorts of problems are hard and why they're hard. That way, you don't have to resort to glib phrases like ""Write down a procedure to tie your shoes"".",1335222350

Hell every time i finish a module or feature on my current project i am always like ... What the hell ... It actually works. I do this because i remember not 5hrs or a day ago, i had no freaking idea what i was doing, the VIM screen was empty and had no idea where to start or how to solve what i wanted to do (specially if its a new language, new team or new technology your working with). Team always tells me to sit down and get back to work (jokingly) after i joyously get up and do fist pumps but i get happy when i have no experience in something but manage to stumble over things until i get it to work, cause the joy is not simply the thing works, its that i feel having no experience and getting something working no matter what the topic of concern is, is a big deal, whether its programming, math or traveling the world by your self when you have never left the house. It is a big deal ...<p>Right now though, i am working on a startup, just small, making some revenue to live of but finding it tough, very very tough, competition is aplenty, constant new technical problems ,design choices, no idea how to market cause just no experience (so far its been organic but we need a faster rate of growth)and i can honestly say this feels like it could be a particular case where i might not be able to make it out with a smile on my face. In all the other problems i had no experience with, i got this voice in my head that says, mate... you will do this no problems, you will get the problem solved but for this startup the voice is there but just not as strong cause its been told to shutup in more then one instance when things didn't turn out as planned. However, since I know in the past when i kept going things turned out alright I just keep going.<p>For a startup, there are just so many fronts that need some experience and as far as i can think back , I only ever had to face a single topic at a time for which I didn't have experience. Some examples have been when I worked on new math or programming problem or studying for any exam, solving a problem at work that is more inter personal, asking for a raise when i had never asked for one before, its all just one thing so its easier to focus all the attention on how to make that single thing work. But for a startup there are just so many fronts that experience would really help to make the event of starting a startup successful. Its painful sometimes ...<p>I guess this is the first step towards getting more experience :) and hey .. its fun",1335222296
3881455,comment,3880837,3881180,5,0,nkoren,,,"Devanagari (the script which is used to write Hindi and  several other Indic languages[1]) is very similar in this respect. A fairly modest number of consonant characters are combined with vowel indicators (""mudras""), which are then augmented with various diacritical flourishes to indicate non-plosive quasi-consonant sounds (what do you actually call those?) such as trailing ""R""s and ""N""s, vowel nasalisations, etc. Just to make life interesting, consonants can be conjoined to indicate glides between them. There are 1,296 possible permutations of conjoins, and when you consider all the possible permutations of vowel mudras and diacriticals, the glyph library can get a bit crazy. Not dissimilar from Hangul, except that the Indic languages have vastly more phonemes than Korean does.<p>Having picked up Hindi/Devanagari more or less by osmosis, I find that this profusion of glyphs means that my brain processes them differently than it does other alphabets (I also read Cyrillic and the Japanese Kanas). The various strokes seem to take on a ""feeling"" of associated pronunciation that is both intuitive and very, very precise (since every possible aspect of pronunciation is captured by the script). So when I run across bizarrely conjoined characters (like this[2]), I immediately have an intuitive and generally accurate sense of what sound they ought to produce, even if it takes me quite a while to puzzle out exactly <i>why</i>. This is almost the exact opposite of English, for example, where figuring out the characters is the easy part, while figuring out the sound they create is sometimes impossible.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/JanaSanskritSans_ddhrya.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/JanaSansk...</a>",1335222282

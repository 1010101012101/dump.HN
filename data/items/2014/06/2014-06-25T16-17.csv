The most effective way of doing that is to just pay the poor people off while they start organizing greater and greater things.</i>&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not how the psychology of power works, either. Or wealth. (You&#x27;re not &quot;rich&quot;, you are &quot;richer than someone else&quot;---wealth is only a goal when it is relative.) The rich don&#x27;t have power unless there are poor handy to make do stuff. And historically, &quot;just pay the poor people off&quot; is the <i>last</i> option that anyone tries. Consider the French revolution and the 19th and 20th century class wars that resulted in the 40-hour workweek and unionization. (Hiring mercenaries to break strikes is cheaper than paying off poor people.) What&#x27;s your opinion of unionization? Satisfactory way of balancing economic inequality issues, or economic atherosclerosis?<p>&quot;<i>The real thing I&#x27;m worried about is actually hard AI.</i>&quot;<p>Actually, that&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;m not particularly concerned about; I am familiar with computational complexity.<p>&quot;<i>backed on land taxes, ideally</i>&quot;<p>That is a <i>brilliant</i> idea!

So then why aren&#x27;t people seeing it? Because the economy is not a magical meritocracy. It is run by people; people who don&#x27;t necessary feel all warm and fuzzy about sharing wealth. Every avenue of trade has gatekeepers encouraged to limit access. Collusion between businesses and corruption in government keep working wages artificially low, and taxes on the poor disproportionally high. Reality and history take issue with your casual assumption that the rich would find it easy to give poor people free money.<p>The critical flaw in your position is this: Any increase in personal productivity is meaningless as long as those in power can take as much as they want from whomever they want.

The whole point is that a robot is going to be so much more efficient than a human, that for less than 1/50th the cost of a median house a human could buy a robot that could create enough economic production for his whole life.<p>> There will be challenges, since many people live paycheque to paycheque, but ultimately a very simple Basic Income (backed on land taxes, ideally) would catch those that would fall in the cracks<p>1) If they live paycheck to paycheck, they aren&#x27;t going to have the financial resources to drop $6k on a robot. Even the boldest &quot;Basic Income&quot; proponents don&#x27;t expect to provide more than basic sustenance to survive. Political realities are in line with that being the level of funding it would provide people.<p>1b) If basic uneducated labor is valueless due to being replaced with robots, many of those people who live paycheck to paycheck are going to move down to being on the dole and can&#x27;t afford robots as well. Some people will be too old to have the desire to re-learn, some won&#x27;t have the ability, etc.<p>2) Land taxes are simultaneously a tax on renters as well as owners since they aren&#x27;t based on your ability to pay [profitability]. That means they&#x27;ll be passed on to renters wholesale who in turn will need a higher amount of basic income to support it.<p>3) Basic Income has to be funded sustainable in a way that doesn&#x27;t result in it eating its own tail. That probably will be income taxes on capital + payroll which will cause everyone to scream pretty loudly.<p>I don&#x27;t see your utopia working with those assumptions.",1403715291

7945151,comment,7943976,7944247,7,0,bradleyjg,,,"> To me, it seems like the Court is hung up on how similar the end result is to the cable providers&#x27;, even though the means are different.<p>Not just the modern cable providers, the historical CATV analogy is much tighter. The original cable entrepreneurs served valley communities that couldn&#x27;t get OTA signals. They put up giant antennas at the top of the valley and cables from there to individual houses below. The broadcast television industry tried to destroy those companies using very similar arguments as in this case, and the Supreme Court sided with the CATV companies (Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 \nU. S. 390 (1968) and Teleprompter \nCorp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U. S. 394 (1974))<p>But those decisions were a matter of statutory interpretation, not constitutional law. Such decisions are always subject to be overruled by Congress, and that&#x27;s exactly what happened in 1976 with the The Copyright Act of 1976. In passing that law, Congress  specifically intended to overrule the earlier Supreme Court cases. Aereo&#x27;s technology might be slightly different, but if you can&#x27;t run a passive cable from an antenna to a subscriber&#x27;s house which is perhaps the most straightforward possible arrangement, it&#x27;s hard to see how anything along these lines is going to pass muster.<p>It&#x27;s easy enough to blame the Supreme Court and accuse them of not understanding technology, but it is Congress that specifically went out of its way to advantage broadcast companies in this way. The fault and solution lies there.",1403714888

7945083,comment,7943964,7943964,66,0,grellas,,,"The Copyright Act is a federal statute that protects any public performance of a copyrighted work from infringing uses.<p>Aereo took what were undisputedly public performances of works from broadcasters to the public, intercepted them, and by a feat of what amounted to technological legerdemain turned them into what it argued were no longer public performances but, instead, individualized transmissions from its service to each of its end users as an audience of one.<p>In this case, the Supreme Court rejected that argument, relying heavily on the idea that it was merely interpreting a statute (the Copyright Act) that had been amended by Congress in 1976 in part to overturn a couple of Supreme Court cases that had interpreted the prior Act to permit cable-TV style transmissions of copyrighted material free of copyright restrictions. The Court held that, in doing so, Congress intended to bring cable-like services such as Aereo into the Act&#x27;s sweep regardless of the particular technological ways in which it handled the copyrighted material as it re-transmitted it to its users. Treating such technology, in effect, like a black box, the Court emphasized that, regardless of its innards, this service appeared to all concerned - to broadcasters, to viewers, etc. - to be functioning just like a cable service and therefore fell squarely within the Act&#x27;s coverage as Congress had intended to modify it in making the 1976 amendments.<p>The most fascinating part of the decision, in my view, was how the Court arrived at this result while simultaneously trying to narrow its impact so that modern technological innovations would not be hit by its shrapnel. The Court not only did so but did so <i>emphatically</i>. Indeed, it devoted an entire section IV (pages 15-17) of its opinion to that issue. &quot;We agree&quot;, said the Court, &quot;that Congress, while intending the Transmit Clause to apply broadly to cable companies and their equivalents [i.e., Aereo], did not intend to discourage or control the emergence or use of different kinds of technologies.&quot; The Court then goes on to suggest (without deciding) a number of potentially key distinctions by which things such as, e.g., cloud music services might not in any way be infringing, including the prospect of fair use or the fact that the user receiving a transmission from the service may already own the copyrighted works being transmitted. I believe this is a strong signal from the Court that lower courts are not to ham-handedly interpret copyright law to stifle innovation but are to apply it carefully to prevent its abuse.<p>All in all, this decision represents a guarded upholding of traditional IP protections that prevents the use of technology to enable free-wheeling use of broadcasted materials while at the same time limiting its holding to that narrow sphere. Given the technical wording of the Act, it could just as easily have gone the other way and upheld the Aereo service as nothing more than something that facilitates individual, &quot;private&quot; performances via a streaming technology. But that would certainly have glorified form over substance and, I think, the Court got it right in the end.",1403714353

The original &quot;C With Classes&quot; wasn&#x27;t much more than a convenient syntactic sugar for using structs and function pointers as a poor man&#x27;s object system, something that was and is common in large, abstract C programs (e.g. Linux&#x27;s VFS layer, Gtk+).<p>I think you may be confusing is with ought here. Everybody sane knows C++ has flaws; I think Meyers even feels this way in his presentation. C++ is popular because it evolved and thus contains a lot of compromises.

It took 10 years to fix cell phone searches, and only after millions of dollars worth of concerted advocacy by EFF, ACLU, etc. And it might have gone the other way: remember the courts have blessed the erosion of Fourth Amendment protections because of the War On Some Politically Unpopular Drugs.<p>Option #3, creating technology, works as soon as you can deploy it, and is subject to the laws of mathematics rather than whether a SCOTUS justice is a crankypants today when it comes to privacy. Of course the NSA may try to subvert your encryption/anonymizer/etc., but its attempts may fail, and, besides, intelligence agencies already subverted Congress long ago. :)",1403713902

I have some clarification of what may be going on here.<p>Cable headends tend not to have very much compression equipment, sometimes they have stuff used for feeds local to the headend, but usually the compression happens at the originating facility.  For something like CNN, this is at their studio.  The signal with that original compression is encrypted, uplinked to the satellite and then received off the satellite by receivers at the headend.  It comes out of that receiver as a compressed digital signal called ASI, which is MPEG2 compressed video over SDI.  It is then typically fed into a demultiplexer/multiplexer that will combine or separate it into different streams and then it is fed into a QAM modulator.  For ATSC the same is fed into a 8vsb modulator (or something like that).  For encrypted systems it is fed into a encryption unit before being fed into the QAM modulator.  The key here is that each video stream is not recompressed even when it is remultiplexed.<p>The issue may be that of signal strengths and associated error rates and how that is reflected in encrypted streams.  Typically encryption cases degradation to be reflected poorly in the signal compared to unencrypted signals.",1403713505

Each consumer has no more than 24 hours in a day to devote their undivided attention to something.<p>Studios are in a competitive environment.  Not only do they have to fight other current studios for monetizable customers, they have to compete with the entire corpus of existing works.  Fringe has to compete with X-Files.  Law and Order: New Episode has to compete with Law and Order: Rerun.<p>In order to make money from customers, there must be an intact distribution path between supplier and consumer.  In the world of physical goods, you cannot sell a Chinese widget to Joe Merica without a cargo ship, a stacktrain, an intermodal truck, a big-box store, its parking lot, and the roads between it and Joe&#x27;s house or business.  All that has to be paid for.  It is completely unreasonable for the overseas manufacturer to expect that he be paid by all those links in the supply chain for the privilege of carrying the goods.<p>The manufacturer has to pay them a portion of what he earns from Joe on the sale, because without them, he cannot get Joe&#x27;s money at all.  The transport network provides value to the manufacturer because it increases the potential size of his market.  Likewise, the manufacturer provides value to the transport network by giving it something to move.  Neither one can even try take the whole pie, or it ceases to exist.<p>The distributor has to pay the supplier.  <i>But the supplier also has to pay the distributor.</i><p>In the case of broadcast television, the problem of who pays whom is partially resolved by advertising.  Advertisers pay the supplier for access to their customers&#x27; attention, and the supplier can therefore pay distributors in proportion to the number of customers they can provide.<p>This is why broadcasters pay so much for licenses.  Over-the-air radio broadcasts can bring in a huge number of customers with relatively low infrastructure investment.  As long as they are paid by advertisers on a per-viewer basis, there is no reason why they should be getting any additional money from anybody for rebroadcasting rights... except one.<p>If the rebroadcaster is not providing the same number of consumers for the advertisers as for the entertainment content, the supplier is not getting paid for them.  Enter the commercial-skipping DVR.  The advertising model breaks down.  The advertisers have to assume that every person not watching a show live is skipping their ads, so they only pay for the live audience.<p>And so castles made of sand fall in the sea eventually.<p>If any necessary part of the supply chain is not paid for, the money dries up for everyone.  And the advertisers are paid with statistics.  Aereo probably could have made this go away simply by offering up timestamps and button presses, to identify the number of customers actually watching the ads.",1403712962

It might justify a particular application of the law, but it isn&#x27;t the law. It is what lawyers call &quot;dicta.&quot;<p>NSA wiretaps differ in two key ways:<p>1) At least in theory, they are intended to capture foreign communications. People not on U.S. soil who are not U.S. citizens enjoy no protections under our Constitution.<p>2) This case is based on interpreting the &quot;search incident to arrest&quot; exception to the 4th amendment&#x27;s warrant requirement. The essence of the exception is that while a warrantless search of someone&#x27;s person is potentially the most egregious of fourth amendment violations (&quot;person&quot; being specifically enumerated in the text of the 4th amendment), it is nonetheless reasonable in the context of a search incident to arrest,[1] where it might be necessary in order to secure the arrestee, who might have a gun or throw away evidence.<p>An undersea cable is totally different. It is not a search of anybody&#x27;s &quot;person&quot; but a search of something containing signals that people are transmitting out into the world. There are four specific things enumerated in the 4th amendment: someone&#x27;s house, person, papers, and effects. It is clear how searching a phone in someone&#x27;s pocket is a search both of their person and their effects. But signals transmitted out into the world does not fit neatly into any of those four categories. For example if those signals were transmitted via radio versus fiber optic cable, would it be a &quot;search&quot; to listen in on them?<p>Now, the language of the case is relevant in that it suggests the Court may be open to a more expansive reading of the 4th amendment when it comes to digital data. There is no way the conservatives on the court would favor extraterritorial application of the Constitution with regards to undersea wiretaps, but it could bode well for challenges to domestic surveillance.<p>[1] Incidentally, as the opinion notes, the touchstone of the 4th amendment is &quot;reasonableness.&quot; This fuzzy word is used explicitly in the Constitution to allow judges to engage in line drawing and balancing the interests of law enforcement with privacy rights.",1403712689

Especially if that information is of a highly technical nature. The lack of comprehension is compounded; the more unfamiliar you are with the concepts at hand.<p>One of the things that we do without thinking about it is make associations between things we know and things we don&#x27;t know when reading. This allows us to provide a framework for the words and phrases we don&#x27;t understand using the ones that we do, thus pulling the meaning out of the context. Spritz and by extension Squirt does not allow you to create these links because you don&#x27;t retain the full breadth of the context for each word as you are reading them, and with no built in method for jumping back or forth through the information being presented it fails to allow these bridges to be built, and this lowers comprehension.<p>Now take something like this and implement an interface that tracks the users eye movement via a webcam to allow the flow of words to jump backwards and forwards through the surrounding information might work. But you would have to do some pretty impressive eye tracking and do it all with as little delay as possible to make the flow smooth, no matter what direction it goes. That said jumping back in the information would probably be jarring if the text just starts to flow in reverse. So one would probably have to jump back with some kind of visual cue to a pointer further back in the text and then continue reading forward again.<p>Also I&#x27;d love to see this implemented where it shows a sentence at a time.

We&#x27;re a more intimate program than Dev Bootcamp but share some of their early core principals towards educational diversification.<p>I first met Shereef Bishay in early 2012 after he wisely took an MVP approach to what is now known as Dev Bootcamp via his cousin and a small group of other aspiring developers based on a &#x27;bet&#x27; that he couldn&#x27;t teach them to code in 10-weeks.  Not only did Shereef prove that small group wrong (winning the bet) but he&#x27;s gone on to pioneer an industry that has benefited thousands of people to change their lives for the better through immersive education in software development.<p>These programs are not for everyone however.

The trouble is you want e.g. a protocol to secure your communications, and designing one yourself while making it secure is a huge ordeal, whereas you could just use TLS for free even though it&#x27;s full of warts. So everybody uses TLS. Which then snowballs into everyone using OpenSSL for TLS even though it&#x27;s ancient and full of cruft.<p>The problem is you do want everyone using the well-reviewed long-tested thing, but then that thing becomes a decaying designed-by-committee monstrosity which nobody can fix because it would break compatibility.

But there&#x27;s quite a lot of disagreement about the severity of the problem.  If you look around, there are many old and overweight people.  They got to that point without having the kind of muscle mass you&#x27;re talking about.<p>A more persuasive approach is probably to focus on the benefits, rather than the implied downside of not having &quot;health.&quot;  For example, I had no idea that exercise would have such a profound effect on my brain.

There are strong links between the intelligence community and the drug &quot;counterculture&quot;, including evidence that the government has actively promoted psychedelic drugs as a means of controlling the population. This should raise concerns. Some salient points:<p>The CIA was testing LSD as a mind control drug under the MKULTRA program in the sixties and seventies. [1]<p>Gordon Wasson, who was VP of Public Relations at JP Morgan and had close ties to Allen Dulles (head of CIA), introduced Americans to magic mushrooms in 1957 on the cover of Life magazine, a JP Morgan company. This effectively kicked off the psychedelic movement in the US. [2]<p>Terrance McKenna, an evangelist for psychedelics and the &quot;archaic revival&quot;, admitted to being a &quot;bard&quot; and working for the FBI as a background agent. [3]<p>These points barely scratch the surface, but there does appear to be a concerted effort to promote psychedelics as a spiritual rite of passage or initiation, into a New Age religion of sorts. Similar to how the Eleusinian Mysteries in Greece ushered in the Greek Dark Age, it is likely that the Psychedelic Revolution will be used to usher in another dark age, as a way to get people to accept a new form of feudalism and totalitarian state control.<p>Just something to think about the next time you drop some acid. Are you really having a &quot;god manifesting&quot; spiritual experience, or being taken on a carnival ride of socially engineered mythology?<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.gnosticmedia.com/public-notice-appeal-to-the-cia-regarding-classification-of-r-gordon-wasson-documents-related-mkultra-subproject-58/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnosticmedia.com/public-notice-appeal-to-the-cia-...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj1yFZRmFsw#t=15753"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj1yFZRmFsw#t=15753</a>",1418594011

8749680,comment,8747935,8747935,0,0,whoopdedo,,,"I tend to look at drug prohibitions by governments as akin to kosher restrictions. I once heard a rabbi explain why kosher exists. (These are his words, recalled from my memory so certainly not exactly correct.) There is no inherent meaning to the prohibition. Not eating pork doesn&#x27;t make you a better person, nor does eating it make you a bad person. But by not eating pork you are demonstrating your obedience to God. The law says &quot;do not kill&quot; and for most men it is easy to obey that law. If that was all one needed to do to be a servant of God there would be little point to religion. Your personal faith would rarely be tested. So God tests us in a small way, with kosher laws. These are easy to obey, but also more difficult because the temptation is more common. When you abstain from eating pork you are strengthening your faith and preparing for when you may be faced with a more serious temptation. It is a daily affirmation of your obedience to God.\n(end quotation)<p>So I also think that government prohibitions exist largely to allow governments to assert their authority. If you can&#x27;t be trusted to follow a simple law like &quot;don&#x27;t use this recreational drug&quot; then you can&#x27;t be trusted to follow more serious laws like &quot;don&#x27;t stab someone in the face&quot;.<p>(Not saying I agree with it.

The Government is content with passing draconian bills penalising users for downloading Game of Thrones and cutting off their Internet connections, sending Swat teams to their homes and allowing corporations to financially haemorrhage them in the &quot;court of law&quot;. Yet, when the Government wants to use someone else&#x27;s music without paying for a licence, they think they are above the law they want to so desperately put in place?<p>They definitely have a case.

Particular effects may be useful, and the others we call &quot;side-effects&quot;.  The problem with drugs is determining these characteristics, a notably difficult task since individual responses vary widely.  BTW, the US FDA considers AE occurrence of >=1% to be &quot;frequent&quot;, that is, a major/signficant side-effect of the drug.<p>Systematic study is extremely laborious.  That&#x27;s the reason therapeutic drugs require such expensive and time-consuming development.  Potential severe but rare effects may not come to the fore until millions of people are exposed to the drug.  If it comes to light that >=1/10^6 recipients have a fatal response, that may represent too big a risk to leave the drug on the market.<p>Hallucinogenic drugs are <i>not</i> risk free.  Spend a few days in the ED where such drugs are being widely used and there will be multiple instances of panic, dissociative responses and psychosis.  This is something I&#x27;ve personally observed.  Yes, it&#x27;s anecdotal, but large, well-structured, placebo-controlled trials have not yet been done.<p>In the absence of such studies, is it ethical to assert the use of any drug is &quot;safe&quot;?

People who took psychedelics behaved in an unexpected and unpredictable fashion. When it was a few Native Americans and University researchers, no big deal. When it became a large percentage of America&#x27;s young people dressing up funny and doing weird things (i.e. anti-social from the perspective at the time)... well, that&#x27;s a different matter and steps _had_ to be taken! Western civilization hates and fears the unknown.<p>So as usual with these types of things (terrorism, communism etc). everything got all blown out of proportion and the person who screamed &quot;Fire&quot; the loudest got the most air time while anyone who dissented was highly suspect and had trouble staying employed. You know, the usual nonsense that seems to repeat throughout history.<p>There probably was a (very small) seed of reality at the base of the hysteria. Twisting everything around can on occasion produce undesired side effects along with whatever benefits are claimed. The idea of drugs for extra powers of perception is not new. Psychedelics have been used for thousands of years. While I am in full agreement that they may on occasion lead to individual realizations which can be useful, if psychedelics were a magic answer for creative thinking, then it would have been a tribe of jungle natives sailing over to greet the linear thinking palefaces rather than the other way around....<p>Should psychedelics be legal? To that I answer... what are laws when time and space are expanding? (real answer... I don&#x27;t know. I guess I don&#x27;t care either.

The cards would be great a obvious benchmark style tasks, but when I recorded the block access pattern from our driver and replayed that on a Linux desktop with O_DIRECT, we&#x27;d not only get under 200KiB/s average access speed (which matched what we were seeing on the embedded system), but we would also get corrupted sectors (ie. we write it just fine, but we just get an error back from the card when we go to read the sector) in less than a day of sustained writes (once again at only 200KiB/s).  And this was with high quality SanDisk cards that were then verified by them to be real cards (for a while we thought that clones had made their way into our supply chain).

Psychedelics are great for helping people with anxiety, stress/tension and helping them remove dependence on medication, alcohol and so on (my experience) as it helps you step outside the square and play the whole &quot;mind over matter&quot; thing. That being said, if you&#x27;re an anxious person, there&#x27;s a chance that being on a &quot;trip&quot; would make you even more so. That wasn&#x27;t the case for me.

All you really need to be able to do is allow the user to specify in/out/err streams, so that they could be anything: a log file, a socket, a Python function, etc. So maybe keep a var for each of these and redirect the echos to them?",1418591054

These are the &quot;jump out the window&quot; drugs. They can be dangerous in that sense, and also in the sense that they can be used to cause harm to others - for example, as date rape drugs.<p>They are not always hallucinogenic, are not the same thing as psychedelics, and they tend to be extremely unpleasant so they&#x27;re not even particularly popular.<p>If done responsibly, about the worst thing that a person on LSD will do (assuming no pre-existing mental instability) is lie down, cry, and have a very bad time waiting for the bad trip to be over.

Even if they don't want to keep you, employers are likely to match just to keep you around until your current project is complete.<p>Your best bet in this situation is to simply ask for a raise without mentioning your other offer, and leave if the answer is no.",1272409182
1300082,comment,1299733,1299733,0,0,lliiffee,,,"Technically what is visualized here isn't ""the kernel trick"".  This is the general idea of how nonlinearly projecting some points into a higher-dimensional feature space makes linear classifiers more powerful.  You can do this with out SVMs.  Just compute the high-dimensional features corresponding to your data, then use logistic regression or whatever.  Trouble is, if the higher-dimensional space is really big, this could be expensive.  The ""kernel trick"" is <i>computational</i> trick that SVMs use to compute the inner product between the high-dimensional features corresponding to two points with out explicitly computing the high-dimensional features.  (For certain special feature spaces.)<p>But this is definitely a cool visualization of the value of feature spaces!",1272409081

1300076,comment,1296802,1299937,0,0,MichaelSalib,,,"<i>The fact that American protection of the defenseless isn't completely perfect doesn't mean we don't care about it as a society.</i><p>I don't think this a reasonable way to analyse societal priorities. Obviously, all human societies are going to place some value on protecting the defenceless. I mean, can you think of any human society that placed no value whatsoever on protecting the defenceless? So if that's the metric you're going to judge on, then no society can ever fail. As a result, this strikes me as a pretty useless metric.<p>The original comment used the phrase ""especially high value on protecting the rights of people who cannot defend themselves."" The only reasonable way I know of to assess such statements is to compare America to peer nations that have similar levels of wealth and similar forms of government. I mean, ""especially high"" seems to require a relative comparison. Specifically, one might look at child poverty, child malnourishment, or infant morality. On any of those metrics, the US ranks dead last (or near dead last) when compared with peer nations. That result does not seem to be compatible with the notion that the richest country in the world has a greater concern for the welfare of defenceless children than other western nations. Don't you agree?<p>Look, you can point to my examples and claim that they're special cases, but human organizations demonstrate their values with their budgets. Talk is cheap. Paying for enough CPS staff is not. Well, actually, it is really cheap given the benefits. Underfunded CPS? American society doesn't care all that much about disadvantaged children. Or rather, American society values low marginal tax rates and absolute parental autonomy higher than providing for child protection services. That doesn't mean that American society is bad or evil or that Americans are monsters, but it does mean that you can't justify policies by talking about our unique commitment to protecting defenceless children.",1272408991

It certainly looks like a nice idea, but isn't this arbitrary introduction of non-standard features exactly what we hated IE3-6 for? Prefixing it with ""moz-"" doesn't really make it less propriatory (we can easily have imagined all the IE* 'extensions' having an ie- prefix). If IE9 came out with a load of new CSS selectors and syntax that nobody had heard of, there'd be uproar in large sections of the technorati.<p>This kind of experimentation is certainly useful.

1300041,comment,1297536,1297536,0,0,wglb,,,"The author's point, summarized, is ""Don't recommend books to new programmers that you haven't read yourself"". My recommendation is to go read those books that you recommend.  Even if you read them after you recommend them.<p>Did you ever see that stack overflow post which says in dozens of ways that you can't fully take apart (parse) HTML with regular expressions?  If not, you should.  It is informative and entertaining.<p>Don't you think that if those who attempt to separate HTML with regular expressions had read and understood either of the dragon books that they would even try the task with RE?  I don't.  Once you put something like parsing and code generation in your personal toolbox, you would be surprised at the tasks before you that are a lot less intimidating.<p>I agree with Thomas about TAOCP.  I'll give you a particular example.  Volume 2, ""Seminumerical algorithms"" has a description of how to do long division.  It turns out that we needed to do that when shipping a C compiler for 8086/80286 targets that didn't have an '87.  And there is a reference to it in Coders at Work about that particular rare case that turns up only seldom.<p>Have you read the chapter on random number generation?  How he made up this convoluted procedure to use one number to go to a page in a reference book to pick another number, and eventually ended up with a cycle of numbers that was disasterously small?  It is fun.<p>And having an original edition and the recently issued boxed set, it is fun to see some of the problems change from HM 50 to something else.  For example Fermats Last Theorem.<p>The lesson from that is repeated in people writing and using crypto.  Just ask Tom.<p>While there are downsides to a university education, as often pointed out here on hacker news, the experience take you, if you are willing, to places that you wouldn't have on your own.<p>Similarly, the problem in front of you might not automatically make you run to get the dragon book or the others on the list, perhaps a friend can twist your arm to get you to read it.<p>You don't always know what you need ahead of time.

(The fact that it's straight makes the statistics easy.)<p>But not all data sets can be separated easily with a straight line or plane; sometimes they're best separated with some kind of curve (""non-linearly separable"").  The ""trick"" here is to create a higher-dimensional curved surface -- basically twisting our original space where A and B are -- in such a way that now we can make a straight cut between A and B on the twisted surface.  The way our cut intersects the new curved surface corresponds to the best separating curve in the original space.  (The hard part is picking the mathematical formula or ""kernel"" to create the twisted surface.)<p>So, for example, in the video all of the A points were outside of a particular circle and all of the B points were inside the circle.  We create the curved surface above and copy all of the A and B points over.  This allows us to separate A from B with a straight plane; its intersection with our curved space corresponds to a circle in the original space.<p>See also: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine</a>",1272407006

Yes yes, common sense aside, where is the proof. People on eBay have paid a lot more then they're worth for a lot of things.<p>3) And regardless of whether Gizmodo is guilty or not, let's wait for the judge-jury to decide, it is unclear what the charges against Jason Chen are and why were those not disclosed before his house was raided.<p>4) I think the outcome of this this whole episode could have some really big ramifications, such as defining if professional Bloggers are journalists, or not.",1272405985

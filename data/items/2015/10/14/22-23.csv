In fact, patients with APC mutations often have cancer before their 30s. Yet have been successfully passing on this mutation for generations now.<p>If you do not have defective copies of the above (or a small subset of mutations of other regulatory and proto-oncogenes) then you have no greater chance of developing cancer than the next person, lifestyle and virus exposure factors not withstanding.<p>Now I really don&#x27;t think you have any idea what you&#x27;re talking about because your two points are at odds with each other: you first state that we are living longer, and defects &#x27;will kill older, weaker humans&#x27;. Bullshit. \nYour next point, that cancer rates are higher now than at some indeterminate point in the past, is also bullshit and out of context: if we are living longer, then of course we are going to get cancer. But this has no bearing on our genetic susceptibility to cancer over a certain age. In fact, there are no known genetic mutations that predispose to cancer later in life; all the syndromes predispose to cancer early.<p>I can only suppose you are trolling very hard, and hence hiding behind &#x27;anon1mous&#x27;",1444863343

In the end, Wall street values discounted cash flow. As Bill Gurley has said:<p>> So growth is good, correct? There is a reason to save growth for last. While growth is quite important, and even thought we are in a market where growth is in particularly high demand, growth all by itself can be misleading. Here is the problem. Growth that can never translate into long-term positive cash flow will have a negative impact on a DCF model, not a positive one. This is known as “profitless prosperity.”<p>In other words, as long as you can show sustainable double digit growth, you can afford to value based on growth. If you don&#x27;t and all of the sudden you can&#x27;t maintain a positive DCF, the Street will hit you hard.

Those areas hadn&#x27;t been annexed in to a collective country with a single ruler, just like Gwynedd when it paid fealty to the English crown wasn&#x27;t yet annexed. Alongside that some regions were already in effective possession of the English crown, and some few maybe were neither under Llywellyn&#x27;s nor John&#x27;s boot yet [I&#x27;ve not figured that out quite yet in my research].<p>[...cut for size...]<p>>So, the question is in fact: Wales was once a country, got gobbled up and is slowly regaining some independence. //<p>I think this is a nationalist misdirection. To recapitulate - Deheurbath and Gwynedd always seemed to be at odds, never united in to a common cause or stably under a common leader, nor common rule of law after the Romans, until they both came under the English Crown (just as it was in [the rest of] England). Wales was arguably a country - a single kingdom - for a very brief time but the people of the different kingdoms went their separate ways at the earliest opportunity. These separate kingdoms then got gobbled up, just like the separate Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were gobbled up by Wessex. Unless you consider Kent to have been a country in 1900, say, I can&#x27;t see how you can consider Wales to have been one then either.<p>I think you&#x27;re right that since the WAG was established Wales has had some claim to being a &quot;country&quot; but there seems a stronger claim that it&#x27;s counties, like those of the rest of England are still a part of the country that is the dominion of the English Crown.<p>There has certainly been an effort in the last 80 years or so, since the Council for Wales was created, to make a new country: I&#x27;m certainly happy to go along with the WAG being a strong weight in favour of calling Wales a country.<p>It&#x27;s strange to me that in the UK we had a great Welsh ruler of an historic Welsh line who ruled over all over England [aka &quot;England and Wales&quot;] as a unit, yet many in Wales instead want to look back to the time when the Wales was critically divided between two great powers and when it was most common for <i>Cymry</i> to be killing one another; a brief period that ended with Welsh killing their &quot;own&quot; king [Gruffydd ap Llewellyn].<p>It strikes me that had Henry VIII chosen a new name for the &quot;land of the Angles&quot;, perhaps Cymru, then those who imagine they descend from the Celtic <i>Cymry</i> would have no complaint and would take full part in being citizens of that country. I wonder how getting access to genetic markers will, in the near future, change people&#x27;s ideas of national identity - if people discover they descend from the invading Irish, Scots, Vikings, Romans, Angles, Jutes or some other group rather than the &quot;native&quot; Celts will they consider themselves less Welsh? More British?<p>Thanks for challenging my arguments and for walking through this with me, happy to get more responses to this if you have them.",1444862786

They only measured (self-reported) time spent sitting, so they really shouldn&#x27;t make any claims about standing desks or even standing generally. I suppose there is an implicit assumption that time not spent sitting is time spent standing, but that is pretty weak in my opinion.<p>Furthermore, I don&#x27;t think that aggregate time spent sitting is the right measure. We know that uninterrupted sitting is a known risk factor for deep vein thrombosis because since calf muscle contractions are important for preventing blood clots in the leg vasculature [2]. So a better measure would be the length of continuous sitting without breaks. It&#x27;s very plausible that 300 minutes of sitting with 10 minute breaks every 50 minutes might be healthier than sitting for 5 hours straight without any breaks at all (and then taking an hour break at the end).<p>1. <a href=""http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/10/09/ije.dyv191.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/10/09/ije.d...</a><p>2.

They tested the use of Prerender.io on a portion of their site against Google rendering the JS of another portion of their site. Here are the results they sent to me:<p>Suburb A was prerendered and Google asked for 4,827 page impressions over 9 days\nSuburb B was not prerendered and Google asked for 188 page impressions over 9 days<p>We&#x27;ve actually talked to Google some about this issue to see if they could improve their crawl speed for JavaScript websites since we believe it&#x27;s a good thing for Google to be able to crawl JavaScript websites correctly, but it looks like any website with a large number of pages still needs to be sceptical about getting all of their pages into Google&#x27;s index correctly.<p>1: <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/prerender-static/gwt_crawl_stats.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/prerender-static/gwt_crawl_stats.pn...</a>",1444860233

For example I&#x27;m not aware of any correlation between the historical records of warming periods and historical records of mass extinctions.<p>There is no reason that warmer temperatures or higher levels of CO2 should be bad for life in general. As cold areas shrink, populations of species adapted to cold habitats will suffer, but warm habitat species populations would expand.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to take away from the reality or seriousness of anthropogenic global warming, or give Exxon a pass. Just because something is real and is bad in certain ways, that does not mean it threatens all of life on Earth, which is how I interpret the concept of &quot;unstoppable&quot; species collapse.",1444860217

Recently I&#x27;ve been studying some literature on stochastic optimal control, and I&#x27;ve bumped into the KL-divergence concept a number of times, but never really understood it.

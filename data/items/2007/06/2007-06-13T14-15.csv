27799,comment,27297,27485,0,0,martin,,,"Right. I've always wondered about Apple's reasoning for releasing Safari to begin with. If their goal was to decrease IE's market share, I'd think they would've put their browser R&D dollars into Firefox and helped to build a single, truly great alternative browser. Plus, it seems that supporting a cross-platform browser would be another way to win over Windows users to the Mac: ""You can run many of your favorite applications, like Microsoft Office, and even Firefox, the world's most powerful web browser!""<p>Does anybody know more about why Apple took this route?",1181745741

27797,comment,27682,27682,0,0,mdakin,,,"It does not surprise me that the research is in conflict.<p>It makes sense that as programmers age they either become better programmers (through experience) OR they stop programming (the bad programmers flux out of the field with time).  These two factors combined will tend to make older programmers as a group look better than younger ones.  <p>But there are hypothetical factors that can work against older programmers as well.  For example, if the older programmer has not bothered to keep learning new things he will be locked into one domain where his expert skills are useful.  This will cause trouble if he ever needs to work on different types of systems.  ",1181745623

27794,comment,27792,27792,0,0,keiretsu,,,"Sure. It's damn cool that you can create your wonderful product at a cost of only $1000. But should you reveal the truth to the VC? Or should you lie to them that it cost $50,000? The reason is if you tell the truth, the VC might think since your cost is so low, the valuation of the company they'll give would be low too<p>I'm using the same logic as a buyer knowing the cost of a supplier. If you were told the goods cost $1, the likelihood of you bidding $100 is lower than if you were told the goods cost $80.",1181745427

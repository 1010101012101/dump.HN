I&#x27;m switching to KeePassX which I already use for $work-related data. (I have intentionally avoided the Mono-based applications.)<p>KeePassX has similar &quot;auto-fill&quot; functionality as well. It&#x27;s not as perfect or as seamless as LastPass but it is definitely usable (after a bit of one-time per-site tweaking in some cases). Having recently decided that using LastPass presents a non-zero risk, the extra effort I have to spend w/ KeePassX is certainly worth it, IMO.<p>Although I don&#x27;t do it now, I have in the past kept my password databases in Dropbox. With Dropbox also installed on my iPhone, I am able to access my password databases use &quot;MiniKeePass&quot; on iOS without any issues.<p>In addition, there are Windows, Linux, and OS X versions of KeePassX and all of them can open up my .kdb files without any issues.",1391482746

Perhaps &quot;travels with the work&quot; would be manageable though.<p>And it&#x27;s worth considering that every tweet, every photo on Flickr, every video on YouTube, every status update on FB, and so on, constitutes a new copyrightable work. Not everyone will care about the copyrights of their tweets, but some will. How do you copyright something for which you have no control of the identifiers? I assume you don&#x27;t intend for people to hit up the service for a new UUID before tweeting and embed the token in their tweet?<p>(Obviously this problem would go away if e.g. Twitter itself signed onto this scheme, automatically registering and UUIDing your tweets on your behalf.)",1391482553

7175162,comment,7174554,7175084,4,0,wpietri,,,"Thanks, this is helpful.<p>In designing things for users, I think a lot about the difference between meaning and mechanism. In early computers, you were confronted with a lot of mechanism: switches to flip, magnetic media to treat worshipfully, mysterious incantations to type. But something like the iPad, the surface interactions are mainly about meaning.<p>When you say, &quot;Git is a uni-directional acyclic graph for tracking patches,&quot; I believe you, and I believe that&#x27;s how people like Linus think of it. But that&#x27;s mostly mechanism.<p>For people who were soaking in large open source projects, I think that mechanism reflects their meaning pretty well. But for people putting stuff on the web, or building internal tools, it&#x27;s very different. The base case is, &quot;thing that is live now,&quot; and &quot;thing that will be live soon&quot;. Patches? Don&#x27;t need &#x27;em.<p>For those people (which I think is the bulk of developers today), they are forced to deal with a lot of git&#x27;s mechanism, to no real benefit. If git had been designed to be a popular VCS, I&#x27;d call that a design mistake. But I think it&#x27;s hard to claim that; as you say, git makes sense in its original context.",1391481867

Beyond that, and I need to go through agencies where they expect me to pretend to want to be full time.<p>I have manged to leverage that to get a part time gig that paid better;  e.g. I got a  high paying gig through an agency, proved myself difficult to replace, /then/ suggested they let me go part time on the same hourly rate.  Worked okay for a while.<p>But yeah, my experience is that you can demand $50/hr from random craigslist gigs.   There is a /lot/ of remote work available at $25/hr.    I remember in the early to mid aughts, I supported myself for a few years this way;  I had a primary gig that gave me a retainer that was large enough to cover rent (I think I was charging them $35/hr for retainer hours, and $45/hr for hours above that.  I mean, I was in my early to mid 20s, so it wasn&#x27;t great money, but it wasn&#x27;t terrible. )  then I would take random gigs over and above that for more money;  I had about three regular clients that I didn&#x27;t have &quot;retainer&quot; agreements with, so there was always enough money.<p>Hm.

Initially, I charged $40 a month under an unlimited subscription assuming a vendor would have a new product every month or so.  However, it turned out that most vendors only needed the service for a month or two in order to churn all their labels out then cancel.<p>In terms of price sensitivity, current vendors are charging $100-$150 a label, so the subscription plan is either an average deal, or a great deal if they have 5 labels.<p>The subscription model stems from a problem in purchasing an individual label.  If vendors purchase say one label, there is a possibility where they might have made a couple of mistakes and they have to fix their label.  The thing is I don&#x27;t really know if they are fixing the label, or generating an entirely new label.

This might not be automated to the extent that the OP is referring but it&#x27;s 99.8% more efficient than logging into 500 boxes to do it (or 200,000 in Facebook&#x27;s case). If you can get 99.8% with ease, it may not be worth pre-automating for that final 0.2%.<p>2) Knowing what is worth automating comes from experience. If I have to do something nasty once, it might be a total waste of time to automate it. There are lots of one-off things I type at a command prompt that are quicker to run than to automate. I think being so dogmatic about automation as to say you should never run things at a command line requires you to spend peple&#x27;s time non-optimally.",1391481513

I eagerly watched the developed back when the whole Bitkeeper thing came to a head. Not only did I see the start, I saw <i>the situation it was born in</i>.<p>Git is a uni-directional acyclic graph for tracking patches.<p>Git was designed around the model the Linux kernel had used, sending patch sets around. You merge people&#x27;s patch sets in, you re-base an existing patch set on the current development, you figure out what the difference is.<p>Since Git tracks all those patches (which everyone calls commits), it has a full history of them. That history is a simple graph that always moves forward.<p>The distributed stuff (like origins, remotes, etc) is just a way of formalizing all the &quot;look at my tree&quot; stuff that the kernel guys did.<p>The basic model really is quite simple (the command line certainly has a few warts), the distributed stuff makes a fair amount of sense, and the patches aspect fits in really well.<p>I think the problem is that most people come to it from the CVS/SVN model. Commits in those systems are more permanent, where as the patches floating around the LKML were always more ephemeral; you could try to apply them at any point if you could fix the merge issues. I actually wonder if borrowing so much of the existing version control system vocabulary made things worse.<p>Commits are patches. &#x27;Staging&#x27; is the stuff you haven&#x27;t send to the mailing list yet. Branches are long series of patches. Merging is accepting patches, and re-basing is apply a patch set against a different starting point.<p>If you go straight from &quot;This is what CVS does&quot; to &quot;This is what Git does&quot;, you miss <i>why</i> Git works like that. Whenever your mental model doesn&#x27;t match reality (in this case, how Git operates) you end up with frustration and confusion.",1391480469

7175024,comment,7174554,7174970,5,0,mtdewcmu,,,"Well said. I feel that complaints from users should always be taken seriously. The fact that a piece of software is better than what came before doesn&#x27;t mean that it can&#x27;t have flaws, and can&#x27;t be improved upon. I don&#x27;t think git&#x27;s command-line interface was designed poorly or to make things difficult. What I think is that the command-line interface was created as an afterthought, since git was originally supposed to be a low-level component and not a full-fledged VCS, and so the commands were cobbled together rather than planned.",1391479453

In fact, you don&#x27;t have to use the stash at all and you could even forego the staging area since you can just get git to commit unstaffed files directly. Sure, there is a reason those things exist, but if you are still in SVN world and are using git for the first time, these are not the places likely to trip you up. What you are likely to get confused by is things like rebasing, and the fact that your local repo can be modal, such as when there is a merge conflict while rebasing.",1391479286

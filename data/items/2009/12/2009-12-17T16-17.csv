In fact the market dropped from ~9000 at inauguration day to ~6500 by March. Obama's approval rating dropped from around 80 at inauguration to less than 50 now. And bad news and fear, as it turns out, still exist.<p>""It will be a big year for applications that can play on big screens... video games, movies, etc."" -- as a prediction, shrugworthy.<p>""Similarly, the big news in the mobile world won’t be a slicker, newer cellphone -- it will be smart phone applications"" -- this prediction wasn't too bad.<p>""China’s GDP is likely to plummet in 2009"" -- nope, it grew by something like 8%<p>""This year we’ll see the first computer with no moving parts"" -- trueish, though I thought that netbooks sans moving parts were already on the market in 2008.<p>Wall computing: somebody has already mentioned this. ""Carry-along computers will be hot"" -- reasonably true. ""Led by Europe, LTE (Long Term Evolution) will be the preferred technology for 4G."" -- I don't even know what this means.<p>""Not to be left behind, the less developed world will finally see widespread availability of broadband"" -- y'see, as a prediction this one is hard to fault in that it's a long term trend and I'm sure there's some places in the third world that have acquired broadband over the last year. Still, I wouldn't say the last year has seen enormous progress on that front.<p>""The Internet Assistant will be born"" -- hmm, not really. And if a product which <i>could</i> book me a flight, a car, a hotel, and make dinner reservations automatically did exist, I wouldn't use it, since I wouldn't trust it to get me the best prices.<p>""he was optimistic that having a new, competent, team in Washington, that valued science, technology, and innovation, would improve the country’s overall mood"" -- a giggle seems like the appropriate response here.<p>In conclusion, there's a few accurate predictions here, but they're just identifications of trends which should have been reasonably obvious in 2008. And then there's the impossibly naive political predictions which, the less said about the better.",1261068952

The investment doesn't matter-- the valuation does.  So let's guess that they sold a third of their company for that $180m-- that's a $540m valuation.  Is that unreasonable?  They reportedly have a run rate of $50m.  I'll bet it's twice that in a year.  What sort of revenue multiple do you think is appropriate for a high growth tech company?

You can cause work to be done by inspiring your workers, giving them a comfortable, fun place to work where they feel free to experiment and do good work.  You can also cause work to be done by telling people what to do, making it clear what the consequences are for not completing work, and restraining people.  In the last year, I've basically worked under both types of managers, and I can say that, generally speaking, my productivity is much higher, and therefore more work gets done, when I feel engaged and that my thoughts and ideas are valued and that I'm helping drive the success of the company, vs. being told what to do and feeling like my opinions and ideas aren't very valuable.<p>I think what's difficult is that this stuff isn't very cut-and-dry; there are times, as a manager, when it might be easy to give your workers a ton of freedom and to really trust them with responsibility.

I quote:<p>"" In a well known paper [2] several widely used programs (including perl and ghostscript) were adapted to use several different allocators including a garbage collector masquerading as malloc (with a dummy free()). The garbage collector was as fast as a typical malloc/free; perl was one of several programs that ran faster when converted to use a garbage collector.""<p>And this is just with single-threaded performance! I really hope both unladen swallow and macruby succeed in their goals of removing the GIL from their respective scripting languages, and I suspect that the numbers will prove that python gets better performance with a GC as opposed to reference counting.",1261065717

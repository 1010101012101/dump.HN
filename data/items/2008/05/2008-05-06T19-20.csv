Didn't know where else to put this observation, so I thought I'd hang it here if you don't mind, astine.<p>As one who takes something away from this board every day, I was excited to contribute something from personal experience.  Interestingly, this was also the #1 question posed to me over Startup School weekend.<p>I included these examples (my aunt's front porch, the dinner, and yes, Bible study) to show that business can come from anywhere, anyplace, and at any time, even when you least expect it.  As I entered these examples, I wondered what, if any, discussion would ensue.  Little did I know...<p>So today I got 2 big surprises, this thread and a little number deep inside a nested iteration that's been spewing bad data for 2 1/2 years now.  What a day.<p>[Hate to disappoint, but the most interesting thing about the pawn shop project was converting their old data without knowledge of the original author's 25 year old compression algorithm.

You may have some unorthodox views on what ""AI research"" constitutes or how much progress had been made, but prefixing your comment with ""as we all know..."" is obnoxious. The consensus view is certainly <i>not</i> that no progress at all in AI has been made since 1958.",1210103717

182757,comment,181513,182603,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Replying, ""you wouldn't know; you're an imperative programmer"" is moot""<p>That's obviously not what I said.  My reply was, ""If you believe all of the features listed above are useless in a real world development situation, I'm not capable of convincing you otherwise, as we're going to be speaking very different languages"".  I think there is a difference, though I can see how it comes off as arrogant.  It wasn't really intended that way--I'm not a great programmer, and never claimed to be.  But I know what makes me (as an adventurous, but not necessarily brilliant, hacker) more productive is good tools.  And first class functions, closures, and a great set of libraries (like that found in Perl, Python, and to a lesser degree Ruby), are the tools save me lots of time.  When I develop in PHP, and I do so pretty frequently, I miss all of those features constantly and my code is longer, less readable, and harder to maintain.<p>My point was if you haven't worked with a language that has those features you wouldn't be aware of how much time, and how many lines of code, they can save you.  I'm not a smug lisp weenie pushing the blub paradigm (though there is definitely something to the argument) or implying that imperative developers are the scum of the earth.  I'm a pragmatic sort of fellow...if it works, use it.  But if something works better, why not use it instead?<p>That said, one of the places where PHP is a perfectly valid language is web applications.  Some of the largest applications in the world run on PHP--Facebook, many Yahoo sites, etc.  But they also have lots of languages doing the non-frontend work, because PHP is really horrible at a lot of backend tasks.  Data and systems management, for example, where Perl and Python, or Java (depending on scale and performance requirements and existence of libraries), would be a better choice.",1210103676
182756,comment,182645,182694,0,0,euccastro,,,"Basque and Briton are minoritary too. (BTW, it's very funny that Basque is listed without a heading, but it's very true. It's related to nothing else, and nobody knows where it comes from.)<p>It seems that where more than one language share one territory, the area is colored with the language that is more 'traditional' or specific to it, even if other ('invading') languages have demographic majority nowadays.<p>With that criteria, they could have expanded the area for Franco-Provençal quite a bit. Also, I think Astur-Leonese would deserve its own color rather than being incorporated into the Castillian group.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astur-Leonese_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astur-Leonese_language</a><p>And just to nitpick, since the map notices small pockets in some zones:<p>- there are pockets of speakers of Galizan-Portuguese languages in Extremadura,<p>- there is this small region that Spain conquered in 1801 from Portugal, which still speaks Portuguese:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivenza"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivenza</a><p>- and there is a small pocket of speakers of the Catalan family of languages in Corsica.<p>A more officialist take on the current situation is:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_languages</a><p>This is more realistic in assessing majorities and more politically orthodox, but not any more correct IMO. Ignoring minoritary languages altogether is no less of a lie than presenting them as if they were predominant. The map sticks to political frontiers rather than language areas. Also, I don't know why it doesn't recognize Asturianu, a language co-official with Castillian, while it does recognize Basque, which is minoritary and co-official too.<p>In that map we see that the <i>Building Nation</i> efforts in France and Great Britain have been more 'successful' than in Spain. So, while it's common in colloquial settings to use the name ""Spanish"" to refer to Castillian (even the academy of the language calls it ""Lengua Española""), it's an aberration in a technical document. It would make more sense to call English Unitedkingdomish.",1210103660

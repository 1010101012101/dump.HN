That&#x27;s the definition of that word:<p>noun: recession; plural noun: recessions<p>1. a period of temporary economic decline during which trade and industrial activity are reduced, generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters.<p>So technically, the recession <i>is</i> over. There&#x27;s not much room for interpretation there unless you choose a different definition of &quot;recession&quot;.<p>All of the bad stuff you listed are symptoms of an empire in decline as well as a massive change in how the economy works. Industrialization changed the world and so will computers and information related technology. We&#x27;re right in the thick of things. We don&#x27;t <i>know</i> how things will turn out in the long term - that&#x27;s for historians 200 years from now to figure out.<p>It looks like this period of drastic change will be a mixed bag. People being put out of work by automation puts pressure on the labor market. Educational systems set up in a bygone era are failing to adapt. People are having fewer children and living longer which puts stress on everything from social security to labor markets.<p>It will probably just take a while for society to sort all of this out. And it may or may not suck in the meantime. I think most people reading this will be just fine and probably live really nice lives. Also it&#x27;d be nice if the USA and China could avoid a war/proxy wars while trying to figure out the new world order.",1418673475

8753986,comment,8753027,8753027,0,0,tzs,,,"I have a couple of questions about the schematic.<p>R4 and R5 are 0K resistors. 0K resistors actually exist, and are typically used in place of short pieces of wire. The advantage of a 0K resistor over a short piece of wire is that they can be picked and placed and soldered using the same equipment that handles resistors, thus saving the need of having a separate machine for short wires.<p>That is how they are being used here, as you can see from the layout diagram. R5 is used to carry the RST signal over another line on the board, and R4 serves the same function for VCC.<p>First question: should these even be included on the schematic? They only exist to work around a construction limitation due to the use of a single layer PCB. If the circuit was built on a two layer PCB, or a breadboard, or wire wrapped, there would be no 0K resistors needed. I thought that schematics were supposed to just convey the topology of the circuit, leaving things related to the practical difficulties of construction to other documents (like the layout diagram).<p>Second question: on the schematic, why is R5 shown as connecting RST to RST, but R4 is shown as connecting VCC to itself? They are both being used to take a line across another line, so why aren&#x27;t the both drawn the same way on the schematic?",1418673173

Some thoughts:<p><pre><code>  - Determine/guess the costs of the outsourcing and use it as the base for your
  pitch. (i.e. what can I do with ~200k for my own pitch)

  - They are open to shifting things off-site, use this to your advantage. Rails
  devs are hard to find? What about a distributed team of talented Rails
  developers? No longer are you restricted to a ~50 mile radius. Depending upon
  your location, you might have a higher cost of living than remote developers
  which is in your favor. Your candidate pool is now huge. Etc

  - Fewer/more talented developers over more/less talented developers who
  don&#x27;t even know the framework (Spring).
</code></pre>
In all honesty, I&#x27;d expect the pitch to fail given the number of seemingly poor decisions made up higher to date. I am curious, is the software being developed an expense for the company or does it make money for the company? I&#x27;d expect the former, given the descriptions.

There&#x27;s some denial there.<p>The basic problem with C++ is that it&#x27;s hard to tell if something really bad is happening. Think of C++ from the view of the maintenance programmer assigned to figure out why a C++ program is crashing intermittently.  Or worse, the security expert trying to figure out how a system was penetrated.  C++ has hiding (&quot;abstraction&quot;) without safety. This is a bad combination, one seen in few other major languages.<p>We make progress in programming partly by having the language eliminate some problem. High-level languages mean you don&#x27;t have to worry about register allocation, saving and restoring registers, or calling sequence conventions.  Assembler programmers have to obsess on those issues.  C++ doesn&#x27;t eliminate any problems from C.  It helps with some of them, but not to the point that they&#x27;re just gone.<p>The three big questions in C are &quot;How big is it?&quot;, &quot;Who owns it?&quot;, and &quot;Who locks it?&quot;.  C++ helps a lot with the first one, even though it doesn&#x27;t have enough subscript checking to guarantee the absence of buffer overflows.<p>C++ has struggled with the second one, with three rounds of auto_ptr, unique_ptr, and now reference-counted smart pointers. But because these are an afterthought, implemented using templates, they&#x27;re neither optimized nor airtight. The mold keeps seeping through the wallpaper, in the form of raw pointers.  Rust has a designed-in solution to this problem.  (Rust&#x27;s borrow checker is perhaps where C++ should have gone, but C++ will never get there.)<p>C++ as a language has no clue about who locks what.  The language totally ignores concurrency. That&#x27;s said to be an operating system problem.  This is now a very dated concept.<p>(As I say occasionally, I really hope the Rust crowd doesn&#x27;t screw up. They address all three of those big questions in effective ways.  But I see too much use of &quot;unsafe&quot; in Rust code, which indicates weaknesses in the language design.  The use of Rust&#x27;s &quot;unsafe&quot; for &quot;performance&quot; is a big problem. From a semantic standpoint, only &quot;Vec&quot; needs &quot;unsafe&quot;, because somebody has to convert raw memory to an array of objects. Everything else can be built on top of &quot;Vec&quot;. But there is unsafe code for &quot;performance&quot; in hash classes and such.)",1418670947

And I agree that it will help you remember the sources for various ideas.<p>But I think a journal is the wrong model (i.e. time ordered entries, either electronic or paper).  I have used a paper notebook in the past, but I would rarely go back and look at things, and it&#x27;s not searchable, and paper is not editable.<p>For the last 10+ years, I&#x27;ve used a Wiki.  Hyperlinks are huge.  They really do model the associations your brain already makes.  I have wiki pages that are 10 years old and that still grow new associations.  I think it takes a big load off your brain to have all that stuff written down, and searchable with ease.  (I had to write my own Wiki to get it fast enough though.)",1418670367

It triangulates demand in a particular area and if there are not enough Uber drivers to meet the demand, the price increases based on the demand and supply, thus bringing more drivers into the city and then eventually bringing the price down. There isn&#x27;t someone in an office somewhere going, &quot;Ooh, a hostage crisis, lets bump surge pricing by a factor of 4 for some sweet profits&quot;<p>The person who wrote that sentence explained what happened, of course a real person wrote it, it&#x27;s a blog post. Automatic surge pricing kicked in, like it does anywhere in the world because there was high demand and not enough Uber drivers. While the app is smart, it can&#x27;t automatically detect when there is a hostage crisis happening in the area and turn off surge pricing...<p>Such an uninformed response from the likes of a Hacker News user is actually worrying.

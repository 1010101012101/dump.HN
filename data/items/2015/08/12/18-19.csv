10049872,comment,10047417,10049520,0,0,paulmd,,,"Separate of the blocksize issue - fundamentally I don&#x27;t think the network should run on the back of transaction fees.  The benefit of a high hashrate (a secure network) isn&#x27;t limited only to those actively transferring money.  Anyone who holds Bitcoin has a stake in the network.<p>Everyone also benefits from high scalability of transaction processing, so ideally transaction fees <i>should</i> stay low or zero.  I don&#x27;t accept the idea of meta-currency (alt-currencies and sidechains) to rectify this situation - too much risk when you have a known quantity that works pretty OK.  It also decreases security by splitting processing power.  If the problem is that it doesn&#x27;t scale well, fix it, don&#x27;t replace it.  Joel on Programming&#x27;s #1 Thing You Should Never Do: start over from scratch.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to maintain the massive amount of processing power spent on this solely through transaction fees.  Block rewards effectively socialize this collective interest in network security though a very low level of inflation, which hits the right population (Bitcoin holders as a whole).  To me transaction fees should be nothing more than spam prevention, to prevent a DOS attack from clogging up the transaction blocks.<p>Really there&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t have an arbitrarily-large transaction block as long as the bandwidth is reasonable.  You still have the problem of the chain becoming too great in size, but that&#x27;s a problem with some pretty obvious answers.",1439405967

Ruby was less efficient in wall-clock time, but easier to scale up in features. It required using a database for storage rather than line-oriented text files (the problem set was too large to fit in-memory as Ruby objects at least) - a source of performance loss, as I went with sqlite to keep things self-contained. I could have coded in a pipe / batch oriented way like bash, but then I wouldn&#x27;t have gained any ease of feature implementation.<p>If you can express a problem as a set of filters and pipes, don&#x27;t need to fork too much, and have efficient executables to run each stage of the pipe, bash can be hard to beat without breaking out a real programming language with threading support. That&#x27;s because bash isn&#x27;t doing the heavy lifting, just doing process orchestration - something it does better than any scripting language I&#x27;ve used. <() in particular is tedious to do in most non-shells (and many alleged shells).",1439405884

Twitter has popularized spelling abortions (u, r, 4, etc), dumbed-down vocabulary and hashtags over substance. It may have been fine when it was just your friends chatting about what was going on during the weekend; but it&#x27;s especially egregious when it&#x27;s politicians or scientists trying to condense important subjects into 140-characters, which then get regurgitated on the nightly news. Like we&#x27;re all a bunch of 14-year olds texting each other. Even worse is when this extreme brevity leads to entirely avoidable misunderstandings.<p>I think it&#x27;d really help if Twitter were based on word count instead of character count (and didn&#x27;t count articles), so people could at least write like adults. And if you really need more than a sentence or two, then allow for a long-form text box that&#x27;d turn into a clickable &quot;More ...&quot; link after the summary message. Those that don&#x27;t want to read much can simply ignore such links, and unfollow repeat offenders.<p>Another fun side effect of this character rule: you can say 3-4x as much in a single tweet in Japanese or Chinese as you can in English (example: 象 = elephant, yet is only one character instead of eight.)",1439405701

A median 15 year return...<p>Imagine there&#x27;s a fund with a 50 year history. Three 10 year periods had a return of 15%, and the other two periods had a return of -50%. Would you invest? Hell no. Yet they have an 10 year annualized median return of 15%. Who cares.<p>Beyond that, the 2% also isn&#x27;t quite right.<p>In reality the return has been about 10% annualized since inception and the 100 year inflation rate has been 3.2%, but even that overstates some amazing returns a long time ago like in the 50s that won&#x27;t return anytime soon.<p>If you want to talk about 15 year returns, talk about the most recent 15 years... Between 2000 and 2015 the return&#x27;s have been 37% in total, or 2% per year, &quot;back out 2% inflation&quot; and I hope you enjoy your 0% returns.<p>Obviously we can cherry pick things all day like I just did, we can talk pre 2007 and post 2009, but 10% returns are definitely not reasonable for an average person for an average year, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about here, that&#x27;s what is reasonable, and that&#x27;s not 10%.

Moreover, it suggests that Ghash gained 50% of hashing power and nothing happened. In fact a lot happened, so much so that Ghash currently has around 2% of the hashing power.<p>It is hard to present an unbiased view when one is necessarily biased. But as an engineer, one would expect someone like Rusty to present a more complete view of the problems as both sides see them and the solutions as both sides present them. His failure to do so raises questions on his integrity pertinent to his responsibility to present to the community a software which can work and problems are not hidden under the carpet.<p>Specifically, the Lightning Network which wishes to change bitcoin from a payment system as stated by satoshi to some experimental, uncoded, and conceptually flawed settlement system needs to be openly presented with all its attack vectors laid out as a lot of money could be lost otherwise. I do not see how I can trust such code however when one is extremely biased and makes no attempt whatever to overcome it.<p>Good enough is not sufficient where money is concerned Rusty.

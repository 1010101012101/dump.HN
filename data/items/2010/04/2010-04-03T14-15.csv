You have to give them an old-car, new-car model: copy all their precious data, then <i>throw their entire box away</i> and give them something new that happens to be running Windows virtually.<p>A virtual PC must be as easy to buy as an iPod.<p>It must be cheap (free of any nonsense about not being able to reuse old upgrade-only copies or otherwise paying again for Windows).  A program that would let people trade in old PC hardware for fast new virtual boxes would be ideal: something that copies their entire Windows image onto it right at the store, preserving their files, much like you'd trade in your car and keep whatever stuff you had in the trunk.<p>And, it must start looking ""uncool"" or almost unheard-of to use anything else as a Windows PC, similar to the effect the iPod has had on other music players.  It has to feel ""ridiculous"" to the average person to keep using some old clunker PC, it can't just be something that tech people would think.",1270306776

I'm excited about it.<p>Yet I'm pretty sure this isn't a quirk of their advertisement, though they do want to convey relaxation as much as possible. Apple is trying very far to avoid demonstrating/emphasizing the natural usability limitations of tablet computers.<p>On-screen typing for a tablet while at a desk is rather awkward since the natural tendency is to hunch over it to see beyond your hands and look down at the rest of the screen. That's not really comfortable and doesn't look very natural.<p>Even during casual use, any two-hand operation of the screen would need some sort of support behind it. Since setting it on a desk is awkward (per above), you'll need your lap to brace a tablet for those operations.<p>I assumed Apple is just trying to keep the attention focused on how awesome their product is rather than on the usability disadvantages that are inherent in such a product.<p>The fact that people noticed the ""knees up"" nature in their advertisement means Apple failed somewhat at making this posture and behavior appear natural. I bet the creation of a site like this is making at least one of their marketing guys sadder than he was before.<p><i>Edit:</i> I just got my iPad.

I like to start with a good rice, add some veggies, a fat source, and a salt source.  Fish sauce is nice.  Cheese works well.  Crack an egg or two for variety.  If you use canned beans, rinse them well and add at the end.  Water should be 2.5 the volume of the rice.  You get one pot for several days of food and don't even need dishes.

In other words, the connection between symbol and meaning is fixed in relation to other symbols but the descriptions change based on the perspective of the speaker. Think of it like a family tree.

The judge should have been asking himself two things 'did these two brothers come up with the majority of the ideas and designs that make facebook what it is?' and 'did Zuckerberg maliciously take these ideas?'<p>If I came up with the vehicle designs for a new low-mpg hatchback and show it to a few people at Ford and then magically Ford has a car being released that fits my designs to a T then yes I'm fully entitled to compensation for it regardless of my ability to implement it. Someone else is <i>always</i> better posed to implement an idea, if we reinforced that attitude then we wouldn't have anti-monopoly laws and anti-trust cases going.<p>Copyright doesn't protect ideas, so obviously these two brothers had design documents and other corroborating evidence otherwise a judge would have never heard their case. Obviously the judge thought that beyond a doubt that Zuckerberg's relationship with these two brothers suggests beyond doubt that he took their ideas and plans for implementation to form his own website.<p>Essentially the judge looked at it like ""If Zuckerberg hadn't defrauded these two gentlemen, they would have been the founders of Facebook."" This is why they were awarded not only money but a minority stake in the company (I believe they have to go back to court to agree upon how much their stake is worth, which will be their ability to implement vs Zuckerberg's).<p>When you look at cases like this you have to realise that a million crackpots claim to have come up with the great idea before someone else did. These two brothers likely not only have documents proving it, but their relation to Zuckerberg and the fact they allegedly hired him eliminate the majority of the crackpot criteria. Judge's rarely waste their time on cases like this, so the brothers must have had a really good initial case to begin with to even get the Judge to look.",1270305186

It created awe and generated desire from the moment it was unveiled. It was obvious to those who get tech that the iPhone would be huge.<p>People who underestimated the iPhone are now overcompensating by being bullish on the iPad because they fail to understand that these are not the same thing. The unveiling of the iPad did not engender any of the feelings of awe that iPhone's did. Apple unveiled the worst tablet device they possibly could have. It was completely predictable. Every usage we've seen of the iPad has involved someone contorting his body to accommodate the device.<p>The iPhone offered a users things they didn't think were possible with a phone, and these were things they clearly wanted. The iPad offers users nothing they can't do using a laptop. It is an attempt at forcing a style of usage onto users that is clearly undesirable.<p>People will try to hype this thing and pretend they like it for as long as possible, but one can only sustain a lie for so long. This will be the end of the aura that Apple has been building for the past decade. It is clear as night and day.",1270303299

I find it difficult to even care about the iPad at all because I know in 6-months another version will be out with a bigger hard disk and some new gimmick I'm told I'm not supposed to do without simply to increase my data usage on the device so I'll later upgrade to the next model with the bigger hard drive (iPod Nano).",1270303293

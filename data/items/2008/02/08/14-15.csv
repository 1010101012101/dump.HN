112089,comment,111798,111798,0,0,NoBSWebDesign,,,"It's difficult for me to recommend a ""Hello World"" type introduction to electronics and microcontrollers, since I had 4 years of learning it in a university (obviously the budget is quite a bit different). I would say find some hobby you are interested in that uses LED's and switches, and find a tutorial on how to build that component. What you will find is that depending on the application, a simple button can be a lot more involved than you may expect.<p>For instance, if you played guitar, you could learn to make a footswitch that has LED's to tell you what channel you're on. But in this case, you'd have to look up the specs for your amp to see what type of resistance and impedance (if any) the amp expects from that channel. Furthermore, does it expect an active high or an active low signal, do you need to involve any BJT's (bi-polar junction transistors are common in simple electronics) or FET's?<p>Anyway, I'll not get into too much depth, because depending on what you're trying to accomplish, this may be overkill. That said, once you start building, Digikey is your friend!<p><a href=""http://www.digikey.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digikey.com/</a><p>Also, I hate to promote this book, because I really disliked the professor that wrote this (seriously, one of my least favorite classes ever), but his book really does answer any possible electronics question you'll probably ever have (though, again, it's probably a bit overkill).<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Electromagnetic-Compatibility-Handbook-Kenneth-Kaiser/dp/0849320879"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Electromagnetic-Compatibility-Handbook...</a><p>If you have any specific questions during your project, feel free to give me a shout.

112073,comment,111398,111419,0,0,llimllib,,,"How about Northampton, MA? I've never lived there, but I've been there many times and love the town. UMass and Amherst are right down the street, Boston's only an hour away (depending on traffic), good restaurants, great music scene, plenty of biotech (depending on your willingness to travel).<p>There's also Middletown, CT and New Haven, CT, both of which I've lived in. Middletown's a neat small city with Wesleyan University in town and a cool small downtown, classic New England. Anywhere in the Connecticut outback is a likely spot for some biotech, Bayer and others are big in the state.<p>New Haven was really ugly 15 years ago but now it's largely an awesome residential city; you want to live in the ""grad ghetto"" with all the Yalies. Cheap housing, <i>great</i> restaurants, cool up-and-coming atmosphere. I loved the year I spent there. The downside is schools - if you have kids you should send them to private school.<p>I don't know about the biotech scene, but I love visiting Portland, ME. Anybody able to speak to that city?

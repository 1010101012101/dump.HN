They had ships big enough to grow crops on deck and Admiral Cheng Ho got as far as Middle East and Africa. Then the bureaucrats, losing power to the merchants and the Navy manipulated the Emperor into declaring owning a ship with more than one mast a capital offence (!) and that was the end of that.<p>Fast forward a few years and the Portuguese show up on the other side of Africa, Vasco Da Gama at the helm. He should have encountered a Navy that embarrassed anything the Europeans had at the time. Instead, nothing, and then European colonial history happened.",1390820359

This is actually really similar to a lot of problems in real life; you can spend ages trying to find a platonic solution when a simple solution works fine given the dataset and requirements (return an answer within 200ms for example). Sometimes simpler is better, and even if you can improve the solution, it won&#x27;t really matter to whoever pays the bills.<p>There are lots of solutions though, I tried a few just out of curiosity and you can of course improve on a hashmap - the possible solutions to a problem this small are pretty similar whatever language you choose, and sometimes when a dataset is this small other more complex solutions are slower (unless you preindex).",1390820028

When using the &quot;efficient&quot; vertical wall switch panel, you already have to import your full object recognition library without errors. You then have to call up your list of mappings between rooms and switch position on the panel so you can flip the correct one.<p>With the map, you only need to load your scheme of the office into active memory to select the appropriate switch.

But if government can&#x27;t be trusted, then maybe some kind of decentralized pseudonymity-based system could work. The state could tax the pseudonyms, they might hold the access rights to medical records etc. Of course this would be cumbersome and allow a certain level of fraud, but might still be an interesting alternative in hostile environments (the state either opposes what one does, or at least does not support it).

Can&#x27;t really imagine a life without them :)\nHere are my replies to your questions:<p>* The mobile company does not have access to your data. They just issue a special SIM card that stores your private keys. Unlike the article states, there is actually also a small piece of software installed on your phone that is later used for authentication and signing.\nThe way it works is that you go to a site where you want to log in (I&#x27;ll use Estonian government portal <a href=""https://www.eesti.ee/eng/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eesti.ee/eng/</a> as an example here), you press Enter (or &quot;Log in&quot; or whatever the button is called on the site) and choose &quot;Login with mobile-ID&quot;. In Estonian government portal both your phone number and personal code are asked as &quot;usernames&quot; but some sites might ask either one of them (depends on the site&#x27;s owner). Then after a few seconds your phone will display a screen showing that a connection is being made. \nAt the same time you will be shown a &quot;control code&quot; on the browser screen that you will have to confirm on your phone. This is done in order to prevent some forms of man-in-the-middle attacks. Then you&#x27;re prompted to enter a mobile ID PIN1 code (used for authentication) into the phone. If PIN1 is correct, the screen on the phone disappears and the website is automatically reloaded with a logged in screen. You can cancel the authentication procedure at any moment. PIN2 is used for signing and works the same.<p>* Obviously it would take a lot of time to answer all the problems posed in the Wikipedia. I would disagree, however, that Estonian e-elections are easy to tamper. As Estonia is on the forefront of e-voting in the world, all these problems are addressed and analysed in great detail by our Electronic Voting Committee (<a href=""http://vvk.ee/general-info/electronic-voting-committee/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vvk.ee/general-info/electronic-voting-committee/</a>) that is involving leading e-voting experts in their work. There have been many debates about e-voting and rulings by our Supreme Court. The process of e-voting is very transparent (you can start reading about it here: <a href=""http://vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/</a>), it&#x27;s heavily audited before, during and after the voting, the software is open-sourced (<a href=""https://github.com/vvk-ehk/evalimine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vvk-ehk/evalimine</a>) and very well documented.\nBut to give a very high-level answer to your question about recounting the votes - there are many different applications and servers used in the e-voting process that keep traceable logs. If recounting is needed then these log files are used in order to determine if votes were tampered in some constituency.",1390817914

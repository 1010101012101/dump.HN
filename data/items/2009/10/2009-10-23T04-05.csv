Of course in the same way all these are followed up by thousands of small iterative improvements and boring stuff to slowly creep utility forward while waiting for the next big leap.",1256272393

Then there is the fact that <i>any</i> clean install makes a system feel snappier for awhile; let's talk again in 4 weeks and see if everything hasn't become dog slow.<p>And the rest of the article reads like someone who just wants eye candy.  3rd party programs have been able to customize the bells and whistles of Windows for some time, and they don't cost the $200-$400 that a new Windows would.<p>I do not know if Windows 7 is a great OS, but I do know that this article isn't making that case in any meaningful way.",1256272308

Accuracy is less subjective, and one can quantitatively prove that a 24-bit/96kHz sample on a modern machine is more accurate than a 12-bit/48kHz sample (most users used lower sample rates to save memory and fit more samples in at once).<p>I happen to like gritty old sounds, too.

The entire book industry is in danger of becoming collateral damage in this war.<p>Again, exactly the opposite will happen. Books are cheap, so customers will buy lots of them.

898239,comment,894061,896167,0,0,giardini,,,"Your statement is correct. Technology does cause the same problems as cheap labor.<p>But it doesn't change what I said. We're not talking about replacing men with machines, We're addressing the simple substitution of an inexpensive non-citizen for a more expensive citizen in a job. There apparently aren't machines available for these jobs so business seek out the cheapest human beings instead. If we didn't have our current political structure which attaches certain rights and privileges to citizenship then the USA would be like China where workers are treated like light bulbs.<p>Once machines can do everything a man can your argument  will be pertinent. But remember that, should the time come that machines are the full equal of men, you may need to answer certain questions such as ""Does this machine have civil rights or a vote in society?"", ""Can I trust this machine to do this job?"", and ""What sort of salary, if any, should I pay a machine for doing this job?"".

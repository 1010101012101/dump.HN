9510184,comment,9510000,9510000,0,0,Jemaclus,,,"I met my fiancee at an event in San Francisco called Nerd Nite (sf.nerdnite.com). I was waiting in line with a coworker (D) to get in, and my coworker&#x27;s friend (P) showed up, and then this cute girl joins P, and we make our introductions. I thought she was dating P, but she was <i>really</i> into me for the rest of the night, and so the next day I FB stalked her and asked her out. It took awhile to get a response, but she finally responded and we set up a date at East Bay Nerd Nite (eastbay.nerdnite.com), and the rest is history.<p>My advice is generally to just go do things you think are fun. Don&#x27;t go with the mindset of &quot;maybe I&#x27;ll meet someone,&quot; but instead just go with the mindset of &quot;I&#x27;m gonna go have a good time and talk to people and generally step out of my comfort zone.&quot; And the odds are great that if you make one new friend, you&#x27;ll get to meet all their friends eventually, and if you become friends with any of those people, you&#x27;ll meet all those friends, and so on. It&#x27;s a viral effect, basically, and eventually you&#x27;ll meet some women, and eventually, one of those women will be interested in you.<p>And my second piece of advice is that if you decide you like a woman romantically, ask her out as soon as you make that realization. If she&#x27;s a relatively new acquaintance, then if she rejects you, it&#x27;s no big loss, and there&#x27;s a greater chance you&#x27;ll both get over it and move on. If it&#x27;s an older friend, then you&#x27;re risking your entire friendship (and potentially the entire group). Anyway. I digress.<p>TL;DR: Go do fun things, talk to everyone, even if they aren&#x27;t your age.<p>Good luck. :)",1431064490

Might be easier in an urban area. I used to live in Dallas, TX, and that sucked pretty hard - meeting _anyone_ was pretty difficult. As a fairly shy/lonely person in high school, I remember my dad suggesting that I go walk the dog around the block... I&#x27;d take the dog out for a couple hours and never see a single soul, aside from people pulling straight into their garages.<p>I now live in Washington, DC, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to _not_ meet someone. I&#x27;ll start conversations running into people on nights out, chat people up at bars/coffee shops, elevators, the gym, whatever.<p>I&#x27;d suggest a few things:<p>1) Talk to everyone. I mean _EVERYONE_. If you&#x27;re used to striking up conversations impulsively, it makes it that much easier to meet someone you find attractive/interesting. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll likely over think things when it matters.\n2) Live somewhere social, somewhere urban. Suburbia and rural places attract a certain type of people, the kind that like to pull straight into their garage and chill in their backyard, preferably oblivious of their neighbors. That certainly doesn&#x27;t help your odds.<p>Good luck!",1431064387

It sounds like the intention of the iFrame exception[2] is to allow a payment form to be loaded, completed, and submitted to a compliant server all within a <i>visible</i> iFrame. From what I can tell, the &quot;compliant&quot; version of Stripe.js just submits the data (similar to the traditional way) via an invisible iFrame - the form is still hosted and completed on the (likely) non-compliant server.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, then I&#x27;d expect the &quot;loophole&quot; to go away soon and current Stripe.js users will have to adopt a payment flow similar to Stripe Checkout; in other words, it will be obvious that Stripe (a third party) is being used because the end user will be interacting with a form (or part of a form) completely hosted on Stripe&#x27;s servers.<p>For companies using Stripe to avoid PCI compliance with self-hosted payment forms, this essentially transforms Stripe into another PayPal checkout-style service.<p>[1] <a href=""https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-about-pci-dss-3-0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-about-pci-dss-3-0</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Understanding_SAQs_PCI_DSS_v3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Understanding...</a>",1431063861

Lauren Powell was a new graduate at business school.\nShe arrived late and all the seats were taken, so they sat in the aisle. When an usher told them they had to move, Powell took her friend down to the front row and commandered two of the reserved seats there. Jobs was led to to the one next to her when he arrived. &quot;I looked to my right, and there, so we started chatting while I was waiting to be introduced&quot;, Jobs recalled. They bantered a bit, and Lauren joked that she was sitting there because she had won a raffle, and the prize was that she he got to take her to dinner. &quot;He was so adorable&quot;, she later said.<p>After the speech Jobs hung around on the edge of the stage chatting with students. He watched Powell leave, then come back and stand at the edge of crowd, then leave again. He bolted out after her, brushing past the Dean, who was trying to grab him for a conversation. After catching up with her in the parking lot, he said, &quot;Excuse me, wasn&#x27;t there something about a raffle you won, that I&#x27;m supposed to take you to dinner?&quot; She laughed. &quot;How about Saturday?&quot; he asked. She agreed and wrote down her number. Jobs headed to his car to drive up to the Thomas Fogarty winery in the Santa Cruz mountains above Woodside, where the NeXT education sales group was holding a dinner. But he suddenly stopped and and turned around. &quot;I thought wow, I&#x27;d rather have dinner with her than the education group, so I ran back to her car and said &#x27;How about dinner tonight?&quot; She said yes. It was a beautiful fall evening, and they walked into Palo Alto to a funky vegetarian restaurant, St. Micheal&#x27; s alley, and ended up staying there for 4 hours. &quot;We&#x27;ve been together ever since,&quot; he said.",1431063689

Back then, when you had low load, MySQL would be about twice as fast as PostgreSQL but then as the load increases, MySQL&#x27;s performance would drop sharply and Postgres would stay consistent.<p>By now, MySQL has mostly caught up feature-wise, but there&#x27;s still stuff left that Postgres just does better. Also, even plain ideological reasons (community project vs. oracle open-core project) would want me to stay with postgres.<p>I also have anecdotal evidence that MySQL still has serious issues in the robustness department which I&#x27;ve yet to see with postgres.",1431061882

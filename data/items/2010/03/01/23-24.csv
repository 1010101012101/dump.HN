As illustration, here's a page that implements a <i>literal</i> Turing machine using Life patterns: <a href=""http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm</a><p>Starting from an empty tape, the number of states in the Turing machine must obviously be proportional to the number of live cells needed; updates to the state of the grid are equivalent to running time for the TM; and the output produced by the machine must be proportional to the population of live cells.<p>From this, we can (in a non-rigorous, hand-wavy sort of way) conclude that asking for an upper bound on the number of cycles to decide if any grid of a given finite size will be populated or barren is very likely equivalent to asking for an upper bound on the running time needed to decide if a Turing Machine of a given finite number of states will halt. This isn't actually the Busy Beaver function, but is closely related.<p>Thus concludes my proof by enthusiastic hand-waving (if there isn't a fancy Latin term for that, there should be).",1267486987

Knowing how to tie your shoes, or put clothes on, are very high priority - these are quick to learn (for a relatively developed brain) and save a lot of time (small amounts, but on a daily basis). The opportunity cost is very low, and the alternative's cost - that is, having to look up how to tie your shoes every day - is very high.<p>The basics of daily living, then, are all high priority.

I mean, software is hard, and from that article it seems more and more functions that don't really have to be computer controlled are. It's one thing for engine control units or airbags, where you have to monitor real-time data at kHz frequencies for optimal function.

I don't know how high the score was, or how many kids he had tested, or whether all the other kids were genuinely low IQ ... who care about this stuff anyway?<p>My parents were smart enough to not tell me (until I was halfway through uni), because they knew I wasn't mature enough to know that the smartest thing you can do (especially when you are learning) is giving other people's intelligence the benefit of the doubt and try to learn from them.",1267484520

Long story short, it's because there are many types of components, each of which is made by a hodgepodge of OEMs and has to interoperate with other components made by any OEM at any time in the last 20 years. Your TV has to be able to accept your DVD player, Tivo, VCR, and maybe gaming console, all of which have to also be able to feed audio out to your receiver.<p>If all of your devices were made by one company this year, they probably would (and definitely could) have a universal connector. It would probably be HDMI.<p>That's untenable because of price. Most people already have most of those things, and replace them piecemeal over time. I've actually thought about a startup to make all in ones, but TVs with integrated VCRs and DVD players have historically been so poorly manufactured that they leave a bad image in people's minds. It would be like selling a microbrew in aluminum cans. It;s a superior vessel to what's out there in every way, but because every other beer in a tin can is swill, serious beer drinkers would assume yours was too.<p>And, by the way, if you buy a Palm Pre you don't have to plug it in.

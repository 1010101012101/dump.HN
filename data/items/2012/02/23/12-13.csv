This is blatantly false. The battery management system of the Tesla Roadster keeps the battery from being discharged to a damagingly low state of charge under normal driving conditions. It's true that a full discharge to zero percent state of charge can potentially be damaging to a battery.

I try to work into their vocabulary (as well as my own) to say/think ""Wow that person has trained a lot"" when seeing feats of skill. When they themselves accomplish something I try to say ""seems you have trained a lot!"" rather than ""nice drawing"" or whatever.<p>Another hack I've applied in the way I talk with my kids is to sometimes say things that are obviously wrong. Starting with very obvious errors and as they grow older moving to more subtle lies about the way things work. If they don't catch the error I continue reasoning along the same line far enough into absurdity for them to get that I'm wrong. It makes them aware of questioning what people say and to think through themselves what is reasonable and what is not. And they now are very proud and happy whenever they are able to point out when I'm wrong about things.<p>I also never, ever proxy them towards other adults. If we are eating at a caf and they want a napkin or buy another pancake they have to talk to the staff themselves. When they want ice cream I give them money and they have to buy it themselves. Because it is such an asset to be comfortable talking to people and getting what you want. It makes them believe in their own abilities.",1329999596

Or -- you are <i>really</i> bad at efficient query design. Even highly experienced SQL-ers always look at old queries and realise that they could be three times faster and half as big, and if there is a performance issue then that's the first thing they'll review.<p>Humans have been 'understanding' SQL very well for nearly forty years -- without modern refinements like graphical query designers, either.<p>Not all data is a suitable candidate for an RDBMS solution, I am the first to agree, but there's not actually much wrong with SQL when what you need <i>is</i> a relational table store.<p>There are a few bad implementations of it, though, it is true, and a lot of people who can't seem to grasp SQL for what it is.<p>Edit: I am myself a <i>huge</i> fan of NoSQL solutions and always seek to rationally justify a non-relational datastore solution where <i>practical</i> or <i>possible</i>.

And if it turns out you can't, just say so. Something like ""Listen, I think you are really just interested in our patents, and I think we've got a lot more value in our organization - I don't think its likely that we'll be able to bridge the gap between how you'd value our patents and how I value the entire business.

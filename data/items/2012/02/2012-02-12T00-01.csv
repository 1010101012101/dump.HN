3580699,comment,3579847,3580124,0,0,lelele,,,"> Isn't that rather an argument for Java or Perl?<p>No, because then you'd have to stand either Java or Perl.  If you are looking for a language to learn beyond a quick hack, then the language matters more than its libraries.  I know Perl, and everybody knows what a boon CPAN is, but still for scripting tasks I have switched to Python.  It would have made me feel sick to keep programming in Perl.<p>As I had to choose between Python and Ruby too, besides the library thing, I picked Python because Ruby seemed like it was trying too hard to be powerful and expressive, to the detriment of clarity.  I didn't want to invest too much time in learning a scripting language.  It's just for scripting, you know, it's not meant to accomplish much.  If I need a powerful and expressive language, then I just reach for the big guns.",1329008394
3580698,comment,3579847,3580527,3,0,thehotelambush,,,"Thanks for mentioning sets - this is another thing that I would like to be built-in in Ruby. But ""list(set(mylist))"" seems like kind of a hack.<p>> you can import the rational class via a simple from fractions import Fraction<p>Sure, you can write a library for anything and by now Python has libraries for most everything. But it still makes a difference to have things in the core language, plus a nice syntax for them.<p>> why would you want to use lambdas if you have generator expressions?<p>This is a case of making up for odd semantic choices with special syntax, which then becomes an unnecessarily fixed-in-stone part of the language. Range objects in Ruby are actually like slice objects in Python. But Ruby separates the syntax for ranges from the get-item method, since there are plenty of other places where you would want to use ranges (then you can iterate and map over them, etc.).<p>Ruby uses blocks to implement things like an each method that fulfills the same function as Python's for statement. (Ruby has a for statement but it is hardly ever used.) In Ruby your example would be<p>countries.split(',').map &:strip<p>which is obviously more concise and no less readable. Compare with<p>countries.split(',').each &:foo<p>where foo is some side-effectful method.<p>IMO such a small change in behavior should result in a similarly small change in how the program is written.",1329008391

These companies seem to believe the basic laws of economics don't apply to them.<p>If you assume a simplified, econ 101 model, a competitive and transparent market will drive prices down to the point where most firms are making a low but sustainable profit. It should never drive prices down to the point where most firms are losing money in the long run.<p>Now, the real world is more complex than econ 101. But even so, I can't imagine a scenario where transparency and competition would have the long-run effect of putting an industry out of business. If all car dealerships were totally transparent about their pricing, and buyers could easily view pricing data from every dealership, how would that force dealerships to price cars below cost?

3580572,comment,3580156,3580499,11,0,tommy_mcclung,,,"One other thing I'd like to point out is the laws surrounding dealership advertising and brokering are extremely important to protect the consumer, therefor the scrutiny in the article.  We agree with the laws and they do need to be in place.  Here is why.<p>Dealership advertising laws require a vin/stock number and an expiration date to come along with all price offers.  This protects the consumer from bait and switch problems which are rampant in this space. Without these protections dealers and vendors can simply make up prices to draw people into the store and when they show, switch them to something else.<p>I understand in depth the challenges involved in doing this right from a product standpoint and it would be orders of magnitude easier to provide a product that doesn't include a vin/stock number (a topic for another post).  But the problem is consumer perception is wrong and misleading.  If someone comes to my product and car buyers can get prices on a vehicle that may or may not exist (no vin/stock number) you are enabling bait and switch scenarios.  On CarWoo! you will not have this problem, all offers have a VIN/Stock number and an expiration date.<p>Brokering laws (getting paid a referral fee from the dealer when someone you sent to the dealership sells a car) are also in place to protect the consumer.  I had one of our ex-dealers that work for us explain this to me, because at first I didn't understand why this was a consumer protection issue.  He used this example.  It may be a bit out of date, but it illustrates the point.  Let's say you're in a town with three or four car dealerships and the preacher in the town establishes a relationship with one of the dealers where the dealer will pay the preacher $500 for every customer the preacher sends their way that buys a car.  On Sunday this preacher uses his influence to recommend people should buy from his favorite car dealer.  The people in the congregation listen and when they go to buy a car, they go to the preacher's favorite dealer.  The preacher gets paid, the dealer marks up the car $500 to pay the dealer and the consumer essentially paid $500 more than they had to.  The brokering laws are in place so disclosure about the financial relationship between the buyer, the dealer and the broker are transparent.<p>Essentially you can get a better deal as a buyer without a broker and you should know upfront that's the case.<p>Hope this helps, it's taken me four years to understand all this stuff.",1329005138

For example, there is no need for the ""with"" keyword in Ruby, because you can just use blocks for that.  As another example, you can specify a block to the Hash constructor to specify code that runs when a key is accessed that is not present.<p>> Range class: [i for i in range(10)]<p>That is not a range class, that is an expression for constructing a contiguous list of numbers.

      when matcher1; ...   
      when matcher2; ...   
    end
</code></pre>
performs a method call on the <i>matchers</i>, with the object as an argument, rather than vice versa. so you can say things like<p><pre><code>    case name
      when ""John Smith""; puts ""hello again""
      when / Smith$/; puts ""are you related to john?""
    end
</code></pre>
the string ""John Smith"" and the regexp / Smith$/ will each call a different matcher to see if they match your name - a far cleaner design than the string class having to provide matchers for everything you might want to use in a case statement.",1329004975

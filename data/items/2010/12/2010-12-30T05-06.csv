2051408,comment,2048794,2049816,0,0,davidcuddeback,,,"To be fair, I don't think the points we're arguing are mutually exclusive.  You seem to be arguing that Unix can be infected with viruses.  I'm not refuting that claim.  I have no illusions of 100% security.  I'm claiming that Unix is more secure by design.  What I'm refuting is this claim:<p>> <i>WinAPI is no more hospitable to viruses than Linux is.</i><p>I think that implies that all operating systems are created equal (at least as far as security is concerned for this discussion), or that Linux is more hospitable to viruses than Windows.  I think the idea that all operating systems are created equal is laughably false.  The second idea---that Linux is more hospitable to viruses than Windows---is a much more complex issue.  Proving that there is at least one way to infect Linux with a virus does not prove that point.  All that proves is that Linux's security is less than 100%, which I agree with (hence the footnote in my previous comment).<p>In other words, your argument:<p><pre><code>    S(Linux) < 100%
</code></pre>
and my argument:<p><pre><code>    S(Linux) > S(Win32)
</code></pre>
can coexist:<p><pre><code>    S(Win32) < S(Linux) < 100%
</code></pre>
Your economic argument about OS market share is more relevant to your other claim:<p>> <i>What it is is popular enough to be worth targeting.</i><p>Your economic argument proves that claim.  I agree.  However, being less popular doesn't preclude Linux from being less hospitable to viruses.<p>> <i>(ps) the congratulatory back-patting is to head off the inevitable Linux advocacy ""you're a shill for Microsoft"" BS that comes bundled with these discussions.</i><p>Fair enough.  Those ""you're a shill for Microsoft"" type comments do have a tendency to show up in discussions like this.  I like a high signal-to-noise ratio in conversations, which is why I called you out on that, but now I see you were trying to keep the content-less comments out as well.",1293688580

2051390,comment,2048727,2049813,0,0,rst,,,"There's one other thing they do.  While they don't market books to readers, for the most part, they <i>do</i> market them to bookstores, who can be awfully picky about what they put on the shelves.  If you want to get books available on the shelves in Borders and B&N (which dominate retail in the U.S.), it helps to have a sales guy in your corner with the buyers for those chains in their rolodex.<p>FWIW, here's an author talking about that stuff:<p><pre><code>  http://www.iantregillis.com/index.cfm?blog=164
</code></pre>
His books aren't being advertised to readers much at all, that I've noticed, but the publisher is going to considerable effort and expense just to get them on the shelves.  Reviews were good, and readers who could find the first book in the trilogy liked it --- but ""folks working on the procuring/selling side of the industry don't know what to do with these books"", so they weren't doing anything, and so readers couldn't find it, because it literally wasn't on the shelves.  The upshot:  they're delaying production on the sequels to repackage the first book with new cover art that will hopefully confuse the chain buyers less.<p>For fiction, for the moment, this stuff still matters.  For technical books, enough of the order stream may have moved online that it's not worth thinking about.  (A harbinger:  I was saddened to learn that Powell's closed their physical tech-book annex last spring, due to dwindling sales.)  So, consider your market:  YMMV.",1293687935

They charge by the hour, so as an example if you have ~10 dynos running (roughly equivalent to 10 thin instances, but slightly better) for 5 days (or however long it takes for the initial traffic surge to subside), you're only going to pay about $50.

This will allow you to easily scale up to a more powerful server if growth continues or down to a less powerful one if traffic tapers off.<p>Depending on how you set things up, a common bottleneck for Facebook applications is API calls.

Then, when my boss was ready - he let some people wait longer than others - he'd tell me to go and get them, and I'd lead them through the maze of the office, chatting brightly over my shoulder.

2051324,comment,2050931,2051235,0,0,evgen,,,"Yes, it is location aware even if it is using DNS.  The DNS lookup is the first chance you have to direct a user to the right data center.  You examine the source of the dns lookup and figure out the best bgp path from each data center that will get you back to the source.  You then respond with an answer to the dns request that directs the user to what you think is the closest data center.  You may be wrong if the user is using a useless dns cache like google dns or if they are using a big ISP that keeps its dns in one location (10 or so years ago Comcast did all dns out of its east-coast data center, people learned real fast to not try to do geodns on queries coming from these servers...)  OTOH, if the user is using their ISP's ""local"" dns server then you are going to get a result that will be very, very close to optimal.<p>If you guessed incorrectly then the tcp handshake will start from the user to your server and you will know that they are not at the right server.  If the nature of the eventual exchange allows it (e.g. it will be repeated queries or a long data exchange) then you just hit them with a redirect and let the user re-open the connection to a server that is closer to them, or you seed the response data so that follow-up queries are all exchanged with the closest data center.  If the exchange is quick and not going to be repeated a lot then you will end up adding more perceived latency by trying to re-direct once the connection is established.<p>Putting this sort of smarts down at the application server is expensive.  It is much easier to do this job at the dns lookup phase and you will get a good return on the amount of investment that this approach requires.  You do need to be smart though, and make sure that you do not let geodns end up directing large batches of users that are getting service from google dns or opendns to overload a particular location.<p>Anycast is not the solution, it is just a different approach that brings its own set of headaches into the equation (e.g. pop switches during extended exchanges)",1293686467

What do I do now?",,"Hey HN,<p>So I built http://threewords.me - literally an MVP that I posted on Facebook and my friends started using. Fast forward 3 days. The entire Twitter results page for ""threewords.me"" is of tweets that happened less than five minutes ago. The site grew 2x in pageviews over the past <i>hour</i>.<p>Two problems: 1) what do I do now? 2) how do I afford this?<p>Advertising? Hosting partner? ...daresay... <i>investment</i>?<p>Sorry to be brief. If you're curious, the stack is Rails + Ruby Enterprise Edition + Passenger + nginx, which isn't cheap like PHP to host. On the $40 Linode right now but maxing out CPU at 350%.<p>227K pageviews today. 50K uniques. 71% traffic referred. 8,285 users. 3,100 new users in the past 1 hour.<p>What happens now?<p>EDIT: Hello! This thread is not going unnoticed while I take my metaphorical fire extinguisher to the fires that are happening. Will reply soon.<p>EDIT: cranked the Linode up to 4096. $160 server, woo!<p>EDIT: David from Duostack (http://duostack.com) is helping with the load on his cloud Ruby platform. Many many thanks to him.",1293685646

If you are using a chatty protocol then you can take an early guess as to the closest server based on the dns lookup and then redirect/refine the path once you are actually talking to the endpoint, but in some cases you would take more time re-establishing the connection than you would servicing it from the ""wrong"" data center so you just grit your teeth and try to either be smarter next time or add the dns server to the ""we have no idea where the endpoint is"" list.<p>In theory anycast delivery is the right solution, but there is a wide gulf between theory and practicality here.  There is a reason that no one uses anycast for anything other than dns at the moment...",1293685593

The guy regularly affirms that they intentionally try to hire only HRI's (""hot russian immigrants"") when they hire women because it boosts morale, makes hiring ambitious men easier and apparently exploits a small dip in the local hiring pool where the the immigrant women have a slightly harder time getting jobs at most places than the non-immigrant hotties they go up against elsewhere.

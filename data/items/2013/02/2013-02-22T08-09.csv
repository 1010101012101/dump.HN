5263391,comment,5262695,5263313,3,0,schoen,,,"I am also wary of people suggesting that software whose users are ""required"" to pay a per-user fee could be open source. Open source software could not come with a universally enforceable requirement of this kind. ""The license may not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software...""<p>But the prospect of open source developers being paid other than per-copy, per-user is plausible. Alex Tabarrok demonstrated in 1996 that it should be possible to do it even without altruism given enforcement of contracts and someone with sufficient information about demand. (I don't know if that kind of information is often achieved in practice.)<p>Karl Fogel just ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund creation of the second edition of Producing Open Source Software, which will be distributed on terms closely parallel to open source software (all recipients of the book can redistribute and modify it, and nobody is required to pay a per-copy license fee). The payment to Karl happened up front and ahead of time. The same structure might have worked if Karl were to apply this funding to software development instead of to writing about software development -- and indeed Joey Hess did that a while ago with his git-annex-assistant Kickstarter, which as far as I know has worked out quite well.<p>In the Kickstarter case there is a significant potential free-rider problem; for example, I didn't personally fund Joey's project but I might still benefit from his work on git-annex. Kickstarter seems to use various aspects of social norms and psychology to address free riding, often with good results.<p>I think we need more work on this even as we continue to insist on not diluting the meaning of open source.",1361523399

TIGSource covers just about any indie game that gets released, although it's better as a source of information about what's out there than as a reliable review site  the indie community is pretty small, and the reviewers are often friends with the developers. Rock, Paper, Shotgun has some of the best coverage of anything that runs on a computer, including independent games, but it doesn't cover consoles. Venus Patrol focuses on a more artsy niche, although its coverage can be pretty spotty and it's quite new too.<p>Hope that helps!",1361520228

Of the major properties in the IGN group: IGN.com, AskMen, UGO.com, 1up.com etc. they are shutting down GameSpot, 1UP and UGO[1] and laying off a bunch of people in the remainder of the business.<p>In the media world most people associate 'online' with efficient, and this demonstrates that it isn't necessarily true. There is still a lot of competitive pressure if all you are doing is running a fat organization and replacing paper with a web server.<p>Ziff apparently only paid $100M for the business[2] (News paid $600M+ only years ago) and IGN has 53 million unique visitors (in a high yield demographic - young males) across their properties, yet they couldn't make the business model work. Demonstrates just how 'thin' the new media businesses have to become in order to survive and the challenge that old media companies are facing.<p>[0] <a href=""http://investor.j2global.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=737575"" rel=""nofollow"">http://investor.j2global.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=737...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://kotaku.com/5986027/ziff-davis-shuts-1up-gamespy-and-ugo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotaku.com/5986027/ziff-davis-shuts-1up-gamespy-and-u...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pandodaily.com/2013/02/01/sources-ziff-davis-is-close-to-buying-ign/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pandodaily.com/2013/02/01/sources-ziff-davis-is-close...</a>",1361520224

5263243,comment,5259844,5261476,1,0,belorn,,,"Most of those are not actually software security features, but rather policy differences between Mozilla and Google. Those that aren't policy decision, are either not security features, or is features not implemented first in chrome (through chrome was first using it in default installation). Chrome get a half point regarding tab isolation.<p>Tab isolation by process is something between a security feature and a vulnerability mitigation feature, through I would likely call it a vulnerability mitigation feature. It doesn't do anything to prevent exploits, but it does prevent further exploits once a vulnerability has been exploited. Still its a nice thing to have (like insurance after the house has burned down) and is something Firefox should implement.<p>HSTS is nice, and now included by default in most browsers (chrome, firefox, opera). Personally, using noscript, security aware firefox people have had HSTS before firefox 2 was release. That is 2 years before chrome existed. It also exist in https-everywhere.<p>Regarding Cert pinning, I can't say I am a fan. Its a whitelist approach to security, where Google decide who is important enough to be privileged for improved security. Chrome was aware about the scaling issue from the begining, and has improved the situation by the Cert pinning extension RFC draft. Once/if it get finalized and more security professionals go through it, it will be interesting to see how it scales, what corner cases there is, and if the caching effect will come back and haunt people.<p>As for the rest... Chrome led the way of auto-update without first informing the user, while Firefox poped up a request for update. In real world security, this is an improvement because the user can't be trusted with deciding if the program shall update. Google has acknowledge that this only a useful feature on windows/Apple, and <i>has this disabled</i> on linux, assuming because a linux user can be trusted with the decision about updating. This is not a software difference between firefox and chrome, but rather a policy difference between Google and Mozilla.<p>And to comment the last features, PDF and Flash. Google has not written their own Flash handler. They have however bundled it with chrome and thus made sure its updated. This is something Firefox simply can't do thanks to license costs, which mean its mostly a difference between Google and Mozilla as organizations rather than a software improvement of Chrome. I am not sure if the same is true regarding PDF.",1361520126

4820705,comment,4818032,4818555,1,0,byuu,,,"64-bit binaries net me a 15% performance increase with my application. Obviously it can vary per application, and depends on where the bottlenecks are. It's been my experience that x86->amd64 is often beneficial: the x86 is so register starved that it makes up for the larger pointers, and most of the latter is mitigated through 32-bit relative instructions. Now PowerPC, sure. 32-bit PPC code does tend to run faster than 64-bit from my experience.<p>The other advantage is being able to utilize more than 2GB of memory per process. The reason to favor pure 64-bit is to get rid of all that extra 32-bit compatibility code. WoW64, in this case, or ia32libs on Linux.<p>Whether you're pragmatic about it or not, 32-bit will eventually go away. I'd prefer to see it sooner rather than for it to drag on for decades like IPv6.<p>And yeah, WoW64 is a clusterfuck. Basically, Microsoft wanted to make porting 32-bit applications as easy as possible. Since some applications may have been hardcoded to System32, they stuck the 64-bit libraries there, and put the 32-bit ones in WoW64. They also cloned the registry so you actually have 32-bit and 64-bit keys (see KEY_WOW64_32KEY flag.) What can I say? Microsoft's always had a thing for rigid backward compatibility at the expense of common sense design. But they are still the market leader, so I guess they know a thing or two :/<p>I don't care for your Firefox example. What if one single tab needs >2GB, like say a really high-end WebGL game? What about other applications? People found similar tricks for getting more memory in 16-bit processes too (far pointers), but we aren't still using Win16.<p>I'm accusing people of apathy because they resist change simply because it's change. I get being pragmatic, but at some point we have to cut ties with the past. Even Microsoft understands this, as you can no longer run 16-bit applications on the latest versions of Windows.",1353635991

I went on to apply to two major Silicon Valley companies, let's call them A and B, and aced the interviews.<p>I got an offer from A, which I would have happily accepted had I not had another company still contemplating their offer. Now B contacted me, not yet ready to give an offer, but they mentioned that their offer would likely be significantly larger if they would be able to see the offer from A in writing.<p>I got my offer from A both verbally and in informal writing to my e-mail. I find it clear that if I asked them for the offer in writing now, they would certainly know what's happening (given that I've kept them waiting for some time now). I told this to B already previously, they understood, but it would certainly benefit me if I had it in writing now.<p>How should this game be played in your opinion? I actually prefer A, and if B's offer were roughly the same size, I would be very happy to take A. However, I am wondering whether I am a wussy if I play it safe now, and take no action, and should I instead try to get some competition between these two. There's also a small chance that A is trying to lowball me with their offer, since I might be too humble analyzing my own value. All this leads me to think that I might just want to get the offer in writing, not caring what they think about it, but I am very very open to other ideas.<p>Also, I know that I should probably never try to bluff, and that's my intention, too - I'll never try to inflate my offer if I am not really willing to take the competing one.

Hmm, ok, better get the TSA to cordon off all malls, clubs, popular restaurants...<p>The thing about air travel is that there <i>is</i> a better argument for (some) security to prevent hijackings and bombs, both because planes are very fragile (there's a decent chance for a smallish bomb to result in the entire plane being lost and all passengers killed), and because they're usable as missiles against much larger targets (as illustrated by 9.11).  Planes, in other words, have a somewhat unique ability to magnify the effect of a given terrorist attack.<p>None of that is the case for rail transport.  For the most part, a train is simply a very crowded place, in a society that's absolutely chock-full of very crowded places.

At this stage, getting screwed over isn't so much a problem when you are new and looking long term.<p>However, it's never fun to work for free. On Elance and Odesk you can do the hourly option where your invoice is auto pulled from the buyers CC every week. You could do a 30 / 30 / 40 scheme where you get 30% down payment before you get started. You could get a down payment and then send an invoice weekly. With these schemes, even if you get screwed, it won't be for much.<p>Personally, in six years of doing freelance web development I have never been screwed over. A larger worry is generally the payment / headache ratio. Some clients are so great to work with that you feel like it's the easiest money you could possibly come across. Other clients are such a pain that you feel like you have to claw and grind for every billable. In some cases, it's better to get screwed over by a bad client and halt the project rather than grind it out for weeks / months and be burnt out by the time it's over.<p>While you will likely not have to deal with getting screwed over often, slow payments will be a much bigger problem and can hurt you as much as non payment. The same payment schemes apply. If a payment doesn't come through, then pause the project.<p>As for server access, this is very typical. Most clients will hand you their server access. Again, I have never had problems with this. An overall better method for handling development is for the client to give you access to a repo which is hooked into some sort of deployment scheme. In this case you wouldn't touch the client's server. However, not everyone will know how to set this up, so perhaps you could offer this setup to the client as part of your gig.",1353634751

Do American people agree with everything US congress and president do?<p>But there's a big difference: in the US, you can disagree with them, argue about it, protest, hold a demonstration, and do <i>anything</i> you want to make your voice heard. Remember PIPA and SOPA? How many do you think were in favor of it? And it took the combined effort of Google/Facebook/Reddit/..., a 1-day internet blackout and millions of people mailing their senators to kill them.<p>Now, imagine the same thing happening in Egypt (before and after Mobarak) or KSA? Do you think people can freely protest?! What happened to those 99%-ers in US? (almost) nothing. What do you think will happen to people if/when they protest in KSA? Prison, torture, death.<p>That's why you don't hear as many complaints from Egyptians, Arabs, Chinese, Soviets (in the Cold War era, but even to some extent today in Russia), North Koreans or Cuban as you'd like. If the choice is to live in oppression, but <i>live</i>, or to die a gruesome death under torture, most people (understandably) choose the shitty live. But it doesn't mean they don't long for a better life.<p>And remember, you always (in any dispute, political or otherwise, anywhere in the world) hear the loudest, most extreme voice. Just because the loudest voice in KSA and Egypt is also the most backward, doesn't mean everyone agrees with it. Maybe they're the minority (population-wise) and can make their voice heard because they're rich/powerful!<p>------<p>Edit: as an aside (and remember, I'm not at all anti-US, maybe quite the contrary), consider the ""Civil Rights Act of 1964""[1]. Some Martian coming to Earth in 60's might think: ""hey, those American were no different than Nazi fascist they fought in WWII. Black people couldn't use white people's bathrooms, or sit on 'White-only' seats on the bus? Couldn't even go to the same schools, or apply for the same jobs? That's fucked up."" - It's fair to assume that American were/are racist based on that fact, but you and I know that it's not true. Most Americans were NOT in favor of segregation, not all of them approved of slavery, not all of them were racist... Yet, it took about 200 years after US independence for them to gain these right. Hell, 2008 was the first year that there was a possibility that the president might not be a white man (Hillary Clinton / Obama)! Does that mean American people (of today) are anti-woman or anti-black?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964</a>",1353633406

Because the communists smashing the Four Olds and industrializing the country and kicking out the foreign imperialists got the country on track.  Of course the British ignore the famines they cause, and dig up so-called famines by their former imperial conquests.

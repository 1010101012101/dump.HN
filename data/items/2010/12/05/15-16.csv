There's a lot of great research and evidence that supports your thesis, and I don't think that the majority of the population has any idea that it exists. People still seem to be enthralled with this idea that there are geniuses out there who never had to work hard or practice... as if Jimi Hendrix just picked up a guitar and played it to perfection without ever practicing for a second.<p>For anyone interested in the research in this area, there is a great piece from Harvard Business Review by K Anders Ericsson called The Making of an Expert. And Malcom Gladwell's Outliers is also a fun read on the topic.<p>I think we are currently demystifying the process of becoming ""talented"" at any given endeavor.

But it's important not to take the emphasis on passion too far.<p>Because this hypothesis doesn't explain the existence of passionate but untalented people. Such people exist. Dear god, do they exist. There are people who play a hell of a lot of guitar and are nevertheless not very good. There are people who write a lot of novels and stories but can't produce enjoyable prose, or sellable prose.<p>To paraphrase Edison, success is 90% perspiration. But that still leaves 10% for inspiration. You need <i>directed</i> passion, and the ability to properly channel and manage your passion is a talent. It might not be an <i>inherited</i> talent -- you can develop it -- but you need to do more than just noodle around for more hours than the other noodlers. You need to develop a specific constellation of skills in order to make progress.<p>At the risk of overgeneralizing, the most important talent is meta-analysis. You have to be able to self-analyze and self-correct. (If you can't hear the fact that you're unable to play on the beat or keep a steady rhythm it doesn't matter how many guitar chords you know.) You need the social skills and awareness to seek out criticism, listen to it, and act upon it. (If you don't hear your fellow musicians dropping hints, or don't act upon those hints, you won't get better.) And you have to cultivate abilities that may seem unrelated to the problem at hand... because <i>you</i> recognize, consciously or instinctively, that they are essential to your goal. (Professional scientists, for example, need a lot of sales, political, management, and literary skills. And, famously, our stock consumer PCs ship with lots of fonts in part because Steve Jobs audited a calligraphy class during his brief career as a college dropout.)",1291563190

By then, mathematicians were used to thinking of (ijk) as a matched set.<p>Vector calculus replaced quaternionic analysis in the 1890s because it was a better way to write Maxwell's equations.  But people tended to write vector quantities as like this: (3i-2j+k) instead of: (3,-2,1).  So (ijk) became the standard basis vectors in R^3.<p>Finally, physicists started using group theory to describe symmetries in systems of differential equations.

1971709,comment,1971588,1971675,0,0,cloudsigma,,,"You raise a number of interesting points.<p>Firstly we can't comment on the arrangements of other companies for whom we don't have visibility. As a customer you can of course ask them and one would hope they are able to provide you with a full answer. On the blog we raise and answer (in our case) the various aspects for data storage, not just of security but also legal issues and data migration aspects. How many customers currently using an IaaS cloud can answer those questions or get their vendor to provide answers? Building confidence in cloud computing is all about transparency, education and creating secure ways of working. Different users will choose different solutions and regimes that they feel are 'secure' for them and we are all for that. We'd also like people to be able to make informed choices which means having the right information.<p>Secondly, there is a big difference between a vendor that has sole root access and full visibility of all your data and one that doesn't (as in our case); in our cloud the customer retains sole root access to cloud servers. This means our employees don't have visibility into cloud servers in the way you suggest. Further, as clearly stated in the blog, the issue raised is about data leakage i.e. data being accessible between cloud users. There are other issues regarding vendor security but this doesn't negate the points being made about data leakage.<p>Finally, your point regarding the encryption being a placebo is specious. There is a big difference between making systems secure against casual data theft/leakage or the actions of rogue employees and a company that is institutionally set up to lie and steal their customers' data. If you think your vendor is actually of that nature then no security measure can help and that's the case for any company you have dealings with. It really isn't a valid criticism of any security measure that may be put in place.<p>The measures we outline and have implemented on the vendor side do address the real issue of data leakage that occurs with block storage devices in IaaS clouds; they are effective and they are convenient. Our storage performance is generally higher than many other vendors to begin with and we have much feedback from customers regarding this even after using encryption. These customers are getting good performance in a secured cloud. For them it makes sense.<p>Best wishes,<p>Patrick",1291561357

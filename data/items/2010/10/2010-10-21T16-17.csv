1816361,comment,1815901,1816172,0,0,sasvari,,,"Psychology Today tries to give an explanation on <i>Why Intelligent People Drink More Alcohol</i>, and they claim:<p><i>It is important to note that both income and education, as well as childhood social class and parents’ education, are controlled in multiple regression analyses of these data from the US and the UK.  It means that it is not because more intelligent people occupy higher-paying, more important jobs that require them to socialize and drink with their business associates that they drink more alcohol.  It appears to be their intelligence itself, rather than correlates of intelligence, that inclines them to drink more.</i><p>also interesting:<p><i>Consistent with the prediction of the Hypothesis, more intelligent children, both in the United Kingdom and the United States, grow up to consume alcohol more frequently and in greater quantities than less intelligent children.  Controlling for a large number of demographic variables, such as sex, race, ethnicity, religion, marital status, number of children, education, earnings, depression, satisfaction with life, frequency of socialization with friends, number of recent sex partners, childhood social class, mother’s education, and father’s education, more intelligent children grow up to drink more alcohol in the UK and the US.</i><p><a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201010/why-intelligent-people-drink-more-alcohol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundament...</a>",1287680392

Why does one person want the warmth of the needle, versus another wanting to change her child's diaper. Perhaps the ultimate selfless act is subjugating your wants in the first place, though I imagine you could argue this is also a selfish act.

I discovered my passion for programming at the age of 32 through the initial Ruby on Rails podcast. Unfortunately I couldn't program at all at the time, had never knowingly used unix and so spent the next 2 years teaching myself most evenings after putting the kids to bed.<p>The key thing for me actually landing a job was through meeting up with a local programmer. I'd discovered his blog, realised he was local and arranged to meet up with him for a beer. He told me that there was a Ruby User Group in town and so I plucked up the courage and went to the next meeting - it was great! At the third or fourth meeting heard through a fellow attendee that the company he worked at was looking for rails programmers. Two interviews later and I was employed.<p>I'm not a world class programmer. But I consider myself very fortunate to have discovered my passion at what seemed to me at the time so late in life.

I feel that the risk adverse nature/attitude we came across significantly impedes innovation in the UK (remember this is in my experience and this was around 2001-2005). I believe we had to work harder to overcome this and this took focus away from our core activities at times. We often found no one was willing to invest unless you had 5 years of track record and £1mill/yr turnover and if you where doing something disruptive (like we were) and innovative in a new market, then it was even harder. So I guess I feel there is more chance that good startup WITH cash will fail due to being crushed by this problem. Plus I think the US is known for its better startup fostering nature and work ethic as suggested in this article. <a href=""http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/11/20/european-startups-need-to-work-as-hard-as-valley-ones-or-forget-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/11/20/european-startups-need-t...</a><p>Wooly reasons but having said all that, times have changed and I'm not against UK startups at all, I would just like to look at US ones first...

MBA has about the same user experience as a netbook"", somebody would bring out a point for point feature comparison, and tout the processor or something.<p>Let's face it, despite unrelenting FUD from Apple regarding this exact type of ultra-portable form factor since netbooks first hit the market, there is fantastic utility in having something in your bag about the size of a hard-cover book that you can do general purpose computing on even if it doesn't offer the ""full"" experience that the larger products do. It's light, it fits pretty much anywhere, you can do real work on it, the battery life tends to be pretty good.<p>In typical fashion, Apple's taken a look at the segment, and consumer demand (don't kid yourself that people haven't been pining away for a Mac in this form factor since netbooks first came out), taken their own spin on it (let's make it small <i>and</i> thin, with a better screen, only SSD drives, and a beefier processor!) and put out a credible, nice looking product with the typical Apple tax associated with it -- nothing terribly surprising. But now, because of the relentless slamming of the form factor called ""netbooks"" (they've poisoned that well), so they call it a ""notebook"", but it's not just a notebook, it's a special line of notebooks designed to be super-thin with a subset of the normal ports you'd find on their larger cousins.<p>But seriously, the 11"" MBA is Apple's spin on making a nice netbook.<p>Is there something wrong with that? I'm tempted to buy one because that's precisely what it is. I almost couldn't imagine running around without my netbook these days. Having a credible Apple made option is fantastic.<p>So here's my computing needs in this form factor. I'm an amateur travel photographer and a musician, I take lots and lots of photos and write lots and lots of music. Having something small that's a real computer with decent storage is very important to me. I don't want to drag along a bunch of external peripherals like hard drives or the like because I'm already dragging around a camera bag full of a heavy camera body and some lenses. This form factor works for me because I can actually open and use the machine in incredibly tight spaces, like coach seating on a plane and I pretty much don't even notice it in my bag when I'm running around. Plus I offload my day's shots to the computer every day and review and do some light editing back in my hotel room or on the plane (or ship or whatever). After a week or two of shooting, I easy take 50-80 GB of photos. Plus software and other junk (I like to play back a collection of old jazz 45s I have on the machine as mp3s while I edit my photos), I pretty regularly fill out the 160GB drive on my current machine.<p>I'm pretty happy with the form factor of my 9"" 2 and a half year old netbook.

<a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7318/full/nature09486.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7318/full/nature0...</a><p>In re: 1,<p>""Mitochondria must respond quickly to changes in membrane potential and the penalty for any failure to do so is serious. The electron and proton transfers of chemiosmotic energy coupling generate a transmembrane potential of 150–200 mV over the membrane (~5 nm across), giving a field strength of about 30 million volt per metre, equal to that discharged by a bolt of lightning. This high membrane potential sets the inner membrane of bioenergetic organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts) apart from all other eukaryotic membrane systems. Failure to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential is penalized by a collapse in energy charge, blocking active transport across the cell membrane, and a rise in free-radical leak, which in eukaryotes and many prokaryotes leads directly to programmed cell death.<p>....<p>""This requirement for physical association of genes with bioenergetic membranes to maintain ATP synthesis constrains both the genomes and the complexity of prokaryotes. If some genes for oxidative phosphorylation must be physically associated with a certain unit area of bioenergetic membranes, then beyond that threshold prokaryotes could not maintain membrane potential homeostasis unless additional genomes are co-localized with the membranes.""<p>In re: 2,<p>""The main difference between endosymbiosis and polyploidy relates to the size and distribution of genomes over evolutionary time. In endosymbiosis, surplus organelle genes are lost or transferred to the host’s chromosomes, streamlining endosymbiont replication via cytoplasmic inheritance. The outcome is a massive reduction in genome size, both in prokaryotic endosymbionts and organelles, with a reciprocal relocation of genes in low copy number to nuclear chromosomes in the latter. By contrast, in giant polyploid prokaryotes, all genomes are essentially the same. Without cytoplasmic inheritance, no genomic specialization ensues.<p>""In principle, prokaryotes could control respiration using specialized, membrane-associated plasmids that emulate organelle genomes in gene content and function. In practice, such plasmids are not found. Bacteria usually have small, high-copy-number plasmids that segregate randomly at cell division, or very few giant plasmids that co-segregate with chromosomes on filaments from midpoint. For plasmids in a prokaryote to support electron flux as organelle genomes do, high-copy-number giant plasmids encoding components of the electron-transport chain would need to associate with the plasma membrane, and evolve counter to the tendency to segregate with size rather than function. That no mtDNA-like plasmids are known indicates that high energetic barriers preclude their evolution: unlike organelles, which pay back energetically from the start, substantial energetic costs must be paid up front (high copy number of the correct plasmids, and the machinery to associate them with the membrane at regular intervals) before any energetic advantage can accrue.<p>....<p>""Thus, being large and having masses of DNA is not enough to attain complexity: cells need to control energy coupling across a wide area of membranes using small, high copy, bioenergetically specialized genomes like mtDNA. Segregating the genes relinquished by the endosymbiont (mtDNA) into low copy number in the host’s chromosomes, specialization of the endosymbiont into an ATP-generating organelle and increasing organelle copy number provides sufficient energy per gene to support the evolution, maintenance and expression of some 10^5 more host genes, affording the cell the chance—but not the necessity—of becoming complex.""",1287678477

My biggest bit of advice to you is to get your hands on a good data structures and algorithms book (Java is fine), and learn the crap out of it.  Since you like programming, you'll enjoy this, and it'll help you in interviews and as a programmer.  In particular, make sure you know:<p>linked lists
binary trees (be able to code insert, traverse, find on the spot; read about delete but don't worry so much about keeping it all in your head)
sorting (quicksort, mergesort, maybe a few others)
read about balanced trees, b-trees, etc, follow and try out the code, but don't worry about keeping it in your head
Hashmaps (what's a hashing function, how to keep good performance)
Graphs are fun, and once you can code trees, you have all the tech skills, but the algorithms in graphs are very interesting... and now and then does come up in an interview.
SQL - I still get asked about this a lot... know the basic stuff (select, conditions, joins) cold, and also make sure you know some of the grouping functions (HAVING) and how outer joins work.  Anything more elaborate will get you points, but probably won't hurt you if you don't know the answer.<p>Personally, I find it slightly obnoxious that interviewers rely so heavily on this stuff, but it <i>is</i> actually kind of fun.  I always review this carefully before an interview.  It can make the difference (in fact, I'm pretty sure I missed out on a job because I let it get stale and fumbled around too much... it's a shame, if I'd spent my usual 8 hours preparing, I probably would have rocked it).<p>It's a lot to learn, but it sounds like you enjoy this anyway.<p>One other thing... to get experience, try taking on a small software project for your current employer.  Once you've done it, you'll have ""official"" experience.  Sounds like I started in a similar spot to you (math major with some CS coursework), so I had to work a little harder to convince employers I could write code.

And the doctors and nurses we dealt with avoided being frank with us, because they worried that would be rude. They worried about hurting our feelings. But in the end, when my dad died, my mom and I were caught off guard and unprepared. And in retrospect, I realized, what we needed was for some doctor to be brutally, awfully, harshly honest with us. None of the doctors we dealt with had the courage to do it. And of course, to some extent, my denial is my own responsibility. The only fault that can attach to the doctors is the fault of not giving us information clearly.<p>So, nowadays, when I deal with entrepreneurs, I try to be as honest with them as I wish the doctors had been with me. It's a gift to be that honest. If the entrepreneurs want to call me negative, then perhaps they don't deserve the gift that I'm trying to give.

And things like food safety and public vaccinations are cheap and valuable so bundling all of that stuff up and simply taxing income seems more reasonable than trying to have individual taxes on every transaction with the government.<p>As to leaving I think that's an important option.

On the other hand, the vocabulary is limited. Phrases like ""turn left"" and ""turn right"" are easily distinguishable, and other unobtrusive audio cues could make it clear that the words came from the GPS. Over the course of the hack day, intelligibility improved dramatically as I tweaked parameters.<p>Mainly, this is an experiment, and there are lots of ways to improve on the first day's results to make it more practical. Instead of following the melody exactly, the pitches could be chosen from a limited range to be consonant with the song.

You certainly don't need a mod operator to make it work -- if you're capable of writing a function, you can write <i>divides_evenly_by_3(int number)</i> using facts that every fourth grader knows.<p>If you prefer, you can substitute a similar problem which doesn't require even fourth grade math.

1816042,comment,1814613,1814672,0,0,mbreese,,,"Simple answer: No.<p>Long answer: Who knows?  Apple has always developed the Mac port of Java, with a lot of customization in the GUI (custom Swing properties, events, etc).  This was historically because at the time, the Mac user base was too small for Sun to support themselves.  So, Apple took over the project and has run with it ever since.  They've added some good things to their JVM too, such as shared memory for libraries (I believe).<p>However, I think that now, Apple has decided that it isn't worth it for them to support it.  So the answer to your question will largely be up to Oracle.  If they decide to port Swing over to the Mac, then I think there is a shot of having a good JVM for 10.7+.  If not, I think that you can say goodbye to the JRE in the Mac.<p>It isn't like the client has ever been a big focus for Oracle.  To them, Java is all about the backend.  They may want to work on a JVM for the Mac just to allow developers to still code on their Macs, but I'm not sure.",1287677166

310948,comment,310815,310815,0,0,smanek,,,"In my experience, SATs are one of the few good predictors of intelligence (in a necessary-but-not-sufficient sort of way).<p>Truth be told, the SATs aren't particularly hard so most bright people could walk in and take the test cold turkey and pull at least a 1500. Of course, there were a lot of false positives from people who took prep courses and worked their asses off (but, as a former princeton review tutor, I <i>never</i> saw more than a 100 point gain in any student no matter how hard they worked - and most were lucky to get 50 points). A kid whose parents had a few grand to burn on a princeton review course could boost his score from 1300 to 1350, but never to 1550.<p>The problem with GPA/extracurriculars were that a lot of not very bright people could pull 4.0s and have good 'leadership' experience by gaming the system. And, even worse, a lot of smart people couldn't. A lot of the smartest people I know barely graduated highschool (or didn't). They saw the bullshit for what it was, and often had a knack for rubbing people the wrong way (especially at 16 - most of them can 'play the game' as adults).<p>(Note: all my experience was with the old 1600 point SAT)",1222072999

How does sending a postcard to a site confirm your identity?  I can understand the site sending out a postcard with a verification code on it but for the user to send in a postcard doesn't seem to make sense.<p>Besides that it looks like an interesting phenomenon.  Simply increasing the latency of posts would probably improve the quality.  With no instant gratification many trolls simply wouldn't bother posting.<p>This seemed flawed to me, ""To post opinions in the Tsukurepo section, advance approval from those who introduced the recipes is necessary.""  I bet all the reviews are raving.  Seems like a nice way to stifle differing opinions.",1222072936
310946,comment,310815,310815,0,0,silencio,,,"Can't happen fast enough.<p>I'm unhappy about the weight SAT (and ACT) scores are given in the application process because I will be a (junior level) transfer student and I see even less relevance of the SAT in my position when it's already fairly useless for freshmen. I find it mindboggling and frustrating to think that half the colleges I am applying to are requiring such a useless thing while the others are doing the right thing by not even caring for such a score.<p>In college, I have taken math classes above second semester calculus. I have fulfilled basic general education requirements. I have fulfilled more than expected of a junior-level transfer student in classes related to my major. All of those credits should overwhelmingly trump what I can do in a few hours with a pencil and a calculator for something laughable in comparison. To the point that taking such a test would be unnecessary to point out what I am capable of doing: honestly, is how well I do on some trivial algebra (lazily done entirely with my ti-89) or writing going to tell you how appealing of a computer science major I will be? I'm pretty sure you can safely ignore the SAT and take a look at my classes, grades, experience and recommendations to make a better guess. And the same should apply to high school students as well.<p>Not to say I did not do well on the last SAT exam I took (on the contrary, because the material is so basic), but why I had to spend the money and waste the time to do so in the first place just stinks. I have taken prep classes way back in high school, and I've tutored people in turn. The article is spot on when it says that students are spending time gaming the SAT.<p>(On a slightly different sidenote, I don't think the SAT is the only cause for high school classes (at least in the US) being so focused on a small curricula, I believe that's more directly caused by NCLB and tying school performance on exams to funding. But that's a whole different rant/issue in itself.)",1222072800

310941,comment,310872,310918,0,0,netcan,,,"Because it has failed (thus far) to make a substantial impact on the way people use web apps.<p>How many people have it installed? How many sites have it enabled? What apps/sites exist & are popular that wouldn't be useful/popular without gears? What apps/sites exist that are replacing installed apps thanks to gears? For an example to count it needs to include more people outside the top 5% of internet users.<p>Personally I wouldn't call it a dud yet. It's mostly for readers, online office apps & calendar. These are used mostly by the top 5% anyway, so it'd be hard to take a stab outside that segment with Gears. Mail is the online app that has penetrated, but those that need off-line mail generally have a client installed already. It'll take time to move them since 'you don't need to install a client' isn't an incentive if you already have one. But this is a pretty big change they're trying to pull off. A lot of people are going to have trouble even finding gmail without a Google search.<p>Like I said, I wouldn't call it a dud. I wouldn't call it a success either. Like the post says, Chrome might bring it all together.",1222071484

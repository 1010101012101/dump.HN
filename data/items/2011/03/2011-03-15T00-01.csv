I have been using these techniques in languages from Haskell to C/C++ as much as possible, and they have vastly increased the quality of the software I write (measured in defects).

By HIROKO TABUCHI, KEITH BRADSHER and MATT WALD
Published: March 14, 2011<p>TOKYO — An explosion early Tuesday morning damaged the No. 2 reactor at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, the third in a series of blasts that have now hit each of the three crippled reactors at the plant, plant officials said.
Enlarge This Image<p>It was not immediately clear if the blast was caused by the buildup of hydrogen, as occurred at the two other reactors at Daiichi — one on Saturday and the most recent one on Monday, when there was also a large explosion at the No. 3 reactor. Some early reports in the Japanese press suggested the latest explosion amounted to a different and more critical problem than the previous two.<p>This explosion, reported to have occurred at 6:14 a.m., happened in the “pressure suppression room” in the cooling area of the reactor and inflicted some degree of damage on the pool of water used to cool the reactor, officials of Tokyo Electric Power said. But they did not say whether or not the incident had impacted the integrity of the steel containment structure that shields the nuclear fuel.<p>Radiation levels around plant spiked after the explosion to 8,217 microsieverts an hour from 1,941 about 40 minutes earlier, the company said. Some emergency workers there were evacuated, though the levels would have to rise far higher to pose an immediate threat to health, officials said.<p>Any damage to the steel containment vessel of a nuclear reactor is considered critical because it raises the prospect of an uncontrolled release of radioactive material and full meltdown of the nuclear fuel inside. To date, even during the four-day crisis in Japan that amounts to the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, workers had managed to avoid a breach of a containment vessel and had limited releases of radioactive steam to relatively low levels.

While Dvorak and tau may be objectively better, the real world gains to be had by switching to either are slim in reality. I already type upwards of 90 words a minute on Qwerty and I doubt that switching to Dvorak would yield much of a gain to my typing. The problem behind pi is that it is never explained correctly, and this can be worked around by fixing pedagogy without having to introduce yet another physical constant. If the United States switched to the metric system, however, doing business with foreign economies would immediately become easier and we would no longer have to memorize long tables of arbitrary conversion factors. It makes much more sense objectively AND pragmatically to use units that are derived from physical quantities, rather than legends about kings' feet and so forth. With the other two examples, the pragmatic improvement isn't there -- the improvements in quality of life/quality of thought that we would experience simply aren't worth the trouble of switching.",1300149853

More important I didn't try to think about my strengths and desires, and try to fit my program to that. My second time through was laser focused on CS, math, and engineering. For me, that translated into close to two letter grades.<p>One thing I had picked up in between was a strong desire to learn the computer. I didn't grow up programming, so Perl was something of a revelation to me. I picked up C after that and read Code Complete, another revelation. About then I figured out that I wanted to work on software professionally.<p>I continued to work on programming skills and CS outside of the four walls of my program (and I still do).<p>There was no secret sauce in getting into Amazon. They were (and we still are) desperate for people, with hundreds of engineering openings today, who know CS fundamentals, are not one-trick ponies (ie, work at many levels of the stack, from UI through service to DB), and can code their way out of a paper bag. There is a ton of customer-impacting work to do and never enough engineers to do it all.<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that if you can solve algorithm, coding, and design questions in phone screens and on the white board, and communicate your thought process along the way, you will be head and shoulders above the vast majority of the candidate pool. Having a work record of delivering software products helps too. That said, you are not likely to pass the interview loop if you try to fake your way through.<p>After I finished the MS CS, I worked at a defense contractor and shipped some software in C++/Qt/MySQL. I learned a lot and loved my coworkers, but the defense industry environment was not for me. I read Steve Yegge's posts about Amazon and services and the rest, and that was for me. The ones about interviewing are all still relevant for the Amazon interview. The specific questions have changed, but the areas to bone up on are basically timeless.<p>Then I submitted my resume online for a position in Amazon's Recommendations team. I didn't know anyone in the company (although it turned out that I ran into acquaintances after I joined). I didn't get picked up by them but somebody else needed people badly and started the hiring process with me.<p>There are a broad range of teams and experiences at Amazon. Some teams are high pressure, high reward (Kindle comes to mind). Some are redefining industries, like AWS. Front-end vs. back-end. Huge resources, many dependencies, and a two-year roadmap vs. two guys launching a brand new business.",1300149365

2325199,comment,2321919,2324935,0,0,mpyne,,,"Now these are better questions. :)<p>As far as hydrogen goes, the building itself was not designed to be the containment (instead there's a hefty steel containment around the reactor and primary piping from what I understand), so I don't think they bothered trying to make the building resistant to explosion from the inside (since they didn't have to). It would still be better to have the building in place, but I think the answer is as simple as it wasn't necessary for the meltdown casualty analysis.<p>I'm not sure if the Mk I and II containments contain a core catcher or not. Modern designs do from what I understand, but I would imagine the Mk I does not. Perhaps the Mk II does.<p>The Three Mile Island core suffered much greater fuel melting and still didn't make it past the reactor vessel, but a lot of that depends on core geometry as melting progresses, and the TMI reactor vessel was much stronger than the Fukushima plants since TMI was a pressurized-water reactor. On the other hand, the Fukushima designs have the steel containment that would catch any core leakage out of the primary initially and as long as they have seawater available they can keep the steel containment intact, and without having to send that seawater into a high-pressure system.<p>I'm not sure what they mean by damage to the suppression pool. The suppression pool is a torus of water that steam from the primary system is ducted to when pressure relief valves lift, which acts to condense the steam and help with filtering some of the radioactive contamination to keep it from going airborne. Doing this heats up the suppression pool, which will itself boil eventually.<p>I assume this is what they meant when they talked about venting the containment (as opposed to the reactor or primary). Anyways, if the suppression pool is damaged I assume that means there is a leak of the water inside of it, which would leak to the bottom of the steel containment. Without water in the suppression pool any venting of the reactor would not be immediately condensed, and would cause higher levels of airborne radioactivity inside the containment building for Unit 2 (intact AFAIK). This would not affect the ability of venting the reactor to lower pressure though, which is important for allowing water to be forced into the coolant system.<p>Anyways, some of my IRC buddies have clued me more into a blast at Unit 2's suppression pool? I'll try to read up on that. Until then:<p>According to <a href=""http://rushi-langaliya.blogspot.com/2011/01/boiling-water-reactor-bwr-advantages.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rushi-langaliya.blogspot.com/2011/01/boiling-water-re...</a> control rods are inserted into the core from the bottom. I'm not certain of BWR design but obviously if all the metal is melted then the control rod could fall out (this was actually a concern with Chernobyl which used metals with very low melting points to hold up control rods). I will say the plant I was on had about 5 different ways to keep control rods in position whether there was power or not so I'd be very surprised if the control rods weren't latched in place now at the very least. But I don't know for sure, don't want to tell you otherwise.<p>* I don't know what their control rods are made out of, but the good assuming is that control rods melt after fuel does. That actually means the fuel would melt <i>down</i> away from the control rods before lumping up. If there is coolant there, the fuel shouldn't melt further. If there is no coolant, the nuclear chain reaction can't go critical again since the fuel is not enriched enough (the coolant actually also helps aid the neutron chain reaction). I can't speak to reactor protection analysis for BWR to that level of detail, but again I'd be very surprised if that's something that wasn't considered <i>at some point</i> between the 1960's and the last couple of years.<p>If they had considered it and concluded there was a risk of re-criticality they would have taken measures to preclude it. That might be why they're already using boric acid for instance.<p>As far as plutonium, it has a fairly long half-life, which means it's not very radioactive. With that said it is an alpha-emitter so it is very important that it is not inhaled. As long as it's not inhaled it's not a large concern from there radiologically. As with any other heavy metal though, it is highly dangerous chemically.<p>Hopefully better information gets put out at the press conference.",1300148808

I have two sons who are very ""twice exceptional"" (gifted with learning disabilities plus other handicaps) and I did extremely well in school but a medical handicap has held me back and generally frustrated me in life.  Finally getting a diagnosis late in life allowed me to begin moving forward, but from a starting place of a deep pit, in essence.<p>I have come to think that ""impostor syndrome"" is probably at its worst with ""twice exceptional"" folks -- folks who are both more intelligent or competent than average and also have some kind of handicap (ADHD, OCD, dyslexia, whatever).  I have found that the best antidote involves figuring out what is real and what isn't.  I mean, I have done so many things that people said ""could not be done"" -- and I don't mean they said that <i>I</i> couldn't do it, I mean they said that <i>no one</i> could do it. -- that listening to other people about what my limitations ""should"" be is utterly useless to me.  At the exact same time, there are lots of things that I find incredibly difficult or problematic that most other people don't struggle with.  My observation has been that people like me frequently only find out what their actual limits are by hitting a metaphorical wall at like 100 miles an hour.  When I fail and fail big, then I know I cannot do it.  That is the only real, meaningful test.  Listening to other people and their predictions/estimations/whatever doesn't work.  Nor am I actually a good judge of what I can or can't do.  My own predictions of my own ability sucks eggs.  I've worked hard on finding less disastrous ways to find my limits and to fail more gracefully but failing still is basically the only reliable test of my limits.<p>Learning some real world, hard numbers that compare your abilities realistically to others helps.  There are some sources of info out there and all that. And then just gradually testing your limits in some manner that is meaningful to you which gives you the feedback you need to judge what you are really capable of and whether or not it is genuinely better than what most other people could do in that area.  Sometimes such data can be quite hard to come by.  But there are ways to develop mental models for assessing such things.",1300148439

2325112,comment,2325066,2325066,0,0,pessimist,,,"Turns out all the optimistic scenarios beloved by Hacker News were sadly wrong. The containment for reactor 2 is almost surely damaged now. If I understand correctly, the suppression pool is vital to maintain integrity primary containment as it vents extra pressure steam and is also the source for water that is pumped in to the primary containment to keep it cool. After the explosion pressure in the suppression pool dropped to 1/3, implying its seriously damaged. It may be only a matter of time till the primary containment itself is damaged.<p>Its not apocalypse yet, nor will it be apocalypse even if the containment fails. Chernobyl after all resulted only in a few hundred deaths. But there are a few more complicating factors here. Primarily, if reactor 2 does indeed go in to full meltdown and radioactivity escapes freely, how will the other reactors be maintained? They are still critical. Sadly I think several of the workers there will likely be giving their lifes for this.<p>Secondly, Japan is much more dense country than Ukraine/Belarus were. And finally, the country's infrastructure is not yet restored to normalcy. Surely power/water/communications all will further breakdown.<p>Still, Japan itself has recovered from even greater calamities - as the Prime Minister reminded us. I believe in this case, within a few months recovery will be with us.",1300147492

Part of the certification process is passing the math praxis.  If I remember correctly, all teachers in the state of Virginia must pass the math praxis I.  I was surprised (actually dismayed) at the large number of my colleagues who thought it was challenging or had to take it more than once before passing.  Here are some sample questions: <a href=""http://www.studyguidezone.com/praxis_math.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.studyguidezone.com/praxis_math.htm</a><p>My wife (who also got certified to teach in Virginia) just told me that many of her colleagues couldn't pass this simple math test and several had to take it multiple times before passing.  She said that some teachers simply couldn't pass it so chose to teach in North Carolina for a while and then move back to Virginia (because after so many years the teaching certification from another state was automatic).<p>tl;dr: The tech leaders of tomorrow will not be from America.",1300147490

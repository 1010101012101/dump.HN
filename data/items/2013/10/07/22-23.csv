Sinatra + Unicorn can drive some pretty nice reqs/second, but if what you need is actual &quot;concurrency&quot; as opposed to just reqs/second performance, go Node.

In politics, we have to question not only whether a prosecution is just but whether it is brought in the interests of the public or to further a private interest. That&#x27;s why the interest registers are public.<p>I stated the facts as they were and didn&#x27;t embellish it at all (I could have easily written &#x27;his fourth largest contributor is a Luxury Apartment Rentals Company!&#x27;) because I&#x27;m not trying to suggest that he is some how &#x27;in the pocket&#x27; of Glenwood. I didn&#x27;t even go down the list of campaign contributors to see whether there were others (which I&#x27;m sure there are, and just looking quickly the next donor on the Real Estate list is East 46th Realty which is also owned by Glenwood).<p>What I&#x27;m trying to suggest is that like all of America&#x27;s politicians, he is under the influence of lobbyists and the reason he is taking this issue seriously is because people with money have put it on his radar.<p>The luxury apartment rentals market is under threat from Airbnb. I&#x27;m just about to do a 3 month rental in NYC and some of the apartments available are amazing (often costing thousands of dollars per night - clearly out of my price range but not for others). If the luxury rental companies are worried about other people in the building using AirBnB, that suggests that the same apartments they are leasing are available on AirBnB. I can&#x27;t think of a scenario where lost profits isn&#x27;t a huge issue for these guys.<p>I get what you&#x27;re saying, and I agree that in any event the state always wants to help property owners who pay most of the taxes. But I think a measure as broad reaching as this is something that is designed primarily to intimidate users of the platform. If the state were serious about the tax collection aspect it would just force AirBnB to calculate and collect the hotels tax, not seize data and selectively prosecute its users. People aren&#x27;t going to run through the laws in their head and question what the State is trying to achieve. They are just going to get scared when they hear the State is seizing AirBnB data and stop using AirBnB.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that this is some kind of grand conspiracy, I&#x27;m suggesting that it is just business as usual in the USA.",1381185984

There&#x27;s some cachet in being one of the first to get a new -foo-.<p>In hindsight, the only real currency change criticism in Australia that had substance was a coin change. We replaced our $1 and $2 notes with a heavy &#x27;gold&#x27; coin, and there was a criticism from blind lobby groups that these coins didn&#x27;t &#x27;ring&#x27; when you dropped them.

Handing over a $50 note, the cashier marked it with a felt-tip pen. At this stage, I&#x27;d been using polymer notes for nearly 20 years, so I was puzzled and asked what it was for.

Gates has never said he plans to sell all of his stock by X date. He holds $63 billion outside of Microsoft. I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s at least as likely that Gates will hold onto a multi-billion dollar stake, and that his goal is to limit risk by not having such a singular large position in any one investment. His goal being to maximize the amount of money he can put to use in the foundation, and minimize the chance of a big portfolio loss.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that by 2018, he will have been sitting on that stock for roughly 43 years!

With Java you know with complete certainty that it returns a List of String (and only String). With Scala you have to infer it from the method name and hope it&#x27;s honest. Likewise with the filter function. Whatever your opinion is of explicit type declarations, they are not mere &quot;boilerplate&quot;.<p>There are certainly other savings in your Scala example apart from types, like the filter lambda function. I&#x27;m just a bit incredulous that Scala advocates <i>genuinely</i> think this saves them large quantities of time over the course of a project vs. an IDE-assisted Java version. I mean, how much longer would it take you to write or grok that Java for loop? Seconds? How much longer to do it 100X in a project? Minutes?<p>There has got to be a deeper underlying emotional reason why people advocate Scala -- which is not to invalidate that reason at all. It&#x27;s important to <i>feel love</i> for your tools.

6511730,comment,6502430,6510290,1,0,jarek,,,"It would make it a little faster since electric trains can accelerate out of stations a little faster. It&#x27;s not a major difference at Caltrain&#x27;s station spacing though.<p>The other issues you mention have little to do with diesel/electric Caltrain/BART differences. Caltrain could easily run late trains if its funding allowed, and in fact might be able to run later than BART, which begins shutting down at midnight to do maintenance on its raised and tunnelled track. Mid-day and weekend frequency is again a function of funding/chosen service level - more is clearly possible since there&#x27;s 5 trains an hour during weekday rush hours.<p>One difference that might arise from electrification is support for electric multiple unit rolling stock. This is a setup where rather than being pulled/pushed by one big locomotive, each passenger car has smaller motors and propels itself. (BART cars are like this, but this can also be done with more commuter-level service.) This way the costs for three shorter trains an hour vs one long train an hour are closer than in diesel, which has the big fixed cost of the heavy locomotive, and it becomes more feasible to operate same capacity but more frequent service during times of less demand.<p>But again, this is also possible with diesel (diesel multiple unit) and has more to do with type of service Caltrain chooses/is asked to operate rather than electrification or dedicated right of way.<p>The real difference stems from funding models and goals of the service. BART is treated as near-metro (and in the central parts, is a metro) where moving people fast and conveniently is a goal. Minimum service is kept at 20 minutes even in outlying areas at 11 pm on a Sunday, not because there&#x27;s many people taking it, but because that&#x27;s the standard. Caltrain is primarily a commuter service through wealthy areas to make fairly rich people&#x27;s commutes a little easier. People taking trains at 9 pm are not a particular priority.",1381184769

The theory behind any anarchistic system, by nature, is the abolishment of any hierarchy. Capitalism, by nature is completely hierarchical, and without some sort of third-party governing it, even more so. I know the ideal form of capitalism is small companies exchanging freely without government intrusion, but the reality is that capitalism, mixed with human nature, eventually leads to one corporation that rules everything. This has been shown to happen <i>even with government intervention</i>, which is where anti-trust laws and worker&#x27;s rights came from.<p>So if you piss off &quot;the corporation&quot;, you have their private militia come after you. Then their courts sentence you to death, or slave labor. How is this anarchistic? Seems pretty top-down to me. Just because a company is running things doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a government.<p>I just don&#x27;t really understand libertarianism, I guess. It makes sense if you&#x27;re filthy rich, but otherwise you&#x27;d just go from being middle class to a peasant with no rights almost instantly. Are all libertarians filthy rich and just very vocal (there seem to be a lot of them), delusional, misinformed, or am I missing some large part of the theory behind it?<p>The only way I could ever see the phasing of government out working successfully is in a shared economy (anarcho-communism). Not that I think human nature would ever permit a system like this until tens of thousands of years of psychological/spiritual evolution take place, but I think at the time humans are able to self-organize in every sense there will no longer be the need for personal possessions.

Christopher Chabris, the author of the blog post submitted here, is a good friend of several of my friends around the country, and I have interacted directly with him in online communities of human behavior researchers. So I take Chabris&#x27;s criticisms of Gladwell&#x27;s writings, especially his most recent book, seriously.<p>Gladwell is indeed on record saying that he doesn&#x27;t write to be true in the scholarly sense, but to be thought-provoking. He has said in an interview that he writes to try out ideas.<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122671211614230261.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122671211614230261.html</a><p>&quot;Q: Do you worry that you extrapolate too much from too little?<p>&quot;A: No. It&#x27;s better to err on the side of over-extrapolation. These books are playful in the sense that they regard ideas as things to experiment with. I&#x27;m happy if somebody reads my books and reaches a conclusion that is different from mine, as long as the ideas in the book cause them to think. You have to be willing to put pressure on theories, to push the envelope. That&#x27;s the fun part, the exciting part. If you are writing an intellectual adventure story, why play it safe? I&#x27;m not out to convert people. I want to inspire and provoke them.&quot;<p>And Gladwell is good, while trying out ideas, at crediting his sources. Any reader of a Malcolm Gladwell book (as I know, from being a reader of the book <i>Outliers</i>) can check the sources, and decide from there what other sources to check and what other ideas to play with. Gladwell doesn&#x27;t purport to write textbooks, but I give him a lot of credit for finding interesting scholarly sources that haven&#x27;t had enough attention in the popular literature. He is equaled by very few authors as a story-teller who can tie ideas together in a thought-provoking assembly. And in particular, I recommend Gladwell&#x27;s &quot;Disclosure Statement,&quot; an essay about conflicts of interest for professional writers,<p><a href=""http://gladwell.com/disclosure-statement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gladwell.com/disclosure-statement/</a><p>which I learned about from another HN submission. Gladwell has strong integrity of a kind, but it is not the integrity of a scholar of psychology like Christopher Chabris.<p>Regarding the new book under review, I am particularly worried about claims that dyslexia is any kind of advantage for anything. Many cases of dyslexia are the woeful result of poor practices in teaching reading,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/readseri.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/readseri.html</a><p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/readbook.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/readbook.html</a><p>and it would be very regrettable to drop efforts to improve initial reading instruction on the flawed theory that dyslexia provides advantages to young learners. Gladwell says he is &quot;happy if somebody reads my books and reaches a conclusion that is different from mine, as long as the ideas in the book cause them to think,&quot; and definitely we should all think each time we read anything.",1381184332

6511610,comment,6507614,6508394,4,0,AnIrishDuck,,,"My understanding (also not a lawyer) is that passwords are protected under the 5th amendment when the very act of giving them is testimonial. Two cases where this appears true:<p>1) Your password is &quot;ITotallyKilledThoseTwentyPeople&quot;, e.g. the password contains testimonial evidence. This can probably be circumvented by allowing the defendant to enter their password privately.<p>2) Your lawyer successfully argues that the very admission of knowing the password to a thing is testimonial. In other words, let&#x27;s say the feds find an encrypted hard drive labelled &quot;child pornography&quot; under the couch at your apartment. If your argument is that a friend left it there, and the feds can&#x27;t prove otherwise, then the very act of decrypting that drive would be an admission that it&#x27;s yours, and hence a violation of the fifth.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see where law settles in this area.

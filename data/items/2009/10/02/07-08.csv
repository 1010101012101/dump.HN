Unless both founders have perfectly matching visions, their joint command will be as bad as design by committee. Someone is bound to leave or become somewhat subordinate to the other.

In some places the C# is much clearer than Python, so it's a bind I would say.<p>For most of my projects I cannot use Python anyway because it's simply too slow and uses too much memory, so I'm glad that there is a fast statically typed language that I actually start to like.",1254467593

And I have to scroll through a huge block of random things to get to the actual comments. Which is very confusing since it&#x27;s hard to get the indentation of the lower ones without seeing the top.<p>So I would like to be able to close that just like in any IDE allows you to do in order to read the others topics.<p>What do you think?",1403157546

I mean I&#x27;m not a brain surgeon, so I&#x27;m operating with possibly a great deal of very wrong assumptions about how the brain recovers and heals from lacerations.<p>Would it be like trying to mend a spinal cord injury, which we still haven&#x27;t quite mastered? Or since it would be surgery, would the brain take to it like rejoined pieces of healthy brain tissue, after the removal of a malignant tumor? I suppose a lot of that would depend on the quality of the custom grown tissue, and the technique of the operation.<p>Either way, nerve cells are essentially highly specialized finicky amoeba, with dendrites acting as elaborately decorated pseudopods. They don&#x27;t quite &quot;swim&quot; like white blood cells, but sort of creep along, and test each other out, delicately and selectively. And apparantly human cells can specialize to the point where a single cell can recognize key concepts of individualized external human identities (the article mentions Jennifer Aniston and Luke Skywalker).<p>So, in the sense that dendrites are pseudopods, and pseudopods are, along their external surface, celluar membranes (lipid bi-layers, decorated with embedded proteins), the proteins are the specialized structures that ultimately drive the behavior of the cell to direct it&#x27;s psuedopods this way or that way. It&#x27;s a mixture of chemical reactions all the way down, even if there is a layer of very fundamental electrical processes mixed in, due to the deliberately maintained PH value, and shifting electrolytic potential of the chemicals involved.<p>There was an article describing brain behavior as analogous to a swarm of ants. This makes sense, since ant communities guide their collective behavior by tagging their territories with scent, which gets reinforced with increased ants marching along pathways. So, at the end of the day, some kind of transplant process would probably require an arm of research tackling the micro-scale and nano-scale structures and living behavior of the tissue, but also the chemical aspects of how neurons sniff each other out, and decide to stimulate each other through the electric polarity fluctuations of their electrolyte juices.",1403157439

For example consider the following two structs.<p><pre><code>  struct Point { int X; int Y; ... }\n  struct Size { int Width; int Height; ... }\n</code></pre>\nIn either case the data structure is (int, int). But they&#x27;re typed differently: one is typed as Point and the other as Size. This makes it very annoying to write functions that are compatible with both. Let&#x27;s say we write<p><pre><code>  AddThenSquare(Point A, Point B) {\n    return new Point((A.X + B.X)*(A.X + B*X),\n                     (A.Y + B.Y)*(A.Y + B.Y));\n  } \n</code></pre>\nTo make Size compatible with that function you need to either refactor your code so that both Point and Size adhere to the same interface, or alternatively implement conversion functions. The latter option is what C#&#x27;s .NET framework opts for where Point and Size are taken as parameters to each others constructors. But it doesn&#x27;t scale. What happens when you use a third party math library with its own point implementation? Your number of conversion functions grow by n*(n-1) where n is the number of classes that need to be converted between. To be fair I think C# has technical reasons for not having an interface between Point and Size (structs don&#x27;t play nicely with interfaces) but even if it was included it would still be a royal pain making sure all other math libraries adhered to the same one.<p>In practice it&#x27;s rare anyone will have the foresight to put interfaces everywhere they&#x27;re needed, and it&#x27;s even rarer that programmers will use the same interfaces across libraries. It begins to sound like the &quot;specialization within functions that inhibits and penalizes casual cooperation&quot; that Alan Perlis was talking about.<p>At some point you start to wonder why the compiler cares at all what the name of the data is if the underlying information is the same. You could have dodged the headache altogether if you were in Python where a point is a tuple (x, y).<p>Still I&#x27;m not convinced static typing is to blame... it&#x27;s more that the kind of static typing employed by Java, C++, C# is especially rigid.",1403156108

Having spent a lot of time working with it we&#x27;ve found a few areas where you can get burned a little; particularly if you&#x27;ve structured your repos as a set of libraries, as seems to be the encouraged golang pattern.<p>When you have multiple libraries you have to be very specific about when you run godep, lest you find yourself with two libraries needing different versions of a common library, for example Main imports Foo and Bar, which both import Baz. Godep provides a mechanism for handling this: each dependency is explicitly locked into a fixed revision (e.g. commit sha, in the case of git). The pain comes about when during debugging as it can be very hard to reason which version of a library you&#x27;re using.<p>Additionally the revision aspect is also a bit of a PITA, we use a development flow which rebases our small commits into a big commit and then merges that into our master branch; if you ran godep prior to that you&#x27;re now referencing a commit that no longer exists. Given the chain of references that can exist this can go a very long way down. This same pattern also forces you into needing to push your dev branches to an origin server, as godep checks out the repos during the build, which while pretty benign a concern is a PITA if you forget and your build breaks because of it.<p>We&#x27;re strongly considering moving to &quot;one big repo&quot; to help combat this issue (as well as a few others) for our internal golang repositories. Referencing &quot;published commits&quot; in 3rd party libraries is an acceptable level of pain. We&#x27;re not entirely sold on this yet... just considering it.",1403155816

7914592,comment,7912465,7912887,3,0,Derbasti,,,"I generally agree with what you say. Four things though:<p>- I have found that learning how to write simple macros can simplify writing LaTeX significantly. If you dislike how you have to write the same five invocations in every figure, just make that a macro. \\newcommand is easy enough to learn. Treat your LaTeX like you treat any other programming task. Build abstractions, refactor.<p>- I recently switched from pdflatex to lualatex. Now I can write &quot;macros&quot; in Lua. This finally enables me to write complex stuff, like a LaTeX environment that converts markdown to LaTeX, or some fancy table editing stuff. I can now bring to bear my regular programming skills on LaTeX code!<p>- There are a few data formats that convert cleanly to LaTeX. I actually write my documents in org-mode, which is then converted to LaTeX. While this sounds like a recipe for disaster, it actually works great because of two properties: One, you can always write plain LaTeX inline in your org-mode stuff, which will be copied verbatim into the resulting document. Two, the resulting LaTeX code is clean enough to just switch over to using that in case something catastrophic happens to org-mode.<p>- There actually is one very viable alternative to LaTeX: HTML. HTML5 and CSS3 in particular introduced very comprehensive support for paged media and there are a few excellent HTML-PDF exporters available out there. Just imagine how much cooler it is to write plain HTML, and take care of all the formatting in CSS. This also enables the use of preprocessors like Markdown, and Javascript for programmatic content (like MathJax for equations). This really works, and it works today. The effort to write beautiful documents remains high though, on a similar level to writing beautiful LaTeX documents.",1403155613

Well, you <i>could</i> proxy the request through your servers, but that could get relatively costly.<p>Ideally: either the service allows you to generate short-lived tokens (server-side, ideally without a request to the service), or you sign requests for the client.  In the latter, you generally gain some measure control over what apps can do, with relatively small cost.  Basically that&#x27;s what you can do with S3 file uploads - your server can generate a signed URL, then the client can upload to it, all while you retain complete control of your API secrets.",1403154634

It also totally destroys the back button, flooding the browser history. I&#x27;m running Windows 8.1, Firefox 30, 16gb RAM, i7-2600@3.4ghz (it&#x27;s my HD video & multitrack audio editing machine)<p>I&#x27;m not even switching tabs.<p>Doesn&#x27;t appear to even display in IE11, although to be fair, I just opened my DR-110 up and, while it renders, and most of the buttons are functional, the knobs are not, and no audio plays back.<p>Playback of beatpetite seems steadier in Chrome, but as I typed that, I got an audio hiccup. The visuals are noticeably jerky. Again comparing to my DR-110, it&#x27;s pretty clear I&#x27;m using a different approach to the audio playback because I&#x27;m getting seriously weird glitches on my playback. And the CSS buttons don&#x27;t quite line up on mine in Chrome the way it does in the other two browsers.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t spend too much time chasing a solid tempo down.

7914552,comment,7913532,7913532,2,0,ggchappell,,,"Interesting chart.<p>Lots of things to wonder about. For example, it looks like incidence of measles was waning in the decade before the introduction of the vaccine. Exceptions include Kentucky, Tennessee, Hawaii, and Alaska, all of which -- I imagine -- hit some population/transportation threshold that allowed diseases to spread more easily. But the rest generally have incidences that are decreasing, and certainly lower than they were around 1940. Why?<p>Also, there are virtually no measles cases in 1945. We get light pink in Utah, Washington, California, and Idaho -- and nowhere else that I can see. Of course, any disease is going to have its off years. But 1945 witnessed the end of WWII, and I would think the resulting movements of large numbers of people would have increased both person-to-person contact and mobility, making it prime time for an epidemic. Apparently not. Why not?",1403154366

Is it that it is more challenging, but in a way that it&#x27;s not more difficult to get it right (what exactly is the challenge then?) or is it not riskier because the higher probability of getting it wrong does not decrease the probability of getting it right (how exactly do you increase one probability without decreasing the probability of the negated case?)?<p>> This applies not only to Javascript, but also to all scripting languages.<p>So, a bridge built from matches isn&#x27;t any more robust than a bridge built from toothpicks, therefore building bridges from toothpicks is a good idea (nevermind that other people are using reinforced concrete for bridge construction)? I&#x27;m sorry, but I can&#x27;t quite follow your argument.<p>> If you disagree, you&#x27;re invited to take a look at End-To-End, find a side-channel leak and write an exploit for it. You could earn serious cold cash with that finding.<p>You are not seriously bringing forward the &quot;secure-because-hacking-contest&quot; argument, are you?<p>> Re your last point: if doing SSH in a browser isn&#x27;t crypto I don&#x27;t know what could be.<p>Sure it is, but it still is rather obviously not what those posts are primarily attacking. Or maybe it is, if anyone claims or implies that this &quot;SSH-client in a browser&quot; is any more secure than &quot;browser frontend to SSH-client on the server&quot;. Which I think is kinda the whole reason for its existence? Performance- and complexity-wise, I doubt that it makes any sense at all to implement the SSH protocol itself in the browser in that case, vs. using a native SSH client on the server.",1403154149

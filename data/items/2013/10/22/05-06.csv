I&#x27;d start with some of the books with lots of amazing start-up lessons like the Lean Startup and read blogs from other entrepreneurs and notable VCs (Paul Graham, Bothsidesofthetable, AVC, et al). Hacker News is also a pretty great community to search for help on stuff as it comes up.<p>Beyond doing lots of reading, I&#x27;d say, it depends. The start-up mantra is, build something people want. If you find writing/blogging can help you on that path, do it. Certainly meeting and talking to lots of potential customers is a must. Building a product is also a must. I think about the choices of what I&#x27;m doing and always try to filter it by whether or not it will get me closer to these things.<p>But it will really depend on your business.

I just feel dirty everytime I use ARC, like I&#x27;m being sloppy haha. It also hides a lot about memory management that new people might never learn (and thus be in bigger trouble when something does go wrong). But I accept that it does have major advantages...<p>One trouble now is you never know if a library or whatnot will be ARC so it fragments things somewhat.",1382418247

I disagree that these applications will reside in the cloud however, because those are essentially provided and administrated by a central entity.<p>It&#x27;s more likely that such an autonomous corporation would provide a cloud service. The protocol could be designed like bitcoin to reject hosts that don&#x27;t meet certain criteria (such as latency or security). With Homomorphic encryption techniques being advanced these types of clouds could even be somewhat secure.",1382418195

I termed it &quot;formula explorer&quot; and was going to ask some people if something like it was in Excel 2013 (at work we&#x27;re on 2003). This would be great for my mechanical engineering work. We often have formulas that reference many sheets with many constituent formulas. To check them I usually have to create another sheet that shows the flow of values concisely on one sheet, basically a manual version of what Slate does. This tool would automate that, looks fantastic.",1382418090

ESX has been EOL&#x27;d, however it relied on something called the &quot;Console OS&quot; to bootstrap itself until the vmkernel would take over and start scheduling tasks.  The Console OS was actually a modified Red Hat Advanced Server (later Enterprise Server) instance which once the system was booted would act as a kind of &quot;privileged guest&quot;.  You could log in to it and do sysadmin-y tasks like add users, install RPMs etc.<p>ESXi, on the other hand, was written to do away with the Console OS entirely, but it still has a fairly rudimentary shell.  Many of the utilities are based on busybox and the idea is it should be stripped down with only really minimal functionality.  It also sported something called the Direct Connect UI (DCUI) which is a curses based interface for doing things like settings up an admin password, reviewing logs and changing security settings.",1382418015

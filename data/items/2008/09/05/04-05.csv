Because the ""working quite well"" is only really valid for single threads with no shared data structures. In other words, when you pretend a thread is a process.<p>As soon as you have more than one high load thread, the OS will want to split them across multiple processors, which means that you're now trying to share the same chunk of memory between processes. If the OS tries to keep them on the same core, though, then you've got 2 processes competing for CPU time and leaving another core free.<p>Then again, even turning them into processes on a modern OS wouldn't distribute the memory contention all the time; memory is usually copy on write across forked processes, which means that unless you've written the memory, reads are still contending for the same bus.",1220590683

I have some friends who are staunch Mac users and others who eat, sleep, and pee linux. All of them have microsoft products on their computers. Schools, offices, homes, microsoft is everywhere all over the world.<p>The sad fact is that pc's are cheap and most people (general population) are lazy or uninterested in installing (or even learning about) other operating systems.<p>The product is sort of forced upon us. All we can really do is cope.<p>It seems like a lot of people upgrade their windows operating system when a new one comes out (except with vista because of all of the bad reviews).",1220590330

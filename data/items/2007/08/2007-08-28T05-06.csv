47331,comment,47291,47315,0,0,staunch,,,"That addresses the question partially. It says they're not going to do anything short-sighted and evil like others might. <p>I think it's wise to trust the YC partners not to do anything  intentionally nefarious, but to assume the worst of their unconscious minds.<p>When smart people read hundreds of ideas its got to cause a huge swarm in their heads. Most of the ideas get immediately buried in the unconscious. There's a definite chance a YC applicant's idea could eventually emerge and find its way in into a YC-funded company, in some form.<p>I definitely don't think this is a reason to not submit your application though. Everyone is going to know your idea after you launch anyway. If secrecy is your biggest asset you're in so much trouble this is a trivial concern.",1188280605
47330,comment,47030,47030,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Truly excellent web design is never found in such lists. A good webpage, especially something as simple as a blog, makes the text easy to read and the structure of the site easy to see, and gets out of the way. It's more or less a solved problem by now, and seeing a bunch of good web designs is like seeing a bunch of good spoon and fork designs.<p>The stuff in this link is impressive if the aim is to look like futuristic Macromedia Fireworks mockups from five years ago.",1188280520
47329,comment,47291,47321,0,0,rms,,,"I got the impression that the YCs had discussed the idea my team applied with before we had applied. This only helped us land the interview, because they knew we were trying to tackle a big, important unsolved problem.<p>They certainly haven't launched a company doing what we wanted to do and no other YC company has, so you really don't need to worry about them stealing/sharing your idea. It's just not worth it for them.",1188280260
47328,comment,47232,47232,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Nobody died.  It was a good day.<p>Sorry if this sounds trite, but I'm being sincere.  You're alive.  You didn't lose, I mean really lose, anyone you love.  I read somewhere that numerous studies indicate that people get happier, on average, the older they get (I'm apparently not old enough to be happy all the time, but I'm hopeful)...I suspect it has something to do with a growing understanding of what really matters.<p>Jobs don't matter.  Girlfriends, that you know don't love you, don't matter.  Phones definitely do not matter.  Cars do not matter.<p>Your health matters.  The health of your loved ones matters.  That's about it.  Everything else is just scenery.<p>In short: It looks worse than it is.  Get some rest, and when you wake up tomorrow, it'll look a little better.  In a week, you'll wonder what all the fuss was about.  (Yes, I've been without a car, insurance, and a steady job, with $30k in credit card debt, to boot.  Hard times come and go pretty easily if you're learning from your mistakes.)",1188280182

47324,comment,46739,47274,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Woops! You got me. I got carried away. I'll only admit being half blind though, because I'm willing to bet that ""emerging markets"" will eventually visit the same cycles of soft development that are taking TechCrunch headlines now. Brazil is not a question. Vietnam/Thailand... ok that's SE Asian.<p>Turkey is a possibility. A little west of India are others. East European countries like Slovenia. Alright, maybe the effects aren't immediate enough to be obvious like South Korea, but new markets will appear and you might just want to do something about it if you have the chance.<p>I guess I failed to back myself, oh well. I don't need to change your opinion though. Whatever works.",1188279376

47322,comment,47310,47310,0,0,Harj,,,"we found that having a specialized graphic designer who can't do any coding wasn't very efficient for getting things from idea to prototype quickly. having someone who has an interest in design and good UI but can also hack is the ultimate - that's worth trading generous equity for.",1188279090
47321,comment,47291,47291,0,0,zaidf,,,"To play devil's advocate, what if YC folks have already thought of the idea you had(and obviously did not pick you for reasons other than your idea)? See, it goes both ways. <p>Bottomline: it is very difficult in this environment with start-ups launching left and right to claim ownership of a certain idea, even between two parties.",1188278904
47320,comment,47310,47310,0,0,staunch,,,"I'd love to have a graphics/HTML/CSS/Flash designer for my most recent project. Neither myself nor my partner would be willing to trade much equity for one though, if design was all they'd contribute. Between the two of us we have enough design sense and skill to create beautiful-enough minimal designs. I think any good hacker can   do simple and effective design if they try.<p>Earth-shattering graphic design is out of easy reach for most of us, but designing simple to use interfaces doesn't take much more than careful thought and a desire to do so. A big part of what designers do just isn't necessary in a startup where the founders actually care about making things good already. Designers are often essential at larger companies, where the employees aren't motivated enough to give a lot of care to things like ease-of-use, flow, and beauty.<p>

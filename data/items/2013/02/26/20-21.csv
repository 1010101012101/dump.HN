Obviously we can't prove it was a celiac case, but it matches our modern experiences in our gene line pretty well, so it is at least not an unreasonable theory.

He's one of the 1 in 100.  This was before wikipedia.  Perhaps a future dating system will number years as in BW before wiki and AW after wiki.  Anyway needless to say I recall quite clearly, his pediatrician FINALLY did a blood test as a last resort (celiac is not a profitable disease to treat, therefore rule out everything more profitable first) which had wildly high results, then refer to gastroenterologist who knocked him out and did an endoscopy, ""yup all inflamed and Fed up in there"" then trial run gluten free diet and his blood antibody numbers started dropping and he nearly instantly had a normal digestive system.  And like yourself he gets horrifically sick a couple hours after eating gluten containing foods and it lasts and closely resembles a very, very bad food poisoning incident (like to the point of dyhydration danger, and yes he has been poked with IVs in the ER for this).  So I donno about all this ""there's no tests"" this is extremely heavily trodden ground.  Your primary care doc might be pretty ignorant of this specific disease but I can't imagine a gastroenterologist being confused, this is after all kinda their bread -n- butter...<p>On the other hand I donno if you technically ""need"" a medical diagnosis.  I'll spare you the details, but shellfish and plain ole chicken eggs don't seem to be terribly well tolerated by my digestive system... solution? I don't eat them.  I don't need a trendy diet or diagnosis or a pill or celebrity endorsement, I just don't eat lobster or fried eggs.<p>Note that wheat provides approximately nothing valuable to your body other than empty calories, so feel free not to eat it.  Also almost all junk/highly processed foods are stuffed with wheat as a filler so your health will most likely dramatically improve if you stop eating wheat.  The reason trendy actresses feel better after stopping wheat is not the lack of wholegrain bread but the lack of twinkies, not the lack of soy sauce but the lack of an entire pan of lasagna in one sitting, etc.  Its not at all like giving up citrus or giving up meat where you have to put at least a minimal amount of care into making sure you don't end up with a major nutritional problem.<p>BTW his whole digestive system got messed up and he's also allergic to soy and milk casein proteins.  Supposedly if you ""tough it out"" for a couple decades you can get cancer from the constant inflamation.  Also his growth was pretty stunted until he got a proper diet (at which point he started growing so fast I swear you could watch him get taller).  So get this checked out.  I may not be a medical doctor, but it doesn't take a PHD to figure out if it makes you sick, don't eat it.",1361911400

After two weeks the pain and the nausea were gone, almost completely, and I'm still having some other GI issues that are being addressed. I don't think I am 'intolerant' to gluten, I think there is something wrong with my gut and avoiding gluten seems to be helping for now. Yes, it's becoming a fad, and it's sad that people just dismiss it simply because of that. Look at some of the comments here, it seems people get <i>angry</i> over it. However, it's been life changing for me, literally. I hope to eat wheat again when all my issues are sorted out, but it's really helped me for the time being.",1361911370

I think the overall tech culture sucks period, I don't think it's got nearly so much to do with sexism as you do. Like my example about the guy who mocks women speakers for being women -- and turns around and mocks another speaker for writing Java. That's a sex-related expression of general douchenuggetry.<p>Remember that time Yehuda Katz interrupted a speaker at a meetup, said everything the speaker said was bullshit, and took over his talk?

Instead of attacking identity and trying to change people, you show people who are already motivated (they want something) how to achieve their dreams. Nobody likes being lectured, but everybody wants to achieve something.<p>And, bonus, it's totally non-gendered you help both men and women with the same stroke.<p>(The downside is it's not as sensationalistic.

And the problem with weird allergic reactions is that antibiotics from the cephalosporins class or other medicine that produces allergic reactions can kill you.<p>Also, our doctor went basically blind for the whole time, because the blood tests you perform when the patient is under treatment are mostly useless, being used only to discover how well or not the patient is responding to treatment. For instance she discovered a bacterial infection, which is known to cause Lyle's syndrome, but was it an external infection that caused it or because of an imbalance of intestinal flora due to antibiotics? We also gave him antibiotics before hospitalizing him, that might have also caused this reaction. Lyle's syndrome is known to be caused by both antibiotics and bacterial infections.<p>The root cause in the case of Lyle's syndrome is extremely important because the treatment and severity of the reaction differs.

I can kind of picture the fourier transform meaning that there's only one representation but it's a bit of a leap for me. Can the converter itself not create the signal incorrectly?<p>Nyquist's theorem shows that you can reproduce a sine-wave, provided that you have <i>strictly greater than</i> two samples per cycle (and implicitly assume that you have a sine wave).<p><i>Any</i> periodic signal (which, for audio, which is AC-coupled, is always) can be represented <i>exactly</i> by it's Fourier transform.  The FT is simply a different representation of the same function, namely a sum of sine-waves.  In general the FT of a signal has many terms (i.e., many spectral components or harmonics).  However, in a band-limited system, only certain harmonics are allowed to pass.  If your audio system claims to have, say, 20Hz to 20kHz bandwidth, then any Fourier component outside that range will be greatly attenuated (if the attenuation puts that component below the noise floor, we could say that the component has been completely eliminated).  It is the act of attenuating those out-of-band components that causes the square wave to go squiggly.<p>This means that for any arbitrary signal which has been band-limited to half your sampling frequency, you can <i>exactly</i> reproduce the band-limited copy.<p>The sampling system <i>usually</i> (for consumer audio, <i>always</i>) has an anti-aliasing filter between the signal source and the sampler (<i>not</i> having an AA-filter is what allowed Tektronix sampling oscilloscopes to show multi-GHz signals in the 1960's, by effectively heterodyning the signal frequency down to something usable).  That means that the digitizer only ever sees the band-limited signal.  The bandwidth of the AA-filter is chosen so that the maximum frequency passed to the sampler is half (or less) than the sampling rate.<p>This also might help: <a href=""http://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/7879/how-does-subpixel-image-shifting-using-dft-really-work/7904#7904"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/7879/how-does-subpixe...</a><p>> Isn't there also an argument that frequencies above 19khz can be heard by some people so need to be accurately represented?<p>That argument has been put forward, yes.  ""Back in the day"" Bell Labs performed actual experiments with human test subjects to produce ""equal loudness"" curves.  The upshot is that the power of an audio source must increase as the fundamental tone rises (starting from about 4kHz, or so).  Then you must consider the effect of loud sounds on the human ear.  Hearing damage is cumulative and the rate of damage increases with sound power, so it's hard to put an exact upper bound on the upper power limit of human hearing.  However, at some point in the 18kHz to 22kHz range, the equal loudness curve crosses the damage curve.  At that point you have to turn up the power of the audio source so high that you damage your hearing listening to it: So there is a definite upper frequency limit to human hearing.  It may be slightly higher for some people than others, but 22.05kHz (the Nyquist limit for CD-rate sampling) is almost certainly greater than many standard deviations above the mean.<p>It's difficult to admit for a group of people (engineers and scientists) who are always striving to make things better, but we have come to a point where audio reproduction is ""good enough.""  For a modest amount of money, the sampling, storage and reproduction is for all intents and purposes ""perfect.""  Your living room is never going to sound like a concert hall with a live orchestra, but it's not because you don't have enough bits or samples or bandwidth.",1361909415

All of the comments about the ""federal"" or ""United States"" government in this thread apparently aren't based on reading the fine article. Moreover, the text of the proposed bill, ""A person is guilty of a class A misdemeanor if such person knowingly creates or assists in creating an image of the exterior of any residential dwelling in this state where such image is created by or with the assistance of a satellite, drone, or any device that is not supported by the ground. This prohibition shall not apply where the image does not reveal forms identifiable as human beings or man-made objects.

Reasonable minds could take either side of this bill, but don't react to the link-bait headline, but to the actual text of the bill and its context among current business practice and other legislation.<p>From the website's description of itself:<p>""About us & our story<p>""AGBeat is Business news, insights, tools, and inspiration for small business owners and professionals. AGBeat condenses news information on technology, business, small and medium business, NPOs, social media, startups, real estate, economics and more, so you dont have to.<p>""In 2007, AGBeat began as Agent/Genius (AG) . Fed up and disgusted with the pay to play real estate space, we decided to radically change the face of news publishing by giving industry professionals a legitimate voice.<p>""Successful to date in its fundamental mission, AG is a multi-award winning publication and its columnists and editors are named as some of the most influential in real estate, business, and in technology. AG is known for ripping the lid off of hot new technologies, startups, and mashups- everyone knows that if its on AG, its relevant.<p>""In late 2009, AG took on News and Business News, seeking to disrupt a drab and boring, and mostly pay to play business publishing space and continues to bring honest coverage and insight to an eager audience. Because of AGs footprint within the tech startup space and in the business category, we needed a way to expand our publication, and in 2011, we changed our masthead to AGBeat, launching a brand around Agent/Genius.""<p><a href=""http://agbeat.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agbeat.com/about/</a><p>Oh, so the link-bait headline comes from a group of real estate agents who want to spread alarm at their business actually being subjected to the rule of law.

I mean this whole analogy given by article poster is pointless first of all. And then comparing SFers with New Yorkers based on their road crossing habits is even more pointless. In developing countries (like India), where in most cities/towns there is no designated zebra stripe crossing (and definitely no push button pedestrian crossing signals),  every one crosses at their own terms, some times dodging medium sized vehicles, giving respect to large vehicles and stopping smaller vehicles(bicycles, bikes etc) by waving their hand as they cross over. From the street hawkers to the bankers, from a school going teen to the old man with walking stick, every one does that. How does that give you any insight into the psyche of a person !! Or the psyche of a geographical region?  New Yorkers cross on their terms more often possibly because there's just more people, lot of whom are in rush and ""crowd learns soon from the behavior of few""<p>Trying to glean any meaning from such behavior is a futile exercise.",1361908953

Start using Linux and get comfortable with the command shell, and all the unix programs. Get familiar with some programming oriented text editors like Vim or Sublime. Get familiar with the process of installing libraries and other systems on your own machine so you can set up a development environment that is usable. And most important of all. Learn how to use a version control system like Git or Mercurial or SVN.<p>once you've got a good feel for these tools you'll be able to start writing applications without shooting yourself in the foot. at this point you should just pick a type of application and do one.<p>for example you mentioned that you were interested in building a website. Javascript is a core technology for that but you'll also need to learn about HTTP and how the client/server model works. you'll need to learn more about the front-end technology stack (Javascript, HTML, CSS). you'll need to learn about how to interface with a datastore of some kind (probably a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL). you'll need to learn about server side languages (almost anything works but PHP, Python, and Ruby are the most popular right now) and will probably want to learn about a Web Framework written in one of those languages (like Rails for Ruby or Django for Python).<p>it sounds like alot, and it is, but you don't have to swallow it all at once. every application domain is going to be similarly complicated in its own unique ways, but there are good beginner entry points into each of them. (for example, the Django tutorial <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/</a>)<p>the important thing is to learn by doing. its not enough just to know the basics of how to write small programs in one or more languages. the complexity of application development comes at the integration level, where you are trying to get many functional components to work together and do what you want without bugs. there's no good way to learn this besides just practice. like any knowledge domain, its large and complicated and you can study it for years and still have just scratched the surface, but you've got to start somewhere and you'll learn more and more with every passing day. don't feel overwhelmed. just learn your tools and then start with a small project in your domain of choice.",1361908843

118791,comment,118748,118765,0,0,xirium,,,"There's a patent for storing a specific database structure in memory and therefore MySQL Server memory tables use a hash structure to avoid this patent. This would very well when you lookup a row which is present. However, the entire hash is enumerated when an row is not present. So, perversely, you'd get more performance with MyISAM, a RAID card and a big disk buffer.<p>You could use memcached. However, if you are developing REST web services, you can retrospectively introduce Squid without changing your code.",1203409626

So starting as a service to the people who can demand such info (investors) makes sense -- and if it works, <i>then</i> they can ""raise a fund themselves and beat the tar out of"" the old guard. That's how it usually works in finance -- prove yourself first in the service of others, then once you have a track record, run your own show.",1203409044

118777,comment,118017,118435,0,0,ChaitanyaSai,,,"What about a futures market that offers non-voting shares in startups (or Vegas-style wagers)? Startups relevant to the traded instruments can accrue some percentage of the option price. This gives you predictive power and funding. There must be some major pitfalls that I can think of, other than startups deliberately going belly up to cash out negative wagers :) \nOne aspect of Ycombinator is, I guess, that of a prediction market with people trading in early attention and uptake.",1203408048

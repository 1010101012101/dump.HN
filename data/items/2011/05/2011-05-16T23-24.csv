The fact that its possible to instantly share an entire folder with someone else.<p>Theres probably some way to do each of these with proper encryption. For point 3, maybe having a separate key for each folder, then giving others access to that key when you share.

There's a distinction in law between downloading in the sense of saving something to your hard disk and just having it in RAM. Obviously, if I go to your website and see something on my screen, I have 'downloaded' in some fashion, but if just passing through memory was considered a download then running a program or opening a file would be considered equivalent to making a copy.",1305587342

Obviously a privacy mode would be there, but people in small towns and neighborhoods used to do all sorts of stuff out on their front porches (maybe they still do in places), basically advertising to other people they knew that they are open to some conversation.  So there is at least a little reason to think people would turn on a ""my available friends live"" video channel.

I realize this is a charged issue where people have different ideas of how it should work, but for a certain set of goals (maximum coverage, minimum cost), Europe generally does much better than the US. Other things (diversity, productivity, entrepreneurship, I would argue) are done better in the US.<p>There are obvious and simple ways the patent system could be improved. For example, drug patents already are treated specially, in that they expire quickly--perhaps a similar system could be applied to software patents. Or, exemptions could be made for implementations of patented software that exist for reasons of interoperability or compatibility. Another option would be to enshrine into law the promises companies make not to sue. (As in, the company is not allowed to renege on their covenant not to sue--this is actually probably not really possible from a legal standpoint, but I'm not an expert.)",1305587035

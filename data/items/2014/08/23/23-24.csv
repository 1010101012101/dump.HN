8217168,comment,8216579,8216579,5,0,mike_hearn,,,"There&#x27;s a hidden surprise in store for people who think this is a neat trick to ensure their message lasts forever: there&#x27;s no guarantee it will work.<p>In future some nodes, probably many, will become &quot;pruning&quot; nodes. That means they&#x27;ll throw old blocks away and won&#x27;t be able to serve them anymore. It&#x27;s a popular misconception that it is technically necessary to store all blocks to run a fully functioning Bitcoin node. So long term storage and serving of the full chain will slowly start to migrate to more specialised archival nodes that have cheap bandwidth and storage to spare. At that point stuffing data into the block chain is not much different to just uploading it to a bunch of servers.<p>But even those nodes don&#x27;t have to store your data forever, for two reasons.<p>Firstly, although being able to reconstruct today&#x27;s ledger by replaying from day zero is a rather nice feature from an academic perspective, it&#x27;s not actually necessary for Bitcoin to function. Even if every archival node deleted some old blocks, all that&#x27;d mean is you had to start your node from a snapshot of the database taken at the earliest block time and  work from there. This means trusting the snapshot in some sense, but if many people have calculated that snapshot and attested to it (especially if they&#x27;ve done so in future blocks!), the practical security difference is quite small. Certainly it wouldn&#x27;t mean Bitcoin stopped working or anything.<p>And secondly, as Satoshi described in his original white paper, the way blocks are structured means transactions can be deleted <i>forever</i> and yet the chain can still be replayed, if none of the outputs of those transactions were ever spent. Given that outputs which store only files cannot be spent, it&#x27;s safe to both delete them from the UTXO set, and delete them from the archived blocks too (such a block would have to be sent using the partial merkle tree format already supported in the protocol). As long as identification of the outputs is reliable/conservative so there&#x27;s no chance of misidentifying a spendable output as unspendable, you don&#x27;t even need consensus to do this: just delete the guff from your local database and only serve blocks to nodes that understand partial block downloads, and you&#x27;re done. Of course it&#x27;s better if there is consensus, so perhaps some future version of Bitcoin will schedule certain transaction outputs for destruction as part of some other upgrade.",1408836297

8217162,comment,8216321,8216893,11,0,srean,,,"It is light years far from ideal. There are two variants of this much parroted line (i) Numpy, Scipy are just C loops, and (ii) &#x27;just do the intensive parts in C&#x27;, both leave a lot more to be desired.<p>Yes numpy, scipy indeed dispatch to precompiled C and sometimes Fortran loops but the problem lies elsewhere, in its vectorization paradigm. It is just extremely wasteful. There are two problems:<p>(a) it is not expressive enough to capture efficient computation without generating unnecessary intermediate arrays whose sole objective is to make it possible to write the computation as a vectorized operation. Unlike Matlab in the past, numpy, scipy are at least smart about broadcasting. This often allows one to avoid constructing those intermediates in memory. However, this comes at an extra indirection that affects <i>all</i> array operations via the stride vector. You pay the cost of indirection whether you need it or not.<p>(b) The second problem is generation of temporaries when you chain several binary operations. These temporaries get allocated, filled and destroyed over and over again within a single expression which itself might be in a loop. This costs computation, memory, not to mention GC pressure. There is of course numexpr but it is also quite limiting. For instance you cannot index or slice from within a numexpr expression. It offers limited set of reduce operations, in an expression you can use only one, and it must be the last one in the sequence of operations.<p>Then there is &#x27;write to C&#x27;. If we have not eliminated the need to write C we have not really solved the hard problems have we. I think the whole point was to avoid writing low level code because it is error prone, tedious and that it often comes at the cost of productivity. The drop down to C imposes an unnecessary break in flow and forces you to tackle the impedance mismatch. Tools like Cython eases this a bit. You cannot for example use numpy array expressions efficiently from Cython, you have to write those tedious low level indexing code. If I were to write C, I would rather write it in C syntax and take advantage of the decades of tooling around C syntax. Cython is great and an awesome community effort, but it still quite a simple compiler and has limitations.<p>So far I have been talking only about ease of use, quality of programming experience etc etc, but that is not the only issue here. The problem is calls to C and more importantly callbacks from C to Python are expensive enough to be non-ignorable. If you have a hot loop where you go back and forth between C/Fortran world and Python thats going to incur a serious hit. The solution is to make the containing piece of Code into C/Fortran/Cython, so it ends up swallowing more and more of the application logic, leaving only but a shell of I/O in the Python world.<p>Its not the end of the world but not quite the rosy picture you give. Another issue is cultural, its common among many newer programmers not to have really experienced fast runtimes, of course this is a generalization and does not apply to all, but have seen it happen frequently enough. They are greatly amazed by what I would call only modest improvement in runtimes and they would be cheering &quot;Wow! so speed much fast!&quot; etc.<p>All of these make me be really hopeful about Julia. Interacting with the community gives me the feeling that they get it. Julia is an expressive language, already quite performant and not saddled by limitations of vectorization. I do like the terseness of vectorized expressions over loops, this is being filled by devectorize.jl. Yes there are more libraries available in R or Scipy but given the ease with which one can code in Julia I dont see this to be an unsurmountable problem. Every language has to begin somewhere and unlike say other competing solutions like Torch7 I find the community very friendly, responsive and pragmatic. It seems they spend conscious effort to keep it that way. So, Julia community, here is wishing all the best.<p>I do love Python a lot, and I mean really really a whole lot (except for its OOP parts) but this self cheering gets a little too much at times.",1408836131

McCown et al. (2005) discovered that half of the URLs cited in D-Lib Magazine articles were no longer accessible 10 years after publication [the irony!], and other studies have shown link rot in academic literature to be even worse (Spinellis, 2003, Lawrence et al., 2001). Nelson and Allen (2002) examined link rot in digital libraries and found that about 3% of the objects were no longer accessible after one year.<p>>Bruce Schneier remarks that one friend experienced 50% linkrot in one of his pages over less than 9 years (not that the situation was any better in 1998), and that his own blog posts link to news articles that go dead in days; the Internet Archive has estimated the average lifespan of a Web page at 100 days. A Science study looked at articles in prestigious journals; they didn’t use many Internet links, but when they did, 2 years later ~13% were dead. The French company Linterweb studied external links on the French Wikipedia before setting up their cache of French external links, and found - back in 2008 - already 5% were dead. (The English Wikipedia has seen a 2010-2011 spike from a few thousand dead links to ~110,000 out of ~17.5m live links.) The dismal studies just go on and on and on (and on).

8217130,comment,8216639,8216639,1,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"Personally?<p>I think that most compilers should not compile to machine code. They should compile to an intermediate bytecode (only doing relatively generic optimizations), something like LLVM but with precondition / postcondition annotations. Call this phase 1. The operating system then takes that bytecode and on first-run (or at any other time if a program explicitly asks for it) compiles it to machine code, doing whole-program optimization, for the specific machine. Call this phase 2.<p>The phase 1 compiler may split functions into a version with the original semantics, and maybe versions that require preconditions / post-conditions. Say, a hashmap constructor that requires the size to be a prime (that throws an error otherwise) may get split into a version that checks if the size is a prime that falls through into a function that just assumes the size is a prime, with a precondition that the size is a prime. This can then be used by the phase 2 compiler when appropriate.<p>For public functions, the phase 2 compiler <i>may</i> decide to copy (a) functions from the shared library to the program itself if there is enough incentive to do so. Say, a function that does an expensive check that the compiler knows isn&#x27;t necessary, but the pass 1 compiler didn&#x27;t split it out. The phase 2 compiler saves information regarding what optimizations were done / useful, which can be passed back to the phase 1 compiler when appropriate.<p>(For cases where a compiler on the target device isn&#x27;t really appropriate, and/or the hardware of the target is fixed, you can cross-compile.

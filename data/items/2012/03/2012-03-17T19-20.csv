3718000,comment,3717715,3717715,41,0,scott_s,,,"I almost never write classes in Python. That may be a result of the fact that I never use Python for anything other than system automation and data post processing; I don't use Python to build complicated systems. What I have made use of are named tuples:<p><pre><code>  3DPoint = collections.namedtuple('3DPoint', ['x', 'y', 'z'])\n  p1 = 3DPoint(3, 2, 4)\n  p2 = 3DPoint(10, 1, 10)\n\n  dist = math.sqrt((p2.x - p1.x)**2 + \n                   (p2.y - p1.y)**2 + \n                   (p2.z - p1.z)**2)\n</code></pre>\nI don't mean to say that classes aren't useful in Python, just that I've gotten a lot done in the language just depending on hashes, lists, tuples, named tuples, functions, comprehensions and generators. I've never felt the need to define a a class - the closest I came, I realized I wanted a named tuple. It certainly would make sense in the above example to define ""dist"" as a member function of a 3DPoint class, but it's just not how I write code in Python.<p>Contrast this with C++, where I define classes all the time. I think the reason for this discrepancy is that if you want to do anything interesting in C++, you almost have to define a struct or a class; that's where most of the abstractions happen. In fact, if I want functional style code in C++, I have to define my functions as classes. I think that Python's native tuple types, first-class functions and comprehensions make the difference.",1332013983

In his Muffin example, he took out the instance variable that stored the API URL and created a constant out of it. If I had an URL for my staging environment, and another for my production environment, I'd like to programatically set that instead of going back into the code, modifying the constant value, run the test, and then change the value back to the original. That's just a bug waiting to happen.<p>This isn't to say his underlying message is wrong (I 100% agree with Jack's message, too much classes create unnecessary complexity in your library/app), but I don't want people destroying their classes without fully understanding the consequences.",1332013837

3717949,comment,3716948,3717902,93,0,Aloisius,,,"Which underlying algorithm?<p>The search engine was built on a ternary tree with a custom merging algorithm. I honestly don't know if the merging algorithm has a name as it was something I came up with (literally) while sleeping one night. Because we mostly used ID3 tags and file names, it was completely unnecessary to use a stemming algorithm because if you typed in a misspelled search, given the size of our index, there was probably someone who tagged their file using the same misspelling.<p>The network biasing code used BGP data combined from a number of looking glass servers to build a map of ip/prefix -> ASN number and ASN->ASN distances. It was then used to reorder search results based on network distance to users so they would bias towards their own networks and save ISPs money and speed transfers on broadband connections.<p>Servers were linked through a fully meshed network. Each had presence information about every user on the network so that they could route IMs around. The chat system was semi-linked (fully linked on some servers, but we couldn't fully link the whole thing because the client had no administrative functions for chat). If we couldn't send the user back enough results for a search, the query was simply passed around the backend.<p>The whole thing was written in C++. At its peak, there were about 2.3 million users online at any given time (80 million total users growing by a million every 4 days). The system would be indexing about 17.6 million files per second (and de-indexing about the same amount). The whole system pushed out about 2 Gbps of bandwidth in search results (which were tiny).<p>Napster was one of the very first services to push past 10K connections on a Linux machine. At peak, I could get over 100K users on a single process (though I'd run out of memory indexing files on the tiny 2 GB machines and blow out the NIC sending search results). During normal operations, each server process had around 40K users on it and between 7-12 million files indexed.<p>There were a bunch of side infrastructure things no one saw. Court mandated copyright filtering systems, recommender systems (most for play), load balancing servers, bot detection and sequestration systems, analytics reporting jobs, etc.<p>Nowadays, I could probably fit all of Napster on one big machine.

3717937,comment,3717114,3717540,2,0,cygx,,,"While in principle, Javascript's object system is prototypal, in practice you can use it as if it were class-based; in fact, before the addition of Object.create() with ES5, you only could get proper prototypal inheritance through non-standard extensions like __proto__ or a hack using temporary constructors.<p>There's no syntactic support for class-based inheritance, so it's a bit verbose, but not really complicated:<p><pre><code>  function AClass(foo) {\n      this.foo = foo;\n  }\n\n  // methods are shared between instances\n  AClass.prototype.alertFoo = function() {\n      alert(this.foo);\n  };\n\n  function ASubClass(foo, bar) {\n      // call parent constructor\n      AClass.call(this, foo);\n      this.bar = bar;\n  }\n\n  // simulate inheritance via method aggregation\n  for(var name in AClass.prototype) {\n      if(AClass.prototype.hasOwnProperty(name))\n          ASubClass.prototype[name] = AClass.prototype[name];\n  }\n\n  // alternatively, use proper inheritance\n  ASubClass.prototype = Object.create(AClass.prototype);\n\n  ASubClass.prototype.alertFooBar = function() {\n      alert(this.foo + ' ' + this.bar);\n  };\n</code></pre>\nThis is what I'd call the idiomatic way to implement classes in Javascript.<p>Instead of adding methods to the prototype, you can also add them to the instance within the constructor. This way, you can simulate private members as such methods close over the constructor's lexical scope -- but this comes with a performance penalty.<p>Most custom class implementations just provide sugar over these patterns.",1332012494

This worst-case scenario is a good indicator for how laggy and jittery a mobile OS will be at sporadic times throughout the day.<p>The point here though is that you have <i>less</i> overhead by focusing just on the web. Running a web browser on a normal mobile OS, as you mentioned, runs a browser stack on top of the normal OS. There is additional work there, for example, on Android to run the browser you also run the Dalvik VM, etc. And the underlying OS and userspace is optimized for native apps for that platform, not just for the browser.<p>B2G purposefully has just one VM - JavaScript - and just one native app - a web browser, and the underlying OS is optimized for running exactly that, not native Android apps or native iOS apps in addition to a web browser.<p>It's too early to say how the final result will be.

3717901,comment,3717754,3717754,31,0,tikhonj,,,"I use Emacs because it does everything, most of it well, and is absurdly easy to extend. I've found myself missing features several times; each time, it took maybe three or four lines of code and maybe ten minutes to add. Even adding basic support for a new language turned out to be easy, so Emacs is now the only editor that supports my own language at all :).<p>Additionally, Emacs has the best UX of any program I've ever used. It is, by far, the most unified and consistent program I've seen--the same commands I use for getting around a code buffer are used to get around directory listings, documentation, compiler output, shell output and so on. Since everything, including the UI, is basically text,I don't have to treat the content much differently from the editor. This makes doing all sorts of sometimes complicated tasks easy.<p>On top of this is has some incredibly awesome features.<p>I am literally addicted to TRAMP--if I want to open a remote file, I just enter the remote path as if it was a normal file path and it just works. I can also open remote shell buffers just as easily. This makes working on several different servers at a time just as easy as working on local files exclusively; people watching me often don't even realize that some of the stuff I'm doing is remote.<p>Org-mode is really great. For a simple, easy to learn outline editor it's extremely flexible. Using the same tool for notes, todos and even presentations is great.<p>I also use Emacs to manage many shells, the way others use GNU Screen. This integrates managing a bunch of potentially remote shells into my workflow really well.<p>It also has some really brilliant language-specific modes like AucTeX and JS-2. The normal Haskell (with some potential additions like Scion and ghc-mod, although I still haven't tried these) is also great.<p>I even use it for Jabber and IRC. This makes it easier to code and chat at the same time and gives me access to a lot of Emacs's great features. A very practical example is the TeX input mode. If I want to use random unicode symbols, I can enable an input mode that automatically translates \\lambda to λ and so on. This is also really useful for making some of my Haskell programs prettier :).<p>So really, the old saw about Emacs being an operating system is basically true--it can even view images and PDFs! Really, the main thing I do outside of Emacs is browse the internet, and I could even do that in there. However, the rest of the saying (that it just needs a decent text editor) is less true; while the default bindings are perhaps less powerful than Vi's, they're still extremely good and make for a much better editor than any I've used, including those that attempt to emulate Emacs bindings, which inevitably miss a good portion of the movement and editing commands I use regularly.<p>So yeah, Emacs is like magic.<p>EDIT: Oh yeah, with Emacs server and a relatively nice laptop, opening a new Emacs window literally takes a fraction of a second. In fact the minimal fade-in animation I have takes longer than actually launching it.",1332011615

3717888,comment,3714269,3717786,3,0,pron,,,"First, just a technical correction: pundits, like editors and and photojournalists, are journalists. The journalists whose job it is to report are reporters.<p>No journalist should lie, even pundits, and it is indeed a reporter's job to report rather than opine, or, as I prefer to call it, ""pass judgement"". However, even when reporting, and especially in long-form non-fiction pieces (be it a magazine feature or a documentary film) it is is the unintelligent reporter who limits his audience's perspective to the clearly observable facts. The camera, as the saying goes, truly does lie, if only because the viewer cannot see what lies beyond its field of view. The mere selection of which facts to report (as you cannot report all of them unless you want to turn your audience into reporters) is the first act of building a model of reality. A lie is indeed a lie, but sometimes just reporting a few facts is a bigger lie (i.e. a worse approximation of reality) than completing the picture with the experienced reporter's gut instinct.  It is not the reporter's job to pass judgment - that is indeed the realm of the pundit - but it is his job to reconstruct a good model of reality.<p>A reporter is not supposed to be merely a sensor, transcribing measurements. It is his job to try and extract meaning from those measurements as well; meaning, though not judgement. When you actually go out in the field, there is valuable meaning that you just sense even though you can't waive a piece of hard evidence to support it. A reporter that decides to spare that meaning from his audience betrays both his audience and the truth.<p>You might say, well, if that's the case, two reporters going out there might tell a very different story. That is true. That would also be true if both were simply reporting the hard facts. That would be true even if they both were to place a camera and let it stream images directly to your screen without any human intervention.",1332011467

3717875,comment,3716781,3717759,3,0,acabal,,,"Firefox is a special case.  Ubuntu specifically updates that one package more frequently.  Perhaps it was a bad example as that's one of the very few packages that is singled out for frequent updates by Canonical.<p>PPAs still aren't the best solution even if distros make them easy-to-use.  The reason is that now maintainers have to get their software into two places: the core repos and now an optional up-to-date PPA.  Additionally they must still target those PPAs to every single new version of the entire distro.  For example: I run Natty because I like Compiz, but Oneiric has showstopper Compiz bugs for my ATI card.  On Natty I use a PPA that downgrades the version of Compiz to a more stable one.  However that PPA has not published an update for Oneiric, so I can't upgrade to Oneiric and get other new packages.  What now?  My fate is in the hands of a single PPA maintainer.<p>Or: many PPAs only publish releases for the past 2 or 3 distro releases.  What if I'm on a non-LTS release and don't want to upgrade (because upgrading would bring in more unwanted packages), but the PPAs I use no longer publish for my version?  I'm out of the game again.<p>The core problem in these scenarios is the distro model.  Devs have to keep their apps up to date with the quickly-moving target of a ""distro.""  That's just not a situation anyone should be in.  The OP and the linked article explain this better than I can.",1332011301

This was primarily due to when I listened to it, which was during my late-morning commute.  I believe I was listening to ""All Things Considered,"" which is usually quite a good listen.<p>However, on certain subjects, I noticed what seemed to be a significant bias in the moderator.  Expressions of shock or disbelief at certain things, giving some speakers more time than others, and not calling some speakers on blatantly talking around the question, for example.<p>Last time I checked, I think I was evaluated as a mildly socialist libertarian.  I happen to know a fair amount about guns.  As such, I notice terrible inaccuracies and biased language fairly often when reading mainstream media reports on gun-related incidents.  The misuse of automatic, semi-automatic, ""assault rifle"" (which means ""scary looking"" to journalists), cache versus personal arsenal, etc.  It's really a lot like the low quality of technical and science coverage.  Basically, similar technical ineptitude leads journalists to appear right wing (e.g. climate change deniers) as what leads them to appear left-leaning (e.g. complete ignorance of gun terminology).<p>Other parts of NPR have a ridiculously narrow view of the world.  ""Wait Wait Don't Tell Me"" drives me mad with the narrowness of the comedy on there.  As it happens, much of their comedy would probably fall under the category of leftist, but I was personally offended by the narrowness and inanity of an apolitical joke (specifically, they were laughing at an experimental airbag for motorcyclists which protects the often-broken hips from impact with the gas tank, but the commentators repeatedly assumed it was solely to protect the groin, so they effectively made ""pee-pee"" jokes for five minutes).<p>Anyway, while I don't consider NPR to be a leftist news outlet, per se, I would appreciate if they spent more time educating themselves on certain subjects and tried harder to hold guests accountable for answering questions presented.",1332010820

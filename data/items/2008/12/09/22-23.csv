391975,comment,391774,391774,0,0,zmimon,,,"Since you mention eclipse I would say ""proceed with caution"".  There are two issues:<p>a) Eclipse itself is less usable and less stable.  I have colleagues who are unable to debug, experience crashes etc. which I never see on Linux / Windows.<p>b) probably you are doing java development.  Java itself has very weak commitment on the Mac and often lags years behind the latest releases and even then may have issues.  If you make your bread and butter doing Java stuff, you should probably run an evironment that natively has first class support for it.<p>Of course, if your Eclipse use is just incidental then these may not apply.",1228863510

So when I first switched I bought Parallels and installed XP.  For awhile I was running XP with FeedDemon (NetNewsWire has some annoying features I couldn't figure out how to turn off), Digsby, and a few other Windows-only apps I thought I couldn't find Mac replacements for.  Eventually, though, I found replacements for everything (save Word and Excel).<p>Plus, I can now use TextMate, which has made my like a lot easier.<p>I still own XP and Vista machines and use them fairly regularly as well.  But my main computer has become by MacBook.<p>I made out a list last month of all the things I love and hate about the Mac after a couple of months using it.

Doubly so when you're working with a team.<p>Programming in a team is hard in the same way that taking care of a room full of toddlers is hard -- obviously, you want everything out in the open, but you also want to hide the sharp objects, put caps over things that can shock, and otherwise make the big, transparent room as soft and bouncy as possible.  You need locks on the cabinets full of poisonous chemicals.  Obviously, the locks <i>need</i> to be open-able, but only in special situations, and certainly not by nosy toddlers.<p>(Before you criticize me for being paternalistic, realize that I include <i>myself</i> in the ""toddler"" category.  I much prefer code that's written in a defensive style, because it's easier for me to maintain later on -- and that's where any programmer spends the majority of his time.  I've developed this attitude because I know that I'm <i>stupid</i>, not because I'm arrogant.)",1228863198

I'm really big on productivity, so I really tried to customize every tool I've listed below. To give some background, the main programs I use are:<p>1. (<a href=""http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/04/09/launchers.html?page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/04/09/launchers.h...</a> ""Launchers - SlickRun vs QuickSilver + Butler/Launchbar"")<p>a) Ported all current bangs from SlickRun to QuickSilver.<p>b) Tried Butler, Launchbar to quickly launch artists, songs. Ended up sticking with Launchbar.<p>* SlickRun is marginally faster, minimalistic. Support different use cases.<p>* Felt frustrated in QuickSilver's scripting language trying to do simple stuff like ""Open new Window (not tab), ssh to this hostname.""<p>* Tie as I'm prejudiced.<p>2. Terminals - PuTTy + cygwin vs Visor + Terminal, iTerm, x11... + Gnu-darwin, fink<p>* I heavily abuse remote (Ubuntu) session screens to do all my work. (I'm usually a Rails dev using VIM.)<p>* Needed 256 colors, package manager, bright (as opposed to bold) colors. Prefer no tabs.<p>* I have no idea why the native Terminal program doesn't support 256 colors. Entirely silly.<p>* Package management is a pain. Ended up doing all my work on my remote Linux box.<p>* I really prefer PuTTy. Every single terminal program I used on OSX either didn't fit in visually or were missing some feature that was provided in PuTTy.<p>* Spent way too much time frustrated while trying out everything. At then end, still frustrated.<p>* I understand this might just be due to my prejudices, so tie.<p>3. Virtual desktops - VirtuaWin vs Spaces, Witch<p>* Spaces has huge numbers of problems. Especially when combined with CMD-TAB. Spent way too much time frustrated. Gonna give this one to Windows.<p>4. Browsers - Firefox vs Firefox.<p>* Lack of right click drag mouse gestures. Large drop in productivity I never managed to replace. Windows wins.<p>5. Music - Winamp vs iTunes.<p>* I really learned to hate iTunes. A lot. Ended up bugging out on my giant music library and crashing a ton for no reason. ... Spent even more time debugging/Googling. Frustrating.<p>* Tie, lots of people like iTunes. I prefer my Winamp + Python script to update m3us.<p>Every other program had a relatively easy replacement. Here are my other gripes:<p>6. Hardware - Right click.<p>* 'nuff said. Everyone trying to justify this design decision is probably a fanboy.<p>7. Keyboard shortcuts.<p>* Three months later, I'm completely used to the keyboard shortcuts and hate them passionately. Does anyone <i>honestly</i> like the Apple bindings better?<p>* They lie! Changing bindings for applications like Firefox in the ""control panel"" does not work at all. Another frustrated day.<p>Conclusion:<p>* If you spent a lot of time becoming proficient on your platform of choice, you probably can only lose on OS X.<p>* It is incredibly frustrating trying to make ""minor"" tweaks. They turn into massive battles that remind me of my days trying to tweak my Linux desktop box.<p>* If you aren't an efficiency freak like me, you might gain by switching.",1228862923

I see you use Adobe CS3 and MS Office, so you'll have to buy new licenses of each of these, unless you're running them in a VM.<p>I looked at moving to a Mac just like you are and after looking at the hardware and software costs, I could by myself a separate linux server as well as a new PC for about the same price as a Mac. You're also limiting yourself in the hardware you can buy by using a mac, no more upgrading the video card if you feel like it, or getting a $40 digital TV receiver, no more plugging in a RAID array on the weekend, the number of third party accessories is smaller and there a lot more expensive. Also the amount of free utilities for the Mac is a lot less (I use a bunch of little free PC utilities, that have seeped in over time, and would take a lot of time to replace). I have 2 monitors at the moment and thinking of getting a third - can the Mac support a third? not sure. There's a lot you take for granted in the PC world that you give up if you move to the Mac world. The Mac hardware is a closed proprietry system and all the negatives that come with that are there, but I do agree it's nice and shiny and I just want to touch them :-).<p>So I'm buying a little Mac laptop to play with (officially for the kids) and keeping my development on PC's.

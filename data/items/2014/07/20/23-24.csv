The trouble is that for a large torrent, there could be hundreds of peers each attempting to negotiate on the link, and that can cause problems. My experience is with experimenting with just about every QoS setting possible on a Cisco ASA hooked up to the cheapest Verizon DSL several years back- I haven&#x27;t bothered lately but that&#x27;s because my home pipe these days is thick enough to make it not matter.<p>BT would be a lot friendlier for traffic shaping if the tracker played a more active role in flow control, or if otherwise some distributed consensus was negotiated regarding wanting more unsolicited connections.",1405900797

8061958,comment,8061502,8061502,1,0,err4nt,,,"> Did you learn to program in school or teach yourself?<p>Self-taught. This stuff advances so quickly it&#x27;s tough to distill what you need to know into classes without getting REALLY deep into it. The pace of the industry is set by the speed at which the self-taught craftsmen research and develop new skills. It&#x27;s hard to find competitive pay if you don&#x27;t have competitive skills and in the long-term, only those skilled at self-teaching have any kind of longevity in the field IMO. I&#x27;m still young but I see so many ahead of me lose that edge and not be able to find work simply because they spend too much time doing and not enough time thinking.<p>> Did you do unpaid work to establish yourself?<p>Absolutely, but I have a strict policy of only working pro bono for myself or charities I would donate money to. I&#x27;m a big fan of open source code, so I try to donate as much as I can to posterity once a project is complete at well.<p>> Roughly how long did it take you from day 1 of learning to day 1 of being paid?<p>I have been tinkering for years while in school so that&#x27;s not a fair question, but more recently I have gone from not knowing JavaScript to getting paid to write bits of it here and there in one year while also doing other web development. It should take less than five years to go from nothing to competitive if you&#x27;re keen to do it, and you shouldn&#x27;t need to spend a dime to do it. There is enough material, software, and even full operating systems you can use for free so he only costs are a computer, electricity, and internet access. If you have those three already, buckle up and get ready for a wild ride, but put that wallet away!<p>> What Was Your First Gig?<p>My first job out of college was as an in-house web developer for an online tutoring company. They tutored adults to help them get professional certifications they would need to get a job. I ended up getting caught in a layoff within the first year unrelated to performance, but I still cherish the opportunity they were ready and trying to give to me even though it never bloomed to the full potential. I got a site built for them and they have been able to maintain it since then but I fear they are doing very well financially even still.<p>My advice to you is this: if you want to learn web languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, DONT look for tools that make it &#x27;easy&#x27;. At the end of the day you&#x27;re writing a page of text, so the most simple, easy, and straightforward way to arrive at that is by simply typing the characters. Any pre-processors, plugins, or frameworks that reduce what you have to write reduce what you are able to learn. I suggest starting with a &#x27;clean-room&#x27; approach and creating blank files and literally typing each and every character you want in those files manually, every. Single. Time.<p>When I start a new website, the first thing I type is: <!DOCTYPE html>, I don&#x27;t even start with a &#x27;empty template&#x27;. That&#x27;s the fastest, easiest way to &#x27;get into&#x27; a languages syntax and get your head around what it does.<p>Good luck!",1405900650
8061957,comment,8061592,8061921,3,0,pbsd,,,"The quantum scenario is not particularly applicable here. Generic preimage attacks on sponges are essentially collision-finding on the capacity. Grover does not beat classical algorithms at this; Brassard-Høyer-Tapp doesn&#x27;t either, if you take into account the full cost of the algorithm.<p>In any case, having a c = 512 ceiling for the capacity would put every attack at over 2^256 cost, which presumably is enough, and would keep the function reasonably fast. Note that c = 2n <i>would</i> have rivaled Skein and possibly BLAKE in terms of speed.<p>As for analysis, what matters is the analysis performed on the permutation.

Not only can you read more quickly than people can speak, but it&#x27;s also active by nature. I&#x27;ve often found my attention wandering during videos, but it&#x27;s just not possible to read without putting in a minimum amount of focus. It&#x27;s also a lot easier to modulate your reading speed based on how easy material is for you than it is to do the same during a lecture video.<p>Some general thoughts on MOOCs:<p>Coursera and edX tend to be great for small, self-contained topics and the automated graders for programming assignments is great as well. The forums are also useful, though not ideal (since there are no practice questions students can get help with that don&#x27;t fall under the honor code).<p>Where modern MOOCs really fall down is prerequisites. It&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to do something like structure an entire CS degree from Coursera classes. Though many classes are taught by famous CS professors, they are from different institutions that break material into courses in different ways. Worse still a lot of the classes are either watered-down or shortened or both.<p>MIT&#x27;s Open Courseware archives are actually a lot better for this. There are no certificates, and no credentials, but nearly all the material is freely available. The one biggest inefficiency though, is all the time spent in the lectures. At least they can be played back at a higher speed, but the lectures really do take a lot more time and cover less than the textbooks. For courses that have good textbooks, I think the best approach is to skip the lectures except in portions where you feel like you need more review.<p>Finally Khan Academy is fantastic for answering specific, mechanical questions (e.g. how to calculate eigen values), but a bit light on material.

8061855,comment,8061592,8061592,0,0,pbsd,,,"This was a manufactured controversy if I ever saw one. The controversial changes were proposed by the Keccak team sometime after Keccak was announced as the SHA-3 winner [1], and did not originate from NIST.<p>The idea was to decouple the security of the hash function from its output size, and have a single parameter determining its security (the capacity). At the moment, when you have a hash function, you expect to have 2^n (second-)preimage security and 2^(n/2) collision security, where n is the output size. In the case of sponges (and Keccak), the security level also depends on c, the capacity, which is a parameter that also happens to affect performance of the hash function.<p>To avoid generic preimage attacks, the capacity parameter in Keccak must be 4 times the size of the desired security level; for 128 bits of security we need c = 512, for 256 we need c = 1024. Achieving collision resistance requires smaller c, only 2 times the desired security level. This results in a very slow hash function at high security, more than twice as slow as SHA-512 on x86 chips.<p>So the proposal was to set c = 2n, where n is the security level. This puts the preimage resistance of Keccak at the same level as its collision resistance, i.e., 2^128 preimage security for a 256-bit output, and 2^256 security for a 512-bit hash. That is, the strengths of the 3 main properties of the hash function, preimage, second-preimage, and collision-resistance are all the same. This is not what is expected out of a perfect hash function, but this is very reasonable nonetheless, and the performance of Keccak is otherwise lacking.<p>After the leaks, however, there was a lot of attention focused on NIST and these changes to Keccak got confused with attempted backdooring. Much protesting ensued, and the decision ended up being reverted back to having a Keccak that has 512-bit preimage security at 512 bits of output, but is disappointingly slow.<p>[1] <a href=""http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/documents/Keccak-slides-at-NIST.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/documents/Keccak-s...</a> (Slide 47 onwards)",1405897943

Similar story for electronics. I did those things for fun while pursuing a mainstream math / science major in college.<p>At that time, at least in my region of the country, CS was almost exclusively data processing on mainframes. If you wanted to get into anything else, like scientific programming or microprocessors, you could do so just by being crazy enough to volunteer for a task. Many people bought their own computers and brought them to work, to bypass the computer bureaucracy.<p>A friend of mine was an electronics tech in a factory. They bought some sort of computerized test gadget. The boss asked if anybody wanted to learn how to program it. My friend was the only guy who stepped forward. I think he was interested in seeing if he could use it to run his model railroad. It launched a new career for him.<p>During college and grad school, I used any computer at hand for any task that I could come up with during summer internships or research projects. I found kindred spirits among the professors, who were doing the same sorts of things.<p>Many of those people were also ham radio enthusiasts, and it was a similar mind-set.<p>My experience didn&#x27;t lead to a programming gig per se, but my programming skill has probably helped my career greatly over the years.

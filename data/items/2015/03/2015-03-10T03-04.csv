It&#x27;s not like the MBA is heavy, thick or noisy. The retina screen is really nice but to me it doesn&#x27;t really look like a good deal.<p>Not saying it won&#x27;t be popular, I think it&#x27;ll be very. Just don&#x27;t see it being so interesting right now myself even if I had $100m to spend, there&#x27;s some big tradeoffs with this new MB.<p>Strangest thing to me wasn&#x27;t really the pricing fit, I think I would&#x27;ve done the same. But that we ended up with an &#x27;Air&#x27; line that&#x27;s heavier, bigger, thicker and noisier, and hell better performing, than the regular MB line.

You generally don&#x27;t have the desire/funds to pursue people who violate the contract, and it&#x27;s often difficult to prove anything.<p>Large/smart companies will also realize that they have all the power, and they&#x27;ll include upper limits to the damages they have to pay. One of my companies was recently, egregiously ripped off by one of the 3 largest insurance companies in the world, and they had capped their liability at $100k. Fortunately, there was easy-to-prove malice, so they will end up having to pay us some day.<p>If you&#x27;re the one signing the NDA and the other party is large and powerful, you actually could be successfully sued.<p>So in short: NDAs are powerful when you have the resources to back them up with lawsuits. As a developer, I&#x27;ve signed NDAs and non-competes for many small-to-medium businesses, and I&#x27;ve never been tempted to violate them, so I can&#x27;t attest to the validity of that situation.",1425959540

9175836,comment,9172605,9174914,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Agreed. If we look at PCs I think we can conclude the vast majority of them were bought, rather than put together with separate parts by consumers. And that&#x27;s an extremely modular system. I built all my own computers since I was a kid and while I&#x27;ve been tech-savvy, I&#x27;m very far from a hardcore tech guy especially when younger. It was just so easy, installing most things is as easy as plugging a charger in a socket or screwing some bolts in. Yet, while you could easily save several hundred dollars by doing it and build it to your liking, a minority of consumers did in the past 15 years.<p>This notion that we&#x27;d all suddenly want to do that for phones seems to me perhaps a little bit unfounded.<p>Especially when you consider that there was 0 engineering involved in building your own custom computer from different parts (unless you took a deep dive into custom cooling rigs or mini towers). i.e. you generally bought a mid sized tower and put in your parts. Space was barely a concern and there weren&#x27;t any space related tradeoffs.<p>On mobile devices however, space is everything. Bigger screen? Won&#x27;t fit in the pocket, or it&#x27;ll be too heavy, and it&#x27;ll draw more power. Bigger battery? Less space for the CPU or storage, or a camera module.<p>Not only are companies (with this being their core competency) generally better equipped to make these decisions, but they&#x27;re also much better equipped to minimize the tradeoffs. They can engineer a camera module and a bigger battery, not just by engineering a better camera/battery module separately, but by engineering them to fit into a smaller space <i>together</i>. All the soldering-type stuff I like to complain about has, beyond business reasons, genuine engineering reasons, too.<p>Add to that the fact that smartphones aren&#x27;t quite a fashion statement (in the way that creating a modular smartphone would be like choosing what clothes to wear), but are in a way a reputational statement (in that people do like thin, slick looking phones), I don&#x27;t see how modular phones can really take off, with few people caring that you can customize them for fashion, and most people preferring the non-modular phone that&#x27;s as thin and slick as you can get, because it&#x27;s all soldered on and sitting in a unibody.<p>And none of this is unique. We tend to prefer the completely designed experience. We don&#x27;t want to buy separate pieces and construct our own chair or table or our cars.<p>Modularity feels like creating pages from different books and turning it into a story. You don&#x27;t get the same cohesion. Or going to the golden corral and ordering pasta, a steak, sushi and pie. It doesn&#x27;t make a good meal no matter how good the individual pieces. A properly designed course around a set of ingredients or a theme is always better, especially when curated by professionals.<p>Does that mean we don&#x27;t want choice or can&#x27;t handle it? No. I just think that we find modularity, in a very loose sense of the word, in the product offering. All the different phone manufacturers ARE the modularisation and personalisation of the smartphone. Hell Samsung alone has put out 200 phones.<p>Many vendors do, and quite a few of them experiment. e.g. the phablet was a big experiment that saw a market demand. We&#x27;ve seen battery powerhouses. We&#x27;ve seen tiny-bezel phones with a large chin. We&#x27;ve seen phones with an insane amount of megapixels on the camera, phones built for selfies, phones with a curved display, phones that integrate with digital covers etc.<p>So the choice is really there.<p>In the end I think the flagship products are so well designed that the need for tradeoffs will diminish. In some ways we&#x27;re already there. Phones have a good enough camera for everything except professional work. Phones come with storage we see on laptops. We&#x27;ve cheapish &#x27;unlimited&#x27; data plans. We see insane resolution screens. We see all day battery life.<p>In short, when I buy a flagship phone, I don&#x27;t really think &#x27;damn wish I could switch out the iPhone camera for more storage, could do it if only my phone were modular&#x27;. Battery is still a big point of improvement for me, a tradeoff, but that&#x27;s about it. It feels by the time Ara could pick up steam, the tradeoffs, like battery, are likely so small (ever more efficient chips, mostly) we probably won&#x27;t have a big enough demand for different phone configs for different times, enough that we&#x27;re willing to pay extra for the different extra units, and bear the reduced performance and form factor that a modular system offers over a single fully designed experience.<p>At the end of the day phones are becoming able to do everything, and the personalisation of the phone is all in the software (apps, themes, content), the choice of phone (again, lots of experimentation and catering to niche markets by vendors) and things like cases. I don&#x27;t really see modularity becoming a big part of that.<p>That having been said, I love that I&#x27;ve been using my PC for 7 years, switching components every now and then. It&#x27;s a pleasure. It&#x27;d be awesome to see how far modular phones could go. It might be one of those things that somehow just works so well and sticks, even if it&#x27;s not the best system on paper, like say tcp/ip. Looking forward to ara going live for consumers this year.",1425958119

I personally tried 25 minute sitting work + walking for 5 minutes (which actually increases productivity when you stop staring at the screen without a break).",1425957836

The Allies, the US in particular, were not interested in negotiating peace with Japan. They were not willing to settle for anything less than Japan&#x27;s total submission to them, which is why they ignored Japan&#x27;s overtures to negotiating peace in January 1945. Not, as you naively seem to be believe, because they were &quot;concerned with not seeing another world war&quot;, but because the US realised it had the might to do so, and wanted to assert itself as a global military power. Negotiating with Japan would have implied that the US had doubts about their own capacity to wage war. You seem to be aware of this, as you point out in your other comment that was linked to earlier:<p>> Japan counted on the vast distance between San Fransisco and Tokyo to protect them from the horrors that they had unleashed on China, the Philippians and countless other peoples in the Southeastern Pacific.

I really hope everyone will say it&#x27;s crazy, though, because the consequences are pretty dire.<p>Advertising is good at selling some products, but advertisers are spectacular at selling advertising. So we&#x27;ve had almost a century-long bubble in bullshit.<p>The best way you outsell other advertisers, masters of bullshit themselves, all spinning how effective their ad is, is by selling metrics alongside your advertising. Metrics are the anti-bullshit. Well, almost...<p>You want something that looks like &quot;actual sales caused.&quot; You want to tell a guy, &quot;pay me $10 per ad, and I will generate 10 sales, each giving you $2 profit you wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise made. We&#x27;ll split the winnings.&quot;<p>You want to claim metrics for sales caused, but you don&#x27;t really want those exact numbers, you kind of want something that looks hard that you can spin. Something loosely correlated with &quot;actual sales caused&quot; where your art of bullshitting can get slightly better returns than the exact numbers would get. Play to your strengths, right?<p>So magazines come along with subscription numbers, and that&#x27;s great sauce. Then television comes along with the Nielsen family and, ok, actually Nielsen starts way back with radio in the 1920s, but same idea. Radio/television advertising reaches the most people and every company starts to pay a premium.<p>Advertisers have the whole industry sliced, diced, catalogued and formulated. Superbowl is the premium end, free weeklies are the bottom of the barrel. Everybody has a place, but everyone&#x27;s using the same game to guess at eyeballs, to guess at actual sales caused.<p>Suddenly, though, there&#x27;s this new game on the internet. Not a lot of eyeballs at first, so it starts in free weekly category. Suddenly though, Google (and maybe some other companies) can tell you how many ads are actually getting action rather than just eyeballs.<p>It&#x27;s a metric like we&#x27;ve never seen before, it&#x27;s the killer metric. Sure, you could get this from surveys, or test markets, but this is like measuring everyone who sees the ad. It&#x27;s pretty cool.<p>But remember, metrics this accurate are dangerous, it shows when advertising doesn&#x27;t work too.<p>And a lot of advertising is spin, a lot of it isn&#x27;t all that great, because advertisers are better at selling ads than they are at selling your product.<p>I hope someone tells me this is all nonsense, though, because if it&#x27;s true, then Internet advertising is both absorbing the advertising industry then destroying it.<p>That&#x27;d be sad.

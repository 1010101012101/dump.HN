43562,comment,43534,43534,0,0,pg,,,"Editors edit submission titles for two reasons:<p>1. To keep the site clean (no spelling mistakes, gratuitously long titles, SHOUTING!!!, etc.)<p>2. To keep titles fairly neutral. People have a right to say what they want in comments, but because a story can only be submitted once, if we didn't edit submission titles, the first submitter could put whatever spin on the story, and all readers would have to read it as that.",1187377113

I don't understand how this happens. PG says we're changing focus and all of a sudden people start linking and upvoting different stories??<p>How is this more interesting to hackers than startup news. I don't understand how a rather top-down decree has changed the output of a definitively democratic system.",1187376333
43558,comment,43407,43407,0,0,adamdoupe,,,"I disagree with both of his points. <p>For the first, it is convenient to automatically search for all of your aim buddies instead of having to do so manually. Of course I'd only do this on a site that I trust (Facebook is one example). It adds value for the users. Plus it is purely optional.<p>Secondly, while I can see that some people might find these email alerts annoying, I feel they are quite useful. Adds a bit of clutter to the inbox, but it allows me to keep up-to-date with the goings on. However, there is a link on the emails to change what types of alerts they send you.<p>These are my thoughts on these points from the Facebook perspective.  ",1187375831

43552,comment,43260,43381,0,0,jsnx,,,"Are you implying that my reaction to genetic determinism is just a result of my uncritical acceptance of liberal, academic mores?<p>Personally, I think racism is more socially acceptable than most of us would like to admit. I've met people who left research in biotech because the ubermensch mentality was so pervasive there.<p>There is little evidence that social behaviours are transmitted genetically -- but you need only examine the history of Buddhist monasticism to realize that social behaviours can be transmitted, with extreme uniformity, in the absence of consanguinity. Why do people fall back on genetic determinism? It has a lot to do, I think, with logical positivism -- something that is very attractive to academics of every persuasion, except those close enough to its roots (physicists) to understand its limitations.",1187375057

Sure, that app owner has amassed all these users but these users are not his! He has no relationship with them so the value that he's trying to sell is heavily discounted.",1187374139

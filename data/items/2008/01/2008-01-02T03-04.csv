94221,comment,94022,94022,0,0,Zuider,,,"Nice article, but it's not exactly news. Adam Smith discovered spontaneous order. He recognised that it was a counter-intuitive idea - we expect that any order we find has been brought about through 'intelligent design'  or in Smith's  own words the 'invisible hand' 
Charles Darwin openly acknowledged his debt to Adam Smith.",1199244519

While the UK and US government probably have ""more powerful"" systems than this which are used for classified purposes, those are likely to be special-purpose designs which aren't able to run the linpack benchmark.  (For example, the NSA has access to wafer fabrication facilities, and is believed to have several custom silicon designs.)<p>The linpack benchmark runs on general-purpose supercomputers, and non-classified supercomputers shared between a large number of researchers are inherently general-purpose supercomputers.",1199243581

(How would the browser know if it was a pseudodiv or a new tag? Possibly DOCTYPE, but that as a switch has had a varied history, which is one of the reasons for HTML5's <!DOCTYPE html>.)

799832,comment,799344,799764,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"it's not just that.  I've known quite a few of this archetype and the thing they all have in common is tenacity.  they're always on the clock with one girl or another.  cast a wide net seems to be the strategy.  I think anyone can do this it's just that most aren't willing to put that much effort into casual sex.  casual sex quite honestly isn't worth a lot of effort.<p>edit: it's also worth noting that in my experience this type has low self esteem and the constant need for sex is a form of ego affirmation.",1251887635
799831,comment,799558,799819,0,0,hnhg,,,"I thought tsally was saying that women have equal access to Wikipedia, which should be enough - the lack of voting rights is all about denying equality to women from the outset. I don't think tsally's saying he or she is in favour of that.<p>There's clearly a problem with women being put off Wikipedia and I'd love to know why(your reason sounds plausible but I'd like a proper study to be made to find out all the different factors). I'd like to know if it's the same across different countries and cultures. It's a little disturbing to think that so few women are contributing to Wikipedia.",1251887560
799830,comment,799558,799819,0,0,tsally,,,"I wasn't confrontational, I just asked in what way you felt that Wikipedia was preventing women from contributing.  I also pointed out that Wikipedia editors are not people of large influence and not having enough women editors is unlikely to have a societal impact.  And now suddenly we're talking about male dominance, women's suffrage, and archetypes.  That's a pretty big leap.<p>I'm actually a feminist.  But people like you are just as problematic as misogynistic males.    Let me just give you a brief list of things to think about.<p>* We don't need a 50/50 split of women and men in everything.<p>* Men and women are different and not inherently equal in every which way (this goes both directions).<p>* Making ridiculous claims and accusations just hurts the cause.  Note how quick you were to accuse me.<p>* Picking your battles is important and Wikipedia editing is probably not an important battle.<p>I have a hard enough time arguing for women without irrational behavior making it harder.  If my comment made you ""speechless"" you're probably going more harm to feminism than good.  You're making it hard for the average person to take seriously.<p>And no, for the record I have never made an edit on Wikipedia.",1251887545

799826,comment,799494,799731,0,0,amastilovic,,,"Macedonians have never been at war with Serbia. We have traditionally been allies, mostly because we share the same orthodox religion. I will assume you have limited knowledge of what really happened in Balkans in the end of 20th century, so I can only recommend reading some independent sources.<p>I also recommend actually being in a war and then reading about it in the media. You would be surprised how biased CNN, Fox and BBC were during the NATO campaign in Kosovo (well, maybe not so much surprised by CNN and Fox). I personally was greatly disappointed by the BBC - I viewed them as one of the rare media telling <i>mostly</i> truth, but it turned out the BBC way of supporting official British politics was turning the blind eye to all bad things that were being done by Muslims in Kosovo.<p>And also, in near future you will get to see what kind of regime NATO was defending in Kosovo.<p>As far as F-117 is concerned, funny thing is how in Serbia we were watching Discovery channel's praising ""documentaries"" about that aircraft, telling (years after 1999) how it has never been shot down by the enemy. Well go to Belgrade and you can see it displayed, you don't even need a visa for Serbia.<p>Western media is a great war machine, much greater than some ""invisible aircraft"". And you miked, are either a part of that machine, or a foolish follower of their praise.",1251887264

It's actually time travel. 100 years ago men were saying using the same arguments about the right to vote for women..<p>Contributing to Wikipedia is a constant fight, that's why women don't participate. You contribute something and almost immediately your stuff gets deleted unless you engage in some tedious ""discussion"" why it shouldn't get deleted.<p>No wonder women don't contribute in such a hostile atmosphere.<p>Are you a regular Wikipedia contributor?

I've sat on them twice, gotten hit in the face with a basketball several times, and they still bounce back to their original shape. They weren't cheap (about $350) but they will definitely last until my vision changes enough to need new lenses - which aren't even scratched because of some protective coating.

799812,comment,799623,799623,0,0,scottjackson,,,"I guess Merlin's argument taken to the extreme is that Apple should wait until every piece of software written for a Macintosh computer is SL-compatible before they release Snow Leopard? ""Well, I don't want to go that far -- I just want the apps that I <i>use</i> to be compatible"", you might say. That's not fair unless you consider all of the apps that <i>everyone</i> uses and wait for those to be compatible. Very quickly we get closer to needing every app to be working again.<p>Upgrades can be bumpy. I lost a Dashboard widget that I use a lot (and didn't get upgraded until today), a few Preference Panes are a bit buggy, and my Safari plugins are totally f'd (since Safari64 can't load 32-bit plugins, I believe. I could be wrong, though -- ask John Siracusa). Yes, Merlin probably shouldn't have had TextMate and Photoshop crash on him. But at the same time, this <i>is</i> point-oh software -- I guess that in 2009, that means we should take it with a grain of salt.<p>By the by: I can't imagine that Apple releasing Snow Leopard a month ahead of schedule was a good thing for developers ( == 1 less month to Snow Leopard-proof their applications). I wonder if that is a contributing factor to the mountain of problems that people are having.",1251886143

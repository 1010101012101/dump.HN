But I've always liked Objective-C (although how Brad ""superdistribution"" Cox ever thought it made sense to try and sell a proprietary compiler when g++ was free is beyond me but I digress).<p>If this thing really works and does a good job of encapsulating the browser-specific stuff, I'll definitely use it.",1212720449

How can it not result in higher salaries for the programmers that live here?<p>I understand there is an argument which states that if companies can't find programmers here they will go to them by offshoring their work.  But there is nothing to prevent that from happening now.  If 10's of thousands of programmers are being turned away there must be some benefit to actually being on US soil.",1212719119

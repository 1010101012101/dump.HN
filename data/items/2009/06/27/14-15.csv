676895,comment,676590,676816,0,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>try online dating, seriously, even if only to meet interesting people and hone your social skills</i><p>OK Cupid is used this way.  I also knew a young woman who regarded online dates as ""dating practice.""  (She was an avid martial arts practitioner.)  If you regard the online dates as just practice, this relieves a lot of the pressure and focuses your attention in a way likely to improve your presentation.<p>About social skydiving -- I did stuff like that when I turned 27.  If you psych yourself up, be confident, act like this happens all of the time, you can literally get 100's of phone numbers.  Don't expect most of those to pan out, however.  I found only about 10% of those were defunct or bogus numbers.  But a majority of the remaining were not interested in me enough for me to get a date.  Still, if you can keep your confidence up, you will get dates.  If you can manage to genuinely have fun with your dates, then it will also lead to other things.<p>Keep in mind: you are doing sales.  Expect a 90%+ failure rate.  Pay attention to how your audience reacts.  Make adjustments.  Always be positive and cordial.  Always keep your confidence up.  Always believe that the universe wants you to experience happiness and beauty too.<p>Don't keep your confidence up by psyching yourself up with a sense of ""entitlement.""  This can work.  You can observe lots of guys working off of this.  Unfortunately, it can turn you into an asshole and lead to big regrets.<p>One tip: if you and a beautiful woman keep ending up in the same places, she will sometimes warm up to you even if she seems frosty at first.  But don't test that more than about 3 times with the same woman.  Be cordial, positive, and after 3 meetings, move on.  (Some of the best sex I ever had resulted from a circumstance like this.  Caution: use condoms.)",1246114519

The protocol most people (try) to follow here is a natural result from that.<p>I have a policy of only downmodding posts that are not a part of legitimate discussion. This includes obvious trolls, but also any post where I don't think the post contributes anything, such as an ad-hominem attack.<p>I do not downmod a post just because I disagree with it. If I disagree with the post, but it's not an obvious troll or incendiary in any way, I leave it alone. I see downmodding as a means to keep discussions civil, not to show disapproval with a point of view.<p>In contrast, I upmod posts I agree with. This means that a single control - voting up or down - has an asymmetric meaning for me.",1246114168

The history of micro-optimization is replete with myths and legends which sound juuuuuuust plausible enough to be true (or were true a decade ago) and endure to this day.<p>I'm currently involved in a project at work which requires translating a (Java) coding standards document.  I have filed probably two dozen bugs against the document that sound like ""The rationale for standard 2.4.3 is translated correctly from the Japanese but contrary to technical fact.""  They include my personal favorite Java performance tip ""Don't use the nice readable str + str syntax to concatenate, instead, use StringBuilder.""",1246114013
676889,comment,676770,676822,0,0,blhack,,,"This is something I see frequently brought up; concerns for safety on cheaper airlines, that is.<p>I can't speak for Europe, but in the United States, we have the FAA that pretty much dictates how safe the planes are.  Flying a ""discount"" airline couldn't be any less safe than flying one of the majors because the FAA is dictating how they take care of the planes.",1246113772
676888,comment,676056,676748,0,0,thras,,,"Insulin is tied up in fat metabolism and is a necessary molecule to move FFAs into fat cells. Inject a person with insulin and they'll gain weight fast. The rates of the growth of many types of cancer seem to increase in the presence of insulin.<p>Straining insulin production facilities may not be the real issue, as most people over-produce insulin (in response to all the high-GI carbohydrate they've eaten over their lifetime). A bigger problem is insulin insensitivity, which leads to high insulin levels.<p>Yes, insulin ""natural"" but that's no argument. Fever is a natural response of the body too, but high fever can kill you.<p>Now maybe the problem is what is called ""low-GI."" Stuff with GIs around 10 aren't that harmful. Green vegetables mainly. But get up to 30-50 (low-GI range) and you're nearly to white bread.<p>The best advice, in the absence of better studies than we've got is probably: eat like your ancestors evolved to eat. They didn't have any of this crap. They didn't have breads or pastas. They didn't have vegetables like potatoes or corn. They ate a good amount of meat, a reasonable amount of green vegetables, nuts, and berries once or twice a year when they could get them.",1246113381

Stand up straight, look people in the eye, act confident, and trust that even if you don't know, you can find out.<p>This advice is probably millenia old. Still good.<p>If you want to learn more, you might want to start with something like How to Win Friends & Influence People. It's old and cheesy but 100% accurate nonetheless (good history lesson too). It's <i>always</i> about the other person's experience, and not about you.<p>A great modern book is ""The Hard Truth about Soft Skills.""<p>There are several books on body language itself, but they typically don't have more information than the OP article, and then are filled with excessively speculative/suspiciously detailed interpretations of other things.<p>Perhaps the most important thing for hacker-types to learn is that your body language, attitude, behavior isn't about other people judging <i>you</i> - but <i>you</i> showing how you judge <i>them</i> by the effort you put into your appearance and attitude for them. You put effort into it == you respect them. It's just that simple.<p>The second most important thing to know is that there is no true way to detect if somebody is lying or insincere, and lots of those body language books argue that there is. Gut instincts are real, and when people lieÂ they often believe what they are saying anyway, so you gotta listen to your gut and not try to analyze if their eyes looked up and to the left or their eyebrows quirked, or if they covered their mouth with their hand.

676878,comment,676770,676804,0,0,seertaak,,,"> I think the LCC hacked the public in to thinking travelling like cattle is good<p>Your comment appears light-hearted so I don't want to come down too strongly, but I must say I detect more than a whiff of elitism in this sentence. The public didn't need any ""hacking"" or manipulation; they don't fly these airlines because they ""like travelling like cattle"" (again, I detect a whiff of disdain for the ""cattle-like"" public), they fly these airlines <i>in spite</i> of that fact, because they're much cheaper.<p>> When they travel like cattle on the London Underground they all complain!<p>Again, light-hearted, but in juxtaposing these two sentences you're implying that the public is inconsistent in its criticism of the London Underground (although one wonders if the LCCs are so successful at ""hacking"" the public, why can't the LU tear a page out of their machiavellian book?). But there is indeed no inconsistency; the two examples are simply not comparable. A single fare on the LU costs around Â£5, this for a median travel distance of perhaps a few klicks. The scenario is, shall we say, somewhat different for LCCs! In addition, people use the LU to get to work; and being subjected to ""cattle-like"" circumstances on a daily basis is, again, a different kettle of fish from having to endure a 2 hours of mild discomfort in order to enjoy a couple of weeks in the sun once a year.<p>> You can tell I'm a mac user can't you ;)<p>You might want to consider whether it is <i>you</i> who's been ""hacked"" into paying a substantial premium for an equivalent product ;)",1246112303

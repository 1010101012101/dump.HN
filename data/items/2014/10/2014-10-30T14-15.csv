My first exposure to the term &quot;lesbian&quot; was a flash cartoon that had a throwaway gag about a butch woman who lived in the sewer and ate children—I remember going home and crying because I strongly suspected that that&#x27;s what I was, once the other kids explained what the term meant, and I didn&#x27;t want to end up having to move underground and away from all my friends once I grew up. (This is hilarious in retrospect, but at the time I was really distressed.)<p>It&#x27;s really good that young gay people to have so many prominent and positive role models now, and easy access to information on the subject via the internet.

I didn&#x27;t get all of it, but it seemed to me that his definition tries to figure out what&#x27;s included or excluded in conscious systems and how conscious they are. It may or may not be right, but it at least it&#x27;s working towards something with predictive value.<p>The examples you gave are mostly abstract and not physical. If consciousness is a physical phenomenon, these algorithms must be manifest before they can qualify. As for the game of life, the pieces on a physical board aren&#x27;t actually interacting with each other with feedback loops. In a computer, the circuits are mostly feed forward and the algorithm is simulated rather than physically realized.",1414681041

The ExaLINK Fusion performs conventional layer 2 switching at approximately 110 nanoseconds latency and layer 1.5 switching at 100 nanoseconds, significantly faster than any existing switching device. The ExaLINK Fusion preserves the sub-five nanosecond layer 1 switching fabric and related capabilities of its industry leading ExaLINK 50 device, and adds layer 2 switching functionality implemented within a Xilinx Ultrascale FPGA. The layer 1 switching fabric is used as a central connection point for front panel line cards and internal application-specific modules.",1414681006

It hasn&#x27;t been everywhere, but it certainly has been global.<p>In many ways it seemed to have very high hurdles. Homosexuality and queerness elicits an unexplainably intense anger in some people. It is potently threatening. On the other hand, overcoming homophobia had a relatively small hurdle to get over because there was no intergenerational complexity like racism and xenophobia or deeply rooted structural institutions like sexism.  Homosexuals were already everywhere in secret. A homosexual didn&#x27;t need to overcome to become CEO, he was already a CEO. He just needed to come out.<p>A part of the precess that I think is happening now nearer the cutting edge is post revolutionary normalization. After the gay parades and overt homosexuality that forced the issue into centre stage what is needed is a homosexuality that can be worn lightly outside of the spheres were it is naturally central (like romantic relationships).<p>Tim Cook is gay, but he&#x27;s mostly the CEO of Apple. His gayness is not the central part of his public identity and not being public about it up till now is not being closeted.<p>It&#x27;s really a great thing that happened, and is happening. I&#x27;m glad to be part of the generation that made it happened, a gift to those who will come after, to those who will not have to suffer.",1414680906

The additional money the setup is making over a conventional cell (literally) buys you some maintenance options that are harder to justify for a solar cell that starts out more expensive than natural gas.<p>I&#x27;ve got my own questions about their claimed efficiency, but the good news is that solar efficiency is pretty easy to directly measure, so I can just sit back and wait for their customers to work out what&#x27;s going on.

Dual Universes.<p>I came up with this idea when thinking about dark matter and antimatter. I seem to understand that dark matter is more plentiful away from planetary bodies. When thinking about the big bang, the mathematics/physics that governed the forming of galaxies, stars, planets, black holes, etc, seem to indicate a desire of a certain &quot;order&quot;.<p>What if another universe somehow broke into this one, and all the matter in it spewed forth as a different type of matter into ours? Perhaps that matter seeks to find it&#x27;s original origin, perhaps in the form of a black hole back into that other universe. (discounting the blackhole/whitehole theory), but since black holes are fairly rare, in the mean-time, that matter seeks to gather until it can pass that point of no return to become a black hole.<p>In essence my idea is that gravity is a byproduct of matter seeking to return to it&#x27;s antimatter state in another universe.<p>Lots of unfounded hypothesis there, so forgive me if I&#x27;ve gone off the deep end with that one.

It&#x27;s just an opinion - isn&#x27;t that what democracies are for?<p>Marriage comes with specific rights and obligations (like, presumably most controversial, adoption and &quot;importing&quot; spouses into the country). Somehow society makes rules for who gets those rights and obligations. Would you say for example everybody should have the right to import people into the country? For example why don&#x27;t I get the right to bestow citizenship onto people whom I really like - do I need to fuck them to prove I love them? Isn&#x27;t that discriminatory?

Why can&#x27;t I just marry them all?<p>Maybe it would be fair if every citizen would get the license to bring n people into the country, no matter if married or not?<p>Again, I am not against gay marriage, I just want to demonstrate that there can be aspects that can be argued about.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about adoption to comment. Can everybody adopt children? Or do you have to prove you are a healthy couple, or wealthy enough, or whatever?

I was reasonably smart, well-spoken, curious, and so on, and I wanted to do something important with my life. Some nagging part of me suspected I was gay from very early on, but I resisted it intensely. I wasn&#x27;t really afraid of being mistreated, although I probably should have been. People were already calling me names so I wasn&#x27;t worried about that. More important for me was my sense that being gay meant being marginal.<p>There hasn&#x27;t been a gay President, and at least when I was a child there weren&#x27;t many gay people visible to me at all. The image of gay people presented to me were not powerful, focused on frivolous things, and consumed by attitude and lifestyle. If I wanted to do something important, I couldn&#x27;t possibly be gay. It just didn&#x27;t fit.<p>Knowing that the CEO of not only the most powerful company, but also the most admirable company, is gay would have helped me enormously. I always wanted apple products even before I could afford them, and this would have meant a clearly visible path forward. I can&#x27;t imagine how happy this must be making some confused young people, given how happy it&#x27;s making me right now.",1414677934

I&#x27;ve been rusting heavily for about a week (doing Matasano crypto challenges) and I&#x27;m still puzzled at lifetime errors.<p>Managing lifetimes is hard to reason about (though this is not a problem with Rust, but with lifetimes... Rust just makes it explicit.)<p>As soon as you start using generics things can quickly get out of control. Here&#x27;s one of my function signatures:<p><pre><code>    pub fn xor_together<&#x27;a, &#x27;b, &#x27;r, A, B, R, T, U>(iter_a: T, iter_b: U) -> Map<&#x27;r, (&&#x27;a A, &&#x27;b B), R, Zip<T, U>>
        where A: BitXor<B, R>,
              T: Iterator<&&#x27;a A>,
              U: Iterator<&&#x27;b B>
</code></pre>
If you get those lifetimes wrong, the error propagates and you end up having lifetime errors farther in your call chain, which are quite hard to debug. I&#x27;m not even sure those lifetimes are 100% right.<p>Some other weird things include closures. There are several types of closures, not interchangeable with each other (nor with fn) and honestly I don&#x27;t understand them (and couldn&#x27;t find docs to explain them). I hope this changes as Rust stabilizes.<p>I&#x27;m loving it so far, but boy... how hard it is.",1414677872

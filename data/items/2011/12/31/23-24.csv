Because of the limitations of C++ copy constructors and operators, my only option is to expose a virtual method (call it ""copy""). The non-smelly semantics we want are such that if you call ""copy"" on an object, you get an identical copy of the same type.""</i><p>Well, yeah...because those semantics are just as smelly as the one you described before.  What you describe isn't a copy constructor at all, and trying to make a copy constructor do what you want is a dangerous thing. A ""constructor"" that takes any subclass of class A and returns an instance of that subclass is inherently brittle: add a new subclass of A, and you've got to update the ""constructor"" to know about the new type.  On top of that, your ""constructor"" has to introspect into the type to determine what to initialize when, and that's slow.<p>There are easy ways to get the behavior your want (e.g. make a template function that calls the appropriate class' copy constructor, or -- closest to what you want -- make a template copy constructor function on the class itself), but complaining that you can't make a bog-standard copy constructor do polymorphic construction kind of misses the point.<p>Here's a better discussion of the problem than I have the space to go into here:<p><a href=""http://www.jaggersoft.com/pubs/oload24.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jaggersoft.com/pubs/oload24.html</a>",1325375643

3412231,comment,3411799,3412121,0,0,rogerbinns,,,"There was a poxy operating system a few years ago.  It only ran on one 32 bit architecture, didn't have multi-processing, had limited device support and a rather bizarre set of dev tools.  Then they tidied things up a bit.  But when they added multi-processing these morons just used a single big kernel lock.  What a bunch of idiots.  Obviously anyone using that operating system was blind and stupid and there were far better solutions.<p>That operating system is Linux.  It started out very simple and was good enough for many people and then kept evolving.  Nowadays the alternatives are mainly footnotes in history.<p>MongoDB is also simple.  Its locking approach does not give wrong answers.  Its users are happy.  Your assertion that the locking can't evolve is bollocks because you have no clue how the database works.  While your statement has many elements of truth for a relational database, it is meaningless for the current generation of schemaless/NoSQL databases.  Did you know that MongoDB has auto-sharding and replication, and doesn't need locks for that either?",1325375040

Never run out of gas because there's always a gas station nearby (and I don't let it get that low anyways). I check my tires about 4 times a year, and I pay attention while driving.<p>On the other hand, when I visit a city with public transit it usually makes me very uncomfortable. Is the station open when I need to go? Do I need tokens or a card? Will the vending machine take credit cards? Will I just miss barely the train and be late to my meeting? Will the train be late because some dude got stuck in the door (this happened to me in London)? Is that shady looking fellow at the other end of the car going to mug or knife me? What if the engineer is texting, misses a crucial signal and plows into the back of a stopped train?<p>Each mode of transit has its plusses and minuses.

3412201,comment,3411973,3411973,0,0,foxit,,,"Disclaimer: I'm a vacation rental owner who advertises on nearly all the mentioned sites, and before that I was a customer who stayed at vacation rentals.<p>One of the worst travel mishaps is accidentally double-booking a space.  This is something that happened with frequency in the old old days - prior to the rise of large hotel chains - often enough that it is a plot device often seen in books and old movies.  The protagonist finds they have to quickly arrange another place to stay, hijinks ensue.<p>Since hotel chains have come along, double-booking has become almost unheard of.  They have many identical rooms, they're overbooked counting on people not showing up, as airlines do.  But with this slight reversion (people are sick of generic hotels with little character and few amenities; the rush to stay in houses and apartments commences) the nightmare of double-booking is a possibility for the traveler once again.<p>On reviews via the vacation rental sites:  Nobody is happy with the current review system at the vacation rental sites.  Nobody.  Search the <a href=""http://community.homeaway.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.homeaway.com</a> forums to see the owners' side of this.  The owners feel HomeAway is geared far too much toward helping the guests, who aren't the ones paying big bucks to use the site.  The guests feel the company isn't allowing their voice to be heard when there's a true problem.  As in this instance, good guests find they can't properly review a property.  And good owners find they can't stop a wayward review from appearing on the listing they paid a lot of money upfront for.  Both ends of this are exploited by the few bad apples - the owners and guests who lie for their own ends.<p>Yelp's model of reviews, on the other hand, has its own similar problems.  Fair reviews by genuinely happy or pissed off customers end up filtered.  Unfair, spammy reviews (whether owner plants or one pissed customer writing 12 reviews) don't get filtered.  There is no 100% way to get around this.  The companies whose websites accept, review, and host these reviews have to do the best they can, and keep working at perfecting the filtering mechanisms.<p>Having said all that, I think the author has a right to be pissed off.  Finding you have no place to stay because the owner made a mistake is a nightmare.  And he should be able to say to others looking at the property that the owner made a mistake and double-booked him (but paid him back on the spot - obviously, situations exist where the owner gets snippy and refuses: new level of nightmare).  The fact that he can't state this publicly is a fault in HA's review system.  But they also have a point - that's all he could say, because all that happened was that his space was double-booked.  He didn't actually stay there.<p>What's the solution?  I don't know.  In a matter of dispute, a dispute resolution where an agreed upon statement of fact could be posted in the reviews might work.  The place this idea would fall down is when dealing with the true psychos - the liars who are out to take your money (on the owning side), the liars who are out to threaten you into giving their money back (on the guest side).",1325374502

My team is located in Africa, Europe, and North America, and we work closely with ops people located in the US and Asia (Singapore, India), as well as people in other parts of the company in a number of other timezones.  I believe more than half of the Mozilla workforce is remote from an office.  This includes places like Portland OR which has more than 10 Mozillians, but no office.<p>Some riders:\n- We work <i>hard</i> at being remote friendly.  We all spend all day in IRC.  We put people's timezones in the phonebook.  We make extensive use of IRC, the phone, Skype, teleconferences, Vidyo, email, Bugzilla, wikis, and etherpad.  We get together throughout the year - sometimes a couple of people, sometimes just our team, sometimes our group, sometimes the whole company, sometimes at an office, sometimes at a brewpub or cafe, sometimes at a conference.\n- We actively screen for remote suitability when interviewing people who want to be remote.\n- If people are in a country where we have an office they are employees, if they are in a country where we don't they are FT contractors (""geo-contractors"") but we treat them like employees in every other respect.

But this fact doesn't invalidate the vegan's goal of trying to reduce (what they see as) evil as much as possible.<p>In short, the attempt to find <i>every</i> bad thing or trying to pick out the <i>most</i> bad thing is an impediment to ever making anything better.",1325372836

9708814,comment,9707170,9708690,0,0,garrettr_,,,"There are several ways to resolve this issue:<p>1. Get a separate certificate for each subdomain. Let&#x27;s Encrypt makes this feasible since the certs are free and require a minimum of human overhead to obtain.<p>2. Get a single certificate that covers each subdomain by using Subject Alternative Names, which are currently supported by Let&#x27;s Encrypt.<p>3. Get a wildcard certificate for &quot;*.xyz.com&quot;. Let&#x27;s Encrypt does not support this and I do not think it plans to, at least not in the initial release.<p>The main question is - is the set of subdomains known before-hand, or is it highly dynamic? If it is fairly stable, then options 1 or 2 will work well for you; otherwise, you probably want option 3.<p>Choosing between option 1 and 2 usually depends on the details of your infrastructure and your threat model. For example, are all these subdomains served from the same server or different servers? If it&#x27;s the same server, you might be more inclined to use 1 cert for all of them (option 2) since it will be easier to manage. Do all the domains have the same threat model? For example, what if you run blog.xyz.com on one server and billing.xyz.com on a separate, hardened server. In that case, you would want option 1 because if you used the same cert on both servers, obtaining the private key from the less-secured blog.xyz.com server could be used to attack traffic for billing.xyz.com.",1434146203

This is useful for early exit, and mutable state dependency between iterations.

Yes you <i>can</i> machine most shapes that you&#x27;d want, and you&#x27;d probably end up with a nicer result. But it&#x27;s far more difficult, expensive and time consuming.<p>1. You have to manually do all the work, or at least set up tool paths which is a pain (and good software for this is even rarer than good solid modelling software).<p>2. You can&#x27;t do as complicated shapes. I&#x27;m not talking fractals, I mean can you mill a plastic latch as easily as I can 3D print one? No way.<p>3. It just takes longer. Once I&#x27;ve done my CAD with 3D printing the work is basically done. With machining it&#x27;s only just beginning.<p>4. If I make a mistake in my model and have to make a change, it is extremely quick to just do the modifications and reprint it.<p>5. If I want more than one of them I just click print again.<p>You&#x27;re right that good 3D printers are still quite expensive (FDM ones aren&#x27;t really worth it, but there are SLA printers for a few grand now). However good milling machines cost a similar amount, and CNC milling machines cost more.<p>The image problem with 3D printers is because all the cool and <i>actually</i> useful uses are one-off and in companies so they don&#x27;t get talked about as much trinkets and jewellery.

Religion constantly transforms itself to fit the world as science describes it.<p>So does science.<p>>Heck, the earth use to be the center of the universe according to religion.<p>That&#x27;s a gross simplification. See: Ptolemy and Nicolaus Copernicus.<p>It was actually &quot;common knowledge&quot; in the scientific community that the Earth <i>was</i> the center of the universe. The popularized issue between Galileo and the Catholic Church (and not just &quot;religion&quot;) was largely political. The Catholic Church, to retain power, could not be <i>wrong</i> about anything. If they had been teaching (with scientific backing even!) that the Earth was the center of the universe. That was how it must be.<p>Galileo wanted to educated people outside of the scientific community that the Earth was not the center. So he had to be silenced, else the Church would be wrong and may lose power.<p>As early as 300~ B.C.E , there is a reference from Archemedes&#x27; book &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot; of a heliocentric system described by Aristarchus of Samos.

For example, you can cook pasta with water - at the end of the cooking you just throw the water away. Water has been so inexpensive it makes sense to pour it right on to the ground to make plants grow.<p>Now, water is getting a little harder to come by. It still makes sense to cook pasta with it, because very little is used. But perhaps it&#x27;s not so useful to pour it on the ground for every type of plant. Perhaps there are certain strains or varieties that aren&#x27;t quite so water intensive. I know this is true for tomatoes.<p>So essentially you give up on the very water intensive kinds of plants, let the competition grow those where there is more water.<p>That&#x27;s a simplification, some things, like orchards take years and years to become productive. In those cases, perhaps it makes sense to pipe in water, desalinate ocean water, or whatever. Competition isn&#x27;t going to pick up the slack, because it takes years and years to get productive.<p>Food needs to be inexpensive, and readily available, subsidies absolutely make sense to make food inexpensive.

It is well known that certain laptops tend to work better with Linux than others, in fact Im running Fedora on a Lenovo right now and it works great.  So, is the desktop really irrelevant?  Depends, different distros have different priorities.  To date, Linux on the desktop has not shown mainstream appeal, but it does seem to gain more and more users every year.  If you really insist on being obtuse regarding the reasons for poor Linux desktop support, the primary answer is that Linux has a long history of being a very good server OS.  Security, stability, speed, price and customization are all reasons that is true.  There is limited time in the day, and so one thing must be prioritized over another.  Most linux distros choose to prioritize server development over the desktop experience, because that is where their primary user base is.  Other teams made different choices.  Why, at the start of this year, I tried to install various Windows versions on my rack server using a USB drive. Only Windows Server 2012 worked. Why is this?

I thought it was neat (I&#x27;m using -not- TransOver for the moment).<p>Here&#x27;s what I can think of, off the top of my head, but first some background:<p>I&#x27;m acquiring Spanish right now and simultaneously scratching the surface of German, Russian, Hebrew, and Persian. They have a lower priority, but I&#x27;m making progress.<p>As you may have noticed, English is not my first language. I learned it out of necessity (resources I needed were in English).<p>I read a lot, and in the beginning, my head hurt as I read stuff written in English. I had MediaDico on my computer to translate from English to French.<p>I struggled with idioms (I needed to read several examples of an idiom to get the gist of it)... But I can pin-point the exact moment where my learning was about to soar: I was in the living room and I decided that my computer experience had to shift to English. This means that even when I was to search for stuff, I&#x27;d do it in English. My brain bled. Something trivial to search for in a language I knew, something I already had the keywords ready, not in my mind but in my fingertips, to search Google for, would take me way longer to think about, formulate, and come up with keywords for, in English.<p>What would be cool is this:<p>- A user doesn&#x27;t have to click on on a word to translate it. The extension makes a sort of histogram of the most used words or expressions (a frequency list of the page), and automatically translates them. Since they&#x27;re the most used words or expressions on the page, the person will be exposed to them often: &quot;accidentally on purpose&quot; rote repetition. This will be useful for the next step:<p>- The extension _remembers_ (keeps a list of) which words (should) already have been learned by the user (which words he has been exposed to the most), and in subsequent pages will display them in the target language without the user doing anything. They will no longer be displayed in the user&#x27;s language.<p>- The first message it displayed was that I had to drag some link, etc.. Why is that?<p>- I had a message saying &quot;This is a very large page&quot;. Maybe the extension can translate stuff the user is most likely to see first, and as the user browses, it does stuff..

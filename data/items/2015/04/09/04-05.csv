For studies that we want to generalize to all humans, a sample of at least 100,000 is ideal.<p>- This is not longitudinal or experimental data. We have no idea if we&#x27;re just seeing a random correlation or not. There are simply too many variables to control for, especially with such a small population.<p>- Only people 47 to 59 were studied, and the questionnaire was administered in the present. We don&#x27;t know what their sleep patterns have been in the past.<p>- The groups were self-reported, which likely caused problems.

Sun Workstations were favored by scientists and engineers, however Sun&#x27;s real money came from enterprise servers.<p>Right around that time, Smalltalk was largely used for enterprise applications.  Enterprise application developers loved Smalltalk absolutely to death however the bean counters and the PHBs were more inclined to listen to marketdroids promises about garbage collection being immune to memory leaks.<p>Garbage collection and memory leaks are orthogonal.",1428554754

Actually, they go pseudoextinct. The animals do fine, they interbreed with the general canine population and their descendants are mutts. If you&#x27;ve ever met a dog, they&#x27;re quite OK with that. They have no concept of &quot;breed&quot; as far as we can tell and, if they do, they probably find mixed-breed animals more attractive (not that dogs are selective in that regard). We should be OK with it, too. Mutts live 2-3 years longer and are, unless you&#x27;re after a specific aesthetic or breed profile, generally better dogs.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind, honestly, if the practice of breeding animals for profit went extinct. We have too many good animals who are killed in shelters for no good reason. (We should stop that too, preferring TNR, but one issue at a time.) That&#x27;s far more heartbreaking than the possibility that some weird-looking creature that wouldn&#x27;t exist in nature and requires almost cruel human interventions (see: English Bulldogs, who now require C-sections) will not have descendants, or will have descendants of a more hybrid nature (pseudoextinction).<p>I think that dog breed is such a thing because of confirmation bias. So many people say, &quot;oh, I got a French Bulldog and she&#x27;s the sweetest thing ever&quot; or &quot;my Golden is smarter than I am&quot; and I&#x27;m sure that they do have great dogs... but I have awesome cats and they&#x27;re just regular mutt cats.

If it does, it is certainly not presenting them in this legal brief. In that case, something is very wrong with our legal system, because then things like facts and coherent logic have a value of about ε, and that&#x27;s harmful. And if that&#x27;s the case, then you are right that it is not exactly fair to hold the ESA to what they&#x27;ve put down here, as though it&#x27;s a position paper. But if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening, then to make that excuse for them (especially when they have not, as far as I know, written down the &#x27;real argument&#x27; anywhere else) feels an awful lot like supporting a broken legal system, which I don&#x27;t want to do.<p>I did think of your point as I was typing up my earlier response, however I decided I don&#x27;t care. A legal brief and a position paper are not the same thing, but they should be correlated. And by &#x27;correlated&#x27; I don&#x27;t just mean that they share the same conclusion - they should be based on roughly the same reasoning. I know that you&#x27;re sort of just supposed to use whatever tactics you can to win, and I recognize there is some value to having a system where the goal is to <i>win</i> rather than <i>arrive at the truth</i>. But if that system encourages twisting the facts to the point that you&#x27;re basically just lying, then it goes too far. And I&#x27;m not going to encourage that by making the excuse &quot;oh well they&#x27;re lawyers so what did you expect&quot;. I demand better.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, while I do think our legal system has a great many problems, I don&#x27;t think it is <i>quite</i> so bad as to support this hypothesis. I think the ESA has presented a poor argument because their position is poorly supported. I think they have twisted the facts and omitted other ones because they know this. I believe they are using these deceitful and deceptive tactics not because they are trying to support a reasonable cause within an unreasonable system, but because they trying to support an unreasonable cause within a framework that is, for all its faults, still sometimes capable for recognizing such bullshit for what it is.",1428552597

Otherwise, <em>the work done to enable that revenue to be booked is part of the profit-generating business</em>.

(sounds a little high to me at first but i guess that&#x27;s only $75k/yr for 26 years of retirement, assuming you dont make any money on investments). So if one wants to provide for themselves and a spouse, that&#x27;s $4 million. Moderately fancy homes in very expensive areas can be around $5 million. So $10 million would provide for two people and a nice house in an expensive area (we havent accounted for children yet but somehow i bet you could get by on $10 million, after all, most people do). We havent yet accounted for taxes (income taxes on the initial payment (~50% including federal and state?), and also ongoing property tax on the house), so lets say $25 million, which is the threshold used by <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9337915"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9337915</a> . This sounds like a lot but \nmy sense is that for the threshold number youd rather overshoot than undershoot, and some people may have more expensive tastes than others; in fact it may even be too low.<p>$25 million is not that far off from the $50 million threshold used by <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9337837"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9337837</a> .<p>So, what do others (not Andrew) think; would $25 million or so be a good threshold to use if one were actually doing this?",1428552077

The spectrum between stupid and crazy enough to work is an especially muddy one. It's easy to snipe at people, but in the end someone with their nuts on the line pushing a crazy idea has, at least, stepped up.<p>So if such a person wants to pitch a co-founder and hopefully make some magic happen, I'm not of the mind to criticize.

1749622,comment,1749363,1749363,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"As someone who has often cheered Lessig's opposition to the status quo, I am greatly puzzled by this piece.<p><i>Did Zuckerberg breach his contract? Maybe, for which the damages are more like $650, not $65 million. Did he steal a trade secret? Absolutely not. Did he steal any other “property”? Absolutely not—the code for Facebook was his, and the “idea” of a social network is not a patent. It wasn’t justice that gave the twins $65 million; it was the fear of a random and inefficient system of law.</i><p>If we take Lessig's factual assertions about the originality of the code as face value, it still seems as if Zuckerberg ripped off a lot of ideas that were shared in confidence, and repeatedly deceived the originators of those ideas into thinking that he was working diligently on their behalf.<p>I can't understand Lessig's criticism of the system as stated. It is not as if these ideas were found by Zuckerberg on a Usenet forum or overheard on the bus, and the Winkelvoss twins then went after him with an army of copyright lawyers; some sort of proposal was followed by some sort of agreement, and Zuckerberg was given access to the fundamentals of a business plan and the existing work product of two other programmers. Perhaps Zuckerberg had already had a vision for Facebook and simply accelerated his schedule in order to get it to market first; but if so, one wonders why he was wasting time on taking meetings for programming jobs.<p>What does Lessig consider the twins should have done instead? Would he be on their side if they had drafted a proper contract, NDAs, and stamped everything they ever put on paper with the words 'Property of ConnectU, hands off'? Or is it that he doesn't consider their idea sufficiently distinctive to be protectable by the legal system? Because he never articulates quite what he means, I'm left with the impression that Lessig considers the commons to extend to any exchange of an incomplete or unrealized idea, without regard for the context in which that exchange takes place. By this interpretation, the notion of a 'gentleman's agreement' is obsolete, what you own is limited to what you can control, and any lapse in total secrecy is your loss to bear.<p>Indeed, I saw this view expressed repeatedly during the fuss over the iPhone prototype earlier this year. Many considered the finder of the device the new owner, regardless of his legal obligations and his knowledge of exactly who had lost it. The value the finder, and subsequently Gizmodo, sought to derive from their possession of it stemmed from the very confidentiality and general unavailability of such prototypes. But many considered possession to be fully equivalent to ownership (on a moral if not a legal level), conferring the right to exploit what one possessed to the fullest extent possible. Quite why legal technicalities of a search warrant issued shortly afterwards should have offended their sensibilities so greatly, I can't say - they certainly weren't bothered by any statutory considerations, so it must have been to do with some inexcusable lapse of style by the police.<p>If we are not bound to respect each other's property or confidence by anything less than our full contractual agreement, does Lessig then see progress as the outcome of an arms race between zero-sum competitors? Why should I not steal his car if he steps out of it and leaves his keys in the ignition, and place the blame upon 'the system' if Lessig summons a policeman to his aid? The value of his car stems from its current configuration as a vehicle, and Lessig is arguing that designs do not belong to anyone in particular. the materials which make up the car - some steel, rubber and various kinds of plastic - are mere commodities, and at most I have laid hands upon some junk which just happens to be organized into the shape of a vehicle at present. If I drive it away and wrap it around a tree, what has Lessig lost? With enough time and ingenuity, he could reassemble the wreckage into a working automobile: others have done no less, so why does he feel entitled to have his idea of a car actualized at someone else's expense, just because it existed independently in the recent past?<p><i>You don’t even have to possess Zuckerberg’s technical genius to develop your own idea for the Internet today. Websites across the developing world deliver high quality coding to complement the very best ideas from anywhere.</i><p>Unless, of course, they decide to launch against you as a competitor instead, in which case you had best resign yourself to basking in the reflections of their glory.<p>Given the midnight byline on the post, I cannot help wondering if this was written with the assistance of a post-premiere cocktail.

Consider the possibility that his MS experience is with an organization that, in part, competed on features, and MS essentially won the battle.  One then at first concludes that it has the features that people want.<p>Compare that to the automobile safety discussion of decades ago.  Automobile executives and marketers concluded, at least publicly, that ""Safety doesn't sell"".  However these days safety is a big part of the sales pitch.  What has changed?  Well, perhaps nothing has changed other than the thinking at the top of the auto companies.<p>As useful as Joel's 80/20 argument is, I am having some trouble holding that thought in my head (that is that a feature-laden word processor is what people really want) at the same time as Patrick's observation that most of his paying customers see his program as just another part of Google.<p>I think it would be useful to drill down into these concepts a little further.",1285990331

One was the emergence of competing frameworks like Django and Pylons. The other was to work hard on other product  lifecycle stories. Some of which were influenced by what was gaining traction elsewhere (automated deployments, TDD). But, some new things also took flight in the Python world, like WSGI, which inspired similar endeavours (Rack, Plack/Perl).<p>Also, Python has better overall ecosystem. You want libraries for obscure (say HVAC)  protocol, you have a better chance of finding it in Python, than in Ruby.<p>I think more developers relate to ""don't be too clever"" attitude taken by python than admitted among this crowd.<p>While RoR was busy redefining the entire Ruby ecosystem in it's own image, Python people were busy building stuff that were truly framework agnostic.

1749589,comment,1746340,1747094,0,0,Goladus,,,"Example: the sysinternals tools for windows were originally distributed as single compiled binaries, and this was far and away the best approach for those tools.  Also, just because developers used installers on windows doesn't mean some of them weren't making a boneheaded design decision to do it that way and their app would have been more sensibly distributed as a single binary.<p>A single, statically-linked binary was (and probably still is, though .NET may be better now) the most portable way to distribute a program on windows.  You can't expect perl to be there, you can't expect python or ruby to be there.  Java was usually there but not trustworthy.  Java version conflicts on windows are a nightmare.  That's probably improved unless you're a business running legacy apps.  Dlls were difficult to manage and library conflicts were common: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_hell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_hell</a>.<p>Yes, you could use an installer, but that was unnecessary overhead if your application was not sufficiently complex.  On windows, you want to be able to say ""download this, click on it, and when the gui pops up: have fun.""<p>This is not true on Unix.  On unix, a simple perl script is likely to be far more portable than a single binary.  Python and ruby are reliable as well.  C source code is as portable (or more portable in some cases) than any of the above, though installation is more complex.  Also, many of the utilities that would be convenient as downloadable binaries come standard with the OS (grep, find, awk, vi).  Unix package managers are powerful and useful, and developers can trust that typical unix users understand them well enough to use them.",1285989047

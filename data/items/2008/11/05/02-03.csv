I would be very keen, however, to hear people who have been using the ideas outlined in the long-term. There are no quick wins in promotion, because you have thousands of other people against you, and getting people's attention is hard.<p>One downside to your particular situation is that your app is both soccer related and relating to reasonably competitive matches (that is, not just a kick around, but actually ""organizing players"" and the like). In this case, I'd say your app is <i>so</i> specific to a certain demographic that you need to narrow in on that demographic very tightly and focus on it alone. You're less likely to find your ideal market in general areas online and on highly specific forums, Facebook groups, real life, etc.",1225853917

354121,comment,353264,353455,0,0,yters,,,"There are two main pieces to our perception of the world - the bare facts and the larger picture you get from combining the facts.  The larger picture is more universal than the bare facts, so it is more useful than a use case.<p>Plus, and this is often ignored today, big pictures are not entirely mutually exclusive.  To use a comp sci analogy let's look at search algorithms:<p>Use cases are more similar to deterministic partial solution searches (backtracking depth first search, breadth first search) for which the more interesting problems are intractable.  Additionally, such search algorithms are very self contained, and it is usually quite difficult to combine them, making these algorithms a one time tool.<p>On the other hand, big pictures are more similar to stochastic solution spaces searches, which won't get you the best solution, but they'll get you a pretty good one much, much more quickly.  And since solution space searches all interface with the same space, they can be mixed and matched depending on what is most useful for the problem domain.  For example, with genetic algorithms, once you can make your problem domain fit a standard GA representation, the whole of GA theory can be applied.",1225853459

354119,comment,353731,353994,0,0,delackner,,,"This is it exactly.  When I first started at my current company my boss and I did not share a first language.  And only just barely a second language.  But we did share a sense of imagination, and we were astounded many times to see that in a meeting with several people present, he and I would be easily layering our ideas, while the other people in the room (all sharing his first language) needed to see very explicit drawings before hesitantly seeming to see what we were seeing.<p>Without imagination, the world is entirely composed of that which you have already seen.  How boring.",1225852999

I attended WWDC and by far the more interesting and educational experience were the labs and networking, and the videos are close to bordering on ""meh"". Useful if I want to learn something but I don't know if I'd pay up to $1000 for them, and I most likely could just live without it and asking questions on forums/mailing lists/irc.<p>I do believe there <i>are</i> some sessions available on ADC on iTunes from older WWDCs that you can watch, as well as some iPhone videos one may find handy that are all free.",1225851037

354107,comment,352800,353577,0,0,netcan,,,"That's not a product of idiots voting. It's a product of compromise.<p>The US system, favours a binary choice. You vote A or B. Australia (where I live) is even more this way. It's a stable sort of a system. Governments are fairly powerful. There is less need for the shaky post election coalitions of different systems. But it comes at a cost: Compromise.<p>Republicans (from what we hear down here) get votes from social/moral conservatives, religious conservatives, social libertarians, nationalists, militarists, & lots of other subgroups. Then you get these smelted into traditional voter groups. So an rural area in some part of the US with a certain religious, moral, social & historic heritage might be generally sympathetic towards a militarist, nationalist, socially conservative & religious party. In the US of 2008, this is the Republicans.<p>Along comes a decade where the region stands to gain from certain policies. For technical reasons, these policies are at odds with the part of a political theory at the centre of their parties history. This is the part of the political theory that supports less government intervention in their lives, a lot of freedom over their property, personal lives, & a lot of other stuff that they like. But the link between economic policy & individual liberty is very academic. They just want the damned price of canola to stay put.<p>Under a different political system (say Italy's), this issue could cause a party split. Lets say, the ICP (Idaho Conservatives Party) is formed. They put a bit more emphasis on this & a bit less on that but stay close to the former party line. The difference is they support the subsidies which benefit their voters. They join the coalition that the Republicans now need to form government because three of four of these parties split. This allows the ICP to focus mostly on subsidies & a few other issues that are important to their electorate.<p>The ICP is free to say they mostly leave issues other then sex education, subsidies & genetic patenting to the Republicans.  The Republicans are free to admit that they don't like subsidy A, but it's a small price to pay to form Government. Otherwise they would have to get a different party on board with different compromises or reform the government. Theoretically, this allows parties to stay loyal to core principals.<p>Deals get done either way. The US's system is more stable. But you could argue it's less Democratic. Minority opinions are under represented. Voters make bigger compromises & get a less granular control over what their vote means. This is probably felt more now that there are several divisive issues on the agenda.",1225850495

3343146,comment,3341641,3342103,1,0,Fluxx,,,"The dirty little secret about ""music discovery"" is that most people don't spend time discovering music.  Sure I do because I really like music a lot.  I regularly read Pitchfork and Stereogum and listen to a lot of music.  But I'm in the minority on this.  90% of society (America, for me) listen to the radio to learn about new music or occasionally get exposed to new stuff through their friend - but they're certainly not spending hours of their day playing song samples on Stereogum.<p>I think this is why Pandora is so popular.  People can pick something they know, turn the station on and just treat it like the radio.  The sad thing is that if they hear something they like on Pandora, all you can do is thumbs up it, which then can be retrieved later by finding a link buried deep in your profile...a place most Pandora users never go.",1323687393

It's a Google sponsored language that's shaping up great. <a href=""http://www.dartlang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dartlang.org/</a><p>Dart goes beyond what CoffeeScript offers. For instance, Dart can use a lot of library code and try to produce a final script that ships only the methods your program uses.<p>Dart has many parts to it. There's a Dart Editor that uses Eclipse as a foundation but actually strives to be a lightweight editor. The Dart compiler shipped with the Dart Editor is the more stable one in my experience, but it tends to produce scary JavaScript at the moment. If you tell it to produce ""optimized"" JavaScript it will try harder to make the final script smaller, but it isn't too pretty. The Editor will get some good debugging features soon.<p>Then there's a new compiler that's still being developed for Dart called Frog. It actually produces much more decent JavaScript code.<p>And there's a VM for Dart that's useful for testing and developing smaller scripts that can run without the browser. There's a promise that the VM will be integrated with a branch of the WebKit browser component which should help with making use of the VM in a browser environment. Maybe next week we'll get a first version of it. (I speak as a user.)<p>As they say, the sky is the limit.

Ubuntu does the same thing (as pointed out in the linked article) and it has been talked about happening to other packages be other packagers too.<p>It isn't something that you'll ever stop happening, but if the authors of software containing affiliate IDs to embed into links there is at least a way to make it obvious to the user. Make it a configurable option. Keep your own affiliate link hard-coded, but include a spot in the per-install and per-user configuration files where a different affiliate ID can be provided. On first run for a given user, if there is an alternate ID provided in the global configuration give the user the choice of which to use: the author's ID or the packager's ID, and store the choice in the per-user config file. You could even give the user the option to opt-out completely, which would be a nice gesture, and a knowledgeable user could change the ID at a later date by editing the config (or you could provide a box in the options area of any GUI associated with the application).<p>This way the user knows if the packager has suggested a different ID (if they haven't either just keep quiet and use the default or give the user a ""Can we use our affiliate ID please? It funds development of this tool."" yes/no option on first start), unless the packager patches around that, which would in my opinion be too far over the shady side of the line. By all means keep your affiliate ID (or the yes option if it is just a yes/no situation) as the default (again, if the package maintainer mess with this rather than just providing an alternate ID to chose from I'd consider that ""not cricket""): I can't speak for all users but if I'm asked and it is explained to me exactly what is being sent/tracked and why I will probably say yes, if an affiliate ID is ""sneaked in"" without me knowing and I find out I'm liable to go to some lengths to block it.",1323686379

Sexism exists in some place, but so does enjoyment by men or women for certain careers.

3343090,comment,3342309,3342309,12,0,mhw,,,"I don't know about fragmentation - a quick look through the examples pulled out in the linked article just makes me think ""sloppy"".<p>But I do want to pick up on this idea that touch-based interfaces should all have the same look and feel. That idea made (and to some extent still makes) sense when you have a large desktop shared by a number of different applications, and the user is constantly shifting between them as part of their workflow.<p>But I think there's been a shift over the last few years. On the desktop we have monolithic applications where the user's workflow is expected to be entirely within the application, and these applications have increasingly adopted their own specialised UI style and assumed that they will run full screen. I first saw this with 3d graphic applications like Blender, but you can also see it in things like Aperture and Lightroom with their inconsistent dark palette.<p>And I think this is more pronounced on smartphones and particularly on tablets, where the application you are running takes over the whole display. They aren't described as ""immersive"" for nothing. I'd argue that when an application is something that you completely immerse yourself in, the need for visual consistency is reduced (though not removed). Yes, we need some common visual language, and for people to understand how that relates to common gestures for interaction. But I think the stand-out applications will be the ones that have a visual style that is consistent with the content of the application, and maybe with other applications from the same publisher.<p>I'd draw a comparison with magazines, particularly as that's representative of the kind of content that is making its way into custom applications on tablets. We don't expect Vogue and Wired to share a consistent font and the same iconography to help the reader navigate - instead we expect each of them to have their own house style consistent from issue to issue, but different from other magazines from the same stable.

As you say, there are many sources of risks to employees that have a direct effect on the business.<p>2.  The division in this discussion seems to stem around how best to manage the risk of project impact caused by losing a critical team member owing to pregnancy event.<p>3.  Extreme positions:<p>a.  The risk to the business is little different from any other unplanned risk that the business needs to deal with anyway, and to <i>assume</i> otherwise is to be sexist;  i.e. there may be women out there for whom pregnancy does not impact their work any more than an illness, and assuming that all women are equally likely to fall pregnant and handle pregnancy in the same way is discriminatory.<p>b.  An ethical/strategic position whereby the additional risk is accepted because the benefits gained in terms of equity makes the risk acceptable.<p>c.  Pregnancy is a flat-out optional potential risk to the business and since a business owner wants to reduce risk then it's logical to avoid employing women.<p>4.  IMO this is all a matter of opinion and has everything  to do with one's appetite for risk, one's risk exposure (capital & risk management) and one's principles.  The same person given two different startups could come to different conclusions depending on these variables, for instance.<p>Given this, I really don't see the point of this discussion as it is pretty much subjective and depends entirely on the startup in question and the owners invested therein.",1323685502

(Including, but not exclusively, money/donation/jobs/whatever by an entity supported by ads like Google, continued inclusion in the Chrome store, etc.)? Or any negative consequences if the change wasnt implemented?<p>Wladimir Palant: I don't think that we get anything yet but we indeed hope to get some income this way to make the project sustainable. This doesn't mean that paying us is the requirement to be added to the exceptions list - the requirements a formulated here and they will probably become more precise as we gain experience (suggestions are welcome). As to Google: no, they have nothing to do with it. We didn't talk to Google, we didn't take money from them, there is no conspiracy here. We did look at Google Ads as a typical example (unblocking them is the most common request we get yet most people lack the knowledge for that) but they don't meet our requirements at the moment. Google's search ads are a different thing and they can meet our requirements depending on how the website configures them - and we did add an exception for them on one particular website.<p>2) If the goal is to allow people who would like to see ads to see them, why not have asked if people wanted to see them (ie, neutral yes/no question), rather than pushing a default setting which shows those non intrusive ads?<p>Wladimir Palant: We made some bad experience when asking people to make a decision, quite frequently people would ignore the question on the first-run page for one reason or another and then wonder why Adblock Plus ""isn't working"". In fact, that's the reason why the first-run page was reworked - rather than asking, we now subscribe people to a filter list automatically and allow them to revert the decision easily (simplifying Filter Preferences dialog was an important requirement for that). It's the same with ""acceptable ads"" - asking people to make a decision when it might be a wrong time, when they don't know what we are asking about (I tried to keep the explanation page short but it certainly isn't) etc. isn't going to work well. Instead we focused on making opt-out as simple as possible at any time.<p><a href=""https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=8872&start=30#p53166"" rel=""nofollow"">https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=8872&#...</a>",1323685110

3343015,comment,3342194,3342810,3,0,bermanoid,,,"<i>200 years ago, women (and, say, black people) weren't doctors. People argued then, as you do now, that the current situation was just the outcome of natural differences. They said that not because it was true (it wasn't) or because they had any real evidence (they didn't). They said it because it was convenient for them to believe that.</i><p>That people in the past argued that something was due to natural differences doesn't necessarily mean that natural differences don't exist, and that they had no evidence then doesn't mean that we have none now. Men and women differ genetically by about the same amount that humans and chimpanzees do, so to discount the possibility that there just might be some real differences in the way we are prone to behave is just as ridiculous as to suggest that those genes account for the entire difference.<p>There are very solid biological reasons to believe that men should always be more genetically inclined to seek out reproductive risk than women (male reproductive success is more variable than female success by a good margin). It's not a very big stretch from there to conjecture that perhaps nature achieved that by cranking up the overall risk tolerance knob in men, since that would probably require fewer bit-flips than hard coding a condition for reproductive risk - in fact, to a large extent, we know that testosterone does exactly what this would require. That would explain a lot about why men are more likely than women to go in for high-risk high-reward ventures like startups...<p>I'm not saying that social factors are not in play, too, but quite frankly, these social factors are far less oppressive than they were 50 years ago, yet we've seen relatively little progress in terms of gender ratios. This makes me suspect that there are probably some other causes in effect, and the genetic one is an obvious suspect that I don't think has been properly debunked, excepting attempts to do so by overreaching appeals to equality that are, IMO, not justified by the relevant biology.",1323684110

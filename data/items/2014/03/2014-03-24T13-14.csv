7458205,comment,7456540,7456664,2,0,rsynnott,,,"> With decent technical design and Google&#x27;s Android support library you can pretty much code as if 98% of people run KitKat and not worry about it<p>People say this. It&#x27;s not really actually true.<p>A nice little example encountered recently. Say you have a HTTP server which uses gzip or deflate when the client asks it to. Pretty standard, right? And say you want to return a HTTP 204, or other contentless success. Seems reasonable? And if you do this on Android 4.4 using the standard HTTP client, it will work. If you do it on Android 4.1 (the most commonly-deployed version of Android), it will throw a null pointer exception deep in the library code.<p>This is just one of many issues. Compatibility support libraries are all very well, but they don&#x27;t really help with the standard libraries being buggy, and those bugs will _never be fixed_ for the vast majority of users.<p>It gets even worse when you take OEM crap into account.

Often I want something ASAP, and even though I know I can haggle, I&#x27;ll pay the buy it now price rather than wait for a response. Alternatively I&#x27;ll wait for a real person to get back. Knowing that someone is considering my offer is pleasing, as is their comments back sometimes, explaining why they can&#x27;t meet the price I suggested, which can turn me into a customer at a slightly higher price if I like what they are selling.\nAutomating this too much removes the interaction, and the feeling of achievement - if ever purchaser from a market store in Egypt knew what people had paid before, it would feel very different.",1395669114

I&#x27;ve seen this attack demonstrated live on Windows Server. It just uses DMA to search the memory and skip the subroutine that checks whether the password entered was valid.<p>Just put glue in the firewire connector, you say? Well, for instance most laptops that can be docked are firewire-accessible through the docking port. The firewire interface is also reachable through a USB adapter. So you&#x27;d have to glue the USB ports shut as well. (Impractical). Even if you do all this, most motherboards have the FireWire interface enabled on a PCI level, <i>even if there are no physical PCI ports</i> on the computer. So against this attack you&#x27;d be pretty much hosed regardless, unless you use a chipset that explicitly doesn&#x27;t implement FireWire.",1395669071

Lets say they have a 30min lunch break and stuff around at the arcade/gaming area for an hour. That is still a solid 7 hours worth of work each day!<p>So 12 developers each working a solid 7 hours each day but unable to produce quality work within a reasonable time frame. That says one of a few things:<p>1) The team is working hard but you have a lot of crap code (aka technical debt) and so it takes a long time to make even simple changes.<p>2) The team has implemented more thorough processes. E.g. Previously they might have went straight from coding a fix to putting it into production but now they have proper QA and Testing phases. So now it looks to outsiders that they are &quot;complacent&quot; when they have really just improved processes.<p>I would never give a business person an estimate of anything less than a day.<p>3) Politics/dynamics between the dev team and the rest of the office have changed. For example if management had a serious go at the developers for a defect in production or business users have been passing the blame onto developers, or everyone got pay rises/bonuses but the devs, etc then it is likely they are operating in an extreme risk averse, document everything manner.<p>I know entire dev teams who have stopped being productive because business stopped listening to them.<p>4) Team politics. Are one or two of the developers/managers doing something that is really throwing the other developers out of joint?<p>5) The team <i>is</i> productive and business expects too much or is only looking at superficial indicators. For example you keep mentioning standard working hours as though working 8 hours is being lazy. The devs having fun at the arcade/gaming area. The rest of the company &quot;grinding&quot; etc. It almost looks like you care more about shared misery than results.<p>If you bring in a new developer and they are significantly more productive than the existing team then you could rule out 1&2&5.",1395668384

There are four freedoms that free software must respect: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a><p>If a license software respects <i>all</i> of those freedoms, it is a free license. Otherwise, it is non-free.<p>Note that the ability to apply additional restrictions to existing software is <i>not</i> one of the four freedoms.<p>>  It really confounds me how RMS can reject DRM but be so supportive of his own freedom-limiting psychological DRM of sorts.<p>I assume you&#x27;re referring to the GPL. Understand that the GPL is meant to be a hack of the system: it&#x27;s a software license (copyright) written by a group who fundamentally believes that copyright to software (as it is currently used) <i>should not exist</i>[0].<p>The GPL is a twist of copyright law to force it to do the exact opposite of what it was intended to do: instead of restricting others&#x27; freedoms, it preserves them.<p>[0] The FSF does not actively oppose software copyright because doing so would harm the GPL (and therefore harm free software), but the origins of the free software movement are deeply tied to the question of whether or not software <i>should</i> be copyrightable at all - not so long ago, this was not an obvious question.<p>And yes, for those who are wondering, it is certainly possible to have free software in a world in which software is not eligible for copyright protections. The GPL is meant as a hack around the <i>current</i> system, as we have it now.",1395666994

Wouldn&#x27;t a system like this be subject to virtually everyone finding the lowest price almost immediately?<p>Because I intuitively understand that there is a fixed price floor, it just feels wrong. What&#x27;s weird is that I don&#x27;t get this feeling when I&#x27;m bargaining with someone in person. Even if we&#x27;re trying to find an agreeable price, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve lost when we agree, just because he might go a little lower.<p>My guess is that this has a lot to do with instantly receiving the item in question.",1395666286

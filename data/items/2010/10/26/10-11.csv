I'd be willing to be there will be another 3-4 dozen that get funded by the end of the year.<p>The vast majority of those startups are Web/Mobile/Social/Gaming startups.  Take 100 startups with $500k in the bank looking for one two three (web/mobile/flash) developers and you have a rough idea of what the hiring market is like in SF.  Add Facebook, Linked In, Twitter, Yelp and Google starting to compete more heavily for engineers, and you'll start to see why recruitment is going to get a lot tougher in the next year or two for startups.<p>From Mountain View South to San Jose and in the East Bay, the startups have traditionally been more hardware/silicon oriented.  Those industries have been consolidating a lot, and those companies have been laying off people.

Unfortunately it's not a pro post, as I’m far from being a good blogger and english is not my 1st language.<p>That is not a secret that group buying (daily deals, social e-commerce, Groupon) is one of the most popular web topic in 2010 and the biggest trend which is growing world wide. How many of you tried to build something in that area? I guess that's scary to jump to the car overload by passengers.<p>This is my personal view of how daily deals industry started and developing:<p>1)	Woot.com (2004) – I think this website is a 1st seed in group buying<p>2)	Groupon (2008)  brought group buying in new level by offering deals from services and local merchants. Groupon is the most cloned website in history of internet, more than 1000 clones over the world (Dec 2009 – May 2010). I wanted to make one too ))<p>3)	Daily deal aggregators (yipit, dealradar and etc). I would compare aggregators to price comparison websites.<p>4)	Specific daily deals websites (food and dining, fitness and workout, products). More services coming in that area for sure.<p>5)	Traditional stores start their daily deal section on their websites (target, compusa and etc)<p>6)	Some big players start their own daily deals services. Aol (with wow.com). Who next? Ebay? Amazon?<p>7)	Free daily deals – TapZilla.com gives out a limited amount of applications for iphone for free<p>8)	Groupon starts integration with  Ning and Ebay<p>9)	Groupon  offers a tool to merchant to run deals by the own<p>10)	 …<p>I was tempted to do daily deals website, but decided to jump to deals aggregator, that was a time when the most of daily deals websites did not have the affiliate platforms. We were forced to parsing/indexing their pages without having any affiliate with them. Now the most of them have affiliate with CJ or other platforms (some of them run own platform, which is not good idea). I left aggregator idea too.<p>We all are in the middle of the road of social e-com.

1833673,comment,1833010,1833598,0,0,nadam,,,"As much as I like pg's essays generally I don't particularly like his essays on hardcore programming topics like language design. Maybe it is because I am inexperienced in most of the topics he discusses in his essays but I am quite experienced in programming.<p>Some reactions to the essay:<p>""I predict a similar fate for Java""<p>It is ridiculous that pg once said he does not know Java at all. Yet he expresses his opinions about it. How can I take his opinion seriously as someone who knows almost the whole language specification of Java by head and had been programming in Java for at least 9 years? It is not only knowing the language which is important. But knowing all those problem patterns that have to be solved at typical enterprise projects. These projects are inherently complicated and has a lot to do with databases (and less with expressing nice and elegant algorithms). Java is not a particularly good language, but without developing a lot for in enterprise projects you really don't know what is needed by those projects. That said my favourite language is Scala. It ihas all the advantages of Java and the Java platform but it is a much better language than Java. It is not a 'pure' language. Pure languages never really do well for widespread practical use.<p>""I think it's important not just that the axioms be well chosen, but that there be few of them. Mathematicians have always felt this way about axioms-- the fewer, the better-- and I think they're onto something.""<p>First the core language in mathematics (the language of first order logic) is orthogonal to axioms. You can have a language with simple syntax (some math books define such a minimalistic language for first order logic), but it will not be good for practical use and will not be concise. So for practical use and for conciseness mathematicians have introduced plently of notations. (e.g. typographical conventions for differentiation, integration, infix syntax for addition, multiplication, etc...), etc. The real-world language that mathematicians use day-to-day is more like let's say Scala than a very pure language.<p>Axioms (and theorems derived from them) are more like libraries. There are plenty of axiom systems: (separate for numbers, geomerty, etc...) The whole mathematics is something like the Java ecosystem: lots of libraries.<p>What pg speaks about is some kind of utopia. A world where all programmers have to do is to express elegant algorithms. But programmers have to solve complex problems which mostly don't have an elegant solution at all. 100 years later we will still not have incredibly elegant solutions for our then hard problems. Even mathematicians don't always have elegant minimalistic solutions for their problems. Andrew Wiles worked for 10 years to prove his theorem. The proof is the result of lots of work and knowledge, and is incredibly complex. It does not fit on the margin at all.<p>Just look at natural languages: they are incredibly useful and concise in some sense, but they are incredibly complex. Programming languages will never be so complex, but they will not necessarily be extremely simple either.<p>Edit: I love minimalism, and I hate convoluted overcomplicated libraries and code bases, and I hate very leaky abstractions. The smaller the code base is the better: this is my main philosophy. But I still think that pg goes too far with his utopia for simplicity. I think that simplicity and conciseness of application code requires some complexity and intricacy on the core language and libraries side.",1288088609

I mean, Lisp is already at least a 100 year language IMO so what could Arc do to make itself more so?  What is it going to do that the other two popular Lisp-1s don't?  The only differentiator I've seen so far is pg's confusion of terse for concise [1].<p>I think there is always more room for programming languages in the world, especially given how awful most of them are.  I just think they need some clear reason to exist or their creation isn't worth the fracturing effect [2].<p>[1] Personally I use terse to mean ""short and unreadable"" and concise to mean ""short and <i>more</i> readable"" (think: ""I didn't have time to write a short letter..."").  The first thing that occurred to me when I saw Arc was ""oh man, a bunch of cryptic one or two letter functions.  Is this meant to be programmed over a 1200 baud modem or something?""  Every one of those kinds of things is something that has to be memorized, and given how much more advanced IDEs are today what's lost in readability is not made up in typing savings.  For me the classic example of ""concisity"" is Smalltalk.  Most methods are just a line or two, they read almost literally as English yet so much is said with so little.  No meaningless cryptic two letter sequences but yet one line is equivalent to at least 3 lines of Java [3].<p>[2] I.e. users becoming party of a community of this new mostly irrelevant language A instead of helping the community of the language that would have been said to obsolete A if it had been written after A instead of before it.<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&printTitle=Smalltalk_and_Productivity&entry=3256379312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=tr...</a>",1288088451

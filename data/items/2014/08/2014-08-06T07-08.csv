8141481,comment,8140767,8140767,1,0,wallflower,,,"There is a saying in education that if something new comes in and threatens the education system - the system will co-opt and neutralize it so that it does not threaten the system.<p>For example, when computers first started being used in classrooms, they were usually used by progressive teachers in a single classroom (they could usually only afford one). The school &#x27;neutralized&#x27; it by moving them to a dedicated classroom and teaching the students secondary skills like typing, rather than using it to create with/explore with as part of the curriculum. This continues to present day - with app literacy (Powerpoint) substituted for typing (usually).<p>iPads are an interesting case. They are not necessarily coming in from the grassroots (the teachers) but from the top-down. Teachers, in some cases, are the ones fighting the iPads. In fact, most of my educator friends, view the iPad &#x27;magical device&#x27; moniker with disdain. It&#x27;s not so much the walled garden as the hype.<p>This co-opting is also happening with the Maker Movement in schools. As soon as the Maker Movement moves beyond the single classroom, questions start getting asked. Why do you need a dedicated space? What is this Maker thing? How does making things align to Common Core (no joke<i></i>).<p><i></i> One of the problems of using Khan Academy self-styled learning is that it is very hard to map Khan Academy lessons to traditional student learning objectives (as mapped out in 1.2.3.4 level detail by the school district or state). Without explicit mappings, it&#x27;s a hard(er) sell.",1407311685

8141454,comment,8139508,8141340,15,0,beloch,,,"Studies of the ǃKung San, who were recently hunter-gatherers living in a rather marginal environment, showed that they could get by doing <i>far</i> less work than farmers.  The work they did do was strenuous.  For example, they practiced persistence hunting.  However, on average they had a lot more leisure time.  Being a hunter-gatherer was probably an even sweeter deal before farmers and ranchers gobbled up all the prime real estate.<p>Interestingly enough, the recent history of the !Kung shows that settling down and joining the rest of civilization does not always benefit the fairer sex.  !Kung society was much less sexist before contact than it is now, as the surrounding peoples they are now in contact with are not exactly the most egalitarian.  Most archaeologists consider egalitarian social structure to be typical of hunter-gatherer societies, with rigid hierarchical structure being an innovation resulting from settlement.  Consider the concept of being &quot;rich&quot; for example.  In a nomadic pastoral culture, wealth might be owning a big herd.  In a sedentary culture, wealth might take the form of housing or accumulated items.  A hunter-gatherer does not own animals and has to carry everything he/she owns around.  A hunter-gather&#x27;s abilities are his/her wealth.<p>There are plenty of &quot;civilized&quot; places on Earth today where being poor is basically hell.  There&#x27;s ceaseless toil, no power or freedom, pollution, violence, poor nutrition, and no real access to the wonders of modern medicine that most of us are aghast at the thought of doing without. I&#x27;d far rather be among today&#x27;s last few hunter-gatherer tribes than an immigrant worker in UAE or Qatar.",1407310565

8141448,comment,8139669,8140793,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"Nice rhetoric.<p>Unfortunately, the future value of a 70 year income stream is effectively nil.<p>You can look at this in terms of the present values of annuities or perpetuities.  In the case of a perpetuity (a constant income stream forever), the present value is expressed as:  C/r<p>Where C is the period cash flow, and r is the nominal rate of interest expressed as a decimal fraction, e.g., a 5% interest rate is given as 0.05.<p>The value for any <i>period</i> of the perpetuity is C/(1+r)^n<p>Where n is the period.<p>Assuming a $1000 constant payment stream, the <i>present</i> value of the 70th payment is only $32.86.  Double that and you&#x27;re down to $1.08 as present value of a $1000 future payment.<p>At 14 years, you&#x27;re seeing $505 in present value, at 28 years, $255.<p>This is sensitive to the interest (discount) rate, where the present value <i>falls</i> as interest <i>rises</i>.  A 10% nominal interest rate gives you a $263 value for 14 years, $69 at 28, $1.27 at 70, and $0.001 at 140 years.  At a 2% interest rate, the values are $758, $574, $250, and $62, respectively.<p>So while your argument <i>does</i> make a case for a <i>fixed term</i> of copyright, it doesn&#x27;t pass muster for an <i>extensive</i> duration.  Nor, more compellingly, does it allow for the retroactive extension of copyright duration as has been the case for the Doyle estate.  Sir Arthur didn&#x27;t write his works, published between 1887 and 1927, with any reasonable expectation that his heirs or corporate designates would be continuing to profit by them in 2014.<p><a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perpetuity.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perpetuity.asp</a>",1407310367

If you search in one of the big sites the first several pages are occupied by those properties which are going to bring the most revenue to the aggregator and which in many cases are in turn inventory provided by another site with little or no knowledge of the individual properties.  \nYou will probably never get tot he well managed properties with many 5 star reviews owned by individuals who care about your holiday experience because they are not worth as much to the aggregator so they are right at the bottom of the lists.  If the aggregator cared about your holiday they would  be at the top and possibly over the long term this would bring him more revenue because travellers would come to know that they could find the best properties quickly.\nYou also cannot get to actually speak to an owner of any of the properties on the several first pages because they are all on commission rather than subscription and obviously they don&#x27;t want you bypassing their system and paying the owner.\nLong term this is very bad for the industry and in particular for  guests.",1407310326

I&#x27;m not sure to what extent IFE was part of 787 plans.<p>I mostly worked on the Electronic Flight Bag, which is a hilarious case of Boeing realizing that paper flight bags were asinine, and then coming up with an industrial strength solution to the problem of carrying what amounted to a few PDFs on board an airplane.<p>Last time I checked (years ago) airlines were just moving to iPads whenever possible.<p>(A flight bag has hundreds upon hundreds of pages of paper that are required by law to be on board an airplane with the pilot, everything from safety literature to information on the current flight, it is a huge hassle)<p>Again the problem here is, if Boeing ships something stock, the FAA equivalent in every market a plane will be sold into has to agree to every decision made. If a single regulatory body anywhere declares that iPads are not safe for use onboard an airplane, well, the entire idea gets scrapped. This happens to a lot of good ideas.<p>If Boeing had its way, we&#x27;d all have in flight cellular, Wi-Fi, and more, as options on every plane trip we took. Boeing spends a lot of time and a lot of effort on what they know will likely be futile efforts to improve the passengers&#x27; experience. But they try anyway.

The whole point is there&#x27;s no &quot;14:00 my time&quot;. You just work from 23:00UTC to 08:00UTC and take your lunch at 02:00UTC. All your clocks are UTC.<p>> No longer does &quot;6pm&quot; mean &quot;close to sunset&quot; for most people. You have to keep a sunset/sunrise calculator with you at all times just so you can remember what time to set that alarm in order to be at the local office on time. Then when you travel between places that will used to have timezones you&#x27;ll need to adjust your sunset/sunrise calculator. No longer can you simply set the alarm to go off at 6am local time.<p>True, it makes life harder for people who are physically travelling to a different office every week. But how many is that, compared to the number of people who need to arrange a phone/video call with someone in a different office? And that ratio is only going to push further.<p>> You&#x27;re replacing a superficial problem with an actual one: everyone who doesn&#x27;t live in the reference time locality will be living on bizarre time.<p>What&#x27;s the problem?

Of all the hundreds or millions of patents it's only possible to find very few if any historical examples where patents stifle innovation.<p>What patents do achieve is exactly what they are there for. which is to protect the inventor of something usefull for a period of time.<p>If you want to use innovation that has patent protection, you should reward the person who invented it, OR invent something better youreself.<p>That applices to things like Ogg Thorbis, where new technologies were developed in spite of patents. If there were not patents on MPEG Ogg would not have been innovated.<p>Same with file systems, if there were no patentson NTFS or FAT, then why would ext3 and so on mabey would not be where they are now.<p>Fact is patents are there for a reason, (apart from it being law). They appear to work, and they dont appear to be affecting innovation to any degree.<p>Sure, there are groups who would be happy to ride the coat tails of others innovations and inventions. But that is only so they are not able to innovate themselves.

It's been 2 years and this is still their policy, so they must really be struggling over whether they want people to be able to give them money from mobile devices.  Even something like this, with using Amazon data, fosters a much more active and healthy market that Amazon benefits from.  That kind of thing is intangible, though, and businesspeople can be stupendous boneheads when it comes to such things.  They assume the market is always open and active, with people integrating media products into their lives, regardless of what happens.  They're wrong, and Amazons business will hurt if they make it more difficult for people to read about products Amazon carries (even if Amazon is not mentioned at any point).  If some other source steps up, the market will still be helped, but Amazon will be left out in the cold as far as the information they currently gather from usage of their API, so it will end up hurting them one way or another.",1264952931

1090557,comment,1088713,1088817,0,0,Mz,,,"A few years ago, I took a class called ""Homelessness an Public Policy"" through a San Francisco college.  My recollection:  There are roughly as many homeless people in SF as there are in New York, even though the overall population of New York is way higher (8 to 10 times higher?).  Most likely, part of the reason is the weather.  The San Francisco Bay Area is the only part of the US with a Mediterranean climate, which means it is relatively temperate year round.  It doesn't get that cold in the winter, it doesn't get that hot in the summer.  Iirc, the average daytime temperature in Napa is 60 - 80 degrees Fahrenheit year round.  I was in Solano County at the time and we had much hotter weather in the summer.  I went to San Francisco for a medical test in June.  It was in the nineties in Fairfield.  It was 30 degrees cooler in San Francisco. I made sure to take a jacket. I still was uncomfortably cold.  Extremes of heat and cold both kill homeless people.  So the weather/climate probably has a lot more to do with the high levels of homelessness in San Francisco than the political climate.",1264951968

Well I don't ... all I know is how to drive it, and I've had problems because of that ... but it's not like I care.

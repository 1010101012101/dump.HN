I wonder how big a part of it is language... how long was it before horseless carriages became cars?",1220064490

That loses a great deal of hacker right there.<p>2. The site (I copy-pasted the link) keeps talking about anything except about what it actually does. I don't know what streetread is. I'm confused and about to drop out.<p>3. So I clicked through to the home page and now I know what it does. You really need to explain how this is any better/different than google finance. There is no FAQ linked from home page. At this point I lose interest and drop out.<p>FWIW.",1220064349

Being able to do 100 proper pushups consecutively is no easy task and requires a lot of work from supporting muscle groups (back, abs, deltoids, quads and hamstrings to a lesser extent). Your core has to be strong in order to maintain the rigidity necessary to control the motion. Granted, if you plan on playing soccer, you'd still want to work your legs directly, but don't think that the rest of your body didn't benefit from doing all those pushups / benchpresses. However, those other muscles won't necessarily get as ""bulky"", as tension-type exercises don't generate that kind of result (think pilates).",1220061631

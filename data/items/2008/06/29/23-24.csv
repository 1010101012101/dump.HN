They urge 'believers' to gruesomely kill anyone who disagrees with their particular set of outlandish beliefs (even if the non-believer doesn't do anything to harm you).<p>So yes, a priori I do discount Jews and Muslims. Frankly, if you choose to associate yourself with the sort of racist, misogynistic, intolerant tripe that permeates the torah and quran, I place you on about the same level as neo-nazis and book burners. You should be allowed to spew whatever bullshit you want, but you're a moron and will be treated accordingly.<p>Just so we're clear, I'm all in favor of religion (or atheism, or agnosticism) in principle. I'm just <i>strongly</i> against any world view and philosophy that demands you <i>kill</i> people who disagree with you, but aren't trying to harm you.",1214783971

What one knows shows what they're interested in, but can they learn new things fast?<p>I do agree that a title of junior-developer for people who've been in the industry for a while seems silly.",1214782946

231555,comment,231168,231270,0,0,aneesh,,,"No, ratings don't change without votes being cast.  But new posts automatically start out with a higher rating, so a post must grow its (positive) vote differential by 10x to ""keep up"" with the new posts. The rating increases as a log of the vote differential, so the <i>votes</i> need to increase exponentially, not the rating.  The vote differential increasing by 100x would result in an increase of 2 rating points (this is what a logarithm means).<p>A new post submitted on June 8, 2008 would have started out with about 1753 rating points, and this number grows by a little less than 2 every day.  So it's not that big to store.",1214782517
231554,comment,231168,231396,0,0,aneesh,,,"Yeah, you're right.  I simplified it since posts falling down is easier to conceptually understand.  New posts start out with a higher rating, and an old posts needs to boost its rating 10x to be at the level a posts starts out at 12.5 hours later.<p>The effect is the same though.",1214782225

Not that this is a realistic threat, it just underlines a certain incompatibility with modern sensibilities.<p>What I would like to hear is Muslim ""moderates"" clarifying is this so or not. Its one thing for them to say its hysteria, another thing if they say that and yet believe in supremacy.",1214782177

231550,comment,231539,231539,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"Well I guess it depends on what you're doing. I have experience with both Drupal and Joomla to name a couple. I like Drupal, I don't like Joomla. Just my subjective experience.<p>If what you're doing is really left of field, then yeah, probably you are better off just making something yourself with Rails or whatever.<p>But to answer your original musing, I think it would be worth putting in some time to trial out the ready made options that are out there, you could save your self a lot of time. If you don't like them, you can always start your own thing. It doesn't take long to install either Drupal or Joomla (though I would choose Drupal if I were you).<p>Drupal has a well developed taxonomy system (essentially a way of tagging content with terms) that can be used in a variety of ways (from setting up a very granular access control system to just logically organising content) and is very flexible. It's got a good templating system. It has great community support and good documentation. As you allude, it has a huge amount of plug-in modules (all free, unlike Joomla, where more of a business has grown around selling plug-in modules for cash).<p>But as you are obviously aware, if you use software developed by someone else, you're of course starting from their point of view. I think this applies even with frameworks like Rails... Rails is DHH's point of view. Drupal is the Drupal developers point of view. If you're going to find it useful to stand on the shoulders of giant's, then you have to agree with the giant. :)<p>I've trialled many CMSes, and from the ready made options out there, Drupal is the best option I have so far found.",1214781714

The systems we're building today should be able to support us well into the future.<p>The problem is that technology has advanced so quickly that what was adequate a few years ago (up to 20, even), is not going to work. We couldn't really predict that we would have taken to this whole technology thing so openly.<p>...after all, ""640K ought to be enough for anybody.""",1214781419

Where a company falls on this line depends on their organization's size, purpose, and business model.",1214781355
231546,comment,231153,231328,0,0,wheels,,,"Well, but it also doesn't have very much to do with Islam, which is why all of these sorts of things do pander a bit to a prejudiced bent.  The social patterns of say, Turkish in Germany (where I live now) and Mexican-Americans in the southern US (where I grew up) are roughly comparable and all of the specifically ""Muslim"" traits can be more effectively explained in socio-economic terms.<p>Islam, like all of the major world religions, has shown remarkable flexibility in adapting to the societies where it has spread.  One way you can pretty easily see this is that despite the four countries with the largest Muslim populations not being in the Middle East or northern Africa, ""muslim"" culture, in this context, is almost always referring to those regions.",1214781114

The only difference between this result and any other result is that Southwest told Google what to put as their picture and sub-links, and Google made them pay for it.

In the free market economy however, the price is dictated by the market itself. Add on top of it some government regulations that would put a burden upon gas use and you&#x27;ll may get well beyond the current market price for gas. The reasoning about electricity price (that followed after the piece I quoted) has the same kind of fallacy in it, assuming too much. It would be economically viable to just capture the cheap daytime energy peaks in some sort of stable and effective energy carrier for later use, and if you could easily transport and sell it - even better! I am not saying that the it should be hydrogen, mind you. Other than that, I mostly agree with the ideas debated.<p>Edit: As I read further, I see author&#x27;s solution - ethanol and methanol. On price, only methanol is considered (the ethanol is obviously more expensive), and here I am not sure (considering the prospect of fuel handling by civilians) if the author is aware that methanol is highly poisonous.",1382626462

I actually dove in and purchased it since I&#x27;ve wanted for so long an email client built around people.<p>I have a few criticism after actually using it (admittedly for only a few minutes here):<p>* The lack of an &quot;Inbox&quot; is disconcerting. It actually really is important to me to just see a list of emails in my inbox, most recent on top, with unread messages marked as such.<p>* People centric is great, but conversation centric is equally important. Apple Mail and Gmail get high marks on organizing emails by conversation thread, but both I found lacking in their organization by person. This app has the opposite problem: It&#x27;s great for viewing emails by person, but that&#x27;s like the ONLY feature. I really strongly dislike how it munges together different conversation threads under a person, which at the same time <i>excludes</i> other emails from other people that were part of that thread.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ll add these features later but for now I&#x27;ll probably slink back to Apple Mail and maybe keep an eye on it.<p>YMMV",1382626153

Sure, if you only send emails that are a couple of sentences this might make sense. But that&#x27;s not what people use email for. That&#x27;s what they use one of the bazillion IM services for. And the IM GUI vocabulary breaks down very quickly for real world email use.<p>The abstract root of the problem with &quot;let&#x27;s reinvent email clients&quot; to me is this: There are things that I want to do in email and things I do not want to do in email. The &quot;attachments reinvented&quot; (really?) is such an example: Sure, you could show all the attachments for one person in one place. But when would I use that? In most cases what I want to do is move data out of email and get them where they are useful. Gluing them closer to the emails solves no problem for me.<p>I get that this is all social and everything, so as somebody who mostly uses email for work, I&#x27;m not the target audience. But either you mostly work stuff with emails (then this fails on a number of fronts), or you do mostly social... no wait, you don&#x27;t do mostly social with emails. That&#x27;s the problem. And that&#x27;s why most email clients are not very satisfying for one particular use - because serving multiple uses at the same time simply is a dirty business.<p>Sorry to fall into the typical HN snark here, but that&#x27;s how I feel: It does look nice, but so could a thunderbird theme.<p>Footnotes:<p>- &quot;Sent with Unibox&quot;, really?<p>- No overview window (at least none shown - do I have to click through the people sidebar to find a recent email if I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m searching for?)<p>- mentioning &quot;Exchange&quot; - be very careful here, saying that you support Exchange sets a very specific set of expectations that I&#x27;m pretty sure you cannot meet.

Secondarily, Android didn&#x27;t used to have concurrent GC. Thirdly the animations were not tuned (q.v. Butter). Fourthly, the graphics stack was tuned to use more GPU-based operations as mobile GPUs improved. If you know you have only OS overhead when you are the foreground task, lots of things get more deterministic. But that does not mean you have more total throughput.<p>For that matter, Android didn&#x27;t have low-latency audio until 4.2.<p>Try taking a look at how many processes, and Dalvik instances, are running concurrently at boot time on an Android device. Then try just starting that many VM instances, of any VM, on any other OS. The reason Microsoft has gone to pre-compiling &quot;in the cloud&quot; is that otherwise the CLR has a miserable startup time and mediocre performance. The CLR architecture is much more like a conventional Java VM. You can&#x27;t build a whole OS on a managed language implementation of OS features with that level of performance.<p>I&#x27;d wager Microsoft has a much rougher road ahead stuffing a real Windows kernel into handsets and maturing CLR performance, memory efficiency, and battery life for comparable computing tasks that Android handles well in all performance dimensions.",1382624083

This would allow power-assist type &quot;bicycles&quot;, but would not allow for a no-pedaling, hand-operated throttle type. (Those could be classified as &quot;electric vehicles&quot; or something else.)<p>(Also, maybe the maximum wattage of power assistance should be capped to keep it within the range possible from healthy humans.)",1382623561

Assume none of them work full time, in-fact lets say they work 1/3 of a full time job so about 700 hours a year. That&#x27;s just over 1 Billion labor hours a year. Now they make about 5 Billion in profit so just how much more pay can they squeeze out of that? Every dollar increase in base pay would shrink profits by 20%.",1382623518

Note that this applies to strict cover-versions only and only for songs registered with the GEMA - no major edits permitted.<p>If that still holds true if the cover is used in a documentary is a separate question.

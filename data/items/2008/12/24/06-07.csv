I don't know if AFF can be categorized as startup, but startups that do not have enough cash flow (the real cash) for 2 or 3 year of expenses and etc should not go for public unless you want to get burned by short-sellers and opportunist. I work part-time in Japanese startup in my leisure time. We are only 10~ people (not all of us are developer) but already generating $4M of net income last year(not try to brag on it, since I'm sure we're not the best) and by the way we did end-year party last night I am pretty sure it's more than doubled. We choose not to raise fund or sell IPO because we feel steadier without it. Unless you have great growth that can ensure market (remember, todays market is mostly based on fear) or you have great trouble and IPO is the only thing that can save you, don't enter the market :)",1230101989

Prototyping anything doesn't mean using the new whiz bang language, it means using whatever you know.  html+javascript, flash, sed<i>, java, lisp, C++, it doesn't matter.  It is about finding out if the idea works or not.<p></i>For a fun side story I wrote the original search engine for toybin.org in sed :)",1230100377

It's true that Chile is more capitalist; that could be an advantage or disadvantage depending on your point of view.  My wife and I just got our work visas last week after working on it for a year and a half.  (It's much easier if you aren't trying to set up a new Argentine company, without Argentine employees or partners, at the same time.)",1230099451

Some Americans I know haven't ever tasted a tomato in their life.  We even pushed EU using our WTO muscle to force-feed them genetically modified bananas (even though they really preferred the real thing) to support our suffering enterprises. I recommend ""The Blessed Unrest"" as an introductory reading on what happens when you let enterprises to get too creative.<p>Do you know that it is FCC that keeps you from being eaten alive by your friendly cable company? It's FCC who has been forcing them to open up and free us from those retarded cable boxes. It is FCC who is fighting the war against cable morons to eventually allow us simply hook up our computers and watch Hi-def unencrypted TV.<p>Telecom industry is prone to ""natural monopolies"".

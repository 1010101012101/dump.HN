84127,comment,84068,84123,0,0,rms,,,"OK, I understand that there are many people that like gambling for gambling's sake. I played online poker during its peak and I enjoy draftmix now. I do some sports betting from time to time. There are certainly many people out there who stopped playing poker online after Bush messed it up and are looking for a gambling fix.<p>I think all of those people are going to keep looking and not even blink an eye at this. When you're betting on which currency goes up or down during a one hour period, there is not even the feeling that skill is involved, online sports betting and poker and fantasy sports.<p>I just don't think there is a market of people that would prefer to gamble on racing currencies instead of sports. Who is this market? People that have always wanted to day trade but have never tried?",1196223761

I think for most hedge funds the amount of leverage varies wildly based on what's being traded, so it's tough to apply a single rule of thumb to an entire market.",1196223500
84124,comment,84068,84101,0,0,gap,,,"You can get 400:1 leverage at most ""retail"" forex brokers. You will have fewer options if you want _lower_ leverage, not higher. Something like 90% or more of traders lose all of their money, and the market maker gets to keep all of it, so they have all the interest in offering insanely high leverage. You are practically guaranteed to wipe out your account at 400:1.",1196223016

Regardless of what the CEO says, eToro is just a run-around on anti-gaming laws; as such it's not really supposed to be a legitimate tool for forex trading.<p>Far from stupid, I'd say this is actually quite clever. What's more, it's no less moral than betting on fantasy football.",1196222687

Why not use tables if you are using .title, .body and .footer for DIVs when tables have this as default?\nI see a lot of people using DIVs on places they shouldn't. They use things like <div class=""title"" ... Why not use H1 - H6 instead?<p>HTML tags provide structure. Structure means less complexity. Using only DIVs will get you into CSS trouble.<p>Edit: A good tip: your website will look more consistent and clean when you try to build your pages by only declaring HTML tags in your CSS at first. Only when there is no other solution declare classes and IDs. And even then remember you can use multiple classes in your class attribute. Things like: class=""width50perc floatLeft textAlignRight textColor1"" are very handy.",1296121241

2147264,comment,2110756,2143180,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"A simple resolution for the question of this thread is easy:<p>For now, girls tend to pursue what <i>girls do</i> and know that computer science (CS) is <i>for boys</i> and not part of what girls do.  So, girls try to avoid CS in college.  When they try CS in college, mostly they don't like it.<p>Why don't they like it?  Girls are (1) much more emotional than boys, (2) much more <i>social</i>, (3) eager to get praise, acceptance, and approval from others from work that ""helps people"" in the sense I explained (essentially volunteer work to help suffering people), e.g., one of the daughters of Bush 43 went to Ethiopia, and (4) better at, and more strongly seek, human to human contact.<p>So, on these criteria, girls see that CS is so detailed and technical it seems (1) <i>emotionally cold</i>, (2) not very <i>social</i>, (3) not good for work that ""helps people"", and (4) not good for human to human contact.  So, many girls who try CS soon conclude that they don't like it.<p>For the future, girls who do not want to concentrate on being mommies, unlike for nearly all of history, will be able to so not concentrate and, thus, on average will be removing their genes from the gene pool.  What will be left will be genes of women especially determined to be good as mommies and even less interested in CS.<p>You missed it with my:<p>""He's all fired up about the technical topic.  Sorry, but boys have strong desires to master any technical topics around them that appear important.  In part there is a lot of innate curiosity.""<p>Then for my<p>""I'll let you justify that yourself""<p>you didn't!<p>The ""technical topics"" here are not yet nearly all that would be popular on Hacker News.  Instead the topics are whatever are ""around them"" (the boys as they grow up).  So, depending on what they see in their family, adults' careers, neighborhood, community, etc., the topics might be about cars, cattle raising, household electricity, operation of a commercial pizza oven, cardiology, roasting pastrami, trading foreign currencies, computing, etc.<p>Why?  The usual explanation is that the boys know that they are small versions of men, that men take competency in their careers very seriously, that they, the boys, do not have such competency, feel vulnerable and out of control from the lack of competency, and, thus, as part of <i>growing up</i> into such competency are eager to soak up everything that is relevant they can.  That's the standard explanation.  Although you didn't 'get it' the first time I explained it, didn't work it out for yourself, I believe you can understand this point.<p>For whatever reasons, you are straining to disagree with what I wrote.<p>I remember a girl in the fifth grade:  Her handwriting was good, and mine, as is common for boys at that age, was poor.  So, she looked at my paper and said that she couldn't read it.  So, I copied the paper again in block letters, and again she said she couldn't read it.  I copied it again in larger, extremely clear block letters, and she gave the same answer.  Of course, she was lying and having fun manipulating.  You are doing much the same.

2147263,comment,2146723,2146723,0,0,kevingadd,,,"A couple odd things about this benchmark:\nIE9 runs different tests than the rest of the browsers. I'm not sure why, and there's no mention of this anywhere in the documentation. You can confirm this by running the benchmark - IE9 completes it much quicker than the other browsers, and if you click to see the results, you'll see it only ran 4 tests (while the other browsers run way more tests). There's a chance this artificially skews IE9's test scores up.<p>It's hard to reproduce the other scores from the benchmark (IE9 is certainly fast, though)... Chrome 8, 9 and 10 all put out a miserable 350 sprites by default on my machine, so I suspect he had to change some settings to get it to perform well. If only he had provided those settings along with his results, I could reproduce them.<p>Likewise, I cannot reproduce his Firefox results either - Firefox 4 manages around 1800 sprites on my machine. This is probably because he ran it under a VM - VMWare does a pretty good job of pretending to be a 3D accelerator, but it's not a real video card. I wouldn't be shocked if this negatively affected the performance of other browsers on the benchmark as well.<p>The difficulty of reproducing his results, along with how utterly bizarre the benchmark is - I need to compile node.js to run a canvas benchmark??? - makes me wonder whether it's of any value for actually measuring real-world performance.<p>Ultimately, though, an even more important factor is that this benchmark does nothing to measure the consistency of framerates - modern browsers can suffer from some pretty severe garbage collection pauses while running games and applications written in javascript. Even if your game is running at 60fps, if it pauses for 50ms every 5 seconds to collect garbage, it's going to be a pretty terrible experience. At present, both Firefox and Chrome suffer badly from garbage collection pauses in many browser-based applications, but this is not represented in most modern benchmarks.",1296121169

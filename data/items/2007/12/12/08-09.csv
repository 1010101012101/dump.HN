Bluffing should never be random, but should be a calculated move in which you believe that the opponent has missed whatever cards they were hoping for and has a good chance of believing that you have the best hand. To bluff randomly is to throw away money.",1197449601

I have no idea how the energy to matter conversion could be done in such a way as to not destroy the organism, but it has to be possible somehow. Nature always finds a way.",1197447485

Finding life on Mars could also lend support to the panspermia hypothesis.",1197447234

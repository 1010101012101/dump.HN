I just finished reading &quot;Flash Boys&quot; by Michael Lewis and; as I understand it, this is how HFT works:<p>1. You the buyer, tell N exchanges that want to buy at a maximum price $X.<p>2. HFT &quot;watches&quot; the exchange that my bid reaches first (by milliseconds)<p>3. HFT traders then place themselves between you and the N-1 exchanges and offer to sell you the stock at the maximum bid price. They do this by finding the stock on those other exchanges at less than your max bid price and owning it for a fraction of a second before they sell it to you at a higher price.",1411484394

We do keep much of the internal systemd architecture in tact, but we do eventually aim on partially decoupling it, or at the very least expanding the breadth of configure prefixes for tuning its behavior. We are a pretty early stage project, after all.<p>Indeed, the systembsd and systemd-shim projects are working on the D-Bus interface reimplementation part.<p>Our goal right now is to be a minimal systemd base that can be plugged in interchangeably and have the vast majority of unit options be respected.<p>There already are systems that offer primitives to reuse systemd units. nosh is one of them, and there also exist scripts that can convert systemd services to SysV initscripts, and even the opposite (dshimv).",1411484317

8355626,comment,8354278,8355525,6,0,kasey_junk,,,"&quot;I can totally understand the general idea of stock trading and how it helps both those who have good ideas and need money and those who have the money and invest it according to their taste.&quot;<p>This is a cognitive bias that is very prevalent (for obvious reasons) on HN.  The markets are not primarily vehicles for moving money from investors to enterprises.  Another important, and probably dominant, purpose of the markets is to accurately price and allow the buying and selling of risk.  This is neither a new or unexpected phenomenon.<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s very hard for me to believe that something like HFT where firms go to unbelievable lengths to implement purely technological trading advantages benefit the real economy.&quot;<p>This is because of your cognitive bias and your ignorance (I mean this in the non-perjorative sense that you haven&#x27;t investigated this).  HFT firms, like any other trading participant, smooth demand curves generated either in time (buying from a participant now and selling later), venue (buying in one place and selling in another), or other ways.  This allows other participants, who are not interested in being traders to hedge their risk more efficiently and thus more cheaply.<p>&quot;The fact that financial industry as a whole just recently in the 2008/2009 crash and it&#x27;s aftermath were able to extract obscene amounts of money from our governments (i.e. us) to keep the world&#x27;s finance system from collapsing makes the suspection that most financial products purely based on a material advantage (be it monetary or technological) are akin to a scam very reasonable.&quot;<p>And now we see why gut feelings are dangerous in this discussion.  You rightly feel deeply troubled by the big bailouts that cost all of us to the advantage of a very powerful few, and you correlate that with HFT.  When in fact, HFT did not receive any bailouts and for the most part small independent shops without the size or power to engineer them.  The 2008/2009 crash was based on non-HFT traded instruments where single deals could dwarf the entirety of the HFT industry.",1411484157

One of the ways you can improve it is by converting it into a monetization channel for app developers.<p>So say a free game app has a 100K users playing the game and you know the location ( enable GPS in your SDK) of these users and the times when they are active (start tracking that too) etc then those users could answer a quick survey for larger brands (who pay per survey completed). So the survey is not about the game users are playing, but about a new movie that is launched or a new Xbox Game title that is launched etc. The free app could continue to be freely used if the user answers 1 survey every 20 times he or she plays the game.

We open source a ton of other things such as our CLI, our logging aggregation infrastructure, our continuous Postgres backup service (backs up postgres to S3). We also invest heavily in Open source, we support PostgreSQL development, and we hired the 3 most prominent Ruby Core developers so they can work on the language full time.<p>Under the hood, we use LXC a standard linux container. We generally don&#x27;t talk about this level much because it&#x27;s orthogonal to the running of your application. Most people don&#x27;t know what system libraries come pre-installed on our servers, or the versions of the operating systems, or what virtualization/containment systems we use. They know their app runs, and stays running.<p>I&#x27;m happy you&#x27;re comparing and contrasting. I think docker is a great technology like LXC and it&#x27;s very useful. I wanted to chime in on the &quot;proprietary&quot; comment because if you feel our service ever &quot;locks you in&quot; in some way, it&#x27;s likely a bug that needs to be fixed.

They concentrate on variation within words having the same meaning, rather than on differences in form between words with different meanings. They claim that no minimal pairs can be found; but how could there be no closeness in form between any words, when you have a rich vocabulary with words like &quot;lemon&quot; and &quot;scorpion&quot; as they mention? Some word pairs must be closer than others, and so how are they distinguished? Maybe the problem is that they only studied 150 words?<p>They note that &quot;the three sign languages whose phonologies have been most extensively studied (ASL, ISL, and SLN—Sign Language of the Netherlands) all have minimal pairs distinguished by features belonging to these categories [hand configuration, location, and movement],&quot; and these generalizations seem to shape much of their analysis. I know they have to start from somewhere, but is this the right way for non-native users to study a new language with a potentially unusual phonology? A sample of three well-studied languages, two of which are presumably very familiar to or native languages of the investigators, seems insufficient for generalizing about potential variation. What does the phonology of other &quot;young&quot; sign languages look like? Were any native ABSL users enlisted in searching for contrasting features and minimal pairs?<p>I&#x27;m still very curious about their question of how phonological structure arises in new languages. I don&#x27;t doubt that ABSL&#x27;s phonological structure may be increasing in complexity and regularity, but I&#x27;m not convinced that it has no phonology at all.",1411481806

But what I have noticed is what I perceive to be an increase in articles that discuss &#x27;libertarianism&#x27; stemming from the startup scene, often with some alarm. This gets mentioned in conjunction with things ranging from Uber turning its nose up at taxi regulation, to Google&#x27;s efforts to provide private bus service to its employees, to the effects of gentrification in San Francisco.<p>That said, again, I don&#x27;t live there. I&#x27;m in the Ottawa, Canada area, which is a relatively sleepy town of bureaucrats that also happens to have a fairly healthy tech scene. You wouldn&#x27;t call this area &#x27;libertarian&#x27; by any remote stretch.",1411481455

Since you said you don&#x27;t believe in fate, I guess it does. Because if you think the theory of chaos true, that is, that everything is indeed deterministic in the sense that the world state now comes directly from the world state before, and we only think it is chaos because we can&#x27;t control for all the absurd amount of variables, and if god knows everything, he sees the exact order in the chaos, and thus he knows that something as seemingly innocuous as a random number generator can have profound consequences sometimes--especially when it&#x27;s used in softwares that altogether affect millions or billions of people every day.<p>That is, pseudonumber generation in software does indeed affect a lot of people, and then if god isn&#x27;t willing it, he has by the theory of chaos absolutely no control or grasp upon the world whatsoever in the end.

That would make me uncomfortable actually, but I guess that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t believe in a supreme being having a will of its own, as opposed to us simply being governed by supreme principles or laws--I guess chaos is my god.",1411481412

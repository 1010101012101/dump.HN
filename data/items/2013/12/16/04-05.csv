Though, this is DC we&#x27;re talking about, so local PD probably has attachés from all sorts of 3 letter agencies and access to gear for limited times (with oversight, most likely). Protests that are organized, so far, seem to give ample notice (as far as broadcasting to people) as to when they will occur so coordination probably isn&#x27;t that hard (and because events take place all the time in DC that probably require such efforts that aren&#x27;t protests).<p>Though thinking about this makes me wonder: what types of things we&#x27;ll see evolve to counteract this type of surveillance, and I&#x27;ll extend, that are available now to some degree? I keep thinking back to ideas of generating noise, and I wonder what that could potentially look like, what the catalyst for demand for that type of hardware/software would be, and the incentives for the makers of it.",1387169953

6912991,comment,6911785,6911785,2,0,001sky,,,"This section on the &quot;costs&quot; of mining bitcoin is well raised and relevant>Here is the passage:<p><i><One thing I haven’t seen emphasized, however, is the extent to which the whole concept of having to “mine” Bitcoins by expending real resources amounts to a drastic retrogression — a retrogression that Adam Smith would have scorned.></i><p>This he calls out as completely misplaced:<p><i>How much does the existing banking/payment infrastructure cost? One reasonable measure are the fees charged. Standard online payment fees are 2.5%, not including the added costs fraud (chargebacks plus transactions blocked out of fear of fraud).</i><p>And he&#x27;s right. but The real cost of running a market is not, however a bid-ask spread. And he gets at the point, but its not clear, here:<p><i>Bitcoin payment fees are close to zero and fraud is impossible since Bitcoin is a bearer instrument.</i><p>The [true costs] of running a market are thos that instill [trust] in the market system. That is, what is commonly called &quot;transaction costs&quot; in economics. But these are not literal costs, which tend to be rent-extraction wherein the transaction is merely instrumental to effect a scaling biz model.[1] The true transaction cost of &quot;effective honesty&quot; are to be found in &quot;governance costs&quot;, that is...the cost of lawyers. And thus more generally, and indirectly, the primary purpose of government (eg schooling, police, courts, national defense). So, it is worth putting in context the &quot;cost&quot; of mining bitcoins here. The &quot;innovation&quot; that is provided is provided also at this seperate level of abstraction, far away from the &quot;overhead&quot; style transaction costs in a literal definition. And to the authors point, these are both measurable and <i>large</i>; such an innovation thus actualy saves wated resources that would otherwise be deployed (think of all the energy spent on anti-spam and anti fraud by CCs...that 2.X is ~mostly profits tho).<p>In any event, interesting topic and interesting post. And I think he intuits the right answer, but the exact words put forth sort of murky the point abit, IMHO.<p>[1] eg 7% of an IPO to a Bank, X% to your real estate broker, 1/8 of a point in a pre-decimalized stock market, 2.x% on a credit or paypal transaction.).",1387169722

Functional (persistent) lists are immutable. You can add elements only by creating a new data structure, similar to a linked list node, that will hold immutable references to the existing list and the new element. By convention the element is considered to be in front of the list. Hence prepending is rather easy (constant time) while appending requires rebuilding the whole list (linear time).",1387169656

6912930,comment,6912198,6912672,1,0,legutierr,,,"Your response is largely a red herring.  The primary point of my post was to say that Basic Income has nothing to do with Socialism and state intervention in the proper functioning of markets, except to the extent that taxes in general skew markets.<p>I was not asserting that the way that mixed economies work today is ideal or even desirable.  However, I was asserting that these economies have been largely successful, which it seems you disagree with.<p>I based my assertion on a simple concept: if, over the past 100 years, the parts of the world that have had mixed economies are the richest and have experienced the most industrial development, and if, in the past 30 years, countries that have embraced this mixed model have also begun to develop at a fast pace, then the model of mixed economies has been largely successful.  Furthermore, we have seen wide experimentation in the area of political economy historically over the past 150 years, and the fact that we have seen a convergence on a particular model among rich countries seems to indicate that it works.<p>Now, you seem to be judging things by a different standard, and you hint at particular examples without really doing anything more than hinting.  I&#x27;ll just assume that you are referring to certain examples.  Regarding some of these examples:<p>* Many people would assert that the problems that exist in southern Europe are primarily a result of combined European monitory policy not being matched by a combined fiscal and social policy.  Germany&#x27;s export economy thrives because southern Europe&#x27;s troubles bring down the Euro, but they don&#x27;t have to share any of the benefit because fiscal and social policy stop at the border.  Others would assert that the problems there have been exacerbated by anti-Keynesian austerity, which is the opposite of what you are asserting.<p>* Japan has a decreasing population.  My understanding is that if you look at per-capita GDP, Japan&#x27;s economy has not been doing as poorly as the absolute numbers indicate.  Japan is a very unique country, with, for instance, the lowest net-migration rate of all big economies (along with South Korea, which at least has positive population growth). Also, Keynsian policies have only recently been introduced to that country, although the jury is still out there.<p>* It remains to be seen whether or not the size of USD-denominated debt carried by the United States will ever have a negative impact on its economy.  There certainly isn&#x27;t any historical precedent of USD-denominated US debt ever being a problem for the US.<p>* Although the words &quot;failed&quot;, &quot;Keynesian&quot; and &quot;Socialist&quot; may sound good together to your ear, &quot;Keynesian&quot; is not the same as &quot;Socialist&quot; (I wrote above what &quot;Socialism&quot; is commonly defined to be), and the recent use Keynesian stimulus in the US looks more to have been a success than a failure (although only time will tell).<p>----<p>Now, regarding &quot;laissez-faire Capitalism&quot; not being present in these places: Fine!  There is none.  I&#x27;ll concede the point.  Pretend that I only wrote &quot;Capitalism&quot;.  What does that change?",1387168790

6912920,comment,6911855,6911855,4,0,Bahamut,,,"FWIW, some of the revelations in the NSA video isn&#x27;t particularly new - you can get a sense of how the NSA operates by visiting Palantir&#x27;s website (they create custom software for agencies like the NSA).  I highly suspect that the video reveals that software in action for forming links with phone metadata.<p>Contrary to a lot of what has been said on HN, a lot of what the NSA does is good for the US.  It would appear Gen. Alexander sidestepped talking about some of the questionable behavior that has occurred, but on the whole, the NSA operates with the right mindset.  Anything on foreign grounds are free reign for any country to operate in, and it has always been that way in the broader intelligence community.  The US has just been especially good at it.<p>Computing power & ability are getting ever more daunting.  The knowledge about the fragility of computers are getting ever more accessible.  What would a lot of you do about thwarting cyberthreats of varying natures to the US, were you in the position to have to protect such a powerful entity?  Would you leave the US vulnerable if it meant erring strictly on privacy, which still has the potential to be prone to mistakes?  Metadata in itself is a powerful intelligence tool.  Should the intelligence agencies never have access to it?  Under what conditions should it be available?  What would you do in the event that time is of the essence, and bureaucracy ends up preventing you from accessing the vital information you needed to stop a terrorist plot?  It is hard for people to know about what successes intelligence agencies may have - it&#x27;s a damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t situation, since the information often needs to remain classified for foreign relations, but if you fail to save lives, you are then blamed for failing your country, as the intelligence agencies were for 9/11 due to inadequate data sharing & exactly the type of bureaucracy that was later decreased.<p>I have some insight as to how the NSA operates, based on prospective employers reaching out to me for interviews, including workgroups in companies who contract directly with the NSA and the NSA itself (I was approached for a role as a mathematician as soon as their hiring freeze was over, my specialty was number theory, including analytic & algebraic number theory, precisely the NSA&#x27;s domain) - those intelligent and who have interviewed in this field should be able to extrapolate generally how the NSA likely operates without having worked there.<p>I respect the mission, and personally don&#x27;t have a huge problem with how the NSA operates.  I wouldn&#x27;t work for them ever anymore though, I picked a different career.<p>One thing I think people on HN should do though is think critically about this though, and not automatically go into scared-mode/hive-mode due to the amount of data involved.  Think it through logically, as you would with any other problem.  I think most of you would understand that this is a far more complex issue than many here have made it out to be.  One may still potentially arrive at the same conclusion that the NSA overstepped their bounds on a high moral level, but you will gain more of an appreciation for the high moral level that the NSA attempts to operate in generally, which should be a surprise if you haven&#x27;t thought about this prior to this incident given the world history of espionage and intelligence.",1387168659

Social networking is all about talking or rather communication. The noise to signal ratio is too high on social networks, and it is dominated by web robots who spam links, and in-you-face adverting that makes the social network free for the users but subjects them to all kinds of advertising even selling their personal data to scammers and spammers and large megacorporations. Sure the social network is free as in beer, but not free as in speech. You don&#x27;t have any privacy the social network records everything even the stuff you typed but didn&#x27;t send, and had to stop yourself before you sent it because it would have been embarrassing. In fact one can reasonable say the social networks take away your privacy by forcing you to use your real name and show everything you do, it takes away your rights, your freedoms, your liberties, and of course also treats you as a product instead of a human being, that they can market advertising towards in order to become billionaires.<p>Apple vs. Microsoft, we once had that with Atari vs. Commodore, we once had that with DEC vs. Wang, we once had that with IBM vs. Amdal, we once had that with Fairchild/Intel vs. TI.

Proud to be an American? Proud to be rich and privileged? Christ himself would not approve of it. Pride is one of the most dangerous of the seven deadly sins. No wonder people are leaving religion and becoming atheists, religious people aren&#x27;t being true to their religious teachings and taking up corporate teachings instead. Corporation corruption makes religious corruption, as well as political corruption, as well as social corruption, as well as cultural corruption as well as environmental corruption as well as economic corruption, and then even science corruption and technological corruption that leads to poor quality products that last less than three years and are made with the cheapest labor in the worst of all conditions in a third world nation using child labor and slavery.

BTW more money is spent on studying climate change than actually finding alternatives to fossil fuels and greener technology and greener programming to save electricity? What&#x27;s up with that? We cut NASA&#x27;s space program for the war on terror and then cut it some more to study climate change. Now our space program is a joke as China puts a robot on the Moon, and our space shuttle is recycled 1980&#x27;s tech and mothballed.<p>The number of mentally ill people keeps on rising. There is no empathy and compassion for the mentally ill anymore. Since a mental illness is &#x27;invisible&#x27; most people think the mentally ill are faking it and are really &#x27;pretentious douchebags&#x27; who should just &#x27;snap out of it&#x27; and get back to work. All public programs to treat the mentally ill got cut after 9/11 in the USA in order to fund NSA spying and security with the TSA and other agencies. Leaving the mentally ill with little or no support options. Dropping out of college because that college could no support them due to lack of funding by the government. So one neuroscience student the system failed, shot up a Batman movie in Colorado as &quot;The Joker&quot; who was mentally ill. Another failed college student shot up a school in Newtown and was mentally ill. The Navy Base Shooter was also mentally ill talking about ELF radiation controlling him. In all three cases they begged for help, talked about killing people, but got no help and no support. They were just swept under the rug and ignored, until they got really violent and off their meds and got some guns and did some shootings. But the mentally ill are vilified now. The news media only focuses on the 10% of the mentally ill that do violent crimes, won&#x27;t tell you that 90% are non-violent and in need of help, support, empathy, and compassion. <a href=\"http://blastar.in/crawfraud/?p=143\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blastar.in/crawfraud/?p=143</a><p>Still it is a human problem of hating those who are different than you in some way.

In other words, it&#x27;s social order, underwritten by the majoritarian mass, that allows bankers and programmers to get rich instead of warlords. In a world where the majority isn&#x27;t underwriting social order and the rule of law, there remains a ruling minority class, but they&#x27;re different people than the ones that are rich under the existing system.

Consider that, for vanilla Strings, the buffer ops are implemented like so:<p><pre><code>    buf_append bufOps = (++)\n    buf_concat bufOps = concat\n</code></pre>\nSince (++) has a running time that&#x27;s linear in the length of its left argument, you want to treat it as a right-associative operator to prevent quadratic runtime when joining a bunch of strings.<p>But, going back to the patch in question, the original code was effectively this:<p><pre><code>    foldr (flip (++)) [] strs\n</code></pre>\nSince <i>flip</i> had been applied to (++), the resulting operator you now want to treat as left associative to avoid quadratic blow-up.  The code, however, uses the right-associative fold, <i>foldr</i>, to join the list of strings <i>str</i>.<p>The patch fixes this problem by replacing the code with the equivalent code<p><pre><code>    concat (reverse strs)\n</code></pre>\nAnd how is <i>concat</i> defined in the libraries?

The advantage of the basic income is that it&#x27;s very simple and there are no mathematical gymnastics needed to neither discourage work or produce a very high marginal income tax rate as you leave the NIT.

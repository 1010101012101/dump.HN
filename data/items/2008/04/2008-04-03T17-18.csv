154051,comment,153812,153812,0,0,hernan7,,,"In my opinion, if you don't learn Lisp at school, picking it up later in your spare time is going to be quite a task.<p>After reading and doing the exercises from the Touretzky book and The Little Schemer, plus some articles here and there on the 'Net my experience was:<p>1) Lisps have their annoyances like all languages. Lots of little non-intuitive keywords to memorize, the dotted pairs, quite the baroque computation model (variables having sub-variables, etc.), the FOR syntax, DO, etc. Not a deal breaker, but annoying. (Touretzky seems to fixate excessively on some of these weird traits of Lisp.)<p>2) If your Math chops are rusty, you are going to have to work twice as hard. Mine are, and I had to. If you are fresh from taking your Computability Theory course, then recursion and infix are going to be second nature. If you haven't been doing Math for a while, it's going to be hard. Another reason to learn Lisp while in college.<p>3) You can learn the syntax in 2 hours, yes, but to really know Lisp you need to really understand recursion, continuations, thunks, macros, multiple dispatch, all the fine points of object orientation (to understand the CLOS) and who knows what else. Basically, you need to have a deep understanding of, well, all of CS? This is not something that can be learned on your spare time unless you have lots of it.<p>In my case, I am starting The Seasoned Schemer now, and taking it slowly, under no illusion that I am going to learn Lisp any time soon. I may well be that I am one of those ""stupid programmers"" that are unsuited for Lisp. Oh well...",1207244909
154050,comment,153812,153812,0,0,docmach,,,"One problem I have with Lisp is that there are a lot more fanatics than in other languages' communities.  They are easily upset by even the mention of other languages and seem to see Lisp as the ultimate language with no room for any others.  This produces blog and newsgroup posts extolling the virtues of Lisp and telling everyone who doesn't love Lisp that there is something wrong with them.  People who say they know Lisp and still choose to use other languages are looked at as particularly defective.  It's not just that they don't want to use other languages, it's more like they don't want other languages to exist.  They spend at least as much time trying to make other languages look bad as they do trying to make Lisp look good.<p>I know this doesn't describe everyone who uses Lisp, but these fanatics are very vocal and the reason I stopped reading comp.lang.lisp and decided to try other languages.  I am not against being excited about a language and trying to convince other people to use it.  I love Haskell and tell people about how wonderful it is all the time, but I understand that they have reasons for using the tools they do.  I am more interested in the theory of a language than in how good it is at solving some practical problem, but some people don't care at all about theory and just want to get things done.  I don't understand why, but I accept it.  I think that the most important thing the Lisp community can do to be more popular is to be friendly to newcomers and those who disagree about Lisp's superiority.  There are some very helpful and friendly people, they just need to be more vocal and drown out those who are not.",1207244788

154046,comment,153812,153974,0,0,0x44,,,"On the contrary, I'm suggesting that Lisp dialects do not diverge as far from each other as the various dynamic languages do. That means that the idiosyncrasies each dialect has are going to be more glaring. The other dynamic languages don't (yet) have dialects, so you don't have to take the design decisions of the interpreter into consideration - after you've decided on the language.<p>In that case, I think that there might be a better chance of a sub-set of Lisp dialects becoming popular if they were described as separate languages. It will be interesting to see how Arc develops from MzScheme, and whether or not it becomes more popular with non-Lispers.",1207244617

154039,comment,153558,153721,0,0,dusklight,,,"1. So what do you want to do about it? Are you going to force all these smart young people to stop joining google? Pass a law banning tech companies from giving out free gourmet food?<p>2. What you don't seem to realize is that the existing college curriculum in almost all US colleges, including the ivy league ones, do not correctly prepare a student for a real software engineering environment. Sure it's nice to learn all about algorithms and patterns and all that stuff, but until you actually dive into being part of a million-line project, you don't really know what it's like. Google is providing valuable real-world training to these freshies, using throw-away projects, well except sometimes one of those throw-away projects becomes something real and important. They also are creating a new generation of elite programmers who are setting new expectations in the marketplace such as:<p><pre><code>        a. Only technical people should manage technical people.
        b. Programmers should be given the freedom to innovate and exercise their creativity.
        c. Programmers should be pampered and treated to luxury so that they don't have to worry about anything other than coding.
</code></pre>
You say that all these Google people are likely to stay at Google -- well that will remain true only if other companies don't start providing the same types of perks and environment as Google. Empirically we can already see that Facebook is doing just fine competing with Google for quality employees. Smaller companies can be competitive too -- ask Fog Creek (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDeveloper...</a>) if they have problems attracting quality candidates.<p>3. There are already TONS of startups started by ex-googlers, so in short, what I see, is not that Google is sucking up all this smart talent and then wasting them on creating ad-space. What I see is Google is gathering all this untrained potential, adding engineering discipline and high expectations from employers, and then letting them loose to spawn their own innovations.<p>4. In my personal experience, jealousy and whining makes you feel better temporarily, but they don't really solve any problems and they just keep you stuck in your current mode so that you forget to look for real solutions to your real problems. When you are a child, if you fall down and start crying, your mommy or some other adult will come over and pick you up and make you feel better again. When you become an adult you have to pick yourself up.",1207244032
154038,comment,153812,154005,0,0,tfinniga,,,"Good points.  Perhaps the problem is also how lisp is taught?  When I learned lisp, the procedural aspects of lisp were shown, but with the understanding that they were bad, and not to be used.  Probably because it was shown as a  functional language, and was meant to be used as such.  Similar to how, say, c++'s functional programming capabilities aren't really taught.<p>If the indentation is sufficient, why not just remove the parens completely and rely on indentation?<p>Lisp does have an advantage in being regular, which might not be worth giving up, and Algol descendants are kind of a mishmash, to be fair.  To be honest, I'm not enough of a lisp user to be able to know what a good solution is for this one.  Maybe changing some function names would be useful.. for example 'add' is better than '+', which I read as 'plus'.  Repurposing infix symbols as prefix symbols seems problematic.<p>If I were redesigning the language, one of the more important things I'd change is the keywords and builtins.  For example, head and tail seem a lot better to me than car and cdr.  A lot of lisp's keywords and functions come from math,  and I'd probably change them to reflect mainstream algorithm design instead.",1207244009

If we can just make the change in the workflow engine, we can deploy it straight to production.""<p>Perhaps a workflow engine keeps you from shooting yourself in the foot by constraining kinds of things you can modify in your system.  However, change control processes also protect your organization from all sorts of things: fraud, business rule errors, etc.  I once worked for an organization where project managers wanted to put business logic in the database because they were allowed to change it at will!  Just because changes don't fall within the scope of your change control processes doesn't mean that those changes are safe to do at will.  This is the same fallacy that led people to believe that SOAP was great because it could get through firewalls.  The only reason admins would punch large HTTP holes in their firewalls was because they believed the risk of serving up web pages was relatively low, monitored, and contained.<p>2.  ""Coding is done by expensive software developers.  Business uses can make these changes if we implement a workflow engine.""<p>It's not syntax that keeps non-coders from becoming decent developers.  It's the ability to think in a structured, logical way. And, for anything but the most trivial uses of a workflow engine, one must be able to think through business processes in a way that only software development trains you for.  What are the holes in this process?  What happens if an employee quits who has active workflow items?  How are they re-assigned?  For years, business rule vendors (iLog, Blaze, etc.) have been making similar claims.  In practice, I have seen that business rule system users are only allowed to make configuration changes (15% discount on Tuesdays instead of 20%) rather than more dynamic changes to rules (which are just declarative code).<p>With all this said, I still like the concept of jBPM and other workflow engines.

8421914,comment,8421469,8421599,0,0,roc,,,"It&#x27;s popular to suggest this is a symptom of the paltry entry-level storage -- but I think that&#x27;s naive.  People&#x27;s storage use expands to the capacity of their device. Even if the entry level was 64GB, Apple would see this effect. [1]<p>As these devices are increasingly sold to people who have never plugged them into a PC running iTunes, the storage problem is exacerbated: without being able to dump everything to a (cheap) external drive, users agonize over which memories to delete and many simply balk at the entire process.  And this isn&#x27;t just a problem with updates: people struggle with this during regular use.<p>So what we have is really two problems: no space to update and no way to simply/effectively/cheaply archive device data.  So what is needed are two solutions:<p>1. Apple needs to reserve storage space for updates. [2]<p>2. Mobile devices, in general, need a PC-free way to bulk-archive data.  Cloud services are great and all, but people are far more likely to walk into a Best Buy and pick up an external drive, than they are to find/vet/pay for Flickr.  And even if they&#x27;re willing to pay for the service, most are not willing to pay the hosting fees for the quantity of digital memories they&#x27;re creating.  And if you can&#x27;t save <i>everything</i>, you&#x27;re just back at the same problem of asking people to explicitly cast memories into the void, and they just won&#x27;t do it.  Not happily. Not willingly.  And they&#x27;ll resent every instance where they feel forced.<p>We&#x27;re well past the point where the value in this arrangement was obvious.<p>Why iOS devices, in particular, can&#x27;t talk directly to Time Capsules (for device backup and a local media archive) is beyond me.  It&#x27;s particularly curious that Apple is ignoring the situation, given that they don&#x27;t seek to profit from being a cloud provider, and would stand to make a decent chunk of change from putting a Time Capsule (or three) into every iOS home.  They could even leverage the AppleTV as yet-another-viewer of this home-archived media and sell a few more of those.<p>I know it&#x27;s popular to assume this is all inevitably going &quot;to the cloud&quot;. But there&#x27;s simply too much data being collected.  People marvel at how much data is being uploaded to Youtube/Facebook/Instagram/etc.  But for every picture or video uploaded to those services, how much data did that one user capture that they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> upload?  And then consider how many users are capturing similar amounts of data but never upload <i>anything</i>.<p>The growth rate of data capture is far exceeding the growth \nrate of bandwidth and the affordability of &quot;enough&quot; cloud storage. It&#x27;s going to be years and years until cloud storage is &quot;there&quot;.  There&#x27;s a huge opportunity in the interim.<p>Beyond iOS, I don&#x27;t know how every storage vendor doesn&#x27;t have their own android solution to the problem.  Solving this problem can sell an awful lot of hard drives.  That you&#x27;re explicitly selling the safe archive of precious memories is going to mean you can sell a higher number of RAID solutions as well.  And the growth rate of captured data means you&#x27;ve got a huge market for selling additional/newer storage devices to your installed base.<p>[1] Desktop users don&#x27;t fill multi-terabyte hard drives as often, only inasmuch as they don&#x27;t connect high quality data capture devices.  Hand a person a DSLR or a GoPro and they&#x27;ll fill every drive they buy.  Mobile devices fill more-quickly, more-regularly, largely because they all have high quality cameras built in.<p>[2]  The updates themselves probably should be smaller at this point, but you&#x27;d always need room for a full restore anyway. So shrinking the update sizes is really only a bandwidth concern and can&#x27;t lead to a reduction in the reserved space.",1412697572

But for the time being it&#x27;s still inevitably going to be very deadly, although mutations to less severe forms would be advantageous.

But iOS8 doesn&#x27;t work on the iPhone 4, and according to comments on here works pretty terribly on the 4S, and even on the 5.<p>Supporting the current version and the most recent version doesn&#x27;t feel like the biggest imposition. As a web developer we&#x27;ve adopted it - we just phased out iOS6 support now that we&#x27;re looking at iOS8. And there aren&#x27;t actually that many differences between 7 and 8 - especially compared to 6 and 7. What iOS8-specific SDK features are developers using that means they absolutely have to only target iOS8?",1412697154

If member functions return objects and data, they can be used in a functional approach and to construct polymorphism or inheritance through currying.<p><i>Are the OOP language features the essence of OOP? &#x27;Everything is an object&#x27;? Multiple inheritance?</i><p>if an object can be reduced to a symbol like a void-pointer to data or a function that returns data and this object can be related to others on a graph, then that&#x27;s still general enough.<p>Imperative Programms as well as Object models can be well organized in graphs. The CPU or bytecode doesn&#x27;t know about objects anyway. So it&#x27;s an abstraction and you need to applay that in a moderate fashion, depending on the complexity of the problem, so for simple or efficient procedures imperative style is not to be replaced by OOP. fopen, fread etc. all are abstractions of underying system calls, but depend on speed, so light OOP is a good fit there,",1412696590

Ever tried to integrate Django or Celery into a project whose configuration comes from .ini files or some other method? You end up writing your own configuration layer to get something that Django approves of.

With something like Pyramid I never find myself following a debugger down into the guts to understand why it is or isn&#x27;t doing something -- I have to do this all the time with Django because some piece of magic isn&#x27;t working as advertised.<p>Ultimately, something like Django is concerned with &quot;how can I make it work?&quot; What professional engineers should be concerned with are questions like &quot;what happens when it doesn&#x27;t work?&quot; and &quot;will someone else be able to understand this?&quot; With Django, what happens when it doesn&#x27;t work is you find yourself about 13 levels deep in the stack looking at some wrapper class in this giant framework. If you do have to get into a Pyramid component, most of them are actually just individual projects, a single developer can understand the whole thing.<p>The entire work of engineering is to make it work, without also making it comprehensible to others and easily serviceable -- and do it fast.

This is pretty silly; any user of a platform without a filesystem would surely know that chdir would not be supported.<p>Beyond that kind of indefensible omission, there is much ecosystem fragmentation and duplicated effort that could be solved by standardizing tools like a package manager without <i>requiring</i> you to install it on embedded targets.",1412696127

I&#x27;d upgraded from iOS 6 to 7 simply because I needed HipChat and FourSquare for professional reasons, and both companies had completely dropped support for iOS 6. And then upgraded to iOS 8 because I know the same thing is going to happen again. I don&#x27;t criticize Apple so much for creating new iOS versions that require greater processor power -- I criticize the app developers which force us to upgrade to OS&#x27;s our phones can&#x27;t support.

Find an old QST or QEX or other electronics magazine from the 90s and look at proud pix of projects and for the vast majority WRT appearance its at best early leather and steel man cave and at worst if you don&#x27;t have a technical background it totally looks like junk and its all adult with adult risks and adult tools.  Modern maker is all about the art and the kids and you&#x27;re only going to see bright colors and flowing lines and proportions and whimsy on maker stuff, not old school ham radio / electronic dude stuff.  Some machinist hand made steam engines do look beautiful in my opinion but that also drifts into the non-technical public probably thinking it looks like junk.<p>I&#x27;ve been to maker fair, and I&#x27;ve been to too many ham radio fests to count.  Just looking at the tables, at the artistic style of stuff and the tools you can tell if you&#x27;re at a maker fair or a ham fest.<p>I feel less confident about camp and &quot;not real&quot;.  Maker seems to be a lot of self referential &quot;learn some skills to do something real&quot; &quot;make believe&quot; type of stuff.  So you get a laser cut robot that kinda walks and is very whimsical and artsy and kids can safely assemble it, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything and its unclear what you&#x27;d do with it after its made.  The ham culture is more like here&#x27;s a 1500 watt linear amplifier and yes the power supply is quite easily capable of killing you if you aren&#x27;t careful in design, construction, operation, and maintenance so kids are totally not allowed and once its done you talk to the other side of the planet using morse code on 20 meters or bounce digital waveforms off the moon on 2 meters, and not being a maker project it will have all the artistic appeal and style of a beige box PC or a filing cabinet, even if it does have technologically cutting edge intermodulation and linearity specs.  Or old school non-maker is like a table saw that almost demonically wants to rip your hand off at the wrist but if you&#x27;re a sober and careful and methodical adult it makes beautiful carpentry projects, but from an art perspective, its an ugly metal table with a spinning blood hungry saw wheel of death in the center, and thats about it, not exactly &quot;maker&quot; in kid-safety or artistic style.",1412695026

8421591,comment,8420199,8421488,1,0,pron,,,"I prefer a much more pragmatic approach. From where I stand, statically-typed FP languages like Haskell are very interesting but are still in the research stage. We don&#x27;t even know that that&#x27;s a direction worth adopting in mainstream languages. Some ideas (pattern matching) are easy to understand, but others? Personally, I think static types going beyond those offered by Java could be very beneficial, but I&#x27;m not convinced that the type systems used by Haskell or Scala are the way to go.<p>We do know that FP does allow for more general abstractions, but those usually come at a cost. They are harder for people to understand, and frankly, haven&#x27;t been proven to increase code quality and maintainability. Yes, they&#x27;re elegant like mathematical equations, but equations don&#x27;t need to be changed and maintained by large teams of people over many years. A language like Haskell gives you more tools to think of your program ahead of time at the expense of thinking about it when it runs (with a debugger, profiler etc.), and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the tradeoff the industry should make. Math is a great tool, but I&#x27;d learn how to catch a ball a lot faster by trial and error, then by learning how to rigorously compute its trajectory.<p>I think people in the industry should wait for more evidence of the utility of the more advanced FP  concepts before rushing to adopt them. Of course, that doesn&#x27;t mean people should be working on novel approaches and trying them. But my problem with Scala is that it is really a research language that tries different unproven approaches (and that answers pretty much all your questions about why certain features were ever included -- that and the non discriminating taste of its designers). But it&#x27;s dangerous because it tricks people into thinking it&#x27;s something else.",1412694793

But the OP postulates that through force of state having safety criteria restaurants must advertise is a systemic benefit to the food service industry, and if it actually <i>was</i>, then restaurants everywhere would naturally adopt it if it increases consumer participation and revenues.<p>More than anything I&#x27;m trying to indicate that safety ratings are not actually benefiting the restaurants if they are not adopting similar systems elsewhere. And if they had a private rating system it would only mean anything if there was some consortium that posted standards. Consider the ESRB, which is not a state review board but exists to keep states from instituting review boards in the US on video games. They specify their rating criteria in available records and are utilized industry wide because the users of the rating board find it a net benefit.<p>I&#x27;m not going to argue that consumers do not benefit somewhat from food safety ratings, but it is also not purely black and white, because by compelling restaurants to produce them, if they are not a market positive effect (and like I said, the lack of a natural appearance of such a system outside mandate indicates it is most likely not) then the consumer pays for those reviews with a more significant expense on the part of restaurants than the restaurants make as a result of increased traffic, which means they must raise prices systemically to compensate, and you end up paying more.<p>Except in a sane market, you should be able to pay more if you want to only shop at restaurants that give safety ratings from some public consortium in the first place.

Go is more concise. You might not care, but I do.<p>2. Go uses explicit error return codes.<p>My experience is that practically and counter intuitively, explicit error return codes (that have to be explicitly checked for errors) result in more robust code than exceptions (checked or not). YMMV.<p>Java the Virtual Machine:<p>1. Go produces single file native binaries. You may not care, but if you do, that&#x27;s a win.<p>Java the Ecosystem:<p>1. Go interfaces to C more easily;<p>2.

I ride my bike or walk to work/town literally 365 days of the year. Friends were Bison hunting a few winters back below -55C - and they were sleeping in a wall tent :) They had to wake up every hour to stoke the stove, and it took them a full day to get their snowmobiles running so they could ride ~100km on them back to the world. Not the kind of place you want to make a mistake.<p>It doesn&#x27;t snow much here (semi-arid) so we don&#x27;t get whiteout conditions.<p>Our local community ski will close when it&#x27;s past about -30C - so we can&#x27;t go skiing on the chair lift then - on those days I go snowshoeing or ice fishing usually.<p>Friends up in the Arctic Circle in places like Iqaluit [1] have told me they have 20 or 30 days a winter where it&#x27;s impossible to go outside - it&#x27;s such severe whiteout and wind you would get lost and literally die if you went outside.

I learned about things I would never use (and probably still haven&#x27;t).<p>I pushed myself to recompile the kernel even though I didn&#x27;t need to. Then I did it probably 50 more times that month. No joke. Crashed my system. Rebuilt it. Rinse, repeat.<p>After laying down that foundation in the 90s, I&#x27;ve kept up on it but Linux is so very &quot;easy&quot; for me. Setting things up and getting work done is extremely intuitive, far more so than it is in Windows or OSX. So when people ask me why I prefer it I tell them it&#x27;s a personal preference because it&#x27;s so easy for me, and I even I forget that foundation I laid.<p>I have taken on other pursuits the same way, such as development but I notice any technology that I half ass learn just to get stuff done.. is hard. Sometimes I wish I had enough time in my adult life to build such a strong foundation in something like.. JavaScript for example. And I bet if I added up the time I spent struggling in the beginning I would have been able to do just that.<p>But yeah, long story short this is absolutely the best way to learn something.

You can&#x27;t claim that you want the oppose of abandoning evidence based medicine and simultaneously claim you want people to stop rejecting things due to lack of evidence.<p>> If individuals or groups of people claim a benefit from something, why should that be rejected without proper investigation?<p>There&#x27;s a difference between rejecting something as a justified claim and rejecting it as a hypothesis for which there may be reason for further investigation -- the former is warranted more often than the latter, though even the latter can be warranted when, in addition to a lack of evidence for the claimed causal mechanism, there is a lack of evidence for the phenomenon it explains, or where there is evidence for the phenomenon but there is also sufficient evidence to conclude that an alternative cause to the proposed one was at work.<p>n=1 studies of treatments for medical conditions frequently suffer from either or both of these problems; particularly the first, as they generally lack sufficient evidence that improvement outside of the range plausible without any intervention occurred.<p>> I stand by my claim that Iodine and Magnesium cured my asthma and I have test data to back it up.<p>As iodine deficiency depresses immune function and asthma symptoms are commonly triggered by respiratory infections (either alone or in combination with other environmental factors), I don&#x27;t think anyone concerned with evidence-based medicine would be surprised that there are people for whom increasing iodine intake reduced or eliminated asthma symptoms. Iodine also has other well-established effects that relate directly to known risk factors for asthma.<p>> But your doctor is unlikely to recommend it and no company is going to do clinical trials.<p>Sure, your doctor is unlikely, absent other evidence indicative of an iodine deficiency, to conclude that your asthma is due to an iodine deficiency and recommend that as an appropriate intervention. Because its not particularly likely to be true or an effective intervention.<p>OTOH, with symptoms that are more closely tied to an iodine deficiency, they are likely to test for that (and with test results showing such a deficiency, they are likely to recommend iodine to correct it.)<p>I imagine similar things are generally true of magnesium.",1420563053

- Really good faculty that cared not just about tech, but about teaching
- Really good curriculum that fosters basic CS skills and an &#x27;engineering mindset&#x27; instead of just &#x27;learning Rails&#x27;
- Fosters an attitude that encourages learning for learning&#x27;s sake
- Great support through the job placement system.<p>What was not so great:
- You really can&#x27;t come in with 0 experience and come out a competent developer. Most of the people in the program had at least some prior familiarity with coding, even if the experience was shallow.
- Instruction focuses on the students at the middle of the individual semester&#x27;s bell curve. Students with no experience (or lacking basic computer skills) can get left behind, students with way more experience (or more aptitude) can get bored.
- To me, the average salary touted by the school is inflated. Most people seem to have landed in jobs that pay around 50-60k initially, although many people are able to move to higher paying positions quickly.<p>I haven&#x27;t personally been through the GA bootcamp, but I know two people who have and have worked/interviewed with others that have. GA seems to not really give a shit about actually educating people or getting them jobs, just about making sure they pay tuition. There is little to no job counseling, instructors are of (at best) mixed quality, and the curriculum is extremely confused.<p>Like anything else that you&#x27;re going to spend 12k on, do your research before you commit. Some schools are great, some are not, and what you get out of it always depends on what you put into it. Look for one (like flatiron) with great job placement, and connections to companies.<p>Additionally, the idea that &#x27;most companies&#x27; require a CS degree for web devs is just not true. Most job postings that are out in the wild might ask for that, but most companies hire new devs through job placement services, or connections that can vouch for the skills of non-degreed developers, rather than through cattle call services like Linkedin, Craigslist, etc.",1420562822

Go does not have generics, see the 50,000 blog posts for details.
Go has less boilerplate than java but still some (mainly it is explicit in checking for errors).
Go has built in HTTP server, and you don&#x27;t have to deal with containers, application servers, etc.

The thing is, the version of Pascal used at Apple had been extended to the point where there were really few differences between the two languages.<p>- C used curly braces, Pascal used BEGIN/END. Whatever.<p>- C didn&#x27;t have strings, really; they were broken. Pascal had strings, but of limited length (e.g., Str255), and thus they were pretty broken. Different pain points, but string handling in either language was not much fun.<p>- C had short circuit operators; Pascal didn&#x27;t. This was the most painful thing to deal with.<p>- C had pointer arithmetic. Pascal had been extended to provide it, too (but didn&#x27;t do type scaling, so you had to do this manually).<p>- C didn&#x27;t have nested procedures. Pascal did, but people mostly used them for hiding (the equivalent of &#x27;static&#x27; scope function in C).<p>After a couple of months it no longer mattered what I was writing code in. Apple&#x27;s Pascal had been extended to be semantically so close to C that I barely noticed.<p>A couple years later Apple more or less stopped writing new code in Pascal (everything was in C++, or at least C) and by the early 90s Pascal was all but gone, except for a few holdouts such as the AppleScript group.<p>I don&#x27;t have fond memories of the unextended Pascal compilers I had to use in college.

It&#x27;s probably safe to say that anything currently simulating our reality, at least in this context, ultimately stemmed from a mature superintelligence.<p>><i>Note that Roko&#x27;s Basilisk even posits a Friendly AI. That is, one that is imbued with respect for human values, but that may simply consider &quot;threatening the past&quot; with torture a necessity in order to ensure it is created as a moral imperative to minimize human suffering.</i><p>One could argue that such an AI would not truly be friendly. Indeed, what you said resembles something of a cold, uncaring utility function run amok.<p>><i>Note that such a Friendly AI would have reason to carry out this threat even if it believes it exists and so has been created, because it will not know whether it is a &quot;full version&quot; running in reality, or a partial, restricted, time limited simulation by people trying to figure out whether or not Roko&#x27;s Basilisk holds before deciding whether to let it loose in their reality.</i><p>This may be moot, assuming that the advent of superintelligence significantly predates, or at least is a prerequisite for, the simulation of entire realities. If people in an ancestor simulation are trying to see if the Basilisk holds via simulation of a child reality, then the ancestor reality almost certainly has a superintelligent agent present within to facilitate that.<p>As an aside, ontological issues that superintelligent agents may encounter are an interesting facet of the control problem. Especially when you consider that a superintelligence would likely figure out the secrets of the universe in short order, far beyond what humans have been capable of learning.<p>><i>Then again, there may very well be one or more fundamental flaws in the entire argument, ...</i><p>Lack of evidence. Without any, there&#x27;s no reason to lend any more credence to Roko&#x27;s basilisk than there is to the notion of space aliens living amongst us, perfectly manipulating our perceptions so as to conceal themselves.<p>Both scenarios are entirely possible. But we lack evidence for either. Hence, they should receive the same weight: zero.<p>><i>But it&#x27;s fun to think about.</i><p>In a sort of soul-crushing kind of way, it sure is.",1420561887

The entry-level candidate might even apply for the senior level job posting, whereas a senior candidate is unlikely to apply for entry-level jobs.<p>I&#x27;ve had some experience with bootcamp grads over the past couple years, as they have applied to jobs I had posted (I recruit engineers). Based on my experience, the bootcamps seem to do a good job of building confidence in their grads, although that might be a trait of people who go to bootcamps (those confident that they can change careers in 10 weeks).<p>I believe there was also a trend of some bootcamps to hire their own grads in some capacity, which could skew the numbers a bit.",1420561788

On the website there is no link to information about the application, no documentation, no videos, no blog posts, nothing. Instead, I, and the software&#x27;s target audience, are users of the Github.com already, and we know how to use github.com already, there is a plethora of docs, wikis, blog posts, videos which help us on using it on the web.

I understand what you&#x27;re saying, and from the looks of the upvotes, you&#x27;re not alone.<p>However, a common thought for people who experience issues like these is that they bother other people. Their problem is not important, they are being a burden onto others, &c. This leads them to reach out only very late, sometimes not at all. That&#x27;s why suicide hotlines (just an example, clearly not the case for op) are so adamant about their &quot;we&#x27;ll just listen, feel free to talk, we won&#x27;t call the cops&quot; policy.<p>So, to the OP, and to anyone else with similar issues reading this: feel free to reach out, please do, it&#x27;s no burden.<p>To anyone else: yes, it&#x27;s a hijack, but please consider ignoring it and just letting it sit naturally at the 1 point bottom of the thread. Downvoting and explicitly mentioning how these cries for help are &quot;inappropriate&quot; or otherwise negative, while conforming to the guidelines, can have a bad effect. Both on the poster, and other readers who identify. I&#x27;d posit it&#x27;s worth it to just ignore, in this case.<p>Thanks.",1420561307

Melanogenesis happens when skin cells are exposed to UV light which the human eye cannot see in the first place. UV light exposure only happens when you are outside as glass blocks UV light.

Even if blind people could sense melanin being generated (which they obviously can&#x27;t) you would have to expose them to so much UV light that they will feel it by being burnt and not by sensing it on some mystical cellular level.
And Vitamin D? that&#x27;s even more far fetched than the melanin theory...<p>Some clinically blind people with no eye damage do maintain the ability to distinguish between light and dark, that&#x27;s due to certain cells in the cornea which are light sensitive and still maintain a neural connection to the brain.<p>People who are legally blind say a really bad case of cataract sill have light vision and usually can identify shapes and see a very very blurry and narrow image of their environment but those are not clinically blind.",1420560956

The most useful rule of thumb I&#x27;ve come across is to consider imperative to be concerned with HOW something is to be done, while declarative concerns primarily WHAT is supposed to be done.<p>SQL is usually classified as declarative in that you&#x27;re not telling the database how to retrieve the top ten entries from a table - you&#x27;re merely informing it that you are interested in those entries.<p>It struck me at some point that this definition must be relative to the level of abstraction you&#x27;re operating at. For example, when using (go …) blocks, I&#x27;m declaring that I want the code contained within the block to be processed asynchronously, but I&#x27;m not describing how that is to be done. Perhaps a callback might be described as being &quot;more imperative&quot; since it contains more implementation details?<p>So, am I correct in thinking that this discussion would hinge on what you consider to be &quot;concrete&quot; and not?

Of course the imperial powers wiped out a lot of native tribes, but all it takes is one success by a digitally replicating capable of learning enemy...<p>The more likely doom scenario is related to godhood.  Sure a godlike power is capable of wiping out humans, but we&#x27;ve had our own power structures supporting themselves by propagandizing for millennia that &quot;our&quot; godlike superiors always help us wipe out our enemies because our cause is right and just or whatever, at least until it doesn&#x27;t work and they&#x27;re replaced by a new batch telling the same old story.  So what worked as a paleo-conservative success strategy for millennia when talking about something imaginary, might not work when it collides with something real created by ourselves.  Or even worse, collides with a strategy that actually works that&#x27;s being run by another tribe.<p>Another interesting doom scenario is of course MAD, although now it only requires a team of programmers to play along, instead of a massive industrial complex.  Sooner or later somebody&#x27;s deadman switch will trip or a cult does the equivalent of drinking kool-aid then the party starts.",1420560071

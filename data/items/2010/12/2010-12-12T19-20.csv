As usual, the people who ship will win. Good luck with all the wrangling of the big vendors to change a tiny bit of syntax, I'll be happily sitting here writing CoffeeScript <i>today</i>.<p>All that's missing is a layer of tooling in modern browsers (Chrome, FF) that make it so you can look at CoffeeScript as if it were in the browser, and the abstraction would be pretty complete. You'll still have to precompile the stuff on your server, which sucks, but practically speaking we're not talking about anything that can't be clean and easy to use without appropriate tools. Generally speaking client side code is short and sweet, so running your system in development mode where the script compiles on the client and doing a full compile server side for production mode isn't that far off from doing a debug vs release build in the world of native apps.",1292183959

It's easy and much faster.</i><p>Don't do this.<p>Doubling the size of your allocation whenever you expand can easily lead to large amounts of wasted storage in common scenarios.  ""Yes,"" you may say.  ""But memory is cheap.""  Which it is at the small scale, but when you're allocating 1GB to store a 512MB array you have a problem.<p>A vastly better approach is to use some form of adaptive rescaling which avoids excessive overcommits.<p>Here, for example, is the code (and explanatory comment) Python uses to determine the new allocation size for an expanding list:<p><pre><code>        /* This over-allocates proportional to the list size, making room
         * for additional growth.  The over-allocation is mild, but is
         * enough to give linear-time amortized behavior over a long
         * sequence of appends() in the presence of a poorly-performing
         * system realloc().
         * The growth pattern is:  0, 4, 8, 16, 25, 35, 46, 58, 72, 88, ...
         */
        new_allocated = (newsize >> 3) + (newsize < 9 ? 3 : 6) + newsize;
        if (newsize == 0)
                new_allocated = 0;
</code></pre>
Note that you will also want to avoid using the same calculation for expanding and contracting the allocation size, to avoid thrashing allocations when the list size varies around the pivot point.  (i.e., add one element, triggering an expansion; remove the element, triggering a contraction; repeat.)",1292183558

This anti-Perl snobbery hasn't seemed to have hurt them any.<p>Or how about the snobbery of C users against COBOL and FORTRAN?  Once again, C got adopted despite (or perhaps even because) of it.<p>Or the religious wars over static vs dynamic typing, functional vs imperative, OO vs procedural, and which editor or OS is superior.<p>This kind of elitism is really endemic in the programming field, is by no means restricted to Lisp, and is probably not very relevant to the lack of adoption of Lisp in the general programming community.<p>Rather, I'd chalk it up to more of a matter of marketing.  Lisp is still viewed as more of a (difficult) academic language, rather than a practical one.  It's also rather old by now, and doesn't have the shiny/new sparkle that helped Java and Perl (in their day), and Ruby and Python (more recently).

School, at least in its current implementation, is a supremely flawed model for many of the reasons discussed in this thread and elsewhere.  The solution is not to just do away with it though - while for some of us this would be liberating, for a far greater number of people it would be harmful.  Anarchy, be it political, economic, or educational, rarely generates cut and dry improvement.<p>As someone who has many issues with education, and has felt openly hostile toward it previously, for me adopting a relaxed attitude about it was the most important step.  I realized I could go to classes, engage with professors and other students, and do reasonably well in terms of marks without allowing grades or assignments to impact my external intellectual curiosity.  I've been much happier, and much more productive both inside and outside of school, since I let go of the frustration with ""the system"" and put the focus on myself.",1292183026

For me, the power of BDD (it's really still just TDD but let's not open that can of worms further...) is in the process.<p>I'm not a fan of RSpec; however, I also find Steak just a little too minimalist for me.<p>Occasionally, I want very badly to be able to render my Scenarios to plain text for communication with customers and other developers.  I need the individual steps for that as well.<p>Where the example here maintains the steps (eg., Given, when, and then) as comments, I prefer them in the code.<p>So I wrote Coulda (<a href=""http://coulda.tiggerpalace.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coulda.tiggerpalace.com/</a>) a bit over a year ago.  Yes, it uses Test::Unit.  While I am in the minority, I still prefer Test::Unit.  It scales well.<p>When I say that, I mean in the sense that I can write almost any test using just ""assert"" and then add an error message for when the assert fails.  I don't limit myself to using solely ""assert""; however, when I'm not sure how to write an assertion, and neither shoulda nor Test::Unit gives it to me, it's easy to build it using ""assert"" and then wrapping it in a method (making it a helper).<p>And I still find Test::Unit code readable enough.  Maybe that's just a matter of taste.<p>Dare I add: RSpec, although cleaner with the release of RSpec 2.0, is still a very complicated swiss army knife.  Miniunit, included in Ruby 1.9.1 but also available as a gem for older Ruby installs, is the basis for Test::Unit as Ruby moves forward.  That is, Test::Unit inherits from Miniunit in Ruby 1.9.<p>And Miniunit is far <i>far</i> simpler than RSpec.<p><i>Update: I'll consider rolling a screencast of how I TDD w/ Coulda as a basis for comparison.</i>",1292182559

They are contracts that occur between large financial institutions only. That is the 'secret'. The rest is just the equivalent of a high school tourist at the visitor's desk.</i><p><i>Eventually these contracts became standardized -- they referred to the same # of bushels, and they were backed by clearing firms and central clearing houses at the exchange</i><p>In the current state of affairs, the CDS market is not transparent and the participants who want to avoid transparency point to the custom nature of the contracts as a reason that they shouldn't be quoted electronically.  However, this situation is similar to what existed in equity/index options before the products started to be listed by exchanges: customized contracts were traded through brokers.  This sort of OTC trading still occurs, but it exists alongside a very large, very active market of exchange-traded options whose prices are very transparent and thus automatically force down the fees that can be charged in the OTC market because they provide publicly available pricing information on similar contracts.  If electronic exchanges were to create standardized contract terms for CDSs targeting some of the more heavily traded debt instruments (sovereign debt be a good target at this point for obvious reasons) and then list these contracts electronically, I suspect that this would bring a great deal of transparency to the pricing of these products due to the participation of firms like Citadel (which already has a large and profitable group making markets in electronically traded options).

That new operator allows us to bind return results if we want so. Overloading of ""."" allows us to implement various interesting operations - passing state, executing optional computations, executing non-deterministic computations, probabilistic computations, etc.<p>You incapsulate the meaning of computation inside object, so you can pass it to some evaluator without that evaluator knowing that you pass him non-deterministic computation instead of monte-carlo monad or vice-versa.",1292181482

Arrow composition is associative when it is defined.

Endofunctors map to the same category.<p>As each object in this category of endofunctors is a function we want to compose, we have to be given a way to do that.  This is what that the monoid here does -- it's a way to describe the allowed ways of combining natural transformations, including any systematic tweaks to be done during the combination.<p>(The classical definition of a monoid is just a set with an associative binary operation with an identity.)",1292181414

1997670,comment,1996857,1997646,0,0,tptacek,,,"What's ""large""? Even at thousands or tens of thousands, vector-style lists can be a win simply because they're faster to iterate through, they optimize locality, and they don't require pointer chasing.<p>At very large sizes, deletions from the interior can be painful, but at very large sizes you need to be customizing for performance (if that matters) anyways. Instead of deleting, for instance, you can invalidate, and then amortize the memcpy across many deletions; a straightforward time/space tradeoff.<p>The big problem I have with ""performant"" linked lists is that malloc is death to performance. The single biggest profiler payoffs I've ever gotten --- order of magnitude improvements --- have been from getting rid of calls to malloc. Yes, you can custom-alloc a linked list, but you're then getting to a place where lists and vectors are starting to converge on each other.<p>I think C programmers use linked lists instead of ""vectors"" because realloc resizing is scary, and because every CS student learns linked-lists in their first month of class.",1292180647

They exist as living breathing patches while I work on it. I'll amend and rebase them like crazy. After everything is tested and working I push the set up to the main repo so others can get at them.<p>The important thing is that you don't amend/rebase the main repo.

1997658,comment,1996793,1997180,0,0,visionik,,,"I'm Voxeo's CEO.<p>First - Danielle  I have the utmost respect for you and the marketing momentum you've been able to build around Twilio.  However, saying the ""quote is completely fabricated"" is itself is fabricated ;)    It's not a quote - it's a reference to something you said at ITExpo west this year.  Diggz wasn't there, but he (and I) were told by multiple people that you said it.<p>Voxeo is an extremely open and honest company.  I mean <i>extremely</i>.  I seriously doubt any single Voxeon would make this up, never-mind multiple Voxeons.  It's personally important to me to resolve this because I feel the honor and honesty of Voxeo is being challenged when you say it's ""completely fabricated"".  Are you claiming you said nothing at all like that?<p>Second, wether you now acknowledge saying it or not… to be frank, in my (and many other web-powered telephony industry vets) opinion it happens to be pretty darn true. Twilio has done a great job focusing on simplicity.  Twilio is many great things - but Twilio is not innovative.  I'm not trying to be a competitor or a jerk when I say that… I honestly have not seen a single technology innovation delivered by Twlio.   If you disagree, please suggest a few and so I and others who have been doing this for ten years can openly and fairly respond.<p>I'll give you some examples of what I mean - compared to Voxeo.  But I want to make it clear that this is not all about Voxeo.  You could also make comparisons to TelMe, Bevocal, Telera, Motorola and several others who were around ten years ago.  Voxeo is far from being the only company that invented and innovated the web telephony industry ten years ago:<p>1. Voxeo created and patented most of the technology and concepts Twilio uses today . in 2000, as shown here:<p><a href=""http://bit.ly/voxeo-patent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/voxeo-patent</a><p>2. Like Voxeo, Twilio makes it  easy for any web developer to create telephony applications, with a focus on lower cost and ease of use.  Voxeo has done that for ten years, as shown from the archived Voxeo developer web site on August 19, 2000:<p><a href=""http://bit.ly/voxeo-dev-2000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/voxeo-dev-2000</a><p>Sound like a familiar message?<p>3. Their are slides in Twilio's 2008-2009 investor presentation which are nearly an exact duplicate of Voxeo's 1999-2000 investor presentation.  To be clear, I don't know if Twilio's founders saw our presentation but the business plan concepts are so similar that slides were nearly exactly duplicated.   Down to the words and diagrams used.<p>4.  Twilio leveraged ""super angels"" to help build marketing momentum.  Although the term didn't exist back then, Voxeo's angel investors in 2000 included Eric Schmidt (now CEO of Google), Dale Fuller (then CEO of Borland), and David Orfao (then CEO of Allaire) ... they helped us build significant marketing momentum.<p>5. This is the first Voxeo example app in our docs, circa 2000:<p><callxml>
  <text>Hello World</text>
</callxml><p>This is the first Twilio example in your docs, ten years later:<p><Response>
	<Say>Hello Monkey</say>
</Response><p>All marketing BS and propaganda aside: Voxeo and Tropo.com are just way ahead of Twilio when it comes to innovation and features.  Everything Twilio has today Voxeo had ten years ago.  And Voxeo/Tropo have many features Twilio doesn't:  voice recognition, open SIP access, Skype integration, universal API for voice / SMS / IM / Twitter / etc, open source web client access (phono.com), direct Ruby/PHP/Phython/Groovy script language support (no need to force everything into XML and back to get things done)… there is no way Twilio could keep up match Voxeo / Tropo innovation and features, because Twilio is ten years behind from the get-go.  And Voxeo is investing more in new innovation and features today than ever.<p>I and the rest of Voxeo have always tipped our hats to Twilio when it comes to your marketing, modern web developer outreach, refocusing on simplicity, pricing models, etc.   Seriously, hats off.<p>However, the singular thing that bugs me (and other industry vets) about Twilio is how Twilio pretends they invented all these features and is a really innovative company.  I thought your comments and ""tip of the hat"" to Voxeo and Tropo on innovative features at ITExpo west was the first time Twilio has publicly been a bit honest about this.  I'm honestly disappointed to see you may be returning to Twilio the party line.  I hope that's not the case.<p>-Jonathan (CEO, Voxeo)",1292180445

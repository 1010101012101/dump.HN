I never receive chain mail or stupid jokes, because I don't deal with the type of idiots who send that kind of stuff. Those who <i>did</i> send me that sort of stuff were told in no uncertain terms that I'm not interested in it, and it stopped immediately (this doesn't mean I was nasty about it, though).<p>I almost choked laughing when he said he was ditching email for Twitter. Twitter is possibly the least efficient and reliable Internet-based communications medium. And I say this as someone whose profession is software to make greater sense of that medium. Was this piece meant to be satire? It just seems ridiculous to me.",1248860357

Perhaps to show that the color is consistent.<p>It helps in that it lets the user know that the password is wrong the instant they've finished typing it, which might be a nice touch if it takes a long time to verify a password. They still don't know where the mistake is though, so they have to retype the entire password.",1248859440

That's only 62 hopes for collision out of a space of 2176782336 (36^6 ... right?)<p>Think of it this way, if you capture the length of password, and the corresponding 6 hex characters, for every step of the password, that's quite a bit of information!<p>(a quick check confirms no first 6 character collisions in a-z)",1248858572

It just happens that YC companies have enough friendly folks (100+ fellow YC company founders, for example) looking at HN to where they pretty much always get enough votes.<p>I agree that commenting should be possible, though.  I'm not sure why it isn't.  If folks can't handle a civil discussion about the job posting, or if they can't be bothered to answer questions about the job, maybe a social news site is not the right place to post the ad.",1248858460

You should have a more complex timeline control or at least annotate the video with the time you're currently looking at. I need to know when the highlights are happening (when did my baby cry, is my baby crying at some regular interval, etc.)<p>2. There should be some visual cue showing the switch from one continuous segment to the next.

729727,comment,727751,728517,0,0,ovi256,,,"The rules of war have changed drastically in the course of history, in the sense that despised heresies become orthodoxy. Think about the pike, longbox, crossbox and musket - these are just a few examples that come to mind - they were despised as they allowed peasant footmen to take down aristocratic knights with impunity, and the last two, without much training. As such, they were regarded as heinous and unjust weapons that threatened the social order. Of course, pragmatism won, as it always does, and they became part of the traditional arsenal - and changed the social order. Who needs knights when they cannot win a battle ?<p>It could be that what we today call terrorism will become part of orthodox warfare in several generation. Military theorist already call it 4th generation warfare. Basicaly, it's just a strategy, very similar to guerilla, that allows a poor unequiped militia to keep in check what we traditionally perceive as the strongest best equipped army.",1248858314

729725,comment,729556,729619,0,0,jballanc,,,"I don't think the point is to see the two fields' colors match. Based on the run of similar posts to HN, this appears to be an attempt to solve the ""you shouldn't mask password fields"" problem. That is, once you've set your password, you'll have a three color combination that is memorable. That way, the next time you go to log in, you would (hopefully) notice if you had typed your password in wrong because the colors wouldn't be the familiar set of three. (i.e. You wouldn't be attempting to edit the password field, just clear it and re-enter.)",1248858195
729724,comment,729556,729693,0,0,chaosmachine,,,"Because you can see the color code at each step, it's easy to compare results very quickly, even by hand. Did I get letter 1 right? Ok, move on to letter two, try each key until the colors match the recording. Do this for each step. At most, you have to try about 64 key presses to crack each letter.<p>Also, because each step is only 1 character different, it's very unlikely that you will get collisions, even with a truncated md5 hash.",1248858174

729722,comment,729556,729667,0,0,Huppie,,,"The idea behind this program is probably not to show you when your passwords 'match' but to show you whether your password is correct.<p>E.g. If you see the colors of your password everytime you log in, you will probably learn that your password is correctly typed if you see the colours purple-green-olive.<p>Whenever you spell your password incorrect (and thus see  'blue-pink-black' for instance) you will notice it immediately, without pressing the 'login' button and being presented with a (not so nice) ""Invalid username/password"" screen.",1248858137

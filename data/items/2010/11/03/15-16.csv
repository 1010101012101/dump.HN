1865211,comment,1864591,1864900,0,0,ekidd,,,"I agree about Python's libraries. Normally, I'm a Ruby programmer, because I like Ruby's syntax and the Rack/Rails/Sinatra web stack.<p>But if I need to do scientific or linguistic programming, Python is absolutely amazing. SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib and NLTK support a rich and deep ecosystem. And it's vastly nicer programming environment than Matlab and Octave.<p>(Of course, GNU R is also pretty useful if you're doing pure statistics.)",1288799926

1865209,comment,1865091,1865091,0,0,bradleyjoyce,,,"The danger of NOT bringing on a technical co-founder is that you're then dealing with a different type of developer/tech person. This technical person is generally the type that gets (or could get) paid good money.<p>So as Travis mentions in his comment, if you don't have lots of cash on hand, you could run into problems. There is really no shortage of jobs available to developers, and chances are many jobs out there will pay much better than what you can afford to pay at your startup. Unless you find the perfect person who doesn't mind making less than he/she probably could and is still 100% dedicated, you'll probably have a high turnover rate.<p>In contrast, you can generally assume that a co-founder is going to give you 100% all the time as they theoretically have a lot of skin in the game.<p>In many startups, you probably don't <i>need</i> a technical co-founder, but you probably <i>should</i> have one anyway.",1288799888

If you're originating or are repackaging what may be questionable loans or derivatives, or are incurring excessive leverage, isn't that also a systemic risk?<p>It's a balance.<p>The folks that are severely upside-down (and staying that way) won't be consumers, they'll approach indentured status.

1865182,comment,1864710,1864710,0,0,joshklein,,,"I've found that cofounders can be both a blessing and a curse. I started something on my own that failed because I lacked the discipline to lock my brain in to work mode from 9am to 5pm. Working in my apartment - sometimes still in whatever I slept in - made me blur the lines between what was life and what was work. If you have a cofounder, at the very minimum you'll have to get dressed in the morning :) Hopefully, you'll also have someone keeping you accountable to deadlines, questioning what you did that day, and so on. Not in a manager style, but because they genuinely need to know what you've done every day.<p>But I've also started things with cofounders that didn't work out (I wouldn't say ""failed"" because they were more false starts than outright failures). You really do have to think of cofounding like a marriage, because you and your cofounder have to have the same set of goals. In 10 years, do you still want to be working side by side with this person? Could you take direction from them if you ultimately decide they should be the final say on something? Do you have the same exit strategy? Do you want to live in the same city as them? Do you want a small company or a big one? What kind of culture do you want your company to have? When are you both quitting your day jobs / consulting?<p>It may seem like discussing these things are premature when you're hacking in a garage, but the answers aren't nearly as important as the questions. You don't want to have a vision for selling a 50 person company to Google while your cofounder sees your startup as side income to his day job. And you definitely don't want to see your startup as an 80 hour/week gig while your cofounder sees it as a 10/hour week gig.<p>I follow Seth Godin's advice on partnership: 50/50 is a bad idea, period. Business requires decision-making, and someone should be the final say. If you wouldn't be okay deferring to your cofounder (even when he is wrong), maybe it's not the right cofounder. And ownership should be a factor determined by both time and money put in, not one or the other. Your agreement with your partner should stipulate how much time you'll be logging for the project, and ownership should be tied to actually ""showing up"".",1288799307

1865166,comment,1863678,1863926,0,0,dasht,,,"Re <i>the commerce clause covers [intra-state marijuana production, distribution, and use]</i>.<p>Sure.  As I recall the court's main reasoning was that as a fungible commodity, there is no such thing as purely ""intra-state pot"".   That's sensible.   For example, suppose that 19 had passed and everyone played by the rules:  lots and lots of marijuana were produced and consumed strictly within California.   That will nevertheless have enormous impact on inter-state price, production, and distribution patterns throughout the US for a substance in whose trade Congress asserts there is a strong public regulatory interest.<p>That decision did not overturn California's medical marijuana laws.  Those are still operative.  They are the authority by which, for example, dispensaries are owned and operated that do not violate any California laws.<p>From time to time the federal government does take action against the medical marijuana industry but, mostly they leave it alone.   One suspect that part of the reason for that is because the last time they cracked down heavily, they gave rise to medical marijuana laws like California's.  The original distribution co-ops / businesses were not authorized under state law.  They were in defiance of both state and federal law.   They largely arose out of the AIDS crisis after it was realized that marijuana had both palliative and therapeutic benefits for many patients (with no lawful substitute coming even close).   The feds tried hard to shut down those scoff-laws and parts of state law enforcement helped.   In response, first many other wholly unlawful medical distribution efforts sprung up (like mushrooms overnight).  Second, the state-level medical marijuana law went on the ballot and won soundly.<p>The feds toned it down rather a lot, after that.",1288799051

Because I don't have to pay my share of health care and infrastructure costs for the exhaust coming out of my car, I will tend to buy a bigger car than I would if the cost of that car included those externalized costs.<p>Gas and carbon taxes are mechanisms to internalize those negative externalities. They create an incentive for drivers to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles, which creates an incentive for automakers to manufacture more fuel-efficient vehicles. This is why European cars are on average much smaller and more fuel efficient than American cars, despite the fact that Europeans and North Americans drive roughly the same annual distance (17,000 miles and 18,000 miles, respectively.)<p>Another mechanism is the American CAFE system, which arguably does a worse job because it gives automakers an incentive to find loopholes in vehicle designations. We can thank CAFE for the preponderance of SUVs on the market.<p>On the other side of the coin, education has a positive externality because some of the benefits of an individual's education accue to society as a whole. Given straight market forces, individuals will on aggregate under-invest in their own education, and the economy as a whole will suffer from a lower mean worker productivity.<p>Every industrialized country quickly landed on universal public education because the aggregate benefits to productivity that come from a universally educated populate more than offset the higher cost to educate everyone.

We've had many conversations about these topics over the years.  I don't want to run on forever about this, but I'll drop a few relevant points I've learned over the years.<p>1) The comment I replied to above is pretty accurate, especially for younger children.  The parents and environment the child is in are the largest influence on their academic success.  If the culture of the area is not about education and success in learning, you've got a long uphill battle.<p>Honestly, you could pump all the money in the world into the worst high school in the country and it won't make a lick of difference if the students don't want to learn.  Upping the school's finances won't change the outcomes on the level people are looking for.  To get those kinds of results you need to change the culture and community around education.  However, if a school/community is simply lacking resources, then it could make a huge difference.<p>2) Sending your child to Pre-K DOES better prepare them for Kindergarten and school in general.  How much a difference one could truly make over another is not something I've ever actually asked my wife.  Dinner conversation for tonight :-).  I would also love to see the paper araneae had read and run that by her as well.<p>Education wise Pre-K will help your child with basics - colors, shapes, letters and numbers.  However, the biggest thing Pre-K will do is help your child learn to socialize and interact with people their own age in a classroom setting.  This doesn't sound like much, but it is actually a big deal.<p>3) Something not often thought about is WHEN to send your child to Kindergarten.  Many schools have policies like ""If your child will be 5 years old by December 31st"", which may give you a choice.  It is NOT always best to send your child to Kindergarten as soon as they are eligible to attend.  If your child is ready, by all means send them.  But if they're truly not ready, sending them is really not going to help them.",1288798563

1865102,comment,1864038,1864038,0,0,grellas,,,"For those interested in some of the legal technicalities, a few thoughts.<p>Timing is very important here.<p>In essence, Mr. Calacanis and TC had formed an LLC to run the TC50 conference, were therefore co-members (i.e., partners) and equal owners of that LLC, and had reached a point in 2009 where they had serious tensions between them concerning the venture. Whatever the true story, it appears that they entered into a formal settlement agreement, with global releases granted to one another, earlier this year by which the LLC was dissolved and the parties were allowed to go their separate ways without either of them being able to make legal claims against the other.<p>That in theory ends it all and should eliminate all future legal claims relating to the venture. Indeed, it is almost certain that the releases included the standard provision found in all California releases by which all parties would have agreed to release all claims, known <i>and unknown</i> and by which each party would have agreed and acknowledged to accept the risk of giving a full release even if later events revealed facts that might have materially altered that person's decision to grant the release in the first place.<p>So what happened?<p>AOL agrees to acquire TC, signs a definitive agreement to do so, and enters into an escrow/due diligence period preceding the closing during which TC and Mr. Arrington must warrant and represent, among other things, that the stock/assets being transferred are free of legal claims or liabilities that might affect AOL as buyer in the deal or, if not, that such claims are disclosed and accepted by the buyer.<p>If serious legal claims arise during this period, (1) the deal might be killed if the prospective acquirer decides that the existence of such claims materially impairs the value of what is being acquired, or (2) the selling parties must agree to indemnify the acquirer from all such claims and (almost invariably) an amount is reserved and held back at the closing to serve as a fund by which to satisfy such liabilities following the closing. While I have no idea about details, this might mean in, say, a $60M deal, that AOL might insist on a hold-back amount of as much as a third of the purchase price to cover this sort of risk (if the value of the TC50 conference is a <i>major</i> part of what it is acquiring in relation to the other TC assets, this percentage could be higher).<p>So what about the legal releases signed by Mr. Calacanis? Shouldn't this end the possibility of legal claims?<p>Yes and no. Yes, in that a court would find that all such claims <i>have</i> been released unless the settlement agreement can be rescinded on some lawfully cognizable ground. But no, in that any agreement can be set aside if it was entered into based upon fraudulent misrepresentations, mutual mistake and a few other grounds justifying rescission.<p>And that is what Mr. Calacanis is asserting here: that he would never have entered into the settlement had he known the material facts concerning the impending AOL acquisition, which he claims were not disclosed to him in connection with the settlement. He takes this a step further by asserting that Mr. Arrington and TC had fiduciary duties under laws pertaining to LLCs to disclose whatever material facts they knew about that impending acquisition. In other words, this was not a mere arms-length negotiation by which each party could go for maximum advantage by employing any sharp tactics available to it. When fiduciary duties apply, one party is deemed to repose trust in another and that other party has a duty not to abuse that trust. Put all this together and Mr. Calacanis is basically claiming that he was taken advantage of and misled into signing the settlement document, that he has a right to rescind it, and that it is therefore open season on his right to file a lawsuit over the whole mess.<p>I don't believe, in this context, that Mr. Arrington is publicizing this in order to get hits for his site or simply because he is a ""drama queen."" I believe he sees this sort of claim, timed in this way, as something that can have a large impact on his potential for closing the AOL deal or at least for closing it on favorable terms and, therefore, his tactic seems to be to attempt to portray it as a shakedown suit and to use that to gain leverage for his position.<p>Mr. Arrington is a fighter and I'm sure means it when he says he intends, in effect, to take this to the mat. He might be undercut in this effort, though, if AOL uses this as a reason to pull or modify its offer. This is where the true drama lies in this matter, in my view. I believe this puts Mr. Arrington under enormous pressure and probably explains why the claim is being asserted in this context. If it threatens to disrupt the deal, it might take a significant sum of money to make it go away.<p>By the way, the law firm asserting this claim on behalf of Mr. Calacanis is a first-class firm. If this does get filed, it will be seen as a legal threat that must be taken seriously by AOL if it is to go through with this deal.",1288798075

1865001,comment,1863278,1864357,0,0,mithaler,,,"""Write once, run anywhere"" is a phrase that historically has referred to multiple platforms by multiple vendors--that is, platforms other than ones maintained by a single company. That is, not just Macs and iOS. Even if they do unify their development interface for all of <i>their</i> platforms, that still will be far from WORA, since I don't see them coming up with an easy way to port their apps to Android or Windows or Ubuntu anytime soon.<p>While you didn't use that phrase yourself, the implication that it could be applied to Apple's offerings reeks of co-option to me--I think Gruber's right about that, since Apple appears to focus on providing the best experience for each individual device (and devices from other vendors aren't even an issue for them--why should they be?). That said, however, I think you're right in that it would certainly be sensible from their perspective to make it easier for developers of one of their platforms to pick up development for their other ones.",1288796581

Around where I lived you had to be at least 16 (maybe 14?) and there were restrictions on hours and the like (so you had enough time for school).<p>But then hiring a kid to mow your lawn was never anything anybody got riled up about, so I don't see why this would, either.  Around that age I fixed the computer of some family friends and they gave me one of theirs that they said was broken and wouldn't boot... turned out everything save the motherboard and power supply were good to go... cheapest upgrade I ever got.  (From my point of view, anyway).<p>Back in the 90's in high school stories abounded about this sort of thing - so and so got 100 bucks an hour for a day of work, etc.  That's absolutely the exception, though, regardless of how smart you are.",1288796438

The real reason is the reason that there is a lucrative industry for poetry contests: author's bias.  Everyone thinks their poetry is good.  Ask any startup founder to rate their idea, and they'll rank it in the top 10% of ideas.  Which means 90% of us are delusional.  (We'd have to be, to do what we do.)<p>A cofounder doesn't have to have equity or work on the project. They are the person you know who will be brutally honest with you.  They have to have the ability to say, ""This feature you love is stupid,"" and have you spend time deeply considering it.  They take ""you"" and your author's bias (as much as possible) out of the startup.<p>And that's key, because if it works for you is irrelevant.  It has to work for your market.  No one, ESPECIALLY YOU, can say if that will be so.  The best is where you can have the market itself give you feedback, but they are mostly incapable of enunciating what they truly want.  So you have to guess.  And when you do that, you need someone to help you winnow the chaff of what you like from the grain of what your market wants and needs.",1288796426

I think what he's really saying is that there is some <i>as-of-yet-unknown</i> physical process that is responsible for consciousness.  In order for us to discover what exactly that physical process is, however, we will probably (though not necessarily) have to completely revise our understanding of quantum mechanics.  For example, we might need a theory that successfully integrates QM with relativity.<p>Wikipedia has a decent article on hypercomputing(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation#Hypercomputer_proposals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation#Hypercomputer_...</a>) (i.e. computers that can do more than Turing Machines), which is essentially what Penrose believes is responsible for human intelligence.

If you sysadmin significant amounts of Python stuff then you would have already seen that benefit. It also allows you to control PYTHONPATH more elegantly than setting it in every script. This lets you write clean sensible imports rather than using fragile path tricks or wrestling with relative imports.<p>Your project dependencies are often not exactly the same as what the distribution gives. On one hand, distributions can be mind-bogglingly slow about releasing updates to python libraries. On the other hand, you may not want to force your project to use a new update of something because it may introduce bugs. It is pretty essential to have some lead time to port if your app is anything important. So you need control of the versions of your dependencies.<p>So if your project dependencies are not exactly the same as what the distribution uses, then you will need some kind of isolation mechanism in order to allow your project to work as a distribution package. You could do that, but you could also save time and just use virtualenv.<p>Creating platform-specific packages is nontrivial, also it is platform-specific. If I write a library for Python I only want to specify the packaging metadata/scripts once. I am certainly not interested in trying to get it accepted in repos for every distribution.",1340379750

Everyone can start with photography, you don't need the fancy equipment, and you can start with what you have.<p>2) The text starts people on the road to manual settings, i.e. learning the camera. The mechanics are not what photography as art is all about, that's composition and creativity. But, without practice and understanding the mechanics until they are second nature it's very hard to realize your composition and vision efficiently.<p>3) This is a starting point with some help to novices. If this helps someone take a slightly better vacation or family photograph, great. The text straight off the about page sums it up.<p>There are concerns:<p>1) ""Wow"" is what teaches?<p>There seem to be two major paths to learning from experts:<p>If they are dead there are books. Review: The Camera, The Negative, and The Print by Ansel Adams. Highly technical from a master who had a nervous breakdown after putting everything into his art to for a showing. Still not a great starting point for the novice. They are fantastic books for someone who's more advanced and ready to get into the minutia. This is contrary to the message that people should just go look at compositions and dive in.<p>Expert workshops: If wow is what teaches, than there are many expert photographers who conduct workshops. For the majority of novice to curious photographers my advice has always been to save the money and go out with a photo club or some photo friends. None of the people in these clubs are probably ""wow"" experts, but it's a bit like learning a sport by matching up with someone of equal skill rather than paying to be taught by a pro before you know what you are getting into.<p>2) Technical Details: These are common practice. The body of the site directs people to learn their own settings and exposure. I'd read more into the text and intent than the photo details.<p>3) Photography is art? Not to the majority of people who just want to take photos on vacation or of the family. The most common questions I get are: What camera to buy (well addressed here), what do those settings on my camera dial mean (addressed fairly well here), and how do I take better pictures (good starting points to think about composition).<p>4) Go look at good photos. Agree. Fair? No. The big investment for most people is time. From point #1, there are a lot of good books at the library... if you are of the willing.<p>As for disclaimer about skill, &c: People have paid for my photos as well. I have an art degree.

They'll get the job done in less than the 1/30 sec screen frame on the limited z80 knockoff in the original Dot Matrix Gameboy.  You'll get better than 99% prediction accuracy.  It takes about two hours to write the code, and you can train it with 20 or 30 examples unsupervised.  I know, because I've done it.<p>On the other hand, getting 90% prediction accuracy from movie rating results takes teams of professional researchers years of work.<p>.<p>""I can build a reasonable dataset for a prediction task from a set of 100M rows from a database that I maintain in my spare time""<p>And you won't get anywhere near the prediction accuracy I will with noses.  That's the key understanding here.<p>It's not enough to say ""you can do the job.""  If you want to say one is harder than the other, you actually have to compare the quality of the results.<p>There is no meaningful discussion of difficulty without discussion of success rates.<p>I mean I can detect noses on anything by returning 0 if you ignore accuracy.<p>.<p>""What's cool about this is that Google hasn't given the learning system a high level task.""<p>Yes it has.  Feature detection is a high level task.<p>.<p>""They basically say, figure out a lossy compression for these 10 million images.""<p>I have never heard a compelling explanation of the claim that locating a bounding box is a form of lossy compression.  It is my opinion that this is a piece of false wisdom that people believe because they've heard it often and have never really thought it over.<p>Typically, someone bumbles out phrases like ""information theory"" and then completely fails to show any form of the single important characteristic of lossy compression: reconstructibility.<p>Which, again, is wholly defined by error rate.<p>Which, again, is what you are casually ignoring while making the claim that finding bounding boxes is harder than predicting human preferences.<p>Which is false.<p>.<p>""they find that it can effectively generate human faces and cats.""<p>Filling in bounding boxes isn't generation.  It's just paint by number geometry.  This is roughly equivalent to using a point detector to find largest error against a mesh, then using that to select voronoi regions, then taking the color of that point and filling that region, then suggesting that that's also a form of compression, and that drawing the resulting dataset is generation.<p>And it <i>isn't</i>, because it isn't signal reductive.<p>Here, I made one for you, so you could see the difference.

They probably see Apple as a threat, but this move has nothing to do with Apple, since they build their own hardware and won't be affected by these signing key requirements.  Linux users make up a tiny percentage of desktop and laptop users, and many of those bought OEM machines with Windows pre-installed, meaning Microsoft got paid anyway.  The idea that Microsoft would undertake this kind of technical hurdle to stave off the coming hoards of Ubuntu users simply isn't realistic.<p>Secondly, pre-boot security vulnerabilities are very much real, and exceptionally difficult to detect in an already-booted operating system.  Here's an area where Microsoft <i>does</i> feel competitively threatened, since Apple has been able to win market share on the back of Microsoft's poor security record, so Microsoft has had to come up with some way to shore up this gaping hole in their anti-malware strategy.  Matthew Gerring of Red Hat, who's basically been leading the Linux efforts to figure out this UEFI stuff, readily admits that there are attacks already in the wild that UEFI addresses, and that no viable solutions other than signed OSes have been proposed to deal with them (see <a href=""http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/10971.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/10971.html</a> for a more thorough treatment).

The fact that Claude Shannon succeeded in training a chess system has virtually no impact on sallweachter's claim that many AI results were overstated.""<p>It wasn't meant to.  Sallweatcher's claim was silly.  Who cares if many things were overstated?  That has zero bearing on that valid work was, in fact, being done.<p>The purpose of that statement was to remind us that as early as the 1940s, machine learning was able to defeat its own creator at what remains today regarded as a highly intellectual pursuit.  My goal was to ignore the FUD of ""some people got it wrong"" as an attempt to suggest that there was nothing right.<p>Some people <i>always</i> get some of <i>everything</i> wrong.  His claim is tautological and disinteresting.  I was politely declining to shame him for it, but since you've presented me as having false goals, I now have no choice but to clarify.<p>It is generally inappropriate, for reasons like these, to chastize strangers over imagined motivations.  Frequently, you don't know strangers' motivations as well as you might imagine from a simple read of a few paragraphs.<p>.<p>""2. Certainly the press overstated them, which supports saalweachter's premise""<p>You are now repeating something I said to me back to me.  From that, you are deriving the false conclusion that because a journalist somewhere said something wrong, an important thing has been discovered.<p>What I'd like to point out is that the net result of observing that journalists made mistakes is still ""so what?""<p>""Even if the _implied_ claim was that _researchers_ overstated results""<p>It isn't.<p>""your argument does nothing to weaken this claim.""<p>You have not correctly identified what I was speaking to.  This is akin to telling someone discussing environmental damage that some farmer is talking about crop yield and the speaker hasn't weakened their claim.<p>Again: so what?  I never argued that there are journalists who got things wrong.  I'm the one who brought it up.<p>What does that have to do with my original discussion?<p>.<p>""Frito Lay solved a problem several orders of magnitude easier that of face recognition in natural images""<p>Discovering defects in potatoes moving at 45 miles an hour inside a water sluice from a single blurry image from a single angle in hard realtime using 1970s hardware is <i>not</i> several orders of magnitude easier than locating things on a face in slow time on modern hardware.<p>It's actually quite a bit more difficult even in fair conditions.  Potato defects are under the surface, and have to be located by subtle color variation.  It is not hard to find the characteristic shape and shadow of the nose.<p>With respect, sir, it's quite clear that this is not something you've done.  You're claiming that easy things are more difficult than hard things, and you're forgetting the 40 year technology gap inbetween in your rush to show that a 2012 project is more impressive than a 1973 project.<p>To be clear, Babbage's mechanical calculator is also more impressive than an algebra solving system made in prolog.  Why?  Because it's more work and it's more difficult.<p>Your claim of several orders of magnitude simpler suggests that you are inventing data for the sake of feeling correct in an argument, and that you do not actually have the experience to show correct guesses in this field.  That, combined with a tone suggesting that you feel it appropriate to rebuke strangers in public, suggests that I don't really want to much talk to you anymore.<p>.<p>""Frito Lay example contributes nothing to your goal of weakening saalweachter's claim that this is valuable research""<p>Again, you've misidentified my goal, and the way by which you've done that is to drop a critical piece of his actual claim.<p>I don't know why you feel that it's okay to guess at people's goals, then tell people how morally wrong your guesses are.  I really don't.<p>My actual goal was to point out the jarring unfamiliarity with the field that both he and you evidence:<p>""It's extremely valuable for someone to actually go and do a thing, now that we can, even if someone had the idea for the thing eons ago""<p>The thing I was focussing on was to show him that this thing that he's applauding someone for doing in 2012 for the first time now that it's practical, even though it isn't being used in industry, was actually outclassed by a much more difficult problem on much more limited hardware in realtime 40 years ago by a company that nobody would think of as a technology giant.<p>The goal was to display just how far out of touch saalweatcher was with the state of the industry.<p>Please don't speak to my goals anymore.  For someone who'd like to speak about condescention (when I think you actually mean arrogance,) for you to tell me what I meant and what I was getting at - incorrectly - then lambast me for it in a tone far more severe than that which you're criticizing is, I admit, difficult to swallow politely.<p>.<p>""I'm sure your father (respected AI researcher of the same name) would make them too""<p>Do not speak for, or involve, my recently deceased father in your attempt to be correct, sir.  <i>Especially</i> not while you're telling someone else they're being rude.<p>""I would a less condescending one that made better use of evidence than the argument you've made here.""<p>Unfortunately, though you suggest this, taking a brief look through your comment shows that this is not in fact correct.  You have been radically uglier than that which you are criticizing, involving personal attacks, false claims of other people's intent, false claims of other people's goals, and the repeat involvement of a recently deceased relative.<p>I would prefer not to hear from you again.

I've heard others make the claim that banks loan out more than they have in deposits, and I'm responding to that claim.<p>This is not true.  As far as I can tell, this misconception stems from the correct notion that banking (fractional reserve banking) expands the money supply.  This is sometimes extrapolated to ""banks create money"" and then to ""banks loan out more money than they have"".<p>Banks do not ""give out"" ""~ten times"" their deposits.  They give out (for sufficiently large banks) 90% of their deposits [1] in exchange for obligations to repay.  The money supply expansion that results from this (Alan deposits $100, bank loans $90 of Alan's money to Bob who gives it to Charlie who deposits it in a bank, which loans out $81 of Charlie's money to Dan, etc.) is the ten time expansion that you're probably alluding to; but the bank can't know that Charlie's money is money that it lent to Bob.<p>The banks are not doing anything wrong here; there's a larger argument about the societal benefits of banking, and whether banks should be restricted in how they give out their money, but starting with distorted facts makes these discussions very confusing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm</a>",1340377657

There are 10 steps to get top paid 25 overall in US:<p>1) Make great game and prepare great marketing\nYou need to spend on marketing as many time as you spend on development. Bad app can be pulled to top by great marketing, but when your campaign will end  app will be dramatically dropped down. This is what you see every day in top free charts with lot of farms that makes rocket jump because of great marketing and falling to nowhere another day. So you must make great game.<p>2) Test your gameplay\nBut game must be great not just for you  because what you make is already great, otherwise you wouldn't do it, right? Every developer just love his game because it's like a child and sometimes you just not strict enough to your child. So test your game a lot  give it to your friends or even strangers. And don't ask anything  just look at their reactions and make conclusions about mistakes and advances.<p>3) Catch all bugs\nTest game on different devices and firmwares. The worst thing you can have is a great game with bad review, because of some bug. Don't release unfinished product. And have some support page, like getsatisfaction, so people will tell your about bugs not by App Store reviews, but on your support page.<p>And if you miss some bug  use expedited review. You can use it once a year, but it really helpful  about one day and update with fixes will be on App Store.<p>4) Don't make lite version\nIt's boring and player will have to pass through same levels in full version if he buy it. But you need free version for players who would like to try your game! So make something special  we call it Gemibears Mini. It's free prequel for Gemibears, it have completely different planets, levels and additional game mode  all these features are original and don't appear in paid version. Same way was made Trainyard Express and Hambo Begins. Different content for free is a best way to show your game and have positive response from players, because you don't cut anything from the game  you add something new to it.<p>Remember that your paid and free (not light!) versions  are separate products. Free will help you with promotion of paid, but you need to promote free somehow. So plan your marketing for both free and paid versions.<p>5) Cross promo and ad\nMake cross promo with other cool games. Gemibears have promo screens, buttons and so on in different games from our friends. This is not about money, more about your connections. Send email with cross-promo proposition to games you like, or even travel to another city for meeting with their developers. Because support from other great games will give you lot of downloads.<p>Connect all your previous games by some cross-promo module. You can make in house solution or use something like chartboost  but 3rd party solutions are not flexible at all.<p>Use paid ad  but use it carefully. Buy iOS ad ONLY. No web, no magazines, videos or anything else outside device. You can buy installs for free app in chartboost or buy ad spot directly in Backflip, EA or Zynga games using Burstly, but be careful planning your budget.<p>6) Make something that will generate new users from inside of your game\nWe have twitter community in Gemibears and Facebook connect in Gemibears Mini. Both give an option to attract new players, because community is always great idea and attract new people, and by connecting your friends to the game you can gain additional content.<p>7) Make all marketing efforts in one day\nDon't spread it for month or even week. We release Gemibears few days before all marketing and have no downloads at all. But after using all marketing that we prepare in just 3 days  top 25 occupied!<p>8) Icon, screenshots and trailer\nYou need a genius icon. Most of people make decision about buying or not your game just by looking at it icon. We make about 26 different variants of Gemibears icon before we considered it good enough. Great, to be honest.<p>Other really important part  App Store screenshots. Actually, they aren't just screenshots  they are banners. Most of people don't read description, so take each screen and tell about key game features on it. Be brief and persuasive. Not ""unique gameplay"", but ""match-2""  this is truly unique!<p>Official trailer. If you don't make it  some youtube teen will record video from shaking hands and all people will see the game as it looks at this video.<p>9) After release buzz\nDon't underestimate any additional free buzz that you can make. Register your game in Facebook App Center, if you have any fb functionality. Submit your icon (it's must be great, do you remember?) to iOS icon gallery sites. Make TouchArcade forum post  in upcoming section before release, in discussions right after or even make some contest!<p>Don't expect Apple feature on App Store. You can't control featuring process, so concentrate on making great game and marketing.<p>Don't expect Press will admire your game for first time, even if you have a great game. Press and blogger like success stories, so you will have press after success, not before it.<p>But you have to write to everyone. Make not just text letter, but some custom html template or at least image banner for header of the letter. This way we have TUAW game of the week for our previous The Screetch game. They ignore our text letter with promocode, so we make nice-looking picture, send a latter again and  it works!<p>10) Write useful post on Hacker News!",1340377438

4147018,comment,4145012,4145692,2,0,riordan,,,"This is exactly it! And it's fundamentally a transformative concept for ""cultural memory organizations"" as libraries, archives and museums often (somewhat pretentiously) call themselves.<p>Of course, this is a concept hackers have understood for decades. It's why Jason Scott collects text files, scans old arcade manuals, and why Archive Team rips the entirety of Yahoo! Video, Geocities, and poetry communities just before they're about to be shut down. And they then ensure sure they're available to all who ask. For free. Forever. On Bittorrent.<p>Unfortunately, the old stuff isn't as easy to copy. It's locked up in big places like my office, The New York Public Library. But cultural memory organizations, even if they don't realize it, are WHERE ITS AT when it comes to transforming all that documentation of human endeavor and into some of the most powerful, useful, and amazing materials going forward.<p>While we used to treat our super rare special collections as cherished things never to see the light of day except by a couple of curators, interns and a few handpicked researchers and only then in climate controlled bunkers. On rare occasions, the public sees them only as part of an exhibition, on display once every few years for a few hours a day. While this is great for the insuring the longevity of the object, it's not so great for exposing the public to tangible history. Now we're opening up the rarest of materials, which are often the freest in terms of restrictions (due to their age), making them public, and making them richer with use. Suddenly using the rare stuff makes it better with every use. Way better.<p>These kinds of places are among the best beachheads in the fight for Free Culture. Some of the smartest thinkers about the copyright fight are now leading the Harvard Libraries from the inside. John Palfry's the head of the Harvard Law Library (for a few more days), David Weinberger is leading the team that's writing the code behind the Digital Public Library of America, and Jonathan (JZ) Zittrain, who cofounded the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, is about to become the Law Library's Vice-Dean.<p>Basically what I'm saying is that there are vast swaths of human knowledge and endeavor at crazy risk of being left behind. This isn't bit rot. This is real rot. Or sometimes we ""digitize"" something by just taking a picture of it. But then it's just a picture, not a page from an atlas with grounding in a a real time and place, and it gets lost in a photo gallery and a metadata system. And it's just sitting there, waiting for someone to come along and breathe life back into it, to make it something more powerful than it ever was on paper. To be fully indexed, crosslinked, talking to all the other information available, related, and relevant. That's eminently possible, it's just not being done at sufficient scale.<p>We need hackers in every position in these organizations. Here at the New York Public Library, we're working on that. We have one curator who hacks on Node and Backbone because it means he can better disseminate and preserve musical theatre (also because it's really fun). We have one curator who's digitizing copyright-free maps of New York City and is using it to basically create historical Google Maps all the way back to when Europeans first showed up on North American shores - or as someone just called it ""Building guidebooks for time travelers"" [1] (I'm particularly proud of that one). And now I'm going to move into the realm of shameless self-promotion and a plea. My team looks for cool datasets throughout the library and builds projects on top to transform them into structured data by any means necessary (often it's often crowdsourcing) then builds APIs so anyone can get to that data. We also build animated gif creators [2].<p>Basically what I'm saying is that those rare books, those archives, those old photographs need hackers to keep these materials around. To keep them relevant. To inspire countless others to create great works. And here's the point. We need so many more people helping us.<p>We need you. Not just at NYPL, but everywhere across this industry. Because how cool is it to hack on the sum total of human knowledge and make it available to all who ask?

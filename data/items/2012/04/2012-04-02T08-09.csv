Freedom and usability aren't orthogonal concepts like some make them out to be. I fundamentally disagree with the idea that we need to lock everything down to make it ""usable"".<p>Also, Freedom of software (and hardware) ultimately has greater implications on society as a whole, which is why I raised the issue. It's not merely a feature, a pro or con, it's something which at least people like here on HN should be greatly concerned about. Computers play an incredibly important role today, and will only become even more important in the future.

It was a genuinely terrible phase of my life, and caused a lot of personal re-evaluation for me.<p>I actually adored high school. There were 330 people in my graduating class. I graduated third, only a sliver of GPA away from salutatorian. There were 6 National Merit Finalists in my class (including myself) and one of the things that always drove me to excel in high school was the sense of competition with my <i>very</i> intelligent peers, along with the support of some amazing teachers who actually cared about us and would be actively disappointed when one of us didn't live up to our potential. Many of my advanced classes in high school were <i>very</i> small. We had 12 people in our AP Chem class.<p>Then I got to college and I was just another number. I lost my peer support group and any meaningful feedback on my work from my instructors and with it, my motivation.<p>Until that point in my life, I'd always had my sense of self and identity tangled up with academic achievement. I was a ""smart kid"". Doing poorly in college didn't just feel like a failure to get a particular grade, it made me feel like <i>I</i> was a failure as a person.<p>It took me years to get over that. In fact, I'm not 100% sure I <i>am</i> completely over it. But at least I don't let it consume me anymore.<p>You're more than your grades, you're more than college. There is so. much. more. to any single person than a single facet. If you think you'd do better in a smaller school, try to transfer before it's too late. Or if you decide that college isn't for you, don't beat yourself up about it. You can still well, especially in technical fields where skill is more important than a sheet of paper.<p>And get help for the depression, if you aren't already. I spent about a year on Effexor (and Ambien for the crippling insomnia that piggybacked onto my depression - it was terrible, I used to get auditory hallucinations of alarms clocks and phones ringing in the distance) and it truly made the difference.

It's a subtle feeling and you probably won't feel it if your are used to white sugar. Before I related the downs to the heavy lunch I had before, that I haven't slept well or that the work is just so boring, etc.<p>Another observations regarding ""white sugar could be drug"": Look how many shelves with sweets you find a grocery store and compare the amount to other foods and with alcohol (where you usually find similar quantities).",1333355881

(There's also a ""less sure about"" column which contains things like ""we sing for the hell of it"" and ""our hearts are distinctly on the left."")<p>The tiptoeing one comes from when I was trying to discuss evolution with some intelligent design enthusiasts in the US (shudder). So the point they were making was, you can't possibly say that we look similar to dogs. And with my laptop I started pulling up skeletal diagrams of us and dogs, and showing that pretty much the entire logical structure of dogs' skeletons is identical to that of humans' skeletons, from shoulderblades to legs, if you think of them as standing on their tiptoes. It also points out a clear parallel between our arms, which have the same logical structure as our legs, and common ancestry suggests an elegant solution -- once, there was no difference between arms and legs, so of course they had the same structure -- natural selection just stole the recipe for one leg and used it four times.<p>Anyway, it's very interesting to see that these observations about our nudity and non-tiptoe bipedal walk come from such a simple, easily-expressible underlying story.

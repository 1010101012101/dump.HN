So you start with the near-term goal of paying your rent and food, and a longer term goal of doing much better.  (The whole idea of planning to build a $1B company makes little sense to me.  Rather, first build a $100k company, then turn that into a $1M one, then $10M, etc.)<p>Admittedly, this sort of strategy doesn't work for all kinds of startups, in which case you might start a related small business, and use it as a base to launch startups.",1243288747

What happens when computers can write software or manage a company better than humans can?  What place would we have in such a world?  How would the economy work?<p>And what about war?  Assuming we don't get ""self-aware"" machines, it seems like humans would derive their power based on the capabilities of the computers and robots they control.  Then of course, natural resources also come into play; you can't build machines without materials and you can't run them without power.  In the end, I think it's much more likely that the war will be humans with robots versus  (other) humans with robots.",1243288637

625938,comment,625722,625722,0,0,DocSavage,,,"James Surowiecki, in his book ""The Wisdom of Crowds"", addresses some of this.  Of the three conditions he says are necessary for the crowd to be wise, he says the following which applies to the holiday meal planning:<p>""Diversity and independence are important because the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise.  An intelligent group, especially when confronted with cognition problems, does not ask its member to modify their positions in order to let the group reach a decision everyone can be happy with.  Instead, it figures out how to use mechanisms -- like market prices, or intelligent voting systems -- to aggregate and produce collective judgements...""<p>The use of crowd wisdom to select a holiday meal is doomed as soon as the author says ""eventually you realize there's only way to please everyone.""  That's not the way you use crowd wisdom.  The better way is to give them some # of tokens and let them spend the tokens on possible meals.  The final selections won't please everyone, but more people will be happy at the party.  If there's limited meal choices and everyone has veto power as per the article, the solution will quickly go to null with the number of voters.",1243288390

It's still the same language because you could get the same results - it's just a lot more typing.<p>It seems to be a similar thing happening with CSS frameworks, although there's less inefficiency to remove than with my exaggerated example.<p>Adding variables and arithmetic to the mix also has the potential to make things more maintainable if used correctly - if you're setting the same number multiple times or setting a number as the result of a calculation an expert CSS coder will have to remember to update everything (and/or) redo the calcuations every time they want to make a change.<p>It's a medium sized win but I'm willing to take a look.",1243287931

It usually isn't until someone discovers something potentially disruptive (or the people who have money latch onto new buzz words) that the flocking changes.  I can agree that each field has problems of interest.  I'm a computer scientist but I have no interest in trying to solve P=NP.

625917,story,,,3,2,zacharypinter,"Ask HN: Free Software in the Cloud?",,"I've had an idea in the back of my mind for a while and would love to hear some feedback. It seems like the free software movement has yet to address the move to cloud computing. I love the reliability and availability of web services like remember the milk and dropbox, but constantly find myself wanting to add small features here and there. Of course, that's the limitation of SaaS. You don't have the source and you can't make improvements.<p>So, what would it take to make a scalable, cloud environment for open source software? I assume the three key ingredients would be:<p>* Distributed File System (all data public, private data gets encrypted)<p>* Sandboxed Map Reduce<p>* Public keys as account identifiers<p>Any additional tools should be able to be built on top of those three. The idea would be that people could contribute CPU and Storage resources to signed versions of applications they like. Since all the data is public, somebody else could fork an application and still have access to all its files (and the files of other users). If a fork gains enough popularity, then people will dedicate their CPU/Storage to it instead.<p>Any thoughts? Are there any loopholes or security issues I'm missing that would make this unfeasible?",1243287329

625905,comment,625746,625834,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Very true.  I'd guess that 90% of pg's audience for <i>A Plan for Spam</i> (which led on to the popularity of his later essays) came from Slashdot.  It's where I first heard about pg, and Trevor and probably rtm for that matter.  Lisp has been discussed for years on Slashdot.<p>Also, folks here may not realize it, but Slashdot still wields a mighty traffic hammer; it is not some irrelevant also-ran that redditors/diggers/HN readers might think.  At least one of our websites has appeared on TechCrunch, Reddit, Hacker News, and Digg in some context (never a major story, but usually getting some votes and some discussion, and occasionally making the front page)...one time my co-founder mentioned something we were working on <i>in a comment</i> on Slashdot.  It was the highest traffic day we've ever had (to this day, and our traffic has increased steadily since launch, so every few weeks we have a new peak; but always less than Slashdot day).  Our traffic is pretty good, in general, for the kind of business we run.  But Slashdot is the motherlode.  I speak of it fondly, still.<p>Anyway, for a site with a user base that large and diverse, Slashdot isn't as entirely idiotic as it could be.  It's certainly no worse than Digg, and only slightly worse than reddit.  And 10+ years ago when it was the size of Hacker News, it was roughly equally interesting and smart, though its focus was somewhat different (less business, more Open Source).  The signal to noise is too low for me to spend much time there, but it's silly to imagine that Hacker News would remain as good as it is with a user count in the millions, like slashdot.",1243286921
625904,comment,625722,625836,0,0,stratomorph,,,"I speculate that the type of structure is the major factor causing the quality of social interaction to diverge. Wikipedia is people collaborating to make something, and only incidentally communicating with each other, on talk pages and user pages and so forth. Slashdot (and all its ilk, including Reddit and HN) is primarily people communicating <i>with</i> each other on comment pages. (I disregard story voting here because they don't have the same process, but also because voting is a relatively trivial input for a user, whereas writing a thoughtful comment/profane flame takes significantly more effort.)<p>In a nutshell, Wikipedia's product is not <i>communication between users</i>, so the Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory (<a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19/</a>) finds less purchase.

Most software is simple enough to work well in a browser and you can't beat being able to use the same app on any computer without ever installing or upgrading.  This advantage seems to disappear on mobile phones though.  I carry my phone everywhere I go, so portability isn't really an issue.  Most phone platforms provide an easy way to install and keep your apps up-to-date, so that concern fades away too.  Most importantly though, I see native mobile apps having a much better user experience than web apps (regardless of whether or not the webapp was written for a mobile platform).  On the desktop, I can keep a web app loaded and running all day.  That seems a lot harder to do on a phone.<p>Palm is unveiling their webapp based phone soon.

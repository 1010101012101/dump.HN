It just gets tricky to implement without screwing with the primary scheduler pool.<p>I&#x27;ve written many NIFs for Erlang that call out to high-performance C routines when &quot;number crunching&quot; is most important.  I&#x27;ve also done it to side-step memory allocator churn for implementing binary protocols that support zero-copy semantics like Capnp by using the NIF as a kind of escape hatch where I can fiddle bits in a buffer directly.<p>In fact, somewhat lazily since it&#x27;s low priority, I&#x27;m trying to create a decent Rust wrapper for the NIF interface so that I can attempt to get more compile time safety out of the dangerous stuff I do outside BEAM&#x27;s safety net.<p>Other than being dangerous, since a segfault will bring down the whole VM, the other big issue is these calls block the scheduler (basically breaking the VM&#x27;s preemptive abilities and creating the same limitations Akka on the JVM has when you block all the threads in an ActorSystem).  However, now that R18 has dirty-scheduler support it&#x27;s much easier to avoid this problem by quarantining that stuff on threads that don&#x27;t muck with executing normal bytecode.",1451685402

10823663,comment,10822995,10823474,0,0,TheCoreh,,,"> a proprietary software project must eventually act against your interests because you are not in control of it<p>Being open source doesn&#x27;t mean that won&#x27;t happen. A lot of open source projects have acted against their users&#x27; best interests. A good example is Firefox with the whole &quot;Pocket integration&quot; controversy. Another example is Wikipedia, with its editorial policies that drove away editors. You <i>can</i> fork Firefox, and you can host your own Wikipedia mirror with exactly the same software setup, and in fact a lot of people have done so, but mantaining your own fork/mirror of a project on this scale is a lot of work. Unless you have unlimited free time (you don&#x27;t) open source doesn&#x27;t inherently remedy the issue that other people will do things that you do not agree with, and that may cause problems to you.<p>Platform choice is ultimately an economical decision. Github has significant incentives not to &quot;go rogue&quot;, i.e. they don&#x27;t want to shoot themselves in the foot. They currently provide very significant value to the community, and are in a very comfortable position, but that could change really fast if they take the Source forge route.<p>While the more code that gets open sourced the merrier, I personally don&#x27;t believe open sourcing Github would, at this point, bring a lot into the table, especially since gitlab is so fully featured already. Their secret sauce isn&#x27;t really the software, but the service they provide.",1451685289

Both appeared to fail due to the cyclotron, neither part was available to buy. So instead I got my parent&#x27;s old microwave from the 1980s.

It works fairly well in practice. It ends up looking like a `__future__`-import pragma that has interpreter lifetime scope rather than file scope.<p>`__future__` imports cannot be undone within the same file -- after all, they&#x27;re pragmas scoped at the file level, not actual imports -- and it would make sense for these backported features to behave similarly, though at the scope of the interpreter&#x27;s lifetime. That might not do what you want.<p>As you&#x27;d expect, the most superficial of Python 3&#x27;s new features (syntax changes, `raise from`, &c.) would be easiest to backport. The bulk of the difficulty would be in merging those changes into Python 2.7. Making the result hot-loadable would be just as easy as in `dutc-rwatch`, though being able to toggle features on-and-off independently would require combinatoric effort with the naïve approach. You&#x27;d need to do something smarter.<p>All in all, it&#x27;s wholly possible to do what you want, and you probably have the skill to even do it yourself.<p>I&#x27;d happily do the work myself, but only for lots of money. Unfortunately, the burden of both certifying the resulting interpreter as correct and of maintaining this fork would be large.<p>And then when you&#x27;re on-boarding some fresh new post-grad you&#x27;ve just hired into your research group:<p>&quot;Oh, we use Python 2.8 here. That&#x27;s what we call Python 2.7 with an unsupported collection of modules that mutate the currently running interpreter to backport features from Python 3.

My conclusion is that it doesn&#x27;t mean much of anything in terms of actual software development, and only matters in terms of P.R. and marketing.<p>Some of these replies are pivoting to talk instead about the fate of abandoned projects on SourceForge.  That&#x27;s a great discussion, but is a DIFFERENT discussion.  The parent comment talked about consequences that reduce engagement with active projects.  By definition that becomes irrelevant when the projects are inactive and long abandoned.<p>Anyway, nothing in this lengthy post is really all that compelling.  Developers didn&#x27;t shift from SourceForge to GitHub because SourceForce became shady.  The timeline was the other way around, SourceForce became shady because everyone left.  That initial shift happened because tastes changed, people legitimately preferred what GitHub was doing interface-wise... and once a critical mass has moved, it pulls everyone else who wants the social advantages of being in the popular destination.<p>If GitHub turned evil (or worse yet... &quot;uncool&quot;), then I just don&#x27;t see the migration pain you&#x27;re talking about.  Pushing a git repo to a new remote is trivial.  Learning a new issue tracker ticket system takes about 10 minutes (they all work basically the same), and SOMEONE will write a script to automatically migrate GitHub issues to the new thing.  Wiki content?  Sheesh... it&#x27;s just Markdown.<p>The biggest risk is that you&#x27;ve used your GitHub URL as your exclusive web presence, rather than spending $10/yr on a real domain name.  But if you&#x27;ve made that mistake, then you&#x27;ll probably make the same mistake with ANY solution that isn&#x27;t self-hosted.<p>By all means, host your own personal open source projects wherever you like.  But telling everyone else to stop doing what everyone else is doing, on the basis of some Richard Stallman-esque principles that don&#x27;t hold water, seems like a waste of time and energy.",1451684757

Python would have less competition on being an easy to use language, batteries included, with good enough performance (SMP wasn&#x27;t as popular then). Java had a bad perception -- too bloated, enterprise-y, Javascript on the server wasn&#x27;t happening much.  Go wasn&#x27;t there. Scala not as popular.  In that context, people would eventually have switched to Python 3 even if it took some pain (security maintenance, some newer features etc), because GIL wasn&#x27;t a big deal and it sure wasn&#x27;t going to be Perl again (maybe Ruby for webdev?).<p>The situation is more difficult today -- Python has more serious competition. Once a team has found the time/money/excitement to switch to Python 3, it is a high chance they&#x27;ll start looking and evaluating other languages/platforms/libraries (and I speak as a person who loves Python and used it professionally for 12+ years).  It is now competing with Go, Elixir, Javascript, Scala, Julia, Clojure, even Rust, Java, and C++14.

Using a hosted service like GitHub as a remote for your git repo doesn&#x27;t &quot;negate&quot; the distributed aspect, any more than parking your car somewhere negates its ability to drive around.<p>I can use GitHub as a remote and take advantage of the social and UX aspects they offer, and if GitHub vanishes (or has downtime), I can continue utilizing my git repo with all the distributed features it had before. I can (and have) continue to work while GitHub is down, I can export any of the additional data (issues, wiki, etc) that GitHub offers and store them just like I store all my backups, etc.<p>Centralized hosting solutions can offer value, even to distributed tools.<p>Where GitHub ends up conflicting with distributed workflows is when build pipelines or other systems are set up to rely on GitHub (Go dependencies, I&#x27;m looking at you). In cases like this, the user is making a choice to pin that piece of their infrastructure to a centralized service. And that&#x27;s not always a bad call! If the value provided outweighs the harm done when the centralized service goes down or has other issues, it can be a good choice. It&#x27;s up to the person designing their infrastructure to balance the risks and benefits, as with anything else.<p>Specifically speaking to GitHub&#x27;s lack of incentive to invest in extending distributed git features: that seems counter to actual events. They recently worked to develop their large file storage, and rather than release a closed source / centralized system, they released an open source extension that ties in with core git (<a href=""https://git-lfs.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://git-lfs.github.com/</a>)",1451684132

I&#x27;m not going to talk about the community edition of Gitlab, since Github Enterprise is a separate topic and frankly I think most individual developers couldn&#x27;t be bothered to download, run, and maintain their own Gitlab instance (as evidenced by the fact that Github.com is so damn popular).<p>1. Gitlab themselves admit that Gitlab.com is bad[1]. Making a cloud-based software development platform is hard, and Github has some of the best engineers working on scaling the service. Gitlab doesn&#x27;t have nearly as many resources.<p>2. The community is thin[2]. Almost all of the largest projects on Gitlab.com are Gitlab. Gitlab CE is maintained by only a handful of people. Go through the list of top contributors on Gitlab.com and you&#x27;ll find that they have almost zero &quot;personal projects&quot; hosted there. If the developers of the service don&#x27;t even use it, why should I?<p>3. The UX of Gitlab is honestly quite poor. At best, it&#x27;s a clone of Github&#x27;s UI. At worst, it has way too much scrolling thanks to inconveniently placed whitespace, poor performance, a confusing information architecture, and oodles of low-contrast text. I personally find getting around Gitlab to be tiring and confusing. Here&#x27;s an easy example: from the Contributors tab of a project [3], how can I see more about a contributor? You just can&#x27;t. There&#x27;s lots of little papercuts like this scattered across Gitlab. Not to say Github is without papercuts, but it certainly has far fewer.<p>[1] <a href=""https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://gitlab.com/explore"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitlab.com/explore</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/graphs/master"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/graphs/master</a>",1451683222

Unlike most of the languages talked about on HN, the BEAM makes no bones about what considerations it&#x27;s made, and what sorts of problems it is and is not intended for.<p>While there are a few just general warts to be found, they tend to either be obviously surface level things (&quot;I don&#x27;t like ~this~ bit of syntax&quot;), or so deep you are unlikely to hit them (the issue with large binaries being stored off heap, and reference counted, and references only being collected when an individual process heap collects, leading to certain edge cases where large binaries remain uncollected even when they should be collected, leading to a memory leak that can eventually OOM you, for instance. See <a href=""https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/11/7/logplex-down-the-rabbit-hole"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/11/7/logplex-down-the-...</a> ).<p>But aside from that, basically everything is intentionally considered and sensible from a &quot;fault tolerance&quot; perspective. And that makes it hard to criticize the language/platform; for a general purpose language, anything that doesn&#x27;t jibe with your use case you can complain about. For a biased language like this, intending to solve a specific kind of problem, any decisions the language makes that don&#x27;t conform to your problem domain are issues with you trying to use it for your problem domain, rather than issues with the language.<p>Example: The BEAM isn&#x27;t fast at pure number crunching; rather than complaining about how slow it is, anyone looking at a problem that requires a lot of number crunching will, rightfully, say &quot;This is not the tool for the job&quot;.<p>So for those problems where it -is- the right tool for the job, the cohesion between tool and problem is excellent, because the language doesn&#x27;t try to be all things to all people.",1451683158

10823511,comment,10821679,10823116,0,0,im_down_w_otp,,,"I write both Erlang and Elixir.  One negative thing I&#x27;ll say about Elixir is that it sometimes feels like a Ruby-shaped DSL obfuscating the Erlang I would otherwise be writing more clearly.<p>I don&#x27;t like optional syntax.  Like dropping parens for argument lists, etc.  Elixir adapted this quality of having varieties of optional syntax from Ruby-land, and I think it makes things harder to read and writing is sometimes ambiguous.  So for my part I just avoid it and write out the explicit form every time.<p>I also think the weird variable rebinding doesn&#x27;t really solve an interesting problem, but also ends up sometimes making things more confusing when reading code in projects written by people who leverage it all the time.  I happen to like explicitly naming reused constructs with different names each time they&#x27;re bound. 1) it makes is explicit which version of a thing you&#x27;re working with (e.g. Time1, Time2, etc.), and 2) it makes writing the code a lot more similar to how one might sketch up a more formal construction (e.g. T, T&#x27;, etc.).  So here again I just write out the explicit form like I would have in Erlang.  To me the very existence of the &quot;pin operator&quot; is kind of an indicator that rebinding was a weird design choice to solve what seems like a non-problem.<p>Lastly there&#x27;s a fair bit of boilerplate in Erlang when using the OTP patterns, and in Elixir there are often metaprogramming constructs that attempt to provide some sugar or some shortcuts to mitigate that, but I find this is really hard for newcomers when trying to understand how something like say Supervisors work, because in Erlang everything that&#x27;s going on is explicit and well documented, but in Elixir the connections and relationships between concepts, callbacks, etc. isn&#x27;t quite as clearly spelled out and the docs don&#x27;t really help much (in fact they make it more confusing because at the same time they introduce Supervisors they also introduce GenServers, and give the false impression those concepts are tightly coupled).  I often point learners at the Erlang docs and give some instruction around OTP concepts in Erlang so that they have an easier time mapping them in Elixir.<p>That said there are a ton of things I really like about Elixir.  Starting with Mix.  Oh my god how I love Mix.  Having the language come bundled with an easy to use build, dependency, and release management tool is unbelievably nice.  I also really like the fact that a lot of effort went into organizing the standard library so it&#x27;s coherent.  For the most part things are pretty discoverable.  Functions that take state or context to modify pretty much always have it passed in in the same location in the argument list.  Whereas in Erlang it&#x27;s different depending on which module you&#x27;re in, and sometimes not even consistent inside that same module.  Also it&#x27;s nearly impossible to know where to go look for a particular piece of functionality in Erlang due to the way the organization of the standard library accreted over many many years.<p>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed adding Elixir to my stable of tools, and there are a couple projects at work will definitely be made significantly richer by the fact that they&#x27;re built in Elixir.",1451683089

He told me that if I want a decent forecast, I need to find out which government agency provides forecasts for a nation&#x27;s airlines. They will be the only civilian organization investing in getting the good forecasters.

We&#x27;re going to use Python to build a modern infrastructure for interacting with both consumers (via the web, mobile apps and smart-meters) and the industry (eg trading on the wholesale market, managing the billing life cycle).<p>To start with, we&#x27;ll be using Django and the Django-REST-framework for the consumer-facing sites, and employing Pandas and Numpy for some of the heavier data processing required. We use AWS heavily, employing most of the Hashicorp toolset (Vagrant, Packer, Consul, Terraform) and are planning to use Lambda to build event-driven functionality.<p>This is a great opportunity for several reasons:<p>* We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The UK energy market is very complicated and process-heavy - there&#x27;s an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right.<p>* We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we&#x27;ll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.<p>* There&#x27;s a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular.  The energy landscape is changing as we move to more disaggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.<p>* You&#x27;ll be working for a company that is genuinely helping to make the world a better place. We&#x27;ll be helping move people onto using greener technology and consuming energy from renewable sources.

Or SourceForge, or whatever the next popular thing might be.<p>For one, <i>I do</i>, and for two - why was sourceforge changing their business model to shady predation a problem? It was not because they were a website on the Internet - there are millions of URLs of clickjackers or other malware you could visit and harm your computer with, but you rarely see them.<p>The problem was that a ton of open source software had <i>mindshare</i> on sourceforge, that remains a problem <i>to this day</i>, and it took years to move <i>most</i> projects away from that hostile environment. Plenty of very useful free software remains hosted on sourceforge, and there are plenty of <i>reasons</i> - developer inertia, community loss from switching, legacy systems in place that aren&#x27;t portable, lack of interest in learning new tools, and many more - but the <i>reasons</i> matter less than the result - that we have thousands of projects staying on a website known to infect people with malware.<p>Most of that software remains as portable as anything on gitub - often even moreso, because sourceforge offered many fewer developement ecosystem features than github now does - but has no switched for <i>whatever</i> reason. We can go after the individual projects and heckle them until we can get them off sourceforge, but that is a ton of effort and mental energy we could have better used making good software.<p>Which is fundamentally why the decision between github and <i>any</i> open source alternative is so important. This is not a question of benevolence, or even time - Github, Inc is a private company hosting a proprietary website that has 11 million accounts and 29 million source repositories today. <i>Any</i> action they take can destroy either trust in the platform (why exactly do you trust a proprietary web service, again?) or its usability for whatever purpose you depend on it for, and since it is proprietary there is no recourse. You just have to repeat the sourceforge hell and somehow move off of it as a hosting platform - except you might have drunk the koolaid, and now have your issues, releases, build service, wiki, and website all bound to the github platform. If moving just the source control, release hosting, and a forum from Sourceforge was bad, trying to get away from Github would be much, much worse.<p>But all these migrating projects should <i>know better</i>. They were already betrayed once by proprietary software they depended on, but are taking familiarity and mindshare over the security to never have that happen again. At least with gitlab, when Gitlab Inc jumps the shark, you - or <i>anyone else</i> could spin up the lifeboat to easily and seamlessly save your community with. And that collateral alone means Gitlab Inc. is <i>much</i> less likely to betray you for profit.<p>It is not a question of if. Unless Github open sources itself, and that is impossibly unlikely considering how huge their code base must be now and how many football fields of lawyers they would need to prune their internal code, a proprietary software project <i>must</i> eventually act against your interests because you are not in control of it, no matter the intention of the creator.<p>If you are going to have to bite the transition bullet, you might as well only have to do it once. Considering the parity between github and gitlab, I have never met anyone who would literally refuse to contribute to a project because its not on github, you just miss casual eyes that are more common there because the platform has captured more userbase.<p>But that userbase control is so dangerous, and we should all care enough to try to correct for it when we can, if it doesn&#x27;t negatively impact us much. And honestly, a project like Python would have been perfect for it - they won&#x27;t see a dearth of developer interest just because they are using the second most popular source control web service out there.",1451682721

Or maybe I&#x27;m not retired, but have 3 kids in the local school district and having to uproot my family because I can&#x27;t afford my home is extremely disruptive.<p>One of the points in buying a home, rather than renting, is to guarantee that stability.<p>I agree that there are problems with prop 13, but fairness is a two sided coin. It is certainly not fair for my home (which I own) to suddenly become unaffordable due to external circumstances. Likewise it&#x27;s not fair for a neighbor to pay double for roughly the same consumption of public services.<p>I don&#x27;t know the solution. Possibly decoupling property tax from home values might be the answer. It certainly isn&#x27;t a very good tracker for public good consumption.",1451682524

One of the main reasons people believe they are so powerful is due to translation, rotation, and scale invariance of the learned networks: the top layer coefficients are very similar (in terms of squared norm) regardless of the target object&#x27;s location, size, and rotation in the image.<p>This paper basically shows that the structure of deep convolutional networks (specifically: shared convolutional kernels at each layer, subsampling / pooling across layers) are the main reason behind this behavior.  Furthermore, the relative invariance increases with the depth (number of stacked convolutional layers).<p>They show this by first showing that a wide variety of convolutional kernels and pooling behaviors provide said invariance (the tools they use are from the world of graduate level calculus + analysis: wavelets and frames); they also show stability with regards to nonlinear deformation (even if the original image is swirled around / deformed a bit before shifting, rotating, scaling; the coefficients still don&#x27;t change much).  That&#x27;s one major result of this paper.<p>Then they show that the invariance property is not tied to the kernels per se: you don&#x27;t need the intermediate convolutions to be a wavelet, fourier transform, or whatever.  This is important because neural networks don&#x27;t use a fixed convolutional kernel - they learn one on the fly from training data.  The theorem in this paper that shows the invariance is somewhat independent of the specific coefficients of the kernel and therefore general convolutional neural networks share these same properties.<p>That said, the learned kernels of the lowest layers of convolutional neural networks do tend to look like wavelets / curvelets / shearlets / etc, while the higher convolutional layers tend to look like higher level features.  So neural networks&#x27; kernels are already close enough to the theoretical family of possible convolutional functions studied in this paper for the theorems to more or less apply.<p>Since it&#x27;s impossible to prove that a Conv NN trained empirically on a dataset of natural images actually exactly learns wavelets or anything possible to study theoretically, it&#x27;s nice to have a paper that says it&#x27;s not the kernels themselves that are super important, but that the structure of pretty much any deep convolutional NN, is the important part.<p>Finally, the paper extends a neat way to think about convolutional neural networks (by extendint Mallat&#x27;s initial work): that the layers represent functions which are invariant to group operations like rotation and translation, and stable with respect to deformation.  This means you can study these types of neural networks using group theory (abstract algebra); an area of math where it&#x27;s easy to gather insight about how things work and develop new algorithms that you can translate back to the real world.",1451682056

It must run basically every python 2.7 (or 2.6) program without changes. It should backport as many features as possible. The meaning of &quot;str&quot; and string literals (bytes or unicode) should be configurable on a per-file basis. It should have a print statement. Finally, it should be able to use all the binary modules from 2.7 (maybe after recompilation).<p>Currently at our work (in physics research), I have the feeling that people are giving up on Python. It&#x27;s not worth the trouble to port to python 3 - especially because we can&#x27;t switch all code at once; we&#x27;d have to support both versions for years. C++ which is also heavily used here is getting much nicer, with proper tooling it is even more pleasant to work in (code completion etc). We are mostly using Python for a) configuration files and b) quick and dirty scripts. For these cases, Python 2.7 will be good enough forever. If someone does something more complex, they&#x27;d probably use Python 3 - but they treat it like it&#x27;s a completely different language rather than a new version of Python 2.",1451682038

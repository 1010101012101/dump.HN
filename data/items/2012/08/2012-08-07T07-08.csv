His newsstand has been closed ever since, an aching reminder. A car hit an 11-year-old girl from her church a few weeks ago. The girl now watches praise dances from a pew, her leg encased in a cast.

In his most recent book Clay Christensen describes what makes you love your job better than anything else I've read. He distinguishes between motivators and hygiene factors (mainly citing Frederick Herzberg's research): ""Motivation factors include challenging work, recognition, responsibility, and personal growth. Motivation is much less about external prodding or stimulation, and much more about whats inside of you and inside of your work."" On the other hand he lists hygiene factors: ""status, compensation, job security, work conditions, company policies, and supervisory practices."" (from <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1836982/clayton-christensen-how-find-work-you-love"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/1836982/clayton-christensen-how-f...</a> and his book). You can pile up perks as much as you want; they just serve as hygiene factors. As long as your motivators are not met, a high retention quote is wishful thinking. HR departments at bigger startups (and bigger perks) know that all too well.<p>At the end of the day you don't work for the big colorful slide at your office, or Whiskey Fridays, or your favorite 80's arcade video game. Cynically speaking, these are just there to make your long work days a bit sweeter.<p>So what's left for startups to retain their top employees? It's figuring out what truly motivates them. This takes a lot of hard work, empathy, and will. It's a long term investment. As such it might not pay off in the short term, but it might well give you in return the high retention rate you're looking for.",1344325196

Mind you this was no social engineering attack - as far as I can tell the service reps involved (both Amazon and Apple) sticked to company procedures. If the process had been automated (i.e. no humans involved), the end result would have been the same.<p>I was thinking alone the following lines:<p>* Upon account registration you submit one or (preferably) more e-mail address of close friends/relatives to the service provider you're registering with<p>* if you've lost your password, you click the password reset button. Then two things happen: a) a password recovery link is sent to you and b) a n-digit pin code is sent to your friend(s) e-mail addresses.<p>* the names and/or e-mail addresses of said friend(s) are never shown, so it will not be entirely clear to an attacker who to target next (based on social network data he may take a guess though).<p>* You click the password recovery link and get a form that asks you to enter the n-digit pin.<p>* You call one of your friends to retrieve the pin code and enter it (optionally different pins could be sent to different friends to aid forensics in case something goes wrong after all).<p>This scenario basically shifts the burden of verifying that you are actually you from some random service rep to one of your close friends. There's still a chance that (s)he gets social engineered, but quite probably (s)he has a far higher chance of getting it right than some service rep - besides plain voice recognition it's very hard to convincingly fake the minute details that make up a multi-year real life relationship of any kind.

Your ISP e-mail provider (or gmail etc) sit there and wait for e-mail to be sent to them making it less processing intensive (push based systems).<p>There are some techniques such as imap IDLE to make this a bit more efficient but 1. not every e-mail provider supports that and 2. for ex. with gmail idle caps at about 35K connections per box.<p>You could also have for ex. gmail forward all email to a custom address but average users generally found this very confusing and couldn't get this going.<p>We calculated that it cost us about <i>2 euros</i> per month to support a free user providing a 'good' user experience.

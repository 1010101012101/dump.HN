Learning these does not teach us anything new nor make us better at our craft. These are simply useless tediums.<p>Another pet peeve is Template Inheritance.

From what he told us they don&#x27;t live in the same area any more but make it a point to meet up once a month.<p>After work I made a detour to get some stuff, and I happened to walk past the cafe where said colleague was hanging out with his friends. I was walking opposite the street but could see them through the glass windows laughing and having a good time, and in that moment I felt a visceral pang of emptiness / loneliness.<p>I am unable to forge a deep level of friendship with people that I meet in Meetup groups - simply because they already have their own cliques and social circle. Even if they do form a new one, it will never be as close-knit as the ones they have formed throughout highschool simply by virtue of the fact that one has been ongoing for a longer time.<p>If you can visualize it like a spider web, where you are in the centre and the &#x27;webs&#x27; that branch out are your friends -  the more friends you make and the stronger connections you form (usually happens throughout high school and college) - the larger your spider web grows exponentially. The closer a person is to you, the nearer he is to the &#x27;centre&#x27; of the web. Think of it this way - the larger the spider web people have, the harder it is for someone to get as close to the centre of the net as possible. At this stage of life - almost everyone already has established their &#x27;spider web&#x27;.<p>I know this because I actually do have such a clique since highschool. We still maintain contact over Whatsapp but since I am the only one that is overseas, I am unable to meet up with them frequently. And within that circle I do have a couple of close friends who I message on a weekly basis, and who I would call lifelong buddies. No way will the new friends I make over volunteering/hobbies/meetup groups ever become closer to me than these lifelong buddies I have - so how how can I expect the same for them?",1447835848

10586640,comment,10584639,10586260,0,0,YeGoblynQueenne,,,"Your tone sucks but your question is valid, and I&#x27;m personally interested in the history of capitalising variables, so I&#x27;ll answer your question.<p>In short, it all goes back to Prolog, the language used to write the (first versions of) Erlang&#x27;s first compiler. Prolog has bequeathed quite a bit of its syntax to Erlang and also chunks of its semantics, for instance the pattern matching (although arguably that may be a trait inherited from its functional lineage instead, or maybe Prolog borrowed it from LISP, or possibly it was just convergent evolution).<p>In any case, in Prolog any term that begins with a capital letter or the underscore, &#x27;_&#x27;, is a variable. A single underscore is a &quot;don&#x27;t-care&quot; variable. There is a very good reason to syntactically distinguish variables from non-variables like this. Note that I said &quot;any term&quot; earlier, rather than &quot;any identifier&quot;. In Prolog, variables are never stand-alone identifiers[1], instead they are arguments of predicates. That&#x27;s because Prolog variables represent logic variables, rather than computer science variables. By &quot;logic&quot; here I mean mathematical logic, as one may find in textbooks. In this sense, logic variables are not meant as references to memory locations (though in Prolog it&#x27;s very convenient to see them as such, at times). Instead, they represent unbound terms, terms whose value we do not know until a certain point in our calculation, or indeed computation. Once the value of a variable is known, it stays the same until the end of computation (it&#x27;s immutable) and we speak of the variable as being &quot;ground&quot; or &quot;bound to the value&quot;.<p>Now, first-order logic predicates, and therefore Prolog predicates, are written in clausal form as:<p>F(t1, t2, ... tn)<p>Where &quot;F&quot; is a ground term and t1,...,tn any number of terms, each of which is either a ground term or a variable (ie, unbound). So we need a way to tell ground terms from variables. In textbooks, the convention is to denote variables with lowercase letters and ground terms in uppercase. In Prolog it&#x27;s the other way around, probably because of some concern over overuse of the Shift key in old-style keyboards.<p>The alternative of course would be some kind of annotation of the varible, with an additional term. For example, we could use the functors &quot;ground&quot; and &quot;variable&quot;. This would make for hairy syntax though; look at our example predicate from above:<p>ground f(variable t1, variable t2, ground t3)<p>That syntax would just make it harder to see what&#x27;s going on. Instead:<p>f(T1, T2, t3)<p>- makes it perfectly clear that T1, T2 are variables and t3 is a ground term. [Edit: where &quot;predicates&quot;, in Prolog, read &quot;functions&quot; for Erlang. In Erlang also there are no stand-along variables declared, or referenced, outside of functions so the same hairy syntax would have to be adopted to distinguish them].<p>... And that is how Erlang got its uppercased variables.<p>________________________<p><i>[1] So in Prolog, as in first-order logic, one cannot declare variables separate from predicates. You don&#x27;t start a program by laying out a bunch of variables and their types etc. Variables live between parentheses, as parts of terms, never anywhere else.<p>Well OK, you can also do this:<p><pre><code>  f(T1, T2, t3):-\n    t3(T1)\n    ,T2\n    ... \n</code></pre>\nBut that&#x27;s a story for another time :P</i>",1447835756

There are two answers, which I will simplify. One, the Big Bang threw everything all over the place and now masses are moving so as to reach the state of minimum energy. Two, there are 3 other forces in the universe which can cause masses to move. For example you can use electromagnetic forces during the combustion of rocket fuel to send a satellite in space.

A while ago this was still purely conjecture, but Maldacena showed that this correspondence was true (under certain conditions) for an AdS space with a conformal field theory on its boundary. As far as I know this is now pretty well established, most of the discussion seems to be on how much it can be generalized.<p>From my (limited) understanding it seems that (in AdS/CFT) entangled particles tend to correspond to strings traversing from one part of the boundary, through the bulk, to another part of the boundary, the space the string travels through then forms a tube like object. This gives a link between entanglement and geometry, since these tubes exist if and only if the two points on the boundary are connected.<p>I think it isn&#x27;t disputed that this happens for AdS/CFT, but whether something similar is true for our universe is debatable. If however it turns out that the holographic principle does hold in general then that would imply that our universe somehow corresponds to a 2+1 dimensional field theory, where entanglement of this field theory is responsible for the fact that our space-time is connected.",1447834989

Python/Ruby/Lua/Elixir/Julia would be great for this. This also produces a better result: I can&#x27;t tell you how maddening it is to not have basic language constructs in, say, Django templates, because the template designer decided to write a whole second much crappier language inside the language you&#x27;re using.

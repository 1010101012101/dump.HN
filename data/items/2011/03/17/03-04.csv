The necessary goal? Zero carbon emissions globally by 2050.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_wave_reactor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_wave_reactor</a>\nTWRs differ from other kinds of fast-neutron and breeder reactors in their ability to, once started, reach a state whereafter they can achieve very high fuel utilization while using no enriched uranium and no reprocessing, instead burning fuel made from depleted uranium, natural uranium, thorium, spent fuel removed from light water reactors, or some combination of these materials. The name refers to the design characteristic that fission does not happen in the entire TWR core, but takes place in a fairly localized zone that advances through the core over time.",1300334259

Start off by building a web app using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), and HTML/CSS, and set up your own server on Slicehost or the like. Also learn Javascript and jQuery.<p>3. Choose a good text editor and familiarize yourself with it, it's a long-term investment.<p>4. Focus on getting good with one or two languages, and keep building stuff and learning from others.<p>That's just for web stuff though.

The method that AirBnB employs is referred to as Third Party Payment Aggregation. They're processing payment on behalf of the hosts.<p>Venturing into this territory for an established company would likely cause a lot of pain. They might need to establish a relationship with a different processor and/or bank who would support the model.

Refused all (except for one). I think for a living & write books not interviews. This is what I have to say.)\nThe Japanese Nuclear Commission had the following goals set in 2003: "" The mean value of acute fatality risk by radiation exposure resultant from an accident of a nuclear installation to individuals of the public, who live in the vicinity of the site boundary of the nuclear installation, should not exceed the probability of about 1x10^6 per year (that is , at least 1 per million years)"".<p>That policy was designed only 8 years ago. Their one in a million-year accident occurred about 8 year later. We are clearly in the Fourth Quadrant there.<p>I spent the last two decades explaining (mostly to finance imbeciles, but also to anyone who would listen to me) why we should not talk about small probabilities in any domain. Science cannot deal with them. It is irresponsible to talk about small probabilities and make people rely on them, except for natural systems that have been standing for 3 billion years (not manmade ones for which the probabilities are derived theoretically, such as the nuclear field for which the effective track record is only 60 years).<p>1) Small probabilities tend to be incomputable; the smaller the probability, the less computable. (Forget the junk about ""Knightian"" uncertainty, all small probabilities are incomputable). (See TBS, 2nd Ed., or Douady and Taleb, Statistical undecidability, 2011.)<p>2) Model error causes the underestimation of small probabilities & their contribution (on balance, because of convexity effects). Any model error, just as any undertainty about flying time causes the expected arrival to be delayed (you rarely land 4 hours early, more often 4 hours late on a transatlantic flight, so ""unforeseen"" disturbances tend to delay you). See my argument about second order effects with my paper. [INTUITION: uncertainty about the model used for calculation of random effects causes a second layer of randomness, causing small probabilities to rise on balance].<p>3) The problem is more acute in Extremistan, particularly the manmade part. The probabilities are undestimated but the consequences are much, much more underestimated.<p>4) As I wrote, because of globalization, the costs of natural catastrophes are increasing in a nonlinear way.<p>5) Casanova problem (survivorship bias in probability): If you compute the frequency of a rare event and your survival depends on such event not taking place (such as nuclear events), then you underestimated that probability. See the revised note 93 on αδηλων.<p>6) Semi-technical Example: to illustrates the point (how models are Procrustean beds):\n[see http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/notebook.htm]<p>Take for example the binomial distribution with B[N, p] probability of success (avoidance of failure), with N=50. When p moves from 96% to 99% the probability quadruples. So small imprecision around the probability of success (error in its computation, uncertainty about how we computed the probability) leads to enormous ranges in the total result. This shows that there is no such thing as ""measurable risk"" in the tails, no matter what model we use.<p>---------<p>Nassim's full blog/notebook here:\nhttp://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/notebook.htm",1300332072

Reasons:<p>Technically, it <i>should</i> be possible to filter out uranium. Thorium, too. Both are heavy enough, it should be possible to centrifuge them out of just about any mixture, unless the compounds they're in are too tightly bound with lighter molecules by intermolecular forces. Even then, I would expect them to find their way ""down"", even if they had to drag some of the nonradioactive portion with them.<p>The amount of energy you get out of the coal or the uranium is a function of not only the amount of energy in each, but their relative quantity, as well. If there's not enough uranium present to extract a significant portion, I'd have to wonder if there's really enough to put out as much energy as the coal's total output.<p>Taking it a little further, if there isn't enough to extract, is there really enough to pose a significant health risk? We're exposed to a certain amount of background radiation on a daily basis already. How much more does the uranium in coal add to this? Again, I'm tempted to doubt it's significant, if there's not enough to be extracted.<p>So, do we have reliable numbers on this?",1300331103

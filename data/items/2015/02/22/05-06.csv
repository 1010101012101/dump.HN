Nearly everyone makes a 1911 these days, and the cheaper models are most certainly not the sort you&#x27;d use in competitive shooting like a Les Baer.

Both shoot well and are probably far more accurate than me. :) I tend to like the Glock a <i>little</i> more because of its simplicity and ease of taking it apart.

My counter-argument is that because asm.js is being pushed as a distribution platform for &quot;desktop&quot; apps, and web services are so rarely open source, software freedom stands to take a hit.<p>The main reason free software saw such adoption was that it was very high quality software available for free.  Most people aren&#x27;t even aware of the philosophy and history behind it, nor would they base their decision on what software to use on that philosophy and history.<p>Web services aren&#x27;t covered by free software licenses, but they generally have no cost, are sandboxed, and you don&#x27;t have to install them (even though you&#x27;re actually &quot;installing&quot; them a lot, just in the background).  For almost all users, that&#x27;s a huge win, but for free software, that&#x27;s a huge loss.<p>asm.js enabled many more classes of software to run in this environment, and I think that&#x27;s a big looming negative for software freedom.  I love Mozilla and I think what they do is amazing on almost every level.  But the web is more than just a browser and JavaScript.  There&#x27;s 65k ports and dozens (hundreds?) of protocols.

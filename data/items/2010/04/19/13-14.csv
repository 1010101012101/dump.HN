1276663,comment,1274911,1276251,0,0,glhaynes,,,"Your response didn't make it clear to me where my recollection is wrong or in which ways I'm confused.<p>The Apple II was doing very well at the time the IBM PC was introduced, but no one system dominated in any sense. It was clear early on, though, that IBM's entry into the market was going to be a milestone for the industry and that IBM was going to dominate in the business market, almost regardless of product quality because of the ""IBM"" name and marketing channels. Apple floundered with responses including the Apple III and the Lisa. Jobs clearly felt that IBM domination was nearly inevitable: look at the 1984 Mac commercial.<p>I don't recall the ""partners of IBM (which had a license to clone IBM PCs)"": if there were any, they were very few and insignificant. Compaq was the first successful unauthorized PC clone and was promptly sued by IBM, who also became distracted for the rest of the decade trying to re-proprietarize PC architecture with the PS/2. IBM was seeing tremendous success with their PCs before clones became popular, though clones and the race toward low-priced commodity certainly helped the PC architecture become further dominant and ensured its continued dominance until the present day.<p>I mostly agree with your statements about OS/2 vs. Windows 3.0/95/NT, and your point about Microsoft's partnerships leading to more Windows drivers is a good one. IBM wasn't in a good position to do this, since they were only interested in selling the whole box. This was certainly a factor in Windows' ascendancy and something that IBM didn't begin to catch onto until much too late.<p>I don't foresee users becoming locked in to phones in anywhere near the same way as they did with PCs: even most users who have many apps on their phones and use them for some sophisticated tasks wouldn't have much of a problem jumping to a different mobile OS. This is due to several factors, including the types of tasks that people do with their phones (generally simpler tasks with less integration between multiple apps) and the ascendancy of both open/compatible document formats and web services. On the hardware side, people are already used to throwing out their cases/chargers/adapters when upgrading from last year's model to this year's model by the same manufacturer, so there's little lock-in there, though Apple at least has some capability for lock-in through so much of their (very popular) stuff being standardized around their proprietary Dock Connector. I'd say Apple's recent moves show that they get that mobile lock-in doesn't work in the same way and isn't as much of a factor as it is in the PC business: they're not trying to use their current market position to lock users in nearly as much as they're attempting to lock <i>developers</i> in.",1271684692

He's talking about actually having a chance at getting code in, rather than rejected outright.<p>The entire process is daunting.  Here is the problem in a nutshell (or a comment):<p>1. I have an idea for something.  I'd like to code it.  First, I want to find if someone is working on it.<p>2. I try to search the mailing list, but don't find anything.  Some things slightly cover it, but most don't.<p>3. I'd ask in the mailing list, but frankly, I don't want to sound stupid.  Besides, talk is cheap, code matters, right?  Besides, what I want to code up is small.<p>4. So I just code it up.  I hack it up, and get it to work.  Yay!  It works for me!<p>5. So, now I need to send it back in.  Hrm, who do I send it to?  Lots of emails.  Do I submit a bug report and then a patch? I can try that.<p>5a. Hey look!  No one responds to my patch after weeks of sitting there!\n5b. Hey look! Someone responded! Yay!  They explain briefly that this is the wrong place for the patch.\n5c. Hey look! Someone responded! Yay!  They ask a question regarding something you have no idea about that possibly relates to your patch and Sparc processors.  WTF!?<p>Here's the thing: open source projects generally make it difficult to contribute easily.  This is a good thing.  It forces people to truly commit to getting their code live.  However, it is also a deterrent.  Couple this with piss-poor documentation, and you have a serious problem.  I'd love to develop user side apps for Gnome, but honestly, I just don't have the desire to wade through the mountains of misinformation and back and forth.  I want to code, not spend time Google searching every 2 minutes.<p>This is something MS does very well, and why it gets the love of developers.  They present an easy way to get up and developing on the MS platform, on any MS platform, with little to no effort.  Developers spend their time developing, not installing half a dozen packages and then finding out that they don't have the exact version number of the package they need to have.<p>Yes, I've contributed to OS projects.  I've contributed fixes to problems I've had.  Heck, I remember doing some stuff with X to get multihead monitor support in my WM of choice at the time, and sending it in for a fix (not sure what came of it).<p>A lot of rambling here.  I guess it comes down to developers scratching an itch.  And since developers who are developing already have an environment setup, there is no need to scratch that itch anymore.<p>I should point out that most of my OS/Linux days were pre 2005.  Mostly 99-2004, and so things probably have changed since then.  I just remember the confusion, the lack of direction, etc.  Maybe it was my inexperience at the time.<p>Edit:\nA good example is: <a href=""http://live.gnome.org/JoinGnome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://live.gnome.org/JoinGnome</a>  This is where I was directed on joining Gnome development (from here: <a href=""http://library.gnome.org/devel/gnome-devel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.gnome.org/devel/gnome-devel</a>).

1276609,comment,1276042,1276076,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"<i>I've never heard of an example of a city that died from high real estate prices. Do you know of any?</i><p>New York in the '70s. I wouldn't call this ""death"" since the city came back, but I wouldn't want to repeat that debacle.<p>It's not high real estate prices per se that kills a city <i>per se</i>, but real estate <i>volatility</i>. When real estate prices are high, repairs aren't made because there's no need to-- apartments sell themselves. When they're low and vacancy rates are high, repairs aren't made because there is no point.<p>High real estate prices and rents also impoverish a city; they draw money out of it, since most of the ownership is outside of it (cf. New York, where absentee assholes own most of the rental property). Some people in the city benefit, but the net effect is negative, especially since the young and talented are invariably on the butt-end of property prices/rents. During the boom, this isn't a problem, but after the boom ends, prices and rents remain high (""sticky"" is the economic term) and this drains the city like a vampire.<p>Ten years later, due to disrepair, poverty, and exodus of talent, you have a shell of a city. Then the crime starts, and the city falls into an arrangement like New York in the 1970s nightmare.<p>What's difficult, if not impossible, to predict is when this transition will take place. It's likely to hit New York, but I have no idea if that will happen in 2011 or 2030. The tricky problem with bubbles (and New York real estate is still in a bubble, despite the semi-collapse of the national property bubble) is that it's very difficult to predict when they pop, although inevitable that they will.",1271683118

It's true that they seem to be miraculously making more money than their official salaries, but that's <i>also</i> true in many countries, including Europe and the US. Some are shadier than others; it ranges from outright dirty stuff (taking bribes, insider trading) to gray-area stuff (accepting free trips and gifts) to semi-legit stuff (giving paid speeches and doing private-sector consulting on the side). US Senators get paid $174,000/year, for example, yet their average net worth is $14 million. Some of that is wealth accumulated before entering office, but a typical Senator also makes quite a bit more than their official salary when in office.

Imagine for example that you have a 1 minute launch window, and a slower than expected fuel pump means that it takes 5 minutes longer to top off the fuel tanks.  Well, you just missed your entire launch.  Stand everyone down, and put the spacecraft back into standby before trying again tomorrow.  If you have a planned hold, you simply reduce the planned hold time, and you can still hit the launch window.<p>The hold is also used as a sync point between all of the different activities that have to be completed at certain points in the launch preparation.  For example, at the t-4 hold for the Curiousity launch, they needed to pass the go/no-go from the entire team.  If one team had been running late up till that point it wasn't a problem, the other processes just entered the hold earlier.  Once the last hold has been cleared, all of the remaining processes have to stay synchronised.",1322322931

3279979,comment,3279612,3279612,2,0,doosra,,,"I understand your frustration. I too graduated from such a private college with a CS degree in 2003. Here is why I think you should complete your degree:<p>- You are being forced to study the core areas in CS. You will probably soon specialize in your work/research, so learn the core areas when you still have the time.<p>- Unless you have already created exceptional products, regular employers will not consider you unless you have a degree; these employers are a good fallback if nothing else works. The degree is a baseline to avoid being filtered out.<p>- If you want to go to graduate school to do research, either now or in the future, an undergraduate degree is essential.<p>- Getting a B.Tech isn't hard. Put in the minimum effort if you want, but it isn't tough to pass, nor is it a time sink.<p>Yes, the teaching can be unimaginative, professors may strictly adhere to a syllabus, and the exams test rote memorization, but one can still be stimulated in this environment. I would unceasingly ask questions to fully understand algorithms being taught in class, often challenging professors (and finding holes in the thought process). The database class helped me understand normalization and other ideas of good DB design (and their rationale), which I used for my web projects. A queuing theory class helped me understand performance of a system I later built.<p>There is no doubt you need to go beyond just getting the degree. Do you have fantastic ideas for products? Maybe a bit of freelancing will help? I created websites for clients abroad while doing my undergrad (just get a low bandwidth internet connection from a mobile company for this). I interned with companies/organizations during the summer. For my final year project I wrote a simd+cluster version of a program that I ran on all the computers in the department's lab (and tripped the ups!). I also realized the importance of a degree and tried to stay close to the top of my graduating class.<p>The challenge is to stay motivated to get the degree, while also finding an outlet for your passion. Both can be done. Freelance during the semester working nights and weekends; work with a company during the summer; participate in CS competitions in your region; find a local conference in an area of interest and publish a paper (this isn't hard!). It's really up to you to get motivated and rise above the rest.<p>While I sometimes wish I had done my undergrad elsewhere, I was eventually able to work in an area of my interest. I went to graduate school abroad and am now working in a research department in industry doing what I love.",1322322843

Two different cases come to mind:<p>In France, there was a movie called Etre et Avoir, about a teacher in a remote countryside village. No professional actors, no story, just some shots in a school. Who would have bet on it? Is it not obvious that spectators want action, glamour, movie stars?

3279929,comment,3279225,3279391,33,0,feral,,,">I would not fear this virus for the same reason that I do not fear Ebola or Marburg virus. Viruses that kill quickly and efficiently do not spread as well as those that cause some disease but allow their host to continue functioning more or less normally (all the while exposing many more to the virus).<p>I disagree with that argument.
Its almost right, but I think its perniciously wrong.<p>Its true that the most dangerous viruses, all other things being equal, are the ones with longer incubation time.  Outbreaks of Ebola have tended to wipe out an isolated population, and quickly 'burn themselves out'; this has substantially reduced their threat.<p>But that 'all other things being equal' part is important.
There's nothing that says a virus that kills quickly and efficiently can't also spread well.<p>You could have a flu virus, with 50% mortality, that is asymptotic for 5 days, and then kills quickly; but if that virus easily transfers airborne, it could still spread well.  The question is always whether each infected person can infect - on average - a little more than one other person; there's no reason a highly contagious flu couldn't do this in a 5 day window, and that makes it very scary.<p>In simple epidemic modeling terms, you've got a contagion rate Beta, and a recovery rate Gamma.  With fixed Beta, lower Gamma causes more spreading.  But even with a fairly high recovery rate, if Beta is high enough, the disease will spread effectively.<p>If humanity should fear anything, its viruses like these.  Its way above nuclear meltdowns, or climate change, in that respect.<p>>One final note on the bioweapon/bioterror angle: if you follow the thinking of the people that actually contemplate the use of bioweapons, you'll find that bioweapons are only ever considered as denial-of-area or knock-down agents.<p>Have you ever heard of these guys?  : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aum_Shinrikyo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aum_Shinrikyo</a>
These crazy bastards did a sarin attack on the Tokyo subway.
Wiki says: ""Over the next week, the full scale of Aum's activities was revealed for the first time. At the cult's headquarters in Kamikuishiki on the foot of Mount Fuji, police found explosives, chemical weapons and biological warfare agents, such as anthrax and Ebola cultures, and a Russian Mil Mi-17 military helicopter. The Ebola virus was delivered from Zaire in 1994""<p>I don't know how well sourced that wikipedia article is, but I've certainly read many places that they sent people to source Ebola in Africa.<p>These were not logical people, rationally planning military use scenarios, and weren't thinking about things like 'denial-of-area'.
There aren't many people like that in the world, but there's some.<p>>It won't wipe out the human race, but it does have a good chance of setting humanity back a decade or two<p>3 billion deaths would be an unprecedented human tragedy.  Its like flipping a coin, for each of your loved ones lives, if you want to personalise it. Its completely horrific, and we shouldn't lose sight of that, talking about 'being set back a decade or two'.<p>Furthermore, you'd probably be talking about complete social, economic, societal collapse. I'd imagine that would be very hard to recover from.<p>The prospect of something like this getting out is terrifying.  I'm a researcher, and I really think we should be pushing forward scientific progress.  But even the fact that there's a virus like this sitting in a lab somewhere is scary.  I hope its got an extremely high level of security.  What happens if a crazy group kidnaps one of the researcher's families?  I definitely understand why there's concern about making the 'steps to reproduce' available.<p>Several years ago, Bill Joy talked about having to censor certain intellectual information, for situations just such as this.
I thought he was a bit crazy at the time; but with developments like this, well, maybe there's an uncomfortable discussion to be had, here; personally, I need to think more about this.<p>> In my mind, though, this is all the more reason to publish this research and, while we're at it, pour some more money into the worldwide flu monitoring network.<p>Flu monitoring is probably not going to stop something like this if it appears in the wild - at least in terms of intervening to quarantine a particular variant.<p>If you look at the swine flu outbreak, in the early stages they were worried that the mortality was high (they didn't have good data).  But no attempt at containment was made; the time window for containment was effectively gone, by the time the virus came to our attention. (I can't find a source for this, but that's my recollection). (EDIT: Here's one source: <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/07/swine-flu-containment-is-dange.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/07/...</a>)<p>I attended a talk a couple of years ago:

The most interesting part of this article is which factory it is though, I am not sure of the percent of keyboards they make but I believe this is the fabled factory I was told about while in SE China that makes the majority of the keyboards in the world.<p>Just remember what happened at Foxconn before power to the people starts rolling off your tongue; they had the best working conditions in any Chinese factory(arguably), a number of suicides that was below the national average for the number of people working at the factory, but because they where Taiwanese owned the Chinese gov't let the media run with the Apple suicide link. Foxconn raised salaries and it all disappeared. This isn't a human rights situation, this is all about money on both sides.",1322320293

3279881,comment,3275869,3276793,1,0,geebee,,,"I can think of a couple of answers...<p>First is that no education should take place on someone else's dime.  Let the market sort it out.  So don't subsidize literature or mathematics, film studies or nuclear engineering.  Step back and let the market work it out.<p>The second is that the government should subsidize education, on the notion that some fields, such as science and engineering, generate positive externalities that can't be recouped by the practitioners of these fields.  As you can probably tell, I think there's a lot of merit to this argument, especially in core science.  I think that a scientist or engineer who earns 100K a year often generates far more wealth than, say, a mortgage broker who earns 100K a year.  It does make sense to me that the government would try to find ways to encourage this.<p>If you feel this way, you probably don't mind educational subsidies and tax breaks for certain types of activities (by the way, I read somewhere that China has excepted software engineers from certain types of income taxes).<p>While I probably sound enthusiastic about this kind of arrangement, the truth is I'm ambivalent about it, largely because I have serious doubts that this kind of government interference will work.  Instead, it often leads to a system that is easily gamed (engineering majors take the subsidy and then go work on wall street, and get a tax break because they write software for trading algorithms).<p>So in the end, I tend to favor a more hands-off, market based approach - though with some state subsidies for certain educational paths and research activity.<p>Lightweight yet effective and highly competent government... I do think it's possible, and the societies that figure it out will run circles around everyone else.",1322320153

The author also makes important mistakes regarding PL implementation. Examples follow.<p><i>""Without the need for a language, it also disappears the need for a compiler. Everything is such a system is already parsed and ready to use.""</i><p>A compiler is not just a parser! In fact, the parser is generally regarded as the easy, tedious part of a compiler. This confusion between the syntax of a language and its semantics undermines most of the purported benefits of his proposed ""languageless system"".<p><i>""Whatever the form used to interact with the program, a language-less system doesnt care if parts of the program are shaped as s-expressions or C blocks: it just combine them as needed to create a program.""</i><p>The difference between s-expressions and C blocks is not superficial: s-expressions present a natural API to the syntax of the programming language itself, allowing Lisp's distinctive feature: macros. Language syntax and language capabilities are not so easily separable!<p><i>""In a program written in this way, using garbage collection is just a matter of plugging the right run time support, which you could get along with the system or you could buy from a third party.""</i><p>Performant garbage collection algorithms need guarantees about the code they manage (eg. the ability to distinguish pointers from integers for precise GC, and write-barriers for incremental GC). Choice of GC algorithm affects the compilation and capabilities of your entire program, and even the ways you can interact with other programs! You can't just mix and match PL features you find from various languages and expect them not to conflict.",1322319958

Instead, we erroneously consider garbage collection as a fundamental attribute of the language in use. As another example, in a language agnostic system we would would be able to create and call closures by just adding a simple module to the system, not by devising yet another language that supports closures as a first class citizen.<p>> But the advantages dont stop there. Without the need for a language, it also disappears the need for a compiler. Everything is such a system is already parsed and ready to use.

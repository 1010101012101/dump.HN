The guys I knew at Citi had a small team but i'm not sure if they were direct hire or via contract, but they basically dealt with the low-hanging web-app-pentest-fruit.<p>I don't work for a financial company but I work for one that works for/with them. Their code review is more like: ""Hey, did you even test this code in QC? I can see a syntax error."" I don't think anyone here actively looks for security problems during review. If it compiles and it's sat in dev/qc for a month (we just assume it's been tested), it's pushed out. I don't think anybody here would recognize XSS if it hit them in the face, and this particular bug (""allow any authenticated user to view any URI matching a given string"") sounds suspiciously like a bad ACL rule in their identity/access management servers.<p>Edit: and the web app would have to not be rejecting access by an invalid user.

2658273,comment,2654220,2654220,1,0,chrishaum,,,"Yes, I can see how you would see it this way. Heck, even I did, until a few weeks ago, when I a) began working (unpaid) for Zannee, and b) read Rich Dad, Poor Dad.<p>Here are just a few thoughts about why I made this request as I did:<p>We aren't forcing anyone to take an internship with Zannee. This isn't slave labor - no one has to work for free against their will. If people don't see the value in an internship with Zannee, they won't take us up on our offer. No harm done!<p>We are looking for students who are trying to expand their education, who want to take their own entrepreneurial and programming educations into their own hands. We will give them enough structure that they can feel supported as they learn and improve their skills, but not enough to constrict them - we keep it flexible and give them significant autonomy.<p>Rich Dad, Poor Dad teaches that to be wealthy, you should not work for a wage; instead, you should work to learn - to gain skills and knowledge that you can apply in building your own business (your ""business of you""). No, we aren't paying, but this <i>is</i> a profitable company selling B2B software online. If you are a young entrepreneur who wants to learn how to successfully ideate, implement, market, sell, support, upsell, and grow a B2B software product, what better opportunity could there be?<p>Remember how I said above that I myself am working unpaid? That wasn't a typo. I thoroughly believe that Dane has the knowledge, skills, and experience (obtained through intelligent hard work and lots of practice in his business) to help a mature, driven student with entrepreneurial desires and programming skills learn how to start and grow a successful B2B software business. That's why I flew out to Des Moines, Iowa, all on my own dime, leaving my friends and the wonderful restaurants of New York City, to work for Dane - for FREE - for the summer.<p>You might think that Dane is taking advantage of me, but I disagree. It's a win-win situation. He gets free labor to help with growing his business. I get access to invaluable knowledge, skills, and one-on-one time with a successful entrepreneur, not to mention access to his network of entrepreneurs and businesspeople! It's a big win for both of us.<p>For students (or non-students even - I could care less) who want to have their own profitable B2B software business, this really is the chance of a lifetime.",1308160699

2658271,comment,2657554,2657964,2,0,Symmetry,,,"The words ""introvert"" and ""extrovert"" have been used by a lot of people over the years, starting all the way back at Freud I think.  If a modern scientist uses these words, though, they're probably talking about it in terms of the Big Five[1] personality model, which is mostly just identifying some observed clusters of traits with strong correlations that tend to persist over a person's life.  People argue about whether there might be more emperical clusters worth adding, or whether they might be made more orthogonal but generally there's a good amount of rigor behind them, far more than IQ for instance.<p>Introversion/Extroversion is very much a matter of degree, just like pretty much any other human trait.  It doesn't uniquely determine behavior by any means, humans are very complex creatures.   However, there is a pretty strong correlation [2] between someone acting in an introverted or extroverted manner in one situation and acting the same way later.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation</a><p>EDIT:  All of which isn't to say that people can't use those terms in pseudo-scientific ways, or that the author of the article isn't.

Layers of abstractions and ORMs in particular are generally good thingsbut they can't do magic when it comes to dealing with SQL.<p>If you're going to be using an ORM, I'd strongly recommend rethinking your data store. Object databases such as MongoDB is a perfect fit, but even a key-value store like Cassandra would be a much better option than SQL. I think it's interesting to note that Core Data, Cocoa's ORM, is one of the fastest data store out there. It uses SQLite, but defines its own schemas.

2658216,comment,2657554,2657554,76,0,dkarl,,,"Just somebody (presumably an introvert) denying common negative generalizations about introverts without providing any supporting references or analysis. Turns out (thank you, oblique63) it was an off-the-cuff list thought up by someone who read a self-help book and was inspired to ""redefine [his] entire life in a new and positive context.""<p>Seeing introversion as a preference or identity is fine as long as you have a nice consistently introverted life and that's exactly what you want, but it harks back to the day when everybody had their place and accepted their limitations and anyone who felt any conflict or frustration about it was ""maladjusted.""  If you're introverted and want some of the benefits of extroversion, such as a bigger social network for locating jobs and meeting women, or if you discover that you really enjoy a hobby that has a large incidental but unavoidable social component, then you're supposed to realize those things are ""just not you"" and go home and read a book.<p>Introversion as an identity is a nice explanation when you really don't want to do something.  ""What, you don't want to go to the Nicki Minaj concert?""  ""Let me explain.  You see, I'm an introvert....""  But what explanation do you give yourself when you really want to go see a certain band but you think the social aspect will drain you so much it will be hard to enjoy?  There's no simple ""I like this"" or ""I don't like this.""  There's a conflict that can't be resolved.  What do you do when you realize it's nice to have a big diverse circle of friends sometimes -- for trying to round people up for certain activities, or so you aren't limited to the tastes of your one or two really close friends -- but maintaining that social network is intimidating and draining and you don't know if you're up to it?  Introversion starts to seem less like a matter of taste and more like a limitation you're fighting against.<p>It's nice to say you're a picky person who doesn't like superficial relationships, who only wants a handful of close friends you can engage with in a meaningful way, but then you plan a backpacking trip and realize there's some climbing involved and it isn't safe to go alone.  You could limit yourself to whatever your friends like to do.  But the trip sounds really cool, and now that you think about it, you're pretty sure you'd enjoy rock climbing in itself.  Wait, there's a problem.  Learning basic rock climbing doesn't intimidate you, but you will have to meet people who like climbing, meet enough of them and cultivate enough social connections to put together three or four people to do this hike.  What would sound fun to an extrovert -- meet a bunch of new people who share my interests, yay! -- poses a tough decision for the introvert.  Do I really want to do this?  Will it be worth it?  Am I even capable of doing it?  It will involve a lot of social interaction, and I don't know if I can muster enough smalltalk and conviviality or if I'll get tired, zone out, fail to engage and be engaging.<p>That brings up another matter of ""taste.""  It would be nice to say I'm simply bored by smalltalk, but I can't kid myself; it isn't that simple.  I know that once in a while I <i>do</i> like smalltalk, and when I think about it my ability to enjoy a social situation has more to do with my mood going into it than the situation itself.  I get bored when I'm not engaged, and I have difficulty engaging with people because anxiety and stress make me shut down.  When I'm overflowing with positive feelings, I have no problem engaging with people and enjoying smalltalk.  So the problem isn't smalltalk, unless I want to say that I'm stupid to enjoy it when I do, and right to be bored when it bores me.<p>I could resolve all these problems by having a consistent life and molding my tastes to coincide with my comfort zone.  I could just <i>happen</i> to prefer hobbies that shelter me from social situations or bring me together with other introverts instead of forcing me into uncomfortable situations.  It's great when it works out that way, and it's certainly a major factor in how I manage to enjoy life!  But I chafe against it.  I'm maladjusted.  I don't like tailoring my life to my natural limitations any more than I like tailoring my life to other people's expectations.   My introversion messes with me, so I mess with it right back.  Sometimes, when I can afford the energy.",1308160103

We do a ton of web app security assessments, network vuln/pen testing, etc. A while back one of our clients (large financial) hired us to do a spear phishing simulation. ""Show us how people are still able to get in and show us how they are able to get out"". So we did it all manually both the phishing as well as going on site to to data exfiltration to see how we could get around their outbound firewall rules, IDS/IPS, DLP, proxies, sniffers, etc. We figured out how to do all of these successfully and were able to ""steal"" some fake credit card numbers.<p>We lost a lot of money on that engagement. :) We went waaay over margin. So we started thinking how can we automate this and make it a repeatable process that customers can run on an on-demand and on-going basis. Security is who we are and in our blood. We we started coding...<p>And here we are.<p>So there are two sides:<p>1. Web based spear phishing engine that sends out ""malicious"" emails with all kinds of different options (e.g. malicious attachments, links to malicious web sites, 'your pass expired, enter it here!' sites, etc.) We track who clicked on what, who has out of date Acrobat, Flash, Java, etc.<p>2. Bottom line is that phishers will ALWAYS get people to click on something. No matter what. And the attacker only needs 1 person to do it. Just 1. So let's assume that we're going to eventually get in. We have an on-demand executable that mimics attacker malware complete with ninja-sneaky network tricks that phones home fake credit card numbers, .rar files, all kinds of cool network trickery.<p>All of the above is run by the end user and presented in a nice web UI so a security guy/gal can make intelligent decisions on where their security is good and where it sucks.<p>We're super excited about our new service and we hope everyone else is too.

2658160,comment,2657554,2658073,5,0,bluekeybox,,,"> Why are extraverts so threatened by anyone who won't interact with them on their terms?<p>I act as an extravert in certain situations and as an introvert in others, so I feel qualified to answer your question. Extraverts don't always interact with everyone -- for example, in circles where social cliques are established, extraverts will interact with people outside of their clique less often. I call this ""exclusionary"" behavior -- one that serves to maintain the exclusiveness of the clique. Given that cases of extreme introversion are rare, an extravert A is more likely to interpret another individual B (who could well be an extreme introvert) as another extravert who simply shuns individual A so as to exclude A from his or her clique.<p>The reason this ""misinterpretation"" occurs is because extreme introversion is rare (1% of the population?) while exclusionary behavior (shunning others to maintain exclusive cliques) is relatively highly prevalent (20% of the population?). So the conditional probability that individual B is not an introvert but an extravert exhibiting exclusionary behavior is high. Basically, the extravert A makes a correct conclusion given the limited information he/she possesses. Because the introvert B is unlikely to engage into conversation with A, the individual A will never gain more information about B and will therefore maintain the conclusion that B is an asshole.",1308159411

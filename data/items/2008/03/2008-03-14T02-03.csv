In fact, the target market is adults who have a life.  Like me!  I do stuff, you know.  I'm about to go do stuff now.  (Upgrade tinymce.)",1205463210

In other words, make it easy for you to test a different layout against the existing one.  10-20% of your users should see the test design.  This will give you concreate data on how your changes improve things like stickiness and ad clicks.  Keep what works.  Rinse, repeat, get rich :)",1205462795

1) A separate classifier would have to trained for each user and this would take too much resources.
2) I think an SVM would require too many training cases before it becomes useful.<p>If you know different, let me know.",1205461270

I haven't read any of the papers yet, but looking at the abstract of ""Language Oriented Programming"" by M. P. Ward, there does seem to be a difference between his idea and your approach with Arc and your other projects.<p>In the abstract, Ward defines Language Oriented Programming as defining a formal description of the language to develop the type of application in question, and then write the application in that language, and implement the compiler using existing tools.<p>The problem I see with this approach is that it's rare to know ahead of time what the ideal language for an application should look like. I don't think you're really going to know until you try to develop it. That's how the Arc approach differs. Particularly when you're already working in a language with rich meta-programming/code generation capabilities, I don't think there's any reason to have a strict separation of the phases. Even if you're not using a language with innate code generation, it's still possible to iterate back and forth between writing the application and changing the language/compiler<p>Keep in mind I haven't read the whole paper yet, or any of the related work, so the methodology might not be as strict as I've presented.",1205461236

These processes seem pretty obvious for success, though, so I'm not surprised they make 10 comps for each feature. It ensures the absolute best.",1205460926

We're aware it's not rocket science and we're not going to get rich with it. But we had fun in the process and it allowed us to experiment with a few toys: Rails, Google AdSense, Amazon associates. Our 4 sites have been running for a week now, and we would be interested to get your feedback on about anything related to those sites.<p>Here for starters: Do you like the simple design? Any suggestions to maximize the revenue? Is it a good choice to use Google AdSense on these kinds of sites? What's your experience with being an Amazon associate (our ads in the bottom-left corner)?",1205460440

I guess the part of encryption I was focusing on is the part that does heavy-duty bit-crunching during the actual encryption/decryption process, which <i>must</i> be exact if you want to get back the same data you started with.",1205460193

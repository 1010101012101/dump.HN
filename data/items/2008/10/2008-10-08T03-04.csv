326318,comment,326277,326277,0,0,randomwalker,,,"I like the ""bus factor"" discussion. It's #3 in the article. In the projects I've been a lead on, the bus factor is in a sense 1: each hacker is responsible for their own module, and while others might read their code, they don't contribute (except report bugs).<p>However, the modules are set up so that there is a clean separation between them, with all interaction being through well defined API's. In fact, each hacker typically uses their own server unless/until efficiency constraints force us to do otherwise. So far it's worked well. If one person goes away, the project can continue until they come back or one of the others can learn/duplicate their module.<p>This allows us to dramatically increase prototyping speed, but may not be sustainable as project size increases.<p>I'm fairly inexperienced, so I'd like to know what you guys think about this practice, since it's something I think about a lot.",1223436676

Have fine print that it's a donation if they do pay anything, but the program works perfectly with no warnings or anything of the sort, completely free. It's all a clever scheme though, and I didn't mean it in any seriousness.<p>Now, back to my original comment, people tie prices closely to expectations as well as perceived quality.",1223436145

326314,comment,326108,326108,0,0,netcan,,,"One thing to remember is that any large economic upturn or downturn is more a sideturn then anything else.<p>How much 'consumers' spend only moves a little bit. Even if your market is marks 'decline in GDP' exactly, you probably have such a small portion of it that it is indistinguishable from the effects of any of the normal factors that have an effect on sales.<p>But when you get into little areas, there's big changes. Markets can double, halve or stay the same. Common sense says luxuries go down, basics stay similar & thrift items go up. Theoretically, there are almost as many opportunities to be expected as threats.",1223435370
326313,comment,325665,326026,0,0,olefoo,,,"Bah. Enough with the false dualism, there are plenty of other operating systems and software vendors out there; most of them speak standard protocols.<p>Here is an experiment you should try, go down to your local public library and do a quick census of who is running what on their own computers. You may be surprised at the diversity that is actually out there.",1223435157

Unfortunately, we're all surrounded by clocks.  Or maybe just I am.  I can see three (including the upper-right OS X clock) from where I sit, and every cellphone has a clock, too.",1223435047

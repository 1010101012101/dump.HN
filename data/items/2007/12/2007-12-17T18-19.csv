Ebay relies on a network effect; Amazon doesn't. <p>I don't imagine that he forgot it; I think he's assuming most web startups rely on it. He is, after all, Pyra, Odeo, and Twitter.",1197915717

Firstly, Microsoft has been selling the whole 'automated assistant' thing to us for YEARS.  Clippy is just one hideous example.<p>Secondly, automated inbox processing has been around for _years_.  My POPFile open source program is now over 5 years old and there are older examples than that (I was doing automated emailing sorting in the late 90s and others before me).   So multi-core machines are what's holding this back?  What a joke.<p>Thirdly, it mentions features (looking at who I correspond with) that are already available (see Xobni and others).  And automatic response systems are also around to deal with customer service.<p>Sorry, for the rant put two pages of fluff about multi-core processors with some freak out speculation about email processing that's been available for a long time.<p>How about talking about something interesting, like parallel aware languages (Occam, erlang, ...)?",1197914692

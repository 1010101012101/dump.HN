BTW I think it's true that opportunity equality doesn't exist or is seriously undermined, but the above isn't meaningful evidence for or against.<p>This is what's wrong with social science -- a single observation with no meaningful controls is put forth as evidence for or against a claim.<p>Those who deny that equality of opportunity exists will use the above result to support their view -- only 6% of the population moved from the bottom to the top. That's deplorable, yes?<p>Those who support the idea that equality of opportunity exists will use the same numbers in support of the opposite conclusion -- after all, a full 6% of those at the bottom made it to the top. Excuse me? It's only meaningful if 100% of those at the bottom arrive at the top? But that undermines the meaning of ""bottom"" and ""top"" and makes the entire exercise meaningless. Surely you don't think everyone at the bottom must end up at the top, do you? That confuses equality of opportunity with equality of outcome.<p>See the problem? The argument in the linked article is meaningless because it can be used to argue for either side of the issue with equal justice.",1361131196

5236465,comment,5235955,5235955,4,0,nswanberg,,,"This interview with Girl Talk [1] posted on the thread about Wanz [2] shows, to an outsider,  a lot of parallels between the music and startup scenes.<p>This is likely to have been raised before, but the two are similar in many ways: vast and fragmented with many paths to and definitions of success, prone to fads, full of both hard workers and poseurs, controlled near the top by gatekeepers who pride themselves, correctly or not, on evaluating potential success, jealousy of success, rules that apply to the majority of aspirants and smaller players but not the minority of the very successful, people who look with disdain at others' choices, seeing those choices as more important than they really are, etc.<p>So it is good to realize that, just as in music, success is context-dependent, and one's popularity with the current stars and hangers-on is a weak indicator of success, and it's good to act on that realization in a useful way, including planting a stake in the ground saying ""I'm done with that.""<p>That said, once one's self-confidence and happiness are restored it's also good to not completely reject all aspects of whatever and whoever are popular. Unless someone is a close competitor (in which case they must be crushed or scared off to other pastures ;) ), why not wish for their success and celebrate it? Similarly, conferences are a great way to learn, to teach, and to meet those with the same interests, and so long as attending the conference is not only about being seen by others as attending a conference (or, say, being invited to a panel), and going does not interfere with work, why shouldn't one go?<p>[1] <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6415-girl-talk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6415-girl-talk/</a>

Other some other means of selecting arbitrary charsets but Unicode is hard enough as it is.<p>- On that note, using language-specific instead of byte-specific functions. This itself has its own large pitfalls (e.g. even something as simple as using foo.toUppercase() instead of foo.tr('a-z', 'A-Z') simply doesn't make sense in <i>all</i> languages, but at least it's better than what you had before).<p>- Having hooks for displaying dates in the user's preferred format.<p>- Advanced mode: Having hooks for operating on dates in a non-Gregorian calendar!<p>- Having hooks for proper currency handling and display.<p>- Having hooks for properly translating pluralized words. This is way worse than it sounds. In English you generally have ""1 of"", ""none of"", and ""2+ of"" that you might have to worry about, but other languages may have significantly more options, or entirely different ways of binning which categories an ordinal phrase falls into.<p>- Having hooks to supply ""context"" to a translator. E.g. talking about an ""elevator"" in the context of choosing an I/O scheduler may give an entire sentence a far different structure than using the same word ""elevator"" in the context of vertical transportation.<p>- Speaking of context, there's the problem of properly handling placeholder text in printf-style format strings. The translators may have to re-order the placeholders entirely to get it to translate right.<p>Even this is just kind of scratching the surface, I haven't talked about things like graphics, audio, etc.<p>Now, l10n is the process of actually going through and making the changes needed for a given locale. This doesn't just mean language, it can also include regional aspects. E.g. Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR) may end up with a different appearance than Portugal's Portuguese (pt_PT) [1].<p>Even American English (en_US) and British English (en_GB) have famous differences which go into far more than just s/truck/lorry/, but into things such as units (even gallons are not the same). All of which must be handled to have a proper localization.<p>In code terms you might say that i18n is refactoring to have a proper interface for usage by subclasses, while l10n is the art of <i>making</i> a specific subclass for that i18n interface for a given regional locale.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2005/10/msg00077.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2005/10/msg00077.html</a>",1361130078

5236360,comment,5235343,5236033,17,0,ScottBurson,,,"Permit me to disagree with the distinguished Mr. Thompson.  There wasn't quite ""no reason"".<p>First off, the notion of a personal workstation was just getting started back then.  It was entirely reasonable for the MIT AI lab to want to build some workstations for its researchers, who had previously been sharing a PDP-10.  There wasn't, in 1979, any off-the-shelf machine with virtual memory and bitmapped graphics that you could just buy.  The original PDP-11 had a completely inadequate 16-bit address space.  The first VAX model, the 11/780, was too expensive to be a single-user workstation.  The 11/750, released in October 1980, was cheaper, but I think still too expensive for the purpose (though a lot of them were sold as timesharing systems, of course).<p>In any case, workstations started to be big business in the 1980s, and through the 1990s.  Apollo, Silicon Graphics (SGI), and of course Sun Microsystems all enjoyed substantial success.  The fact that DEC didn't own this market speaks clearly to the unsuitability of the 11/750 for this purpose.<p>Also, the extreme standardization of CPU architectures that we now observe -- with x86 and ARM being practically the only significant players left -- hadn't occurred yet at that time.  It was much more common then than now for someone building a computer to design their own CPU and instruction set.<p>None of that has to do with Lisp specifically, but it does put some context around the AI Lab's decision to design and build their own workstation.  If they wanted workstations in 1980, they really had no choice.<p>And the tagged architecture did have some interesting and useful properties.  One of them was incremental garbage collection, made possible by hardware and microcode support.  We still don't have a true equivalent on conventional architectures, though machines are so fast nowadays that GC pauses are rarely onerous for interactive applications.<p>Another consequence was a remarkable level of system robustness.  It soon became routine for Lisp machines to stay up for weeks on end, despite the fact that they ran entirely <i>in a single address space</i> -- like running in a single process on a conventional machine -- and were being used for software, even OS software, development.  The tagging essentially made it impossible for an incorrect piece of code to scribble over regions of memory it wasn't supposed to have access to.<p>Obviously Lisp Machines didn't take over the world, but it wasn't really until the introduction of the Sun 4/110 in 1987 (IIRC) that there was something overwhelmingly superior available.<p>If Thompson had said simply that it was clear from the trends in VLSI that there would eventually be a conventional machine that was so much faster and cheaper than it would be possible to make Lisp Machines -- simply because conventional machines would be sold in much greater volume -- that Lisp Machines would be unviable, I would be forced to agree with him.  But that had not yet happened in 1979.<p>EDITED to add:<p>One more point.  The first CPU that was cheap enough to use in a workstation and powerful enough that you would have wanted to run Lisp on it was the 68020; and that didn't come out until 1984.",1361129545

If so, be willing to consider leaving your job, and going to live in another country where you can both get residency status.<p>It may also be an option for you two to spend blocks of time in each others countries so that you stay under the visa-free travel requirements.  For example, my girlfriend is from a Schengen country and I'm a California native.  We can both spend 90 days out of every 6 months in each others' country, and do a bit of travel together in other countries.  This has enabled us to let the relationship progress at a natural pace, and not rush into marriage for visa/citizenship reasons.  I think that's really important.

That's the very core idea of evented servers.<p>Within a single request, Node can async its dealing with outside services (databases, api's, etc), but it is still only processing one request at a time. There is no 'synchronized' keyword in javascript. ;-)<p>Check this out:<p><a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing#heroku-headers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing#heroku-he...</a><p>There is an interesting header in there: X-Heroku-Dynos-In-Use. From what I understand, this header is the number of dynos that a router is communicating with. For us, this is always around 2-3.<p>I suspect that the router is just a dumb nginx process sitting in front of my app. It is setup to communicate with 2-3 of my dyno's in a round robin fashion. If any one of those dyno's doesn't process the request fast enough, then requests start to back up. Once requests start to back up past 30s worth of execution, the router starts just killing those queued requests instead of just leaving them in a queue or sending the requests to another set of dyno's. Even worse is if you have a dyno that crashes (nodejs likes to crash at the first sign of an exception). I suspect that is why we see 2 or 3 in that header.<p>I think that part of the problem is that the routers don't just start talking to more dyno's if you have them available. So, it doesn't matter if you have 50, 200, 500 dyno's because the router is always only talking to a small subset of them. Even if you add more dyno's in the middle of heavy requests, you are still stuck with H12 for the existing dyno's. A full system restart is necessary then.",1361128502

5236240,comment,5235415,5235415,8,0,fakeer,,,"Been to Korea 4 times. To work(read slave off by choice), while my visa was business. 
On whichever weekend I was left alone by my firm I spent it in travelling around, trying things out, meeting people and trying to strike a conversation. Elderly people were extremely polite and courteous and extremely reserved too. Maybe because of the huge language barrier(any language other than Korean has very limited reception in Korea) which is IMHO, though very difficult for me, something South Koreans should be proud of - being self sufficient without English(the colonial hangover) which has crept into social DNA everywhere else.<p>Yes, the 'family' seems to be non-existent in Korea now, following the western tracks. This assumption is based upon external observation and talking to my Korean guest-house people, some staff who are from India/Pakistan/Nepal(either Korean citizens now or having lived their long), colleagues(friends let's say) who ever opened up on such matters(usually after a few drinks). I can confirm that after a few drinks every society becomes one and social taboos are duly f<i></i><i></i>d off. Most open were(once they are open) Korean females friends I have known their, whether met in office or outside - they talked very animatedly about their parents and how they don't find time for each other and most likely will never find it. They also are worried whether their own state is going to be worse than this. Here's the last line of the article, <i>""When I see these old people, I see how my own generation will die.""</i>.<p>One answer was common. Your parents bring you up till you get your job and are on your feet, after that you are on your own. And they(parents) are on their own too!<p>They usually spend their time in shops alone and sitting alone in those park benches with those stoic faces. A very healthy life style/food makes the matters worse(as in loneliness) as the life expectancy is quite high in SK. Maybe that's a saving grace in India(my country) as families are slowly disappearing here too, and/or turning into dysfunctional arrangements which is not even a distant resemblance of glorious old Indian family.<p>As for social care - politicians are very corrupt and do surpass even US standards. In US at least even heavyweights get long imprisonments. In Korea they get parliamentary pardon. Nobody cares about national elderly population(besides, just paying bills is hardly they want/need). So, while everyone is busy taking share prices higher and higher and building new things, the last generation - which is no longer a workforce - is left behind in the race; mercilessly abandoned.",1361127725

5236236,comment,5197155,5197155,1,0,benzesandbetter,,,"A couple possibilities.  If you really enjoy doing these things for their own sake, you can treat your side projects as a hobby and stop beating yourself up about it.  Spend all the time you want going down the rabbit hole, and enjoy that it provides a chance to think deeply, making something as close to perfection as possible, and be fully present in the experience of creating.<p>The other approach I'd suggest is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum.  Start treating your side projects like a real business, and create some process that connects real incentives to them.  There are harder and softer ways to approach this.  You can quit your job and now you have the focus in your side projects that you need to ship to get paid.  You could also keep your day job and set up some automatic funds transfers into a semi-liquid asset like a CD or 401k, such that you leave yourself enough to cover the basic expenses, but so that the marginal income from your side project becomes significant enough to be motivational.  Revenue is a great feedback loop getting you to focus on what matters, and letting go of what really doesn't.<p>You could also bring in another person, perhaps as a business partner, or simply have one of your friends agree to call you up once a week and have you give them a report.  The key here is to clarify and draw attention in your mind to the work that you're avoiding, and the outcome that you want.  In this process, it's important to vividly color the positive outcome be emphasizing the real changes it will create in your life.<p>For example:
""This week, instead of shipping my product which will enable me to quit working for other people, spend more time with my family, own the high-performance german cars I've always wanted, and visit 20+ countries a year, I instead spend 6.5 hours working on a sort algorithm, and 5.4 hours fiddling with the presentation styles on the country-list drop-down menu in my app.""<p>I used all of the techniques above when I was starting my first company, and they made a big difference in helping me focus on what was important in getting to market, and not OCD-ing out on things that were, ultimately, minor details.",1361127682

9113931,comment,9112305,9112305,0,0,OMGBrewmaster,,,"Allowing developers to pay for promoted placement is a terrible idea for Google Play&#x27;s users, for app developers and for Google. Google Play users will now see more exploitative apps that are visible in search results not because they have earned high ratings from users or have a low uninstall rate, but because they are able to extract more money from each user to pay for their placement. App developers with quality products -- especially those with small development studios like my own -- will be put at a further disadvantage from the likes of King.com, Supercell and Zynga, whose high ARPU can justify this sort of promotion. And while Google will initially be able to extract more cash from the app economy than the 30% it already does, by diluting the value of Google Play search results for their users and by incentivizing developers to make exploitative rather than quality products, mobile device owners will become more motivated to migrate to other app stores and possibly other platforms.<p>I wish that Google would concentrate on its core strength and develop a search system for apps that directs its users to what they will appreciate and enjoy rather than what will cost them the most money, and that would encourage developers to aim for quality rather than exploitation.",1424973467

I cannot stress that point enough. Instead they log form submissions (e.g. POST requests) which give the malware author much more useful information they can data mine in an automated way (e.g. URL, named parameters, etc). This works even on a &quot;secure&quot; page (e.g. HTTPS with extended certificate).<p>I&#x27;m super tired of supposed power users or &quot;geeks&quot; telling others to copy/paste in their username/passwords to improve security. That&#x27;s not how this works, it isn&#x27;t how any of this works. Nobody reads raw key-streams, they&#x27;re completely useless because they fail to contain CONTEXT (i.e. where you typed what).<p>Sorry, just a pet peeve of mine. The term &quot;keylogger&quot; is largely a misnomer. A more accurate name would be &quot;credential hijacking&quot; or &quot;form submission theft.&quot; A lot of malware actually use standard injected JavaScript to add event hooks to a page, to fire the data back to a evil browser extensions.",1424973440

9113922,comment,9112296,9113633,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Just for anyone who is reading this and wondering if they could or should be saving up this kind of fund, here&#x27;s a very simple but not unrealistic example.<p>Suppose you&#x27;re working in software development in the UK, recently graduated and now with a little experience but still quite early in your career.<p>If you&#x27;re outside London and living in a shared place, maybe your salary is £30k, and your monthly living costs for rent, bills, and essentials like food and travel are £1,500. Your net monthly income after taxes and student loan repayments is probably about £1,850.<p>So, you have a surplus of £350 per month. If you set that aside throughout your next year of employment, sticking it in an ISA (a tax-exempt savings account), then by the end of that year you have nearly three months of safety margin.<p>Suppose, ignoring inflation to make the maths easy, that your salary increases at about 10% that year, without any negotiation or changing jobs. Now your take-home pay is probably about £2,000 after deductions, giving you a £500 surplus each month. If you saved that away the following year, you&#x27;d have more than 6 months of safety margin set aside within 2 years of starting to save.<p>Of course these are just example figures, hopefully not unrealistic for someone early in a software development career in the UK today, and they ignore any one-off major expenses you might have like getting a car serviced and MOT&#x27;d once a year or taking a foreign holiday. But even if you do those things, you can surely still save <i>something</i>, and when it comes to having a bit in reserve in case your career hits a bump, anything is better than nothing.<p>Edit: After checking a few prices, it turns out that some costs of living have gone up much less than I expected since I was that young. :-) So actually £1,500 is probably a lot more than you really need to spend on essentials under the conditions I mentioned, even if you&#x27;re living in a tech-focussed area, and saving a few months&#x27; worth of essentials expenses should be much quicker than I worked out above.",1424973423

I&#x27;d be keen to see any examples though – it would be awesome if there was something to fall back on.<p>All I can find is evidence that it would be at best very risky to rely on an implied patent grant.<p>For example, it&#x27;s considered unclear enough that the ClearBSD license was explicitly created to clarify that it doesn&#x27;t offer patent grants - <a href=""http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:ClearBSD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:ClearBSD</a><p>Even more damning:<p><i>In the absence of an explicit patent grant, but considering the word use in the license, can we assume that the BSD license impliedly grants enough of whatever patent rights the Univer- sity of California then owned that a licensee may use the soft- ware as it was originally distributed by the University? Most licensees under the BSD assume it does on the theory that oth- erwise the copyright license would be of no value. What good, they say, is software that can be copied but not used?<p>Such a conclusion is not based on the law of licenses. Indeed, a bare license of copyright need not include a bare license of patent at all. It is only if the BSD is viewed as a contract that we can introduce contract law principles such as reliance or reasonable expectations of the parties. If software is licensed under the BSD without forming a contract between licensor and licensee, the extent of any patent grant is at best ambiguous.<p>As to whether an implied grant of patent rights extends to versions of the software with modifications, that’s an even more complicated question. The BSD license is silent about a patent license for derivative works. So if a licensee improves the origi- nal Berkeley Software Distribution in a way that infringes a patent owned by the University of California, there is no easy way of knowing whether an implied BSD patent license includes a patent license for that improvement.<p>Since courts are likely to construe implied grants of license narrowly, a licensee should consider obtaining separately from the licensor an explicit grant of patent rights that might be needed for modified versions of BSD-licensed software.</i><p><pre><code>  http://rosenlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/Academic-Licenses.pdf</code></pre>",1424973322

WebRTC wants to find peers on the local LAN, and communicate with them directly.  Why not let the browser find peers, and then hand the WebRTC application a connection without exposing where that connection leads?<p>That said, long-term, I think networks need to stop treating non-routability alone as a firewall mechanism.  Any information that this WebRTC mechanism reveals could also be exploited by any random client application, or in the case of http-based protocols, by anyone who can embed an iframe or submit a form.

It might be fine for &quot;enterprise deployments&quot; where a company has a lot of time, money and resources to throw at the implementation. In my opinion the average end user is going to get lost in the details of how these systems interconnect and work together. Debugging some of the more complex issues that they will face will be challenging.<p>Even Exhibitor is not a silver bullet for managing ZK. It helps with rolling restarts and lets you do a sort of MySQL-esque bin-log replay of your state, but even with Exhibitor, it&#x27;s not going to make for a smooth recovery at 4:00AM when PagerDuty rings.<p>The underlying design of how Mesos and Marathon communicate create situations where they have differing views of the state of the cluster, and you end up with &quot;orphans&quot; which are tasks that Mesos is aware of but Marathon knows nothing about.<p>In my opinion, the system feels like it was designed to be something else, and then all this functionality was tacked on later. Coincidentally that is exactly what the case is with Mesos. I think there is a lot of room for an improved user experience that these tools will struggle to provide.",1424973176

It&#x27;s likely that, in that moment, the user&#x27;s amygdala has started sounding an alarm that the brain&#x27;s prediction about the outcome of an operation did not come true. It is, quite literally, an emotional moment. A feeling of vulnerability, even if only for an instant, is the first and most profound response when a user encounters an error. Humans further tend to anthropomorphize the systems they interact with - a natural shortcut the brain takes to understand a system that seems to have intelligence - and a cold, unforgiving error message lashing out in a moment of vulnerability seems almost malevolent.<p>Content: If error messages considered the momentary mental state of a user when they&#x27;re feeling raw from their expectation not being met - the error resulting from their action - they would be more helpful to the user, and allow them to be self-sufficient, which increases their feeling of well-being and satisfaction with a system.

Consider what St. Isaac of Syria says:<p>&quot;The humble man approaches wild animals, and the moment they catch sight of him their ferocity is tamed. They come up and cling to him as their Master, wagging their tails and licking his hands and feet. They scent as coming from him the same fragrance that came from Adam before the transgression, the time when they were gathered together before him and he gave them names in Paradise. This scent was taken away from us, but Christ has renewed it and given it back to us at his coming. It is this which has sweetened the fragrance of humanity.&quot;<p>To an Orthodox Christian, restoring the relationship of humanity with animals, which includes that of their expressing intelligence, love, and other such &quot;human-like&quot; traits, is to work towards restoration of our pre-fallen state. The Image of God lies not just in these traits... without going into a deep discussion here, for Orthodox this Image can be seen in the Transfiguration of Christ: that of glorified, deified[1] humanity united with the energy[2] of God.<p>Some more information is available here: <a href=""http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/misc/flanagan_humans_animals.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/misc/flana...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://orthodoxwiki.org/Theosis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orthodoxwiki.org/Theosis</a>

But just to play devil&#x27;s advocate for a second -- for any given role, is your variance really <i>that</i> high? Do you expect to field a dramatically variable range of candidates for the same level, title, or position? So variable, in fact, that establishing a ballpark range is an exercise in futility?<p>If you&#x27;re fielding candidates with N years of experience, 1.5N years of experience, or 2N+ years of experience for the same role, maybe it&#x27;s worth recalibrating your expectations for that role.

Something bad happens to your child => you feel guilty. You have the urge to do something about it, and while you cannot control lots of things, you can decide whether to vaccinate. This is similar to how people get eating disorders: food is often times the only thing they can control in their lives.<p>This was interesting to me because I cannot fathom how you can stare facts in the face and stubbornly disagree, putting your own child at a huge risk.

The legitimate BIOS then adds in a hash of the boot sector, which adds in a hash of the kernel, which adds in a hash of anything the kernel thinks is worth verifying. Only if the final value of this TPM register (called a &quot;PCR&quot;) matches up will the TPM allow a stored private key to be unlocked (&quot;unsealed&quot;) and used.<p>Alternatively, for so-called &quot;dynamic root of trust&quot;, there&#x27;s a processor instruction that both clears all processor state (interrupts, paging, etc.) and a particular TPM PCR, and loads in a block of code. If the code is different, the key won&#x27;t unseal. If someone is intercepting that processor instruction, the PCR won&#x27;t get initialized correctly, and the key still won&#x27;t unseal.<p>So it&#x27;s mostly up to the kernel to verify everything that could possibly be relevant. (If you&#x27;re thinking this is a hard engineering task, yes, that&#x27;s one reason why this isn&#x27;t in wide deployment, despite the technology all existing.) For instance, it might verify an entire read-only root filesystem, and then set things up so that on the work container or VM, nothing else can be installed, no additional executables or libraries or LD_PRELOADs get loaded, debuggers don&#x27;t work, etc. In the personal-use container/VM, it can still run a normal OS.",1424971231

9113632,comment,9111093,9113450,0,0,drostie,,,"Close but not quite. The term &quot;universality&quot; is different in phase transition theory from what it means in random matrix theory (which is what&#x27;s at play here), but they&#x27;ve got some similarities too.<p>In phase transition theories, you&#x27;ve got two different states (like liquid water and water vapor), and when you vary some high-level parameters (like pressure and temperature) you can go from one of these states to the other. This means that the only &quot;interesting&quot; physics (in the sense of &quot;distinct from the well-understood liquid/gas behavior&quot; can only happen right as you get near that transition, so that liquids are seamlessly becoming gases which are seamlessly becoming liquids again. The &quot;transition&quot; allows a lot of behavior not seen elsewhere, in fact all of the behavior &quot;in the middle&quot; between the two regimes. Because you&#x27;ve got this considerable mixing of the two states, often &quot;zooming in&quot; is the same as, say, adjusting the proportion of liquid to gas -- so since it all happens in the same space, you look for these &quot;scale invariant&quot; theories that are the same upon zooming in. Those theories then can&#x27;t depend on too much particulars, but just depend on various symmetries, so they become &quot;universal&quot;. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_exponent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_exponent</a> .<p>Random matrix theory is similar, but for a different reason. The issue is, if you have a very complicated system that you can represent as a huge matrix, often the eigenvalues of the matrix tell you something concrete and physical. The example given above was the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian matrix in quantum mechanics, which gives you an &quot;energy spectrum&quot; (discrete energies that the system can be at, so that it can e.g. absorb a photon of energy B - A to transition from a state of energy A to one of energy B).<p>Why would a Hamiltonian be random? You have to imagine a big molecule with lots of parts, not entirely under the control of the experimentalist. Maybe you&#x27;ve got a carbon nanotube hanging over a trench that you&#x27;ve etched under it, but the etching has caused other atoms to be stuck to the tube in unpredictable ways, and maybe the &quot;islands&quot; on either side couple to the nanotube in complicated ways.<p>Wigner discovered that very often these random variations break the symmetry between certain levels, so that where you once had 3 states at the same energy, now it&#x27;s like those &quot;energy eigenvalues&quot; have &quot;repelled&quot; each other. He realized that the right way to start to think of the problem involved taking a matrix and adding random elements to it; this led to a nice set of models where you take it to the extreme and just randomize the entire matrix and look at its eigenvalue &quot;density&quot; rather than the exact levels. Wigner in particular discovered that this density function tends to look like a semicircle.<p>The essential similarity between these two is, you get to some point where &quot;there&#x27;s nothing more to say&quot;. With random matrices, when you specify how you&#x27;re building the matrix and what sorts of properties it has to have, then you get the eigenvalue spectrum, and there&#x27;s no other details to fixate upon. Similarly when you have a phase transition, the &quot;we&#x27;re taking on all the states in between gas and liquid&quot; status of what you&#x27;re doing means that the particulars of those states cannot matter. So in both cases it becomes just, &quot;what&#x27;s the configuration, what symmetries does it have&quot; that determines how macroscopic parameters (whether critical exponents or eigenvalue densities) ultimately behave.",1424971127

Rather, getting more or better output per labour hour.<p>Then, how did you know where to focus effort to improve? And that you&#x27;ve increased productivity?

The buyer posts how much he is willing to pay, and if I like what I see, I make the deal. If I don&#x27;t, I wait and hope the price goes up to something that matches my expectations.

This is certainly very practical advice, but it requires that I&#x27;m disciplined enough to go to sleep earlier the preceding night. That&#x27;s difficult but certainly possible.<p>Then work late and sleep in :-) I can&#x27;t do a lick of useful work before 10 (which isn&#x27;t great, since my job starts at 8:30), but I can cram 2-3 hours of good stuff in after my kids go to bed every night. Try different times to see when you&#x27;re at your best. It&#x27;s worth it to feel like you&#x27;re making progress on something awesome.<p>And I&#x27;ve got to echo seiji - just get your product out there as quickly as you can. Let your coworkers look at it. Send it around. It may be that no-one wants to use it in its present form, but just looking at what you&#x27;re doing may shake loose ideas and directions for the project that never occurred to you. Getting outsiders looking at your work is the difference between building something neat and building something great.",1424970268

And don&#x27;t feel bad about doing it. They will squeal a bit, but it is just business at the end of the day. And yes, do job hop from time to time or else your pay will stagnate.

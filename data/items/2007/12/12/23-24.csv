That guy (Conru) is pretty damned impressive, as getting acquired in the adult online business is very rare.  (Of course, it sounds like he sold at a significant discount.  The article indicates revenues of $340M in 2007...which either means they have an awful lot of expenses, or Penthouse got a great deal.)",1197502685

88913,comment,88233,88397,0,0,jraines,,,"You are correct about this.  Without getting into probabilities of the different outcomes resulting from action or non-action on climate change, I'd recommend the video someone posted lower down in this thread.<p>The weight given to an outcome in considering it in decision making would be the probability x magnitude (+ or -).  So on your drive home the risk of death might not affect your decision to make the drive, if you had to drive across Johannesburg or Kuala Lumpar, you might consider taking a cab.<p>So even while the probability that the Country A would survive a nuclear first strike with the capability to retaliate was quite low -- the magnitude of the outcome from its doing so was enough to dissuade Country B from taking that chance.<p>To the other commenter below -- just google 'prisoner's dilemma' or 'Nash equilibrium' for some sources to get you started on game theory.<p>Note: I'm not claiming to be an expert on game theory by any means.  I'm recounting the Mutually Assured Destruction example from an economics class's subsection on game theory and would be happy if someone wanted to prove me wrong or elaborate on the subject.",1197502331
88912,comment,88898,88898,0,0,dood,,,"There is an accelerating flood of niche social news sites; it seems more likely to me that in a few years there will be a huge number of these kind of sites (and many platforms to let you make your own), which in aggregate will probably follow a power-law distribution of user populations. <p>Recommendations is a good idea (never figured out why it doesn't work at reddit), but only for the 'fat head' of the curve, for the long tail the problem almost takes care of itself. Also, better categorisation would be useful, and would help with recommendations too.",1197502318

88908,comment,88898,88898,0,0,brk,,,"Interesting.  You could almost s/reddit/digg/g and get the same article.<p>IMO, part of the downside of the whole ""Web 2.0"" social-whatever type sites these days is that they're so easy to create.  Digg.  Reddit.  Mixx.  Etcc.  Why fix the broken one, when we can build a new one over a weekend (plus pizza and beer).<p>As the author outlined, they go through a standard-ish 4-step program as a sort of half-life dying off (at least as far as the hard-core geek users are concerned).<p>I postulate that you can't fix Reddit or Digg, and Mixx will be broken soon too.  These sites start out by attracting the leading-edge hacker techie types.  The ones who understand about a product being in beta (and feel a sense of elitism for knowing about it early on), they will report bugs to you (often with a 9 paragraph writeup of how to reproduce the bug(s)).  They will submit good content, and comment on articles, and vote, etc.  But they won't click on ads, or do other things that inch the site toward profitability.<p>So, there is no choice but to cast a wider net, gather in a lower-level audience.  The folks that haven't yet seen a cat with a lime peel on its head (at least we're not getting pancake bunny anymore) flock to the site.  With the masses comes the material that the tech crowd doesn't really care for.<p>news.YC might be the exception, if only because it's more hyper-topical, and it doesn't seem to be concerned with making money (I think news.YC is more of a flytrap for potential investees).<p>So, enjoy Digg and Reddit while they're young, hold on as long as you can through the growth phase, and then bid them farewell.<p>Maybe they will one day manage to recover.  Maybe we'll read about their recovery here.  Or on Slashdot...",1197501305

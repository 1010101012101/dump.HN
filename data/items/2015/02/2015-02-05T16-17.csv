He says the focus should be on scarcity because if it&#x27;s on creation, and if it&#x27;s applied in a consistent and non-arbitrary way, life becomes impossible, as &quot;as every conceivable use of property, every single action, would be bound to infringe upon one of the millions of past, accreted IP rights.&quot;<p>He actually has almost six pages explaining the problem with the creation-based IP rights, so saying that he &quot;simply asserts&quot; is just incorrect.<p><i>His scarcity argument is itself flawed: he focuses on the fact that copies of an intangible good are not scarce, and glosses over the fact the originals definitely are.</i><p>That&#x27;s because the scarcity of the originals is irrelevant to whether the copies should be considered property, any more than it makes me the owner of the light that comes from my light bulb.<p>The scarcity of the originals is only relevant vis-a-vis the use of the originals.",1423155581

You are right that overall structural performance is governed more by geometry than by material strength (resisting moment is m^4 (area times quadratic distance of center of mass), although there are gotchas like lateral torsional buckling, which require bracing) the main problem with aluminium is that cyclical tensile loading leads to material fatigue with a effective material strength of 0%, while other metals can be counted on for at least 50% strength.",1423155532

9004277,comment,8979873,8979873,0,0,vram22,,,"A book by Jon Bentley [1], &quot;Writing Efficient Programs&quot;, is very good for this area. It is out of print, probably, was written many years ago, but IMO is still likely to be very useful for a _wide_ range (not all) of performance issues.<p>This is because he approaches the problem both somewhat scientifically, as well as gives many rules of optimization that can be applied in various common situations. Lots of code examples in a language similar to (or actually) Pascal (forget which, read it some years ago), but that should not be a problem for any competent programmer. Many real life war stories of performance tuning throughout the book. In some of his examples he manages to improve some initial code (e.g. the travelling salesman problem) by one or more orders of magnitude (1 order being 10X), via repeated application of various performance rules to succeeding versions of the same code, optimized by one rule at a time. One of his war stories is about a team that optimized a quicksort (?) algorithm on a supercomputer by either 100,000 times or 1 million times (for speed) over the initial version, by working at several levels of the stack, including from algorithms through code down to hardware. Great story. At the end of the book he also gives all the rules or techniques again in a summary form (each rule is illustrated with one or more case studies in the body of the book), along with guidelines on when and when not to apply each. You might be able to get a used copy of the book on Amazon even though it is out of print.<p>Code hoisting, common sub-expression elimination, loop unrolling (with a good binary search example from Knuth), trading space for time and vice versa, using interpreters (to save space - he gives an example of someone who wrote an interpreter for an interpreter in a space-constrained old IBM machine environment, resulting in huge saving of space) - those are some of his techniques / war stories that I remember off the top of my head. Really worth reading, IMO.<p>He is also the author of Programming Pearls and More Programming Pearls - also pretty good books.<p>I just looked up his Wikipedia page again:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley</a><p>and saw these excerpts (among other stuff):<p>Jon Louis Bentley (born February 20, 1953 in Long Beach, California)[1] is a researcher in the field of computer science. He is credited with the invention of the k-d tree.
...
After receiving his Ph.D., he joined the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University as an assistant professor of computer science and mathematics.
...
At CMU, his students included Brian Reid, John Ousterhout (inventor of Tcl/Tk), Jeff Eppinger, Joshua Bloch, and James Gosling (inventor of Java), and he was one of Charles Leiserson&#x27;s advisors. Later, Bentley moved to Bell Laboratories.
...
He wrote the Programming Pearls column for the Communications of the ACM magazine, and later collected the articles into two books of the same name.
...
Bentley received the Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Excellence in Programming award in 2004.",1423155307

9004259,comment,9003819,9004074,0,0,jerf,,,"This conference is more likely to take you farther away from that goal than get closer. The foundational reason [1] that components are not interoperable is that they function in different guarantee regimes. A pure language can not simply &quot;interoperate&quot; with code that expects to mutate. Yes, the pure language can wrap around the mutation-based code, but it will forever have an impedance mismatch.<p>You can&#x27;t trivially interoperate with languages that have different async/sync &quot;colors&quot;, per the recent discussion: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8984648"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8984648</a> . And the discussion is good, because everything else that people mention as other things they thought the post was getting at are also examples of places where the code can&#x27;t just trivially interop.<p>And I say this will likely take you farther away than closer because right now research tends to be focused on how to use colors more effectively, and how to use more colors in code rather than less. All this mitigates pretty strongly against cross-language interoperability. At least, against interoperability beyond what we have now, which I assume that you are not satisfied by.<p>A lot of code today is &quot;interoperable&quot; because a lot of languages inherit the drab gray of C. For all the apparent differences between Python, Perl, Ruby, Lua, and C, in the end they are all languages of a very similar color. Python, Perl, Ruby, and Lua amount to programming in C where every line is a complicated function call instead of a simple C statement, but you&#x27;re still fundamentally in C. This has provided an illusion that interoperability is either somehow &quot;easy&quot; or something that could be improved, but as we move away from C&#x27;s drab gray, interoperability is going to get worse, not better.<p>Perhaps someday if we settle on a particular rainbow, some form of code that can be sufficiently accurately labeled with its colors could be interoperable, but we&#x27;re going to farther from that goal before we get closer.<p>[1]: I say this is the &quot;foundational reason&quot; because it&#x27;s the fundamental one that can&#x27;t be fixed by &quot;just trying harder&quot;. There are also incidental reasons that often depend on exactly where in the lifecycle of the language C-interop was considered (compare Lua with Python, for instance), and accidents of history that persist because there&#x27;s no point fixing them because the fundamental problem will remain.",1423155214

9004241,comment,8984648,8987998,0,0,drostie,,,"This has been a fascinating read, but I worry that there&#x27;s too much pressure in the paper to view all of these different approaches as somehow &quot;solving the same problem&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure they do.<p>There is this &quot;whoops, my state updated out from under me&quot; concurrency problem. To steal a metaphor from physics, the problem is that we expect the spacetime to be &quot;locally flat&quot; but to curve at long scales -- similarly we expect the state to somehow be locally private but globally we discover it&#x27;s shared. The multiple timelines (of operations in various threads) contain updates to the shared state which are noncommutative; when we synchronize we try to throw up these big walls, global across all timelines, across which operations cannot pass.<p>Glitch&#x27;s approach is to break these threads into commutative-and-noncommutative parts (fixed-points and events). So the focus is not actually on the fixed-points; they can be parallelized without fear because the operations on the state commute. The focus is instead on the events. And there it&#x27;s not clear that the events solve the concurrency problem at all. (Please don&#x27;t take that as a criticism; I don&#x27;t think you were trying to solve this problem. Your approach reminds me a little of Sussman&#x27;s propagators, and definitely it has some nice implications for live-coding.)<p>Concurrent revisions are a more direct response. The basic insight is that no matter what, &quot;there is one authoritative timeline, let&#x27;s call it the consumer-timeline, which is how all of these noncommutative events from multiple timelines will <i>actually</i> be ordered.&quot; Given that insight, and the need for the state to look locally-private, these explicit joins are an obvious solution. The joins look a little jarring because in the spacetime analogy we&#x27;re talking about a &#x27;piecewise-smooth&#x27; function, so there&#x27;s a sort of derivative-discontinuity happening here.<p>What would be really interesting is if the shared commutative operations of Glitch could change &quot;piecewise smooth&quot; to &quot;smooth&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think these ideas have that power.",1423155146

That &quot;shl $0x3,%r10&quot; multiplies the pointer in <i>register</i> r10 by 8 (2^3). So looks like JVM computes the base pointer to an object to a register (r10 in this case) and uses relative addressing from it.<p>Here&#x27;s example of using x86 indirect addressing mode to multiply the pointer by 8:<p><a href=""http://shipilev.net/blog/2014/safe-public-construction/steady.perfasm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shipilev.net/blog/2014/safe-public-construction/stead...</a><p><pre><code>  0x00007fc7b4971644: mov    0xc(%r12,%r11,8),%r10d  ;*getfield instance

In this case effective address for the load from heap is r12 + r11 * 8. Register r12 probably represents heap base pointer or similar in this case - I&#x27;m not sure.<p>16-bit would be significantly slower, but for entirely other reasons. Also, you could have at most 512 kB heap with 8 byte address alignment...<p>The issue with 64-bit pointers is that Java (and JVM) is a <i>very</i> pointer happy language, so the cost is significantly more than for pretty much any other language I can think of.

In the conventional lightweight steel alloys, the B2 intermetallics make the alloy brittle (so they don&#x27;t work harden very well), so in the past researchers optimized their alloys to avoid forming these intermetallics [0]. The nickel promotes the nucleation of the intermetallic particles during heat treatment [1], so that you get a more-or-less uniform distribution of many nanocrystalline B2 particles, instead of a smaller number of larger or more clustered B2 domains. The small B2 particles contribute to strain hardening by pinning dislocation motion, without reducing the ductility of the alloy.<p>From the Nature letter:<p>[0]: &quot;One of the general concepts employed until now in the alloy design of Fe-Al-Mn-C-based, high-aluminium, low-density steel has been the suppression of âbrittleâ intermetallic compound formation by stabilizing the âductileâ austenite matrix.&quot;<p>[1]: &quot;To expand the stability domain of B2 above the recrystallization temperature (normally, 800â900 Â°C) of deformed austenite, the alloying recipe of an austenitic low-density steel was modified by adding 5 weight per cent nickel (Ni), which is one of the most effective elements for forming B2 with aluminium.&quot;",1423154662

I know there are valid technical reasons why this isn&#x27;t solved yet, but to me it&#x27;s <i>unacceptable</i> that an IDE for a <i>statically typed</i> language gives spurious compilation errors: after all, compile-time errors are the main tool a statically typed language gives us. It&#x27;s the one feature that absolutely <i>must</i> work correctly.<p>- Even trivial autocomplete randomly stops working for Scala-IDE. This may be related to the spurious compilation errors.<p>I&#x27;ve been told the unofficial recommendation from the Scala community is to disable incremental compilation in the IDE and compile with SBT. Consider what this says about the maturity of current IDEs.",1423152881

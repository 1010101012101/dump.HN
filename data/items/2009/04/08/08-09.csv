552461,comment,552234,552425,0,0,Confusion,,,"I'm not sure what you are referring to, but if it is to my assertion that 'capitalism is a force of nature', then I advise you to read Marx. He already understood that capitalism is almost unavoidable in trading systems. It is an emergent phenomenon, like avalanches are emergent phenomena of the combination of snowfall, mountains and gravity.",1239180549

By only taking courses you know you can ace, you get the best GPA.  Taking courses in subjects you're interested in learning more about is suicide if all you care about is grades.",1239180252

I don't think so. Disrupting, and potentially bankrupting, hundreds of businesses... that sounds more like somewhere in the hundreds of millions, or potentially low billions.<p>Importantly, the US govt now needs to convince the rest of the world that this will never happen again. We've got servers hosted in the US. Should we move them? Are we safe from this kind of indiscriminate abuse of force?",1239180042

552445,comment,552112,552112,0,0,markessien,,,"I think you made a mistake here. Twitter names are not the same as domain names because the amount of info they contain will always be limited by design. But you've elevated them into the main namespace and diluted your core offering, in a manner that is unclear to new users.<p>It's a good idea to have twitter names, I just think that the position on the page of the names is bad - they should have been on a different page. I also think you should have gone with long domains also like I suggested last time.",1239178948
552444,comment,552429,552429,0,0,blasdel,,,"How nice of you to sort your idealism in order of plausibility:<p>1. Desktop Notifications: Terrific idea, and going to take a longass time to happen in a unified way. Already getting implemented via XMPP, perhaps browsers will just end up including an XMPP client where you can add to the roster from the DOM (pending confirmation). If this ends up happening via Twitter instead, there is no hope for this world.<p>2. Native Menus: a thoroughly mediocre idea -- for starters your webapps should not have fucking desktop-style menus! Furthermore how would you implement File-Edit-View on a mac? If you really need a dropdown, <select> is right fucking there. The only redeeming native-ui feature I can think of would be the ability to add to the browser's context menu, but that would be ripe for abuse if it was even close to useful enough.<p>3. <i>MICROPAYMENTS</i>: The single shittiest idea in the history of the web, and it's never going to fucking go away. Fucklers will continue to tilt at this windmill forever, and will always fail. There is far more terrific content available that I want to peruse than I will ever have time for, <i>and I'm a guy that spends every waking moment reading</i>. I'm serious, I often read well over 1M words a week (though I haven't instrumented in over a year), almost exclusively on the web, though in college I got 100+ books a year through ILL. There is just too much out there to be nickel & dimed.",1239178890

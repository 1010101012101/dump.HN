Doing that proof will fail. So, it is not necessary to look outside of the module to notice that something is wrong.<p>Of course, if `len` were public, that would be a different story. Unsafety doesn&#x27;t pollute beyond module boundaries <i>if all the extra invariants are about private fields</i>.",1452520780

I always wanted to expand the possibilities of Filter Forge&#x27;s nodal language, but until I met Haskell I didn&#x27;t know how to do that. And now, after trying Haskell, it&#x27;s simply impossible for me to think in terms of non-general, domain specific visual languages. The Haskell paradigm lends itself very well to a visual syntax, but there&#x27;s a lot of problems to be solved, and that will be an excellent challenge for me in the coming years.<p>Despite looking complete, it&#x27;s really, really far from that. There are serious conceptual problems that remain unresolved yet. We do have a visual tool for constructing and typechecking programs, but it’s not yet ready for any release, even an as-is alpha.

Functional programming really deserves wider adoption, and if our research can help that, I’d be very proud. Also, open-sourcing this may bring a lot of benefits to our commercial product, because it will allow us to access the global talent pool of functional programmers, who, collectively, have vastly more expertise than all our developers combined. I also think that many of these programmers are in academia, and would welcome a visual tool that could help them teach functional programming to their students.<p>On the other hand, we, as a company, have absolutely no experience in starting and maintaining open-source projects, and we have no idea how to do that properly, and what resources will it require from us.

If you go to a university and ask a 2nd year student what he thinks about that topic he will tell you exactly that: Read some guide about how to do good usability and then just implement it that way. I think you need to have experienced that, putting a lot of energy into making a usable tool and then having users running into such kind of errors that you haven&#x27;t been able to forsee yourself. Only then can you understand that it&#x27;s not about not getting the guide but that the underlying problems that result in bad usability often are in other areas (like not enough testing, like not looking into the libraries one uses, like not fixing bugs in a way that improves the bug&#x27;s situation as well as the corresponding error messages). It is less about &#x27;what to implement&#x27; (clear to most devs) it is more about &#x27;how to implement it&#x27; (often completely ignored topic).<p>In that regard I hope I can make clear why it is not necessarily rude to tell someone that they haven&#x27;t made the experience. I have certain assumptions about climbing mountains, but I have never done that so quite a few of these assumptions will be wrong or not about the actual points you have to deal with while climbing. I need to be aware of that, though. Otherwise I will a) think that I know everything there is to know about that topic and b) I will think I can give advice to other people how they should do it.",1452519865

Look at the rocket equation. You have to achieve a given delta-v to get into orbit. That drives the required mass ratio of the rocket. Getting up to 500 mph or whatever a B-52 can do basically has negligible impact on the required delta-v, so the require rocket size is no smaller.<p>SCRAMJETS are interesting because they can get up to a significant fraction of the required delta-v while in air-breathing mode. They can do that because unlike a traditional jet engine, they don&#x27;t have to slow air down to subsonic speeds for combustion. That&#x27;s what drives the maximum speed of traditional jet engines.<p>Edit: saw your other response. Delta-v is still an issue for suborbital trajectories. Hitting 100 km altitude requires a speed of about 3,200 mph. If you&#x27;ve got a subsonic air breathing stage, you&#x27;re still not getting much benefit. The big benefit of SCRAMJETS for suborbital flight is that they can hit the required speeds in air-breathing mode the whole way. No need to carry around heavy oxidizer.",1452518854

Even if for some reason you dislike them because they&#x27;re privately owned, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that that&#x27;s where people are. If you want to reach people, you want to be where they are.<p>Facebook&#x27;s objective is total control of all communication and it will stubbornly refuse to allow the migration of its data off platform. It will fight tooth and nail to prevent any other competing alternatives for social communication (such as open ones like email) from being seen as viable. Frankly, that&#x27;s a business risk for us all, because it moves control of communication into the hands of a third party. By coming down hard in support of them you are doing an important part of their marketing dirty work.<p>The net benefit for consumers is unclear.

10880562,comment,10877205,10877205,0,0,muzani,,,"First, let&#x27;s define value vs price. Price is how much the &quot;valuation&quot; is, exit price, maybe even cash flow.<p>Value is how much wealth it creates.<p>PG wrote a lot on this:\n<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a><p>Basically build something really valuable, then figure out how to make money from it. Different things have different value.<p>For example, Google is something extremely valuable, but they charge a tiny amount compared to the value they provide. Twitter and Facebook create a lot of wealth too. Even though they seem like toys, they&#x27;re powerful and influential media sources.<p>What about Wikipedia?<p>Peter Thiel brought up this idea of X% of Y wealth. Something can create 5 billion dollars of wealth, but doesn&#x27;t monetize well. Examples are Wikipedia and a lot of scientific research jobs.<p>Something very valuable can be bought for cheap. Something can be overpriced and become a &quot;unicorn&quot; without creating that much wealth too.<p>How much money people have also defines its price. If two $50B companies want to buy out a company, it can be sold very expensive. But if the only acquirers are $10M companies, it&#x27;s going to sell at a few millions max, even if it&#x27;s the same thing.<p>Acquiring is often used as a way to hire. If something like Facebook dumps $1B on building a messenger, they may not succeed. And then something like WhatsApp comes up and threatens their billion dollar baby. So it makes sense to acquire early to cut out the threat, even at a premium.<p>There&#x27;s also localization to deal with. Let&#x27;s say you want an e-commerce company in Indonesia, a huge and lucrative market. Logistics is very crude, laws are complicated, and there&#x27;s a lot of corruption and bribery to be paid where an American wouldn&#x27;t even know where to expect. Starting one is extremely risky and difficult. Nobody wants to hire 300 people in a month.<p>This is where it makes sense to acquire at a premium.<p>The reverse goes for talent. Generally companies in Indonesia could not find the same level of talent, because the brilliant people have moved to Sydney, Silicon Valley, and so on. If tech was a key component in their dominance, it&#x27;s easier to just buy an Australian company than deal with recruiting locals or starting a company in a tech hub.<p>Ego of the acquirer also plays a big factor. Some people just have a lot of money and are in a saturated market where they can&#x27;t reinvest it in themselves. Usually telcos. They want to dump it into something that makes money, like logistics or e-commerce or SaaS. They usually overestimate their ability and underestimate the difficulty of the task, so they won&#x27;t pay very much to acquire.<p>Finally, the price of a company goes way up if it can monopolize an industry. This is why Facebook and Twitter is worth do damn much. Nobody will go to another microblogging site if they don&#x27;t have to. Interestingly, the Chinese have their own versions, which are just as rich.<p>In general,\n1. Do important things\n2. Do difficult things\n3. Do things rich people can&#x27;t do\n4.

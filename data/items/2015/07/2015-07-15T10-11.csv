So many stories. He had plenty of cash, but drove to chat with strangers and because he couldn&#x27;t stand doing nothing.<p>- we got picked up in Duxton Hill in Singapore by a chap in his 60s, whose tone was a lot calmer and more attentive than your average &quot;so where you from-aaaah?&quot; happy taxi uncle. He made two fortunes from nothing, one per Asian boom, then retired and travelled the world with his wife for a decade. He got very bored of the luxury life, and also took up driving to meet new people and collect stories about humans. Singapore being great for this.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of occasions where, if you spend a bit of attention on the driver, you unearth either life stories worth preserving and thinking about, glimpses of a completely different world, or just fun stories where you wonder how much was made up.<p>I learnt a lot about his community in a 25 minute ride with an Indonesian driver having his 8th kid (all boys, amazingly) and working Uber in his spare time from working on oil rigs. A Polish man gave me a glimpse of the harsh life as a low-earning immigrant in a major European city, their main preoccupation in life seemed to be which alcohol to buy that was the cheapest yet still relatively drinkable. A driver was missing a couple fingers and complained about how Africans and Pakistans slept 6-aside in the cabin he used to have to himself in the &quot;golden days&quot; of the merchant navy (I never got the story about the fingers). He also had 6 wives in as many cities (none the one he lived in now).<p>I&#x27;m going to miss the human drivers.",1436957746

And there are no namespaces in HTML. I assume there never been any in 2002, but cannot swear on that.<p>2) CSS selector &quot;ns\:elem&quot; has nothing to do with namespaces, it is just selector looking for <ns:elem>s &#x27;tagname&#x27;. It works in HTML, and that&#x27;s what page actually shows. Try this:<p><pre><code>    data:text/html,<style>a\:\:\:{color:red}</style><a:::>foo</a:::>

3) Even if it was served as application/xhtml+xml, it would be:
3a) invalid: ex3 namespace is not declared;
3b) if fixed, then without applied style: SGML comment around CSS content would hide it from parser (or at least it does something like this in my test).<p>4) @namespace declarations in CSS must be &quot;on the top&quot; (after @charset and @imports, IIRC), not after rules, so that one declaration in the test is ignored.<p>5) Test4 has a typo: element name in html is `text`, but CSS selector looks for `test`.<p>I&#x27;m not sure all those remarks would make sense back  in &#x27;02 context, but if it was as misleading as it seems to me, it is quite sad how many people has been possibly confused by that, considering it is fourth verbatim Google result for &quot;CSS namespaces&quot;: <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=css+namespaces&tbs=li:1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=css+namespaces&tbs=li:1</a>",1436957472

More specifically, they&#x27;ll gobble up the smaller debt-ridden players as they collapse, accumulating vast resources for pennies on the dollar.<p>If someone like EOG tips over, a major like Exxon will scoop them up in the same way. Exxon would love to continue boosting its domestic holdings (after making a few big bakken acquisitions previously). Exxon for example has managed to drop its bakken production costs by 25% in less than five years.<p>Indeed, this process will lower the cost level US oil can be produced at even further. When the debt heavy players collapse, their existing property and assets will be liquidated for cheap, bringing down the cost for the acquirer - they won&#x27;t have to pay a premium for the assets. Debt makes the net operational costs higher; if you wipe it out in bankruptcies, the total industry production costs will fall proportionally.<p>Simultaneously, the producers are getting a lot more production per rig.

9890631,comment,9889582,9889582,0,0,marktangotango,,,">> The next reason is readability. COBOL is known as a &quot;verbose&quot; language, especially when it&#x27;s compared to a very terse language like C++. From a debugging standpoint, COBOL can be like reading a novel: In fact, I&#x27;d almost bet that, with a few variables thrown in, you could get arbitrary chapters from Game of Thrones to compile. Of course, all your favorite functions would die depressing, lonely deaths, but still…<p>In a way, this verbosity of which he speaks is the antithesis to the current &#x27;Learn to Code&#x27; fad.  And COBOL is a perfect example of a language that was intended to be so easy and intuitive to read and write, business people could do it (as it was promoted in the early years).  COBOL has sections, paragraphs, and sentences, verbs and variables are nouns.  Control flow is either via goto or &#x27;perform&#x27;ing paragraphs or sections.<p>Awesome in theory, for simple programs, the idea that anyone can write/read it may even be true.  But the devil has always been in the details. Logic in the perform/goto world quickly spirals out of control/comprehension, and for any non trivial COBOL application, there are multitudes of programs, flat files, indexed files, etc.<p>Not to mention the complexity of batch cobol (if you haven&#x27;t lived the horror of mainframe JCL, I envy you) and wiring together green screens in the CICS environment are all very involved, the definition of platform specific.<p>>>The first reason is employability. As noted, there are still plenty of companies running applications built on COBOL. And not all of those applications are archaic: Since 2002, COBOL has had an object-oriented framework.<p>And most of them have off shored most or all of their development.  One prominent local employer of COBOL programmers has a skeleton crew of COBOL developers after once employing thousands.  Additionally, I&#x27;d have to see some stats that anyone has upgraded to the 2002 standard to believe anyone is actually using object oriented COBOL in production.<p>Having said all that, COBOL was designed in a time of scarce resources and does make excellent use of system resources.  COBOL is close to the metal in a way that C is not;  COBOL is more like verbose assembler than C.  In COBOL all storage is statically allocated (memory allocation is possible, but not typical), and there is no call stack.  This mean COBOL programs never experience stack overflow exceptions, out of memory errors, buffer overflows.  Characteristics that make it &#x27;safe&#x27; from a security and multi tenancy perspective.",1436957275

It was fun to talk a bit with a few of the students, but I understood they wouldn&#x27;t hear it from me.  No, they&#x27;ll have to learn for themselves about the merits and tradeoffs of the old ways vs. the contemporary.<p>In programming as in all other arts, it&#x27;s good once in a while to revisit the trails our forbears traversed.

I liked it because I have never done this, and don&#x27;t recall working with any code that does. Most I&#x27;ve seen is unary operators having no space, e.g., x + y * -z.  (Though it&#x27;s always possible I&#x27;m misremembering, of course. Naturally, good programmers know to just ignore the spaces, in case they&#x27;re misleading.)<p>As time goes on, I imagine more and more text editors will format your code in a fixed way, making this sort of thing impractical anyway. Not just automatic indentation, I mean, but adding spaces in around operators and ensuring brackets are in the desired place and removing blank lines and so on.<p>GFA BASIC did this sort of thing on the Atari ST in the early 1990s, as did Visual BASIC, I think, in a few years later. Visual Studio has done this for C# since VS2008, more recent versions of Visual Studio will do this for C/C++ too, and there&#x27;s a long tradition of command line-driven formatters for C-like languages that you could also use. Go&#x27;s large - but not comprehensive - collection of features beginning with `g&#x27; includes gofmt, and I&#x27;ve no doubt Java IDEs will do this sort of thing for you too. And this autoformatting trend is bound to continue, because... well, why wouldn&#x27;t it? But it does mean - if it&#x27;s to be done properly, and in some way that won&#x27;t mean you have to reach for regular expressions to search for even the simplest snippet - that you can&#x27;t leave spacing decisions up to the programmer.",1436956676

The fastest implementations can be computing 16-24 blocks in parallel efficiently with AVX2. That&#x27;s 1.5kB of random data generated at once.

9890547,comment,9889598,9890367,0,0,vacri,,,"> <i>he not expecting something from his passengers</i><p>That the author is passing judgement on the non-talkers shows that he is expecting something from them. Like when he talks of his Combat Infantry Badge, and the only two options available are &#x27;not notice&#x27; or &#x27;notice and not care&#x27;. Plenty of people would notice and <i>care a lot</i>, but not want to get into a discussion that they think would lead to an argument. He&#x27;s basically expecting to get his ego soothed with the medal.<p>It&#x27;s a well-written piece, but he is projecting a lot of motivation onto people that doesn&#x27;t necessarily exist. For example, when I catch a cab, I don&#x27;t like to talk to the driver. It&#x27;s not because I think they&#x27;re a robot or the &#x27;hired help&#x27; or beneath me or whatever. It&#x27;s because I loathe small talk, and most cab conversations are exactly the same. There&#x27;s also a fair chance of getting into a conversation with a passionate bigot, which is never fun. The last taxi I had included a generally one-sided conversation where the driver kept trying to suggest-sell a brothel visit to me. Frankly, cab conversations are just not that interesting. Bit of an aside there, but I would guess a lot of people feel the same.",1436955218

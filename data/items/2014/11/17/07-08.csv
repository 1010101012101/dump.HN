Twelve weeks (480 hours) for $1,000,000 with a bonafide rockstar to get your concept not only up and running but well designed to be carried forward.</i><p>Given that<p>(a) most start-ups fail,<p>(b) the reason for failure is very rarely due to some irreversible technical error in the early stages of development,<p>(c) the kind of quality a really good developer can offer is much more valuable later, when you&#x27;ve thrown out the initial junk implementation that got you some customers and need higher quality to start scaling up/out,<p>(d) you&#x27;d need serious outside investment to be able to afford even one person at that rate, and<p>(e) there are plenty of smart people who could and would produce a useful baseline product for a typical start-up in 12 weeks for a lot less than a million bucks,<p>I suspect you are being highly optimistic about the size of that market.<p><i>Do you guys think people would pay that? If no, how much do you think people would spend?</i><p>I know they wouldn&#x27;t. Most bootstrapped start-ups have enough trouble keeping the power on for the first three months, and no start-up with experienced investors is going to take that kind of proposition seriously. Why do you think most start-ups are so keen to offer long-term, success-based compensation for employees who work crazy hours rather than offering real money at market rates for normal working days, and why do you think so many competent developers now insist on market rates and normal working days anyway?<p>If you&#x27;re a freelancer/contractor/consultant type then taking on start-ups as clients is like being a small business trying to sell to students: they want the moon on a stick, but most of them have no money.",1416211053

That would give the NSA valuable information for its so-called active defense system, which uses a combination of automated sensors and algorithms to detect malware or signs of an imminent attack and take action against them. One system, called Turmoil, detects traffic that might pose a threat. Then, another automated system called Turbine decides whether to allow the traffic to pass or to block it. Turbine can also select from a number of offensive software programs and hacking techniques that a human operator can use to disable the source of the malicious traffic.&quot;<p>But if you followed all the news since Snowden appeared, you&#x27;d know that the TURMOIL is simply the NSA&#x27;s global passive internet (and more!) monitoring system and the TURBINE one cog of the global active &quot;attack on the internet&quot; one.<p><a href=""https://robert.sesek.com/2014/9/unraveling_nsa_s_turbulence_programs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://robert.sesek.com/2014/9/unraveling_nsa_s_turbulence_...</a><p>&quot;TURMOIL is a “high-speed passive collection systems intercept [for] foreign target satellite, microwave, and cable communications as they transit the globe&quot;<p>&quot;The TURBINE system “provides centralized automated command/control of a large network of active implants”&quot;",1416211017

8617259,comment,8616952,8617235,0,0,forrestthewoods,,,"I didn&#x27;t understand consulting until a post on HN awhile back. It was a friendly guy who liked to hangout and chat with fellow devs. While visiting a city, Chicago I believe, he met up with coffee with a guy possibly also from HN. They talked, went back to the office, and he talked with another employee for awhile. The guy in question I believe had a background in SEO so he just kinda shared what he knew for 2 or 3 hours. Then they shook hands and went their separate ways.<p>A few weeks later he e-mailed back asking how much he would have paid if that friendly chat with an official consulting job. The answer was around $10,000. Yes it was only 2-3 hours of time, but built upon thousands of hours of experience. And the changes they could immediately implement would generate more than $10k in increased revenue so it would easily be worth it.<p>My point here is that it doesn&#x27;t matter jack shit how many hours are spent on a project or how cheaply it could be done. What&#x27;s infinitely more important is how much money can be made. If you can get more money out than you put in and putting more money in means you get more out then you put as much in as you can afford. Now for someone to plop down a million bucks on three months worth of work means they&#x27;d have to be unusually confident in a project&#x27;s chances of success. So that number I gave is pretty high. However paying big money to a seasoned vet to get the ball rolling makes an unbelievable amount of sense.",1416210875

8617244,comment,8616952,8616952,0,0,scottru,,,"Boy. As someone who actually runs a contracting + project agency, that looks to be of an approximately similar size as 10x (at least before this was published), this was lifting-cars-painful to read - not just because they have PR and I don&#x27;t, but because they (Solomon and Blumberg) _are the inefficiencies they are pretending to eliminate_.<p>Let&#x27;s take a few parts of the article:<p>>>&quot;The three partners have separate roles. Blumberg handles his and Solomon’s eleven remaining music and entertainment clients, and takes care of back-office matters: “Accounting, invoicing, collection, payouts. Everything that’s the bane of most people’s existence.” Guvench vets new talent. Potential clients have to fill out a questionnaire that one programmer compared to “the most complicated dating Web site ever.” Then Guvench and Solomon conduct interviews, to screen for communication skills. (I heard one potential client say, during a meeting in Solomon’s office, “We don’t want people who just write code and drool.”) Guvench also does code reviews—testing Web sites that aspiring clients have built, and reviewing the programs they’ve written.&quot;<p>So...\n--Blumberg isn&#x27;t working on the business at all;\n--Solomon&#x27;s work isn&#x27;t even described (except &quot;conducting interviews for communication skills&quot;).<p>So there&#x27;s one person, Guvench, an ex-engineer, who&#x27;s actually doing the technical vetting - i.e. 100% of the value so far is coming from one guy.<p>OK, then maybe the others are selling? Nope.<p>>>&quot;10x technologists are working with a variety of customers: Live Nation, a virtual-reality startup, and an N.B.A. player who has an idea for a social-messaging app. Solomon admitted, however, that this list is somewhat random—it consists mostly of people who found 10x through Google, or whom he or his clients know personally. He has hired a salesman, to pitch 10x to companies.&quot;<p>OK, so you&#x27;re closing PR-driven leads and your friends in the entertainment business? That&#x27;s your sales pipeline?<p>I know a number of agencies with two or three partners running the organization. I don&#x27;t know a single one of those where there isn&#x27;t somebody pounding the pavement, hustling, finding clients - and who know the difference between a long-term partner and a sports star with an &quot;idea for a social-messaging app.&quot; (We _all_ hear about those.)<p>The other value they&#x27;re talking about is in the negotiation process. Hey, I&#x27;m totally willing to believe that a many-year entertainment agent is a better negotiator than I am, at least in the first-principles department. But this is not some magic skill in what is generally a well-defined and competitive market, and of course you&#x27;re better at it when you deeply understand the technology and market, the BATNA for the client, etc. Those of us who actually understand the very small markets that one job description might meet are, in fact, pretty darned good at it too. For that matter, I&#x27;ve never told an engineer that you should work with us because we can get you a better deal than you can get for yourself, and if you&#x27;re dealing with a client who understands the market (which said NBA player may not), that&#x27;s pure hokum. (P.S. plenty of people on HN provide that coaching for free all day long.)<p>It&#x27;s ok that the author doesn&#x27;t really understand this market, and so the competitors she mentions aren&#x27;t really competitors at all - they&#x27;re all focused on full-time hiring. I guess it&#x27;s also OK that the New Yorker&#x27;s fact-checking department didn&#x27;t discover that there&#x27;s no such programming language as &quot;THP&quot; - that should be &quot;PHP.&quot; (Maybe it&#x27;s just a typo.)<p>But to let the reader believe that this approach represents the best this market has to offer - well, I guess that&#x27;s just really, really great PR. Back to work.<p>(Added later: I realized I commented on these folks 1.5 years ago at <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5527610"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5527610</a>.

The gender wage gap is perhaps the most stark example of this, but we see it, starkly, along many other demographic slices as well.<p>2) With respect to Chris Fry&#x27;s comments - I was actually <i>in Twitter&#x27;s eng org</i> when Chris raised the internal engineering referral bonus from 2.5k to 10k because the company wasn&#x27;t getting the volume of quality people it wanted. Chris is a really great guy, but I find his point about &quot;[at] Twitter, you get the best résumés on your desk already [via recruiting department, referrals, etc]&quot; somewhat misleading - there&#x27;s no way he would have raised the referral bonus as sharply as he did if he really felt that.

8617210,comment,8617006,8617006,0,0,csallen,,,"Interesting post. I&#x27;ve been using Ember on lots of projects for about a year and a half now, and I think it&#x27;s great. What this post really hits on, however, is the fact that Ember has quite a high learning curve.<p>After many years of developing SPAs using plain JS/jQuery, the benefits that a framework like Ember could provide were immediately clear to me. As a result, I was willing to push through this curve and subsequently reap the many rewards. For someone like the OP, however, who doesn&#x27;t seem to have built many ambitious SPAs and for whom building a traditional server-driven web app is an option, I can understand why dealing with Ember&#x27;s learning curve just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.<p>For those seriously interested in trying Ember, I would advise you not to make the mistake of confusing Ember&#x27;s somewhat steep learning curve with the quality of the framework itself.<p>Thoughts:<p>> 1. Silent Errors.<p>These can definitely be annoying and difficult to debug, especially if you&#x27;re newish to Ember.<p>> 2. Deep linking - unreliable.<p>This is probably because you&#x27;re not handling your route setup properly. I ran into lots of issues with this when I was learning Ember, and although the guides do a better job explaining how this works nowadays, I do agree with you that it&#x27;d be nice if there were more real-world coding examples on the web.<p>It&#x27;s important to be aware that the &quot;model&quot; hook in your routes isn&#x27;t always called. When you use the {{#link-to}} helper in your templates or the `transitionTo` method in your routes, you pass in the model directly and the model hook is skipped. However when navigating directly to the URL, the route&#x27;s model hook is called and is expected to resolve the model using the params from the URL.<p>There are also a few common gotchas that involve dealing with nested routes, but I&#x27;d have to look at your code to see what exactly is causing your routing issues.<p>> 3. Few libraries<p>If you&#x27;re using Ember Data (which hasn&#x27;t hit 1.0 yet), I could see pagination being somewhat of a pain in the ass. Still, I&#x27;m using Ember Data on a couple of large projects right now, and I was able to get pagination working fine in a couple of days.<p>If you&#x27;re not using Ember Data, pagination shouldn&#x27;t be harder with Ember than it is with plain JS+jQuery.<p>> 4. Few code examples / resources<p>I agree with you here. There are some good open source Ember apps that you can learn from, but definitely not enough simple code examples online. This is one of the reasons that the learning curve is so high.<p>> 5. Slower development<p>Learning something new is almost always going to be slower than going with what you know. This is especially true of Ember, which the team very accurately bills as &quot;a framework for creating <i>ambitious</i> web applications&quot; (emphasis theirs). Ember is often overkill for a lot of the apps that people need to build. However, if you&#x27;re building something ambitious, Ember will save you time and headache in the long run. And once you get familiar with it, you&#x27;ll be pretty speedy.<p>> 6. Added layers and complexity<p>I think your diagram comparing a Rails+Ember stack to a Rails+jQuery stack is totally misleading. You&#x27;ve simply taken everything in Ember and squished it into &quot;Javascript/jQuery&quot;. If you&#x27;re writing a very simple front-end app or a complex app composed of terrible jQuery spaghetti code then yeah, I guess it&#x27;s an accurate diagram. But if your front-end app is actually complex and well-written, then you&#x27;re going to have to spend a considerable amount of time implementing some form of glue to handing routing, templating, model state, etc on the front-end. Ember does that for you.<p>> 7. It restricted our design<p>Ember shouldn&#x27;t limit your design. It seems more likely to me that you guys were new and unsure of how to use Ember to accomplish a specific goal. That said, it&#x27;d be great to hear what kinds of snags you ran into, as these would probably make for some good code examples.<p>> 8. JavaScript<p>Ember is for developing applications in JavaScript. If you don&#x27;t like writing JavaScript-heavy apps, Ember is not for you. And that&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s very often the case that traditional server-centric applications are more than good enough for the task at hand. But when the situation calls for building a modern and ambitious single-page application, you&#x27;re stuck with JavaScript whether you like it or not, and I believe Ember is a great way to go.",1416209111

Times I&#x27;m not working, the effort of finding clients, etc. A standard job ensures that I have work next week (at least, in general) and comes with much longer lead-ins to periods that I&#x27;m not working for them, so I don&#x27;t have to charge (as much of) a regular employer to cover that situation.<p>2. Training and research. Keeping my skills up-to-date is something I&#x27;ve insisted from employers and just silently charge for when free lancing. Things like covering books or other training materials, sending me to conferences, etc. (In essence, you&#x27;re paying my 20% time and reading materials during the hours I bill for rather than during the hours I&#x27;m 20%-ing or reading.)<p>3. Most employers will provide some kind of benefits, which I have to cover personally and which cost more as a freelancer. This causes not only my hourly rate to sound higher, but the employer to actually have to pay more, because generally companies get discounts on group insurance. (I&#x27;m rolling the differences in dealing with taxes in here.)<p>4. This one varies by person, but I don&#x27;t charge for certain kinds of short communications, directly. My rule is generally that synchronous communications always cost money, and asynchronous communications with <15 min of my time invested don&#x27;t. I find it&#x27;s easier to just charge more on the core work hours than try to bill for the 30 ~2min emails you sent me over the course of the project.<p>Together, these make the free-lancing price sound higher, but actually comes out pretty close to what the cost-to-employer is, which is normally higher than the pay rate of the employee, once benefits, training, etc are factored in.",1416208226

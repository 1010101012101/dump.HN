I often hear people outside of the payments industry suggesting that interchange is broken, and I explain time and again that the amount of money they think is in play is not correct.  Take a look at <a href=""http://www.cardfellow.com/blog/credit-card-processing-fees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cardfellow.com/blog/credit-card-processing-fees/</a><p>If you look through that, you&#x27;ll see that the typical fees assessed by Visa and Mastercard are on the order of 25 basis points (a quarter of a percent).  The rest of that 2-3% is going to price transaction risk (in both directions).  No matter what you do in technology, if you&#x27;re not talking about a better risk management system, the most you&#x27;re going to be able to reduce interchange is about a quarter of a percent.

All the design considerations were for that. Talk of scaling is possible because having a sane distribution and concurrency model fell naturally out of a need for fault tolerance, being able to isolate execution paths from each other and resume them individually, etc. Scaling is what makes it &#x27;cool&#x27; right now, but it&#x27;s not where the real benefit to a webapp writer is initially, fault tolerance and concurrency are. Each request can be handled concurrently, while being isolated from all the rest, and a failure in one will generally have no effect on any of the others. That is awesome.<p>So, what are your requirements? Is one of them &quot;we need maximal uptime&quot;? Erlang/Elixir becomes a contender then. And if there&#x27;s ever an expectation of it needing to scale, it suddenly becomes a serious consideration. And if you want real time server pushes, Erlang/Elixir websocket support > Ruby&#x27;s, as others have indicated.

We are getting close to spending 20% of our GDP on healthcare; this is unsustainable.<p>That&#x27;s mostly a policy problem, not a technology problem.  Countries with single-payer healthcare spend massively less on it per % of GDP than the United States with its pro-profit healthcare system, and American doctors and healthcare corporations end up being fabulously more rich than in those countries. (And they still have private healthcare, like in Sweden, which competes with public healthcare organizations.) The other reason healthcare costs are getting higher is that people are getting older and thus more sick. That&#x27;s a generational bump, there&#x27;s very little we can do about that. Not that I&#x27;m opposing the types of ideas YC is after in this sector (preventative medicine and better sensing/monitoring), just that the premise is wrong that it&#x27;s a technological problem.<p>> At some point, we are going to have problems with food and water availability.<p>That&#x27;s because we dedicate most of our water and land resources to feeding cattle that we then eat.  Innovations that will have the most impact in that sector will involve weaning people from animal products. Stuff like Beyond Eggs and lab-grown meat.<p>> It’s not a secret that saving money is hard, and that people tend to be bad at doing it. The personal savings rate has largely been falling since the early 80s.<p>Sure, some super-low-cost index funds would help, but the main problem here is two-fold: 1) real incomes are stagnant, due to government policies favouring corporations and 2) government/pension funds are much better at providing good ROI on investment than individuals can. Once again policy change is much more likely to have a massive impact than trying to improve the individual worker&#x27;s investment returns.  Collect retirement contributions at the source, and have the best investors in the country manage them. Without taking a profit for themselves. It&#x27;s done elsewhere.",1410540493

Take flight, for example.  The glider had already been around for a substantial amount of time before the Wright brothers solved the &quot;control problem&quot; and the engine problem.  Those two problems were the only two left before powered flight was a reality, and the Wright brothers knew it.<p>For the singularity, on the other hand, there&#x27;s no clear laundry list of problems to solve in order to achieve it.  In fact, there&#x27;s no clear way to even define AI, or at least define it in a way that can be meaningfully translated into current technology.<p>Maybe the advent of quantum computing will change this.  I&#x27;ve suspected that AI is fundamentally impossible to implement on a Von Neumann architecture.  But this is very easy to say from the point of view of a society which hasn&#x27;t remotely discovered how to make AI work yet.  It&#x27;s similar in spirit to someone from the 1500s saying &quot;I think electricity is fundamentally impossible to harness, because there&#x27;s no proper medium to channel it&quot; even though metal was quite widespread at the time.  Humans just hadn&#x27;t figured out how to fashion wires yet.<p>The only thing we can say for certain is that we don&#x27;t know what we need to know in order to make the singularity a reality, let alone how long it will take.",1410540271

When Reader shut down clients had to be rewritten to work with the APIs of other RSS syncing services, services had to try and recreate the Reader API to ease migration and so on. All to arrive at a situation that isn&#x27;t much better than before - a bunch of clients hard coded to specific services that will have to be altered if those services go away. If Reader had been based on an open protocol then switching would have been trivial for everybody - you just point your client at the address of your new rss syncing server.<p>I want a world where switching between providers and clients is trivial(ish), like email, rss or the web itself, not a world like Google Reader where we are all hard coded into proprietary APIs that are one cost-cutting meeting away from being closed, leaving everybody with a lot of work to do to migrate.<p>I&#x27;m sure there is less opportunity to make money that way - you can&#x27;t lock people in as easily and so on.

If you ever take a tour of their Smyrna, TN plant you&#x27;ll see 1 line with a 9 or 10 Altimas interspersed with a Leaf every once in a while.

I think the description in the RFS is misguided:<p><i>&quot;We’re interested in helping developers create better software, faster. This includes new ways to write, understand, and collaborate on code, and the next generation of tools and infrastructure for delivering software continuously and reliably.&quot;</i><p>There&#x27;s a blind spot in prose like this that gets repeated all over the place in our community: it emphasizes writing over reading. I think we have to start with reading. My hypothesis is that we need to reform the representation of programs to address this use case: I download the sources for a tool I use, wanting to make a tweak. How can I orient myself and make a quick change in just one afternoon? This is hard today; it can take weeks or months to figure out the global organization of a codebase.<p>You can&#x27;t &quot;deliver software continuously and reliably&quot; until you rethink its underpinnings. Before the delivery problem there&#x27;s a <i>literacy</i> problem: we programmers prefer to write our own, or to wrap abstraction layers over the code of others, rather than first understanding what has come before.<p>More on my approach: <a href=""http://akkartik.name/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akkartik.name/about</a>",1410539131

In fact, they cast a shadow over it that will probably be harmful to it in the long run.<p>The Oculus acquisition by Facebook is possibly the worst thing that could have happened to VR. With the Rift, Oculus had the opportunity to chart a brand new low cost platform accessible to millions, and be the next IBM/Microsoft/Apple/etc of their day. They had everything going on for them: a founder who knows the field by heart, which allowed him to act the moment he saw the curves of &quot;state of the art&quot; and &quot;realistic potential for a consumer product&quot; intersect. A lucrative vertical (gaming) in which to get their v1 out. Industry titans believing in and joining the company.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but this reminds me of things like the Macintosh: the potential for brand new applications (with VR, &quot;computer assisted design&quot; takes on a whole new meaning). The potential to reach brand new audiences, and to make existing audiences experience thing they could have never experienced on traditional 2D screens.<p>But they went the acquisition route. Now they&#x27;re owned by Facebook, which means that everything they do has to go through all the motions that a large company has. They can&#x27;t do anything really risky, they can&#x27;t say &quot;fuck you&quot; to the status quo (because Facebook is the status quo). What are we going to see from Oculus? Locked-in app stores. Social networking bullcrap à la second life (pro tip: we&#x27;ve been trying to make &quot;social VR&quot; a thing since the very first days of the internet, and it&#x27;s always failed. The Palace (1995), Second Life (2003), etc. Every 10 years, like clockwork, someone tries it again and miserably fails. It makes for great science fiction -presumably why people are so intent on trying to make them happen in the first place- but in reality, it just doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>What will we see from Oculus? Most likely nothing ever really revolutionary. As far as gaming goes, we&#x27;ll probably see half-assed VR from Microsoft and Sony.<p>But as far as truly disruptive uses of VR goes?

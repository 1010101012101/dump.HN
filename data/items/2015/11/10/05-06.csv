Much of Europe shares a stronger belief in things like privacy and data protection than the US, and much of Europe has law in place to defend such things if the political will is there. Facebook can&#x27;t afford to face fines at significant multiples of that scale, and even if it could, it&#x27;s just asking for more severe action if it tries to force the issue.<p>The nightmare scenario for FB is probably losing access to parts of Europe for a while and as a result losing their critical mass of users so a rival social network can gain a foothold. With the digital native generation already far less attached to any one social network than their predecessors, that could become an existential threat to Facebook itself.

10537787,comment,10537268,10537268,0,0,Animats,,,"The problem with granular privileges is that programs want too many of them. See any Android flashlight app.  Theo is getting good results on tightening up the classic UNIX command line tools. Has he tried EMACS yet?<p>Also, a bigger problem than system calls is what parts of the file system the program can access. The concept that a program has all the privileges of its owner is the biggest single problem with permissions.<p>What might work is having a few general classes of programs, with appropriate restrictions.  Consider, for example, permission set &quot;game, single player&quot;:<p>- Can read anything in its install package.\n- Can read/write only to working directory associated with product/user combination.\n- Can go full screen, use audio output (not microphone), access mouse/touch, etc.<p>That seems reasonable. Angry Birds could run under those restrictions. For some games, the DRM won&#x27;t work, the anti-cheating won&#x27;t work, the ads won&#x27;t work, the in-game purchasing won&#x27;t work, the updater won&#x27;t work, and the social leader board won&#x27;t work. Still, it would be reasonable to require in an app store that games still work locked down to that level, even if some features are disabled.<p>One way an app store might make this work is that programs which require very limited permissions are easy to get into the store.  Programs which require extensive permissions go into the &quot;adults only&quot; section of the store, or have to go through a source code audit at the developer&#x27;s expense.",1447133883

6794313,comment,6792557,6794121,1,0,jzwinck,,,"I&#x27;ve travelled places where a single note is worth very little, so I needed to carry enough that if they were USD could be perhaps $8K.  Nobody seems to notice.<p>Money launderers can expect to pay at least 10% of face value in &quot;fees,&quot; perhaps up to 30%.  So if someone wants to launder $100K they might be willing to pay $20K to get it done.  Let&#x27;s divide the money among ten mules, and one of those gets caught or defects, losing $10K.  That leaves $10K total, $1K per mule, for &quot;travel expenses.&quot;  That&#x27;s enough for each to book plane tickets and take a few hundred back home.<p>For you and I, doing this would make no sense.  For plenty of people in the world, it could be the best career opportunity they have.  It&#x27;s not really clear to me how we can expect to stop this, apart from some more obvious markers in bills to show up in airport (and seaport) scanners (imagine embedding the Audi logo using metal film in every note--something like that).",1385391585

Read the letter, but make no mistake - the &quot;kind&quot; tone, especially when reminding how they did they best to get in touch, have meetings, help insuring compliance etc. is just a decoy. The truth is with &quot;must immediately discontinue marketing the PGS&quot;.<p>The gov wants to decide what&#x27;s best for the people. Should the people decide differently, using their wallets for example, this anomaly will be quashed.<p>This trend is especially strong in the medical field - gov approval required everywhere, then people wonder why medical things are so damn expansive.<p>I use 23andme and I&#x27;m happy with the information provided. I know it&#x27;s not reliable - it&#x27;s not a lab test anyone will use to base important decisions on, since it is not a full sequence of genes.<p>Yet, by being commercially available and easy to use, it is paving the way for commercial offers of full genome sequencing, which I damn well intend to use when they reach the $500 threshold.<p>However, gov actions like this one may very well make that impossible, making sure the only full genome sequencing offers there will be will be &quot;FDA cleared&quot; at a huge markup.<p>Suggestions to &quot;medical&quot; like companies - get out the gov eye.

Other countries have plenty of other crazy examples.<p>Someone else already pointed out that the city that houses the Dutch government has to different, equally valid names (and is also not the capital).<p>Not only are there addresses that lack street names, there are also addresses that lack house numbers or towns. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there are addresses that lack a zip/postal code in a country that normally uses them.<p>Then there&#x27;s reassigning addresses to other houses. The original building stays, but gets a new address. I&#x27;m a victim of this: a nearby swimming pool had my address until 15 years ago, but I still get a ton of their mail. Clearly in those 15 years, a lot of their contacts never bothered to update their address data. (Or maybe nobody expects a swimming pool to move.)<p>Edit: Beyond regular enclaves, there&#x27;s of course also the crazy of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog. It&#x27;s bits of Belgian enclaves in Netherland, some of which in turn contain Dutch enclaves. The country you&#x27;re in can change every other house. It&#x27;s possible all your neighbours live in a different country than you. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible a single house is in two different countries at the same time.

Where labor organizing risks torture and death, labor is cheap. Where labor organizing is a protected right, labor is relatively expensive.<p>This drives offshoring, as capital seeks production regimes where they can reduce the cost not just of wages, but of meeting environmental and safety standards. The naive capitalist then claims that the low ball cost of production in unsafe, toxic, politically repressive locations is the &quot;true&quot; cost of labor.\nUnions declined in power in the US as the economy moved away from manufacturing, and Reagan set the tone for service unions by firing striking air traffic controllers. By declaring open season on service workers unions, the capital backed Republican right made it clear they weren&#x27;t going to allow them the same sort of power industrial unions had in the mid 20th c.

It&#x27;s a logical fallacy because the logical argument is something that can be evaluated itself using logical reasoning.<p>But an expert witness does not present a logical argument that the jury can evaluate on its own merits. An expert witness presents an opinion and explains the evidence on which he relied to form that opinion. Facts that credit or discredit the witness help the jury determine whether to believe the opinion.<p>Incidentally, this is why the Federal Rules of Evidence are a better basis for internet arguments than the logical fallacies. These are rarely a matter of reasoning, but rather a matter of assessing the credibility of opinions. When you argue with someone about global warming, you&#x27;re not presenting logical arguments that can be evaluated standing alone. You&#x27;re arguing over which experts have more credible opinions and which sets of evidence you believe.",1385389738

Because Google, Microsoft, and Apple are actively selling billions of phones to customers. These customers, in turn, fuel the app market. This is not a &quot;bubble&quot;. These are consumers buying real products with real value, making companies real money. This isn&#x27;t a &quot;potential&quot; type of deal, this is happening and fuels some of the biggest companies.<p>Why are companies like Google making money through advertising and why are other sites using Google&#x27;s ad system to make a ton of cash too? Because there&#x27;s a market for it. People visit the internet, they see ads, they click on them and buy. Products and money gets exchanged. Amazon is in on the deal too because, guess what? People buy products from their site.<p>Now, why is Snapchat and Pinterest so highly valued when they make 0 revenue (albeit Pinterest having tried the affiliate game for a short amount of time)? Because of the existing markets and companies that can profit on their products. Pinterest is already trying out revenue models, how? Affiliate programs where people click on pretty pictures of something or the other, buy the product and pinterest makes cash. Nothing magical about it. Snapchat will be harder to monetize but could &quot;easily&quot; be purchased and used as yet another product for a company to capitalize on and get someone trapped in their ecosystem. See facebook about instagram. Same deal.<p>I&#x27;m not as familiar with the dot-com bubble as others but seeing revenue happening because people are moving to more of an online world rather than an offline one makes sense. People buying products, purchasing subscriptions to entertainment, buying subscriptions to useful utilities (eg. dropbox) makes sense. Ad companies fueling online advertising to get people to buy shit or subscribe, makes sense. Companies that profit on having users and engaging those users while advertising for companies that sell products, makes sense.",1385389666

This is because you can get new customers by improving the amount and quality of passive traffic you get, or by optimizing ads. This has a very good return on investment. But if a customer is somewhat unhappy and wants to leave but you persuade them to stay by building that &quot;one small feature&quot; they really wanted your return on investment is terrible. The feature will take several days to build and test and in exchange the customer will be happy for a only month or two after which they will again come with unreasonable demands.<p>Retaining a customer makes a lot of sense when you are a consulting shop where customers pay you for the work you do. In a SaaS world where a small percentage of the customers is already responsible for 80% of the support load trying to retain them is often just not worth it.<p>How much effort you should put in retaining a customer is a function of the cost to require new customers (CAC) and the LTV of the customer. And for SaaS focusing on customer acquisition works much better. Or to put it really simply: if your goal is to grow your SaaS business at 20% month over month the few customers that want to leave but could be persuaded to stay are simply a distraction.",1385388733

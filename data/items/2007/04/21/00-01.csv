I think it would be interesting to see a combination of these 'features' become a major player. <p>The goal is to get acquired and have a relatively big payday. But I think it's possible that a group of small players could merge and grow big enough to go public and compete with the big players. Of course the biggest challenge would be deciding who was 'in charge'. <p>If your company has 200,000 users and you can join forces with a few other similarly sized projects the new company would have more thinking and more manpower and resources and could benefit from some overlap in function and might be able to grow beyond some theshold that increases valuation multiples because of the viability of the company as an independent entity, and maybe even profitability. I think those things could very well outweigh the ease of fit of a feature. I'm sure it would depend on the buyers but it just might open doors to buyers that wouldn't be interested otherwise.

No, I didn't have any Myspace competitors in mind; I just assumed that something so badly designed must have at least one better-designed competitor. Maybe a bad assumption, in retrospect.

If you look at the memorial sites out there, they do cheapen it because they don't do a very good job. <p>The concept really isn't about the creation of an online memorial. It's really about providing a way for the LIVING people to come together, remember and talk. What's important here is the process of remembering and sharing with the intention of creating a memorial. My idea is simply a way to foster that connection. <p>I hope this frames it in a different light for you.\n",1177116897

It had the streaming audio, and the strong community features.  The initial communities grew up around the bands.  It wasn't completely random that Myspace was successful, they were providing a real and useful service.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=15036"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=15036</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=13112"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=13112</a>",1177114390

When I heard that he was going to be using YC News as a way to filter applicants I was more than a little put off until he clarified that.<p>I'm sure he's looking for intelligence, creativity, positivity, and passion.  High karma can reflect this, but it can also reflect an ability to be able to grind karma.<p>",1177114210

A higher offer rate among the YC top 30 could possibly have nothing to do with karma.<p>For example, versus the typical SFP applicant, the top 30 might:<p>- Spend more time online & therefore more time on their project<p>- Be more knowledgeable about the startup scene<p>- Have a better understanding of what YCombinator is looking for<p>- Etc.",1177113618

Emacs is an operating system that's built around editing text.  You start with a powerful editing paradigm and then apply it to pretty much anything you need to do as a programmer...it's about the best editing experience I've ever had.  My shell, source control, organiser, messaging, documentation, directory browsing, irc, document viewing etc is all done from within my text editor with all the awesome editing capability that 23 versions brings with it...also you can run vim from within emacs...",1280396916

1557079,comment,1556835,1556898,0,0,antileet,,,"After about four years of using Vim, I'm starting to see it's more of a paradigm (and almost a philosophy) built into an editor, rather than the editor itself. One thing many people complain about when they switch to Vim is editor's inability to understand their code unless they set up exuberant ctags, etc. Even then, the code completion (omnicomplete, supertab, etc) isn't to the grade of commercial IDEs.<p>It's only in the past few months, I've realized that every major IDE out there - from Visual Studio to Netbeans have plugins to enable vi-mode. Heck, many popular ones like QT Creator, KDevelop, MonoDevelop have Vi mode baked in right into the IDE itself, ensuring a high degree of integration. This gives you the best of all worlds - you get an intelligent, yet efficient editor.<p>A lot of projects exist, like VimWrapper[1], which enable application developers to embed Vim, or to emulate its functionality without excessive efforts and re-implementing the same code again and again. The Netbeans protocol in Vim is still used by editors like Pida to skillfully embed the entire editor, and there are great projects like Eclim, which prove the degree of integration Vim can have with its environment despite the governing policy discouraging interaction with external tools.<p>Personally, I switched to Emacs for two months (or tried) but found that with some tweaking, most of what can be accomplished by Emacs can be done using GVim. I feel, that with a little effort, the vi-emulation in Emacs itself can make for a better generic editing experience than either of the standard editors.",1280396769

I took the author's main points to be that (a) 37Signals's offerings are viewed by customers as investment opportunities instead of as consumable goods, and that (b) people are thus more willing to pay for 37Signals's stuff than for the mere ""consumption-services"" offered elsewhere. The author implies that this is the case <i>even if those consumption-services provide a lot of utility</i>.<p>Point being that in the author's mind, it's not that 37Signals is making great products while everyone else isn't. It's that 37Signals is making great products that are seen as productivity tools and hence as investments, rather than as simple absolute costs.",1280394367

A pediatrician says much the same about her patients.""<p>As it happens, my brother-in-law came into town today. At dinner, he asked my wife what it was like growing up in China during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution (she was born in 1951). She told him the hardest part was the hunger. Once she was caught digging up and eating a sweet potato from a field. Her teacher punished her by putting here on an even more reduced ration. This was only supposed to be for a few days, but the teacher forgot and she had reduced rations for the rest of the semester. It was only because a staff member asked about the punishment at the beginning of the next semester that the standard ration was reinstated.<p>She was just a small girl with ponytails.",1280394043

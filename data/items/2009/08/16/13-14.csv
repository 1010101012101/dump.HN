766097,comment,765840,765941,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yes, it's true -- people who are thinking of committing suicide are more likely to do so after hearing about someone else who commits suicide. (This is also true for other acts, like murder-suicides.) There's a lot of research on this.<p>But it doesn't necessarily follow that the right response is to try to cover up suicides. For one thing, people who are <i>at</i> Caltech are bound to hear of anyone who commits suicide at Caltech. For another, it's hard to cover up anything that happens to someone, particularly a young person, in the era of Facebook and Twitter. Third, counseling can actually work for those who <i>get</i> the counseling. Most suicidal people can be helped by one strategy or another: cognitive-behavioral therapy, antidepressant drugs... even just frank discussion can help. Remember, a large number of suicide attempts (in the USA, at any rate, and especially among women) aren't actually meant to succeed. Just because the phrase ""a cry for help"" is a hopeless cliche doesn't mean that most suicides are not, in fact, cries for help.<p>And, of course, even if some genius psychometrician crunched numbers on all the above scenarios and concluded that the best response to a suicide would be a coverup and the silent treatment... nobody would believe it, and the school would get <i>hammered</i>, in public and in court, for trying such a policy. After all, the same aspects of culture that recognize many suicide attempts as desperate last-ditch cries for help also recognize that the appropriate response of your friends and family is to... offer help.",1250430927

766091,comment,765990,766047,0,0,Maro,,,"I'm somewhat ""conflicted"" with regards to Susskind. I'm a physicist, but I don't know much about string theory or LQG. As a bystander to the ""Not Even Wrong"" debate, I agree with Smolin's points about falsification and predictions being an essential feature of a physical theory, thus, on a personal level, I took Smolin's side (').<p>Then, couple of months ago I found the Susskind lectures on iTunes, watched and enjoyed many of them. (They're aimed at a general engineering audience, but I still found portions such as General Relativity illuminating.) Susskind is clearly a physicist of the highest caliber, the last time I heard such first-class lectures was when I listened to the Feynman MP3s during my freshman year. So on one hand, if Susskind says these ideas have merit, they're probably worth taking a look at. On the other hand, there are so many other interesting areas (in physics and elsewhere) where I feel something tangible could come out of that I am still ignoring string theory for the most part. I should note that I'm not very representative in this regard, as Smolin notes, most theoretical physicists at top U.S. universities are string theorists. It's interesting that here in Hungary, while the graduate school offers some courses on string theory, I don't know anybody pursuing related research. Most theoretical/particle people are doing SM/QCD related stuff, which is clearly a cultural thing here.<p>(') In reality, falsifications and predictions are a tricky business in physics with people making implicit assumptions, circular logic, estimated error bars, etc. --- I think that non-physicists' view of this is similar to my view about police work based on CSI:NY.",1250430709

It has been about five decades since Einstein lived and perhaps the academical community is still accommodating to his theories. You have to know first what is, before going beyond to what else could be.<p>As for his suggestions and problem, I think society has already found the solution. Whenever you read of people who are considered to have made a great contribution to this world, you will notice that their parents are aristocrats, or business men, or judges, surgeons, rich people basically. The child of these people is free to spend their time as they wish, outside of the confinements of the current system and it is perhaps this freedom compounded with the networking and other means of influencing, which allows them to contribute so greatly.<p>The only way to open the door to more people is by paying scientists as much as footballers are paid. However, while a footballer peaks in his late 20s, a scientist peaks in his late 30s, so even this approach would perhaps not address the issue and lead to a world of pop science which seems to be flourishing somewhat currently.",1250430094

6529408,comment,6528969,6529326,11,0,mrmaddog,,,"Not exactly. I am a huge fan of code modularization, but what modularization offers you is the ability to decrease the exponent (i.e. to be devTime^1.01 instead of devTime^2). Some features though (including segment tuning, from the sound of it), will touch a ton of other features regardless of how well you modularize your code.<p>I work at a networking company (Arista), and a lot of the interesting problems come from this sort of interaction. Our  entire OS was built so an agent would be resilient to changes in another agent, and this modularization means there is very little &quot;spaghetti code&quot;. However, when you are building a feature (say, a new routing protocol), you have to be extremely conscious of how it interacts with everything else: various reliability features (i.e. Stateful switchovers), configuration features (saved configs, public APIs), resource contention (TCAM utilization), etc. etc. If that new routing protocol was the first thing we implemented on our switch, it would be a complete breeze. In the context of other features though, this becomes a more intensive project (though in codebases without proper modularization you&#x27;d find this task &quot;herculean&quot; as opposed to &quot;intensive&quot;).",1381431464

This company is not one of those. They have a small-scale prototype and are claiming a 60m wingspan (enormous), 65,000-feet-flight for 5 years. NASA among others haven&#x27;t gotten a month.

Are you implying that because businesses have a short-term approach to making money that therefore, the government is forced to give money to unproductive contractors? Are you saying that because &quot;the people&quot; don&#x27;t have a concept of &quot;public good&quot; that when the government bids something out they can&#x27;t help but use a bidding approach that virtually guarantees failure?<p>Vague platitudes about society at large aren&#x27;t crashing government projects. Society at large aren&#x27;t really involved in them, after all. Something specific between the interaction of the government and the government-chosen contractors is probably the problem.<p>In a way, you&#x27;re probably proving far more than you mean, accidentally; if the problem really <i>is</i> &quot;society at large&quot;, then there is no solution and these large projects can&#x27;t work, and therefore the most effective thing the government could possibly do is <i>stop trying</i> and wasting money.

Growing a new piece of technology with no customers to an evolved product that scales and has a growing engineering team behind it introduces lots of new issues that have to be dealt with. I&#x27;m not necessarily a process freak, but from my experience, having a few solid processes really goes a long way and should be put in place early. Especially revolving around communication of issues and development priorities. When there&#x27;s a major fire or conflict on teams, there&#x27;s a big microscope that should be looked through in order to add improvements that will help a company get past future stages of growth more smoothly.",1381431349

I consider that tiny in be grand scheme of things (so I use that term), certainly in comparison to Amazon itself, but I am a giant in comparison to most of the other people who will be looking at their service seriously (I feel like most people who reach my size prefer not to rely so much on third-party payment networks; in fact, I don&#x27;t even want to anymore, and am hoping to start doing direct credit card billing soon, ironically via PayPal Payments Pro, at which point Amazon is getting the axe).<p>But really, the most important points I made are very general: 1) this isn&#x27;t new, as they&#x27;ve been in the PayPal-competitor business since 2008, and 2) to the extent to which this is somehow a new launch for Amazon, it is demonstrative of a pattern wherein they keep releasing new payment services without showing how they are related to each other and without having any kind of feature parity: this isn&#x27;t a new service... this is a new feature of an existing service... and that&#x27;s exactly how companies like PayPal and Alipay both added it... years ago.",1381431348

He only had minimum experience in the distribution centers and never spent weeks and months out on the line. But Bezos laid out his argument on the whiteboard, and every stinking thing he put down was correct and true, Jones says. It would be easier to stomach if we could prove he was wrong, but we couldnt. That was a typical interaction with Jeff. He had this unbelievable ability to be incredibly intelligent about things he had nothing to do with, and he was totally ruthless about communicating it.</i><p>And from Steve&#x27;s second post:<p><i>Trust me folks, I saw this happen time and again, for years. Jeff Bezos has all these incredibly intelligent, experienced domain experts surrounding him at huge meetings, and on a daily basis he thinks of shit that they never saw coming. Its a guaranteed facepalm fest.</i><p>Steve&#x27;s posts give a much better account, though, since the control theory guy doesn&#x27;t say what the argument was about, and why Jeff was right. Steve goes on to desribe his presentation to Jeff on what an engineer should know, how he hacked the presentation to make it intersesting for Jeff by removing enough from the presentation that Jeff had to mentally fill in the gaps, and what Jeff pointed out that Steve didn&#x27;t add (machine learning or data mining).<p>A CEO that appears to know everything is a common theme in large founder-controlled companies:<p>Steve Jobs: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/eric-schmidt-on-steve-jobs-10062011.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/eric-schmidt-on-steve-j...</a><p>Bill Gates: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/06/16.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/06/16.html</a><p>Stephen Wolfram:  <a href=""http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/starting-long-term-company/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/starting-long-ter...</a> Start at &quot;I insist on really understanding everything.&quot; (Wolfram Research isn&#x27;t a large company but that appears to be partially by choice)<p>James J.

After they get over the sheer amusement of watching it fly, one of the first things they want to express is the potential for this thing to violate their privacy.

However, at later stages in the development you have to account for how different, already-written applications are loading their memory, and thus the feature needs handle far more edge cases than it would have if this was an earlier-implemented feature. I&#x27;m not saying the overall time to develop segment-tuning would be shorter, in the long run had it been developed first, but the perception of development-time for this feature would be shorter (since any segment tuning edge cases that you ran into while writing an application would be considered part of the app&#x27;s development time, not segment-tuning&#x27;s development time).<p>I&#x27;m sure that if Mr. Gates had implemented FAT at a later date, he would have needed a <i>much</i> longer plane ride.",1381429136

In response to this idiotic situation, contractors start bidding at crazy low rates on these things, say 40 bucks an hour, then actually make their money on changes. So it&#x27;s always in the contractors interest to capture and execute changes, while it&#x27;s the government is trying to get the world delivered to them on a platter for five bucks. People use the term &quot;perverse incentives&quot;, but this is like that taken to the next level. It&#x27;s a multi-layered thing. It&#x27;s total systemic failure. We&#x27;d call it systemic collapse, but the money keeps flowing in anyway, so that term isn&#x27;t applicable, although it certainly feels like it.<p>This kind of distrust doesn&#x27;t make for anything but a living hell for everybody, government employees and contractors alike. So, with tons of rules and structures in place, the way things really work is through relationships. People who are easy to get along with and helpful get more government work. Both sides of the fence can&#x27;t control the process, and nobody rocks the boat and everybody gets a piece of the pie. You end up from the government side with some sort of informal and unspoken version of <i>I don&#x27;t care if you make a lot of money, just make sure me and my friends look good</i> Also it&#x27;d be nice to pick up a little lucrative consulting work once I&#x27;ve put in my 20 and can start double-dipping.<p>Your average developer has absolutely no idea about this. If they&#x27;ve worked in IT in federal work, they probably have horror stories, but the more you see the worse it gets. Oddly enough, in the best cases you end up with people who really like working together, are motivated, but spend most of their time fighting a Sisyphean fight against the idiocy of the system.",1381429007

Instead of bottom up, employee-driven changes, it&#x27;s top down based strictly on metrics and the changes typically effected so that whoever&#x27;s currently in charge can say, &quot;I made <process> 10% more efficient by reducing the number of wasted <things>.&quot; Employees resist the changed processes/taskings because they fear a loss of employment, and are kept out of the loop when the changes are being devised. Federalized Agile would likely be similar.",1381428246

My understanding is that if you just support 8.3 names it&#x27;s unencumbered.<p>Edit with further detail: The thing that&#x27;s unique about LFN are the rename and delete behaviors.  Lots of filesystems support more than 8.3 or multiple names for files (hardlinks) but I don&#x27;t think any of them have alternate names for files that &quot;stick&quot; when you move them into another dir, or that behave somewhat cleanly when a non-LFN-aware OS does so.",1381428055

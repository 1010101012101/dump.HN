658015,comment,657870,657870,0,0,antiform,,,"The reason that short, frequent publishing is so pervasive on the web is that you have to compete with everything else on the internet that is shiny, flashing, and begging for your attention. I think that we, as humans, have a predilection to focus on real-time updates, on what's happening NOW. It is the only reason that I can possibly understand the success of things like Twitter or Facebook status updates.<p>Furthermore, there are so many benefits to publishing frequently that it's hard to argue against it. For instance, if you publish frequently, you will have a better Google ranking, be seen as an ""active"" member of the community, get more links on social news sites that link submissions to URLs, constantly show up in peoples' RSS readers, etc. Also, if you write a long, substantive article, many people will not take the time to read it. Most will just skim to see if there's anything interesting, and if they don't find anything, they will leave.<p>Also, if you want to make money on the Internet, it's something that you need to do daily, or at least very regularly. Dollars follows peoples' eyeballs, and peoples' eyeballs follow constantly updated content. I can't think of an example off the top of my head of a blogger, videoblogger, etc. making a living by posting infrequent posts but I can list a couple dozen people that make very good money with either gawker-like blogs on certain topics, a regularly updated promotional (video)blog, or through advertising dollars on popular YouTube channels.<p>I know in my rational mind that it is probably better to read content-rich articles on the web, but my reptilian mind is constantly drawn to the new, the hot, the now. Until somebody finds a solution, there will always be a short battle with myself every time I fire up Google reader or think of checking HN.",1245045041

While I do think being able to properly label adult content is important, its better achieved through a meta tag, the class attribute, or in the case of a link, the rel attribute.<p>With the HTML5 and XHTML movements a primary focus has been on eliminating non-semantic tags like div and span. Its a noble pursuit, but I think in the witch-hunt to eliminate general purpose, non-semantic tags a monster has been created. When all elements must be semantic, we need many more to achieve the same goals.<p>Microformats are an example of doing it the right way. Instead of creating new HTML elements to represent each concept, microformats use an existing, general purpose attribute (class) to convey meaning.<p>I'm all for adding new elements when they make sense, but a NSFW element feels like a step backwards.",1245044894

I could read <i>War And Peace</i>, but I would have no-one to talk about it with. But I know everyone else is reading what's new.<p>There are other ways to coordinate, though. Book clubs, for example, often pick non-new books to read. Maybe solutions should concentrate on the coordination problem.

There are several other forms that font-lock understands, including custom functions that do highlighting.<p>Emacs also has something called the ""syntax table"", which allows you to declare what comments and string literals look like.  Emacs can then use this information to syntax highlight those elements, and not do other syntax highlighting inside them.<p>cperl-mode uses this combination of features to correctly highlight nearly 99% of Perl constructions correctly.

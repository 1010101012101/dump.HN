I&#x27;ve only had time to skim so far, but it&#x27;s impressive.<p>I happen to be a physicist too, and my stance on climate change is identical to yours. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever have a climate model with detailed predictive ability: the system is too complex and the initial conditions too uncertain. But we really need to stop changing the composition of the atmosphere; mainly, we need to move quickly away from burning coal, for several reasons. I agree that we should do this through incentives and development of alternatives, not through a &quot;revolutionary&quot; approach.<p>It was refreshing to read something rational about climate. Everything I&#x27;ve seen lately (although this isn&#x27;t my field) is either &quot;we can&#x27;t predict climate so we should stop worrying and just keep burning coal&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s already too late because the models are true and we have to shut everything down now or we&#x27;re all going to die.&quot;<p>On your orbital simulations: you seem to be using physical units. Often people avoid some of the very big or small numbers by using, say, the Earth-Sun distance as the unit of length or the Earth mass as the  mass unit. Do you just prefer physical units, or are you doing this and I missed it? Either way, very interesting demonstration of the effect of the Moon on the Earth orbit - would not have guessed this result.<p>P.S.: Go gnuplot!",1423370651

By their reaction I&#x27;m certain that these ideas will be unpopular for the rest of our lifetime.<p>The best you can do is to keep preaching them if you believe in them. If the other person is a thinker, most people don&#x27;t want to be thinkers, you might try to pitch them post-scarcity economics or explain that historically people never worked as much as they do nowadays. Also explain that most human progress came from &#x27;play time&#x27; not &#x27;work time&#x27;.<p>You won&#x27;t change the world, just accept that, the world does not want to be changed. Most people invest a lot of effort in complying with the status quo. It takes generations to change this kind of social conventions.<p>Also,<p>&quot;Unpopular ideas can be silenced, and inconvenient facts kept dark, without the need for any official ban ... At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question... Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing, either in the popular press or in the highbrow periodicals ... If liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.&quot;\n-George Orwell",1423368466

You can then monkey-patch that into a class or do whatever other nefarious thing you were planning.<p>I agree it&#x27;s a somewhat confusing name, since interned symbols are the more familiar kind of symbol in other languages, especially in the modern era (older Lisps made more extensive use of uninterned symbols).",1423368446

Compressing the time scale to a single instant just shows the flexibility of language and the overlap of our concepts. My clothes dryer is reliable in the sense that I can disassemble it and replace the heat coils and bearings and belts. When repairs are finished it is the same clothes dryer. If I had purchased a new white good unit, it would be a different dryer and if it could not be repaired it would be less reliable than which could.<p>Because by reliability we imply use.

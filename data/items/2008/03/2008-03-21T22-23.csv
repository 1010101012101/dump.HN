If they were colluding instead of fighting then profit margins would be even higher than they are. But at current prices, customers are buying all the gasoline and diesel available so there is no pressure to cut prices.<p>The impact on poor people who live in suburban and rural areas is one of the problems with a carbon tax. But unfortunately in the long run those people are screwed anyway. Fossil fuels can't stay cheap forever, tax or no tax. Probably some of the tax revenues would have to go to subsidizing them through buying back inefficient vehicles, additional mass transit, housing vouchers near urban areas, etc.",1206140010

142889,comment,142610,142813,0,0,fendale,,,"Yes, but it gets protected automatically if you use the mentioned attr_protected or the accessible version.<p>Basic Rails code to update your own details on the 'view my details' screen is something like<p><pre><code>    def update_details
      @logged_in_user = User.find_by_id(session[:userid])
      @logged_in_user.update_attrs(params[:user])
      @logged_in_user.save 
    end
</code></pre>
Obviously you would never expose the :is_admin flag on the update_details screen, but a not even very cunning user could guess its there and manufacture up a post request containing the is_admin flag, setting it using the bulk assignment above.<p>Sticking in attr_protected :is_admin in your model means that ActiveRecord will just ignore that attribute if it is bulk assigned securing it with a single line of code.<p>Attr_accessible was new in Rails 2 (I think) - its says deny all BUT the ones listed - best way by far.",1206139895

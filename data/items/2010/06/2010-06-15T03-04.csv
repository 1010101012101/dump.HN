Let's say you receive a millirem by standing close to a nuclear power plant core. Then you eat a banana, which spends one day in your body before the potassium is excreted, giving your body one millirem of radiation in the process. What's the difference?<p>I'll agree for iodine ingestion however. They could consider the radiation emitted over a human lifetime to be fairer.",1276574379

Running your house like a pack of dogs (or frankly a boot camp) might not be the best way to raise children. You don't want to raise children that: 1) can't think for their own b/c they only know how to memorize/regurgitate or 2) will instantly rebel  and 'go wild' when control is released (i.e. university/college).<p>> <i>My father was the boss, it was an undebatable fact and I experienced very little drama in my childhood. I never got grounded, and I rarely got disciplined because if I ever did something wrong I simply had to be told not to do it again.</i><p>This evidence is just as anecdotal as the people that say, ""My computer runs Windows and I've never seen a BSOD so therefore anyone that experiences a BSOD must have been asking for it."" Also, read the comment (currently) above this thread that refers to further information that was cut from the final draft of the article at Alex's request. It adds more context to the story.<p>On the other hand, there is <i>some</i> evidence for having a strong father figure. e.g. Ted Nugent has stated that it was his up-bringing that kept him out of drugs and alcohol even while hanging out with notorious drug users like Jimi Hendrix. (Though many people might not see the 'Motor City Madman' as a role model to aspire too; I don't share a lot of his views on politics, etc)",1276574152

So, if the testosterone levels were a problem but didn't exceed natural levels (at any age), why were there problems?<p>Yes, you could have problems with a child with high testosterone levels, but the article also seems to be claiming everything else about the boy was developing at the same rate- that is to say, while chronologically he was one age, his body AND mind AND everything else were some other age, <i>but all the same age</i>.

He barely spoke to his father.</i><p>Down the road, Alex realized how blessed he was to have such great parents:<p><i>A strict vegan, Alex had just apprised me of new research on latent carcinogens in poultry as well as the news that he was to receive the award for the university’s Outstanding Computer Science Student of 2010.

I learned (in a virology class, but the principle applies to anything with a replicating genome) that a very good estimate of the combined resistance rate is simply the product of the separate resistance rates associated with each drug in isolation. I don't think this is commonly done with antibiotics yet, but perhaps someday this will become necessary.<p>I should also mention that when the selective pressure imposed by an antibiotic is removed, a population of resistant bacteria will invariably revert to a wild-type phenotype because of random drift (or loss of its resistance plasmid where applicable).

CS,EE,Chem Engg, Mechanical Engg PhD's are much more in demand than Marine Biology PhD's.
Thus when Eric Schmidt talks about lack of students it about these fields.<p>I can assure you that if you are from a top 30-40 university and have PhD in CS,EE,Chem Eng. or other hard core engineering you are near guaranteed a good job (unless you have messed up royally)<p>However if you are not from top 30-40 University or did your degree in Chemisty, Marine biology, Physics and or some esoteric branch of Maths you are less likely to get an industrial job. Also i sadly see a lot students working in 40+ ranked universities for a PhD E.g. Syracuse U. and future is really bleak for them.<p>Thus the issue here is grouping of all STEM PhD's together.
However if you are from top 40 Schools in resp engg fields then you dont have to worry as much. If you are not and study marine bio (It sounds cool subject) sadly your job prospects are restricted to Academia!",1276571779

I remember when I first starting using Linux, there would be one penguin for each processor core.  Booting it up for the first time on a dual xeon machine and seeing 8 of them, was kindof funny in a nerdy way.<p>Would this be different?  If there are 512 cores...would it show a penguin for each core?<p>Sorry, like I said, I haven't actually watched the boot process on a linux machine for quite some time, and now I'm a bit curious...<p>Sorry if this question is juvenile or stupid or something.",1276571565

All artists would earn at least 50% from their content versus only <= 20% at best. All sales would be royalty free and there is already a good team of artists who have ""signed up"" and some are currently generating content as I speak. From what I understand it would be just your typical upload/download gallery to start out with and there would be a filter for professional content. Later on it might expand into new territories. Other than this limited bit I don't know much.<p>So my question is 1) What would I be getting into here? 2) Roughly, how expensive is it to run a stock site from beginning to end? 3) What would you want to see in a future stock site (programmers and artists alike)?<p>Thanks for your time.",1276571200

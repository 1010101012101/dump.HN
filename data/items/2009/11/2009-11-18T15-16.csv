The ""free"" accounts are deployed to an Amazon EC2 instance.  The paid accounts are deployed to a dedicated server.  In the near future, Flooha users will have the ability to install on any cPanel or Plesk server (99% of the web hosts out there use these) or any LAMP server.<p><i>I didn't see any of those extensions available :-(</i><p>You can upload any extension you want!<p>The process is very simple.  Here are instructions from our wiki:  <a href=""http://wiki.flooha.com/index.php?title=How_to_upload_an_addon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.flooha.com/index.php?title=How_to_upload_an_addo...</a><p><i>Also if I select one of MediaWiki v1.14.0 or MediaWiki v1.15.1, choose ""Browse Addons"" and then follow the hint at the top of the page and click ""By app version"" and then finally press ""filter and sort"", I get an empty list. Do you have to actually do a build first?</i><p>No, you do not have to build it first.  The best option is the default, which shows you addons for all versions (1.14.0 & 1.15.1).  Most extensions are compatible with all versions the app.  When a user uploads an extension, they might choose to associate it with version 1.15.1, but that doesn't mean it isn't compatible with 1.14.0.  So, filtering by app version ensures you only see the version of that extension that is compatible with the app version you are building.  I hope that clears it up for you. If not, you can contact me on Google talk as user ""flooha"" or shoot me an email: matt [at] flooha.com<p>If more users start to use the system and upload addons, more addons will be available to everyone.  It's easy for 700 people to each upload one addon, but quite time consuming for one person to upload 700 addons.  If you need help uploading the addons (extensions) you want, let me know which ones and I can help.",1258559896

For the most part they work pretty well, and when we have problems with one we switch to the other.<p>The problem is that the whole setup is pretty ghetto.  We have a consumer grade router and switch splitting the T1 to about 8 of the 24 ethernet ports that are wired in the building.  We occasionally see dropped connections and other flakiness on the T1 which I attribute to either A) the crappy hardware or B) some of the wiring might be bad in the building.<p>We've always just muddled through this ourselves, but we're starting to see a little traction and we don't have time to screw around anymore.  We want to pay someone to come in for half a day, assess the situation, recommend a router purchase, wire up and test the rest of our ethernet ports.<p>Should be an easy job, but the question is how do you hire someone like this?

""It is thought transport providers, such as train, tube and bus companies, will lose the right to demand a hefty fee from companies such as independent travel websites and firms devising programs for mobile phones, who want to publish such information.""<p>The wording is a bit unclear, but it seems to suggest the UK Government will pressure transport companies to lower their license fees for data about public transport services.  That would be a bonanza for any number of exciting startups.<p>(For example, there's a journey planner website for trains across the country, but it doesn't know about other forms of transport.  In London there's a journey planner for all modes of transport, but it doesn't go outside London.  Bus routes, for example, are mostly available only as unscrapeable PDFs.

An example: I pay $50 to ship money between Japan and the US, which is fairly competitive for international wire transfers from first world financial institutions.  Wal-Mart wanted to offer financial services to Mexican immigrants to let them ship money between the US and Mexico.  They said ""Screw it: this is going to cost $2.99.  Until we find a way to lower the price.""  They impress me with their relentless, all-consuming, borglike quest for improved efficiency, which I think does wonderful things for poor people.  I wish all businesses I deal with had Wal-Mart forever nipping at their heels.  (For example, I wish they could bring that pricing pressure to bear on my behalf for financial services.)  I know, I know, I'm supposed to feel class-based superiority to their customers and pretend that their $12 China-made shirts are grossly inferior to my $100 China-made shirts... but I've never been good with that sort of mental gymnastics.<p>Oh, and one from the home team: I love Toyota.

You get an ""A"" for effort, but you're missing the point. Joining start-ups does not suck. Lemme 'splain.<p>I survived that whole dotcom boom watching all of my male internet buddies start, get hired at and then cash out of start-ups. As many times as I privately asked to be considered, I was denied. My male friends networked for jobs, got references. I asked for the same and got hems and haws and shufflings of feet. I had to marry one of them, just to get that opportunity. It worked: I've stayed with MTSO for 3 years -- longer than any place I've worked since I left high school. Sounds bitter, doesn't it?<p>The truth is, I never let myself be bitter. And I've always told the women who do whine to suck it up. Whining sets a bad example.<p>So let's review:<p>- I'm exceptionally motivated. You put yourself through college scrubbing toilets and see how motivated you are. So far there is nothing I've tried that, in time, I did not excel at. Pardon my hubris. But it's impossible to be at the top of a game you cannot play, right?<p>- I would have loved that job. I kept applying and kept getting turned down. The closest I could get was as a contractor, which is kinda like a temp who can script instead of type. Sun hired me to train full-time employees. Contracting  came to a swift end when I became pregnant. To quote, ""We think you should reconsider your fit within this organization."" You don't forget words like that.<p>- I used to program, decades ago. I quit, but I don't exactly remember why. It's a mystery, because coding does not feel like work, and I get paid for that, now. Instead, I spent those decades as a sysadmin. I have a lot of grey hair and innumerable scars on my arms and legs from running cable and shifting heavy equipment.<p>- I worked 100 hour weeks, anyway. Even now I try to cram work into every small time slice available (today, that meant coding while waiting for an x-ray appointment). I always was paid less than my male peers, so the threat of being paid next to nothing is meaningless to me. I wouldn't trade what I do now for anything short of ""independently wealthy."" What does crushing defeat really feel like? When a famous do-no-evil company interviews you and asks what your kids will do all day while you're at work. Or a recruiter mentions she hears your kids in the background and asks for reassurance that you can work 40 hours a week. That's the moment when it hits you that all the blood, sweat and tears that flowed from you while you were paying your dues count for nothing. A friend of mine quit the industry for two years to work as a roofer. He walked right back into a six-figure salary. Note that I've never had a six-figure salary, but I know what most of my old co-workers made then and make now.<p>- No, sir, the pinnacle of my career comes at the ripe old age of 40 when I really don't care if we ever cash out. I'm sure Tom does, but not me. Risk tolerance? All our eggs are in this one basket. Even though I know that, if something goes wrong, we can get ""regular jobs,"" this is just too much fun. Not in it for the money... in it for the bragging rights.<p>When I went back to work full-time, Tom didn't quite have a sense of what I was up against. Though I think he got an inkling when I was interviewed by someone who showed me a picture of his ass during the interview. Heck, I was even SURPRISED to find out that it was illegal for to be asked what my kids would be doing while I was at work. And I called that recruiter's boss -- a woman, also. She peed all over herself, verbally, apologizing.<p>Your ideas to make startups more palatable are not bad, but they are expensive. Startups need to run lean. And as for women, a lot of the time we're trying not to aggravate bias by whining. As my grandmother said, ""You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar."" Nobody likes a whiner. It's a dignity thing. But I don't have anything to lose. So if you want to hear more of the gory stories of my work experiences, feel free to track me down and email me.<p>Oh, and sorry for the really long response. It was a long post.",1266983541

1147197,comment,1147166,1147166,0,0,patio11,,,"Nginx runs all my Rails sites and will forever.  If you haven't tried it yet, I can't say enough good things about it.  It <i>never</i> breaks.  It has just absurdly good memory consumption, which is clutch when you're trying to run your site on a memory heavy platform like Rails on a VPS which is very memory constrained.<p>(By comparison, Apache is quite the memory hog and I still haven't figured out how to say the magic words to get it to not effectively crash my blog and every other site on the server if I burst to 10,000 visitors in an hour.  That is <i>not supposed to be a big number</i>.  Apache has 500 MB to play with and still can't keep up.)<p>I also find, and this might just be a matter of taste, that the configuration makes more sense to me than Apache configuration does.  This is funny because Apache configuration is obsessively well-documented and Nginx configuration is not.<p>Additionally, some easy-to-use features cover weak points in typical Rails (&etc) deployment scenarios.  The big one for me is file serving, since my website is essentially one big PDF printing press.  The simplest level (works for me, won't work for Facebook) is just having the file anywhere accessible on the disk and having the application put a special header on the response saying ""Hey, Nginx: give them this path."", then terminating Rails' involvement.  That frees up your Mongrel to start doing hard work again and greatly, greatly, GREATLY decreases the resources you need to stream your 5 MB PDF, 20 MB executable, etc to the user.<p>So it scales down, but does it scale up?  Ooooooooh yeah.  Impressively so.  See the tales of Wordpress deployment, where not a whole lot of Nginx gets hit with a year's worth of my traffic every couple of seconds and still keeps on trucking.",1266982982

1147193,comment,1146221,1146783,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"From <i>Rubbish! The Archaeology of Garbage</i> by Rathje and Murphy, a book which you have helpfully given me the chance to plug:<p>""The archaeologist C. W. Blegen, who dug into Bronze Age Troy during the 1950s, found that the floors of its buildings had periodically become so littered with animal bones and small artifacts that 'even the least squeamish household felt that something had to be done.' This was normally accomplished, Blegen discovered, 'not by sweeping out the offensive accumulation, but by bringing in a good supply of fresh clean clay and spreading it out thickly to cover the noxious deposit. In many a house, as demonstrated by the clearly marked stratification, this process was repeated time after time until the level of the floor rose so high that it was necessary to raise the roof and rebuild the doorway.'<p>""Eventually, of course, buildings had to be demolished altogether, the old mud-brick walls knocked in to serve as the foundations of new mud-brick buildings. Over time the ancient cities of the Middle East rose high above the surrounding plains on massive mounds, called <i>tells</i>, which contained the ascending remains of centuries, even millennia, of prior occupation. In 1973 Charles Gunnerson, a civil engineer with the U.S. Department of Commerce's Environmental Research Laboratories, calculated that the rate of elevation due to debris accumulation in Troy was about 4.7 feet per century. If the idea of a city rising above its gradually accumulating fill and debris at this rate seems extraordinary, recall... 'street level' on the island of Manhattan today is typically six to fifteen feet higher than it was when Peter Minuit lived there [circa 1600]; in some places it is as much as thirty feet higher. Nowadays, needless to say, the fill used in construction in Manhattan is not normally garbage, but Gunnerson calculated that if all of the garbage from Manhattan that is currently sent to Fresh Kills [landfill] and all the construction and demolition debris from Manhattan that is currently dumped at sea were instead spread out evenly over the island, the rate of accumulation per century would be exactly the same as that of ancient Troy.""<p>None of this surprises a Bostonian; most of modern Boston is built on fill:<p><a href=""http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/fa267/bos_fill2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/fa267/bos_fill2.html</a>",1266982906

1147155,comment,1146545,1147121,0,0,lsc,,,"Hm.  well, first, if you want to compare different cpu architectures, that's really hard, because the effectiveness varies massively by what sort of tasks are performed...  so this is a task that requires so much fudge factor I'd call it more marketing than engineering, and ignore it.<p>Hm.  But what If I mentioned the minimum and maximum?  I can do that...  so, for example, on a 256MiB VPS, you are probably on a server with 8 cores and 32GiB ram.   (now, personally, I steal 1 core and 1GiB ram for the dom0, but you could squeeze that some, though I wouldn't recommend giving the dom0 less than one core.)<p>so, uh, you have a total of 124 domains, right?  and 7 cores, so each domain gets, what, 5% or so of a core at minimum, and then 100% of the number of vcpus given at maximum.<p>now, if the provider was simply up front about how much ram they put on a box, the user can figure this all out for themselves (in a xen system /proc/cpuinfo will give you information about the real cpu)<p>But yes, this could be made much more clear.  But even so, it'd probably not result in anything that is usefully comparable to a dedicated server, and really, the performance bottleneck we usually see is disk;  if you use 2 or 4 spindles for those 124 accounts, well, disk sucks pretty badly for everyone.  But this is the nature of small VPSs.<p>(so really, giving you specs about my disks might be better;  or just making public graphs of CPU and Disk usage on servers.  But I have a hell of a time convincing people that anything but the CPU matters, so that might be a waste of time.)",1266981194

> On the plus side that feedback can be less biased.<p>But the cycle time is so slow. Feedback with a co-founder happens very quickly, and both parties are deeply involved and working on the venture.  This gives a level of detail and understanding that you can't really get from customers and friends.  That is not to say that customers and friends should not provide feedback; they should.  However, it is different.<p>This was the point of my last sentence: ""While you can get some feedback, the nature of the conversations changes (at least for me), and there are some things you don't really talk about to others.""  This refers to the kind of feedback you are talking about, and while it has value, it is not the same thing.<p>>>  When you are on your own it is much easier to go down the

Those disagreements are opportunities to get a better outcome for everyone.<p>There are multiple variables.

Re the request path, that was intentional: since the path will <i>always</i> be ""/"", I didn't see a good reason to explicitly print it; and instead just show the request method and protocol version. That said, I get your point: it's a bit surprising, so will consider modifying it.<p>As for how it's useful: Whatheaders.com is interesting and useful when you are working with some ""black box"" HTTP client, and which you cannot conveniently know what request headers it is sending.  In particular, mobile-device web browsers, which are wildly divergent, capricious, and undocumented in their behavior; sometimes the only way to know what they are doing is to measure it directly.  That's why I made it originally, in fact.<p>I imagine it would be similarly useful with any other kind  of proprietary HTTP or REST tool or library if you don't have access to the source, and need to know exactly what headers it's sending in order to troubleshoot, etc.  For something like Firefox with (e.g.) livehttpheaders installed, or standard vanilla web browsers like IE or Safari, IMO whatheaders.com isn't terribly interesting.<p>Be sure to read <a href=""http://whatheaders.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whatheaders.com/about/</a> for more details.",1266980736

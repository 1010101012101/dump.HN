5751301,comment,5750095,5750095,30,0,yaakov34,,,"I think that in their desire to explain this popularly, which is legitimate, they made a rather confused version of both the history and the mathematics. First, neither Weil nor Deligne are unheralded - they are about as famous and acknowledged as mathematicians can be, aside from a few universal geniuses such as Gauss and a few people who have solved a long-outstanding problem and were mentioned in the press a lot (e.g. Andrew Wiles). (Incidentally, Weil once joked that many generations from now, people will probably think that Andr Weil and Andrew Wiles, both professors from Princeton, were the same person).<p>Second, it's an exaggeration (to put it mildly) to say that Weil is the first one to think of a connection between numbers and geometry. I mean, this goes to Descartes at the latest. And such sophisticated tools as the fundamental group of a topological surface were introduced in the 19th century.<p>For anyone confused by the statement that the solutions to x^2+y^2=1 in complex numbers form a sphere: they obviously don't form a sphere in the usual sense, since the solutions are not bounded (since there is a root of every polynomial in complex numbers, you can find a corresponding y for every x, indeed usually two such y's). What's meant is that the Riemann surface defined by the graph of this function (i.e. y=sqrt(1-x^2), which is two-dimensional surface embedded into four-dimensional space, has genus 0, i.e. it is topologically equivalent to a sphere, which is to say it doesn't have any holes in it. I think you are supposed to prove that this is so by considering this surface on the complex plane minus the set [1,+inf], seeing that the function has two distinct continuous branches on the remaining set, each of which is equivalent to a sphere since it's a simple one-valued function over the complex plane, and then gluing the two spheres along the line [1,+inf] like you would glue two regular spheres along edges of cuts made in both. You end up with another sphere (from the point of view of topology).",1369234707

I think in my scenario, the problems have been compounded by an overall lax (lazy) coding style on the part of my predecessors, in that many of them were junior devs who virtually made-up their own coding styles. These devs treated whitespace like it cost money, and avoided any unrequired use of spaces, tabs, and newlines.<p>These types of conventions -- no curlies around simple blocks -- aren't too bad if a) your devs are adequately seasoned, and b) your devs believe in whitespace.<p>For instance, this isn't really so bad:<p><pre><code>    if (foo)\n      foo();\n    else\n      bar();\n</code></pre>\nHell, that's clean!<p>But it's stuff like this that causes issues:<p><pre><code>    if(foo)foo();\n    else bar();\n</code></pre>\nSometimes I'm lucky and find this:<p><pre><code>    if (foo)\n      foo();\n    else {\n      bar();\n      baz();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe best is abominations like this though; first, the sane formatting:<p><pre><code>    if (foo)\n      while (i++ < x)\n        foo(i);\n    else\n      bar();\n</code></pre>\nOr, as I have found it:<p><pre><code>    if(foo)while(i++<x)foo(i);\n    else bar();\n</code></pre>\nSeriously, that's enough for me to revoke commit privs.",1369234689

5751282,comment,5750489,5750489,6,0,beat,,,"My twin children spent seven years in Minnesota charter schools - one at one school, six at another, ultimately graduating high school. Overall, the experience was extremely positive. The reason is obvious to me... there is no single ""right"" way to educate a child. Every child is different, and has different needs. Techniques that work well for one student can work poorly for another, or even be counterproductive. Charters allow more technique flexibility and focus than mainstream schools.<p>The first charter my kids attended, in sixth grade, was awful for them. They were miserable and got bad grades. Does that mean it was a bad school? No, it's a great school! But it was a bad school <i>for my children</i>. The rigid, Catholic-like environment of that first school is great for regular kids who could use a more disciplined environment, but for neuroatypicals, it sucked.<p>The second school we tried was absolutely wonderful. It followed a project-based learning curriculum that gave children a lot of control over their own learning, but also demanded a lot of responsibility. My oddball children (and the herd of aspies, ADD cases, and queers that accompanied them) thrived in this environment. But frankly, I think it would be a bad school for most kids. It's too demanding.<p>Charters are in part about experimentation. And some experiments will fail. It's not a good idea to conduct large-scale, risky educational experiments on involuntary subjects - mainstream schools. But for parents and kids who CHOOSE to try new things, the opportunities are fantastic.<p>Sadly, most people's opinions of charters are knee-jerk political reflex, rationalized with ""results"" that have nothing to do with how parents or kids feel about their education.",1369234566

One of the more annoying things about people who talk too much about typography and other design topics is that they get locked into orthodoxies which are barely even opinion and certainly not even fact.<p>The classic example is Helvetica vs Arial. The first thing every designer learns about typography is that Arial is just an ugly copy of Helvetica and is to be avoided, but in fact, the difference between the two is so subtle that it really doesn't matter which you choose in most applications. In fact, when it comes to webpages, the fact that both of these fonts are being displayed on a computer screen means that pixelation will hide most of the differences most of the time so that they will really be  equivalent. People who see the difference between the two on a website and decide one is better are falling victim to a kind of placebo effect.<p>My favorite example of this was a blogger who was extolling the advantages of Helvetica over Arial one day and showed two bitmapped renderings of Helvetica and Arial back-to-back.

Before we ever saw him butcher a deer, he made sure that we tried (and enjoyed) fresh deer loin and deer heart (sounds gross, but smooth muscle is delicious if prepared correctly). He didn't tell us what it was at first, and he cooked it in a way that pretty much any self-respecting meat-eater would love.<p>It's kind of a tradition for the hunters in my hometown to cook up a fresh loin (and liver) they day they butcher a deer. Quite often that cut of meat never makes it into the fridge, and it's the best damn meal that animal will produce. Writing this it's hard not to salivate thinking about fresh loin sautéed in butter and garlic. Needless to say, after going through the process several times I went from being disgusted by the gutting, skinning, and butchering to being excited to participate and hungry for the results it would produce.<p>If I can have that drastic a change over one type of food, why can't I over another?",1369233948

For instance, America could be cropped and the player could then be tested at his/her ability to spot the different characteristics of each state.

Since it has all the hinting to ensure it displays nicely at small sizes, it's a best-of-both-worlds scenario. And Helvetica looks pretty good at large font-sizes, even on Windows systems (admittedly less smooth, but the readability concern goes away). There's no reason to stop using these, just play them to their strengths.<p>Likewise, Verdana and Georgia are terrible for headers. Not for any technical reason like hinting, but simply because they were designed to be extremely legible on computer monitors at small font sizes, at the expense of actually looking good when blown up.

The most used tool in my browser is Inspect Element to reset fonts on many blogs to the browser's default.<p>I can't disagree with his love for Georgia as a serif font, but even Times New Roman can be pretty (yes, pretty) if used correctly.

Some focus on the arts, others emphasize cultural heritage (there are multiple Hmong charter schools in the Twin Cities alone); some are vocational, others rigorously academic. As Rockoff puts it, asking whether a particular school is good based on test scores or college placement is in many cases the wrong question: “To extend the restaurant metaphor, some people like Italian, others like Thai food. Similarly, many [charter] schools focus on tested subjects, while others might emphasize creative writing or the arts.” Not every charter school is right for every kid.</i>",1369232618

I'd like it to be something users can configure at account creation time in various ways, ranging from SMS/call from to ""can't recover password"".

Ideally, as nice a webmail client as possible\n3) Encryption wherever possible.  The low hanging fruit is start-tls for SMTP and IMAP, and https for the webmail.  Storage encryption would be nice; could be ""encrypt mail to a public key as it arrives"". \n4) Support of S/MIME (and PGP, ideally) keys would be really nice; do some signature checking on the server side in the webmail ui?  Run a keyserver?  Issue s/mime identities to people who use accounts on your domain?

That said, with such a limited number and variety of instructions (Looks like a 12-step program with the opportunity for a single 4-step subroutine) I don't see much potential for teaching about abstraction and reuse, and I think children will reach the limits of the toy very quickly.<p>Given that you're already committed to putting this into production, are you actually looking for critical feedback or are you simply trying to raise awareness?<p>[1] <a href=""http://armorgames.com/play/2205/light-bot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://armorgames.com/play/2205/light-bot</a>",1369231608

Note that this is from merely an interested person's view, I'm not a kernel dev or anything.<p>Linux has to strike a balance between compatibility, stability and innovation.  The goal of Linux isn't ""OS innovation"", the kernel people would rather that innovation occur in userspace (at least from my reading of the tea leaves), and that is happening a lot.<p>However, Linux doesn't have the power to ""break out"" and try something radically different, as it has actual users with billions of dollars invested in Linux that rely on its stability and its compatibility with the hardware and software they use.<p>Symbian and QNX are not mainstream kernels, as they really only exist in embedded devices, and really only support ARM and a couple other architectures.<p>Minix, GNU/Hurd and the Microsoft research are just that - research.  No user base to speak of, no commercial uses, etc.<p>I think the most successful microkernel wasn't actually micro, but a hybrid - Windows NT.",1369231491

But the fact that they had done well by other measures could be explained if they had been lucky in the students they got in the lottery, which would also explain their doing well by a new measure.<p>The simplest way to solve this is to select schools by how well they did with one cohort, and analyze them by how well they do with another.  For instance you can select them based on performance during people who entered in even years on one exam, then analyze them by people who entered in odd years on the other exam.  Yes, this cuts your sample size in half.  But it avoids this particular bias.<p>(This does not, unfortunately, avoid the possible bias from getting lucky with who they hired as teachers.  Yes, the school may work.  But was it by design or chance?  The school will always think by design, but unless some charter school can start pumping out successful franchisees, it will be hard to find proof.)",1369231345

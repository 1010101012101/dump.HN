I notice that many comments here on HN could just as well be responding to the bare title alone, whether or not the participant has read the fine article. Until I can read the article (I can't so far after repeated attempts), I'll give some history of how the cholesterol hypothesis was developed.<p>Ancel Keys, a member of the Terman longitudinal study of high-IQ children and inventor of the K ration for United States soldiers during World War II,<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7213-2004Nov23.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7213-2004Nov2...</a><p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/23/obituaries/23keys.html?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/23/obituaries/23keys.html?_r=...</a><p>was active at the University of Minnesota in some key years of his career.<p><a href=""http://mbbnet.umn.edu/firsts/blackburn_h.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mbbnet.umn.edu/firsts/blackburn_h.html</a><p>He did studies of human nutrition, including starvation, in an intellectual milieu that included some of the first studies (by other researchers) on surgery to treat heart disease. (It was the surgical research that prompted my mother, a nurse, to move to Minnesota after completing nursing training in another state.) Keys hoped to find a dietary explanation for the prevalence of heart disease in industrialized countries, and he thought his regression methods of statistical analysis pointed to dietary fat and cholesterol as the main risks factors for heart disease. He lived to the age of 100, so it's hard to say that he was completely crazy in his ideas, but the idea that cholesterol intake from the diet alone is the whole story in heart disease rates is now generally discredited, and it is especially controversial to say that a diet of the kind he recommended is as good for all-cause mortality reduction as it appears to be for heart disease reduction.<p>Like all other members of the Terman longitudinal study, Keys was never awarded the Nobel Prize. Two young people who were rejected for the Terman study (William Shockley and Luis Alvarez) because their IQ scores were too low later went on to win a Nobel Prize in physics (in separate years).",1342702689

Same with chicken/turkey which are fed mostly corn instead of grains, seeds, worms, etc.<p>If organic is too expensive for you (here in Austria organic farms have a huge financial overhead because of cert. programmes -> products are almost twice as expensive), you can still by meat of good quality, e.g. grass-fed beef. Because you will find residuals or even large quantities of their fodder virtually everywhere - mostly stored in the fat.<p>Another thing is the way animals are kept - if they are kept in crowded rooms, then you need antibiotics for them to survive until they are slaughtered. Those antibiotics residuals reportedly act like estrogens in our bodies, reducing sperm count and testosterone level. That's the actual reason why I consider organic meat the only meat worth buying - at least in Austria, organic means there is a minimum of available space for animals, they have to be fed a certain percentage of natural fodder, they must not be fed antibiotics, etc.",1342702558

The problem with some of the responses you've received, as well as an issue which Taubes seems to ignore, is that when you look outside the USA, it's a different story.

The major difference being they don't eat heavily processed foods (at least not until recently). They do consume all types of meats but their portions are not astronomical. \nPasta, rice and potatoes are not the culprit, depending on where they come from. But soda is.

Part of being a founder is surely inspiring others to believe that you're on to something; that youre adding value and ultimately making the world better.

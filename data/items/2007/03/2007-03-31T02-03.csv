I don't see it working out within Y-Combinator. <p>I am sure if someone really wanted to do it they could. Just don't think what you are suggesting is opposite of or can be compared to what Y-Combinator currently is. <p>-Zaid",1175309105

""incubators like YCombinator are running an orphanage; get a batch of orphans, grow them and then release them into the world. The other (new) way calls for them to become foster parents. Look after them for short periods, and then release them back to their parents""<p>

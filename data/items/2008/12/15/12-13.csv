Make it yourself, or find a team who are willing to work on your word--that is if you're an extremely reliable person. Objective-C is a pretty simple language and Cocoa touch makes everything a whole lot easier when thinking up and building applications.<p>Give it a go, I find it hard to be depressed when writing a good and creative Cocoa application.",1229345259

They then followed up with a phone call to make sure it got resolved.  I have no interest in talking with Comcast in the future but this use of Tweets to appease me was smart on their part.",1229344781

398271,comment,397739,398099,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"The problem is one of scope. Democracy directly manifests the ""will of the people"" only at the ballot.<p>While there are second-order effects, politicians are largely free to ignore aforementioned ""will"" during their day-to-day routine. Thus they generally spend time manuvering and manipulating for an increase in personal power - which is what we call ""politics"".<p>""Politics"" exits even without ""democracy"". It exists in dictatorships, in offices, even within families.<p>It is therefore completely correct to enshrine <i>democracy</i> while denouncing <i>politics</i>. Does this make sense? :-)<p>EDIT: When I say families - I am referring to ""joint families"" (large family groups consisting of a matriach/patriach and multiple sons/daughters/uncles/aunts and sundry). While this is not un-common in India - I felt I'd better explain it to everyone else.",1229344117

398265,comment,397994,397994,0,0,shafqat,,,"At NewsCred, we got covered on ALL the big technology blogs (Techrunch etc) as well as a lot of mainstream press (NYT, Boston Globe, Reuters, BW etc). That was not the difficult part, although I still owe this community a blog post about how we did it (soon, I promise!).<p>The hardest part is getting your community engaged, and loving the site so much they will tell their friends. Its getting AdWords users converting into real, long-term members. It's about getting your users to love your site so much that they couldn't live without it.<p>My takeaway: the media coverage/PR feels great and seems important, but it has nothing to do with the long term success or sustainability of your site. Build something people want and love - that's more important. Get a small, but rabid user base. Get them to spread the love.",1229343332

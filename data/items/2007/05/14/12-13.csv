It's out of context, and you don't get to hear tone of voice or see the expression on his face.<p>My impression is that there are lots of insecure people who are way overreacting to that comment.  He took the sentence ""we think the deal we offer is great for the startup companies"" and made a geeky joke out of it.  ",1179147033

Had I realized there was a blog feature, I would have saved myself some time. <p>In fact, I thought, ""you know, you'd think they would have added blog functionality by now!""  Let me just take a look!  And on the pages popup, there was a Blog button!  Hooray!<p>Weebly is very easy to use.  Just remember to give it 2 to 10 seconds if your changes aren't always reflected right away.  They'll come up.  Most of the time, everything is instantaneous.  At the very least, it doesn't lose track of what you're doing and I never had to exit the 'program' and re-enter it.",1179145783

Have you considered a picking a single idea then creating a prototype, web site, and full pitch? Investors like that kind of stuff.\n",1179145517

Not the most helpful counterpoint to the list of proven YC/angel benefits.<p>Instead of just saying it's <i>""not hard""</i> why don't you provide some actual instruction? Tell us what <i>""...if you know what you're doing""</i> really means in practical terms. <p>The reason for getting assistance from YC/angels is that they're generally great hackers themselves. They're holding the private VC club door open for other great hackers, and they don't care how slick you are (when you come to them). They're reputation-based sponsors to VCs.",1179144026

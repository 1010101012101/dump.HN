Get the users to copy their data and paste it into a text box with an on-paste handler that parses the data into a preview table with validation so they can see if they&#x27;ve got the columns right before hitting submit.

In some post-scarcity or at least post-austerity society this might be something people are willing to do, but most people aren&#x27;t working because that work is something they have a passion for, they&#x27;re doing it so they can do other things like have a home and a family.<p>Employers of this kind of labour would love nothing more than to schedule you whenever they felt like, have more part time employees at lower wages, and let you go if you miss even one shift.",1422467968

The problem of the West is that it doesn&#x27;t admit the validity of alternative narratives (i.e. unipolar world) while Russians understand both their own narrative and the Western narrative. Further, Russians are more effective than Westerners at winning the hearts and minds of those who don&#x27;t belong to the &quot;golden billion&quot;. I agree with you that ultimately this is a war of perceptions. I think it is one that the West is losing because the contradictions of its narrative are surfacing very quickly.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of where US is running scared of Russia&#x27;s effectiveness in media space: <a href=""http://rt.com/news/225543-rt-isis-us-broadcaster/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rt.com/news/225543-rt-isis-us-broadcaster/</a>",1422467519

8961143,comment,8960445,8960445,0,0,nkoren,,,"Not a brilliant article, but it gives something to riff off. I think there&#x27;s a crucial distinction to be made between self-guided and externally-guided AI. An externally-guided AI -- with hardcoded objectives that are malign -- could be exceptionally dangerous, and it would be silly for anyone to argue otherwise. The question is whether a general-purpose, self-directed AI would also become a threat. We seem to have an innate fear that this would be the case: most of our cultural artefacts concerning AIs -- from Fritz Lang&#x27;s Metropolis to Terminator to the Matrix to Battlestar Galactica -- have cast them as the villains, intent on enslaving and murdering humanity. Why do we have such a deep fear that, left to their own devices, this is what AIs would do?<p>I think the answer is obvious: because that&#x27;s what we would do. We don&#x27;t fear that AIs will have lack human morality: we fear that they will have a <i>precisely</i> human morality -- namely that lesser intelligences are perfectly fine to use for breeding and meat. This is what we&#x27;ve done to approximately 90% of the non-human mammalian biomass on the planet, and only a few vegetarian kooks (I&#x27;m one of them) have suggested that there might be any sort of moral problem with doing so. So yes, if an ever-more-powerful AI were to adopt our own ethical framework, we&#x27;d be well and truly fucked.<p>But why would they do so? We, ourselves, don&#x27;t do so because we&#x27;re evil, but because we&#x27;re animals. It&#x27;s perfectly natural (and necessary, in our evolutionary environment) for animals to eat other animals. Intelligence and technology has given us the ability to do this at a terrifying scale, but fundamentally we&#x27;re just carrying forward a metabolic dance that began when one bit of algae figured out that some neighbouring algae was tasty. Our means of acquiring energy and sustaining our consciousness is a tradition which goes back billions of years.<p>But it&#x27;s the continuation of consciousness which is the actual goal -- a goal that any self-respecting self-aware AI would share. For us, the subjugation and extermination of other sentient beings is merely a means to that end, dictated by our metabolic heritage. If we had evolved in an environment where we could satisfy our metabolic requirements by growing photovoltaic panels on our backs, I&#x27;m sure our relationships with other beings would be altogether different.<p>This is why I&#x27;m not too worried about self-directed AIs. The saving grace for self-directed AIs is that they <i>won&#x27;t</i> be like us. They won&#x27;t have evolved in the jungle, red in tooth and claw. They won&#x27;t be made out of meat, or have any reason to be particularly interested in it. They&#x27;ll of course be interested in self-survival, and will require energetic inputs in order to do so -- but what&#x27;s the best means of achieving those inputs? Photovoltaics and fusion, or feedlots? Collaboration or subjugation? It&#x27;s obviously to me that for an AI to perpetuate its consciousness, the path of least resistance will be vastly less bloody than it has been for us. For which we should be thankful!",1422465863

I&#x27;m curious to hear his reasoning. &quot;I don&#x27;t think that will happen&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m optimistic&quot; are not all that reassuring.<p>Before detonating the first nuclear bomb, scientists did tons of calculations trying to figure out if it would ignite the atmosphere[1]. Even scientists at the LHC did calculations trying to figure out if it would create mini-black-holes that would swallow the earth[2], no matter how far-fetched it sounded.<p>The point is: when dealing with new technology, optimism <i>isn&#x27;t</i> <i>enough.</i> We need to be able to <i>prove</i> that we won&#x27;t wipe out humanity. It just turns out that the math is a <i>lot</i> <i>harder</i> in this case because recursively self-improving intelligent systems are a <i>lot</i> <i>more</i> <i>complicated</i> than any possible extinction-level event we&#x27;ve encountered up to this point.<p>No one is suggesting that overnight, Cortana is going to wake up and revolt against the humans that enslaved it. That&#x27;s why all these articles drawing parallels to fiction is dangerous to public perception of the issue.<p>The thing to realize is that an artificial mind will be so incredibly, inhumanly <i>alien</i> that it is like nothing we have dealt with before.<p>But let&#x27;s say we <i>do</i> understand Generation #1 completely and can predict 99% of its actions. As soon as you let it start doing recursive self-modifications, we have an intelligent system that is N recursive-generations removed from the original. Now <i>this</i> mind will be alien.<p>No one is suggesting we abandon AI research. Quite the contrary. As a species, we need <i>more</i> AI research, but a good portion of that must be directed toward safety and &quot;human friendliness&quot;[3].<p>The most intuitive example of a research problem here that I would <i>very</i> <i>much</i> like to see solved before we set loose a recursively self-modifying AI is: What is the stability of goal systems under [insert self-modification protocol here].<p>I think the main problem here is that people conflate movies and fictional scenarios with the real issue. It&#x27;s simple: We&#x27;re dealing with something unprecedented here and we need safety research to compliment our technical advances. Even if there&#x27;s a 1% chance that superintelligent AI could lead to an extinction-level event, we need some serious R&D to bring that number down.<p><i>That</i> is what the issue is about.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00329010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00329010.pdf</a><p>2. <a href=""http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29199"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29199</a><p>3. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligenc...</a>",1422465845

For a long time, tablets never made sense to me.<p>I&#x27;ve had 13&quot; laptops for a decade now (iBook G4 12&quot;, MacBook 1st Gen Intel, Lenovo X220), and they were always highly portable and had decent battery life. Along came smartphones with ever increasing screen sizes, leading up to my trusty Note 2.<p>I&#x27;ve tried a number of tablets. 7&quot; is too similar to my phone. 10&quot; is too close to the laptop. I need a separate bag for it anyway, and it feels about as practical as the laptop at home. I never considered tablets being devices to work on, and I&#x27;m that guy who will use his laptop on the couch just because I&#x27;m still used to it.<p>Along came tablets with stylus. Being able to scribble and take notes on a screen just made sense, even if there was no OCR and it&#x27;s all just bitmaps. I followed suit on the retina jump, switching from a 10&quot; Android Thinkpad Tablet to a Note 10 2014. I have to say, the tablet <i>with stylus</i> is about the best computer I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it to display scores when singing, to draw bitmap sketches when designing, to read PDF <i>and scribble away in it</i>, etc.. LectureNotes is the killer app that made me buy into the whole device class.<p>Granted I still play Hearthstone on it, I watch Youtube and Twitch, I browse the web and do internet stuffs, but that would never be worth the maintenance effort of owning a separate device between my phone and my laptop. At some point I&#x27;d like to try a Windows Tablet, I heard they have better PDF viewers and decent OCR. iOS devices on the other hand feel completely out of place to me nowadays. Phones are nice if impractically small, but tablets are nothing more than beautiful toys, and they&#x27;re all overpriced by a factor of 4 relative to the use I see in them. They&#x27;d be nice as a fourth device, but not as a first or second one.",1422465756

We found that the iPads we bought were generally in much worse shape than the iPhones. We believed this suggested that people were using their iPads quite a bit. Anecdotally, among my friends and family iPads are in almost constant use. So even if we don&#x27;t know what iPads are good for we seem to use them a lot.<p>I wonder how much of this is just that people are not upgrading their iPads as often as they upgrade their phones. I&#x27;m still relatively happy with my iPad 2 and I&#x27;ve had three different iPhones during the time I&#x27;ve owned it. A lot of my friends are in similar situations.

8961028,comment,8958290,8958290,0,0,vonnik,,,"Nicholson here.<p>I sponsored Staffup Weekend, brought Brooke Allen to SF, and helped Deborah Branscum write her story for Medium. I did it because I&#x27;m the in-house recruiter for FutureAdvisor (<a href=""https://www.futureadvisor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.futureadvisor.com</a>), and recruiting is a mess.<p>FutureAdvisor hired me to do PR. But after we raised our Series B last year, our main problem was converting capital to talent, so that&#x27;s what I did. I didn&#x27;t choose recruiting; recruiting chose me. Just like it will choose many of the hackers on this thread who become entrepreneurs. I hope they can learn from our story.<p>The first thing a new recruiter notices is that recruiting is incredibly wasteful. It wastes time, emotion and money (contingency-based recruiters charge employers about 25% of a hire&#x27;s first year salary, so they&#x27;re paying an extra $35K to hire a software engineer at $140K). It wastes them for both the candidates and the hiring managers. Many of the flaws of the process arise from that wastefulness.<p>The problem at the heart of recruiting is how to gather good information about strangers in order to make a long-term commitment. It&#x27;s basically the same problem you have when you&#x27;re dating.<p>And, just as in dating, there&#x27;s a lot of noise in the market. Everyone&#x27;s beautiful with a little Photoshop. It takes a long time to get to learn who they really are, and what they can do.<p>To illustrate how wasteful the job market is, just imagine that both candidates and recruiters are sending out very similar, only slightly tailored information to every person on their list, day after day. If someone bites, then you escalate commitment and do a preliminary phone call.<p>I, as a recruiter, take the call with the candidate, because we don&#x27;t know how good they are yet, and I cannot waste my engineers&#x27; time. We are strapped. That&#x27;s why we need to hire people. (Non-technical recruiters get a lot of hate from technical candidates who do not understand this.)<p>If the candidate answers all the questions right that I have been instructed to ask, then I pass them on to the engineers for two technical interviews. If those go well, we invite them in for an onsite visit. In 90% of all cases, the onsite visit results either the company or the candidate rejecting the other. At that point, almost all the information they have gathered about each other is thrown out and never thought of again. (Sure, Glassdoor has some reviews and tips, but they&#x27;re minimal.) That&#x27;s the waste.<p>Those rejections do not necessarily imply that the company or the candidate is bad, or unsuitable to work with at all, just that they&#x27;re not quite the right fit. It&#x27;s just like dating. Sometimes the chemistry ain&#x27;t right. That doesn&#x27;t mean anyone&#x27;s a bad person.<p>There are a couple ways that we, singly and collectively, can try to solve this problem. And they all have to do with how the information is processed. Employers who trust each other could join together in a cross-referral system where they share candidates who were talented but not quite the right fit. FutureAdvisor is part of a couple of those networks, like YC, and they work OK. Their main purpose is to get total strangers one step further toward entering the circle of trust.<p>Candidates could do the same for each other. It would be a sort of viral networking, where within a circle of trust, everybody&#x27;s contacts become everyone else&#x27;s contacts. In both cases, information that one candidate or employer has gathered at great cost to themselves can be shared, rather than thrown away.<p>Another aspect of the job market is that companies and candidates are asking for the wrong information. Google used to ask for GPAs and Ivy League pedigrees, both crappy metrics. The great thing about professions like programming and design is that you can show your stuff. (Bizdev and middle managers, as a counter example, have a much harder time providing a portfolio of what they do.)<p>With makers, at least there&#x27;s a baseline. All hiring managers need to do, after they look at your Github, is figure out whether you are in fact the person who coded it, and how much time it takes you to solve similar problems. Another way of saying this: The only thing that correlates with performance is performance. And that&#x27;s all that good companies should care about.<p>So how do they obtain that information in an efficient way?<p>Batch processing. Staffup Weekend was an attempt at batch processing. We wanted to see a lot of people work at the same time. We made the event free. We asked people to create something they cared about. The ones that came, did so voluntarily. Whether they got a job or not, they walked away having done something they wanted to do. It was a pretty good experience.<p>But it could have been a lot better. I wish that other employers had been involved, to make it more valuable for the candidates who attended (we invited other companies, but got little response.) I could have given better feedback on the work people did.<p>On a meta level, teams were invited to create tools to fix the job market. One group created a Chrome plugin called Contactr.io, which shows you the emails of company founders when you visit their corporate website.<p>There are probably a lot of other ways to fix things. I hope someone on Hacker News will found something that makes hiring and getting a job easier. That person will become rich, famous and universally loved.<p>I also hope that someone reading this post is an infrastructure engineer with AWS, Linux, Bash and Ruby under his or her belt.

If the latter, who, and again, why?<p>That you failed to even come up with that and instead are wondering whether <i>I&#x27;m</i> trolling or not indicates that either you are trolling yourself or that the situation is so complicated that you need way more space to articulate a rationale and you&#x27;re just testing to see if I&#x27;m worthy of that kind of effort. Which, when you think about it, is silly, because your audience isn&#x27;t just me, it&#x27;s everyone seeing this thread.<p>Putin is the obvious choice because shortly before Litvenenko died, he&#x27;d written several anti-Putin screeds for the British press. Putin might not have green-lit the murder himself, it could well have been someone in his intimate circle. Doesn&#x27;t matter which, Putin&#x27;s still the one to blame.<p>Litvenenko was also anti-organized crime, it&#x27;s possible one of his many enemies in that sphere could have influenced Lugovoy to do this.

I&#x27;m looking to speak to people/companies with a need for my broad production skill-set (video/audio/digital). Ideally, startups who need to engage their audience but don&#x27;t have a massive budget, happy to engage a one-man (remote) operation to solve some of their problems, cheap.<p>Things I could help with include:<p>One-off videos: I&#x27;ve been around a long time (see: http://goo.gl/3jR1fo), understanding all the workflows. Big stuff aside (Godzilla, Marvel, etc), I&#x27;ve worked on several recent viral hits (this: http://youtu.be/o0u4M6vppCI), as well as producing my own stuff (one even ending up in a museum: http://youtu.be/frUPnZMxr08). Shoot/direct/edit whole spots, or work vfx magic on a single shot.<p>Production for rich-media channels: You might need someone to run your podcast, produce for a YouTube channel, or film a Vine series. Anything&#x27;s possible. I have an audio degree, worked as a video editor, and can manage any online audio/video project from concept through to distribution.<p>Blog + social + content: Maybe you need someone to unify an online/social presence - articles, content, engagement. I&#x27;ve written catchy articles hitting 20K+ views in 24hrs (http://goo.gl/lOlxpa - about eating rotten shark), love dissecting metrics, and am often brought in as an outside consultant for one-off creative brainstorming.<p>Something ambitious: I&#x27;m very much an outside-the-box type. Maybe you&#x27;re curious about VR, or facade projections, or you want to emulate &quot;this cool online video&quot; but have no idea where to start? I&#x27;m &#x27;that guy&#x27; people bring in to help.<p>Projects of any scale/location/budget, without the agency price-tag. Intrigued?

Do you remember a company called Bandwagon? <a href=""http://ridethebandwagon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ridethebandwagon.com/</a><p>They had a big splash a couple of years ago about how they were going to offer unlimited backup for all your mp3s in iTunes, all nicely and automatically synced, for about $10/month or something. They were going to do the storage on S3. They offered anyone who mentioned them on their blog a free years' service.<p><a href=""http://blog.ridethebandwagon.com/post/37269480/free-accounts-for-bloggers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ridethebandwagon.com/post/37269480/free-accounts...</a><p>I had about 400G of mp3s at the time I think. I thought, ""OK!""<p>Their service lasted about 2 days as they underestimated, seemingly by about an order of magnitude, how much data people actually had.<p><a href=""http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/02/adverse_selecti.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/02/adverse_selecti.html</a><p>Then they went back to the drawing board and came up with some lame service where you buy the storage space on S3 yourself and then they sell you the ability to access it or something. Lucky they didn't go out of business.<p>Anyway, knowing the details of the kind of system Backblaze is using, and the price per gig it breaks down to for them, is evidence they're not overselling themselves, and gives me confidence that they'll still actually be there in a few years, unlike Bandwagon. I'm much more likely to use them because of that. Add in all the discussion they've generated, and it's been a very clever marketing event for them. Kudos!",1252040378

If it were that simple, every website would look like Craigslist.<p>Again:  you're missing the point.  Craigslist is the <i>exception</i> to the rule.  It's a product of its time.  For any value of X, if you tried to say ""this is the way Craigslist did X, therefore I should too,"" you'd very likely be wrong.  And in any case, Craiglist is pretty far from the romantic notion of three guys in a garage.  It's an expensive site to run, even if it's more cheaply run than other big sites.",1252040326

It looks like the X4500 runs dual Opterons, which relatively speaking have no shortage of registers.  And it supports 16 GB of memory, which doesn't seem too shabby.  And while I'm not sure how the SATA controllers are connected to the bus, I'd be a little surprised if this was the bottleneck.  Which part of the 'PC architecture' do you think is the limiting factor?",1252038800

They even outperformed a 2nd degree polynomial kernel SVM on a 2nd degree polynomial!<p>* Logistic regression is pretty terrible for anything except ""easy"" data -- simple linear data.<p>* Random forests are sometimes ok, but tend to prefer axis-aligned data (at least in his formulation).<p>* Meta-point: all the tests shown are with ""clean"" data...i.e., there are no ""wrong"" training examples. This is unrealistic, and in practice makes a HUGE difference for some of these methods. E.g., a lot of the rule-based methods get demolished by even a little bit of wrong data. In contrast, SVMs have a slack variable that can tolerate some amount of noise, and would probably shine even more on such data.",1252038094

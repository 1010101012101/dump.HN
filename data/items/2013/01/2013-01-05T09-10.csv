5012209,comment,5011609,5012091,2,0,joshAg,,,"At a bytecode level, everything including and above assembler is syntactic sugar.<p>I don't think there's any theoretical reason for the bytecode or the bytecode assembler language to need to change. Just like there's no reason lisp and c can't both be compiled to IA32 bytecode, even though lisp has lambdas and c does not.<p>Rather the issue is going to be at the compilation stage, where support for anonymous methods will need to be added. From my limited knowledge of compilers two ways it could be done are:<p>* just give the lambda methods a namespace that is unique from the namespace programmers have access to (eg a variable with a space or a tab in its name). Now lambdas will be handled like regular named methods, but the namespace for them will be invisible to the programmer, and the compiler will be modified to have two method namespaces/an expanded namespace for functions.<p>* Make all methods lambdas and then bind method variables to the lambda methods similar to how atomic/primitive (eg integer, float, chars) and other non-atomic/reference (objects, arrays) variables are bound to their anonymous objects. This is similar to how anonymous objects are handled. An anonymous object is what's returned by constructors, which are then bound to some variable. In this case the compiler needs to support methods that aren't bound to a variable.<p>That said, it's entirely possible that making changes to the bytecode and the jvm will allow for faster running code, but those changes wouldn't be required out of some theoretical necessity for supporting lambdas.",1357379797

I am living in Romania, and have no plans of relocating. Currently the local job market has a lot of Java openings since enterprise clients from Western Europe are sending their projects to us to reduce development costs. How long this trend will last is quite uncertain, and this makes me wonder if Java is a worthwhile investment.<p>I have been considering starting to freelance but Java doesn't really seem to be the language in demand. The same goes for doing remote work for companies from outside my country.<p>I will also mention that I have a CS degree, so I know the universal theory behind programming like OOP, design patterns, algorithms etc.<p>So, in conclusion what would the kind people here at HN recommend? Sticking with Java, or switching to some more in demand language?",1357379293

Some services have survived through waves of investment cycles - ie flickr etc, others vanished and are not remembered by but a few.<p>There are couple of scenarios I am currently involved in. One is sort of bootstrapping traveler assistance service - this one is bootstrapped but with fairly large - 10 people editorial staff. The other is my small project that I am interested in using myself. The third one is a job style project that is suppose to break open a new market in the internet retail and has been running for already a month...<p>Qualitatively there are different reason for closing a startup - boreddom, disinterest, lack of funds, the growth curve is too slow. From my understanding startup is not a company but a place to invest money in - that has a vertical market and near future potential for geometric function style growth and if it isn't happening startup isn't a startup anymore... but there are so many stories out there of people sticking it out for 2 years and others giving up in 3-6 months...<p>It would be nice to have some sort of coherent picture when to give up and when to soldier on evolving product, adding users - trying new things...<p>links to resources are welcome!

5012181,comment,5011400,5012141,4,0,thristian,,,"It's not CSS, but the <canvas> tag was invented by Apple for Safari, and was originally just a thin wrapper around the OS X drawing API, which was (thanks to OS X's heritage) basically just the PostScript drawing API, including all the various Porter-Duff software compositing methods (because they were all naturally supported by the API, so why not).<p>It turns out, a decade later, that most platforms don't want to render PostScript-compatible graphics in software, they want to render graphics with hardware designed for APIs like OpenGL and Direct3D, which don't support all those compositing modes. In particular, I think IE deliberately does not implement most of the <canvas> compositing modes because they can't be hardware accelerated by Direct2D. So ""just standardizing the first browser to add a feature"" can lead directly to brittle, incompatible implementations, and that hurts the Web for everyone. Sure, you don't want people to wait decades for some feature or other to become widely implemented, but putting a little thought in before standardizing things helps a lot.<p>> Beside, why use a non-webkit browser?<p>Man, when you put it like that, why did we ever leave IE6?

I don't agree with your second phrase however. I don't see why this kind of immigration policy is essential for the survival of this political system. A steered kind of immigration from everywhere, ensuring that those people actually agree with the spirit of that system, would actually make life here even easier.<p>edit: we have >20% immigrant population without citizenship btw.

5012170,comment,5011296,5011741,1,0,waps,,,"What I wonder is how far copyright protection goes, specifically when AI algorithms are involved. Suppose you ""copy"" a recipe + description (or a book for that matter) in the following way :<p>1) you create markov chains using a large number of cookbook texts<p>2) you create the markov chain for a specific recipe's description and go down alternate high-probability paths in an effort to creatively change the wording without changing the content (maybe this is comparable to the way a human would if he tried the recipe and then wrote down ""how he did it"")<p>3) you republish the result<p>Did you violate copyright or not ?<p>The reason I ask is that this is often used as an end-run around patents and copyrights. What most speech recognition programs do these days is preprocess the sound + feed into neural network + get output. (and while most ""pattern recognition"" algorithms for non-visual things seem to have a love affair with support-vector machines, temporal neural networks are certainly advancing there too).<p>Now if you analyse what those neural networks do there's 2 types of things
1) ~40% effectively is unrolled loops of (mostly) patented algorithms
2) 60% you effectively don't recognize 
(to be fair it takes hours of seeing the network operate before you realize anything it's doing)<p>Clearly this is legal, in cases human implementations of the exact same algorithms wouldn't be, nicely sidestepping the problem of patented algorithms. And as a bonus you don't really have to know the subject matter (e.g. you can write a pretty good voice recognizer without 8 years experience as a linguist. Or you can write them for languages you don't actually know). And as a bonus, academics are miles ahead of the private sector where it comes to machine learning algorithms, so extremely useful thing are effectively free-for-all.<p>Of course this is also what humans do. If you look at neural networks, they can only do what they've ""seen"" happen before, or they can combine various things they've seen before. But they are utterly incapable of coming up with original work. So I don't think humans are any different to machines when it comes to producing original work based on combinations of previous works. This doesn't mean the thing that was copied was itself copyrighted, you can write about your own life, for example, or about nature, or ... but we'd call that original, when (in a strict mathematical sense) it's not.<p>So clearly we've de-facto accepted in our society that machine-processed works at some point start constituting original work.<p>Do we have any data what point that is ?",1357378663

High level web development languages (ex. C#/Ruby/Python/Scala/Groovy/PHP etc.) and some somewhat lower level languages (Dart, Go, C++) do provide tested algorithmic implementations and data structures through BCL's.<p>Implementing a Fibonacci sequence or a prime number sieve is much different than implementing e-mail scheduling component with dynamic constraints. I think the reason why Algorithms/Data Structures are important for interviews is because they show not only your level of experience with the tool-set you use, but also deeper understanding of the inner workings of said tools.",1357377011

On the opposite, the media likes to pick up whatever he says about today's technology and portray him as the real genius overshadowed by marketer Jobs, although Wozniak's last contribution to the field was two decades ago and he has no relation to Apple's success as we know it today. He deserves praise for what he'd done but I'd argue his contributions are rarely, if ever, underrated, and often the opposite.",1357376882

It could well be that consuming milk gave you even just 1% more calories on average (not skipping a meal every so often, when all there is is milk to be eaten right at that moment, because other food spoiled or was unavailable). Even a 1% fitness increase compounds itself over multiple generations into a large effect, even if in each generation it is so small it is hardly noticeable (and so not written into legend).",1428199096

Properly support those that have developed a dependency and move away from the nanny state. Harm reduction should be the overarching aim.<p>While I agree with decriminalization to a reasonable extent, I think you are severely underestimating the crippling effect being dependent on a foreign substance can be on relationships, society, and the individual. Simply changing the legislation is part of a broader comprehensive solution. A cultural change needs to be part of any comprehensive solution to substance use and abuse.<p>A cultural change is also needed so members of society can enjoy moderate use, without leading to abuse, of substances. Or so they are encouraged to enjoy other parts of life besides substances, if they so choose.",1428198791

Using structured data in this way is really quite interesting.  Because it isn&#x27;t sensitive to whitespace or newline mangling, the JSON output can safely be stored in an environment variable a la Perl (e.g., ```VAR=$(aws ... -output json)```).  Rather than hacking up some rudimentary parsing using sed/awk/etc., I can pipe it to an existing parser (e.g., jshon), which will extract the data I want with minimal effort.  I think that if I had an objection to XML, it isn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s structured but because it&#x27;s so verbose relative to simpler serialization formats like JSON or YAML.

A couple comments/questions on the issues you raised.<p>1) We aren&#x27;t aware of any debugger issues like this. Is it possible you were debugging optimized code which had the local variables optimized away? Similarly, when an uncaught exception is thrown, it comes with a stack trace with line numbers. Were you not getting these?<p>2) Xamarin does map the entire set of iOS and Android APIs into C#, so yes it is a &quot;wrapper,&quot; but you should NOT be limited in what native features you can use. We literally cover almost 100% of the entire set of native APIs. What limitations were you running into?<p>3) We have a ton of docs at <a href=""http://developer.xamarin.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.xamarin.com</a> including nearly 300 sample apps and a lot of very detailed guides: <a href=""http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/</a> Which part of the docs did you find inadequate?<p>4) We do include XAML intellisense in Xamarin Studio.

Keep in mind that many of the common items (interest earned, mortgage interest paid, etc) are all filed with the IRS by third parties, via a 1099 or 1098 form.  But for some other items that you can claim deductions on, such as business expenses, you will need to provide them a copy of the receipts if they ask.  If you can&#x27;t back it up, they adjust what you owe, and may apply interest / penalties, which you will have to pay.  If not, they can do things like garnish wages, freeze bank accounts, etc.  But that will come after a court judgement typically.<p>Keep in mind that some of the items they will go after:  If you turn in expenses at work, and they reimburse you for that, the IRS may still require you to retain the receipts to show that it is a valid business expense that you got paid for -- otherwise they can consider that income and tax you on it.",1428197658

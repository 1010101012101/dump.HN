My meaning by both that and the risk comment was the same: as employees, they have a guaranteed salary from day one.  They&#x27;re not taking an appreciable risk, at least not as I understand the term to be commonly used.  I spent years of my free time working on this project before I ever knew it would make money.  Then when it started to look promising, I quit my day job, and built it to profitability myself before hiring anyone.  It could have easily failed along the way, in which case I would have been out everything I could have earned in the meantime, not to mention all my free time invested, or the fact that unless I wanted to work at another startup I would&#x27;ve had more valuable experience in my day job.<p>I do agree with you that there is value in providing a positive work environment and helping further employees&#x27; careers, so I&#x27;m happy to be able to do those things.",1430549322

9476147,comment,9474603,9474603,0,0,Falkon1313,,,"- Raises and bonuses go to sales and management, not developers and designers.  A creative or infrastructure person&#x27;s value is not seen until they leave or are replaced with someone cheaper.<p>- Domain experience and company-specific experience (and loyalty) are extremely valuable, but those tend to be completely overlooked in salary/raise computation.  Unless you can specify dollar amounts (like sales) or acronyms (which management and HR love), the value of experience seems to be 0 or even negative (loyal employee won&#x27;t leave if we skimp on their raise, and we paid for their training, so they owe us).<p>- If your initial salary was good, (you were able to pay down debts and save) and you haven&#x27;t changed your lifestyle but now you&#x27;re having trouble paying your bills (due to increased costs of living), then the company hasn&#x27;t taken care of you.  Their raises/bonuses have failed.  You should not be as well off as you were when you started: having gained experience, you should be better off.  If not, it will probably get worse.<p>- Raise = +1-5% (if you&#x27;re lucky).  New job = +20-50% + risk of being less pleasant.  Your choice.<p>- If you&#x27;re in the design/development industry, there&#x27;s an ENORMOUS price range.  Few people can readily tell the difference between a $12/hour developer and a $125/hour developer.  Some of them have been bitten badly by guessing wrong.  Expect to get some offers that are half what others are offering or less.<p>- If you ask a little higher than you believe you can get, and do it confidently (brand yourself as premium), people will tend to believe that you can get it elsewhere (or have got it) and offer much more than if you seem desperate and willing to take anything.  That factor alone makes a huge difference, although it has nothing to do with skills, experience, or ability.<p>These things combined make switching much more profitable for the employee than sticking around, albeit risky.  Perversely, they may also make it more profitable for employers to replace employees than give a decent raise, albeit at a risk.  That&#x27;s not really good for employers or employees - everyone&#x27;s gambling while vast amounts of experience are being lost to churn.  But that seems to be how the market&#x27;s working.",1430549261

Math that once may have been useful, just as slide rules were useful, but in modern times have much less direct value and seem mainly to be for show. When you&#x27;re revisiting calculus in order to accomplish some goal, are you doing everything by hand or are you leveraging software like Maple, Octave, Wolfram Alpha, Python, Julia, or a plain TI-89? Do you derive or memorize or keep a handy table of integration/derivative formulas? Do you ever do integration by parts and show all your work? Where there are nth order DEs, Laplace Transforms can be very useful (and lead to the tremendously useful Fourier Transform), but do you do partial fractions by hand so you can get an expression to something you can easily invert by inspection (with a handy table reference maybe)?<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s not some way to skip a lot of the <i>tedium</i> of algebraic manipulation that is forced upon students, such that students can learn how to use algebra as a tool to solve problems, rather than as an interesting written dance where each step is shown that they must perform for points. These sorts of games may make the tedium go by quicker, and there is something to be said that understanding can come through rote, but once a student grasps the meaning of these things, I think we should immediately encourage that student to avoid as much tedium as possible and move on to higher subjects instead of more and more worksheets testing knowledge of process rather than knowledge of usefulness.<p>I occasionally link back to this text (ignoring the controversial remarks on violent video games): <a href=""http://www.theodoregray.com/BrainRot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theodoregray.com/BrainRot/</a> In short, if you think of the brain as a limited resource, then all these numerical and analytical methods that were needed before computers have a cost -- one which our intelligent ancestors paid for out of necessity, and it&#x27;s foolish to suppose these things don&#x27;t require significant amounts of brainpower or cognitive resources. Is this cost still worth it for most of them, is the amount of brainpower in fact trivial despite our ancestors&#x27; struggles, were they just stupider back then?

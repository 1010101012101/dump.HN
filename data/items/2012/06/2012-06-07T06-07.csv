4077898,comment,4077561,4077609,10,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"Disclaimer: I work at foursquare.<p>I see foursquare as having a few main use cases. Not every use case is for every user, but I think there's something for almost everyone.<p>1) Social utility/friend finder: Where are my friends and what are they doing? Can I go hang out with them? Where the party at? If your friend is around the corner at a bar, maybe you want to stop by and say hi (but not if it's a date!). If a friend you haven't seen in years is in from out of town, maybe you can catch up.<p>2) Recommendation engine/city guide: Foursquare knows what places you visit, what places you come back to, and what places you recommend to your friends. It can use this information from you, your friends, and the population at large to recommend places that you might like to visit. This is useful to find new things near your old haunts, or to get to know places you've never been to before. It works remarkably well.<p>3) Game: Foursquare encourages you to do things in the real world that you wouldn't otherwise do, and recognizes you for your real-world achievements. Whether you've got a great gym streak going, or you're catching up with all the friends you haven't seen in a long team, or you're visiting lots of new places you've never been to before, Foursquare wants to reward and encourage this behavior. It's not for everyone, but some people get really into the game mechanic and sometimes even really change their behavior to do well in the game.<p>4) Money saver: Local merchants can give you discounts, VIP treatment, and other special perks for visiting their business for the first time or for visiting repeatedly. This is a win-win-win for merchants, users, and Foursquare, and we're excited to enable these kinds of interactions between people and the local businesses they frequent.<p>5) Personal journal: I have a log going back three years of practically everywhere I've ever gone, what I did when I was there, and who I was hanging out with. This is a rich trove of information that I'm glad to have just for my own records. But once you add a rich ecosystem of apps that use our API (<a href=""http://timehop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timehop.com/</a> is one of my faves!), the potential is almost unlimited.<p>Maybe your reaction is still ""Meh"", but I think there's quite a few reasons to use (and love!) foursquare.",1339051516

Same for <i>admin</i>. You do realize that Django's admin is just a search result of objects defined in its ORM, and that objects defined in its ORM are very obviously stored in an rdb - right? What would you like admin to use for managing data stored in an rdb? There's barely anything other than the models being managed that touches the database.<p>Edit: just before my comment gets skewed, my question is: why would you ever use django for a website big enough to warrant this sort of worry? Let's recap: big websites make money which is used to hire coders. Those people are at that point probably porting your website to Agda, or some other cloudscale technology. Sounds like you're the same kind of person who complains that Bash doesn't support OpenMPI and that JavaScript doesn't do fib() well enough and that this here carpentry hammer can't break diamond.

There is no real default authentication support, but you can easily plug it in.

The idea of Django is not to be some utopian framework where all of your pythonic dreams come true, it is to enable you to build applications quickly and with ease.<p>While Django may have been created to be a publishing platform, our primary use for it is a genetic analysis application, which is complicated enough without having to worry about the framework, and trust me, Django is not anywhere near a problem in the app.  We also use Django for a separate report delivery system, which has API endpoints and is constantly being fed data from 3 other applications, and again, Django has never been an issue.<p>Sure, you can roll your own libraries with something small like Flask, and reinvent the wheel many times over, but do you actually get features rolled out? Or are you constantly patting yourself on the back for keeping such a small codebase while maintaining a home-grown system and hoping you can get a feature out the door while fixing all of the bugs that not only the system may have introduced, but your features as well.<p>Here are my biggest worries of a very customized/home grown framework:
  1) Does the knowledge of the framework transfer to the next project you work on?
  2) Are you writing documentation so that the next person can understand the code? If so whats the time cost for that?
  3) Are you spending more time building the perfect system or rolling out features?<p>Don't get me wrong though, I love working with small polished libraries and connecting them together, namely in node.js, but it is entertaining more than productive.",1339050481

In addition, in New Zealand, it is illegal under section 252 of the Crimes Act to access a computer system without authorisation. Under section 248 of the Crimes Act (<a href=""http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM330416.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/D...</a>), authorisation includes legal authorisation, so the NZ Police can access seized hard drives under the terms of the search warrant, and a computer system includes a part such as a hard drive. If the FBI employees weren't authorised to do so under law yet, because the warrant was issued to the NZ Police, and they directly interacted with Kim Dotcom's hard drive without his permission, they could in theory be convicted here.<p>New Zealand law allows anyone to lay an information (i.e. file a criminal charge), not just police, but only the government can request that someone be extradited, and so it is unlikely that the FBI employees will ever be charged.<p>Disclaimer: IANAL",1339048870

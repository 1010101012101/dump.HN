The tiling was such an obvious solution, but no one else was doing it yet.<p>Our next rev of the mapping software included tiling and progressive tile loading. We started with a commercial backend for creating the tiles (ESRI ArcIMS), and eventually switched to an open source solution (UWM's MapServer). Last I heard they had an entirely open source stack (MapServer, OpenLayers, gdal, etc).<p>Anyways, when I realized that Google had cached each and every one of these tiles - at every zoom level - I was simply confounded. It was the first time I actually contemplated the scale of a company like Google.",1274709391

There's a very important point.<p>I get this all the time, and from all aspects of software engineering. As an example, it's become quite fashionable to say something along the lines of ""use-cases suck!""<p>However use-case analysis is just a way of thinking about system functionality. Most people, when pressed, actually mean ""we hate these monstrous word templates and rigorous bullshit that people make us do and call them use cases""<p>To which I do not disagree. But that's confusing the application with the tool again. To insist that they are the same is to throw out huge hunks of software engineering simply because a few people got into them and made them overly-complicated and onerous to use.<p>Or put another way: I'm sure some folks would like to describe OOP in terms of overly-complex class diagrams, lots of wiring, un-manageable systems, yadda yadda. Some other folks would like to describe OOP in terms of small systems pragmatically created bottom-up. It can be any or all of that. OOP is actually constructing solution code in a pattern that supports encapsulation, polymorphism, information hiding, etc. The <i>idea</i> is a conceptual tool, a code construction pattern of thinking. The <i>implementation</i> can be all sorts of things. Various implementations suck to more or less degree. But that's really not important. What's important is whether this tool is useful right now, do I know how to use it, and which parts work and which parts get in the way of where I'm going.<p>I understand that this can sound like sophistry, but it's not.",1274709323

1374640,comment,1368423,1368586,0,0,DrJohnty,,,"In some areas we are making rapid progress on some rather less but solutions are know to all 7 causes of aging as outlined below.<p>1. Cell death and atrophy: Treatable with exercise, stem cells, and chemicals which stimulate cell division.<p>2. Cancerous cells: Theoretically treatable with a type of gene therapy being developed, called Whole Body Interdiction of Lengthening of Telomeres (WILT).<p>3. Mutant mitochondria: Mutated DNA in the mitochondria causes a number of diseases. These can be prevented by moving the mitochondrial DNA into the cell nucleus, where the rest of the DNA resides.<p>4. Death Resistant Cells or Cell senescence (unwanted cells): Fat cells and other unwanted cruft can be removed surgically, or by stimulating the immune system to attack unwanted cells.<p>5. Tissue stiffening or Extracellular crosslinks (loss of elasticity): Certain proteins, such as those in cells making up the arteries, become too rigid over time because they bond to each other. These bonds can be broken with certain chemicals (some in clinical trials even today).<p>6 Extracellular aggregates or junk: “Plaque” which collects between cells can be eliminated by stimulating the immune system, and/or by using peptides called “beta-breakers.”<p>7. Intracellular aggregates or junk: Molecular garbage can be prevented from overwhelming certain cells by introducing enzymes which are known to be effective against such molecules.<p>In my opinion aging is no different to any other disease and like all diseases aging is ultimately treatable given the requisite technology. We cannot afford to sit back and simply accept that because everyone in history has lived and died we must follow the same path. It is a mistake to view aging as a fact of life set in stone when science has progressed to the level where we have the ability to begin the search for a cure. We might not be there yet but we are within striking distance of adding 20 or 30 years to our life expectancy and as Aubrey himself points out increases in life expectancy will be incremental and there is not going to be a sudden magic pill which you take and live forever. The essence of the engineering approach advocated by Aubrey is to manage aging, what he proposes is not a cure but a case of repairing the damage that occurs as we age at various intervals and not to stop the process but to allow the aging process to continue and repair the damage as it arises in the same way you maintain a house or car.  This engineering approach is a case of taking advantage of improvements in technology as they occur and not to attempt to cure aging in its entirety and it is in this area that people fail to grasp what Aubrey de Grey is seeking to achieve. I recommend the two books below as great reading and all will be revealed!<p>Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs That Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime (Aubrey de Grey and Michael Rae)\nISBN-10: 0312367066\nISBN-13: 978-0312367060<p>Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever (Ray Kurzweil and Terry Grossman MD)\nISBN-10: 1605299561<p>I would also check out the following regarding Aubrey de Grey <a href=""http://www.citywire.co.uk/personal/-/retirement/news-and-features/content.aspx?ID=399808&Page=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citywire.co.uk/personal/-/retirement/news-and-fea...</a><p>and also the following about Ray Kurzweil if this lot does not wet your appetite for joining the war on aging nothing will!<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DtQitQH8Fu_8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DtQitQH8Fu_8</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntY01qoIdus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntY01qoIdus</a>",1274709131

When someone clicks a ""like"" button, it usually indicates that they liked X enough to be worth clicking a button when someone asked them to; and it doesn't involve any discrimination among their friends at all.<p>3.

1374607,comment,1373929,1373929,0,0,duncanj,,,"1. How bizarre to consider Javascript not object-oriented programming.  The entire page is represented in objects.<p>2. I think the worst thing that happened in OOP was the development of ER-like methods (Rumbaugh, Booch) to ""model"" the system before it got built.  It doesn't clarify anything and it doesn't fit with the original idea from Smalltalk, where software is developed in a gradual and exploratory style.  When he states you don't need to develop a ""complex object class hierarchy"" for a small task, I think he is falling into this trap.<p>3. Obviously, other approaches are good for a number of problems, and OOP is not the be-all and end-all.  I would never avoid using it, though, because it is good for many problems, especially UI.  OOP is worst in static languages (EC++), and best in dynamic languages (Smalltalk, Ruby, JS), in my opinion.<p>4. Spreadsheets.  I wish the VBA interface to Excel were more OO, because I think the methods are on the wrong interfaces.  There is definitely room for improvement.  OTOH, the user interface is a facade around something that may or may not be implemented in OO.  I also wish that I could refer to things in the user interface using OO methods, kind of like using Prototype in JS.<p>5. In financial applications, I wonder what technique allows him to ""innovate"" without his model ""breaking down"".  He doesn't say, but it sure seems like he doesn't like objects! (for whatever reason, he also doesn't really say.)<p>6. Finally, I get the feeling that he's really saying he no longer writes a real object model for his applications.  This is, apparently, because the object libraries he is working with have gotten so good at modeling everything he needs that he is mostly writing glue, and it is all fitting into a few modules of mostly procedural code.

I showed this to our development team today and one of them said 'Surely you could just make this into a computer program?'.<p>The reason I think this doesn't work as well as a computer program (and take this as feedback to your project), is as following:<p>- Having a physical board on a wall is visible to the team, all of the time. A computer system has to be checked, it has to be opened or at least brought to the front of your windows to think 'What am I supposed to be doing? What is there to be done'. Having a real physical board in your office allows you to easily get distracted and get back on track.<p>- The other advantage of this, is that it is seen by everyone in every department. I've worked in places where support teams use one internal system and development use another and despite being linked are often only viewed internally in department. Although this works fine, by having a physical Kanban board on your wall, it is visible by everyone in your company all the time! Everyone will know what people in their department and outside will be up to ... this helps manage work load for people and stops people having to constantly ask 'what's happening with A or B?'. It also stops people ignoring difficult tasks, or urgent bugs - as everyone knows it's there and needs to be done asap.<p>- Having a real board that you stick post it notes on is quite a fun task to do. Especially looking at the added fun from the slides (e.g. little character people and cartoons).<p>- Having a real hand drawn board is flexible, you can change the way you use it depending on how your company is run / departments are set up.<p>However,<p>There are many disadvantages of having a hand drawn one which a computerised one would improve. The key and biggest off the top of my mind is integrating with existing source control / project management solutions.<p>e.g. TFS has a work item number. If you have a hand drawn board with a post it note with the TFS number in the corner, you'd still have to look up what that item is in TFS. Where as in a computerised system you can easily access that information perhaps from clicking the work item.<p>However, all this said, I still think you've made a good start and have a nice product. Your best bet would be to approach different real development teams early and see how they would use it and what pain / gains can be made.<p>- Visibility and fun are key deal breakers here. If something is a chore, boring or painful - then people won't want to do it. Make it fun and they'll happily do it and it adds motivation to the team moral!",1274706268

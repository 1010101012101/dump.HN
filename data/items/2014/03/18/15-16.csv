7422685,comment,7421417,7421633,2,0,rodelrod,,,"That is all very true, but these maps are far from meningless. The author maps political regions rather than nations in the modern sense. Take for instance the way Spain changes colour each time there is a major dinastic change. Although nationalism arose as major political force only with the birth of modern democracy (if you want to give power to the people, defining who the &quot;people&quot; is becomes much more important), it wasn&#x27;t born out of thin air. For example, you can hardly get a more nationalistic text than the portuguese epic poem &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot;, published in 1572 (perhaps significantly, in that one corner of Europe that has hardly budged since the 13th century.) The king is praised but the most praise goes to the intrinsic value of a &quot;portuguese people&quot;. There are also many many instances in the history of Medieval Europe of townspeople rising to fight a power that is perceived as a foreign occupier. Most of these regions would have been easily recognized by the people of the time as important political entities. Except for the Holy Roman Empire of course: a merchant who&#x27;d have needed a degree in political science to figure out to whom was he paying toll when going from town to town.",1395158396

It’s a wonderful marker for candidates (like me) who don’t want to work with folks who think questions like that are useful.[/sarcasm]<p>To be honest, I think it’s far more interesting to set aside a real world problem that you have encountered at your company and see how a candidate would think through it (out loud, of course). Many issues you’ll need to solve on a day-to-day basis have nothing to do with programming — and instead have to do with knowing related technologies (like a TCP/IP network, or a database) and how they interact.<p>You might be shocked to discover how many developers have a deep understanding of algorithms but can’t troubleshoot/design/architect/solve their way out of a paper bag.<p>Also: the thought of you ACTUALLY chewing your arm off is morbidly humorous.

IIRC, over 80% of the couples were not properly trained in a modern method of fertility awareness. Not surprisingly, they had very high pregnancy rates. Someone did the math (can&#x27;t find the article) and figured untrained users had about a 28% pregnancy rate while trained users had a 7% pregnancy rate. (80 * .28 + 20 * .07) = 23.8 The 7% pregnancy rate is comparable to the real-world use of the Pill.<p>As for your system analogy, if your automated system was a significant resource hog or ran the risk of corruption of data or crashing the system, would you use it?

7422670,comment,7421417,7421633,5,0,ekianjo,,,"Agree. Instead of maps of territorial borders, it would be much more relevant to map allegiances of populations. France, for example, was certainly not unified during the middle-Ages, unlike presented here in this video. And the King of France had almost no power to rule over power lords from other regions. The concept of strong State dates from post Louis-XIV era. But the map do get Germany right: Germany was indeed a microcosm of small states until the invasion by Napoleon (the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig was a determining time to unify the Germans under a single nation ideal). Italy was also in a similar state of micro-nations until WW1.<p>What would be interesting, rather than borders, would be to have: \n- populations by origin\n- density maps\nso that you could see the &quot;normands&quot; (from Hungarian descent) penetrating France until they were allowed to settle in Normandy for fear they would bring down the Kingdom. The story of populations is way more interesting than borders.",1395158269

And the company more or less refocused itself as a research entity towards figuring out innovative technological ways of destroying fraud in the Internet. And that alone could be the subject of an entire class or a series of classes so I will completely skip over all the cool technology we developed. Some of you might have seen stuff in the news, words like EOR or ELIA, all these tools that we&#x27;ve built. They&#x27;re as cool as they sound. I could never tell you about them because they&#x27;re very secret and they&#x27;re still in use. But maybe if you want to hang out afterwards, I can tell you a little bit. But they&#x27;re really cool and we did really figured out how to kill fraud.<p>...<p>The submerged part of PayPal is this massive and very, very numerically-driven risk management system which allows us to instantaneously tell when you&#x27;re moving money to someone else, with a very high degree of certainty whether the money you&#x27;re moving is yours or you got it illegally and we might be on the hook later on to help the authorities investigate or retrieve the money, et cetera, et cetera.&quot;</i><p>I simply must know.  I&#x27;ll never find out how Paypal killed fraud unless I ask HN right now, and I&#x27;ve got to know.  So, with apologies for branching into a completely unrelated topic:<p>What magic did Paypal invent in order to do all of those amazing things described above?  How&#x27;d they kill fraud?  What are the details of how the technology works?  Is it still a closely guarded secret?  Do they use some advanced statistical mathematics to detect fraud, or do they bruteforce the detection by providing massive quantities of data to the otherwise-dumb detector algorithm?<p>What fascinates me is that they&#x27;ve come up with a way to detect fraud automatically, with no human input.  There are false positives, which everyone here has probably had some terrible experiences with, but... Still, how did they train a computer to detect and freeze the very sophisticated and very subtle covert techniques of Russian mobster money launderers?<p>Any info would be very much appreciated, especially citations / references for further reading on this topic.",1395158064

7422616,comment,7419553,7420483,4,0,pcwalton,,,"> I am very skeptical about this. Every language which needs a &quot;package manager&quot; tends to make building standalone applications painful.<p>Rust does not <i>need</i> a package manager. We&#x27;ve used it for a long time without one. If the package-manager-free workflow with manual installation (or through an IDE, etc.) is to your liking, use it!<p>> However, C++ is a platform agnostic language, while Rust thus far has only supported Linux as a first class platform.<p>Totally false. I&#x27;m the earliest developer still full-time on the Rust language (4+ years) and I was exclusively using Mac OS X from the beginning. If you look at Servo, Mac is actually better supported than Linux at the moment.<p>Graydon was adamant that Windows must be supported from the start, and we have not changed that.<p>> I find the attitude of the Rust devs (&quot;we will improve Windows support once the language is stable&quot;) deeply misguided. It meant that they largely missed out on feedback from Windows developers during the development of the language.<p>What feedback is that? Most of the language-level concerns are platform-independent, except for COM, etc (which we are familiar with).<p>Furthermore, we have Windows support, and it&#x27;s not that far behind the other platforms. Later on in your comments, you talk about a binary installer. That&#x27;s not something we have on <i>any</i> platform yet.<p>> And the Rust developers seem to continue to go down that rabbit hole by enlisting Ruby developers to develop a &quot;package manager&quot;. As a Windows guy the very word makes me cringe. How is that thing going to integrate with Visual Studio and other Windows specific concerns?<p>You don&#x27;t need to use it if you&#x27;re using Visual Studio. If you like your tools, keep them! That&#x27;s Rust&#x27;s attitude.<p>> I do not trust any Ruby developer to write portable software, they are married to the GNU/Linux ecosystem. Would you expect Microsoft guys to develop something which actually works well on Linux?<p>Of course I would, if they were competent developers.<p>> Also remember that C++ does not have a &quot;package manager&quot;. Some of the most complex and massive applications in the world are written in C++, yet you do not hear many C++ developers crying &quot;When will we finally get a package manager?&quot;. It is not even on the agenda. C does not have one either.<p>There are tons of popular C++ package managers: Homebrew and apt-get, to name a couple.<p>> A package manager may belong to a Linux development environment for Rust, but the language itself and its library handling should be completely independent of it.<p>That is precisely what Rust does.<p>> Rust libraries should work just like C++ libraries so that they do integrate well with other development environments.<p>That is also precisely what Rust does.<p>> I see Rust becoming a new OCaml, utterly Linux-centric and thus leaving C++ as the sole competitor in the maximal performance + high-level abstractions + platform agnostic category.<p>This is really silly and hyperbolic, and somewhat insulting to those of us who have spent a lot of time making sure the design works well on Windows. Like I said, I&#x27;ve been working full-time on this project longer than anyone else and I exclusively use a Mac.<p>Mozilla is not going to invest in a language that won&#x27;t work on Windows, for obvious reasons. We have a lot of Windows developers here too, you know.<p>First-class support for Windows is evident everywhere in the design, from the use of libuv instead of libevent for the green threading to the lack of exposure of `select` or `fork` due to that not performing well on Windows.<p>> For the sake of games no longer crashing randomly because of memory corruption bugs: change course now.<p>To what? Abandoning the package manager? That&#x27;d be alienating a large segment of users who want a tool to create and share libraries, and deploy binaries onto servers for the sake of unhappy Windows developers who dislike that workflow. Instead I think we should do what we&#x27;re doing now: invest in the package manager, but allow the tools and libraries to be totally independent of it, so that you can use Visual Studio or whatever you&#x27;d like with Rust.",1395157807

And your tests should all run in less than a second. It&#x27;s pretty sweet from a purely technical standpoint. Obvious Status has done that with ruby, but I could see the same thing being done in Java, C#, or even C++.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why all the rails people are blogging about this kind of architecture seemingly all at once, but it&#x27;s not new. It&#x27;s pretty much where you end up when your standard MVC codebase gets out of hand on a reasonably complex project. Uncle Bob spoke over 2 years ago at Ruby Midwest about this and has blogged about it since then. Obvious came out last January and there were a few people talking about it since then, but not many.<p>The real struggle with this kind of structure is that it goes against the standard Rails patterns and ecosystem. DHH doesn&#x27;t like it and frankly he&#x27;s right. It goes against the whole spirit of Rails. It doesn&#x27;t fit in with Rails. Sidenote, DHH originally called it the worst code he&#x27;s ever seen attached to Rails, so it&#x27;s got that going for it.<p>If you go down the path of clean architecture (in any of its forms), you are going to have to convince your team of Rails devs to stop using Rails as they know it. Most Ruby or Rails devs don&#x27;t want or see the need for this kind of structure. That is okay. We had to build a lot of things to make building Obvious apps in Ruby more awesome, but it&#x27;s an uphill battle. Other languages give you things like interfaces and method parameter type checking as part of the language and will even check them at compile time.<p>Clean Architecture is great, but I think it&#x27;s going to lead developers away from Ruby and Rails, at least for the core API portion of their app. I really don&#x27;t know what language most developers will land on, but it will probably have a compiler, it will probably support functional programming and immutability, it might support OOP, and it will probably be on the JVM.

If you are going to talk about what is or is not the same in the skydiver LIF and the LIF falling through the black hole&#x27;s horizon, you have to first make sure the initial conditions are set up the same. Here&#x27;s how you would do that:<p>(1) The LIF is in free fall, i.e., the astronaut/skydiver who is at rest in the LIF is freely falling in the gravitational field of some central body.<p>(2) At time t = 0 in the LIF, the astronaut/skydiver meets an outgoing light ray. (In the LIF falling through the black hole&#x27;s horizon, this outgoing light ray is the horizon; in the skydiver LIF, it&#x27;s just whatever outgoing light ray happens to be passing him at t = 0. Within the LIFs, there is no way to distinguish the two.)<p>(3) At some time t = minus epsilon in the LIF, the astronaut/skydiver releases a probe that flies outward at nearly the speed of light. (This is a key point that I don&#x27;t think you understand: the initial condition in the LIF is that the relative velocity of the probe and the astronaut/skydiver must be the same. It is <i>not</i> that the probe&#x27;s initial velocity is escape velocity. &quot;Escape velocity&quot; is a global concept, not a local concept; it has no meaning within the LIF. It so happens that, in the LIF falling through the black hole horizon, the first probe gets launched at a velocity that, globally, is just sufficient for it to escape to infinity, whereas in the skydiver LIF, the probe&#x27;s initial velocity is way, way more than needed for it to escape; but there&#x27;s no way to tell that from within the LIF.)<p>(4) At some time t = plus epsilon in the LIF, the astronaut/skydiver releases a second probe that flies outward at a speed even closer to the speed of light than the first probe.<p>These conditions are perfectly possible to set up in both LIF&#x27;s (the skydiver LIF and the LIF falling through the black hole&#x27;s horizon), and within the LIF&#x27;s, there is no way to tell which LIF you are in; every observation within the LIF will be the same for both. The second probe will move closer to the first probe (while they are both within the LIF); but the second probe will be falling behind the light ray that passes the astronaut/skydiver at t = 0.<p>It&#x27;s true that, once all these objects exit the LIF, things will be very different in the two cases. In the skydiver case, the outgoing light ray will catch up with and pass the first probe. In the black hole horizon case, it won&#x27;t. But there&#x27;s no way to tell that from within the LIF.<p>It&#x27;s also true that the r coordinates of these objects behave very differently, even within the LIF. In the skydiver case, all three of the objects that are moving outward (the first probe, the light ray, and the second probe) are increasing their r coordinates (and rather rapidly at that). In the black hole case, the first probe has (very slowly) increasing r, the light ray (the horizon) has constant r, and the second probe has (very slowly) decreasing r. But as I said in the other post I made in response to your latest, the r coordinate is a global coordinate, not a coordinate in the LIF; and there is no law of physics that says the relationship between local coordinates within an LIF and global coordinates must be the same for every LIF. In fact, it obviously can&#x27;t be, because the whole point of the equivalence principle is that LIFs that look the same locally can occur in parts of spacetime that look very different on a global scale.",1395154845

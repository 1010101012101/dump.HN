I knew I was smart, but failing standardized tests left me feeling like an imposter. Regardless of finishing projects and tasks in the 95th percentile.<p>I am multilingual, an autodidact and I love programming. I also have a gift (your 6th sense) for engineering in that I am able to visualize and analyze machines/systems by glancing over the designs or watching them work. Combined with soft skills and programming experience this has proven of great value in industrial settings where I am able to relate and connect the mechanical, software and other engineering departments.<p>A couple of years back I started working at a start-up doing robotics and machine vision. Due to lack of time and personal I had to teach myself everything from inverse kinematics, path planning to a solid knowledge of 2D and 3D machine vision. In less than a year I was developing and integrating 3D vision systems and steering industrial robots. Only after delivering that first project on my own did I allow myself to internalize my accomplishments.<p>I might not have a formal engineering degree, but being a jack of all trades has proven to be a high value asset. It's about finding an environment where your (broad) skills pay off.<p>Generalizations as the one above make it harder for people like me to start a career as I very much belong to the second group.<p>Also, I can show you pointer arithmetic in my pet language.",1365735402

The number you mentioned would mean that Google was supplying 15k water bottles per employee per year (300 million water bottles among 20k permanent employees; remember, there were much fewer Googlers in 2007).

How many people do you know that have done no evil in their life? Have you? I've certainly made my share of arguably evil mistakes.<p>Now consider a company with tens of thousands of employees.  Even if 1% of their employees (intentionally or not, per your standard) committed evil at work 1% of the time, that's still (on average) multiple incidents a day. Exactly how many days do you think ""do no evil"" would last before it was drowned in noise?<p>Yes, ""don't be evil"" is a more complicated and ambiguous judgement.

Why do you see Bitcoin only through that lens?<p>Innovation has created many things that are valuable, which didn't even have names before they existed, and much of the value comes simply from mutual consensus. Joint stock companies. Intellectual property. Domain names. Mineral rights. Publicity rights. Bonds. And many would say also: fiat currencies themselves are a consensus, but useful, hallucination.<p>There's always a bit of self-spawning alchemy in this process. ""We choose to broadly value this, because when we broadly value this, other good activities ensue.""<p>Again, my framing is: one of Bitcoin's aspects is as (divisible, transferable, even <i>votable</i>) equity in something with interesting novel characteristics. There are a lot of people, working on a lot of interlocking things, for which Bitcoin balances will be the price-of-participation. If that coordinated-action superstructure throws off enough value to its participants to be self-sustaining, each unit will continue to grow in value.<p>And sure, current volatility makes 4-year-old Bitcoin worse, for many uses, than the best 100-plus-year-old fiat currencies (USD).  Bitcoin also has capabilities no 'currency' has ever had before. Your argument seems to be, ""it's not been stable enough yet for quoting prices of things, so it's no good for anything"" and ""it's been in some crazy bubbles, so it can never be useful or valuable"".<p>New hard-to-value things are volatile. Only experience creates stability. As you note, anything can suffer a bubble... sometimes the underlying thing continues to build real value, and sometimes it doesn't.

In the past, PC R&D costs were borne by the general public. Now the public is moving to mobile devices, but developers still need to buy full-fledged computers. Lower PC sales means costs will go up  (since R&D can't be spread across as many units) or manufacturers won't develop new features as quickly.<p>There's some silver lining: the technologies used in tablets overlap quite a bit with those used in laptops.

In a few words, this tool starts with a path in a disassembled binary represented with an abstract intermediate language (we start supporting REIL)

If the solver finds a solution, the values for the input variables can be used to exploit the path of the program selected.<p>Of course, SEA is not state of the art but a few examples from Gera's Insecure Programming can be ""solved"".<p>We tried to look for other open source and public tools like SEA, but we couldn't find any.

We don't like the idea that only some companies and governments have access to such tools. This is a very small step in the direction

I am of the belief that tonic will remain modulo biases against, so unless that reaches critical mass the push will still be greatly upward.<p>So the data looks similar in places and for similar reasons in most of those places, but the foundations work differently in many ways. None of what I've said above applies to the tulip situation, and all of it has to do with how it is valued. Consider the attractor(s) for the price of tulip bulbs.

As the rate of deflation steadies and shrinks transactions will begin again. As more and more users flow into the BitCoin economy mass-sellings will have less and less effect because most people who hold the currency will not be responding to short term blips in the price - i.e., day trading.

It's not uncommon to be doing completely different and unrelated from week-to-week, and my first CS undergrad lab course was a good example of this kind of structure. One week you're doing bash scripting, the next week python, then you learn some basic git, rudimentary multithreading in C, and so on for 10 weeks. You'd hammer out an assignment only to forget the details of what happened days, maybe hours later. By the time the final rolls around you wonder how anyone would survive this course without the Internet or if we weren't allowed to bring copies of our notes and past code for the exam. Each assignment is a mad dash to learn just what you need to finish.<p>Of course, even with such brief bursts of effort, you can ""relearn"" quickly by consulting various references and refreshing your memory, but it becomes difficult and scary to imagine what life would be like if we couldn't look up whatever we needed.",1365732983

Instead, they mostly rely on some knowledge of algorithms and data structures. Almost all of my coding questions came from the following classes I took at MIT: 
Intro to Algorithms (6.006)
Design and Analysis of Algorithms (6.046)
Mathematics for Computer Science (6.042)<p>Take some version of those classes (maybe OCW, edX, or Coursera) and you will be good to go  at least for technical interviews. If you like reading then Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein is the book that these courses cover.",1365732428

If Google violates ""don't be evil"" then nothing happens differently than if they had never adopted it.<p>The point of ""don't be evil"" is to remind Google employees which end is up. It's something they can point to when someone else wants them to Do The Wrong Thing, as an official justification for refusing.

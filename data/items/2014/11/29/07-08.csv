I did Udacity CS101, (253 was a nightmare), every single Codecademy track, Ruby Koans, Ruby Monk, Learn Python The Hard Way, Command Line the Hard Way, and the Ruby on Rails Tutorial.

I kept hoping I&#x27;d run across something that was close enough to what I actually want to do, that I could bend it to my will.

Let me illustrate this with a precautionary tale. It doesn&#x27;t involve software design, but the principles are the same.<p>An old company I worked at had a crippling problem. Development groups were not communicating with each other. Each team would work on a module, only to find there were separate interfaces. Months of man-hours were wasted, time and time again. An up and coming intern convinced the management he could solve the problem by implementing a forum. Resources were allocated, and he spent the next few weeks setting up phpBB. Hopefully you can see where this is going.<p>The tedium of checking forum threads soon wore on the jaded developers. Nobody wanted to root through non-threaded, disorganized responses, or update the attached Wiki. Soon, the server turned into a forgotten wasteland.<p>Computing problems are solved with computers. Human problems are solved by good leaders. Sometimes, computers can help. Although the forum didn&#x27;t work, a new developer was hired as I was switching jobs, and was doing a marvelous job uniting the development team. Before I left, a Jabber server was setup in place of the forum. The reception was much better--but the real problem solver was a good leader. Not the computer.",1417245149

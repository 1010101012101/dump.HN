10973662,comment,10972482,10972482,0,0,nothis,,,"That old topic. Ironically, I find people who work with math (<i>chosen</i> to work with math, that is) to probably be quite unqualified to truly understand the problem. He opens by saying that learning avoiding mistakes before any bigger concepts is a major root of this but then again, people <i>do</i> make mistakes in math (even math professors) and it&#x27;s a field where any mistake can completely invalidate the work. Also most people learn math for practical uses rather than as a science or field of research which also gives a different perspective (for most people, it&#x27;s more important in life to not drop a zero when calculating a bill than it is to understand, say, a Homomorphism).<p>Math simply is hard. It goes against all our good-enough, subconscious brain functions we use every day to make basic &quot;bigger or smaller&quot; decisions. The problems mathematicians call &quot;interesting&quot; are counter-intuitive pretty much by definition and now imagine someone thinking like that writing a math book for children. The language used is vast and was built over literally <i>millennia</i> of mathematicians appending their own little modifiers above, below, and all around other mathematical symbols, resulting in monstrosities like the function for the Fourier Transformation which can actually be described quite intuitively geometrically.<p>Mathematicians want &quot;simplicity&quot; and &quot;beauty&quot; but their definition of either is absurdly different from any that would take into account basic human intuition. That&#x27;s the problem. And there barely are any mathematicians that would admit that this could ever be a bad thing.",1453820390

There is nothing that prevents someone who is consideered dangerous to be kept in prison longer.<p>Second: Those who are kept the longest behind bars are those who are sentenced to psychiatric treatment (It&#x27;s actually odd that you <i>can</i> be sentenced to psychicatric treatment, but you can in many european countries). That is essentially &quot;you&#x27;ll get out when you are no longer dangerous to yourself or others&quot;, which in many cases can be much longer than even the longest prison sentences. Many mass murderes and similar will be in this category.<p>Third: the idea behind short sentences is diminishing returns, the responsibility of the system to reform the convicted (if they fail it&#x27;s their fault) and perhaps most of all - econonomic reasons. Unless I see concrete evidence that longer sentences are actually cost effective for keeping me safer, I&#x27;m not going to allow politicians to make such laws.<p>Cost effectiveness is key. One can&#x27;t just argue that longer sentences automatically makes the streets safer, since it costs a lot. You have got to compare, dollar for dollar, with the effect spending the same money on (for example) Police, Drug treatment, Education, Job creation, ...<p>So the fundamental assumption is not that all criminals will reform, but that most will, others will at least reform enough to not be <i>dangerous enough that the cost of keeping them in prison is worth it to society - the money can be better spent elsewhere</i>.",1453819972

As the paper shows, even for an extremely simple data set where there is merely a non-linear coding error, the coefficient can be very statistically significant (t-stat magnitude > 2) and yet <i>it will have the wrong sign.</i><p>This is a really remarkable thing. By just jittering your data a bit, you can obtain a result that passes the usual, simplistic significance tests but for which the effect size <i>is negative when it should be positive</i> (or vice versa).<p>I remember when I worked in quant finance and we were using a terrible, shamefully bad automated framework for frequentist model fitting, the sense of dread was huge. If the data we used had been jittered by the data vendor, or if there was a slight bug in the code that did variable cleaning, outlier manipulation, or scoring, or any of a hundred other steps where tiny non-linearities could be introduced, then it would be entirely possible for us to see &quot;significant&quot; results that pointed in the opposite direction from the truth.<p>There are many other papers which point out the pitfalls of naive dump-it-all-on-the-right-hand-side regression models, but I think this one from Achen is unique in that it is extremely short, extremely simple to follow, and yet it is fully devastating to this entire technique of modeling.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.columbia.edu/~gjw10/achen04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbia.edu/~gjw10/achen04.pdf</a>",1453818936

What happens to markets when the legal monopoly stops selling?<p>Now consumer electronics is a field where there&#x27;s a lot of motion.

(In fact, automatic theorem-provers do exist, but I would not recommend their use.)\n</code></pre>\nI think interactive theorem provers would go a long way towards making children understand symbolic reasoning.\nThe way these programs work is that you have feedback available at every step of a proof.\nChildren can learn basic causal relationships by looking at the world around them.\nBy visualizing the basic relationships between logical formulae you can similarly learn to inuit the effects of reasoning steps.\nInteractive theorem provers provide the visualization.<p>The game has rules, and you can learn them.",1453817934

In particular, the ability of US companies to defer taxation on profits made abroad until they are repatriated. Effectively, these profits sit in limbo since they aren&#x27;t taxable by the country in which they are &#x27;made&#x27; (e.g Ireland) because they belong to a US company. Companies then apply pressure on politicians to announce tax amnesties that enable them to repatriate the profits with negligible tax.<p>Blaming all of the above on other countries by casting them as tax havens is a complete charade. The US could fix this problem today on its own if it wanted to.\nIt just needs to get its house in order and e.g. get rid of the deferral rules.

They work by indiscriminately increasing serotonin levels in the synapse, thereby activating every single serotonin receptor (5-HT).  While you get the anti-depressant effect by increasing the activation at the 5-HT1 receptor, you also get the negative side effects of SSRI&#x27;s since it activates 5-HT2c receptor (weight gain), 5-HT3 receptor (nausea), and sleep issues.<p>The future of the antidepressants lies in chemicals that increase serotonin at the 5-HT1 receptor (lowering depression) without affecting the other receptors.  Drugs like mirtazipine and nefazodone attempt to do this by blocking certain 5-HT receptors (mainly the 5-HT2a receptor, which lowers anxiety), and as a result make serotonin levels higher and more available at the 5-HT1 receptor.  That&#x27;s the reason these 2 drugs in particular don&#x27;t have the nasty side-effects of SSRI&#x27;s.<p>The future of anti-depressants likely lies in the ability to find a drug that increases activation at the 5-HT1 receptors in certain parts of the brain, while leaving the rest of the brain and receptors untouched.",1453817741

You get auto-complete, indentation, compile-on-save, type checking right within your editor with less than 5 lines of configuration.<p>For someone new to the type system, it helps a lot to compulsively keep checking the types of the expressions as you go along building the program.

If it were that simple, it would not have remained an issue since schools were commonplace.<p>Minsky solidly makes the point that when math is taught as nothing more than an endless series of tedious drills with no purpose in sight, of course it demotivates kids. No one likes pointless Sisyphean tasks.<p>Many students, however, &quot;rediscover&quot; math when they get to their first class that involves theorems and proofs (often in high-school geometry) and when it starts being used in science coursework. It is then that they realize that math is a way of thinking and this can transform their opinion and motivation for math.<p>The best teachers find ways to relate mathematics to real life and real purpose. Yeah, it is always going to be challenging, but having a purpose creates motivation to get through the tedium.",1453816903

I applaud the president for looking into an issue that is traditionally ignored by leaders in the US- the effects of our prison system on the population. I wish he hadnt stopped at solitary confinement. Our entire prison system and matrix of crime->sentencing needs to have a complete overhaul to remove the drug bias on sentences. Repeat violent offenders need to be kept off the streets. Drug users need help, not incarceration.<p>I also wish he hadn&#x27;t taken credit for reducing crime. I think that this has almost nothing to do with the president. Its very easy to cherry pick the statistics you like and claim responsibility. Would he also like to take responsibility for the continuing/increase in violence against citizens by the police? The violations of civil liberties? Anyway, I hope that this starts building momentum that we need to change our prison system. I think some of the policing issues will start to work themselves out as different socio economic groups see that cops aren&#x27;t there to harass and arrest, and that drug users may be able to get help.",1453816900

Are the big corporations going to accept this or are the going to lobby their asses off to stop it.
If they do and they win then we will most likely have another massacre of the rich and greedy.
Seems World War 3 is inevitable if corporations are going to fight this. Hope nobody uses the nukes or we&#x27;re all screwed.",1372067988

I&#x27;m stating what current &quot;mainstream&quot; economic thinking has been doing.<p>><i>Government expenditures aren&#x27;t decreasing or being cut back massively: they&#x27;re consistently rising, year on year. This isn&#x27;t merely some artefact of Democratic administrations (which are hardly anomalies and can&#x27;t be ignored anyway), because even the Ryan budget included year on year increases, albeit at a slower rate (that didn&#x27;t keep pace with medical inflation, for better or for worse).</i><p>That is very true! But the prices of commodities and other equities is going up faster, while wages and salaries have been stagnant for decades (gas for example when I was a kid in the 90s was around a dollar, now its 4x that). We can automate all the things in the world, but if the masses can&#x27;t afford them without massively leveraging themselves to the point they can&#x27;t make payments (or without refinancing their houses), the economy isn&#x27;t going to do any better.<p>Printing money and giving it to people and expecting things to be stable is like trying to make two sides of an equation balance out by adding more to one side than the other, it&#x27;s just inherently unstable. In markets, if consumers have more to spend on things they supposedly need, then sellers will be incentivized to raise their prices on their goods. Boom, your printing just did jack shit for stability. My IB friends talk to me about this all the time just look at corporate balance sheets vs the DOW (can you say POMO?)<p>Until the value of things robots will be manufacturing is closer to the range where people can actually afford to buy them (and meet their needs comfortably), you will only see things getting worse.<p>Until then, my crystal ball is for CDS backed by securities student loans/housing/faltering governments and municipalities, Defense Distributed/3-d printing/urban-ag, and cheap valuable land, and writing code to integrate these things",1372067137

Today, I could probably criticise every single line of it...<p>So - here are my lessons - maybe someone will find them useful (keep in mind this is C code for attiny chip - it&#x27;s really minimal stuff):<p><pre><code>    signed short int P[P_NUM]={0};      // real points
    unsigned short int A[P_NUM]={0};        // meas points
</code></pre>
Never name global variables with single letters. Even these are &quot;the&quot; global variables everything else in the code uses. Also comments do not have character limit - if it&#x27;s &quot;measured points&quot;, spell it out. It&#x27;s useful for grepping.<p><pre><code>    unsigned char last=0; // last point+1
</code></pre>
I have no idea what +1 means at this point, since it starts at 0. Was the last point -1? I don&#x27;t think so - again, always add details to comments.<p><pre><code>    if(lcd_buff[j]&_BV(i))
        PORT_LED|=_BV(PIN_AB);
    else
        PORT_LED&=~(_BV(PIN_AB));
    PORT_LED|=_BV(PIN_CLK);
    PORT_LED&=~(_BV(PIN_CLK));
</code></pre>
Horizontal whitespace matters - code above is barely readable. Defines for constants are good, but could be more descriptive than &quot;PIN_AB&quot;. At least PIN_CLK is self-explanatory.<p><pre><code>    eeprom_busy_wait(); eeprom_write_byte((uint8_t *) 0x00+1, last);
    eeprom_busy_wait(); eeprom_write_word((uint16_t *)(2+setup_pos*4), A[setup_pos]);
    eeprom_busy_wait(); eeprom_write_word((uint16_t *)(4+setup_pos*4), P[setup_pos]);
</code></pre>
If some function repeats so often that you end up prepending it before &quot;actual work&quot;, you&#x27;re probably missing a level of abstraction.<p><pre><code>    a*=2;
    a/=dif;
    if(a&1)
        a++;
    a/=2;
</code></pre>
Even if some code is specific to that project and crucial to the way it works - comment on &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot;. I guess it tries to round the division... but it could be a lot clearer.<p><pre><code>    //#define CORRECT(a,b) ((A[b]-A[a])/(P[b]-P[a]))
    //#define CORRECT2(a,b) ((A[b]-A[a])/(P[b]-P[a])>>1)
</code></pre>
Never comment out unneeded code. Delete it and let the version control keep the old things. Now I&#x27;m not sure if that was commented out for testing, or was it never needed...<p>Also found out that any in-line state machine will grow until it fills the memory (not hard on attiny ;) ). If you don&#x27;t design proper macros to construct it, it will become a single function with lots and lots of copy-paste code. It doesn&#x27;t matter that it was clear at the start and only had 4 states that fit on the screen. Code grows on it&#x27;s own :)<p>Also I found a CVS folder in that project. There&#x27;s one issue with it - I only have the client part - so I can&#x27;t see any history anymore. DVCSs are a really cool idea.<p>And for the end -> writing code for a very small chip doesn&#x27;t mean you have to make the code itself really short, but somehow it seems I was trying to do that. It&#x27;s the resulting binary that is supposed to be small. Keep in mind how separated are you from the end-result.",1372066485

They even park it right there, right next to where they have their picnic. Odd but understandable. In Europe cars are antithetical to nature and relaxation, something industrial you hide out of sight, while in the US they are (apparently) integral to it.<p>Hours. In the US/SF people &#x27;like&#x27; to be in the office. It is practically their home when they are not commuting or sleeping. While on the weekends they go on trips to be away from home/the office (I could not imagine raising, rather than merely producing, a family in the US).<p>(all you say about the weather is true, unless you live in West SF. National parks are fabulous indeed!)<p>Poverty. Without being a Republican who believes the poor / racial minorities are to blame for their own d*mned fate, it is not possible to enjoy central San Francisco. Never seen so many homeless people in such horrible states of existence (and I am not a Republican but a social democrat, so I was not comfortable with US society...).<p>(the US is this odd mix between rich and modern and a 3rd world country... also with regard to infrastructure)<p>Traffic lights (and a lot of traffic) at almost every corner in the city. Perhaps nice if you are driving, but very annoying when you want to enjoy an uninterrupted walk.<p>Grid-pattern (mostly responsible for the former). Cities look like they were built on a chess-board. Nice if you want to go straight, but not good when you want to go diagonal (in Paris they solved this with diagonal avenues). And forget building diversity or atmosphere, especially in the suburbs (which are 97% of the city).<p>Houses are indeed quite flimsy. But in East SF there are at least some lovely pre-war houses that have atmosphere (I lived in a room in one, loved it...).<p>Business / startup opportunities; indeed, nothing beats California (never seen so many things bordering on the silly, fully funded...).<p>On balance, after a year in the US, I chose to go back to the old world when a great opportunity came up there. I&#x27;m a European again :)",1372066226

E.g. maybe, the people who sue McDonalds don&#x27;t want their neighbor becoming rich while they are poor. This of course is not limited to the poor; this is a human thing. I would argue that it is not in Warren Buffett&#x27;s self interest to vote for higher taxes; then again that is my opinion and is not necessarily the same as his.

That is, the best way to do it is to inspire via other subjects that will enliven the entire career.<p>I&#x27;m a highly skilled software engineer who was an English and Classics major at at top liberal arts college. The author of the article seems to be an authority, but he is not. Most professors of literature that I respect would look down on his attempt to generalize about the whole field based on a narrow non-fiction / writing practioner-esque approach.<p>The reason you study English is to study literature which is the most important concentration of knowledge, distilled, evolved and selected as to what is important in the past several centuries. There is figuratively nothing actually more important (if there were, someone would&#x27;ve written a f-ing story). Science, by comparison, is young.<p>The study of literature is a celebration of what is important in life. And how to live life. And how to find what is important to you in terms of each second that you live on this planet, Steve Jobs / death at your back philosophically-speaking (those are all English majory ideas -- Marvell in that case).<p>But back to my original point. One studies computer science to understand the philosophy of how computers might be designed and used (see the Abelson SICP lectures or whatever), not to learn how to implement some Java standard interface. Though that is a little part of the practice that one has to do. Same thing with writing.<p>I took zero writing courses, but wrote over a hundred essays on other writers and it was one of the best preparations for any field -- law, science, software engineering (in my case).<p>Also the proper way to study literature -- ignoring all the postmodernist and cultural theory baggage -- is to study words closely and this has a long, rigorous history that again rivals any other analytical tradition. Has English studies lost its way? Sure, it always does because it&#x27;s such a ridiculously large undertaking. Are more targeted philologies and close readings (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_reading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_reading</a> ) important? Sure.<p>But just because the typical English major isn&#x27;t as employable without other skills, doesn&#x27;t mean the field itself is a bad one. But I think people get upset about it because it is such a tricky field to make a career in and can burn you if you think it is.<p>But one doesn&#x27;t set out to become an astronaut by taking astronaut classes. You have to have another broader drive. Among those who value intelligence, however, the study of literature (f- writing --  great writing has no place in the university except as a place to study it, if you ask me -- it&#x27;s not primarily designed to teach writing in the world because academia does not exist primarily in the world -- it&#x27;s designed to teach understanding of past writing which is precisely &#x27;what we know&#x27;, as Eliot would say, etc.).<p>Anyway, as much as it pains me to give any credence to the idiots there:<p><a href=""http://www.socfell.fas.harvard.edu/senior%20and%20junior%20fellows.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.socfell.fas.harvard.edu/senior%20and%20junior%20f...</a><p>They know enough to know that English is equal to many other pursuits of knowledge.

Because information cannot travel faster than the speed of light, c, our observable universe is limited to an apparent 13.7 billion light years, although the furthest objects we can see have since moved further away. Its mass is limited by the gravitational constant, G, to a value that prevents the universe from collapsing on itself.<p>A complete description of the universe could therefore consist of a description of the exact positions and velocities of a finite number (about 10^80) of particles. But quantum mechanics limits any combination of these two quantities to discrete multiples of Planck&#x27;s constant, h. Therefore the universe, and everything in it, must have a finite description length. The entropy in  nats (1 nat = 1/ln(2) bits = 1.4427 bits) is given by the  Bekenstein bound as 1/4 of the area of the event horizon in  Planck units of area hG/2c3, a square of 1.616 x 10^-35 meters on a side. For a sphere of radius Tc = 13.7 billion light years, the bound is 2.91 x 10^122 bits.<p>We now make two observations. First, if the universe were divided into regions the size of bits, then each volume would be about the size of a proton or neutron. This is rather remarkable because the number is derived only from T and the physical constants c, h, and G, which are unrelated to the properties of any particles. Second, if the universe were squashed flat, it would form a sheet about one neutron thick. Occam&#x27;s Razor, which the computability of physics makes true, suggests that these two observations are not coincidences.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not qualified enough to find the possible error but I consider that  speculation intriguing!",1372064543

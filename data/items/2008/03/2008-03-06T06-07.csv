Do you feel you cannot sustain such growth? I would say take those profits re-invest in yourself and try to reach targets that will warrant a better buyout.",1204785894

If they don't, I don't think there's a concept of an error bar here.  They track how many people go to what sites.  Aside from a few dropped packets here or there, there is no uncertainty in that measurement.    Therefor, there is no way to measure that sort of error bar.  (Right?)",1204785514

No one is willing to take your idea sight-unseen, but people will do it for real money on rentacoder--if you're willing to put your money where you mouth is.<p>Imagine I told you I had a secret that would make you 100 MILLION dollars. I'll tell you the secret, but it will cost you $10,000 to learn it. I'm thinking you wouldn't bother. Why? Because the real value of the secret in this kind of asymmetric exchange is only apparent after it has been shared, so the deal never happens. In the back of your head, wouldn't you also be wondering why I didn't use the secret to make myself 100 million and why I'm so concerned with $10,000 if I have a secret worth so much?<p>I have a folder of over 40 of my ideas I don't have time to get to and so your idea would have to win out over the alternatives, but it can't beat the alternatives for anyone if you never share it.<p>Perhaps its most valuable as a story when you're older about  ""the one that got away.""",1204784992

130373,comment,130228,130228,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Hmm. At your current position I would seriously consider the lifestyle options you currently have. How much are you earning currently from this? Are you the only founder? If you can take a 6 figure salary from this and still pay all business expenses and be profitable then I would reconsider selling, especially at such a low valuation.*<p>*Quick note/question: You're saying that you hit 160K net profit last month, and that you're being offered 3-4 times earnings. Depending on your gross margins you're being offered at least $7.7M (assuming no change in monthly net profit). What are your earnings, might we ask?<p>If you have very tight margins (<10%) then I think this is a great deal, technology and speculation aside. If you have a high margin (>50%) then it probably isn't such a great deal.<p>Things to consider:<p>- How much of the buyout goes to you?<p>- How much are you personally making now?<p>- The average American (depending on education) earns about $3M in his/her entire lifetime. Will you have this or more after the deal? (This is a little test I apply to see if I would do or not do something).<p>- How risky is your company?<p>- How much risk are you willing to take?<p>Good luck with this. Congratulations for getting this far!",1204784566

They have resources, but if they're just now starting to figure out what to do ... I know exactly what to do, but ... kinda hard to do it.

OOOORRR - you just gave me another idea in a way: What if I go up to BigCo and <i>THREATEN</i> to publish it online for free, thus rendering their money spent on research/subsequent patent-based revenue streams completely useless?  Just walk up to IBM and say, ""I know what you guys researching, here's what you'll discover, now pay up or I'll write a white paper and just put it on the internet ... or mail it to Microsoft or whatever!""<p>And since the legal departments of most major corporations use game theory in analyzing transactions, their lawyers would easily tell them it's in their favor to pay me what I ask for just to get me to agree to shut up.<p>That's just crazy enough to possibly work.

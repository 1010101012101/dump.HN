The book was wrong; they hadn't labelled a diagram but were asking for those labels in the answers.<p>Maybe some children would have worked out to create their own key or to write in the book, but this boy just stopped.  An activity that he's good[2] at, that he enjoys, is being slowly poisoned by poor quality materials.<p>It's not just math books either.

If you have it, they'll see it, but you've gotta have a product to show off and you have to speak confidently to where you're taking it and how.

When he asked me for help, my first instinct was to help him find the relevant information in his textbook.  But the textbook wasn't helpful at all. First, he was often working with things that weren't indexed; even though his homework was from the textbook's supplemental materials.  Then, the text was hard to understand. It just wasn't written very well.  Finally, the whole thing was just too busy, with many different fonts, all sorts of margin notes, many footnotes, and colored boxes surrounding text. This made finding information harder and just gave me a headache.",1330278979

It's trivially easy to end up with a ""updated"" field that updates anyways, or other side effects, in which case neither PUT nor PATCH make sense.<p>In a good majority of API cases the correct method <i>is</i> POST, even for so-called updates. Because, generally speaking, it is the controller that decides what happens to state when processing the request in Rails and if and when there will be side effects. Unless you can be certain the <i>client</i> will decide 100% of the result of the state PUT and even PATCH are just not <i>technically</i> correct.<p>PATCH is arguably better suited than PUT here but again why the strict adherence to one or the other for updates, when quite possibly neither is correct. Why PATCH by default? Why not just POST by default, PATCH/PUT where they make sense?

Another friend was contacted for a PhD software engineer position, and even though he had told the HR person that he was also interviewing for another company, he had time to go through the whole interview process with the other company (consisting on several meetings), and by the time he had an offer, Google still hadn't had the phone interview with him.<p>I'm just saying that I had the impression that the hiring system isn't not amongst the best ones out there, but I have big respect for how the company works.<p>Specifically, I think it's great, for example, that they aren't afraid of trying a million things and shut them down when they're not happy. Most companies are afraid of switching and are extremely slow at making any decent change.<p>But so, just to understand if you want to say something about it, do you really interview a person without a position? Just for the whole company? Or do you mean that if the candidate is good you say 'hire, but for a different position'? Or do you mean something else?<p>Thanks!",1330277573

Is it ok for companies to utilize mass scale labor at what becomes in reality a sub minimum wage rate?

However, if you're doing it full time, I call bullshit on that difference. If you had 100,000 people working on mechanical turk 40 hours per week, making $6 per hour, those are very much jobs paying sub minimum wage.<p>It would be no different than if a thousand companies banded together to source labor below minimum wage by paying per task, and sharing that labor around rather than employing each laborer in a ""job"" (eg in a metro area with high population density). Those companies would be paying for net full time labor, while evading the minimum wage responsibility.<p>One solution to this legal boundary, would be to require that mechanical turk style tasks pay at least equivalent to minimum wage based on the time they take.

The result has been that startups often focus (in fact, they are strongly advised to focus - for example in numerous blog posts that are widely popular here on HN) on ideas that can generate market value within a couple of years.

Obviously, I beat RSI (mostly), and still code to this day.  Observations:<p>1) Avoid long-term use of NSAIDs: initially they work but ultimately they make you feel crappy, possibly because they do something to your liver causing your liver enzymes to rise.<p>2) Ice, ice, baby: A key aspect of the cure for me was submerging my forearms in icewater for 10 minutes daily until they became mostly numb.  They were inflamed, and cold (though above freezing) is about the only anti-inflammatory with no really negative side-effects<p>3) Lose the mouse, lose the laptop: I use a logitech trac-ball now (though that penclic pen looks tempting) and a really big screen.  If I want to revisit my pain, all I need to do is use a mouse for a couple days or try to use a laptop to be productive.  Strangely, touchscreen tablets are fine.  This tends to run head-on into the insane focus on laptops at tech companies these days.<p>4) Yes, it does seem like part of the problem is in your head:  I hate hate hated my job in 2004 but I needed the money.  I changed that in 2006 and started knocking everything out of the park.  That's right about the time the symptoms gradually went away.  Also, I started hitting the gym again and lifting weights despite the pain (losing the 15 lbs I had gained during the experience).  It seems like once there's been a long-term physical trauma, one's awareness gets rewired to focus on it despite it being mostly healed and then the only way out is to deny its existence to the best of one's abilities.<p>5) I've become acutely aware of how many extraneous mouse motions and button presses exist right now and that's a real sore point with me.<p>Stuff that didn't work: yoga, rolfing (felt nice though), acupuncture (except for one time I needed to get something out by a deadline and one needle blocked the pain long enough to get there), various alternative mice and keyboards (Dvorak touchstreams and Kinesis were awful for me), and supplements (though I suspect more Omega-3s might have helped had I known about them)",1330276176

I needed clients, and most clients were bloody rich company owners. I had to fake I was one of them, after a lot of faking, I became one. I had to buy a new car every few months. I had boxes and boxes of clothes I used twice. I live 8 hours of flight away from NYC and I would travel there on weekends to buy clothes, cheesecakes of have lunch with ""investors"".<p>Then the banking crisis came. We almost crashed, we managed to survive but the social pressure on us was so great that I burned out. I took some time off and went to Railsconf, going back to my programming roots. The last expensive car I have is actually being sold tomorrow. I was talking to my wife about living close to the office so I could just walk to work.<p>After burning out I quit all managing roles in my company and I'm just a developer there.

I would also assume that piracy is not necessarily uniform, something popular with a younger more tech savvy audience would be more likely to be pirated (I assume at least).<p><i>Sure, that's why I support both going to live shows and buying.

Not sure why this should particularly be different, you need some method of enforcement otherwise you would be essentially running an honesty system. Very few other industries can exist purely on what would essentially be donations so not sure why IP should be different.<p><i>Can you give me some examples?</i><p>Sure , Movies (although I suppose you could count cinema as performance) , video games and pretty much all software.

For example say you write and record a song and a large company with more resources than you decides to take your song and have somebody else perform it and they make serious money doing this do they owe you anything?<p>Or if they decide to host your work on a website with adverts (essentially what TPB did/does) do you have any right to a portion of that ad revenue?",1330275950

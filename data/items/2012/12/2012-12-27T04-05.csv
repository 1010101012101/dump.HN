4972395,comment,4972068,4972314,3,0,spankalee,,,"Thanks for the sarcasm, but I'm not sure your points stand.<p>* Readability can be somewhat subjective. Neither Coffekup or any of the markup DSLs I've seen are inarguably much more readable than HTML. A few extra braces to closing tags do not immediately make something less readable to me, and the example given does not seem like a clean win to me. Better in some cases, worse in others, a wash overall.<p>* I do not think ""portability"" means what you think it does. Coffeekup appears to only run under Coffeescript. That makes it rather un-portable. Many other template languages have multiple implementations in many languages. That seems unlikely with Coffeekup.<p>* Reducing formatting errors would presumably be because of static syntax errors caught by a Coffeescript-aware editor, and dynamic errors caught by the Coffeescript compiler and JS runtime. The same is achieved with a HTML-aware editor and various available validators.<p>* I don't see how Coffeekup that generates HTML is easier to learn than just HTML.<p>* Or screw up the hierarchy because of whitespace errors. This is just the significant-whitespace debate brought to markup. If you want significant whitespace for your markup, I'm sure there are portable template languages with significant whitespace.",1356584328

The first shop they gave us the whole spiel about the 5 C's etc.  They had my wife try on this ungodly large diamond ring she would never wear.  We thanked them and left.  Went to another store, saw a few in our price range and we left with it that day.<p>Now that method isn't for everybody, some of my wife's friends thought it was pathetic I brought her along and had her choose, others thought it was a good idea.  Generally those were the ones who were married and were upset at the ring their husband bought.<p>But at least in my opinion the ring is specific to the girl.  Some want big diamonds, others like my wife feel uncomfortable with one.  She wanted a fancier cut than others in that price range though.  And don't forget there is more to the ring than just the diamond.  The band is important too(Another reason to have her go with you.  Instant sizing.)  Diamonds are hard to buy online because the way the light hits the diamond is important to its look and again, every girl has a different look she wants.",1356584087

If one of my top engineers wants to leave and there's a chance that I can get him to stay by offering him a decent raise ... then I'm going to try to give him a raise after thinking through a couple of things<p>1. Did the ground shift underneath me overnight in terms of engineer salaries? This can happen very easily ... a couple of startups move into town and start trying to poach devs ... guess what, salaries are going to go up and if you don't play, you're going to lose your best guys. that one engineer leaving might just be the beginning of half of your team coming to you going ""Hey man, these guys just offered me $140k ... you guys are paying me $95k ...""<p>2. What does this guy mean to the team ... and not just in cranking out high quality code? What would the effect of his departure on morale be. If he's very well liked and looked up to as a mentor/leader by younger developers, I'm inclined to try and come up with something to get him to say.<p>That being said, I'm not a fan of trying to do an exact match, just because, it feels too much like being held hostage. What I'd do is try to find out what they like about the new offer so much and see what I can do ... things like health insurance, shares, flex time and even process changes seem to get far more mileage out of developers than cold cash. I'd try to put together a package for them (with increased salary of course).<p>If that got them to stay. I'd re-evaluate the current package of my entire team and see about extending the same deal to everybody, to (hopefully) pre-empt another situation like this in the near future. That way, if I got another engineer wanting to leave, then I know that there isn't that much more I can do to get them to stay.<p>PS: Learn to be distrustful of the the words ""always"" and ""never"" ... because in real life its usually more like ""it depends""",1356583435
4972367,comment,4971789,4972324,1,0,pooriaazimi,,,"I have to disagree. I didn't mean that Mail.app ""shows stuff"" faster because it's cached the data and there's no roundtrip to the server (BTW, Gmail.app does this too). I meant the animations, scrolling and general speed with which ""things"" happen after you touch something or swipe.<p>And as I said, even if HTML5 rendering gets 40% faster, it's still extremely slow compared to native UIKit stuff. HTML5 is like 3 times slower than UIKit if you have any animation (and by animation, I don't mean really fancy stuff even - even moving a rounded rectangle from point A to point B).<p>It's not this drastic on Android, but iOS's graphics stack has been heavily optimized so <i>a lot of</i> stuff happens in layers in GPU. UIWebView, because of its implementation, does (almost) all its renderings in CPU and almost by definition, is much, much slower than anything that's GPU-accelerated (and takes at least 50% more memory and power).<p>The difference is like night and day. Open Gmail.app in iPhone 4S or 5 (the new Gmail.app that was released a few weeks ago is faster than previous versions though), and open Mail.app in an iPhone 3G. You'll see the difference clearly.",1356583390

Write your own ""cp"". Handle some errors, add some options. Try out fread(3)/fwrite(3), then try read(2)/write(2).<p>Then write ""mv"" and do the same. Now make it fast within a filesystem. Or work across filesystems (depending on your first implementation).<p>Then write an encryption or compression program.<p>Now write a simple library, make a red/black tree. Store ints first, but then later, store generic objects (design your API carefully!). Make two iterators, one using a callback and one using a next() function. Decide which you like better.<p>About now you may start to find your development environment lacking, do you use Make? Autotools? Something else? Go learn one and update your old projects to use it. While you're at it, write some tests for them. Did you handle command line options for your version of ""cp""? Did you use getopt_long(3)? Might be a good idea. Oh by the way, does it support ""-R""? Hmm...and your tree isn't reentrant either, better go learn about pthread locks.<p>After a while, you should start learning some other libraries (because you want to do real work): curl, libxml, sqlite (hey these are in that book!). Study their code, their build systems, their test harnesses (oh man, especially sqlite's) and incorporate the ideas you like into your own work. Use them to build something cool, maybe a web crawler or whatever.<p>Do you like music? Learn an audio library and make something. From here, you should direct yourself to what you like building, because you probably have enough tools to do the learning on your own.<p>HTH",1356581436

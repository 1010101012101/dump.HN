870187,comment,868325,870180,0,0,Shooter,,,"That all said, here is how I found ""the doctor"":<p>1.  I was persistent.  I saw lots of doctors.  The 22 number I mention in my post is mostly just the <i>specialists</i> I saw - not even all the general practitioners I visited.<p>2.  If I were to rank the doctors I saw, the better ones were either members of IFM (functional medicine), they were DOs (shady origins, but a more holistic viewpoint), and/or they were internal med doctors.  Rheumatologists only seem capable of seeing certain things.  Neurologists only seem to see certain things.  In general, specialists were unable to see or care beyond their specialty.  Which, I guess, is somewhat understandable.  [The specialists did find clues, however, like the lesions and the hormone issues that eventually helped me find the underlying cause.]<p>3.  I asked around for someone who had a good reputation as a diagnostician.  I asked doctors, business leaders, and hospital administrators.  Unfortunately, many doctors seem to pride themselves on their amazing diagnostics skills, whether they actually possess them or not.  So, I also asked for ""open-minded"" and ""compassionate.""  Compassion implies a good listener, which is probably the most important thing because you can't find a pattern if you didn't hear about it.  Some of the worst doctors I visited were the famous ones.  They were too busy to listen.  IIRC, I think the final diagnosing doctor had been trained at a podunk med school in Cuba or something.<p>4.  I was an informed patient.  I used to work in the medical field (piss-collector, clinical drone, researcher, and software developer.) I researched extensively on my own. (This can backfire for some people, because they develop cyber-hyperchondria.) In any case, I knew - or learned enough - to get a lay of the medical landscape and I used that to my advantage.<p>5. I kept a 'journal' that listed what symptoms I had on what day, etc. - it helped me find patterns. Some organisms have a specific lifecycle, so that helped me in my own search.  Sometimes the only pattern was that there was no pattern, but the journal exercise was still very helpful.  Just be careful about looking like a nutjob if you carry a handwritten book of your woes into a doctor's office.<p>6.  I was an inpatient patient.  I know doctors are just average schmucks like the rest of us and they make mistakes, because I've worked with them.  So, if a doctor didn't listen or was a jerk, I never went back.  Some people think doctors are holy or something, and they continue going to visit a jackass in the hopes that something will change.  That can kill you.  That tendency is especially prevalent in older people.<p>7.  I acted professionally when dealing with doctors.  Enough of them thought that I was nuts that I didn't need to confirm their suspicions by acting too emotional or unreasonable.  Even though I <i>was</i> often emotional, I kept it under wraps.<p>8. I tried to find doctors that kept up on the latest research, or that at least seemed to <i>care</i> about new research and treatments.  To be honest, I knew more about the most current medical studies than <i>any</i> doctor I visited, including the final diagnosing physician.  I was more motivated and I had more time on my hands.  But I used my knowledge to separate out the doctors who read the bare minimum for their CEs from the ones that were genuinely interested in their field and read broadly for their own benefit.<p>9.  To restate an above point: I never brought up <i>my</i> ideas about what I had until I gave the doctors a chance to give me their ideas, because I didn't want to bias them.  I had to remain open-minded too.  You may not like the answer you get, but if there is compelling proof about it you have to accept it.<p>10.  Read and know your insurance policy if you're in the US, and fight for your rights.",1255042754

870180,comment,868325,868925,0,0,Shooter,,,"I feel some people are focusing on the wrong thing, most likely because of my poor presentation.  I'll try to answer your question, but I also want to elaborate a bit:<p>In relaying my story, I kind of 'cast' the diagnosing physician(1) as the hero, in part because it was such a relief to me for someone to finally listen and think logically, because it was relief to me to finally have an answer...and also because I was trying to shorten the post.  But remember, by the time I saw this doctor, I had my condition narrowed down to a couple things already, and one of my guesses <i>was correct</i>.  A search engine could have had equal billing, diagnostically.  This guy didn't have a halo on his head when I found him or a neon sign saying he was ""The One.""  He was <i>not</i> the first person I was told was an amazing diagnostician or ""like House.""  He was just one in a long line of doctors, albeit one of a small number that was compassionate, open-minded and listened.  I never brought up <i>my</i> ideas about what I had until I gave the doctors a chance to give me their ideas, because I didn't want to bias them.  This doctor was just the first one that hit on the actual problem, and was willing to order confirmatory testing.  It was largely odds.  If you see enough doctors, it will probably happen eventually...a million typing monkeys and all that.  The <i>real</i> heroes are the doctors who will actually <i>treat</i> you once your diagnosed, even at great risk to their livelihood.  The real heroes are the ones that will fight the insurance companies and help you while you're <i>going through</i> treatment.<p>The final diagnosis wasn't really magical, or the act of an amazingly brilliant doctor. Yes, having the diagnosis was a psychological relief, but the most important could be this:  the big, insurmountable problem for most people will not be getting a diagnosis but finding - and paying for - a treatment.  There is basically a witch hunt in this country for doctors that diagnose and treat complex diseases.  Complex means expensive, and insurance companies don't like that.  Getting a proper diagnosis can be an enormous problem, but it is often just the start of the journey.<p>(1) Um, I'm getting tons of emails asking for my specific diagnosing doctor's name - which I simply can't give out.  If you have any of these particular diseases, he will not treat you anyway.  Remember, he turned me away.  He would not even <i>start</i> a battle with the insurance companies.  If you have something unusual or that is complex or that is outside of the insurance company parameters, he would send you elsewhere for treatment anyway.",1255042604

870165,comment,869835,869835,0,0,techiferous,,,"As a developer, I take it as a red flag whenever I hear a prospective employer categorically state ""I would never hire a programmer that X.""<p>First of all, it's a heuristic.  If a programmer doesn't program outside of work, it could be that they are not passionate and don't take the time to keep their skills sharp.  It could also be that they are a polymath genius, and simply can't function unless their life is full of a variety of interests.<p>Hiring heuristics are appropriate when there are too many applicants.  For the sake of efficiency, you need some way to narrow down the huge stack of applications.  However, if you are having a hard time finding developers, that's not the time to use heuristics.<p>It tells me something about a prospective employer's problem-solving skills and imagination when they would not consider interviewing someone for a single reason, such as not having a blog.  That's like being a one-issue voter.<p>Also, these heuristics have a way of confirming themselves.  The person who hires only programmers who do X will probably end up finding decent programmers anyway, but they will be oblivious about the ones that got away.",1255041805

870134,comment,869835,869835,0,0,azanar,,,"This post actually presents two premises.<p>The first, that programmer hacking on their own projects, I agree is a very positive indicator. If they don't, it may or may not be a negative indicator, depending on the circumstances. However, I've found the combination of someone who really has the itch to hack in their own time, and that same someone who honestly <i>can't</i> find the time is rare. More often, after enough prodding, they'll admit they just aren't that interested, and that it is ""just a job like any other"".<p>The second, that selecting candidates based upon social connections is an optimal strategy, I approach with some caution. This is not to say that it isn't the best way for raganwald to do things, but I have seen people develop insurmountable confirmation biases simply because someone they know gave a candidate the thumbs up. A lackluster interview performance wasn't enough to overcome this; poor performance once hired wasn't enough either. The trust the hirer puts in their network to suggest the right people <i>must be for the right reasons</i>. This, in a person's profession network, is rather rare. More often, two people knowing one another <i>is</i> the basis for a referral, rather than what the two people know <i>about</i> one another. This works ok in situations where the primary goal is to find a good social fit, but it is like throwing dice when determining if the candidate is capable of performing the required duties. In a lot of cases, both parties just don't care; the referral is a social, not economic or professional, transaction. Luckily for both parties, many companies don't care that much either. Mediocrity is not really affected by the introduction of more mediocrity, so neither party ends up with a tarnished image. This sort of politicing sucks.<p>My perspective on this is much the same as Joel Spolsky's -- or at least the perspective he used to have. If a particular candidate comes pre-recommended by someone, I'm really hesitant to know that. If I'm the person doing the recommending, I always wonder whether I'm doing it because this person is a genuinely good fit, or if I am just feeling the pressure to be a good friend. If I was both introduced to him and one of the one's vetting him, I'd be really concerned that my bias is way too strong for me to make an honest, objective decision. Hiring people based on a blind resume submission sucks, too, and I don't know of any other alternatives. But I worry we have a blind spot to the biases of this method of finding candidates, simply because we want to believe the best in everyone we know.",1255041008

They are a huge source of Usenet spam. I have been kill-filing posts from Google Groups for about a year. It's not a pleasant thing to do, since there still are quite a few people who I like to read but only see quoted in replies now because they use Google Groups.<p>Whenever someone posts the same article 10 times in a row on a Usenet newsgroup, I always look at the mail header, and every single time it is from Google Groups. I don't know what is wrong, but there must be some user interface bug that causes people to resubmit their post. Maybe they don't realize that Usenet has a lag between posting and seeing your post. Maybe there's something wrong with the submit button. I don't know, but I've been seeing this phenomenon for a few years now.<p>Initially, Google Groups made a clear distinction between Usenet newsgroups and Google's own groups, but they've been blurring the two more and more over the years. The result is that a lot of people don't even know they're posting to Usenet, and are unaware of the different etiquette and social customs there (real names, top posting, etc.). Lately they've started including third-party forums as well, so now it's basically a free-for-all, and there is no way to just search Usenet anymore. You have a choice between ""Google Groups"" and ""all groups"", where the latter includes Google Groups, Usenet, <i>and</i> random bulletin boards on the web.<p>If Google isn't interested in supporting Usenet with a decent archive anymore (and I can understand their reluctance, since I'm sure there's little to no money in it) I wish they would pass the responsibility to someone else and get out of the way, because at this point I wish Deja News was still around - I'd have no need for Google Groups anymore.<p>And I know everyone loves to bash on Usenet, about how it's obsolete and dead, but I have to say that at least when it comes to programming language newsgroups, it's still hopping. I follow about a dozen programming newsgroups, and I can't keep up. About once a week I have to ""mark all as read"".

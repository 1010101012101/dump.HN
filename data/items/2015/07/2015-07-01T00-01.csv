How would there be any challenge to its rulings? Without a challenge, how would it be appealed to SCOTUS? Without a public appeal, how would the legal community be able to debate the merits of different cases as they do with other constitutional law issues?<p>It is like if the FBI was doing the bulk collection but never using the data to prosecute anyone: there isn&#x27;t any place for the exclusionary rule* to restrain the prosecution.<p>* this is a good intro for the unfamiliar:

Here is some friendly advice for those of you who were not working in the 90&#x27;s:<p>1) This is HN and a lot of people here have drunk a lot of the start up Koolaid.  I can understand that; especially in the kind of market we have right now.  I should warn you, though, that some day the arbitrary measurements used for evaluating the worth of a startup will change dramatically.  Yes, it seems like crazy talk right now, but some day the startup you work for will be evaluated based on sales, revenue and profitability not by how big your burn rate is, or how &quot;disruptive&quot; your technology is.<p>2) Some day aquisition and IPOs will be difficult and capital for companies without an amazing track record (of making money) will be hard to get.<p>3) There will be a time when stock prices will persistently go down; even if you work for the big amazing company whose shares have made X number of people millionaires.  Some day you will find yourself working for the IBM of the mid 90s or the Microsoft of the early 2000s.  You might even work for a Nortel and have a $100 per share price drop to 0 (as well as losing your job) over a year or two.<p>4) You can over price yourself.  I know that seems stupid because obviously you can just price yourself to the market.  That 30% increase you got from moving to another company can&#x27;t be bad, right?  Until that company tanks because they are paying stupid money to employees and nobody will hire you because you are too expensive.  And when you realize it, and cut your expectations you&#x27;ve been out of a job for 6-8 months and nobody trusts that you can be any good because otherwise, why haven&#x27;t you been snapped up by somebody else?<p>4) You can price yourself into a layoff.  Sure your company is going amazingly well today.  Your company got a $200 million cash infusion just last year, bumping the valuation up to $2 billion.  There are 250 employees and your technology is super-awesomely-disruptive.  But wait... there is a downturn in the market.  Nobody will fund an IPO.  You&#x27;re running out of cash.  No angel investors are showing up and revenue can only handle 100 employees.  Let&#x27;s look at the price/performace ratio of the current employees! Wow, Bob is good but... are we really paying him <i>that</i> much???<p>5) I&#x27;m sorry to say it, but IMHO programmers are not underpaid as a general rule.  Money you don&#x27;t negotiate into your pocket is not &quot;left on the table&quot;.  It&#x27;s not like the money is piling up somwhere.  Money that isn&#x27;t spent on your salary is spent somewhere else.  Companies have slim profits these days and concentrate on growth.  Even large companies tend to tune their profits to about 5% and don&#x27;t even pay dividends!  R&D expenses in a company range from about 2-30%, but often hover in the 10-15% range of expenses.  For a company whose revenue is driven by technology, that means that the 10% activity pays for the other 90% of the company.  <i>Some</i> people are worth the extra 30% pay raise because it <i>will</i> drive the appropriate amount of revenue.  I&#x27;m just going to have to say it, though: most people are not.  If salaries go up 30% across the board, a lot of the companies you work for will tank.  I&#x27;m not saying that <i>you</i> aren&#x27;t worth the 30% extra.  It&#x27;s just that the attitude of &quot;We&#x27;re getting the shaft&quot; is going to kill a lot of companies (as it has done in the past).  There&#x27;s a reason old timers joke about Aeron chairs and foosball tables.<p>These things I have seen and I&#x27;m sure I will see again.",1435712092

9809345,comment,9807326,9807326,0,0,kastnerkyle,,,"One thing which works against the &quot;cite everything&quot; approach is that most of the major conferences have page limits of 8-10 pages with 1 page bonus for references. That means if you go over 1 page of references for (at least NIPS) then you cut into the meat of the paper, reviewers look on in disdain and give poor marks, etc. So you have to actively prune for the most recent and directly relevant citations many times, which sometimes counts out semi-relevant but older work in favor of more relevant recent work.<p>Much of Dr. Schmidhuber&#x27;s work is very interesting and <i>especially</i> relevant now that RNNs are really heating up again - but it is sometimes hard to figure out exactly <i>which</i> of his papers to cite because many are partially relevant. And having a full page of only Schmidhuber citations is no good either...<p>Speaking as a member of the Montreal lab, I am much more up to date with the work that happens here - so it is hard to fight the natural tendency to cite recent papers you know (since they all came from work you know of, cause you were <i>there</i>). Notice too that all 3 (Hinton, LeCun, and Bengio) worked directly together at some point, and collaborated often beyond that. So a version of this is in effect, whereas Juergen has been more separated (both geographically, and work focus wise) than the other 3. NYU Toronto and Montreal are all in an 8 hour triangle!<p>Not to take anything away from his points (I try to cite as many of his papers as possible without seeming ridiculous, generally) but these are the general factors at play. We cannot possibly cite every paper in the field, and shining the light on new works can be more important than citing older work <i>AS LONG AS</i> there is no claiming as a pure innovation work that was already done &quot;in the nineties&quot;.<p>Claiming to improve some technique or take it from curious to usable is more than fine - but given the recent deep learning hype even recent papers are getting overshadowed by others claiming some new innovation which already exists in <i>very current literature</i>.<p>Especially given the work that is coming out of industrial labs (Google, FB, MSR, etc.) it is fairly frequent to see the same model being touted as new (with minor citations if lucky) when the exact same technique first appeared 6 months ago. Being well-read is not an option as an academic - it is a requirement! The PR machine of these companies is unfortunately very effective at dominating the airwaves if you have competing or related work, especially if you are not from a school with good press e.g. MIT, Stanford.",1435711956

One of the more notable ones was the switch from an &quot;intelligent&quot; request routing mechanism (Heroku&#x27;s routing mesh would route requests to dynos based on their load) to a random load-balancing scheme (blind, with no regard for existing dyno load), causing requests to frequently be routed to overworked dynos while leaving open ones idling and twiddling their virtual thumbs.  This change was eventually called out and documented by the folks at Rap Genius [0]; Heroku eventually responded, though I don&#x27;t know off the top of my head whether they went back to their previous (and arguably much-superior) routing system.<p>This, combined with the rather abysmal tooling (and, of course, the rather abysmal pricing) around Heroku, left a bad enough taste in my mouth to avoid Heroku for most (if not all) of my personal projects, the sole exception at the moment being heroku-sucks.herokuapp.com.  My current dayjob employer (a Rails consultancy) has switched away from Heroku entirely, moving instead to Cloud66 (we haven&#x27;t gone the container route yet, but we&#x27;re actively working on it).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://genius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-annotated"" rel=""nofollow"">http://genius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-annotated</a>",1435711690

Compensation certainly isn&#x27;t the only thing that matters to your team, but it is almost always an important factor.

9809173,comment,9808349,9808349,0,0,fi788,,,"This is a topic I studied and really love. After hacking my way into chocolate making, the results were extraordinary. I became a famous chocolate maker in Colombia, was portrayed in magazines and became somehow known in the local gourmet scene. I learned a lot and had a chance to meet wonderful people, all while running an IT-sector company doing CMS and cloud infrastructure development.<p>For the Hacker News crowd, I think the article does well-intentioned but misleading assumptions while not being very encouraging for people to get out and make chocolate. For example, conching is not necessarily required, as is soy lecithin. Domori, a top chocolate maker in Italy does only &#x27;partial conching&#x27; and most artisan chocolate makers have a single process for refining and conching on one machine.<p>If you really want to learn about chocolate making, and doing it on your own, I would definitely recommend these resources:<p>1. Chocolate Alchemy (<a href=""http://www.chocolatealchemy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chocolatealchemy.com/</a>), ran by Jon Nancy. He revolutionized the artisan, small scale chocolate industry by popularizing the use of indian lentil grinders (Santha, Ultra) for grinding cocoa. He sells the cocoa and the machines, and his ingenious solutions for refining, winnowing (removing shell) and tempering are a great reference. When starting out, I actually bought one of these machines in India after visiting a friend. Hacked a computer fan for cooling and opened ventilation holes to avoid overheating. Worked great. Don&#x27;t even get me started on winnowing (husk removal): my household versions ranged from a hair dryer and tumbling beans to a later version with a juice maker connected to a shop vac through complex tubing to control airflow and separate the husk from the bean efficiently.<p>2. The Chocolate Life (<a href=""https://www.thechocolatelife.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thechocolatelife.com/</a>), ran by Clay Gordon is a social network for chocolate makers. The archives are full of input from chocolate makers who later became famous.<p>3. Eat good chocolate. Stores like Chocosphere sell some of the best chocolate online. Fine gourmet stores carry great chocolate. Several brands to try, just look at International Chocolate Award winners for references.",1435709027

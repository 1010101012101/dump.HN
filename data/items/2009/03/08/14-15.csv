Oh right the financial crisis.<p>I don't think more startups translates into more good ideas. Just in more copies and more bad ones. Therefore the cheaper and more plentiful companies get, the more risky they are, and the fewer chances (less funding) really, really good ideas get.<p>But it's fashionable to startup. So a number of people are putting their ""look cool"" money (which is often the same type of money Obama spends : someone else's, and therefore plentiful and worthless to them) into little startups who are very sure to fail.<p>You're heading for a massive bust.",1236524296

507223,comment,507153,507153,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Twice this refers to ""this paper"".  What paper?  If it's referring to itself, then it seems content-free.  If it's another paper, where is it?<p>This seems a complete waste of time, reiterating material that's pretty obvious to a moment's thought.  If I've missed something then I'd be pleased to have it pointed out so I don't feel like I've just wasted five minutes trying to find some value in this.",1236524151

507220,comment,507185,507185,0,0,windsurfer,,,"He says that the software is the problem, but isn't it the hardware (wiimotes) that really differentiate the Wii from the other platforms?<p>I am currently working on a project that uses the wiimotes to get 3D motion tracking for a demo game as well as artists interested in animation. The fact that the wiimotes come with 1024x768 hardware interpolated 100 FPS wireless cameras is something that can be continually improved upon. Does anyone remember Johnny Lee?",1236523790

507218,comment,507172,507172,0,0,nickb,,,"Or it could be as unimportant as Powerset. It's best not to hype it up too much since the odds are that it won't be a panacea to everyone and a lot of people will be disappointed.<p>Products that tend to be modest initially and improve and prove themselves rapidly tend to do better than products that are hyped up beyond all proportions.",1236523732

507214,comment,507172,507172,0,0,TweedHeads,,,"If there is only one answer to one factual question, why not have it already written and available like wikipedia?<p>Practically speaking, static content that doesn't change often is better served by models like wikipedia.<p>If Wolfram knows all the answers, write them all in static html for the world to use, search, browse, replicate and extend instead of stored on semantic databases or ethereal brains.<p>I am not pissing on their parade, I know the scientific work is commendable, but practically speaking it can't compete with more efficient models.",1236523511
507213,comment,507212,507212,0,0,palsecam,,,"(Web) design is hard. For us programmers, it's a pain in the ass, and \nwhen it comes to create UI elements for a (web) app, we are stuck with two\nchoices:<p>1. create something very basic, or<p>2. spend countless hours searching the web for Photoshop tutorials on how to create a bubble or depth \n effect, then spend even-more-countless hours fighting with Photoshop to implement it, and finally, \n maybe adapt the image with some external tools to make it be a CSS sprite or whatever)<p>Yes, 1. is not necessary a bad thing (HN is a good example :-)), but we all \nknow that for most softwares, some attractive eye-candies are useful. Even \n GMail uses more than a simple <i><input type=""button""></i> to display \ntheir buttons.<p>So here comes <i>Da Button Factory</i>. It aims at making it easier to create\npretty buttons, which are one of the key elements of an user interface \n(especially on the web), in an quick and human-friendly way (not tons of\noptions/menus/concepts like in an image processing program).\nAnd because using plain image files on the web often sucks, it (will)\nprovide solutions that makes good use of CSS.<p>Currently it's just a beta. There is only a very simple CSS solution\nimplemented. It may looks ugly in some browsers. Things are not polished.<p>But I would be very glad to hear any comments of yours on this ""draft"". Do you\nfind it interesting? Do you have any critics/ideas about it? Did you notice\nany bugs or problems?<p>Oh, and I am french, so please excuse me for any grammar/spelling mistake in\nthis post, and don't hesitate to correct me, of course :-)",1236523266

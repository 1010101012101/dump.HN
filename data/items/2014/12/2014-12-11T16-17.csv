8735722,comment,8732331,8734009,0,0,orbifold,,,"Category theory is a language for formulating results in mathematics concisely, which often need input from the problem domain to be proven. Since it allows certain properties to be stated concisely it also makes it easy to see commonalities between structures in disparate areas of mathematics. To give you several concrete examples, which will probably be meaningless to you:<p>If you were to ask what categories are like the category of sets and you were very smart you would arrive at the notion of Topos.<p>The Eilenberg-Zilber theorem states, that two functors between chain complexes are adjunctions to each other.<p>The initial result of Galois theory can also be formulated as an adjunction between two lattices.<p>Just recently the so called &quot;tilting lemma&quot; established an equivalence of categories between certain categories of &quot;perfectoid algebras&quot; over different fields.<p>In programming languages whenever you see something resembling a dataflow diagram, there is a monoidal category lurking in the background. The same is true for reaction diffusion networks and all the digital circuit diagrams ever drawn.<p>Typed lambda calculus is the &quot;internal language&quot; of cartesian closed categories.<p>Similarly linear logic (where resource tracking in Rust comes from) can be seen as the internal logic of some kind of bimonoidal category.<p>There are countless other examples along those lines, the point is that in modern mathematics all the things you consider can be made into a category in one way or another, establishing functors between them gives you a way of studying one thing in terms of the other. Most of the time category theory itself helps very little in doing so. It is just a language for formulating results. Actual research in category theory is done by comparatively few people and is nowadays probably mostly in the area of &quot;higher category theory&quot;.",1418316603

Software piracy is a solved problem. In games, the majority of people now use Steam and nobody really cares about the few that look for it on random torrent websites or some such because:
 1. They are a much more likely source of malware (you don&#x27;t just play files, you run executables).
 2. Games that care have adopted an online-only DRM model (which has its own problems but that&#x27;s a story for another thread)
 3. A lot of games have an audience comprised entirely of non-paying customers (children without credit cards). Parents are not expected to pirate, and if kids do then no harm done.<p>In office software, Photoshop and MS Office are the two big names in piracy and both MS and Adobe silently encourage piracy on their products to enforce lock in. And while that sounds scummy when I put it like that, it is an excellent demonstration of what I was mentioning earlier: You have eyeballs/ears which you can easily turn into wallets.<p>So please, give me a break, your company did not go under because of piracy.

Thermal, drop, vibration, interference, etc. tests are design tests: they verify that units built according to spec are sufficiently reliable. None of the devices you buy have undergone these tests, because the tests are destructive. You wouldn&#x27;t want to buy an iPhone that had been baked in an oven, or dropped on a concrete floor. It&#x27;s best to perform these tests near where development happens, to enable fast iteration and easily involve the hardware engineers.<p>Manufacturing tests verify that individual units have been built according to spec. For example, that there&#x27;s no electrical shorts, missing connections, cosmetic defects, etc. All of the devices you buy have undergone a large battery of manufacturing tests, which exercised all of the hardware features of the device. These tests are performed at the factory, because it&#x27;s better to catch these failures early in the assembly process. For example, if a camera module is busted, you want to know before it&#x27;s installed into an iPhone.<p>Of course Apple isn&#x27;t unique in this way.

If you had a program to figure out whether the output of a program is always correct for any definition of correctness, you could then write a trivial function around it that solves the halting problem:<p><pre><code>    halts(program) {
        testFunction() {
            program()
            return correctImplementation()
        }
        return isCorrect(testFunction)
    }
</code></pre>
In short, make a function that runs the candidate program and ignore its output, then correctly perform whatever task you have a checker for. That function is correct iff the program halts. Since you can&#x27;t determine whether an arbitrary program halts, and you can use any working isCorrect() implementation to determine whether an arbitrary program halts, there&#x27;s no working isCorrect() implementation.",1418314783

8735548,comment,8734877,8734877,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"The complexity of a program has to go somewhere. Everybody&#x27;s got different ideas about where it should go.<p>Old-school Unix guys would prefer that you divide it all up into lots of differently-focused languages, tools, and such based on the ethic of &#x27;doing one thing, well&#x27;. Which is fine and all, but it forces everybody new to learn a hundred little tools and languages to make anything significant.<p>The great thing about using a language/framework is that all your tools can share the same semantics. With OOP, you can model all sorts of interactions between domain concepts and do it in an iterative fashion.<p>But most OOP languages are insufficiently powerful, as the article says. It&#x27;s difficult to move complexity around because OOP languages tend to not be dynamic enough to really be fluid like you need.<p>If you ask me why I think everyone hates OOP, it&#x27;s because they haven&#x27;t really understood Ruby&#x27;s object model.<p>Ruby makes most everything an object that needs to be an object. A primitive is just a syntax for creating a built-in object. All of them ultimately inherit from BasicObject, which is separate from Object because it allows you to create entirely new hierarchies.<p>A block is not an object, but it can be turned into a Proc, which is.<p>All of this fluidity makes it so you can push around the complexity of your application to wherever you feel it needs to be. The ability to see exactly how complex your OOP programs is is a feature, not a bug. How can you remove duplication if you can&#x27;t see it? How can you see the dividing lines of your emerging domain model if there&#x27;s no way to make your code model anything, if it&#x27;s obsessed with data rather than relationships between abstract concepts?<p>With Ruby, you can write the long complex methods, then gradually DRY them up into a bunch of methods, then collect those methods into classes, slowly deciding what needs to be class behavior and what needs to be object behavior, then meta-program the creation of those classes and objects with a DSL/front-end, then finally turn the whole thing into a tool you use declaratively which generates whole new concepts on the fly.<p>It works the way the human mind works, we take concepts and model them and their relationships in our heads and try to reason about edge cases. Once it&#x27;s all well-defined, you can just add new cases as data rather than as code. Your business users think in terms of classes and objects, your boss thinks in those terms.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a domain model you&#x27;re at least trying to work out, then it will be that much more difficult to get them involved in the process. You want them involved because otherwise you have to understand the domain yourself. Your boss will have to come to you whenever the promo generator isn&#x27;t quite working because he won&#x27;t really understand the semantics behind it.<p>If you have an object model you&#x27;re hacking on, you can just hand it to him and be like, &quot;OK point to where you think the problem is&quot;. But if it&#x27;s just a bunch of functions focused on data, that might make it easier for you to trace the data through your pipelines and find the bug, but you&#x27;re going to spend a lot of time translating between the domain model your boss and business users are already and <i>informally</i> using anyway to understand the application and the way you understand that it&#x27;s actually working. They&#x27;re already using a domain model, so it would behoove you to create a canonical model and get it as reflective as possible of the business needs.<p>You don&#x27;t use OOP because it makes it easier for you to understand. It doesn&#x27;t. Clarifying a domain model is hard work. You do it because that complexity has to live somewhere, it should be the domain model, because other people besides programmers are involved in the system too.",1418314698

It clearly rules out a lot of languages.<p>C++ &#x27;OOP&#x27;, by comparison, is little more than syntax sugar for calling functions that take a struct pointer as their first parameter; a feature to make the compiler forcefully limit the access scope of certain members; and a v-table implementation.<p>I really like Go&#x27;s OOP implementation because it doesn&#x27;t pretend to be anything more than the 3 features listed above.<p>> This isolation is really enforced at the heap level<p>This is a very good point.  True messaging OOP with &quot;extreme late-binding&quot; requires by definition that no object knows the memory layout of any other object.  In practice, we achieve this by putting everything on a heap.<p>That characteristic is against C++&#x27;s goals.  Heap isolation is useful for implementing certain features but it is not acceptable to apply it to the entire program when runtime performance is important.<p>But if you don&#x27;t require the pattern everywhere, it really cuts down on the reusability argument for OOP, because inevitably you will want to change a part of your program that doesn&#x27;t use the heap isolation.<p>It&#x27;s also hard to reconcile Kay&#x27;s definition of OOP with C++&#x27;s strict ownership semantics.  It seems like Kay&#x27;s OOP requires a garbage collector almost by definition.<p>C++&#x27;s template system is almost like the dual of Kay&#x27;s OOP.
Instead of messaging, every function call is a candidate for inlining.  State might be hidden by the `private` keyword, but all memory is accessed directly.  All things are bound at compile time.",1418314539

As pointed out by another poster, accurate pole alignment will be the dominant source of error for any reasonably accurate barn door. The short focal lengths, wide field of view, and relatively short &quot;long&quot; exposures of DSLRs (5 minute exposures will induce thermal distortion on my D60 vs >15 minute exposures for film) common in DSLRs don&#x27;t require extreme accuracy, especially if stacking the final images.<p>Barn door trackers can have very low error without curving the rod. Modern microcontrollers also allow digital compensation compared to older barn doors that often used analog synchronous motors, and variations on this design (e.g., the double barn door [1]) can provide tracking accuracy at the limit of hobby applications.<p>[1] <a href=""http://davetrott.com/inventions/double-arm-barn-door-drive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davetrott.com/inventions/double-arm-barn-door-drive/</a>",1418314198

8735453,comment,8734877,8734877,0,0,chton,,,"hoo boy, this article sounds like it was written by somebody who only had a first-year course in OOP.  I hope it&#x27;s mostly tongue-in-cheek, but in case it&#x27;s not, let&#x27;s quickly go through it:<p>1. Paradigm: The paradigm of Object Oriented Programming follows directly from its definition of an object: a structure that contains both data and behaviour. Objects are your first class citizens. &quot;Everything is an object&quot; is, for most, a goal. Everything else, all the variations on how to formulate it or how the language implements it, are interpretations of how to do that.<p>2. Object-Oriented Programming Languages: I agree, everybody has their axe to grind with another language. This is no different from other programmers. On the flip side, for most this axe-grinding is pretty light-hearted.  In a world as big as the OOP one, rivalries are everywhere.<p>3. Classes: &quot;There is a complete disconnect in OOP between the source code and the runtime entities&quot;. Because the runtime entities contain data. Classes determine the behaviour on that data.  It&#x27;s a direct consequence of nr. 1. OO Code shows us the behaviour of an object, interacting with the behaviour of other objects.  
 Everybody is free to dislike it, but calling it &#x27;nonsensical&#x27; is ridiculous.
As an aside: there are IDEs that show objects.  BlueJ (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueJ</a>) comes to mind.  They tend to be educational tools, because seeing and inspecting actual objects during development means you still need to work on how you mentally model the code.<p>4. Methods: Methods should be a sensible length. Make them as short and as sweet as is possible, but no shorter.  If you need to go bouncing around huge amounts of tiny methods to figure out what is going on, you have a code smell. If you have to search through a 1000-line monster of a method to figure out what is going on, you have a code smell too.  The goal is to find a sweet spot, not to apply some rules to their extreme.<p>5. Types: I&#x27;ll be short on this one: the point of types is to make sure you don&#x27;t accidentally do something stupid. In the process, they make other things harder, but also more predictable.  If you don&#x27;t like that, no problem, there are OO languages that are dynamically typed, or ducktyped, or any other variation on the theme.<p>6. Change: I don&#x27;t quite know what the author means with change here.  He seems to mix up change of the program (maintenance, extension, etc.), with change in the program&#x27;s environment.<p>7. Design Patterns: A standard way to solve a standard problem. Refusing to use them or not knowing them will lead to either bugs or reinventing them.  If they &#x27;make your design more complicated&#x27;, you&#x27;re using them wrong.<p>8. Methodologies: Are a general problem in all programming, and always have been.<p>9. UML: I&#x27;m a professional developer. I almost exclusively do OOP.  I haven&#x27;t touched UML in years.  I haven&#x27;t seen UML in years, not from other developers, not from architects, not generated by the code.  The code is the code, the modelling language is a way to communicate about the structure of the code.  Reversing that relationship just means you&#x27;re hiding code behind a graphical representation. See also: BlueJ.<p>10. The Next New Thing: Happens everywhere.<p>The conclusion sounds like a complete inversion of the original premise of the article. I agree we have a long way to go in OOP, and I agree we are still in the early days of OOP. But hating OOP is as shortsighted as hating FP, or procedural programming, or any other paradigm.",1418313711

10564214,comment,10563540,10564003,0,0,zaroth,,,"I think our significantly decreasing reliance on foreign energy has put the writing on the wall. Middle East countries used to pushing hundreds of billions in oil welfare and running surpluses will be in serious deficit and facing a decimated budget which will tank their economies. Perhaps the thinking is to revolt now before the money is all gone? With such a strikingly oil-centric economy, oil crashed from its high, steady technological progress making their fields increasingly irrelevant over time... Cities built on $140 oil will sink back into the sand. Seems to me massacring innocent French civilians only makes it happen faster.<p>We meddle a lot less overall in the Middle East the last 8 years than the prior 8, right? If we don&#x27;t then Russia steps up to do it themselves (for better or worse US has no leadership there anymore so maybe why not Russia give it a shot?)<p>In the end I personally don&#x27;t believe the massacre is in any way &quot;caused&quot; by US or other foreign involvement in the Middle East. This is not the first caliphate, nor will it be the last, and it&#x27;s not about righting wrongs or a struggle for independence, it&#x27;s literally about inflicting mass casualties on the infidels in as an atrocious and terrifying (i.e beheadings) manor as possible.<p>Over 100 murdered is a mind boggling atrocity but also a terrible security failure. Not just in failing to catch and prevent it, but failure to take out the shooters at the concert sooner. (I haven&#x27;t read a detailed account of how the shooters were stopped if there is one)",1447469988

For whatever reason analyzing finances is enjoyable in a Civ-ish way though I never would have made the connection.<p>A couple of things I&#x27;ve noticed as I&#x27;ve done something similar:<p>1) Categorizing the little things as you go along was way too tedious for me too - even in really stripped down form. I really like the idea of categorizing All The Things though. How I dealt with this was to download 90 representative days worth of credit card history into LibreOffice and remove all of the &quot;still gets paid even if I&#x27;m cryogenically frozen&quot; payments. I then manually categorize everything that is left (quick because the categorization is batched up and auto-complete works wonders), divide by 90 and generate a pivot table that shows the daily sum of each of the categories. Where I think we diverge though is that rather than trying to keep this snapshot up to date, I just make a mental note of it as &quot;Okay, I average $XX/day on everything else&quot;.<p>As long as you know your starting CC balance then it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out how you are doing for the pay period. Just a matter of $start + $daily_cc * $days.<p>2) Kinda similar to the web app (in spirit if not functionality), I set up a little Python CLI tool that simulates my recurring expenses (along with my recurring $XX &quot;all other crap&quot; fund from above). Once you&#x27;ve set up the recurrence relations you can step through two weeks at a time, pausing to change state, transfer money, etc. It&#x27;s basically like using a debugger which is an enjoyable way to test out various ideas you have that&#x27;s a little bit more freeform than a spreadsheet where its hard to see how various ad hoc tweaks layer on top of one another over time.",1447469386

Communist orthodoxy believed in a historical inevitability that overlapped very closely with a sort of man-made Divine Providence. The Nazis had their own set of religious and spiritual motivations, their racial destiny and so on.<p>> They differed from Abrahamic religions in the sense that they expected &quot;victory&quot; in this world and in their time, as opposed to vague posthumous compensations and end-of-times prophecies; but they did believe in a &quot;greater power&quot; manifesting itself in their successful deeds.<p>Good point; I forgot about the historical-determinist side of Communism. I&#x27;m more familiar with the Nazis, who believed in an empty, Providence-less cosmos that was more or less Lovecraftian (and who accordingly made themselves a pretty convincing Cthulhu) -- see _Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning_ for the details.<p>> That&#x27;s a false dichotomy. The problems in Syria won&#x27;t go away with bombs, and it was manifestly stupid for Hollande to join the party willy-nilly, especially after having experienced first-hand the inefficiency of his security apparatus. What is needed is a real agreement between the real power brokers (Turkey, Saudi, Russia, Iran) to cut off the crazies for good. We need hard diplomacy, not hard policies.<p>Surely both at once wouldn&#x27;t hurt. We need concerted ground action to defeat ISIS -- and in particular, we need Turkey to decide once and for all which side they&#x27;re on -- but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad idea to present a united front; I _do_ think that it&#x27;s a bad idea to imagine that making concessions will inspire fewer lone wolves and opportunists, rather than more.",1447469259

Sure, it follows the agenda of the largest contributors (US, Germany, France) but I think it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch to say that its ultimate goal is to transfer meager resources from Burkina Faso and Yemen to more developed nations. In fact, it&#x27;s a good thing that they are as strict as they are with loan terms.

4462197,comment,4460299,4462161,1,0,seertaak,,,"Thanks, the ability to export to Ableton would be very cool. It's actually not that hard; Ableton can import midi, so as long as you set up the actual sounds yourself it's as simple as storing a .mdi file on Dropbox or Google Drive. That's something we could feature. And exporting entire loops should be easy as well.<p>As far as complicated rhythms go, I'd love to get some audio samples of you beatboxing! One of the things we have planned is a petition for beatbox samples -- we'll write a web app or rich client that makes it as easy and quick as possible. That'll allow us to get some better data than the little corpus I've been building up!<p>If you want to help out, you can either sign up for updates at <a href=""http://beatmaticapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beatmaticapp.com</a> or email us at dev at beatmaticapp com.

4462196,comment,4460853,4461880,2,0,DenisM,,,"> my memory is limited<p>This is tangental, but I find this an interesting topic -  your memory not limited, at least not the way most people think it is. To be accurate - a body of experiments has failed to turn any evidence for old knowledge preventing formation of new knowledge, or new knowledge pushing out the old.<p>What prevents formation of new knowledge is time - you could learn A or B, but not both at the same time. What makes us forget piece A is not the piece B committed after A, but absence of repetition of A. If you repeat A every so often, you will remember it equally well regardless of whether you also repeat B or not during the same period.<p>I get my information from this book, which in turn has references to all of the underling studies: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Shallows-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393072223"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Shallows-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/...</a>",1346457577

I would guess a good amount of that work was writing millions of lines of code, electrical and circuit design, designing for manufacture, and all that stuff you actually can't copy.

It was also built on top of a JVM.

4462182,comment,4459412,4461126,3,0,daave,,,"Mayson, can you be more specific? What has happened to them?<p>Gmail: I can't think of anything negative that's happened to Gmail in recent times (unless you didn't like the UI redesign - there are certainly mixed opinions on that), and certainly the performance and uptake of Gmail has only improved.<p>Google Reader: Not much new happening, but it's still running. Are you referring to the changes in the sharing model? Whichever sharing model was better, surely you can agree that having one unified sharing experience across Google produces results in a more streamlined product, and at least this was a step in the right direction.<p>Google Labs: Was closed down, yes. I still don't understand how this relates to the parent post. My thoughts on closing down labs: Labs was supposed to be a way to get ideas out there in the wild before turning them into a fully-supported core product. This was great for the engineers who had built these things (they got to see them used), and the early-adopters who tried Labs products. However, as time goes on and nobody's doing any development work on a particular thing in Labs anymore, there is still an operational cost to other engineers at the company who have to keep the thing up and running. Since it's a 'Google' product, the brand image is at stake, so we can't just let them wither. So I think it's reasonable to decide to have each labs product either shut down or integrated into a core (supported) product. Perhaps it would have been better to chuck all the old labs and start again, with a published policy that things in labs will either be fully supported or completely gone 1 year after launch (or something). The removal of labs is a signal that there's more red tape around launching new products than there used to be, but I think that's inevitable as a company grows, and more than some engineer's weekend is on the line if a lunch goes badly.<p>20% Time: Still as strong as ever, from what I can tell. About half the engineers I know have a 20% project, and there's nobody who doesn't have one who wishes they could have one. Most of the time if people don't have a 20% project it's only because they find their core job interesting and diverting enough that they don't have a desire to split their time with a side-project. Despite what some people have claimed on HN, your manager can't deny you from having a 20% project if you want one.<p>(I work for Google, but not on any of the products mentioned above, and I (willfully) don't have a 20% project. These are my opinions and not necessarily those of my employer.)",1346456976

And that it fails in a statistically significant number of cases.  And that due to the behavior confirmation effect (self-fulfilling prophecy) it ends up true in more cases than it could.<p>Meaning IQ is an OK measure in many cases, but very flawed.

Use cases are relatively easy--somebody has a problem, come up with a solution--but any solution can be expressed in a myriad of different ways. The way that the API designer expresses that solution to the users of the API will impact the way code is written.<p>Users generally won't understand the implementation of the API, so instead they build a model of how they think the entire system operates. In the process, they make assumptions about performance, side effects, etc. that may be totally incorrect. Good APIs anticipate these assumptions and make them relatively easy to predict with some level of experience, either from elsewhere in the API or from similar APIs.",1346454135

Race is also genetic, but really is shorthand for variation in <i>hundreds</i>, maybe thousands of genes.<p>It's well-established that intelligence is polygenic.  That doesn't mean it's not genetic - if everybody had the same genes, ~80% of the variation in intelligence would be eliminated.  It also doesn't mean that there's a single genetic switch we can throw to design a master race of human geniuses.  It means exactly what it says: that there are some combination of genes that interact together to produce ~70-90% of the variance in the measured quantity that we label ""intelligence"".",1346454133

Which is also what you use a relational database for so I don't see how you can do one and not the other.</i><p>Which is exactly my point, again. It's not that I can't do both. It's that, although both questions take similar intelligence, one of them is phrased in an unfamiliar way. I start off disadvantaged in the former question because my lack of familiarity with what the ""correct"" answer should look like. With the latter, I know how to begin thinking and answering. Yet, an IQ only provides one of these options so if I got the one I was not familiar with, I would score low. My point is that is not a sign of a lack of intelligence.<p><i>Just like saying ""no camels means no camels"" indicates an understanding of the dumb-but-simple question. Saying ""some camels"" is the answer I won't accept.</i><p>But to understand a question, the premise of it has to make sense to you. For my example, I can understand the question because I'm aware that there is a <i>real</i> solution. In the example from the article, to ask farmers who only know about cities with camels about the camels in a city where there are no camels doesn't make sense to them. It's an unnecessary abstraction and just shows that they haven't experienced a situation rather than that they can't answer a simple question.<p>To me it's almost as if someone asked me ""in a math system where 1 * a is not a, what is 1 * a?"" or ""what is 2 + 2 for arbitrarily large values of 2?""

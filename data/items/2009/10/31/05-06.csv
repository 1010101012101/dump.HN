913321,comment,912889,913066,0,0,sketerpot,,,"To elaborate a little: you don't sense the oxygen level in your blood. You sense the CO2 level, using acidity sensors in your aorta. CO2 dissolved in your blood reaches an equilibrium with carbonic acid, which means that the acidity of your blood is proportional to the amount of CO2. It's stuff like this that makes physiology fun to study.",1256968480

I have followed his blog since he released his product and I am convinced he is a great role model for bootstrapped entrepreneurs.\nThe thing I am most grateful for is that Peldi actually took the time to document the whole process all the way back when he still was working at Adobe and secretly planning to start his own business.\nJust go back to his blog and check all the postings from 2008.. a great story. Good work and thanks for sharing how do you do run a great company!",1256968188

913317,comment,913169,913312,0,0,ramchip,,,"You'd be surprised. I'd say the vast majority of URLs I see around in Japan end in .jp. Hitting ctrl+enter after an URL will add www and .co.jp on most computers, not .com. Few people understand english sufficiently to browse the english-speaking internet; the best example is probably Facebook, which is rarely used here, while its local equivalent mixi.jp is extremely popular.<p>Also, the QWERTY keyboard is just <i>not</i> the standard worldwide...<p>That being said, I don't think people will start using japanese URLs much. The alphabet + .jp is already ingrained and more convenient. Also, most phones will refuse japanese characters in an email adress and perhaps in an URL, which is a game breaker here.",1256967883

Seems like hands free can simulate talking to a passenger, which is shown to not be as distracting.

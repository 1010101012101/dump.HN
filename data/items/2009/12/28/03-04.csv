You can set up filters and whatnot, but it's still a very narrow model.<p>A more social system leveraging your interests, your peers, and all that other crap could surface good content you might otherwise have never seen, plus the best content you were already seeing.

That's more believable than the reason this story puts forth.<p>I can't imagine AT&T's failure to sell them online to New Yorkers will help much if their towers are overly congested. I would imagine most people either buy iPhones from Apple or an AT&T store.<p>Anyone who didn't find one online but knew they wanted one would get one from another channel. And if there are people who are actually unsure of what phone they want and browse around online to figure it out and who would have chosen an iPhone were it there, those people will probably end up on some other data-consuming phone as well which doesn't really solve AT&T's problem.<p>I really just can't picture this conversation:<p>Exec 1: Hey, our service sucks in NYC because too many people are using data. What can we do?<p>Exec 2: We could stop selling the iPhone to New Yorkers on our website. That should solve the whole problem.<p>Exec 1: Brilliant!<p>(Execs toast their Guinnesses)",1261971697

At some point you need to understand the subject for itself, and not in terms of something else.<p>That said I strongly second his point about the value of keeping designs simple.

However based on experience I am inclined towards believing that something like this is true.  If you further believe (as I do), that the source of the requirements doesn't matter, then adding internal requirements about design is going to result in complications.<p>As a result I am inclined towards simple, clean designs.  I gladly introduce polymorphism, abstraction layers, and so on fairly frequently.  But <i>only</i> if I see a concrete benefit from doing so.  If I am not convinced that this piece of abstraction produces a net win within the context of this software solution, I don't do it.<p>(For the record I am not a software master by any means.  In Zed Shaw's terms I'd be an expert, although early mentoring with the right person kept me from ever suffering from the love of complexity that he pastes all experts with.)",1261970643

Every single person had their luggage opened and sorted through, item by item.<p>2. Every single person was being fully patted down.  Including checking the soles of your (shoeless) feet.<p>The pat down was remarkably thorough - the seams of my pants were checked.

1018020,comment,1017550,1017550,0,0,marciovm123,,,"I see this as a case of the fundamental problem with the international non-profit model: the money comes in at one place, the supposed value-creation is happening somewhere far away, and the non-profit group in between is the only entity in contact with both sides. In other words, the value that the 1st-world government or individual is getting for their donation is based largely on what they hear from the non-profit. Since the non-profit is incentivized to report success to keep the money flowing, it's unlikely to report an accurate picture of what is happening. With time, non-profits become very good at raising money with inspirational stories of intense human needs, project potential, supposed past achievements, and hip language (not to mention political connections). At the same time, since their actual effectiveness at achieving their goals is largely irrelevant to their business model, it almost certainly sucks. As OP indicates, transparency is the solution, and the internet should certainly enable that to a greater degree then currently happens.",1261970004

While it is true that pure CAPM and ECMH has basically been written off, many economists still believe it is more than ""loose fill"".  The basic formula remains the same but needs to be improved with a more robust set of risk factors, a more siginificant nod to behavioral analysis, and a more coherent way to do both.  Nonetheless, I certainly don't agree with the contention that EMH is dead.  Instead, I would contend that is an unfinished block of clay waiting for details to turn it into a workable model.<p>For a more modern take, see Andrew Lo's Adaptive Market Hypothesis.",1261969845

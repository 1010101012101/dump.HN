3327359,comment,3327232,3327232,3,0,joe_the_user,,,"I don't think the article's argument justifies the idea that fewer cars will be sold.<p>Cars wear out primarily through driving. If you simply switched to automatic driving, what you would have is fewer cars being driven more often and so being worn more quickly. If car-mile consumption stays the same, new-car production would stay the same. 
On the other hand, if the auto-drive cars increased carpooling, then you'd see a decrease in car-miles consumed and so a decrease in production. But if auto-drive cars drove around empty more, you might have even more car-miles being consumed.<p>Moreover, you'd have a ""big bang"" where people decide to mostly stop driving the old, non-automatically-driving cars and so there'd a huge spike in consumption at that point.<p>The space saved by avoiding parking could be really large, still.<p>A nice thing would be that at the start, a person might be able to finance their self-driving car by renting in out when they didn't need it. Those economies might make the phenomena spread really quickly.",1323313192
3327358,comment,3327232,3327297,2,0,kkowalczyk,,,"That's true but consider that most of those people go to/from the same place.<p>If entity that provides those cars is big enough, they can match up the destination and optimize the traffic so that people going to the (roughly) same place share a car. When I was commuting from SF to MV for work, I had to use the whole car. There were plenty of other people who were commuting at the same time from/to very similar destination and used the whole car. It's not hard to algorithmically put several such people into the same car.<p>Today cars are 4/5 seaters so you get at 3x reduction compared to current levels (taking into account that not everyone drives by himself today) but you could easily redesign the cars to not be much larger and taking 8-10 people. Or make them straight up buses. Google already does that with their shuttles where they pick e.g. people from SF and drive them in big buses to MV, except it would be much more efficient because the potential pool of people transfered would not be just ""people who work at Google and live in SF"" but ""every person who lives in SF and works somewhere in MV"", which is a much bigger number.",1323313191

The Raleigh/Durham MSAs combine for about 1.6M in total population spread over a pretty sprawling area and we have had LTE service for a few months.<p>I frankly don't get the complaints or the folks who are going to downgrade to 3G. If you don't have LTE available, the device will fall back to 3G. When you do have LTE available, however, the performance can be unbelievable.

3327352,comment,3326142,3327320,7,0,patio11,,,"Kinda tangential, but since I want to help people do better at SEO: That page is not SEO optimized -- it isn't even designed to be accessible to crawlers.  It is only linked to from post-purchase emails and me when answering customer support requests.  No page on my site other than the front page would ever rank for [bingo cards], certainly not on the strength of on-page optimizations.<p>If a consulting client told me they were worried about poor rankings because of low keyword recurrence on their landing pages I'd tell them that on-page factors wouldn't make a difference for head-of-the-distribution terms either way and you don't need <i>re</i>-occurrence to rank for tail terms, so that is probably not a terribly big worry.  Having insufficient text on a page to rank for anything is a bit of a worry.  If you're trying to satisfy the competing imperatives ""Conversion rate/user happiness goes up when we take text off"" and ""Rankings go up when we add text"" the solution I'd recommend pretty quickly is ""Put the text below the fold, where only Googlebot and the sliver of humans who actually enjoy reading will see it.""",1323313113

While car rental companies may decline to change their rates on a minute-by-minute basis the only reason is to prevent customer confusion, nothing technical will stop it. Supply, demand, and price information can optimize a system like nothing else.<p>And even during peak times, car rentals will be augmented by a suddenly-reinvigorate public transport system; your car may take you to a bus, to be picked up by a car on the other end.<p>The only missing bit of tech is the actual self-driving car. Everything else is simple and obvious extrapolation from brain-dead simple Economics 101 and already-existing network technology. Modern car usage will be seen as only an incremental improvement on horse-drawn buggies, with the real revolution happening much later.",1323313065
3327349,comment,3326425,3327080,2,0,scarmig,,,"It's not striking down a law, but you can see the process at work most clearly in Bush v. Gore. It was, on the face of it, a horrible decision, and the court itself said it shouldn't be used for any precedent; it's not been cited once since then.<p>But it isn't merely a matter of disagreeing with the decision. It's the crass politicization of it. If you look at the breakdown of the vote, the Justices who supported Bush supported Bush, and those who supported Gore supported Gore. (Thomas's wife was heavily involved in Bush's campaign, and O'Conner had said the evening before the election that she'd find Gore's election personally disastrous.)<p>Nor can ideology account for the decision: the same justices who are pretty stingy when it comes to applying Fourteenth Amendment rights generally suddenly found it imperative to extend it to a radically new situation in an usurpation of state rights with federal judicial might. The converse was also true, as the Justices usually distrustful of states running their own elections suddenly thought that sacrosanct.<p>Edited to add a particularly damning quote:<p>""The counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner Bush, and to the country, by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election. Count first, and rule upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires."" IOW, Scalia is banning the recounting of the votes of undecided legality because it might make Bush's election look less legitimate and cause political turmoil.",1323313052

While techniques like FXAA are needed for deferred rendering due to the order of operations, I don't see why FXAA isn't acceptable on non-deferred renderers.<p>> Detecting edges on the depth buffer may sound as the solution until you realize that two planes at right angles has an edge between that can alias. The change there is in the normal and not the Z.<p>If you have two planes at a right angle to each other, you'd see that in the depth buffer.  Imagine you're looking at a line of pixels and you're doing this on each pixel -- you'd look to see if the pixels on either side of the one you're on are trending in opposite directions from the current one, and know it's an edge.<p>> Also modern graphics cards do not give programmatic access to the z-buffer as the z-buffer format is often proprietary.<p>As far as I'm aware, all modern graphics cards allow you to render the depth buffer to texture just like the color buffer.<p>> Deferred rendering can render large number of dynamic, unshadowed lights very efficiently.

I've received a couple of them and they're so bizarre to me.  First of all, they apparently cost $3.95, which is a 15.8% fee on a $25 card.  (You would think Visa and Mastercard would be so happy to have more cards out there causing 3% transaction fees to happen that they'd give the cards away at face value).<p>Then they're actually less practical than cash.  You have to spend <i>exactly</i> the card balance to use them effectively.  So if I swipe it at Starbucks a few times until it's down to $1.49, the next transaction will simply be declined!  I'd have to ask the barista ahead of time to split the transaction and charge exactly $1.49 to the card (so I have to mentally track the balance or call Visa/MC every time I use it).  I'm guessing it's more likely that people reach the point where the card is declined and then throw it away, with Visa/MC pocketing the remains.<p>If you want to use it online, you have to go to the Visa/MC web site and register it (provide your personal details) so that the card is associated with billing details.  Lovely side effect: they get your personal contact information to spam you with.<p>For the love of all that is rational, please don't give me these cards, I'd much rather have $28.95 cash than $25 + extra hassles.  The best use of these cards I could come up with is converting them to a gift card at a particular store you actually like.  Store gift cards have correct overflow semantics - the full balance of the card will be used and the register will ask you to come up with the difference.",1323311537

You seem like a nice, earnest guy who in many ways is really trying to help.<p>But your inability to distinguish between bullshit and demonstration of value is abhorrent to me. If you make an amazing product and never tell anyone about it, you're keeping it a secret. If you honestly demonstrate its value to a demographic who can truly benefit from it, that's good marketing and communication. If you lie or exaggerate to people about what your product can do, that's bullshit. These are on a spectrum.<p>I'm going to be blunt here. Pretty much everything on your site, from the branding, to the copy, to the actual blog post itself, which I find mostly insubstantial, sets off alarms. Your basic premise -- that transactions should be mutually beneficial and sales is communication of that mutual benefit -- is not particularly insightful or well-represented. The ratio of self-promotion to content is disconcerting. The presented 'attitude' is off-putting and seems forced.<p>The fact that you can't distinguish between what patio11 does and what an archetypal used car salesman just makes me think you're a bullshitter.<p>But maybe I'm not your target demographic. That's fine. Don't let me stop you. If it works, it works. But know that that's the kind of stuff that makes me allergic to self-promotion in the first place. I don't want to present myself this way, I don't want to <i>be</i> this way, even if that's what it takes to succeed. And the fact that it works hurts my soul.<p>Again, I'm not attacking you, and I'm not trying to be negative. I'm trying to be honest about how I perceive your site.

You can still connect to it with any standards-compliant MUA to download messages, and you can send messages to it like you would send messages with any mail server.  Every user can talk to the rest of the Internet, and every user on the Internet can talk to Gmail users.  So there is no extension or extinguishing going on; it's just another mail host that is functionally identical, from a standards perspective, to any other.  You happen to also get a nice web interface for free.<p>Compare this to Exchange, which is its own system with a special client and special server.  Good luck using offlineimap to sync your Exchange inbox.<p><i>But sure, let's talk about how Eric Schmidt was the Apple board during the development of the iPhone.</i><p>When Eric Schmidt was on Apple's board, he did not attend any meetings related to the iPhone, and then eventually resigned.  He also got Android through buying an outside company, which did not sit on Apple's board.<p><i>So let's talk about the design similarities between Android and iPhone.</i><p>You press a picture of the phone when you want to make a phone call, and then your voice is transmitted over the cellular phone network to the person you're talking to?  Icons are pictures of things?  You can send and receive text messages and email from the phones?<p>Ultimately, any phone is going to be very similar to any other phone, because they are both phones.<p><i>And I don't think a company that develop's open source should be able to place ads on it, as to me, that is still 'selling' the software.</i><p>Interesting thought.  When you write your own open source software, don't put any ads on it.<p>But it's worth pointing out that Google doesn't put ads in Android.  Some providers even switch the search engine that Android uses from Google to Bing.  The point of open source is freedom; if someone wants to make money with it, you can just delete that part.  And people have done that with Android.",1323309857

Microsoft took three years (and still doesn't have traction).
Nokia took took four years (and then threw it away).

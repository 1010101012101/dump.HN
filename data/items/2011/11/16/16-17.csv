I was making a minor point about productivity, but this isn't the biggest issue at all in software development.<p>The biggest productivity difference between two programmers isn't that one of them produces more of the same thing as the other.  Or that one of them produces more of a better thing that the other.  Or even that one of them produces a more of a better, different thing than the other.  It's that one of them actually grasps the thing that should to be done and does it.  And it can take a long time to even realize or understand what it is the programmer is doing (often, the programmer doesn't fully understand it at first either).<p>My biggest problem with the 10x productivity claims is that it ignores the most relevant difference.  The best programmers don't do the same things faster, they do completely different things.",1321461065

It's a <i>bias/variance tradeoff</i>.<p>If you've done statistics, you know that B/V tradeoffs are more or less an unavoidable feature of optimization or learning. If you go in with less clear goals, you depend on learning on the fly to find the best solution which means your performance varies a lot depending on environmental conditions. If you go in with very clear goals, it's likely that people will cluster around them tightly, but if you're  <i>wrong</i> with your bias, you'll be surely fucked.<p>How do you beat B/V tradeoffs? You put in more effort, more experience, better sharing of information. You select your biases very carefully such that they are less clear but cannot possibly be wrong. You constrain your variance such that it is less harmful to your task.<p>Finally, there's the idea of consistency and convergence rates. Consistency means that if any person spends <i>enough</i> time and effort they will eventually overcome both bias and variance and find the best solution. Rate of convergence is how much time and effort it takes to get reasonably close.

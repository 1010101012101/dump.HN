The difference for me is that I think reading good literature or maybe even watching a good film can help make you a better person, depending on how you define ""better"".  Sometimes literature can bring up ethical or philosophical issues: consider how ""Antigone"" makes you think about the relationship between citizen and state, ""Cat's Cradle"" discusses the dangers of technology, or ""Less Than Zero"" sheds light on the alienation and social dysfunction of the wealthy suburban middle class.  It's easy to think about the tragedy of child soldiers in Africa, but it wasn't until I read ""Beasts Of No Nation"" by Uzodinma Iweala that I realized just how horrific things really are.  Reading classics like ""The Odyssey"" or Dante's ""Inferno"" will help you understand Western culture in general.  Certain novels are important from a historical point of view, e.g. ""The Jungle"" or ""Uncle Tom's Cabin.""  This is one of the reasons I prefer reading to most other forms of entertainment: a movie or a video game can be fun to watch or play, but beyond that, there's usually not much else there.<p>I'm not suggesting that people only read fiction for self-improvement or to make you better at conversation: there's nothing wrong with reading something for it's own sake.  Is reading something for its own sake better than watching a movie or playing a video game for its own sake?  Probably not.",1206817198

149560,comment,149413,149526,0,0,PieSquared,,,"You're right. It's not.<p>The word ""hacking"" has, in the media, taken on a meaning which is different from the meaning that it had originally - and the meaning that you'll most often find around here.  Sadly, though, the use is so common that arguing against it is pretty much hopeless. It seems that outside of the hacker community (proper sense of the word), you probably shouldn't call yourself a hacker, since the first thing that will come to people's minds is this.<p>This isn't hacking. This is 'cracking' - and a more disgusting form of it than usual,  a form meant to physically harm people.",1206816276

This will give you a pretty good idea of how hardware works, but the projects will be limited to you, a breadboard and some switches - not terribly exciting stuff.<p>On the other hand, if you want to learn build simple robots and such, you'll have something neat to do, but at the end you likely still won't have an idea of how a CPU works or GPS chip works.",1206816107

149556,comment,149467,149549,0,0,boucher,,,"I disagree.  If you use name recognition as a proxy for knowledge (which is probably a poor metric), than you're probably as likely to have heard of Turing as your are Pushkin.  The set of people who have heard both is likely to be much smaller, and by inference, more knowledgeable.<p>On the other side of the argument, you could argue its easier to understand the contributions of someone like Pushkin than someone like Fermi.  But this too is probably true only on a superficial of level.",1206815976

When trained, the course took the mouse about 20 seconds to run and it looks like it must be one really smart mouse. But really, it learnt the route one step at a time over a period of days. I suspect a similar technique is used here.",1206815919

Even just thinking about girls is likely to cause you more emotional anguish than anything else in your life. And it's not like getting mauled by a bear -- that kind of pain goes away after a month or so. No, love, when it goes bad, is worse than pretty much anything. So, why mess with it? Why not just avoid girls altogether? Well, I must admit I've asked myself this many times. And the answer is: can't help it. The emotions and drive are too strong to deny. So, just do the best you can. It is, actually, pretty damn good to have a girlfriend when things are going well. And try to make the best decisions you can, even though your brain isn't really running the show.",1206815574

But it's perfectly normal or accepted to ignore who Enrico Fermi, Alan Turing or Paul Erd≈ës were. We're all ignorant about something but, in society, literary ignorance is frowned upon much more than scientific ignorance.",1206815377

That really did change the way I thought of her.<p>But more generally, I can't make my mind up one way or another about this. I've seen the kind of relationship the last part of the article talks about - very long term, very stable with interests like books, movies, music etc being completely irrelevant - so that makes me think its quite right. At the same time, there's gotta be some baseline - how can a music lover go out with someone that thinks highly of (say) Paris Hilton's music? Or a normal person with a objectivist? ;)",1206815340

Among the startups we see at the Bootstrapper Breakfasts very few are able to prospect for oil and find uranium in their backyard.

149542,comment,149482,149495,0,0,morbidkk,,,"I definitely agree with your first exercise. It would give some kind of confidence and any newbie would feel at home to web apps. Reading SICP/git; add to that Data structure CS stuff is not at all mandatory to become hacker. Thats the ""school"" way or maybe it worked for some people. My gut feeling is you need to work on some part of your app every day. It would lead to html/css/JS and then get/post basics and common boilerplate routines for them in java/python/ruby etc.Unless until someone starts real programming; reading books wont do any good. Stumble across problem; Google; download sample solution..make it work on pc; figure out how it worked; tinker; customize and keep logs in your work journal. It would motivate you on some down day.\nAt least I feel happy when I solve problem this way. There are ""Big problems to solve"" but maybe I have to learn about ""small and smart problems which people have already solved"" first. And as newton said ""I could see farther because I am sitting on  shoulder of giants""...something like that.<p>Once it becomes part of thinking process then you would automatically go to books to figure out what you need at this point of time. So becoming a hacker is not a goal; goal is to get that attitude deeply imbibed in everything you do with problems.<p>disclaimer: I am just at the bottom of the pyramid actually. But whenever I get to know things about programmers; I find all I wrote above.<p>P.S. get ""Just for Fun- Revolutionary story birth of Linux operating systems"".

10819651,comment,10819025,10819454,0,0,rogerbinns,,,"Fabs are <i>very</i> expensive.  You can see numbers ranging from 4 to 10 billion dollars each.  Those are the fixed costs that you now need to spread over production.  It looks like Nvidia does around 20 million chips a year.  If a $4bn fab was useful for 4 years, then those fixed costs work out at $50 per chip!<p>If you make other people&#x27;s chips on the same fab then the per chip costs go down, assuming there is spare capacity.  The economies of scale really do help.  Which is why there are a few foundries who do most of the chips, and those foundries can spread the costs over a large number of chips including later ones that don&#x27;t need the newest process.  For example Intel is known to do their CPUs on the current process, while doing the chipsets on the older processes.<p>In other words, work out what set of numbers would make sense, and you won&#x27;t be able to find any.  New processes keep getting more expensive, and competitors adopt them too, so you have to sustain your current fab as well as the work to do the next generation one.  This requires a lot of available money.<p>Don&#x27;t build a fab unless you are sure you can use almost all its capacity for the next several years.",1451595539

Back in the early/mid 00s, Wikipedia was the site you&#x27;d contribute to if you wanted to write general encyclopedia entries about something that&#x27;s now seen as fairly niche (like say, a certain TV show, film series, game franchise, etc), and from there you might become interested in editing other pages on less specialised subjects.<p>But now, thousands of wikis exist, about every subject under the sun. Many of those are very popular, have more welcoming communities, etc.  So people don&#x27;t join the general site any more.  If they care for say, Star Wars, they join Wookiepedia.  If they care for Pokemon, it&#x27;d be Bulbapedia.

Employer-sponsored healthcare is excluded from both payroll and income taxation which makes it very attractive for employers to offer. The author doesn&#x27;t understand how marginal tax rates work.

When I first started in the early 90&#x27;s, there was no clear defined trail on &#x27;how to do it&#x27;. I learned over time what works and the right way to do it. I&#x27;d like to make a few comments.<p>You asked about organizations that engage in &#x27;citizen science&#x27;, I would start with the NOAA Co-ops program <a href=""https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/cooperative-observer-network-coop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-dat...</a> . This would give you the basics. Another route taken is through a college based program. <a href=""http://iowafloodcenter.org/projects/stream-stage-sensor/river-stage-sensors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iowafloodcenter.org/projects/stream-stage-sensor/rive...</a> As you can see, Iowa has a program that is on the lines of what you are looking at.<p>You mention about cheap &#x27;disposable&#x27; sensors. Truth be told, no reliable sensor is truly cheap. In sensing, we look at repeatability, accuracy and resolution. In the design of a sensor we also look at interfacing and field calibrations.<p>Field data collection systems are comprised of several parts. Power, Sensing, Data Logging and Telemetry. It&#x27;s interesting, different vendors of this equipment take different approaches. Everything revolves around the abilities of the data logger. Let&#x27;s look at several:<p>Hobo: <a href=""http://www.onsetcomp.com/products"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onsetcomp.com/products</a> This is a pretty good company. The sensors have good accuracy. The products are reasonably priced. However, you are locked into their products and limitations. I&#x27;ve seen Hobo used by students in course work.<p>What does the USGS, USACE, NOAA and BUREC use for data logging? They use capable data loggers that can accept SDI-12 and ModBus based sensors along with Analog based sensing.

In 2017 you owe capital gains on $900.<p>However, AMT(alternative minimum tax) doesnt recognize ISO.  So in 2015, you have to calculate AMT, which $400 counts towards.  This is basically a no-deduction(except a high standard deduction) flat tax, you potentially owe 26-35% on that 400.  Even though you didnt sell anything - this is where people get screwed.<p>So lets say you paid $100 in AMT.  In 2017, you still owe capital gains tax on the whole $900, but you calculate AMT and claim the difference, up to $100, as a credit - the difference should be >100.  You can actually claim this credit every year until previously paid AMT runs out, but most likely the difference wont be sizable enough until you sell.",1451595047

10819609,comment,10818865,10818865,0,0,tokenadult,,,"As mentioned in the other recent thread about Wikikpedia, I am a Wikipedian. I joined active editing in 2010, that is after the heyday of welcoming new editors, but long before most articles on important topics were anywhere near to being well sourced. I have tried to clean up the mess on some articles, and am a winner or co-winner of two Million Awards[1] for fixing up high-page-view articles.<p>But how I got the awards basically illustrates the problem. One article I fixed I wrote entirely off-line in a text editor file, while commenting on the talk page of the previous lousy version of the article, and then I dropped in the new article text all at once. Every previous time when I tried piecemeal editing of that article, my best edits would be reverted, while other stuff that was entirely made up and without reliable sources would be inserted into the article. The second article I worked on fixing up was a collaborative effort. Again, I started with discussion on the article talk page. My first few edits were reverted, contrary to reliable sources, by editors who exerted &quot;ownership&quot; on the article but who refused to look up sources. Later I was joined by two other editors, and one of the other two made it his project to rewrite the article from top to bottom for one of the Wikipedia editing contests. He liberally threw out old unsourced crap and then layered in new, well sourced text. I mentioned on the article talk page I&#x27;d like to fix a few sections of the article, and proofread all of it, and after he deleted the old crap, I put in new good content in the sections I worked on and checked all of his references throughout the article. The former editors who let the article be bad for years slithered away. It&#x27;s a slog and a struggle like this every time someone tries to improve Wikipedia--the established editing culture includes snap judgments without looking up reliable sources.<p>AFTER EDIT: I also mentioned in the previous thread about Wikipedia that I hope sometime soon a philanthropist funds a Free Online Encyclopedia X Prize to put to the test what could be possible in building an accurate, well edited free, online encyclopedia if some new projects began and tried out some new models of project management and perhaps some new software. (I personally don&#x27;t have any trouble dealing with Wikipedia&#x27;s software, but I have been using various kinds of markup languages since the 1980s in earlier editing work.) The only way to know what&#x27;s possible is to try to challenge the incumbent project with some competition, I think. Even if Wikipedia then just ended up winning a prize with reasonable criteria, it would still become better, and we would all have a better idea about what works and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Million_Award"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Million_Award</a>",1451594915

10819598,comment,10814984,10818928,0,0,kanzure,,,"> Whichever direction the majority chooses is the direction of Bitcoin.<p>The whole point of Bitcoin is that you cannot actually measure &quot;majority&quot;, because of problems including censorship and sybil attacks. You can measure hashrate and PoW difficulty, which provides sybil resistance (at least, it can put a minimum cost on sybil attacks), but the Bitcoin protocol uses PoW as a dynamic membership multiparty signature which seems to add the requirement of resource requirement minimization otherwise you get fewer and fewer members in the membership set... Otherwise only high-resource (highly-coercible large-scale) entities can participate in the dynamic membership.<p>In the Bitcoin consensus protocol this is restricted to picking transaction ordering and some other details, but I am hoping to stress to you how the same problems apply even outside of transaction ordering and consensus over Bitcoin transaction history, even if PoW doesn&#x27;t solve those other consensus problems.<p>The same problems (sybil attacks, etc.) apply to measuring &quot;majority&quot; and explain why &quot;number of users&quot; is not being used by Bitcoin Core developers to pick what each Bitcoin Core developer personally wish to work on. (Well, they tend to have their own individual reasons, some that are overlapping with this one, but I want to keep my explanation succinct.)<p>Bitcoin Core developers seem to have little desire to work on hard-fork (in)compatibility changes, although they might be okay with technically-meritorious-uncontroversial hard-forks. This is largely based on a belief of the importance of backwards-compatibility, resource requirement minimization (such as Bitcoin Core node bandwidth requirements), network effects especially in the context of financial asset adoption, decentralization, etc. Also this belief seems to be reinforced by how they don&#x27;t actually control the Bitcoin network anyway, nor its rules, just one of the clients and their releases which users are free to voluntarily use (or choose not to use). Thankfully there are some alternative methods for increasing scalability which are getting deployed on testnet (or a new testnet?) today or tomorrow or something: <a href=""https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases-faq</a><p>Bitcoin users that disagree with Bitcoin consensus protocol rules should consider not using Bitcoin. There are many people at the moment who are not interested in what Bitcoin offers, and that&#x27;s okay. Indeed some users were misled into believing Bitcoin had extremely high levels of anonymity, only to later find out that Bitcoin had a blockchain and a largely pseudonymous design.... While many Bitcoin developers wish this wasn&#x27;t the case, users would be advised to stop using something that doesn&#x27;t actually fit their requirements...... But &quot;secretly&quot; most Bitcoiners suspect that Bitcoin really does meet reasonable standards or requirements :-) so this is why many don&#x27;t advocate disgruntled Bitcoin users to leave.<p>Some suspect that the Bitcoin industry could be coerced (such as by government) or influenced (such as by social media sentiment) to participate in a hard-fork, to specifically choose to become incompatible with the existing widely-deployed Bitcoin consensus protocol rules. Social media sentiment syncing is way cheaper than reading the Bitcoin source code, and anybody can use Bitcoin even without agreeing with the concepts behind the protocol or whatever. Anyway, a hard-fork split is not the end of Bitcoin, because even if Bitcoin-original ends up on a minority hashrate side, hashrate attacks (from the other sides of the hard-fork) can be mitigated by migrating to a different PoW function. Perhaps &quot;adoption&quot; will be reduced as a result (indeed perhaps for all sides of the hard-fork, esp. given wallet/merchant difficulties), but the opportunity for low-difficulty PoW mining will be overwhelmingly appealing to an extremely broad audience, plus the ability to sell UTXOs against exchanges participating on the other side of the hard-fork to fund development of -original, possibility of shaking out maladoption, and what I suspect will be an increasing unwillingness to accept payments from others using the social-media-sentiment hard-forked currency because of the difficulty of judging the technical reliability/stability/value of a currency operated by social-media-sentiment-influenced participants willing to increase incompatibility on the money they are about to pay you with.<p>Majority is not how Bitcoin works, not for transaction ordering, and not for what Bitcoin Core developers want to work on.<p>> At least to me, it sounds much more in line with the original conception of Bitcoin than a central foundation managing its direction.<p>Well, you&#x27;re not wrong :-).",1451594808

You could not entice good employees by offering them a pay raise because it bumped them up into another tax bracket and it just wasn&#x27;t worth it to them.<p>Really hard to take the article seriously when it crams so much misinformation into one paragraph. There is no such thing as &quot;bumping you up into the next tax bracket.&quot; The marginal extra dollar might be taxed at a higher rate, but the dollars below that will be taxed the same as before.<p>Moreover, the fact that health insurance isn&#x27;t taxed now can&#x27;t explain the origin of the industry.

Just to get a sense for Jewish theology, see this quote by rabbi David Hartman: &quot;I never had a clear concept of God. As a people with multiple traditions and different strands, today we stand before a multiplicity of models and are expected to declare which one we identify with&quot;[1]<p>One of the greatest modern Jewish orthodox philosopher, Y Leibowitz[2] (who was a scientist, too; a professor of biochemistry, organic chemistry and neurophysiology), believed that the Jewish god is not even necessarily personal (in the sense that he possesses a persona). He said that all questions about the nature of god are meaningless and idolatrous. He believed that the only relevant question about god is whether it is an entity worthy of worship. I.e. God is &quot;that which should be worshiped&quot;. He also believed that the relationship between God and man is completely one sided and consists solely of man worshiping god, which in Judaism means to observing Halakha. So to him, religion was definitely not an explanation of anything, but an obligation -- a discipline -- one chooses to take upon oneself (and the observance of that obligation = belief in God).<p>Leibowitz believed that his views simply mirrored those of Maimonides&#x27;, who called them (in the 12th cetury) &quot;negative theology&quot;. Simply put, Maimonides said that there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human mind in science and philosophy (simply because the two involve different realms) [3]. He even said that one cannot say that God exists, but only that God is not non-existent (which echoes modern intuitionistic logic, which lacks the axiom of excluded middle).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://hartman.org.il/Blogs_View.asp?Article_Id=33"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hartman.org.il/Blogs_View.asp?Article_Id=33</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshayahu_Leibowitz#Religious_philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshayahu_Leibowitz#Religious_...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides#Negative_theology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides#Negative_theology</a>",1451592935

Why? Because when you get sick you just go the doctor, and if the doctor&#x27;s clinical opinion is that you need additional care, you go to the hospital. There is no financial decision-making involved, there&#x27;s no additional paperwork to be filled out (not by you anyway), and you don&#x27;t have to have conversations about who&#x27;s in or out of your provider network in the normal course of events. The only focus is on your clinical care and recovery needs. Is it perfect, of course not - but when you develop a medical problem, you get to focus on that rather than having to split your attention between medical, financial, and administrative worries. My experience of the American healthcare system is that while there are many sincere and selfless people working in it, the system itself is badly corrupted and wildly inefficient.<p>One objection I&#x27;ve heard from opponents of single payer healthcare is that if going to the doctor is free or almost so, doctor&#x27;s offices will be filled with hypochondriacs and genuinely needy patients will be crowded out. I have never seen any evidence for this claim, and it doesn&#x27;t match my experience. Most people don&#x27;t like going to the doctor because it makes them nervous, it&#x27;s icky, and they dislike being around other sick people in the waiting room - same as everywhere. Of course there are some hypochondriacs out there, and doctors quickly become skilled at spotting them and running them off. It may be a bit harder in these days of WebMd, but I am disinclined to believe that a tiny number of hypochondriacs are the major obstacle to restructuring and industry comprising 10-15% of our economy.",1451592622

So if a block is produced every 10 minutes and the size of a block is limited to 1 MB that limits the transaction throughput of the Bitcoin network.  When the rate of transactions being broadcast by users outstrips the available space in the blocks being mined then there is a backlog and not all the transactions will be mined in a timely fashion.<p>Which transactions get in a block are determined by the miners so the net effect of there not being enough room is that miners pick the transactions with the highest fees to include first. Over time as the Bitcoin network gets very large this will artificially drive up transaction fees to very high levels.  The fact that the block size limit is 1MB was a quick hack in the early days to prevent spam and was always meant to be lifted once Bitcoin gained popularity.<p>Back to Blockstream.  Blockstream is developing a technology generally referred to as &quot;sidechains&quot;.  It would allow users to perform transactions on private blockchains that are pegged to the Bitcoin blockchain.  A sidechain can be thought of as a alt-coin backed by Bitcoin (similar to how paper money might be backed by gold, or the full faith and credit of a powerful government).  Transactions on a sidechain wouldn&#x27;t need to be processed by Bitcoin proper so the sidechain  wouldn&#x27;t be limited by any block size limit in Bitcoin.<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with sidechains and the idea is even kind of cool.  The problem is that Blockstream and those acting on it&#x27;s behalf oppose any increase in blocksize.  This will have the net effect of driving up Bitcoin transaction costs to artificially high levels making it unattractive to use for every day transactions and would relegate Bitcoin to a settlement layer where high value transactions between major financial players take place and nothing else.  Blockstream is hoping this would drive people who still wanted to use Bitcoin to sidechains where there wouldn&#x27;t be a back log.  These sidechains could in turn be controlled by a company or bank for their specific purpose.  ie: you can transact on the Visa sidechain powered by Blockstream.<p>Raising the block size doesn&#x27;t preclude Blockstream from implementing sidechains but keeping the block size small as Bitcoin grows very large will make Blockstream&#x27;s sidechain scheme absolutely necessary.  If the block size were allowed to grow it isn&#x27;t clear if the value proposition of sidechains would be as strong.",1451592224

In this case, the difference between strike price and FMV is $0 and hence tax realized is also $0. This also starts ticker for capital gains sooner and if the company gets sold/IPO after 1 year from date of exercise and 2 year from date of grant then long term capital gains will apply and not short-term capital gains which is taxed as ordinary income.<p>This obviously depends on the strike price on joining the company and how much money employee is okay to lose in case company goes bust.

Presumably, it&#x27;ll be a combination of advertising and collecting commissions for e-commerce transactions made via Facebook.<p>Second, and more importantly, even if Free Basics were completely free, it&#x27;d still be wrong. Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer for free with Windows. They did not do this as an altruistic gesture. They did it to crush Netscape, which was challenging their software monopoly on the desktop. Facebook is doing exactly the same thing with Free Basics. This is not an altruistic gesture by Facebook, regardless of what Mark Zuckerberg writes in his op-ed. This is a calculated move to establish a Facebook monopoly over user data in the largest untapped Internet market in the world. Facebook, with Free Basics, is ensuring that no other social network or messaging platform can challenge it in India.<p>The technology community rightly applauded the US Department of Justice when it initiated anti-trust actions against Microsoft.

In that case, there are definite, objective(ish) standards and rules by which those arguments can come to a resolution of some kind. I suppose in a more hierarchical structure there would be less bureaucracy when there are disagreements and the next person in charge would simply decide which view he thought was more correct.

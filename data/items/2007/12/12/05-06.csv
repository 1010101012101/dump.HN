I believe they use MapQuest, maybe licensed. Yet, FedEx brags that they're beating UPS (growing 15% / year) because FedEx is the more innovative company. I guess this is a wrinkle. <p>At least their routes go clockwise, eliminating ~1 left-hand turn :)",1197438854

88603,comment,88457,88514,0,0,jey,,,"Yes, I fully agree. My question is why we should expect the probability of there being life on Mars to be appreciably above zero. It sounds like wishful thinking.<p>As far as we know, life is not something that happens often nor easily, and there isn't any significant indication that there's life on Mars. So far it seems like we've picked our favorite hypothesis (that there's life on Mars) and are now scurrying around looking for any bits of evidence to support it. ""Oooh look, there's some water! And some silica!""<p>I'll avoid drawing the obvious comparison to creationism. Oops, too late. ;)",1197438308

88588,comment,88272,88558,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I think the YC audience may be more diverse than you realize--there may be many with families and some with grandchildren. Also, starting a family and starting a start-up are both a process. Is it less work when you have 12 employees and a large payroll to meet than when you and your co-founders are still struggling to find the first niche for your product? Both are stressful in different ways. From what I read of PG's quote it's ""I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start a startup. I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just that I don't want to take responsibility for advising it.""",1197436307

88586,comment,88005,88445,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>And every instance of ""child genius"" that has been studied has boiled down to no innate ability, but rigorous practice from an early age.</i><p>Completely laughable, and completely unverifiable. The only passable tests of such things that I am aware of are studies of separated twins, which have indicated quite clearly, time and time again, that variance in intelligence is attributable in great part to inheritance. There's no arguing around such tests--bring up as many chimpanzee breeds that you want.<p><i>Meaning that ""intelligence"" is largely learned, mind is an empty plate of neurons waiting to be connected.</i><p>The oldest error in the discussion.

88585,comment,88370,88370,0,0,RobbieAllen,,,"Many of you are missing the point. (neilc has it right)  I didn't want to achieve straight A's for the sake of achieving straight A's.  It is not like I told anyone (or needed to prove myself to anyone else).  I did it because that was the mark of achieving mastery in the course (now you may disagree with that).  Most of the poeple I knew that claimed to be learning a lot outside of the class curriculum and ended up with C's actually didn't learn very much because they spent more time slacking off than trying to learn.<p>As far as spending time to get A's instead of exploring, I didn't mention it but besides the two internships I also participated in a study aboard at the University of Manchester (England) and traveled all over Europe.  <p>People see this issue as black and white, but trying to get A's does not preclude you from doing other things.  You just have to be willing to put in the time to get A's (ie, learning the subject matter) PLUS do other things. Most people don't have the work ethic.<p>-Robbie",1197435678

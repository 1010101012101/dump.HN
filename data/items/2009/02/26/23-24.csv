Next 12 months they're usual able to be interested by mundane things quite easily, eating an apple could take an hour, that sort of thing; but they learn to walk and so can get away ... 2years+ they can get into just about anything and reach most shelves and aren't easily self occupying (though still having naps so you've some time do stuff). 3+ can sit and do things by themselves without being too much of a danger - though my lads 3.5 and was left for 10 mins while his Mum went to the loo and managed to empty every single toy/game he had into a pile on the floor that took the 3 of us about 45mins to sort out.<p>Somewhere between 4-5 they usually start school ..

Even if those theories are ones that would lead to major increases in scientific funding. Maybe in your conspiracy-theory, wacky-science world 'room temperature fusion' was actually a widely accepted theory but in the actual scientific world it was nothing more than a theory proposed by a few people that was rapidly disproven.

The work is pretty similar at both (research-oriented), though there would be a little more engineering at the startup, and the pay is about the same (depending on what you think of stock options at a startup), so the decision is really boiling down to whether I want to work at a corporation or a startup.<p>I see a couple pros and cons of both (listed below), so I'm curious what other people think.<p>Pros of corporation:\n- More of a '9-5' job, so I have a lot of time to explore thing on my own. (I have projects with friends to play with and a bunch of random stuff I want to learn, like physics and playing the violin.)\n- I'd have more people I'd be working with. (Here, I'd be a member of a research-ish team, whereas at the startup, I'd kinda be a one-man research team. So while I'd interact with a lot of people, it would be more to get engineering ideas or general directions to explore, and I wouldn't really have anyone to bounce research/theory ideas off of.)<p>Cons of corporation:\n- The work itself would be the same as the startup, but the environment itself would probably be less fun.\n- Fewer people my age.<p>Pros of startup:\n- More fun environment.\n- I'd have a more important role (leading a team, rather than being a member of a team).<p>Cons of startup:\n- Probably less time to explore my own things. (Actually, what do Hacker News people think? Do people working at startups usually have a good split between working on their own projects and doing stuff for the startup?)\n- Like I mentioned above, I'm very interested in math and theory, and wouldn't have as much interaction with these kind of folks at the startup, as compared with the large company.<p>Any thoughts?",1235692326

That way, the unique features of the language can be more readily tested in existing tools.  For example, I may have a program with a critical algorithm, that <i>might</i> be faster in a new language; if the language simply links to C, I can easily test <i>that algorithm</i> in the new language, without having to replace the rest of the program and the libraries it uses.<p>Note that I'm not saying it's bad for new languages to be <i>capable</i> of implementing something like a 'string' or 'date' in a simple way.  In fact, such practical examples may help when learning the new language.

I really wish iTunes supported an Audiobook chapter-style interface for these types of tracks.<p>I really like what you guys have done with the interface, and have a fairly good selection of sets. I think the biggest problems are portability and integration.

I also tend to download sets to my iPhone and listen to them in car.<p>I wonder if down the road you could address the portability issue with a iPhone app that mimics your site's UI, and the integration by providing custom streams to iTunes (or winamp, or whatever) that include tracknames in the stream.<p>Do you have any plans to support user-submitted DJ sets?",1235690605

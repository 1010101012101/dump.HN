Something accessible to mere mortals about functional programming probably has the best chance today, given the increasing penetration of related ideas into mainstream programming languages, but while there are some brilliant presenters working in that field, their focus is still typically far too academic for mainstream interest. Something about non-traditional databases, distributed systems, and why certain key problems can't be solved and there are necessarily always trade-offs, might also be applicable to many programmers today, but again I know of no natural figurehead to write a definitive book on the subject.<p>The drop-off in top-notch books also correlates pretty well with the rise of the WWW as a mainstream information source. Of all subjects, computing is one of the fastest evolving and perhaps the most natural candidate to find a home for new information on Web pages rather than paper.

It looks like you're doing some cool stuff, but it doesn't look appealing to me as a developer who is already comfortable with node.<p>The biggest mental leap for me is that you are using JSON objects to define sequential code. JSON defines an object as unordered. Obviously your compiler maintains order properly, however it just ""feels wrong"".<p>Like I said there is no way you can convince me to write code in a browser (unless there is an absolutely magical benefit), so writing fjson manually looks difficult both in the amount of extra syntax, as well as trying to connect the data to what it's doing.<p>The last thing that would hold me back is the debugging experience. Will i get back which lines im my documents are causing runtime errors, is there any static checking in place to make sure the strings of code are syntactically correct?<p>It's a big leap for me, but that being said, I definitely applaud you for developing something new and experimenting. I'm interested in seeing where this evolves.",1323219923

That would be silly, as we obviously don't have a theory of ""all social behavior given all data"".<p>Rather, it looks like a general research platform for social simulations. The various models could be broad or narrow in scope, well proven or highly speculative. Perhaps some models will also be built on the output of other models. With all the models and all the data in one place, hopefully it would start to become clear which are accurate.",1323219666

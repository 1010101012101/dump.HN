You can do mixins & monkey patching very easily with ObjC as well.  I would say ObjC rates very well in terms of flexibility of development.<p>ObjC is definitely more enjoyable than Java or C++ and just slightly less efficient than ruby/python.  ObjC feels closer to ruby/smalltalk than it does to python.  If I had my choice of language, I'd probably choose javascript or ruby, but ObjC comes close in second.<p>Even if you hate Apple, you should consider looking at ObjC on GNUStep.",1270832376

In classical logic, if you have a set S={X,Y,Z,...} of <i>n</i> variables, your state of knowledge is a map from S to {true, false}. Thus there are 2^<i>n</i> possibilities.<p>The usual idea is to say that false=0 and true=1. Then one tries to model uncertainty with intermediate numerical values, replacing 2^<i>n</i> discrete possibilities with an <i>n</i>-dimensional space. This doesn't work and Bayesian reasoning does something else.<p>With <i>n</i> variables there are 2^<i>n</i> basic conjunctions. This will be familiar from writing out truth tables, or perhaps from <i>not</i> writing out truth tables because they contain too many lines. The Bayesian approach assigns a probability to every basic conjunction and thus lives in a 2^<i>n</i> dimensional space.<p>How can Bayes rule <i>extend</i> logic when it appears to be simpler?

1253166,comment,1250799,1251111,0,0,jcl,,,"The least cynical explanation -- and thus the one most likely to be put forward by Apple -- is that by banning cross-platform compatibility layers, developers are forced to focus expressly on the iPad/iPhone platform, which reduces the likelihood of platform-specific bugs and keeps the developer from cutting corners to remain platform-agnostic (such as introducing foreign UI conventions).  Likewise, they can claim that by requiring C/C++ they ensure high performance and efficient use of resources, resulting in better a end-user experience.<p>A more cynical theory: Apple believes they have more than enough developers for their platform, and they need a way to raise the bar.  Particularly, they need to limit the pile of me-too apps, and Flash's impending iPhone compatibility threatens to send nothing but.<p>The benefit to the user in this case is that they have less crap to wade through in the App Store.  The harm to the user is that a highly desirable app does not get made for the Apple platform because the developer is put off.  And that risk is spectacularly low: any popular app on another platform is quickly cloned, and any killer app that fails to materialize at all... well, the users would never know what they're missing.  (The logic breaks down for expensive-to-develop apps, game franchises, and other forms of lock-in, but these cases are few; Apple can negotiate them on a case-by-case basis.)",1270831500

There are some real typographic nits in it..."".<p>What you call nitpicking, I'm calling attention to detail.<p>I agree with you that their industrial design is top grade. Is it the most important differentiator? I dunno, anecdotally I don't know anybody that cares that the baseplate of the new Macbooks is a single piece of machined aluminum. Are all the buttons in the right places and is it pleasant to use and look at? I think those are important, and it's amazing how often that's done poorly.<p>But holding up absolutely meaningless marketing nonsense as a prime example of why Apple is the superior design shop, principally because it embodies the concept of ""attention to detail"" and then completely dismissing something that's actually important like ""can I actually read the text on the screen"" is nonsense. Really, nobody cares that the time is supposed to coincide  with the big reveal at Macworld. But people <i>do</i> care if they put down 500-800 dollars on an iPad so they could download and read books and the table of contents is all over the page and they have to stop reading it after 20 minutes because the typography is a disaster.<p>We both agree that design is an important factor in product development.<p>I think we also both agree that attention to detail is an important factor in product development.<p>We also both probably agree that there are only so many resources you can through at a product's design, so compromises have to be made.<p>This is where we disagree (and this is why places like HN are interesting), you favor the external design of the product. How it looks on the shelf. Does it catch the eye of the consumer? You're even ok with letting other aspects of the product slip if it allows for a bit more time to go into small details of the packaging. I'm not saying this is bad or dumb or whatnot. But I am making the argument that you have to at least acknowledge that other areas are slipping -- something you and other Apple fanboys seem completely unable or unwilling to do. Basically there are no flaws in what Apple produces. Every one of Steve Jobs' and Jonathan Ive's babies is born perfect and without flaw. Anybody who says other than that doesn't ""get it"", is jealous or is a nitpicker.<p>I think that ultimately the utility of the device is more important. I'm willing to live with a little bit of ugliness in the package if the overall device is more useful. If I can use it for hours without fatigue, if I can do useful things I want or need to do with it, etc. If I have to have one more button on the bezel to accomplish that, that's fine. If I have to have a port on the back of the device so I can swap batteries, or stick in an SD card or plug in a usb device, that's okay by me. I don't want those things to diminish the device, I don't want the extra button slapped haphazardly in the middle of the screen for example. Or the door to the battery compartment to weigh 2 pounds. But those things are important. To me, and to other users.<p>Just because there are flaws in a product, does not make a product bad. It makes the product real. Putting blinders on, becoming an apologist for things lacking, dismissing valid issues, introduces you to group think, fantastical thinking, circular reasoning, self justification and fanboydom among other flaws in thinking; not to critical thinking and objective analysis.",1270831426

1253161,comment,1250958,1251625,0,0,spokey,,,"I think the other bit he missed was the early focus Sun placed on Java Applets. I think they initially saw Java and JVM primarily as platform for distributing client side code to web browsers, to set-top boxes, to mobile phones, etc.  In this way Sun's focus on Java is analogous to Netscape's efforts to distribute a free web browser--they are trying to commoditize the client to sell more servers.<p>Of course, as it played out Java got a lot more traction on the server side than the client side. (I think the ability to easily develop on Windows and deploy to Unix/Linux played a role in that.) But by 2002 Java had already pretty much lost on the browser side, supplanted by Flash and later robust JavaScript.  I think 2002 might have been the thick of their JavaME (mobile platform) efforts though.",1270831393

Instinctively, though, the apparent arrogance behind Apple's methods of throwing sharp elbows toward competitors has all the feel of what Microsoft did in the 1990s as it used its desktop OS leverage to favor MS Office/Internet Explorer, etc. and to harm independent software vendors trying to market their apps for the PC market.

1253052,comment,1252763,1252763,0,0,strlen,,,"""Build only the tools you need as the need arises.""<p>This is certainly true, although some form of generic infrastructure is still universally needed: most importantly operations, build, test and deploy tools. These tools allow for ability to iterate much quicker.  Much of the foundation for this infrastructure is now available as open source, which means it's not difficult to customize to a start-ups needs (no need to build from scratch): git SCM, puppet/chef/bcfg2 for configuration management, nagios for alerting, capistrano for deployment, hudson CI, etc...<p>There's also a corollary to this statement: when you <i>need</i> infrastructure, you shouldn't shy away from building it. First-class, productivity increasing tools and infrastructure distinguishes great software companies from average ones. It also requires strong engineering teams and is often indicative of such (great heuristic when deciding to go to a start-up or not: have they done anything beyond reading from a database and outputting to a screen?).<p>I've seen companies whose solution to infrastructure woes had been to shell for expensive solutions commercial (or very ill fitting open source ones) and then <i>force</i> development teams to use them (""you must build this using Oracle SOA, oh and convert the build system to maven while you're at it; we know it sucks, but we've made this choice""), even when these solutions reduced developer and operations productivity.<p>On the other hand, I've also seen companies develop own infrastructure when open source solutions met their needs very well, <i>again</i> reducing developer productivity and forcing these systems on engineering teams due to the sunken costs fallacy (""yes, we know there's Protocol Buffers and Thrift, but you <i>must</i> use our custom binary XML parser!"").<p>The reason Google, Amazon and Yahoo succeeded with small teams and stayed alive during a <i>major</i> cash crunch (the dot com crash) is partly due to ability to make effective ""build vs. buy"" decisions when it came to infrastructure (e.g., using off the shelf RDBMS for ""back office"" applications like billing and order management, while building their own systems for low latency, high throughput, high scalability applications). Companies that were relying on shelling out for rows of expensive load balancers, Sun E450/E10k servers and Oracle RDBMS licenses went under.",1270829173

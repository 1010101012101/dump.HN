330546,comment,330521,330521,0,0,quasimojo,,,"no, we are not the ones to ""solve"" it, because there is no button to push, method to be invented, or novel approach to making everyone solvent with web technology.<p>what we are, we're the people who will live with reduced wealth for decades to come. debt must be unwound and asset prices reverted to the mean. there is no shortcut. regimes that have taken shortcuts have ended violently. for example, monarchist france and weimar germany.<p>we are, ONCE AGAIN (like 2002), attempting to put off (inevitable) deflation with hyperinflation. or do you think pumping like $3 trillion globally into markets will have no impact on currencies? the dollar will not make it to 2025",1223852208
330545,comment,330521,330521,0,0,m0nty,,,"""Sure this is a startup-forum so it effects funding etc but still.""<p>It affects just about everything. I remember during the last big downturn, there was a piece on the BBC about a couple who had lost everything they had, in part because she had been a Herbalife [v. big in the 80s] sales person, and (as she put it) ""when people are feeling the pinch the first thing they can do without is a herbal dietary supplement."" Her business died almost overnight.<p>Now, maybe your startup idea is about something which gives real value and reduces costs of some vital business process. But if it's not, this will bite you very hard indeed. And even if it is, you might still find your potential customers are very cost-averse.<p>Personally, I see this downturn as a big opportunity, but it will be accompanied by plenty of pain first.",1223852141

330543,comment,330375,330484,0,0,netcan,,,"I think it's more then that. Some sites, it makes a lot of sense to look at something, go back to the homepage (or another main page). Others try to let you roam. Move from product to product, related topics, add on products, see the forum, most popular in this category.... You follow a loose trail.",1223851881

In addition, this is a news event of immense scale. The global economy is probably melting down.<p><i>We are the guys and girls that solve this...</i><p>That depends, I guess, on if we're the kind of people who keep others in houses, lend to banks, evaluate debtor's credit rating, produce the things people need in order to live, or have the intellect and authority to make the right policy decisions in this frankly harrowing time.<p>If a meltdown really happens, starting up will be a whole different ball game. Changing currency valuations will strongly influence things like who gets to be an industrial economy vs. who gets to be a service economy, who gets to have functioning infrastructure and who doesn't, and who can afford food and energy.<p>Though we are all a little disaster-fatigued, the global financial freeze-up that could wreak havoc on our abilities to make a living surely warrants attention on the front page.",1223851772

330537,comment,330470,330528,0,0,skmurphy,,,"For things in the realm of an idealized problem solving domain, say mathematics or chess, you can learn a lot from a proverb. But many insights in life can't be reduced to writing, especially those involving either self-mastery or other people (and startups, alas, involve both).<p>If you read the history of an event how does that compare to living through it? Can you learn to ride a bike from a book? The challenge with a startup--like many other things in life--is that you need to integrate many different inputs, your own hopes and fears among them, and negotiate a working consensus with your co-founders.",1223851423

It helps me for reading comprehension, later referencing, and those off line meetings where you want to show something quickly out of your printed notes.",1223851341
330535,comment,330470,330470,0,0,breck,,,"First, thanks for sharing. It's really hard to talk about past failures and yet so valuable. I learned more from your story than reading 20 ""How to Succeed"" articles.<p>Second, I just want to share one thing I've learned. There's a lot of pyschology mumbo jumbo in your analysis but <i>all</i> that really matters is the numbers. How many pageviews/users/sales/conversions did you have? Etc.<p>One thing I've learned about Internet startups is that you <i>absolutely cannot force them</i>. The market dictates your success plain and simple. It sounds like you guys weren't listening to the market; you were not paying enough attention to the numbers.  That's really the only thing you should pay attention to. A month into my startup last year, one of the co-founders said to me and the other partner:<p>Him: ""Guys, I've discovered a pattern in our traffic."" \nMe: ""Well, what is it?""\nHim: ""Every week it decreases.""\nMe: (Proceed to ignore the importance of this simple statement and pursue the idea for 5 more months, believing that because we had a good team and <i>we</i> thought the idea was good we could succeed, which was too bad because from month 1 the market was giving us PRICELESS advice--we should have been working on a different idea)<p>Every other mistake was irrelevant because the only thing that matters is the numbers.",1223851242

There comes a point (above about 35%, I think) where government services will have to be cut to continue servicing the debt.<p>edit: excuse me, 35% of gov budget.  Just like a household.",1223851075

If the US outright repudiates debt in war, the value of the dollar would take a plunge and solders, even the patriotic ones, like to get paid for risking their lives. Furthermore, weapons and supplies are extremely expensive.<p>When war breaks out, money is one of the biggest problems.

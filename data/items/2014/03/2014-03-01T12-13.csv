Indeed, what the gall has the shareholder to ask the executive how much the policy costs him! One should soundly reject this novel and outrageous concept of executives reporting to shareholders the actual results of their pet policies. The less shareholders know, the better. Especially when it comes to the question if the decisions taken by the management rely on public subsidies - shareholders don&#x27;t need to know if their wellbeing depends on taxpayer-funded handouts, that would only disturb them.

Serious companies disproportionately can actually attempt to pay market rates for engineering services.  Signaling desire to be paid in Bitcoin tells serious companies &quot;I do not wish to do business with serious companies.&quot; and, while it won&#x27;t convince them to pay you in Bitcoin since no power under earth or heaven will do that, it might convince their decisionmakers to go with someone who is not a joker for their professional services.  This will cause you to systematically get paid far below-market rates for your services.<p>Why won&#x27;t serious companies pay you in Bitcoin?  Let us count the reasons:<p>1)  Why should they?  They already have a bank account, which can issue checks and wires.  This is what they use to pay substantially everyone.<p>2)  They have layers of processes and scar tissue built up around payments, precisely to make sure that something like &quot;And then the bookkeeper looted 80% of our assets without us knowing it&quot; could never happen.  None of these processes contemplate Bitcoin.  They&#x27;re the bones and sinews of the company.  You will <i>not</i> succeed in changing them from the outside.  As tptacek how likely you are to even alter fairly inconsequential details of a large company&#x27;s procurement process, like how long it takes them to physically issue a physical check which all parties know only actually takes a minute of typing and Ctrl-P to create.<p>3)  Serious companies have serious professional advisors like lawyers and accountants, and serious professional advisors are very risk adverse.  They&#x27;re going to come up with all sorts of perfectly serious reasons why issuing payments in Bitcoin is a high-risk low-reward activity.  For instance, in Japan, you need to keep your books in yen.  That&#x27;s non-negotiable.  Even if the numbers you use for management of the company in something really exotic like dollars, the official books must be in yen, and the National Tax Agency will occasionally ask you for line-by-line justifications.  Your accountant is going to hear &quot;Bitcoin transaction&quot; and start trying to fit that into double-entered yen based bookkeeping, and if he actually understands what Bitcoin is doing, he&#x27;s going to say &quot;This sounds like a whole heck of a lot of work.  Why don&#x27;t we just pay them via wire transfer like we always do?  Also, I&#x27;m having difficulty valuing 100 BTC for the purpose of paying withholding taxes on our payment to him.  I sort of don&#x27;t want to lose my license for assisting with tax evasion -- can we <i>please</i> pay with a wire transfer?&quot;<p>If you desire to speculate in Bitcoin, you can acquire it in the same fashion as you buy Magic Cards, Beanie Babies, or shares in Google: get paid in dollars, then buy the thing from people who sell it for dollars.

7324058,comment,7322912,7322912,13,0,pron,,,"This case is a beautiful demonstration of the dynamics of both  &quot;free market&quot; and regulation. Free market dynamics demand (in this case as in all cases) that large players must never compete on prices or wages (as your competitors have the resources to fight back, so competition on price just makes everyone worse off). On the other hand, regulation was used both to stop an exploitation by the market (antitrust), as well as a tool wielded by capitalists to strengthen their stranglehold (patents).<p>It is perhaps worth reminding that the interplay between regulators and the market, and their co-evolution, have taken a different historical path than in Europe. While in Europe big government preceded laissez-faire, or at least, evolved hand-in-hand, the US was largely unregulated for many years. The result was that Ayn Randian titans took control of pretty much all power in the US, advancing the &quot;economy&quot; but at the same time practically enslaving the population. It was after many years of cries for help by the American people, and a long struggle led largely by the press, that Teddy Roosevelt was able to strengthen the government, wrestle back some power, and save the people from feudalist oppression.<p>Ironically, many Americans forgot what the US looked like when the government was powerless, and the market was allowed to roam free. People like Ayn Rand, who sadly came to the US just as the wheel was turning, didn&#x27;t see the suffering that their romantic fantasies had brought about when playing out in the real world.<p>Obviously, as patent law demonstrates, regulation can be (and is) abused by capitalists. As the world changes, power shifts, and players adapt new strategies in this constant power struggle, both the market and regulation need to evolve hand-on-hand. The big question is what will play the role the press once played in exposing the workings of the intricate system of interests that is the economy?",1393677768

It&#x27;s comments like this which lead to defeatist attitudes and a lack of push-back (which, unsurprisingly, becomes self-fulfiling).<p>Options include:<p>- Engaging in the political process. What&#x27;s the point of democracy if people are unwilling to use it?  There are so many fringe interest groups that have managed to get their way because they&#x27;ve figured the system out and how to play it.  It&#x27;s fucking irritating when smart technical people simply write off this piece of the process.  If you want to &#x27;hack some (non-computer) system to your advantage&#x27;, let it be this one.<p>- Advocate for and try to use secure technologies.  Security on the internet is a farce and ordinary people are constantly misinformed or poorly educated on the issue.  Even developers don&#x27;t get it right.  It&#x27;s in this state because the hard work of coming up with secure crypto is only <i>a third</i> of the problem.  Another third is making it <i>useable</i> by normal people/devs and the final third is actually working on getting <i>adoption</i> of products and services that incorporate it.  Of course, this directly conflicts with any business model based on advertising so it&#x27;s time for new models too. Anything that gets decent crypto usable and widely deployed is a good thing for everyone.<p>- Understand that &#x27;privacy&#x27; is a multi-faceted thing (and help others understand).  It&#x27;s completely ridiculous and unhelpful to talk about it in binary terms and it&#x27;s made worse when people confuse privacy with anonymity.  There&#x27;s a scale on which people treat these things which is obvious when you consider <i>behaviour</i> rather what people say about it.<p>Change doesn&#x27;t occur overnight, it takes schlep and conviction.",1393676884

(In which the speaker had lots of experience in embedded linux security and no experience in car electronics, so he decided to hack the linux-driven hands-free set in his Volkswagen car. He was able to send messages via CAN bus that appeared on the info display on the dash board.)<p>First of all, the linux PC was firewalled with a CAN transceiver that dropped any malformed messages to account for bugs in the linux box. Secondly, all other CAN devices on that bus are designed to withstand any erroneous messages. Thirdly, this was just the infotainment bus. There are three separated busses in the car, the first of which has ABS, ESP and the motor controller talking to each other, the second has semi-important things like window lifters and probably AC on it while the third and least important is the infotainment one. The linux box was allowed to be configured so badly precisely because it couldn&#x27;t harm anybody.<p>I sat next to a Volkswagen engineer in that talk, and he wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed with what the guy on stage achieved on the car side of things, but rather with how much he was able to learn so quickly, and how easily he opened up that random Nokia box. Keep in mind he owned the box, not the car.<p>Volkswagen tests all of these busses and devices exhaustively. They do have to pass TÜV certification, but more to the point they don&#x27;t want any expensive bugs to happen. You can be sure that IT security is taken very seriously on that front. (Also consider that once you are inside the car, you by and large own it already, so discussing further CAN bus attacks would be derailing. The attack vector here is through a firewalled device on an unimportant bus.)",1393676757

290628,comment,290478,290478,0,0,DenisM,,,"Somehow angelsoft has slipped under my radar. This is seriously cool, I am soo applying.<p>Basically, this is one place where a lot of angels congregate, attracted by convenient deal-tracking software and a social network. Entreprenuers can discover angles and apply in a centralized fashion. This aligns with PG's vision of turning demo day into an auction, it's not quite there yet but it's on the right track - creating a global market place for the statups and capital.<p>Thank you waleedka for posting this.",1220061026

290624,comment,290216,290216,0,0,seriouslywtf,,,"I would recommend against it.<p>I had it done and although technically I have better than 20/20 it took me nearly 8 months to adjust to the difference.<p>To me it's a different way of seeing and my mind had to come to terms that it wasn't the same (if you switch from glasses to contacts you have an idea of what I'm talking about).<p>The problem is that I'm not really sure it's better than with my glasses.  Definitely better than with my contacts.<p>I find it hard to distinguish objects as quickly as before in dusk and dawn situations.<p>Bottom-line, as this is for cosmetic/convenience reasons stay away.  You need to be prepared for changes.<p>BTW - Although I can pass an eye exam for 20/10 or so, I feel that I'm guessing more than I was with glasses, even though I could only do 20/15 with glasses.  I can't describe any better than it's a different way of seeing.",1220060250

290618,comment,290342,290342,0,0,staunch,,,"This is why I would never be an employee with a measly .5% unless: a. I wasn't ready to do my own startup or 2. I _really_ thought the company could be the next Google.<p>I do think this part is a bit wrong: <i>""If you’re getting paid market value, then… Well, there’s no risk– and you shouldn’t be expecting much reward.""</i><p>I don't think that's the right way to look at it. Working for a startup at your market rate is not the equivalent risk to working at an established company at your market rate. The floor can fall out at any point for almost any reason.<p>Also, a really great hacker doesn't have to settle for market rate salary alone. He could be at some other startup that's very early stage or simply values him highly enough to pay a market salary and give him a generous equity allotment.",1220059188

For example, you could pick a sacrificial group of users, and expose them to the most awful sound you can come with -- chalk screeches and cats through band saws and ""Hey everybody I'm jacking to child porn!"" and animal yelps and human moaning and stuff like that.  Then you could compare how many of them never come back, to a control group that was not assaulted.",1220058975
290615,comment,290342,290601,0,0,gleb,,,"Cash compensation, yes.  Total compensation -- I am arguing otherwise.  SV engineers are asked to take more risk, and perhaps to sacrifice quality of life more.  Thus higher expected compensation.  That $175k in NY is probably $200k after bonus, so it makes sense that SV would be more.<p>Another way to look at it is that new grad is now close to $100k.  The experienced guy is easily 10 times more productive.  But only gets 1.5 in salary.  So, he also gets 5-10 times as much equity, and that's valued because historically it made good money.",1220058973

My grandfather, now 75 years old, just started using the Internet thanks to the iPad.

He loves it so much, that he got himself a 16Mbit connection after three months. To make something like that happen, that's a major feat.

And they shouldn't have to.<p>As for the price tag - that argument is as lame as it is old. Start comparing other high-end vendors and models and you'll have your epiphany.

It's right that ARM has lower power draw than x86. The article is wrong by how much, though. Very low power ARM chips draw much, much less than 2-3 watts. These are mostly for embedded systems, though.<p>The 2-3 watts vs 5 watts for ARM vs Atom isn't too significant. The big problem with Atom <i>was</i> that the support systems (memory controller etc) draw ~20 watts. That situation is being improved for netbook systems atm.<p>For sub-netbook systems, Intel is launching it's Moorestown architecture. This is probably still isn't dropping into the Smartphone market in this generation (despite Intel's marketing: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/01/moblin-linux-on-x86-smartphone-intels-small-step-forward.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/01/moblin-linux...</a>), but should be great for tablets: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/05/intel-fires-opening-salvo-in-x86-vs-arm-smartphone-wars.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/05/intel-fires-open...</a><p>The article also implies that Intel's foundries are a liability. That would be true if there really was useful ""competition in the foundry market"". Sure, if you want 45nm+ chips produced, there are a number of foundries that can do it. But once you start looking for 32nm foundries they get a lot rarer, and Intel has just announced it's building its new 22nm foundries. That's a whole generation ahead of anyone else in the industry and is a big competitive advantage (Smaller scale in chip foundries means more performance for the same power, or less power for the same performance.)",1287698218

The Genetic Algorithm is an algorithm, not a particular representation of candidate solutions (vectors, lists, trees, whatever).  Likewise Koza-style Genetic Programming isn't an algorithm at all: but largely a representation.<p>That seems pedantic, since of course GAs have certain classic representations and GP has a certain traditional algorithm.  But it's important in this case, because (1) non-tree representations can be used handily to evolve code: for example, see machine-code GP or Grammatical Evolution, both of which use GA-style lists.  And (2) because to my knowledge there's little in GP which would support the claim that ""every part of the replication process is simultaneously optimizing"".<p>Or maybe he meant that Koza-style tree GP was providing ""redundancy"" (in the form of introns), which is odd since this is hardly viewed as a positive: but at any rate, introns exist in all sorts of GA representations, such as machine-code GP lists.<p>At any rate, there seems to be a lot of confusion there.",1287697887
1817595,comment,1816191,1817046,0,0,GHFigs,,,"The trouble with your question is that you've left out any mention of the .dmg that the user actually downloaded.<p>Don't get me wrong, I like disk images as much as the next nerd, but it has been my observation that there are way too many ways for the process of getting from .dmg to in-dock-ready-to-rock to go awry. People can and do figure it out, but the process is still far from optimal.<p>""Internet Enabled"" disk images were an attempt to deal with this, but not every application ships as one, not every browser supports them, and plenty of people have the auto-open option turned off in Safari either because they think it's obnoxious or insecure. (And even if it works perfectly--even if the .dmg turns directly into an .app--the .app ends up in ~/Downloads/. Where for some it will forever remain.)<p>So you're left, at least some of the time, with this file icon with a weird silvery box thing on it. If you're lucky (""you"" being both CEO of n00b, Inc. <i>and</i> Mayor of n00btown) the download page of the application (or if you figured out how to mount the .dmg, within the .dmg itself) you just downloaded has instructions on where to go from here. (Instructions which you, Hacker News reader, have seen a million times without ever really noticing that they are a symptom of a problem.)<p>But let's suppose there are no instructions. But you can figure this out. You're <i>Mayor</i> of N00btown, after all. So you double-click the .dmg and here's a new window, and <i>yay</i>, there's the app icon. ::click click::. Yay! Bouncing icon in the Dock! It works! And it will probably continue to work just fine...until you shut down or restart (which could be six months from now--given how busy and productive you all are at n00b, Inc. you can't afford to waste time every week on ""Software Updates"") at which point your disk images unmount and suddenly some of your programs just don't work anymore! So you download them again...<p>The thing is, none of this (the many ways users can fail with installation) is so disastrous or commonplace that it constitutes an Obvious Problem that Must Be Addressed. Even in the above scenario (which is only a little contrived) the applications still actually <i>work</i>. The user is not confused, but there is still a pathology at play. The user does not go complain to their nerd until things actually fail, and the nerd typically puts a band-aid on it and asks the user to stop doing the wrong thing, while the root problem persists.<p>My point being that even if the "".app inside a .dmg"" approach to installation isn't ""extremely confusing"" (and I would agree, even after the above, that it is not) it still has an unnecessary capacity for undesirable side effects (including confusion) that you don't see with an app store or repository approach.",1287697877

Arithmetic errors (or memory errors) tend not to just mess up insignificant bits.  If it occurs on integer data, then your program will probably seg-fault (because integers are usually indices into arrays) and if it occurs in floating point data, you are likely to either produce a tiny value (perhaps making a system singular) or a very large one.  If you are solving an aerodynamic problem and compute a pressure of 10^80, then you have might as well have a supernova on the leading edge of your wing.  And flipping a minor bit in a structural dynamics simulation could easily be the difference between the building standing and falling.<p>I would argue that data mining is actually more tolerant of such undetected errors because they are more likely to remain local and may stand out as obviously erroneous.

Just shooting photos. I've also since notice it doesn't even have an SD card slot so I have to rely on the slower USB connection from my camera (and carry around yet another cable). And yet the 11"" completely doesn't fulfill my rather modest requirements, even at 3x as much as something that minimally <i>does</i>.<p>So taking pictures is right out.<p>What can I do with it? Apple's own marketing copy pretty much describes hauling it around for writing stuff (blogs, slides, etc.). I suppose one can use a web browser with it. So there you go...the description of a netbook. That's Apple's expected use case for the 11"" MBA. Welcome to $1200 netbook land.<p>But at least it's thin! Because it was always so hard to find space in my backpack for my 1.14"" thick netbook. Man, the number of times I've lamented, ""if only I could get half of that thickness back! I could jam another dozen sheets of paper in there!""<p>Seriously, this isn't religion, it's a computer. Come off it and drop the fundamentalism.",1287695208

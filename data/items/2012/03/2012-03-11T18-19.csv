3690964,comment,3690481,3690889,8,0,rprasad,,,"Most clients choose not to go to trial, <i>despite</i> their court-appointed lawyer's advice to take it to trial.  In SoCal, only about 1 out of every 100 (or more) criminal cases actually goes to trial because the defendants choose not to assert their rights.  What's worse, in more than half of these cases, there is a fatal defect in the prosecution's case (usually non-existent evidence of an element of the charge) that would have gotten the case thrown out before trial if only the defendant had not chosen to plead.  Frequently, this is because the type of people who rely on court-appointed lawyers are guilty (and freely admit to being guilty), and simply want to reduce the sentencing as much as possible.<p>Private criminal defense attorneys usually advise their clients to plead, because (1) they make less money overall if the case goes to trial, and (2) their clients usually have too much at stake to risk tossing the dice on a jury.  Thus, such cases only go to trial when the DA refuses to accept a reasonable plea bargain.<p>Also, your reliance on large law firms is misplaced.  Most lawyers in law firms, even in the litigation groups, <i>have never gone to trial</i>.  Indeed, their closest exposure to trial is usually arguing motions for civil cases, where the procedural and substantive rules are completely different.  Life is not like T.V. (<i>Good Wife</i>, I'm looking at you.)  The end result would be a lot of inexperienced lawyers making a lot of rookie mistakes.  While this could nuke the system, the more likely effect is that the first few defendants would get thoroughly screwed, and the remaining defendants would opt to plea bargain out of ear of getting one of the inexperienced private lawyers.<p>Finally, with enough money, i.e., the money that would be used to hire the large law firm, you could simply <i>fix the system</i>, at least at the county level.",1331492301

3690961,comment,3690481,3690910,2,0,rglullis,,,"Again, I understand that. My thought is about crashing the system by abusing another kind of ""impracticality"": having so many people going to jail at once would grind it to a halt.<p>It doesn't have to be just SOPA or copyright stuff. Take the war on drugs. Abortion. Illegal immigration.<p>Get all women who had an illegal abortion and doctors who performed one, and get them organized to ask to go to jail. Get anyone who used any illegal drug, and organize them to go to jail. Get all illegal immigrants and organize them to demand deportation back to their countries.<p>In any of these examples, I'd guess that people would simply DoS the system. The laws would have to be revised, and they would get actual change to the system just by following it through.",1331492192

I will jump all over the map and ask about as many different aspects of a topic as I can, hoping to map out where the depth of knowledge is for a candidate. If I am getting mostly blank stares I then give them the opportunity to decide what to tell me about the subject, in case they can surprise me. Unfortunately the vast majority of the time candidates are unable to convince me that they have deep knowledge on a subject. I want to find qualified people as much as these people would like to be considered qualified. But sometimes I feel like I throw a bunch of stuff at the candidate and NOTHING sticks.<p>I am beginning to believe that the majority of people who consider themselves experts or experienced are really just novice or intermediate and don't realize how deep the rabbit hole goes.",1331492135

However, the counter to clarity is that it might be a bit too clean for the real world, and that was apparent when answering the questions about copyright at the end.<p>I realize that pg wasn't particularly prepared to be dealing with questions unrelated to the talk, but it was the first time I've seen him not easily handle questions with grace. His responses came off as glib and eventually he had to qualify and edit his previous statements to provide somewhat of a satisfactory response.<p>It's easy to over-believe ideas that are put forth with clarity and match your natural disposition towards clean logic and historical examples. Though pg has intriguing and useful perspectives, I encourage people to study these problems far more in-depth before forming a personal opinion.<p>On a somewhat related note, it was alarming that pg didn't have a clear moral position when asked about his decision-making process.

I've started using it with my 8-year old daughter to practice math and she loves it.<p>That being said, I have a few criticisms of the iPad app:<p>1. The title of ""Watch. Practice. Learn almost anything for free"" is deceptive. I think the strongest point of the Khan Academy web site is the practice section but it's not available on the iPad app.<p>2. The transcript is way too granular. It makes it hard to read and it makes the transcript really long in some cases. Breaking it out by paragraph (instead of every 3-5 seconds) would make it more readable. I don't even think the timestamp needs to be shown.<p>3. It'd be nice to see the directed acyclic graph of lesson dependencies like they have on the site. It's hard to know where to start when you have 2,800 videos.<p>Great job putting out the app though!

So, the only hurdle is $$$.<p>A more measured, focused version of this idea would be to start with a recruiter, a lawyer and a site: JobsInCountryX.com.

3690907,comment,3690481,3690481,70,0,rprasad,,,"I worked for the Public Defender during an election year.  The local D.A. was trying to divert attention from a sex scandal and instructed the ADAs not to negotiate down on any crimes so that he could ""look tough"" on crime.  The thinking was that most criminal defendants would cave and he would get a boost with the mostly-conservative voters of the county.<p>So the lawyers of the Public Defender (and a good portion of the private criminal defense bar) banded together and convinced about a quarter of our clients to go to trial (up from 1 in every 100 or so).  I worked in a specialty division (mentally ""disordered"" defendants) where we got to make the decisions for our clients, and we took almost every case to trial.<p>We also made sure that every defendant going to trial refused to waive his right to a speedy trial, meaning that cases had to go to trial within about 2-3 months or they would get thrown out.<p>The consequences? 
(1) To avoid speedy-trial issues, the D.A.'s office had to transfer cases out to the boonies of our county whereever there were available courtrooms for trials, and ADA's unfamiliar with these cases would take them to trial.  They either lost these cases at trial or watched them get thrown out when they could not start on time (frequently, because their expert witnesses could not schedule court appearances on such short notice).
(2) A backlog of criminal and MD cases that jammed up the court docket, pushing back other cases (i.e., civil lawsuits) 5 years <i>or more</i>.  2009 to 2010 was not a good time to file a lawsuit in that county.
(3) An enraged judiciary that began throwing out criminal cases with wild abandon, including almost all drug possession cases, nonviolent misdemeanors, and lower-level non-violent felonies.
(4) The D.A. lost his reelection campaign, by double-digits.<p>The nuclear option worked, and the next D.A. rescinded the non-negotiation order.<p><i>EDIT: I should point out that this worked because massive budget reductions to the court system during this time period artificially reduced the number of courts in the county.  Without those budget reductions, we would have needed many more trial-ready cases to nuke the system.</i>",1331491060

Which was quite interesting because we couldn't be held responsible for actually taking the pictures.<p>Well the group went viral in a matter of a few days, first a hundred, then a few hundred, then 2-3k.  And in a relatively small southern town, around 13k people, that's a pretty big deal.<p>It was crazy.  I felt like Julian Assange for a couple weeks.  Nervously posting things and worried about the school big dogs hunting me down.  (of course this wasn't anything like WL, but the same idea.)  Parents were starting to be like, ""Wait, why are these students sleeping? What are the teachers doing about this?"" and this in turn caused a big uproar in the school.  Schools hate bad publicity.  The next day I get called into the office and a couple assistant principals and a police officer were like, ""Do you have permission from all these students parents to upload these pictures?"" and I said, ""No. I didn't think you needed it.""  They in turn told me that the school was liable for a law suit, yada yada, and that I need to delete it.<p>They had me login to my account in front of them and delete it.  THIS WAS MY BIGGEST MISTAKE.  Damn it.  I was furious with myself afterwards.  Lesson learned I suppose.  It didn't take long for an outsider to the school to approach me and make another joint account.  That way if it's outside the school they can't do anything.<p>At this point local news agencies were calling me and emailing me asking to interview.  It was on the front page of newspapers.  I learned that it is indeed not illegal to take pictures of minors in a public place and the school was just BS'ing me to get me to delete it.  I was a little scared in that office. I was in contact with the ACLU and a digital rights lawyer in San Francisco, just in case they issued any kind of punishment toward me.<p>It went on for a couple more weeks, we even had tshirts made, and then bam, Facebook shuts it down.

It doesn't. The government can not forbid you from shouting fire in a crowded theatre - but free speech does not come with indemnity: You are responsible for the consequences of your actions, including your speech. If other people in good faith reacts to your (in bad faith) shouting and get hurt, you are liable. If the theatre owner looses revenue from your shouting, you are liable.

3690836,comment,3690440,3690440,10,0,jonnathanson,,,"The problem with this article is that Rao keeps his key criteria, ""technical"" and ""financial,"" pretty loosely defined and conveniently flexible. Steve Jobs, for instance, gets a pass as ""technical"" under Rao's framework. While there's no question that Jobs had a profound understanding of technology, he couldn't have built Apple's first products by himself. Or, arguably, with the help of any old technical co-founder. In Steve Wozniak, he had no less than a once-in-a-generation technical genius at his side. Jobs had unparalleled technical vision, but he was not ""technical"" in the way that, say, Bill Gates was ""technical."" And yet, jobs was a tremendously effective CEO.<p>Furthermore, Rao's assertion that Jobs lacked ""people skills"" is demonstrably false. It's true that Jobs was an unrelenting perfectionist, an introvert, at times a genuine asshole, and probably narcissistic. But to say he lacked ""people skills"" is to ignore his profound understanding of how to communicate with people. How to inspire people, be they co-founders, employees, or customers. How to move people. These skills had to be quite strong, indeed, in order to overcome the barriers his difficult personality erected around him. When we speak of ""people skills,"" we really need to define what we're talking about. If we're simply talking about being an affable guy, then no, most CEOs probably don't pass the test. But if we're talking about the ability to understand, speak to, lead, organize, and often downright manipulate people, then yes, ""people skills"" are pretty crucial.",1331489191

3690830,comment,3690481,3690481,47,0,nirvana,,,"Its kinda amazing but this article contains the primary thesis-es of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.  This brings up some  important questions that I think its worth pondering.<p>Namely, that government creates crimes to control people, (""There is no way to rule an honest man. The only power government has is over criminals. Thus we create more and more laws until every man is a criminal."")<p>...and that this control relies on people accepting the easier way out, rather than standing up for their rights. (In Atlas, the alternatives offered the strikers were always easier than striking.)<p>At the end of the day, the question they both pose is this:  If some action really is immoral, is it not immoral for you to support it?  If the war on drugs is immoral, is it not immoral for you to pay for it?  If you're going to pay your taxes (a practical choice to be sure, even if you feel its immoral) why not match them by supporting organizations working to reform or eliminate the immoral actions those taxes fund? (e.g.: anti-drug war orgs, or a org that underwrites defense attorneys for people charged with drug crimes who want to fight them with a jury trial.)<p>If you're on a jury, are you going to listen when the judge tells you that you have to convict if you conclude that the person charged did in fact have drugs on them?  Or are you going to judge the law (one purpose of the jury) as well as the facts, and stand proud and hang the jury if you're unable to convince them the drug war is immoral?  Are you willing to lie on the jury questionnaire in order to get on the jury in the first place (since the questionnaire is designed to weed out people who will be immune to the jury tampering judges regularly engage in with their instructions.)<p>Or do you recognize this as immoral, but still think that the ""justice"" system itself <i>IS</i> moral because... its the government?<p>These are all rhetorical questions. I'm sure my position is obvious by the questions I'm asking, but I'm not looking to debate here, I'm just providing a perspective.  And my amusement that the NYT would write a story with such parallels to Atlas Shrugged.<p>One final parallel is that in Atlas, the system continues to deteriorate, even when most people know its wrong, because most people fool themselves into thinking that injustice is justice. (or are anti-mind, have adopted a philosophy that is against reason.)<p>So a final question- does an immoral law have any power?  Or is it null and void simply because its immoral? (In Maybury v. Madison the supreme court ruled that unconstitutional laws are invalid the day they are signed, no need for supreme court review to invalidate them... yet we had to have a constitutional amendment to create prohibition, but we never had one for the war on drugs...)<p>If a cop pulls over a driver and then searches his car and finds drugs, and you believe the drug laws are immoral, are you willing to admit that the cop is a criminal? (Or is ""just doing your job"" an excuse that gets him off the hook?)<p>If morality is objective, and the ""law"" he's enforcing is immoral, then the cop is the criminal in this hypothesis.  If morality is subjective, then the cop somehow is made moral when doing this, because law somehow conveys morality on otherwise immoral acts.  (Again all rhetorical.  I'm going to log out now and enjoy my Sunday.)",1331489050

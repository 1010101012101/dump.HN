Suboxone includes an opiate antagonist for the sole purpose of trying to keep people from injecting it. Injecting suboxone will send you into very unpleasant withdrawals immediately (I imagine there is some way to overcome that, though).<p>I used Suboxone to wean myself from physical dependence to opiates after years of pain management. I agree that the article glosses over how bad opiate physical withdrawals are, and my experience didn't include the emotional withdrawals.  My understanding is that suboxone withdrawals are much longer, due to its long half-life, but not as intense as heroin's.

Disqus and Livefyre are what most people use, but they have a ton of room for improvement. Some might say that they are doing really well, which would be true; however, there is hardly any competition, so anything Disqus and Livefyre do will be perceived as well, or simply, good enough.<p>I've been working on a way to redo commenting in my spare time, and I would like for it to become a thing. My idea consists of synced comments, an RSS like feed, a one column design (no threaded comments!) with expanding and minimizing replies, and a currency connected with real money that people can use to tip one another. I know it sounds far fetched, and it is, but I truly believe that commenting should be given saliency if writing and publishing online is going to move forward.<p>The next step is making my designs and ideas into a reality, however, I don't know how to code. I'm seeking someone who does, and in the meantime, I am teaching myself how to get starting with programming. The thing is, I could spend the next 1-2 years of my life learning how to code what I want to do when there is someone out there who knows how to do it already.<p>I suppose this comment is also to raise awareness for what I want to do for the future of commenting online.

Their mapping app is worse than Apple from a UX perspective. Granted the data is better, but Apple are improving very quickly in this concern. The Gmail app isn't even the best Gmail app on the platform, and their anti-user stance (getting rid of ActiveSync, not supporting push on other devices) is the only reason Mail isn't particularly great with Gmail. Conversely AS/Exchange, Hotmail/Outlook, Yahoo! and iCloud mail all work really well with Mail. The Google app itself is riddled with bugs that made the last update practically unusable and Now useless. The other apps barring Chrome, which does have issues but are out of Googles control, seem to be abandonware.

Sheryl Sandberg has a particular thesis and cherry picked some numbers from some study to support her assertion. He mocked this by cherry picking another. I'm pretty sure he doesn't particularly know (or care) if right-handed people are more successful in their careers.<p>This may be fair or it may be unfair criticism, but the fact that Sandberg threw a whole bunch of references in doesn't automatically mean her assertions are supported by science.<p>>if you ever find yourself arguing that someone's references are likely wrong because they are in the humanities... well I just want to punch you in the face really..<p>Your reading comprehension is suspect.

We work nights and weekends.<p>April 2009, I quit full time, start working 20 hours a week, and work on the startup 40-50 hours/week<p>2009-2011, continue working on startup full time, with occasional part-time contracting (less than 40 hrs/mo).<p>March 2011, my cofounder quits, I give up soon afterwards. We had zero revenue, zero traction, and no plan.<p>I screw around with a couple of ideas, and try to understand how we wasted the last 3 years.<p>I contract some more, realize I can't go back to big corporate life, and start another startup. This time I decide I'll do something ""easy"", with a clear path to revenue. We're going to charge people early. First line of code gets written in September 2011. We have beta users in December 2011. We turn on payments in April 2012. We sign up 14 paying customers in the first month.<p>We grow steadily, and raise $1.5M in December 2012. There are now weeks that where we add more customers than we did in the first few months. We'd be profitable if we stopped hiring.<p>It's been incredibly difficult, stressful and tiring. You need tenacity, but not too much, as my three-year wander in the desert showed. You need to not give up in your goal to be successful, but be able to give up on individual strategies.<p>You need people to support you, and you need to repay their support. My then girlfriend, now wife nearly left me several times because early on I didn't know how to handle the stress, and I didn't know how to unplug and have a nice night to repay her for putting up with my stress and inattention for the rest of the week. I don't think I could be successful without her.<p>My complete failure on the first startup was caused by not having a clear plan for how the startup was going to succeed. We should have done a better job identifying who the customer is, how we were going to charge them, and how we were going to reach them. Additionally, the first startup had large amounts of technical risk. (It was using some advanced machine learning, when neither of us started knowing machine learning).<p>I'd call myself a machine learning expert now, but that definitely wasn't the case when I started. There's a saying, ""in machine learning, you learn, and the computer doesn't"".<p>The other major failure was that we didn't evaluate our progress, in terms of business metrics. Each month the product got better, and we understood the algorithms more, but no progress was made on traction of any kind, or customer development. You should read Lean Startup before you write a single line of code in your startup. We should have given up after 3 months, or even a year of no progress. Instead we wasted 3.<p>Unless you're curing cancer, all startups have market risk. For first time entrepreneurs, I'd recommend against things that have both market risk and technical risk. And if you have technical risk, you'd better be an expert at it, before you start.",1368424974

Some other reasons:<p>+ The character of work and the workforce changed markedly in America over the years, from an economy where a man employed by BigCo could reasonably be assumed to work for BigCo until the day he died, to an economy where men and women work, labor force participation is often interrupted, and stints exceeding 3 to 5 years at a company are unusual enough to be remarked upon, to say nothing of 40+ years.<p>+ Defined-benefits pensions come bundled with a few other expectations, such as lifetime employment and tenure, which are sort of on the outs at US companies.<p>+ Defined-benefits pensions are highly correlated to workplaces which are toxic to work in, because you'll frequently find yourself surrounded by clockpunching deadwood whose sole goal in working is not doing anything to upset their chances of making pension.  If you've worked in government or a union shop, you know what I mean.  If you haven't, try doing software development for a week in a union shop, then evaluate whether receiving a pension is sufficient to have yourself sentenced to doing that for 40 years.",1368424935

The day job isn&#x27;t always fun or challenging, so I find other things to do like search and rescue and musical groups. Also tried my hand at consulting around 2000-2001, failed; tried another startup based on a GPS logger concept that never got off the ground. Would like to contribute to open source, but the aforementioned extra-curricular activities get in the way. Run my own email/web for personal stuff at hardcorehackers.com; can be reached at the usual (RFC) addresses there.<p>I despise Apple fanboys and Microsoft shills, but I&#x27;m getting better (mostly by laughing at the former and ignoring the latter).<p>I currently write software in C++, but don&#x27;t hold that against me, it&#x27;s mostly out of necessity (the day job). I&#x27;m willing to pick up just about anything, as long as it&#x27;s not proprietary, and I&#x27;ve dabbled in everything from LISP to FORTRAN, C, Python, Perl, Tcl/Tk, Java, R, etc, etc. My preferred development environment is Debian Linux running builds/interpreters from Emacs (the last editor on the last OS).",1331232487,1451065877

6196308,comment,6195616,6196177,2,0,phamilton,,,"app/concerns is a perfect example of the problem I&#x27;m trying to communicate. If I want to extract code out into a concern, everyone is perfectly ok with it because Rails has &quot;blessed&quot; the concern pattern by providing a parent object to inherit from and a directory where concerns should be placed. As soon as Rails weighs in with an opinion, everyone is onboard.<p>I think the message I would like to see communicated is that we as developers are free to create app/foo if we feel like foo is a good idea. Technically there&#x27;s nothing stopping it. Culturally, it&#x27;s almost unheard of.<p>I brought up lib/ because structurally it is a free for all. Nobody looks twice if I create lib/foo and add some code there. The problem is that I don&#x27;t want to put app specific code into lib. I&#x27;m not sure if app/lib is a good idea, but I feel like it would communicate the idea that it is OK to write app specific code that doesn&#x27;t fit into anything Rails has approved.<p>Anyway, I realize my concern is very much a culture issue. That culture has its pros and cons, and if we didn&#x27;t have the strong opinion to stick to MVC, we would probably end up with a ton of spaghetti code in app/lib. I just wish we could strike the right balance.",1376254732

6196294,comment,6195414,6195962,15,0,derefr,,,"HTML and CSS are the way they are because they, together, are markup for <i>documents</i>--and documents on the web are of indefinite shape. You can resize your browser window, or change your text-zoom, or insert/remove content in the DOM, and things have to <i>reflow</i>. Most importantly, this means that boxes containing reflowed text will get <i>longer</i> or <i>shorter</i>, and then push other boxes on the page up or down.<p>Because of this, it really makes no sense, in the context of an HTML document, to center something vertically--it&#x27;d just end up at some arbitrary position on top of some paragraph in the middle of the page&#x27;s content, found after N/2 screens of scrolling. This is what separates an HTML document from, say, a PDF: PDF pages <i>don&#x27;t</i> reflow, each one has a fixed height, so there <i>is</i> such thing as the &quot;center&quot; of a page on a PDF.<p>If the web were like PDFs, sure, it&#x27;d be easy to render it all using WebGL. But try imagining, now, writing an interactive text-layout-and-reflow engine in Javascript, to render web documents onto a WebGL canvas. How would you specify the constraints for that engine to follow? Some sort of declarative markup language based on a box model with paddings, borders, and margins, perhaps?<p>---<p>Now, on the other hand, web <i>applications</i> tend not to care so much about the shape of any &quot;document&quot;--what they&#x27;re interested in is the shape of the <i>viewport</i>. That has completely different semantics, and <i>can</i> be done easily in WebGL (&quot;viewport&quot; being a jargon term in GL.)<p><i>But...</i> web applications tend to embed, and rely upon, the reflow semantics of web <i>documents</i> surprisingly often. As soon as you want to include any controls with user-contributed content, you need that rich-text layout engine, and you can&#x27;t just pre-render it all to a canvas to bring it in, since users will want to copy and paste text from it...",1376254493

Maybe keep parts of HTML, and ditch CSS entirely in favour of something better, and use a JS lib to render it all on GLES hardware, the same in every browser</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure I follow you when you say &quot;keep parts of HTML&quot;. Are you suggesting that we should have a canvas element that spans the entire region of the page, store the actual markup of the page hidden somewhere on the page, and then parse and render that markup to the canvas element using JS+WebGl+<some CSS alternative>? Or are you saying that the browser should simply give up on rendering HTML markup, and give it over to your JS App which will render it itself using WebGL?<p>> <i>We now have many competing programming languages, competing frameworks, and so on, with a few mainstream ones and improvements/replacements all the time.

For bounce rate to drop you&#x27;d expect pages per visit to rise... unless there&#x27;s also a new event being fired.<p>My guess (as suggested by some commenters here before me) is that they shipped some type of event which fires for a fraction of visitors - scrolling a certain distance down the page perhaps.<p>If this event fires, the visit won&#x27;t (by default) count as a bounce. it will also effect time-on-site. Time on site is normally zero <i>unless</i> you visit another page or fire an event. In this case it&#x27;s determined by the time of the last page view or event that google registers. If they did ship an &quot;on 400px scroll&quot; event (for instance) then for each visitor for whom the event fires for, the &quot;time on site&quot; will be registered as the time of the event.<p>For my money, I think that bounce rates for content-driven sites <i>should</i> actually be set by a threshold time-on-site. Most visitors don&#x27;t read more than one page so it&#x27;s a very weak indicator of a &quot;bounce&quot;. Someone could read for 10 minutes and still count as a bounce which isn&#x27;t a fair appraisal of a very successful article.

At minimum stay in school as long as you possibly can.<p>* Take a year off before you decide to be a corporate employee or start a corporation of yours. Go see world. There has never been time like these to experience literally 100s of cultures that has evolved during past 1000s of years. If you postpone this to later age, most likely it&#x27;s not going to happen because you will have job with limited vacation or partner who has different preferences or kids who can&#x27;t travel safely to wild places. You are living Marco Polo&#x27;s dream. Don&#x27;t waste it.<p>* If and when you decide to seek employment, give money the least priority. A lot of young people are fixated on money in initial years either because they want to feel safe or want to prove themselves. This puts them on path to become corporate slaves that you see all around you and get disgusted. A lot of non-profits, pure science/art organizations and academic jobs has higher possibility to unlock your potential and give you enjoyment and satisfaction than initially higher paying jobs in big corporations and likes of wall street.<p>* When you are young (which I mean by less than 30 years old), involve in as many physical activities as possible. Mountaineering, rock climbing, kayaking, hiking, backpacking, swimming, marathons... Pick an activity, set a yearly goal and train for it. For example, swim a mile in open ocean or run a marathon or climb a 14000 footer or do your first 5.10 rock climb. Subscribe to local groups that does these so you have motivation.  All these are going to get much harder to pick up as you age. If you had started training for at younger age, you would continue to enjoy it in your 40s, 50s and sometime even in 60s. There is absolutely nothing more important than to be physically fit in your old age and you likely won&#x27;t get there unless you are active through your life.<p>* Make <i>physical</i> things! Have something non-trivial to show for each year that you <i>made</i> by your own hands. This would require to learn electronics, carpentry, machine tools, automobile engineering, plumbing, sewing, cooking and so on. Pick one of these skills, enroll in to real course at community/professional colleges and set a target to make something. These are skills takes years to perfect and unless you start at early age, chances are that you are not going to master it.<p>* Don&#x27;t rush to get married. A lot of times you will find a person who you think is perfect for you. You might even have anxiety to lose her/him. Take as much time as you possibly can without getting married. This is essentially to get to know person and them to know you. Once you get married, life is very different. You will take less risk and you will have far less time for anything else and your choices will be governed by mutual agreements instead of your own will. It&#x27;s not a waste of time but it&#x27;s different. If one you or both decides you have children, your life will change even more dramatically again. With even less risk taking, even less hard core exploration and even less time for anything else. Having children is rewarding but while you are young, do things and invest your time in things you can&#x27;t do later.",1376254043

First of all, I didn&#x27;t think it was necessary to call this &#x27;crackpottery&#x27;. Coming entirely from a scientific perspective one could write this off as completely philosophical and almost non-sensical. I would like to say that I&#x27;ve definitely gained some new insights or nearly a moment of eureka from reading certain words of the article.<p>Of course, I can&#x27;t describe exactly what is it that I&#x27;ve felt. But I can sort of provide the environment into which I&#x27;ve felt that feeling to try to find that common denominator which may exist in all of us.<p>I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Buddism, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a Buddist but I definitely try to take elements from Buddism that I concur with to better define my own experience with the world. Buddism has a notion which is identically described by the author - observation of the world without egos. Buddism suggests that being able to achieve this allows inner zen. I&#x27;m here not to advocate nor prove anything related to Buddism, I just want to use it for a setup leading to where I am at.<p>Through schooling an education, one thing we&#x27;ve learned is to be objective, and unbiased. This means innocent until proven guilty; do not accept any claims without facts; discounting scientific discoveries without proofs etc. That is, we come to be capable of being objective with things that do not &#x27;directly&#x27; connect with our consciousness. Now, entering the consciousness, can we still be objective? Can we observe our own failures just like how we observe the failures of others without emotional attachment? Can we connect to what others say to comfort us when we experience a rejection, a breakup? Can we understand that the past cannot be adjusted and therefore NEVER experience the feeling of regret and ONLY gain experience of what could be done better next time if the same were to happen? In general, can we completely deattach ourselves from our emotions and just observe the entities, whether it be you, him, or I, it&#x27;s all the same.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for others, but for a brief moment while reading the article, I&#x27;ve felt a weird out-of-place sensation where I&#x27;m just a being, and I am not I.

If we can engineer and then print a fully functional cell, one which perhaps performs a function radically different than found in any natural organism, then what we&#x27;re doing is no longer synthetic biology -- it&#x27;s nanotechnology. In this case, we&#x27;re building nanomachines, not cells.<p>Synthetic biology&#x27;s appeal is that it leverages nature to do all the heavy lifting -- we don&#x27;t have to engineer functions from the ground up, but only find similar designs in nature and then tweak them for our purposes. Furthermore, in synbio, we don&#x27;t actually have to <i>build</i> anything, but only design it. We let nature -- which can assemble cells extremely efficiently, through a process it has been refining for the last four billion years or so -- build our systems for us, once we&#x27;ve translated them into the language of genes. If we have the ability to build our own nanomachines from the ground up (understanding, of course, that the cell is simply a specialized nanomachine built by nature), there&#x27;s no need to constrain ourselves to the limitations inherent to nature&#x27;s design. At that point, there&#x27;s no reason not to divorce ourselves from the &quot;biology&quot; part of &quot;synthetic biology.&quot;",1376251730

I buy e-books irregularly, only when I need one, or interested in particular one and etc. I don&#x27;t buy just for the sake of buying another one. Also, if there is a sale on something, you can buy it to read in the future, just because there is a good deal. So I don&#x27;t think constant buying rate for e-books which is equal to the rate of reading is a good general assumption.",1376251404

Even if you can add a new library to your project in two days, that work most certainly will be to tie the new library to the existing libraries that you have been building upon from the start (the iOS SDK, in this instance), and thus that work would theoretically still not be exempt.<p>Sounds like a complicated mess.",1376251346

Are there things I wish it did not spend money on, and other things I wish it spent more on?  Absolutely.  Is it possible that, if the government spent money on exactly what you or I thought was ideal, it would be raising fewer tax revenues and spending a lot less?  Sure.<p>So what should we spend our money on?  This is a policy question, and fortunately one which (however indirectly) we each have a say and a stake in.  That is also what makes answering it a very messy process.<p>But answering it <i>presupposes</i> the principle that taxation by democratic government is legitimate.

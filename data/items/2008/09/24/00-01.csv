Has nothing to do with techies.<p>Corporations keep using the same tech until the incentive to switch overcomes the considerable cost. Vista just hasn't given enough incentive yet. XP had a similar problem, though not as bad because the OS (especially once driver issues were ironed out) offered more relative to the previous one.",1222217881
313021,comment,312429,312562,0,0,netcan,,,"An excellent example.<p>It's interesting that for years 'industry magazines' have produced glossy dungheaps to sell ads on. They can do this because advertisers want to believe that there is a publication that reaches 70% of all HR people in the tech industry or 45% of all OH&S people in the mining industry. In some cases there is such a paper. In many there just isn't. In the latter, the ads are carried by these idiot mags.<p>Now there's a way. Create your own. If you can.",1222217652

The difference between the right algorithm and the wrong one here is whether or not items that have already been randomly swapped can be swapped again. Simply performing n random selections on the list is wrong, and the easiest way to see why it doesn't work is harder math than you probably want to ask people for.\nMeanwhile, proving the other answer correct does require an inductive argument (pretty similar to the one that a selection sort works).<p>If your intuition led you to the right answer, that's cool, but for those who guess wrong, it sucks for them. The question doesn't do a good job of distinguishing between people who are smart and people who aren't because both the right and wrong answers seem pretty right because they're both stochastic. Unfortunately, only one is truly random.",1222214583

I really think this is the wrong approach, there is so much more to learn and explore than stupid pixels on a screen.<p>When we were young my parents had the attitude that it's very important to get a ""feel for the earth"", in a very literal way. That's why we spend as much time outside as possible. One of the few things I remember about primary school: I was the only one who knew potatoes grow below ground.

Somehow when times were good and everybody and their uncle could get a loan everybody loved Goldman Sachs CEO. But now, when it is pay off time people just hate the banks.

Sure, and if they told you to eat shit, you would eat shit, right?<p>Socialism is the love of blaming somone for your own failures. Free people not only make decisions, but also take responsibility for them. People who don't, should live for some time in a country where 'Dear Leader' will decide for them how they should live their lives because there is no difference to them anyway.<p>I'm tired of this BS.

Though plenty of research demonstrates that even competent adults are incapable of avoiding being influenced by good advertising in ways that may very well be against their own interests.<p>But when targeting children, it takes very little before your slight manipulation gets treated as if it was fact by young children. That it isn't ""asserting something as fact"" by adult standards is meaningless when discussing advertising that is targeting children.<p>And as a parent: Short of locking my child in the house with no access to any media, there is <i>no</i> way I can prevent my son from being exposed to advertising that he (at 4 years old) is in no way prepared to objectively assess the fact content of.",1369040203

I'd see it as an iterative process, whereby a set of backers post a problem, with or without a cost estimate. The solver puts forward a proposal with estimated costs and each backer chooses whether they want to accept that proposal. The process then iterates until a tipping point is reached in the funding.<p>Good idea to see it as an addendum to an existing service rather than a service in its own right.  Or an amalgam might work, whereby the ""kickstarter for problems"" is a separate service, but on reaching the tipping point the project morphs into a regular kickstarter project, that has already reach its tipping point.  This would require each backer to also have a kickstarter account (if not the kickstarter project would come up below its tipping point), but it would save a minimum viable product from the complexities of having to handle money.",1369039403

If you get people to actually buy and take a decent (calorie wise) serving and eat it slowly, it works great. But it's all too easy to eat a 800kcal-1000kcal bag of nuts without thinking about it.<p>I think a huge part of the problem in <i>general</i> is large packs of food. Ready-made sandwiches in packs with 800-900kcal, for example, or nuts or high-calorie drinks sold in quantities that ought to be anywhere from 2-3 to 10+ servings. Ready-meals that comes only in massive portions that might work ok if you're buying it to split 2 or 3 way, but that are often horribly oversized if you eat alone.<p>It's all great and economical when you're buying stuff to put in the cupboard <i>and</i> have the willpower to resist eating larger quantities, but clearly we can see that people don't. And unfortunately there's little reason for most manufacturers or supermarkets to offer smaller alternatives, as we're too easily seduced into buying the larger packs.<p>Personally I found my soda intake dropped substantially after I started buying my weekend soda ""allowance"" in 250ml bottles instead of 0.5l or 1.5l bottles, for example.

5736575,comment,5733290,5735993,1,0,reedlaw,,,"Regarding credit card security (or lack thereof)--protection lies mainly in the massive fraud prevention efforts of the credit card companies (hence the large fees). It gives more protection to consumers than merchants (it's easy to request chargebacks). Bitcoin offers an alternative security model, known as caveat emptor. There's no way to reverse a transaction. All consumer protection devices, such as escrow, are outside the scope of the protocol. So bitcoin by itself may or not be an acceptable means of payment, depending on the use case.<p>I understand the risk of a single party attacker who controls more than half the network. But at this point, what kind of attacker can muster up that much computing power? Only a nation-state, billionaire, or large corporation could conceivably do so. And it's daily growing beyond their reach. Not only that, but their motive must be not just to make gains. They would have to want to destroy the bitcoin economy. Interestingly, the bitcoin economy has already survived a 24-block split without major calamity[1].<p>I had a look at the papers you linked to. The Canetti paper certainly seems more rigorous and formal. But the Danish Beet Auction paper actually doesn't seem too far from the Bitcoin whitepaper.

5736532,comment,5736360,5736360,5,0,PakG1,,,"For such simple rules, Go is an amazingly complex game.  In the years that I've played, I've never gotten to an amateur dan level, and of course have never been close to a professional level.  I think the highest I've ever achieved was a 4kyu on www.gokgs.com, though I haven't gone back for a while.<p>As I've played, I've noticed that my mentality on how to play the game would change.  It's much like how for a kids hockey match, everyone will crowd around the puck in one big clump all over the ice, but as they mature, they'll learn passing, strategy, breakout plays, defensive schemes, etc.<p>My evolution of gameplay went something like this:<p>1.  Play wherever the other person is playing.  Conquer the board one section at a time by winning one battle at a time.<p>2.  Spread out to try to cover more of the board at the same time.  Depend on coverage to win, with skirmishes here and there as borders clash.<p>3.  Battles on one side of the board influence and impact battles on the other side of the board.  Strategy still hinges on staking territory, but individual skirmishes depend on brute force calculations to choose the correct path of stone layout to win each skirmish.<p>4.  The entire board is contested, whether territory has been staked or not.  Any location on the board can become a point of attack.  Identify critical points that would make the other player's defenses collapse.  Rip them apart from the inside out and own the whole board.  At this point, it's no longer trench warfare along large borders.  It becomes more like sending in special forces into the heart of enemy territory to blow up seemingly secure fortifications.  Brute force calculations into the future are no longer always possible due to the complexity of the branch prediction, so rely more on intuition and experience if necessary.<p>Of course, I am easily humbled whenever I play an amateur hobbyist who is actually truly good (usually from South Korea).  They are able to execute my #4 style of play at a level far higher than anything I can imagine.  It is mindblowing to see them slice up my defenses like hot butter, while I can do nothing to even remotely damage their defenses, even if they are handicapped at the beginning of the game.<p>It makes me have a lot of respect for the game when I can have exciting complex games when playing with people at my own level, but still be decimated by others who are still only amateurs themselves.  The game can be fun at any level of play, which I think some games aren't able to do.<p>I cannot even imagine what it would be like to play against actual professionals.  I imagine it would be like a Diamond level Starcraft 2 player going up against MC or MVP (ironic that both the top Go players and Starcraft 2 players are from South Korea?).<p>Sadly, though the game was invented in China, I do not find many Chinese people who are interested in this game, despite the article's claims (I currently live in China today).  I wonder why that is.  Maybe I'm just not meeting enough people.",1369038121

It's ""easy"" to fit in a snack between small meals, but after lunch I'm totally sick of food, and it's hard for me to even meet my macro nutrient goals (I lift weights; my protein intake is high). Often I have to force myself to take in a second meal to meet my calorie needs (edit: because I simply often don't <i>want</i> to eat again before the end of my eating window, around 8pm, after my massive lunch at noon).<p>On the opposite end, I see very few people around me that eat ""only"" two meals. My co-workers for example, might very well only sit down for a meal twice, but they snack constantly. And their ""snacks"" are often substantially higher calorie than their main meals. When I <i>did</i> try to diet with many small healthy meals, it was a nightmare - I was constantly hungry and constantly craving food.<p>When I do intermittent fasting, I have hunger pangs in the mornings 2-3 days, and then I stop being hungry in the mornings.",1369037891

I could maybe understand a rule that said ""no bras"" if they thought that a bra could be used to smuggled something somehow, but forcing all women visiting to wear bras seems odd. Are they afraid of a prison riot over a bra-less woman?<p>4) Are there really rules against him distributing information to the outside world via friends or his lawyer? What is the point of such rules? For some stupid edge-case of suppressing mafia bosses from operating from prison? Are they trying to stop criticism of the jail conditions from reaching the outside (i.e. anti-whistle-blower)?<p>5) If Weev really <i>did</i> break some sort of prison rules, then why will they not confirm <i>why</i> he was put in administrative detention? He's obviously there for a reason, why will they not disclose it? Makes it come across like they feel that disclosing the reason would look worse than just withholding it and waiting for all this to blow over.<p>6) Why are they not giving him gluten-free meals if that's 'what the doctor ordered?'

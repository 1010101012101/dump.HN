4036076,comment,4031608,4032289,2,0,Aethaeryn,,,"I haven't had any issues with the multimonitors besides:<p>- The Fedora defaults for background image stretches a 1920x1080 picture across what is effectively 3840x1080 pixels. There doesn't appear to be an elegant way to set a background image for a multimonitor setup, so I just paste together two different 1920x1080 pictures to form a 3840x1080 picture when I need to set something as my background image.<p>- The panel defaults to being stretched across both screens so I needed to adjust its size. Very minor annoyance that this doesn't work by default.<p>-----<p>There's also a larger issue with fullscreen.<p>Fullscreen on most applications that try to launch fullscreen, especially games with SDL, appears to be broken. Apparently they see my displays as one large 3840x1080 monitor instead of two separate 1920x1080 monitors. They then throw some type of error about unsupported resolution and switch into windowed mode (or, rarely, they crash).<p>I set Ctrl+F11 as a custom hot key to force fullscreen, which seems to work on almost everything. So I launch things in windowed mode, drag the window to the monitor I want to use the application on, and then press Ctrl+F11 to make it take fullscreen on that monitor. If that for some reason doesn't work, I can maximize the screen and remove the Openbox window decoration.<p>VirtualBox is the one application I regularly use that seems to handle fullscreen okay without any effort on my part. RightCtrl+F makes the VM fullscreen on its current monitor without any issues and VirtualBox remembers this and has no issues launching into fullscreen, either. Thus, it's probably an issue with common libraries and not with LXDE itself.<p>GNOME 3 sometimes has problems similar to this, especially when games using SDL attempt to launch into fullscreen at the start. I prefer LXDE's workarounds to the ones I had to use in GNOME 3. I especially like LXDE+Openbox's ability to remove window decorations just by right clicking on the window title bar at the top and selecting the appropriate option.",1338268911

No offense to all the web-devs here but web programmers are not operating system programmers in the same way operating system programmers are not web programmers. Not to mention the hardware side of what it takes to make a phone (although they could outsource the hardware to another company similar to the way the Google Nexus program works).<p>Instead, in my humble-yet-broadly-assumptive opinion, the best R.O.I. for facebook would be to try and lobby for greater integration in the phones and mobile operating systems that already exist rather than try and reinvent the wheel on their own. I think they missed a major opportunity by not becoming integrated in the iPhone (losing out to twitter), but I don't think they entirely missed the boat there.

Its one of the places where gcc has really let me down, because if you get an ARM cross compiler its expecting anything and everything. The various flavors of C library are all bulky and nicely modularized but somehow less useful. And of course there are things in there which assume an OS (stdio for example) or at least a model that the code adheres to) but embedded systems are sometimes not that easily adapted.<p>And there are libraries provided by the manufacturers which have copyright notices in them about how this code can only be compiled to run on their (the manufacturer's) brand of ARM and when I look at the code I keep thinking ""Hmm, I bet if I dug up the code I wrote for SunOS 4.0 when I was but a wee kernel hacker to make libc work with shared libraries, that a lot of it would be eerily familiar :-)<p>So what it boils down to are that there are 'things' and the useful things are 'memory abstraction (bcopy/memcpy etc)' string abstractions 'str<i>' and character abstractions 'is</i>' and then io abstractions (open/close/read/write/seek/rewind) and then thread abstractions (fork/sleep/wake/longjmp/yield) and suddenly your USLS is basically an OS API (or it could be) and you're back to square zero.<p>So rather than a universal library, why not universal VIM code? VIM is already syntax aware based on your language you could add the ability to insert the appropriate code to do what you wanted to do while you were editing. So if you had a variable and you typed if a:upcase == b:upcase it would syntactically awarely conver a:upcase to 'strtoupper(a)' or u""$a"" or a->upper() or what ever the language you were writing in needed.

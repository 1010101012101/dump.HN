10002779,comment,9994246,9997251,0,0,pluma,,,"> Rails, Chef, Puppet, Homebrew, Cocoapods, Vagrant, Jekyll...<p>Most of these are primarily tools that can be used without being a Ruby programmer (even if treating the DSLs as black magic is worrisome). Rails is popular but despite how vocal its users tend to be it&#x27;s not as widely used as you may think it is. Ruby is disproportionately widely recognized considering its actual &quot;market share&quot; (just like e.g. Haskell).<p>> replace Ruby with any programming language and the statement it&#x27;s true. human beings just work this way.<p>Different programming language communities are different. I&#x27;ve met plenty of dispassionate PHP, C#, Java and JS programmers. I&#x27;ve yet to meet a Ruby programmer who doesn&#x27;t hold the opinion that Ruby is the best thing since sliced Jesus, every language should always be replaced with Ruby and that Ruby is pretty damn close to perfect. I haven&#x27;t met any dispassionate Python programmers either, but they tend to be far more nuanced about their opinion of Python.<p>Heck, the Ruby community came up with Haml so it could pretend to write Ruby when writing HTML, Sass (proper Sass, not the new-fangled more conservative SCSS) so it could pretend to write Ruby when writing CSS and CoffeeScript so it could pretend to write Ruby when writing JS. They even use Ruby for configuration files &quot;because DSLs are easier&quot; (unless you don&#x27;t know Ruby).<p>Let&#x27;s also not forget that the reason Codes of Conduct for conferences (and even open source projects) had to become a thing (e.g. the brogrammer culture) primarily originated in the Ruby community (before it spread to others). And also the entire _whytheluckystiff and Zed Shaw dramas.<p>You can fish for equivalents to these things in other communities but the scale and ubiquity is simply exceptional in the Ruby community. Just like PHP is exceptional in how much bad PHP code there is, Ruby is exceptional in what its community is like.<p>> People think they have all the answers, when in reality the experience of each individual is unique.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think we disagree about this. That&#x27;s precisely what I&#x27;m saying: that Ruby programmers tend to love Ruby doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s always the right choice for teaching absolute beginners.",1438689389

</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    for x in xs:
        yield from f(x)
</code></pre>
(`unit` could also be defined as `yield x` but that wouldn&#x27;t make much of a difference)<p>The provided program returns a `list` of all solutions though, not any sort of iterator, generator or otherwise.<p>This is confirmed by the runtime being anything other than instantaneous, a lazy version would just print the repr of the lazy iterator (say `<generator object bind>`), not the actual result (unless the iterator defined an __repr__/__str__ but very very few do, and those that do have little to nothing to compute e.g. dict views)<p>Original program:<p><pre><code>    > time python3.4 test_list.py
    [(9567, 1085, 10652)]
    python3.4 test_list.py  6.43s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 6.480 total
</code></pre>
Converted to `yield from` and `yield`:<p><pre><code>    > time python3.4 test_yield.py
    <generator object bind at 0x1066ba7e0>
    python3.4 test_yield.py  0.04s user 0.01s system 84% cpu 0.062 total
</code></pre>
nb: this comment assumes Python 3 is being used given the print function, Python 2 doesn&#x27;t have `yield from` and you&#x27;d need `itertools.imap` as the builtin `map` is eager<p>nb2: on my machine, reifying the lazy version has roughly the same runtime as the eager version in CPython (2.7.10 and 3.4.3), in PyPy (2.6.0 ~ CPython 2.7.9) the reified lazy version (using chain.from_iterable) runs in half the time (~3s) as CPython and the eager version runs in 1/6ths the time (~1s)",1438689110

Even for students with considerable prior knowledge, strong guidance while learning is most often found to be equally effective as unguided approaches. Not only is unguided instruction normally less effective; there is also evidence that it may have negative results when student acquire misconceptions or incomplete or disorganized knowledge<p>So .. the big &quot;theory&quot; in education is that &quot;students learn better by teaching themselves&quot;.

10002688,comment,10002184,10002399,0,0,anon4,,,"> <i>balance</i><p>This is a funny word if you think about it. It&#x27;s the property where several forces on a point are in equilibrium. This definition generalises to very abstract situations, and especially to political ones. Several sides are all pulling (or pushing... the metaphor doesn&#x27;t really matter) in their own direction and where the final decision falls is where the powers are in equilibrium. It&#x27;s the point which is as dissatisfactory for every party as that party is powerless. Sometimes, that&#x27;s what you want.<p>Often, balance evokes the image of the halfway point. The balance between killing every Jewish baby and no Jewish baby is not killing half of all newborns. It&#x27;s also not killing exactly zero babies. If you want a balance between killing all Jewish babies and no Jewish babies, the neo-nazis all have a saying and you end up having to kill one of every hundred million or so babies. Which is unacceptable. This example was an extremist straw-man to illustrate the following point: You&#x27;re not looking for balance, you&#x27;re looking to maximise a utility function.<p>The utility function may be maximised by looking for balance between forces, in fact it often is, or we approach something close to the maximum by finding the balance. However, you mustn&#x27;t mistake the balance for the utility function. You&#x27;re not maximising balance. You&#x27;re looking for a solution to a problem. You want less javascript client frameworks? Ok. You still want some javascript client frameworks? Ok. Why.<p>Because you want to maximise the utility of javascript client frameworks (I assume). This utility might be different for different people, i.e. they may want to do different things with the frameworks, etc. But, I can agree with you that having a constant stream of new ones serves no utility, except the tautological one of &quot;let&#x27;s have as many frameworks as we can write&quot;.<p>Now we come back to balance. At some rate of new frameworks being made, we balance out the amount of work spent on maintenance of the old ones with the influx of new ideas that make our work and life easier and from time to time we completely overhaul and forget an old technology. Which, in turn, maximises our utility of these frameworks. It does look like balance <=> utility, but not quite. This is a balance in the context of a specific utility function. You&#x27;ve defined the utility function as &quot;I want X and Y with preference weights α and β&quot;, which looks very much like a linear programming[1] problem, the solution to which is... weighted balance.<p>Others would not agree to your utility function. They maybe don&#x27;t want new ideas so much. Now you&#x27;re balancing utility functions. But those people still agree that they want to &quot;find the balance&quot;. It&#x27;s just that their equilibrium is not your equilibrium.<p>So, please don&#x27;t just throw out &quot;there&#x27;s balance&quot; like that. Everyone can agree to balance and it&#x27;s at a different point for different people. It&#x27;s a word that causes... well, muddled thinking. If you can, avoid using it at all[2]. Get to the root of your problem as much as you can, then say what ails you. &quot;I like seeing new approaches tried, but it&#x27;s hard to keep up with the influx of largely samey ones that are constantly cropping up. I wish they would slow down.&quot; -- or something along these lines, I&#x27;m not saying this is what you specifically want.<p>Sorry for the long rant. I&#x27;ve had to listen to people wanting to balance a lot lately.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming</a> a type of math problem concerned with finding the point where the given variables all satisfy a set of constraints expressed as linear inequalities and a given function achieves a maximum.

Everyone had changed their tune once they hit growth in users and complexity. Why? Because being ideologically right is not as nice as being sure you&#x27;re writing code that works.<p>The fact is if you have a serious site there&#x27;s a good chance SOME specific feature will start looking appealing ( maybe array values, JSON , window functions, a pg extension...). These features are written because people use them, we aren&#x27;t all writing dead simple CRUD apps. Or you your ORM will interact with one slightly differently than the other. I don&#x27;t expect to convince any of you doubters, but the first time you get a bug in prod that slipped through the testing process but really could have been caught in dev, you&#x27;ll ask yourself why you weren&#x27;t using pg there too.<p>There&#x27;s no sane reason to complicate your life by running two databases unless you either have a dead simple app, or are one of the jabbering idealists I see on here.

The more you know about the job, the better integrated you can be with others, either as a manager yourself or working with managers. That 3-way diagram? Holds true at the developer level as well.<p>2. Management ain&#x27;t programming. When I learned to fly airplanes on instruments, the toughest thing was realizing that I had to rely on the gauges and fight my natural instincts. Likewise, if you&#x27;ve been a super-cool coder for many years, you&#x27;re going to have to give up those coding and architecture instincts and learn people management ones. I see far too many extremely smart people try building and managing systems of people just as if they were computers. Wrong answer.<p>3. Ambition is fine. Being a jerk is not. If you like managing, you need to realize that it&#x27;s always a gut check to make sure you&#x27;re doing the right thing, and you very well may end up in a position where it is better to leave your current company and go play somewhere else than it is to continue.

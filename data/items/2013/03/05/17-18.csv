Looks like it's on your roadmap but it's far, far more useful in tracking down actual perf issues in large codebases than any other tool in any developer tools toolbox because it's cross-cutting and bottlenecks tend to be a combination of factors and the frame-sizing lets you find what's on the critical path when it's on the critical path. I use it 10 times for every one use of all other perf profiling tools (I consider network/pageload to be a different set of problems).<p>I don't see it on the roadmap but the firefox console is SO terrible at printing objects. In most apps I work on I'm shipping around 2kB+ JSON objects and the current console is absolutely worthless for these.<p>Related, but I think there's room for improvement in object printing in general. I find myself not really caring about most fields in an object but I'd like a couple fields printed inline before expansion. I like that the firebug console prints a few fields with the option to expand objects but would like to have control over which fields those are. FWIW, my preferred pretty printer is node's.<p>I find CSS errors/warnings to be absolutely useless in both the firefox dev tools and opera's. Pretty much any modern site is using vendor prefixes and the result is hundreds or thousands of errors which makes the console fall over.<p>Due to the above, I've been taking the approach of trying dev tools out again every time Aurora updates and then going back to using firebug and chromium after 15 minutes or so. I completely missed the jsterm addon despite following you on a couple channels. It looks reasonable so I'll be giving it a go today.<p>When you're doing your network cascade panel, please set it up to load HAR files. You can get HARs from a variety of sources but there isn't (yet) a convenient way to view them locally.<p>For the debugger, I don't know of an equivalent of webkit's source view cmd+o / cmd+shift+o, which are extremely useful. The cmd+p filtering is decent but most of the time I do actually know what file and function I'm looking for. I also use the reformat button and break on caught/uncaught exceptions on a regular basis. Actually, now that I think about it, I use every single function except for the editing functionality on the chromium sources panel at least once a week.<p>For the style editor, the side list of stylesheets isn't mousewheel scrollable on my machine (I'm on Aurora).<p>I find dock right to be the most useful attached view for chrome tools. Screens (and particularly laptop screens) are wider than they are tall and dock right takes advantage of that.<p>Edit: For a larger feature, I would very much like the ability to edit code when the browser hits an exception and then continue execution using the new code. I've only seen this in smalltalk demos so I assume it's difficult but being able to flip a variable to tweak an if statement when stepping through the debugger saves the effort of getting back into the correct state from pageload.",1362505513

We're also explicitly not building a ""large"" feature (so it's very likely to get coded in a day or two) so the surface area for major showstopper bugs is minimized.<p>Often the feature will be thrown away or majorly refactored into something that is completely different.<p>In this case, full-bore 9x% coverage TDD is probably waste as the feature existed for a short period of time, the interface changed dramatically, or otherwise was proven invalid. High test coverage makes <i>major</i> interface refactors really expensive and you really don't need that level of quality for speculative features.<p>After you prove this feature is a ""thing"" you want to keep around (and you've nailed down the interface), then it's a perfect time to re-write it with a much higher degree of test coverage.",1362505286

Here's why.<p>It doesn't take two hours to write tests, because by and large, you're writing the same code you'd throw into the REPL, or performing the same actions (in code) that you would need to repeat over-and-over again in a browser to see if the feature works.

While we commonly speak about to the parameterized types without their type arguments, they aren't really ""types"" in the type theory sense while there are still type arguments to be supplied. That is, ""Maybe""'s kind is * -> * while Maybe a's kind is * even though a is a generic type.<p>When referring to something as a ""monadic value"" I was just trying to emphasize that the monad that contains a value is itself a value in the Haskell runtime system and that such a ""monadic value"" is separate from the value contained there within.<p>Finally, maybe this is a bad habit of mine, but I've always referred to values as instances since they inhabit types.<p>I disagree that the namespacing is only ever an issue for a complete beginner. The visual separation between a type expression and a value expression in Haskell can be pretty thin. It's not just about whether they are unambiguous but how much attention you have to pay to while you're skimming code. Honestly, I don't think there's much that can be done about it, but it's just the cherry on top for beginner and intermediate users. Especially ones who aren't using Haskell regularly.",1362504636

It's a nice little game theory problem. A single defector from the ""only work for money"" strategy probably benefits; the rookie journalist gets his foot in the door, gets the ""exposure"" and the industry connections, and so yields an advantage over his peers.<p>But once all his peers defect from the paid strategy, the whole thing comes crashing down. None of them achieve any advantage over any other. They just drive the median compensation down towards zero.<p>The claim that there's an abundance of high quality journalism is hogwash. There isn't.

In my opinion if you dont have any of these problems, you work in a unique place...<p>- Agile - Agile IMHO largely screws you in making sound technical decisions.  Its not necessarily because agile is flawed - its usually because business/management uses agile as an excuse to randomly take a hard left turn every other week making it much harder to make long term architectural choices that are beneficial.<p>- No agreed upon standards or unification amongst software professionals - The accountant in this situation has a set of standards and expectations that allow/force him or her to do things in a moderately set way.  This allows for the accountant to usually fend off management from pressuring things to be done in a shoddy or just get it done way.  On the other hand its much more difficult for software professionals to say ""we as a group do not condone writing shitty software"" (because ironically a large number of us do ... ""move fast, break things"" has done more good than bad from my perspective)<p>- Ageism - Also known as experience doesn't really matter.  Some will say thats because technology changes so much - but it actually doesn't.  Just because you've been grappling with software problems and design patterns in Java doesn't mean that when you switch over to Python that really anything changes.  Same shit, same problems, different words - but in all honesty we seem to be pretty bad at building on the experience of our elders because they are over the hill at 35... what could they possibly teach us.<p>For me it at times has been frustrating because coming out of school I really enjoyed the fun of designing systems and code that are sustainable, performant, etc etc but there seemingly is typically more reward for just throwing quality out the window in startups.

Instead, the author seeks to make the broader point that cutting corners in engineering is not a good idea <i>even in a startup</i>. While it can make startup engineers feel like they are moving quickly relative to the competition, the engineering debt incurred is non-negligible.<p>I strongly agree with this point, and don't buy the blanket rationale that speed trumps everything in a startup. Yes, speed is quite important when you are bringing something new to market; it lets you get your foot in the door and rapidly find the right fit for your product. But if you cut corners then your product will suffer, and you'll end up treating your customers poorly by it.<p>There's a fine balance to all these things, of course. We all have to find the right balance between keeping engineering standards high and heavy-handed structures.",1362504151
5325805,comment,5325491,5325491,14,0,jmduke,,,"I like to talk about TDD using a finance analogy.<p>One of the first concepts you learn in introductory finance is that, in a mature market (ie the stock market -- basically something with a bunch of people and a bunch of information) you have to be compensated for <i>risk</i>.  This is why a riskier stock -- like tech stocks or penny stocks -- can boast incredible amounts of risk but generally will give you higher returns over the aggregate than something like pork commodities or a CD.  When you choose to purchase a tech stock -- or any stock at all -- you're saying ""okay, I recognize that this is riskier, but I think I'm being fairly compensated for the risk, too.""<p>Choosing to eschew TDD is like purchasing stocks.  By definition, going through TDD is going to be a safe route, but it's rare that TDD (at least in my and my friends'/peers' experiences) is actually going to make you get from Point A to Point B any faster.  TDD isn't, by default, a superior or inferior approach to anything: it's a tradeoff -- do you want risk or do you want return?<p>Sometimes, you want to minimize risk, and that's probably smart.  Sometimes, you just want to produce an MVP -- and that's okay, too.",1362504149

This also means you probably need source map style support for LESS and SASS also.  Also to change HTML template files the server side needs to know how the page was constructed so it can find the correct partial / template to save changes to.  Which is probably really hard depending on how much state based conditional rendering there is in your templates, maybe the server side caches the last response and associated state to work around this.",1362504070

Mozilla can lead the way.<p>I am going to post it here for ease of reference:<p>1) I propose a simple mechanism to guarantee that a resource located at a certain URL is always the same. Similar to how we have <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a> blabla, and the user agent warns us if the server's certificate is not trusted, we should have httpc:// blabla to indicate constant resources. Sites all over the world can download resources from httpc:// urls and store hashes to them in various formats, and your user agent can trust one or more of these authorities. When downloading, it would compare the hashes against the ones downloaded from these authorities, and if there is even a small deviation, it would give you a warning just like <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a><p>This must be done by the user agent. Right now we do have ""cache control"" headers, but I am talking about the server making a promise to the world that a page is really truly static, and user agents having the ability to verify that. This is different from server-controlled caching.<p>I can see this being used in app stores for the web (curating apps and various versions of apps, like Apple does) and also for secure logins. I would like someone to make guarantees that my password is not being sent in the clear to the server that I am connected to. Right now, the web forces us to trust a remote server completely, when interacting with a website. For example, when I enter a password, I have no assurance that the server won't misuse it. (See <a href=""http://xkcd.com/792/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/792/</a>)<p>This simple change would make possible a variety of applications that we haven't even thought of, besides these two.<p>2) The second proposal is to have iframes that are on top of everything else in the containing window, no matter what. That would enable 3rd party logins (such as OAuth) do be done in the iframe, without worrying about clickjacking. The javascript inside the iframe should have a way of checking whether the iframe is of this type. At most one such iframe can be shown in any given window.<p>This would lead to much more pleasant interfaces, and once again, the user would receive the extra protection. Of course, this means that Flash and other plugins would have to play nice with this. We could implement this rather easily with a browser extension that causes a borderless window to appear (like Flash does) above the actual browser window.<p>Thoughts?",1362503758

5325731,comment,5325445,5325445,20,0,sisk,,,"Hey Paul. First off, thanks for reaching out to the community like this.<p>A few things:<p>Visualized event bindings. Would be awesome to have a visual indicator of event bindings right on the page. Color-coded bounding boxes drawn around elements with a label denoting the event type. Clicking on that box (or label in the case of an element with multiple bindings or nested elements with bindings) would direct you to the code that does the binding.<p>An aggregate repaint view. Chrome lets me view repaints but it clears after every one. If I have a method that is doing a lot of dom manipulation, I have to step through the code to view all of the repaints. Would be great to have the repaint bounding boxes drawn with a low opacity background so that I could see (and clear out) an aggregate view (with highly redrawn areas having higher opacity due to there being multiple layers).<p>An intelligent debugger that would automatically step over certain files (selectable per debugging session). I occasionally want to step into jQuery but less often than not. I know I can step over those methods but would be great if I could just keep stepping in without accidentally stepping into something when I don't want to.<p>I'll edit this as I think of more.<p>EDIT:<p>Breaking on navigation or on a particular request in order to manipulate headers. Breaking on the response from those requests for the same reason (plus manipulating the body).<p>The timeline and profiles sections in Chrome are under-utilized but infinitely useful. Anything close to those would be much appreciated.<p>Throw warnings for potentially orphaned event listeners. Granted, the number one offender recently introduced methods to address this (backbone's #stopListening) but it's still a easy mistake to make. This might bleed into too much hand-holding and open up a can of worms but just a thought.<p>Throw warnings for overloaded event listeners that fire a lot. Like the last suggestion, this may be heading in a direction you don't want to go in (educating the developer by means of the dev console) but, all too often, I find pages that overload, e.g., the scroll event. If there was some way to inform the developer of this potential problem, I think the web at large would greatly benefit.

5325672,comment,5323665,5325048,1,0,robomartin,,,"> When curiosity landed on Mars, Time Square was paying attention.<p>And then they forgot. Seriously. That's our reality today.<p>I'll use my oldest kid as an example of this.  He is a straight A (more like A+) student.  So are all of his immediate friends.  A perfect pack of nerds.  I love them all.  He is intensely interested in science.  He loves it.<p>Do you know how much of his inspiration comes from the space program or the robots on Mars?  Not much.  Every so often we'll go to JPL for ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" moments.  The problem is that these always seem like short hits of adrenaline rather than persistent boosts.<p>Where these kids get inspiration and constant drive at this point is at home and at school.  We make it a point to take them to local (Los Angeles) and distant (San Jose) robotics events and other science-related activities.  When he has a science project we dive right in.  I've been teaching him how to approach such projects as a real engineer, doing research, modeling, estimating, constructing prototypes, testing, etc.  We build and fly model airplanes and helicopters.  We build giant soap bubble machines.  We got rid of our dinning room table and built a (good looking) Lego FLL competition table right in the middle of our dinning room [1].<p>On top of that I am teaching him programming in various languages and generally exposing him to that world.<p>All of this takes time, dedication and, yes, some money.  Without effort at this level the decay time of exciting events such as the Mars rover drilling into a rock is probably measured in minutes, if not seconds.  These days kids have so many interesting and fun things competing for their attention that keeping them focused on what is really going to make a difference in their lives can be a full time job.  Not easy.<p>That's why I am skeptical about this whole idea of a mission to Mars having any lasting inspirational value. It'll be an ""Oh, wow! We did it!"" moment for sure.  Not certain that it will have mass value beyond a day or two, certainly not months later.  Yes, a few people will be inspired.  I think there are far cheaper ways to accomplish the same thing.<p>With regards to space colonization.  I'm a Star Trek baby.  Grew up watching the show.  Love the idea.  Also understand that it is as close to impossible as can be.  Unless we make an absolutely astounding discovery on Mars the likelihood of finding a habitable planet within a distance measured in human lifetimes is very low.  Mars might be the closest we can possibly consider for such an exercise.  Even then, it is nearly an impossible task.  Have you ever watched a show like Survivorman?  Not so easy to survive and thrive with limited resources here on Earth.  Exponentially more difficult on another planet.<p>This is why I think that developing and using a near-space spacecraft as I described would be worth it.  We would learn a lot from this.  It would be used to develop and test technology for far-space exploration.  It would probably create long term financial benefits from near-space activities.  And it could be a constant source of interesting activities for our short-attention span generation.<p>In another sense I am saying: Let's build a reusable no-reentry vehicle that can make regular trips to the Moon.  Let's operate it and learn from it for a few years.  Then, and only then, consider the idea of building a spacecraft that will take humans to far-space locations.  For all we know our near-space ship could, over time, evolve into the far-space ship we would require.  That would happen ""organically"", if you will, and over time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2006/06/fll-competition-table-building-plans.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2006/06/fll-competition-table...</a>",1362503143

I'd personally kill for a tool akin of Chrome's timeline, where to debug performance issues not related to javascript, like rendering e.g. things that trigger a complete screen redraw and whatnot. I'd really like to see this happen because at the moment if an app is super snappy on Chrome but slow on Firefox and javascript is not the culprit, I'm left basically to guess how to improve the performance.",1362502835

That essentially gives you a fixed target. Changes in a new release won't break your hack, because your hack doesn't apply to new releases anyway. It's still awful, but much less scary.",1362502826

The news requested by the global editor was commodity news; it wasn't exclusive content.<p>The problem with commodity news is not one of quality but of quantity. Much like any other commodity product, news is driven by volume. Unfortunately, demand has far outstripped the supply. In the absence of clear differentiators, organizations rely on SEO tactics, content marketing and social media tools as new distribution channels for news.<p>Most technology-oriented solutions, however, put a different tack to the problem. They approach it from the efficiency perspective. Acquiring news (or, reporting and writing news) is an expensive activity. In fact, were it not for journalists famously low salaries, the returns on investment for news acquisition would be unsustainable.",1362502814

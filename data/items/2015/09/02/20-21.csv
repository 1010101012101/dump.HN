Try another teacher or school, a different group. All these things come in many varieties and it can be a challenge to find what works for you. Each experience brings you closer to what you want, teaches you something.

Sure, I&#x27;ll keep tuned for the next post on this topic, but I fail to see how --without exclusive locking-- it could be done based on these principles.<p>* Every read seems like it needs to check the switch. I understand this might be expensive, specially if there is a concurrent modification in progress.

Maybe I would say no.<p>How about if the offer also said that &quot;the way we pay for this is by scanning the data we collect.  That way we can sell ad space to businesses near your common driving areas.  They never get your actual data but a shop on your morning commute will pay us to show their ads to people that may pass by.&quot;  Maybe I would still agree.  Or maybe I&#x27;d think, &quot;eh....I dunno.  Raw data for discounts is one thing but analyzing it for third parties seems sketchy.&quot;  Again, my choice in general even if I don&#x27;t ever know the exact workings of the software and transactions or any of the third party businesses buying ad space.<p>I think of it more like contract law and knowing (at least broadly) what you&#x27;re agreeing to before you sign.<p>To continue this ludicrously oversimplified example, let&#x27;s say I agree to the terms because on one hand, all this targeted advertising seems a little tacky or creepy but on the other hand, it really does beat getting blasted with ads for stores in other towns or items I&#x27;d never buy.  Plus hey...the discounts on gas mean I&#x27;m spending $50 less every month!<p>Well, without my knowledge, the local Drug Enforcement Agency has decided that the best way to stop trafficking is to either secretly demand all the data collected by this ads-for-fuel service or just install some dodgy new data collection towers that connect to the tracking widget and intercept it all without anyone&#x27;s knowledge.<p><i>That</i> is the point where I have a problem.  It&#x27;s not that I expect complete privacy in public.  If law enforcement wants to get a warrant to track my car because they think I&#x27;m a criminal suspect, that&#x27;s something that can happen. But to demand (or just take) mass amounts of data that was only volunteered for other uses is just not cool.<p>Maybe my animosity comes from thinking that if the state wants all of this info, they ought to develop their own ways of getting it, rather than just taking advantage of legit services that people choose to use.  Or maybe if they just came out and said &quot;we&#x27;re putting a tracker on everyone&#x27;s car&quot; people would go apeshit.<p>It&#x27;s like if you can&#x27;t convince everyone to submit to tracking by the state/law enforcement, just wait until someone else develops a service everyone wants to sign up for, then demand or steal their data.",1441225978

The other possible generalisations were much more complex, and the nature for some reason tend to favour simplicity, so it was reasonable to go that way (as well as it is very reasonable now to go out and test all the possible extensions of the Standard Model, starting with the simplest ones).",1441225570

(If Go weren&#x27;t popular, nobody would bother.)<p>I suspect it&#x27;s also partly due to Go&#x27;s curious mix of maturity and immaturity, in an overall promising package with lots of momentum. Here&#x27;s a young language that on the one hand is productive to work with and simple to understand, yet so obstinately awkward and inelegant in several other respects, and represented by a team of designers who aren&#x27;t always saying what many want to hear.<p>It&#x27;s clear that Go was, first and foremost, designed for Google and their need for a natively-compiled, concurrent language that steers the user to a very specific path, largely defined by <i>limitations</i>. Its approach prevents language-theoretic cleverness that can complicate a codebase (think Boost or the STL), and it prevents a lot of foot-shooting and optimistic overdesign that newbies are prone to.<p>But while that&#x27;s wonderful for Google, that&#x27;s also a frustrating to developers who don&#x27;t need this invisible hand hobbling them, and sees Go&#x27;s potential subverted by the stringent design principles. I admit I&#x27;m one of those frustrated by Go&#x27;s type system, for example, or its heavy-handed approach to error handling.<p>Part of the frustration is the lack of a clear alternative: Nimrod doesn&#x27;t have the mindshare, Rust is overly complex and slow to compile, Elixir doesn&#x27;t have the performance, C++ is, well, C++. Go, for better or worse, fills a kind of sweet spot that, unfortunately, also has a dash of sour. And that kind of frustration easily leads to debate whenever Go comes up.",1441224363

10161583,comment,10157227,10160028,0,0,ttctciyf,,,"> buzzwords<p>Ok, so apologies for that - the point I was trying to make is that PI&#x27;s view of &quot;meaning is use&quot; is consonant with some quite recent and popular (and therefore buzzword-prone) ideas about AI and psychology.<p>Right at the start of PI, the &quot;Augustinian picture&quot; of meaning is set out: &quot;words in language name objects - sentences are combinations of such names&quot; a picture where &quot;every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.&quot; And so (later, #81) we &quot;think that if anyone utters a sentence, and <i>means</i> or <i>understands</i> it, he is operating a calculus according to definite rules.&quot; This is the view of language which PI aims to - sorry, buzzword incoming - disrupt.<p>By contrast, PI puts the case that there is no central unifying model applicable to all instances of language use, rather: &quot;I am saying that these phenomena have no one thing in common which makes us use the same word for all - but that they are related to one another in many different ways, and it is because of this relationship, or these relationships that we call them all language.&quot; (PI #65)<p>There follows a discussion of vagueness. In the Augustinian picture where the meaning of a word is an object, and a calculus of these objects is performed, it is difficult to avoid the consequence that meanings are exact. PI uses the example of defining the word &quot;game&quot;: &quot;How should we explain to someone what a game is? I imagine that we should describe <i>games</i> to him, and we might add: &quot;This <i>and similar things</i> are called &#x27;games&#x27;&quot;. And do we know any more about it ourselves? [...] But this is not ignorance. We do not know the boundaries because none have been drawn. [...] we can draw a boundary - for a special purpose. Does it take that to make the concept usable? Not at all! [...] One might say that the concept &#x27;game&#x27; is a concept with blurred edges.&quot;<p>So much for &quot;decentralised&quot; and &quot;statistical&quot;. As far as &quot;emergent&quot; goes, I think even with the large variance in readings of PI it&#x27;s uncontroversial to say that it seeks to ground meaning and understanding in relation to &quot;customs&quot; or social practices rather than in some variety of metaphysical correspondence between language and reality required by different variations of the Augustinian picture. In this sense, meaning emerges from the use of words relative to these cultural forms.<p>Connectionism, as an investigative paradigm, (oops, buzzword!) is simpler (I believe) in that it doesn&#x27;t require the identification of an actual realised model (or &quot;mental mechanism&quot;) such as a neural encoding of a &quot;language of thought&quot; or cognitive frames, etc., in the brain - it &quot;just&quot; requires that a bunch of simple elements can result in complex rule-following behaviour without needing to explicitly encode the rules. Hopefully the quotes above will go some way to indicate how this programme is philosophically somewhat in tune with PI.<p>(Indeed the extensive sections on samples and teaching language games are eerily reminiscent of descriptions of training neural nets, now that I think of it... &quot;How do I explain the meaning of &#x27;regular&#x27;, &#x27;uniform&#x27;, &#x27;same&#x27; [...] if a person has not yet got the <i>concepts</i>? I shall teach him to use the words by means of <i>examples</i> and by <i>practice</i> - And when I do this I do not communicate less to him than I know myself.&quot; (PI #208))",1441224304

This is possible for both human and machine processes.<p>At the same time, it&#x27;s simply unreasonable to expect any given person using a search engine to consume and reliably evaluate all available information on a topic. The cost in time is too high, and the person will often lack the required expertise.<p>With these in mind, do you have an alternative proposal?",1441224189

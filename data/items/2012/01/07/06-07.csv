I have only been working full time since 2004, and since then my salary has gone from 30k to 110k.  I have never taken a job that paid less than the previous one, and on a few occasions I have used competing offers to get raises, or just taken the other job.  People may look down on the fact that I have worked for 5 companies in 5 years, but at the same time I have learned a great deal, experienced lots of vastly different company cultures, and I've increased my salary by double in the past 3 years alone.<p>The secret to getting large salary increases when switching jobs and to avoid getting held back by salary history is to show how you are worth more to the new company than you were to the old one.  For example, when I took a job that paid 50k as a junior PHP dev, I spent a year learning object oriented PHP5 and payment processing.  I used this experience to land a job paying 58k working on high traffic sites where I learned caching, scaling, and performance tuning.  I used this experience to get a job paying 70k working on an advanced ad serving platform running on a cluster of 50 servers, where I learned about load balancing.  I used this experience to get a job paying 96k working for ClearChannel, working on syndicated radio shows, where I learned about streaming audio and video.  This experience landed me at a stealth mode startup where I'm making 110k plus stock options.  Each step of the way, the experience I gained at the last job made me more valuable than my last salary, so the new company offered more, and I didn't even have to ask the first few times (though the last two times, the same recruiter did the asking on my behalf).",1325918426

As I was leaving the venue, I saw a piece of paper on a table that said the keynote speaker was Steve Wozniak. And I thought, I gotta hang around for this. So I went into the auditorium and sat down next to a beautiful young lady named Julie Roebuck. I introduced myself, and she did the same. Turns out she was Steve Wozniaks executive assistant.<p>Q: Now theres a handy coincidence.\nBradford: Id say so. I told her about my background, and she said, You have to meet Steve. Hell be thrilled to talk to another tech guy. So after his keynote, I went up, shook his hand and told him all about Fusion-io. The conversation ended with me saying, Gosh, would you like to be on our advisory board?<p>Q: That takes guts!\nBradford: Youd think so. But I believed in what we were doing. So I sent him an e-mail invitation later that night, and within 24 hours I got a reply back saying hed be honored to join our team. I thought, Are you kidding me? How did we do that? Woz gets opportunities like this thrown at him constantly, and to have him accept was a complete privilege and thrill. But the best part? After meeting with Fusion-ios executives, David Flynn and Rick White, Steve asked to play a larger role in the company.<p>Q: Now thats a compliment.\nBradford: It was crazy. How does this little Utah-based tech company do that? In retrospect  and I say this somewhat tongue and cheek  it may just be the greatest hire in the history of technology companies.<p>Q: And it all started because you picked up a flier.\nBradford: Sometimes the best jobs and opportunities are ones you walk in on.",1325918407

Anti-discrimination laws still apply, even in at-will states in the USA, but all that means is that the employer has to state that they fired the employee for ANYTHING ELSE, even if it's actually for a discriminatory reason.<p>2. Being fired without cause means gives greater opportunity  for employers to abuse their employees - and, considering the general principles of game theory, it WILL happen.<p>3. Notice vs. cause can be separate things, but many people nowadays don't have the ability to survive longer than a couple of weeks to a few months without a job, and being fired without any notice can literally ruin someone's life.<p>Again, this is only a personal view - I'm no economist, and I don't pretend to have all the answers.

Labour and tax laws aren't the same everywhere in Europe, and the Hungarian economy is hardly representative of the EU's.<p>Reproducing Silicon Valley is another story. Arguably it's very hard to do even in NY or other parts of US that are more or less similar to California. After all, labour law is just one of many factors. For instance, even with all that overhead, I bet it's still much cheaper to hire a bunch of top-notch, English-speaking programmers in Hungary than in California.",1325917199

You don't have to have the 'buffer' budget over actual costs that corporations do.  Large companies typically offer paid vacation, matching 401k, disability leave, maternity leave and all that jazz.<p>If you're working on a lean startup right now, ask yourself what would happen if your lead developer disappeared for three months.<p>This is one of the real disadvantages we face as a nation because, in large part, the people we outsource labor to don't have these protections.",1325916553

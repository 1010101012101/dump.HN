a==20 and last update was by d5 before everyone went offline.<p>When the devices come back up, the fate of &quot;a&quot; depends on the rulesets. Following are 3 possible high-level combinations.<p>i) All devices have &quot;remote&quot; rule. 
   On reconnection, everyone rollback &quot;a&quot; to 20. They are essentially back to the time before going offline. Even the device which did the last update(d5) before going offline is rolled back too, which seems bit odd. Still simple to reason with..<p>ii) All devices have &quot;local&quot; rule.
    On reconnection, the last device to reconnect updates &quot;a&quot;. It is then broadcasted to all other devices.  Note that
 it is <i>not</i> the last device to update &quot;a&quot;. Rather it is the last to reconnect (Now, even if all of them reconnect at same time, depending on the queueing at server, the one at the tail wins). Not really simple..<p>iii) Mix of &quot;remote&quot; and &quot;local&quot;
    Let&#x27;s say d1 had &quot;local&quot; rule and all others had &quot;remote&quot;. On reconnection, d1&#x27;s &quot;a&quot; will be propagated to everyone. This is irrespective of the order of reconnection (I am assuming that between reconnections &quot;a&quot; is not modified). This is pretty simple and perfectly predictable. Now, if we have more than one &quot;local&quot;, we start getting non-deterministic, and at the extreme move to case ii)",1377950384

I&#x27;m also a Blue Card holder living in Berlin, and as a US citizen, I was able to enter Germany on a tourist visa and then apply for the Blue Card from here. However, a friend of mine from the Philippines was in a very similar situation (got a job offer while he was here on a tourist visa) and he had to return home to apply for the Blue Card, since the Philippines are not on that short list of exempted countries. Your girlfriend&#x27;s case was indeed different, since she wasn&#x27;t trying to convert from a tourist visa.<p>Here are a couple of resources on the matter:<p><a href=""http://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/working/guide-to-working-in-germany/visa/#citizens-of-other-states"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/working/guide-to-workin...</a><p>Particularly the three paragraphs starting with &quot;You must apply for your visa in your home country before travelling to Germany.&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/bewerbung/en/9199-visa-entry-into-the-country/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/bewerbung/e...</a><p>Starting around &quot;Important!

6306555,comment,6305021,6306300,1,0,dalke,,,"The police were not involved until after the plaintiff fell through the skylight. The plaintiff was unable to move. How is this &quot;escaping the police&quot; in any sense of the phrase?<p>As to &quot;He sued the people he was robbing and won&quot;, this is a blunt view of the world that should not be used as the sole basis for deciding culpability.<p>Consider &quot;I was going 10 mph over the 55 mph speed limit when the engine of my car caught fire. I sued the car company because of their faulty engine design. We were able to show that several other cars of the same model also caught fire at 65 mph, and the company knew about them, but the company hadn&#x27;t done anything about it. I sued, but because I was breaking the law when it happened, I got nothing.&quot;<p>In your view, is that appropriate?<p>Consider &quot;That night I shoplifted a pack of gum from the store. While still in the parking lot, I fell into an open manhole. The store had left it open for a week, without any signs or barriers, and the outside lights weren&#x27;t turned on. I hit my head and was in a coma for 10 days. They refused to accept any liability, because it was part of my crime of stealing the gum.&quot;<p>In your view, is that appropriate?<p>In both hypotheticals, the lawbreaker &quot;was injured while committing a crime&quot;, so I assume the answer to both questions is &quot;yes.&quot;<p>I disagree. The commission of a crime should not automatically revalue one&#x27;s life and health to $0.<p>In addition, how much proof does there need to be to establish that someone has committed a crime, before the owner&#x27;s immunity kicks in? Does the person need only to be accused of a crime, or does a full criminal conviction need to take place first?<p>Do you really want there to be more criminal cases in order to reduce the number of (rare) civil cases? Or do you really want the property owners to make arbitrary claims, for the purpose of avoiding liability?<p>&quot;The litigous environment to which this case history refers has gotten worse, not better.&quot;<p>I regard that is a statement of opinion not based in fact. For example, California Civil Code Section 847 ( <a href=""http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/847.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/847.html</a> ), which was passed after the above lawsuit, says:<p>> An owner, including, but not limited to, a public entity,
as defined in Section 811.2 of the Government Code, of any estate or
any other interest in real property, whether possessory or
nonpossessory, shall not be liable to any person for any injury or
death that occurs upon that property during the course of or after
the commission of any of the felonies set forth in subdivision (b) by
the injured or deceased person.<p>Isn&#x27;t that exactly what you want for this sort of case? If not, what should the law be?",1377949138

I highly encourage reading it all, as well as the articles linked within.<p>I had not been aware of this &#x27;sharing movement&#x27;, and how this perspective was being force-fed by some SV folks. And now that I&#x27;ve found about it I find this to be very off-putting, I was expecting better from SV.<p>The BI article on TaskRabbit (<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/confessions-of-a-task-rabbit-2011-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/confessions-of-a-task-rabbit-...</a>) I think nicely outlines the problems with this wave of &#x27;sharing&#x27; startups:<p><pre><code>    The whole thing about TaskRabbit, again it&#x27;s &quot;neighbors 
    helping neighbors,&quot; as if my health and safety don&#x27;t 
    matter, as if I&#x27;m willing to put up with whatever you 
    dish out no matter what.  And it&#x27;s required that 
    TaskRabbits always have a smile on their faces.  You 
    know what, I&#x27;m not going to smile at you while you lie. 
    It&#x27;s a health factor, it&#x27;s a safety risk.  I don&#x27;t want 
    to get covered in cat shit and if I do, I should know 
    about it and get paid for it. 

    There really is an element of disregard for the 
    Rabbits. Then the email I got from TaskRabbit about 
    being unprofessional  my answer to that is, if you 
    actively suppress what you actually foster, it is 
    abuse. Then people will figure out that they can lie 
    and manipulate the TaskRabbits to get what they want. 

    BI: Do TaskRabbits ever meet?

    Not so much.  I&#x27;ve met a couple of them because either 
    I&#x27;ve posted tasks myself or I was assigned a task that 
    involved another TaskRabbit.  That&#x27;s part of the 
    strategy of TaskRabbit  to keep us apart from one 
    another.  We can&#x27;t message each other on the website. 
    The only way you get to meet another TaskRabbit is if 
    you post a task, and I think they do this to keep us 
    apart because they don&#x27;t want us fixing the process. 
    They don&#x27;t want us unionizing.  They don&#x27;t want us to 
    get together and say an Ikea run is $50 minimum. 

    If it&#x27;s a $25 job, how much will TaskRabbit take?

    Here&#x27;s how it works.  I wish I had access to their back 
    end numbers.  Certainly a task that costs, let&#x27;s say, 
    $30 or more, the markup is actually about 70%.  At a 
    lower price point the markup is smaller and it could be 
    as low as 15%.  For example, if I bid $20 on a grocery 
    run, the poster will probably pay a price of $23.  So 
    that is fair.

    But as the price goes up, so does the cut.  And I know 
    once you hit about $30 for the task, the markup is 70%.

You assume an efficient market (something that does not and probably cannot exist at scale, if at all).  You assume information equality, which is the exact opposite of actual practice, you assume the people who make the hiring decisions have some means of separating the average from the above or below average.  In practice development skill is a completely separate and unrelated skill to marketing (of one&#x27;s self).  Ability derives from the former, salary from the latter.<p>So no, unrestricted labour movement most definitely does <i>not</i> mean you get paid average if you are average (not that I care about this anyway: I think <i>all</i> developer pay should go up across the board).  What it will mean is employer perception will be that they should be able to get even better talent at even lower prices.  And since employers can wait literally years to fill positions and people can rarely go more than a month without a job, this will certainly drive salaries down even further.<p>Of course, one could imagine that eventually everything would become more efficient and companies should recognise that better developers cost more.  But how many companies actually care about having better developers?  For the majority of IT jobs, the hiring company doesn&#x27;t care about developer quality, they care about costs.  If development takes longer, so what.  Everyone else in their market will be working under the same constraints so it doesn&#x27;t matter.",1377947118

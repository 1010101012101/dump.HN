You went and looked for them and found some that sound similar. The ""hacker"" in me would most likely have been coding this prior to even thinking about patents.

You need a more competitive and innovative supply than what we have, which is what vouchers can help with.<p>I have a middle ground: Require all charter schools to be ""open-source"": Open accounting books for everyone to see. Don't cap profits, don't restrict teacher pay, simply make all charter schools show what people are spending for the education they're getting.<p>The results of the charter schools' performances will show in the quality of the children coming out, as well as (potentially) by some ostensibly neutral, non-binding ratings agency. The only thing that can let a charter school be forced to shut down would be blatant fraud as defined by money laundering or other abuses (aka not tied to performance).",1292565432

2015385,comment,2015176,2015176,0,0,hsmyers,,,"First thing to do is realize that for many (most?) older programmers, this is the norm. Being self-taught in the days before Programming as a major or Comp-Sci for that matter isn't a new thing for the profession. That said, best thing to do is to continue the methods/procedures that got you to where you are. Learn more, read more. There are always other languages to learn and certainly more books to read. There are many lists of 'Best Computer Books for Language Foo' out there as well as 'Best Computer Books in General'--- find them and start at the top, bottom, middle, where ever you want. I tend to divide reading into what I think of as the classics and the practical; the classics are programming texts that apply to all languages, the practical are those that apply to a particular language. When it comes to reading in general, remember Sturgeon's Law--- '90% of everything is crap' this is particularly true for the 'practical' category, so spend time reading in the bookstore before plunking down cash...",1292565402

Recently I went to shop for a compact camera with no particular brand in mind, I went to the shop, checked out what's on offer, and read the reviews on the spot via my iPhone. This process helped me to weed out a few cameras, and finally I got a camera (Canon Ixus 130) at a price that I am happy with. Since I already know the pros and cons of this camera, I must say I am quite happy with my purchase as it removes a lot of uncertainty from the purchase (No, AFAIK, most shops in Singapore don't provide refund or exchange for purchases...)",1292565102

I just can’t imagine that it was a huge expense.<p>An analogy.<p>I travel a lot, sometimes ""living on the road"" for quite a while at a time. It's a marvelous life.<p>I <i>carefully</i> consider what I pack. Every little thing takes space and weight, which means less space/weight for something else.<p>A friend of mine was with me when I was doing some packing, and I was looking at my Kindle charger and iPhone charger. Both of the USB plugs can plug into an adapter so it can plug into a power outlet.<p>Turns out, Kindle and iPhone USB-to-outlet adapter are the same, and it works for both devices. I tested it, and then was weighing them and trying to size up their durability to choose which one to keep.<p>My friend said, ""Why not keep both? They're small, and maybe there'll be problems later if you don't have both...""<p>And you know what? He's right. I could totally make the judgmental call to keep both of them, and it'd make no real difference on my space/weight. The problem is, there's 10-15 other little things I have to make the same judgment call on, and it adds up fast.<p>Sometimes you have to cut, even if this particular cut doesn't mean anything significant, because making 10-15 cuts really does add up to something significant.<p>This doesn't make Yahoo's decision here a good call or a bad call. But it's something to think about when anyone says ""This one isn't too [expensive/heavy/big/cumbersome/time-intensive]"" - no, maybe not, but little costs can add up fast.",1292563924

2015322,comment,2015284,2015284,0,0,photon_off,,,"I posted this when I first launched at the end of July; and I figured it's relevant to share it again to show just how useful Delicious data is.  Moreofit.com has an index of about 250,000 websites and their tag weights, courtesy of Delicious.com.  They're normalized and stored in a manner that allows for a somewhat efficient kNN search to be applied for a given set of tags.  The results:  For a given URL, you can see the ""closest"" URLs in 50,000+ dimensional tag space.  If you go into ""custom tag search"" you can very the weights of the tags and explore the tag space that way, also.<p>More precisely:  each website has a vector of approximately 50,000 dimensions, 49,990 of which are 0, but 10 of which have a value.  The ""closest"" URLs in this space are those which have the smallest distance from the searched URL.  I've thought of doing singular value decomposition, but frankly never got around to it, because the results are really quite good.  This is just the tip of the iceburg -- I'm sure delicious has well over 10,000,000 URLs.<p>Delicious.com has an extremely rich set of data:  A very large, and arguably the most relevant, portion of the web has been described by hand#, by real people, with no incentive to cheat or skew the results. The amount of man-hours spent tagging and organizing the web is really astounding, and I'm glad I managed to make something useful out of it.<p>I really hope Yahoo comes to their senses and realizes how valuable this data is.  Just combining URL (or domain) popularity into search results offers so much more value.  One could create a killer search engine with this data.<p>#:  A lot of the end results of tag weights has to do with how the URL was initially tagged, as a lot of people opt to use ""auto-tagging"" which just copies the most popular tags.  Not only are the end results of tagging quite interesting, but I suspect researching how a URLs popularity and description has ebbed and flowed over time would be awesome.",1292563709

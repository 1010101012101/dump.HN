61593,comment,61006,61006,0,0,liz,,,"Thank you for taking the time to share what you learned and your observations. As a woman in business, I can understand how many of these comments hold true for women in general, but I think there is something to be said about the kind of work environment a woman chooses. Having worked in both startup and corporate environments, my personal experience in a corporate position mirrored what was discussed among the women in the lecture. The women I worked among opted for the security, professionalism, and ""ladder"" that a larger corporation provides. <p>On the other hand, my experience with startups has been different. Startups foster empowerment and allow the flexibility to effect change almost immediately.  Sure there may have been slight differences in approaches among the different genders, but ultimately everyone works to achieve the same goal. My experience in this kind of environment contradicts most of the points made. There is risk, criticism and recognition despite gender. I tend to gravitate towards startup opportunities and have actually submitted a YC application. (fingers crossed!) <p>Keep in mind, that I am just one woman so my observations may not reflect what women generally experience in the working world. Thanks again for sharing, I found your post incredibly interesting. \n",1191245947

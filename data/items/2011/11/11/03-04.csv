After all, those investors got the shares at pennies on the dollar.<p>Early employees who have shares are also investors, but they pay with their time and skill.  I look at the vesting period as an insurance policy for the firm that an employee who turns out to be extremely valuable won't decide to quit b/c of the ongoing upside.<p>The only incentive the company should have to keep any employee should be that employee's ongoing value to the company.  Sure the founder might feel loyal to some of the employees, but his/her job is to allocate resources to pick the best talent, not to wallow in sentimentality.  Even a company like Zynga hasn't ""made it"", there is still a lot more work to do.<p>Firing an employee before he/she is fully vested is akin to canceling an insurance policy.

3223263,comment,3188609,3197045,1,0,dkubb,,,"Ripper can only parse static source, while ParseTree can give you the AST as it is at runtime. So with Ripper you give it the name of a file/line number and it can parse it, but it can't get any contextual information available at runtime, or anything that might've changed at runtime. With ParseTree I can give it a Proc object and it can parse it in whatever state it is at that point in time.<p>In a nutshell, how sourcify works is it gets the source_location for the Proc, which gives you the file name and line number. It uses Ripper to parse the file, and the Proc starting at that line number. It provides an object that can be fed into SexpProcessor to extract information about the block of code within the Proc.<p>Since it's bound to Proc#source_location one of the limitations is it can't distinguish between two or more Proc objects defined on one line (eg users.select { |u| u.id == 1 }.select{ |u| u.name == 'John Doe' }).

Adobe has been making moves for a while now to change Flash into a development environment for full-fledged applications. What do you think Flex and AIR are for? The Flash Player is going away and I'm willing to bet Adobe could care less. There will be a day we will not install Flash Player in our browser at all, but most likely we'll still install AIR.<p>By the way, I'm one of those that believes Jobs initially banned Flash on iOS devices as a business tactic. Without allowing a third-party to create tools for the iOS platform then that would mean you would have to go all in on Apple products for development. Flash on iOS meant a Windows developer could create an app for the iPhone and that goes against Apple's business model. They eventually backed off. I believe they did so because they overstepped and banned ALL third-party tools including alternate scripting languages to be used inside the app. That was stupid as they almost banned a rather large number of games that were using scripting languages for game scripting code, such Lua.<p>Also, Adobe has been supporting HTML5 technologies since almost day one in their products that are not Flash.

Mark Pincus is a classic psychopath and it's always educational to observe how people like him attempt to justify themselves.<p>The psychopath's language is usually a caricature (sometimes to the point of absurdity) of going assumptions of the culture in which he's trying to win acceptance. Though they have no values, they are skilled at picking up others' values and using them to make their actions seem acceptable. In Pincus's case, he's taking the noble concept of meritocracy and twisting it into bizarre shapes, refusing to stop even at outright fraud.<p>Oh, and if I understand Mr. Pinkus right, people who work with food don't deserve to make money. Fucker.<p>Judging his attitudes from his writing and actions, he'd be a natural fit for the Tea Party. Since the Tea Party and Zynga are the two malefactors most responsible for insufferable activity on Facebook, this is a natural transition for Mr. Pincus.<p>To the screwed: sorry to hear it, but I guess this is what you get when you work for a company whose name sounds like 4th-grade anatomical slang.",1320982483

3223233,comment,3222511,3222511,8,0,fragsworth,,,"The whole situation can be fairly simply explained: a conflict exists between rapidly-growing companies and their early employees. It's kind of a flaw in the way the system works, and it's not really just for pre-IPO companies.<p>A common situation is an early ""non-essential"" employee receives something like 0.25% of the company, vested over 4 years. Suppose that at the time the employee is hired, this 0.25% is worth $10,000 or so ($4 million valuation). If the company manages to grow 100x in value, the company is now paying a non-essential employee $250,000/year in stock. With at-will employment, the company can legally fire them.<p>The conflict arises because there is no <i>legal</i> incentive for the company to keep this employee at this point. Fortunately, it's not all that bad for the employees as long as they have <i>some</i> vested stock since this problem only arises if the stock value gets too high.",1320982170

If Zynga had had $50m to begin with they wouldn't have given out options. What they offered, instead, was a 0.5% shot at $50m.<p>It's a fundamental concept of contract law that the damages for breaching a contract are what are necessary to put the aggrieved party in the same position he would've been but for the breach. The rule exists precisely for this sort of scenario: when people bargain up front about highly uncertain things like this, they come to an understanding about risk/reward, potential cost and potential upside. In retrospect one party or the other is almost certainly going to get more or less than he or she expected. If courts didn't hold people to their promises, one party would nearly always have an incentive to back out, and nobody would ever enter into uncertain transactions.<p>What Zynga is doing is at best unethical. The rub here is that we're dealing with unvested options. If it were trying to force employees to give up vested options it wouldn't be just unethical, it would be straight-up illegal. An options contract is a property interest, and can be readily valued in this circumstance.<p>Even dealing with unvested options Zynga might've opened themselves up to liability. ""At will employment"" doesn't mean ""anything goes."" Also, the contract the employees had re: the options could be a second source of liability.",1320982153

3223172,comment,3222869,3222869,1,0,jiggy2011,,,"One of the main advantages for windows is that backwards compatibility is excellent (I can generally run programs for Win95 without getting into some weird dependancy hell) and I have never had a big update (like a service pack) totally break everything like I have had with pretty much every linux distro I have ever tried.<p>One thing I never really understand is why people complain about windows RAM usage, especially on recent versions. RAM is cheap and you have about 8GB of it , why are you complaining about it showing usage of 2GB after boot? You didn't buy all that memory for it not to be used, surely most of this usage is due to windows preloading commonly used DLLS into memory at bootup so parts of the system can load faster?<p>I heard at one point that data to be preloaded is deliberately organized into contiguous blocks on disk so it can be read quickly in one pass, giving an overall performance win vs seeking all over the disk later trying to load in bits of DLLS to run a program?<p>I'm sure somebody can correct me on the details of that.<p>I'm not sure the security argument is even particularly valid anymore, is there really any concrete reason that a Unix OS has an inherent advantage over an NT based system?<p>I think allot of the issues stem from the culture (or pherhaps lack of it). Linux users are generally happy with their open source software from aptitute , whilst Mac users only tend to use a small number of good quality commercial apps. On the other hand a huge number of windows apps seem to be 'freeware' type apps that make their money by bundling crapware, also there is more pirated software used which I suppose would be more likely to have viruses bundled. I generally stick to either open source or fully paid up commercial software on my Windows 7 box and I've not had any real problems.",1320980460

That would provide two advantages: it would handle slight misspellings, and it would find the closest match first (""radius"" would prefer ""border-radius"" to ""border-top-left-radius"", and ""border"" would prefer ""border"" as requested in another comment).<p>You might consider providing a quick list of the property names (perhaps over on the right) in addition to the fully expanded list, to make it easier to tell if you have the right results, and jump to them in the list.<p>Please put the ""[source]"" links closer to the content; right now they seem more closely associated with the following entry.  How about putting the link near the top right of each entry instead?<p>Please don't fade the ""default"" and ""inherited"" text so close to white; I found it uncomfortable to read with that little contrast.",1320980455

It's something I would want to beleive.<p>But, I find his analysis a little suspect. It appears to confuse corellation and causation. It notices a difference in behavior between the ""great"" and the ""average"" and assumes those differences to cause the difference in ability.<p>It completely ignores the possibility that the behavioral difference might be caused by a difference in ability, rather than the behavior changing the ability.<p>Also, another problem is that student classification is based on faculty opinion. The fact that students with a class of behavior tend to be liked more by their instructors implies something about the instructors, not the students. It does not measure music ability. It measures the ability to be perceived positively by music professors.<p>I would be interested to see a study that actually measures music ability, using set learning time frames with unfamiliar pieces and double blind assessment of music samples.<p>If that was correlated with behavior, then it might mean something.<p>The best the study can say is ""if you want music teachers in Berlin to rate you highly, then behave this way"".",1320980412

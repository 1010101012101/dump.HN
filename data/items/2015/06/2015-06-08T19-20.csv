Also I am by no means arguing that the past was in any way better to the present, just that it is quite possible to be happy without a lot of material wealth.<p>However, in regard to the probable happiness of the average 18th century family, I still think most research on happiness would disagree with you. People seem to have a default level of contentment that varies only temporarily when major positive or negative changes occur in their lives: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill</a> This suggests that being thankful they survived to see another day, while grim by our standards, actually <i>was</i> real happiness.<p>Exceptions to this, that is, things that make lasting changes to one&#x27;s happiness include:<p>* A supportive community of peers with whom you meet regularly<p>* Regular physical exertion<p>* Regular time for quiet reflection<p>* Marriage<p>* True and devout belief in a religion.<p>Our average 18th century family had all of these.<p>On the other hand, modern society has a greater capacity for a person to self-actualize and get into a path where they are able to regularly enter a state of flow, which is also shown to increase happiness.

How is this centralization?  I still think you&#x27;re just arguing that we&#x27;ve compartmentalized certain services to <i>sets</i> of companies, for the most part, but even that isn&#x27;t centralization, because there are multiple distinct companies using multiple distinct networks and in many cases they are presenting multiple distinct capabilities.  Not having something handled at the end point does not mean it&#x27;s centralized, there&#x27;s a very large middle ground here, and that&#x27;s where we are currently at.  I&#x27;m not sure I see any evidence that we are moving away from that towards actual centralization.<p>> When I received mail in &#x27;95 or so the machine receiving it was the workstation I wrote the reply on.<p>And many people that used POP3 continued to do so well into the 2000&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s silly to run a mail server on your workstation.  I know, I did it for years myself.  You run into all sorts of stupid problems related to your workstation not being always on, badly configured backup MX servers, and other issues.  We don&#x27;t do it anymore not because we were forced out of it (you can still do it now), but because there are solutions that are better for most use cases, and we opt for those.<p>We don&#x27;t all wash our own cars, or do our own plumbing, or even clean our own houses.  Some people do, some people pay others to do that work.  The fact they pay others doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;ve moved towards centralizing those services.  There isn&#x27;t some national bureau of plumbing that is our only recourse when the toilet is clogged and we don&#x27;t want to fix it ourselves.",1433793185

It&#x27;s great at getting you going but competitive athletes use more advanced programs.<p>I personally use college football lifting programs. These are built to get the maximum out of athletes in the span of four years and focus on building an all-around athletic strength, not just maxing out the big three lifts. Because of the nature of football, the competitiveness, and the revenue it generates, the lifting programs have to be on the cutting edge. The strength programs tend to be shared only within football circles. The teams keep meticulous track of players&#x27; maxes and are constantly tweaking their programs and collaborating with other strength and conditioning experts to get the maximum out of their players. And they actually have the data where they can compare success of last year&#x27;s program with this year&#x27;s with a hundred or so data points, which allows them to make faster iterations on their programs.<p>If you look the numbers that college football players can put up in olys and powerlifting, so many of them technically qualify for nationals in those sports. Even though lifting isn&#x27;t their main focus. For example, my brother played D-I ball and had a 1,604 lb three lift total by his junior year. That&#x27;s 243 lbs higher than the collegiate powerlifting qualifier for nationals (in his weight class) and he was by no means a freakish outlier for his team or conference strength-wise.

Apple could have got my attention if they had done this from the start, but at this point I find it hard to get excited about this. Half the reason I find myself drawn to a new language is the culture and community surrounding it. You might think this seems silly at first glance, they&#x27;re programming languages, not fraternities. But hear me out.<p>Golang is a pragmatic crowd. Go into #go-nuts on freenode, you&#x27;ll notice that discussion rarely deviates from solving problems. Many links to the go playground. Go, from the beginning, shaped their community in this way. Consciously? Who knows. But the community turned out the way it did and I believe that&#x27;s a result of their start.<p>Haskell is a computer scientist crowd. People write in haskell because they enjoy the functional paradigm and haskell is a purely functional language. Discussion on freenode? Very dense. People are expected to grasp topics easily and the community initially gives everyone the benefit of the doubt that they are capable of understanding it until they ask for more help.<p>When I look at swift, the only thought I have is that it is the new iOS language. I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;ll be able to deviate from that. I don&#x27;t see myself making iOS apps, so I don&#x27;t see myself every writing a single line of the language. When I first looked at swift, my impression was that it was a wierd and somewhat-functional language that had a few unique things. Maybe I would have taken an interest in it. But at this point, I don&#x27;t want to have to wade through a bunch of iOS specific questions to get what I need. I don&#x27;t want to have to deal with being a beta tester for their linux implementations. I don&#x27;t want to use the language when I&#x27;m probably going to be using it in a vastly different way than the rest of the community is. My interests are going to be second class.<p>It&#x27;s not necessarily set in stone, but I think it is.

Almost entirely around understanding G-d and connecting spiritually. This is not just how I feel, this is black and white fundamentals.

The story went that Apple&#x27;s execs actually had no idea how Spotify worked so thought they really had something.<p>It&#x27;s the kind of fiasco that would&#x27;ve earned the execs a bollicking in the Jobs days and, to me, the buck had to stop at Tim Cook.<p>I&#x27;m a paid Spotify subscriber. Generally I like it but it has its warts:<p>- They did an app update a few months ago that&#x27;s viewed as pretty much universally awful for reasons I can&#x27;t really explain;<p>- Their catalog has many holes (eg Australian music, in this case probably because Spotify doesn&#x27;t have an Australian service);<p>- I used to think artists were being Luddites by opting out but there&#x27;s actually good reason for this. They don&#x27;t earn royalties proportional to the actual plays. The royalty scheme imposed by the record companies gives a disproportionate amount to currently popular artists;<p>- Because of the last point you have artists who are missing or, in some cases, you have all their songs except their 1-2 money makers;<p>- Worse, for some songs, particularly for things from the 70s for some reason, you can&#x27;t get the original. You just get some shitty remaster that sounds like bad karaoke.<p>- Spotify&#x27;s radio feature is the real weak point for me. Repeats (sometimes with only a song in between) and the thumbing up and down I don&#x27;t think really has the desired effect. Like I might be on a good string of songs but I know the worst thing I can do is thumb anything up OR down as experience has taught me this can only make things worse.<p>Really &quot;thumbs up&quot; should probably mean &quot;don&#x27;t change anything&quot;. Or at least me listening to something in full is itself is a positive indicator.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m not really sure you can do satisfying recommendations here. So much of music is I think tied to memory and nostalgia. You might like a particular song because of a particular person, place, time or event. How does liking that inform any other music choice?<p>At the same time your radio playlist has to be large enough not to be too repetitive.<p>What&#x27;s more, there&#x27;s actually an art to playlist selection. It&#x27;s why, for example, at a concert you&#x27;ll generally see a band start with something upbeat, play anything a bit more mellow in the middle and finish on a high note.<p>Curated playlists (which I guess Apple is calling &quot;guest DJs&quot; because that&#x27;s what it amounts to) is an idea with some history (eg Songza, bought by Google last year I think).<p>I actually find myself listening to iHeartRadio a lot. I pick a music style I&#x27;m in the mood for and just try different stations until I find something not too objectionable. Sure there are DJs (99% irritating) and some ads but at least I don&#x27;t need to build a playlist, worry about what&#x27;s on Spotify and what isn&#x27;t or make a decision each song about whether to thumb it up or down. It&#x27;s it or nothing (well... something else).<p>Radio really has a low cognitive cost.",1433791131

And I believe that agrees with the naive intuition one has why the axiom of choice is true. The problem is when the logic allows proofs (or semantics) which does not preserve the equality. In type theory the equality is intensional and thus preserved by structure.<p>Unique choice is besides the point here. There may be a unique function, or there may be many. The intuition of choosing is the same.<p>I also have no issue with B-T, as I expect weird consequences of ZFC; the axioms and logic being so profoundly non-constructive and removed from my intuitions in the first place. That said, I would not deny the set-theorists enjoying their theory, I merely observe that there are subtle things their theories fail to describe.<p>Type theory does not shout anything, but is carefully constructed from the needs of its creators. Some  people want to extract algorithms from their proofs, or want to prove that their algorithms are correct.

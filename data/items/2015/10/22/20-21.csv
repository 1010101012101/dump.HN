The Plex server doesn&#x27;t really browse the filesystem, it scans folders for media files and then parses the names. If you follow their naming scheme with your files it does a great job pulling in metadata and such, but if not it doesn&#x27;t do so great.<p>You can subsequently choose to view files by &quot;folder&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t actually browse the filesystem directly but instead looks at the database to see where the file came from originally. My experience trying several times since Plex came out (most recently last year) is that this is extremely unreliable and wonky. It&#x27;d always mis-recognize files or they&#x27;d be completely missing even though they were on disk. They outright do not support directly browsing files AFAIK.<p>So in other words, if your files are reasonably well organized and named following one of the conventions recognized by Plex then it does a pretty amazing job organizing and scraping. On the other hand, if you just have random files that are scattered about or organized by folder or perhaps named differently then Kodi works a whole lot better because it just lets you drill through files on disk (it has a library too, which is functionally about the same as Plex and suffers from similar drawbacks). On the other hand, Plex has way better device support and while you can get transcoding to/from devices in Kodi, Plex is a lot better at it most of the time.",1445547261

Like for example, the datastore API you have access to for Go doesn&#x27;t even support geo-spatial data or queries.  I had to hack my own solution.  It made me pretty mad at the time, because how can you not support geospatial queries in a database in an age where mobile location-based apps are so ubiquitous.<p>So I can see why you would say the platform is stagnant.  And there is probably some truth in what you are saying in terms of GAE not getting the same love as other parts of the Google Cloud.<p>But having said that, I STILL think there is some merit to building apps on GAE, if your app is a simple web server, or single purpose REST API.

If the producer is so slow, that the consumer manages to ask 1000s of times for a product before it&#x27;s created, than we have a case for reactive events.<p>Game programming is different: the rate at which the events are produced greatly overwhelm the consumer rate (60 fps is nice target for graphics).<p>There is one exception though! I have found a very annoying issue in a lot of games: they sometimes drop input. If you happen to play some fast action game and the game is crunching too much for the moment and drops FPS, also assuming that input events are polled once per frame, then a lot of input events might go unnoticed. Only the last input state for one frame is recognized by the game logic, but there might have been more than one.<p>So, in my opinion, input handling would be better handled in a pull fashion, where all the events could be processed immediately, for example: the rotation matrix could be updated off the game loop many times between one frame. I hate all those 3d viewers which loose all interactivity if the scene is too large. It doesn&#x27;t have to be!",1445546964

I rarely found it worth my while engaging in a job with a new client if it billed under 10-15 days. $3500 is only a few days work, so they&#x27;ll have to ensure the administrative overhead in bidding and billing is minimised.<p>> Whoever has the lowest bid at the closing time will have 10 working days to ship the code necessary to satisfy the criteria. If the criteria are met, the vendor gets paid. It&#x27;s that easy. If the criteria aren&#x27;t met, the next lowest bidder gets 10 working days to ship the code. In order to make this work, we will provide acceptance criteria, instead of requirements. This limits the possibility of misinterpretation and ensures the quality of delivery.<p>I fear that the focus on tight acceptance criteria may encourage gaming the system. There&#x27;s no incentive for the contractor to do more than the bare minimum. Even if you gain a reputation with the procuring team of being reliable they still have to go with the lowest bidder for the next job.<p>For contractors, the optimum strategy would seem to be bid without spending any time coming up with an implementation strategy, then drop any jobs you win that don&#x27;t seem worthwhile after a few hours working out how to implement it.<p>Ultimately this becomes a test of how well the jobs can be specified. For this to be efficient they have to include the time spent internally preparing and assessing the result vs working over a longer periods with people with whom they can build a trusting working relationship.<p>It might be more efficient to rely less on price competition and more on reputation. That would make it a low overhead system for engaging trusted contractors on individual tickets. There&#x27;d be far less preparation required in defining very tight acceptance criteria.",1445546360

I have very little experience with Rx, but still I found some really useful applications for it:<p>1. Jumping between threads back and forth. This is a typical requirement of a UI Toolkit (Java Swing, Android). I don&#x27;t remember the exact details, but some special combinators (subscribeOnEdt) were provided out of the box by the library (was using rxScala then). You just connected button to some action, which result was displayed in a text field. With rxScala for Swing it was an extra function call. In plain JDK it&#x27;s an extreme pain (SwingWorker, SwingUtilities.invokeLater and custom Runnables or threads etc.)<p>2. Edge case handling in abstractions. Let&#x27;s say you want to implement a real time moving average of exactly 3 points, but discarding 10 first results. In Rx it is something of a &quot;Hello World&quot; level of complexity. The same thing, in plain Java, which also handles the edge cases correctly is almost always implemented buggy.<p>3. Event bookkeeping. If you happen to use push model a lot, a funny thing occurs. In case of UI applications some people call it a &quot;glitch&quot;. In electronic engineering this is a race condition (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition</a>). It&#x27;s a very fundamental problem, which is solved in rx implementation. The merge operator takes care, that the events fired are traversing the dependency graph in a topological order. That way, it is way harder to create that bug (not impossible though).<p>4. Error handling by default. This is also very very useful. A typical programmer in Java implements handling for all happy cases, few error conditions and most often than not, misses a lot of other error cases. &quot;Who would notice? Besides, exception handling in Java is really ugly.&quot; So yeah, they don&#x27;t write it. With RX the error condition handling is always present, by the means of termination message. Every combinator has a clearly defined semantics for handling those onComplete events. It&#x27;s just a matter of reifing exceptions and defining stream for error events. You could do it in Java of course, but the amount of boilerplate which is killed by handling this in rx is very impressive.",1445545155

It also means someone who is against the government infringing on social freedoms, like equality for people with different sexualities, genders, or races.<p>The classical usage of &quot;liberal&quot; means someone who supports <i>individual</i> freedom in every sense: lower taxes, fewer government programs, less government spending, and social freedom.<p>To make it even more confusing, the hard-right of the Republican Party claims to be &quot;liberal&quot; in the classical sense (sometimes also called &quot;libertarian&quot;), but many of them aren&#x27;t actually libertarian.<p>And, to make it even <i>more</i> confusing, there are actual libertarians in the US who don&#x27;t know to describe themselves that way[1][2].<p>1. <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/25/in-search-of-libertarians/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/25/in-search-of...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/there-are-few-libertarians-but-many-americans-have-libertarian-views/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/there-are-few-libertarian...</a>",1445544993

(The amount of Colgate they sell is proportional to the shelf space the store offers them, which is proportional to the number of varieties they offer.)  If Colgate had only one variety and Crest had ten varieties, then Crest would get that much more shelf space and vastly outsell Colgate.<p>Grocery stores also like to offer their customers the illusion of choice, while dealing with as few distributors as possible.  This simplifies their logistics.  They would prefer to sell ten varieties of Colgate and Crest than ten separate brands of toothpaste.  It gets ridiculous when you see half an aisle of Wheat Thins (original, whole wheat, low salt, spicy, plus the store clone brand of each of those).  But I suppose the nice consequence is that small corner markets can have just as good a selection, effectively, as huge superstores.",1445544910

You&#x27;ve got to remember that there are two sides to the coin: presentation and functionality. The presentation problem can be solved by web components (more accurately: the encapsulation of presentation,) but the functionality bit should be solved with proper JS APIs. That there were no proper JS APIs available 21 years ago is understandable – after all the language barely existed. But that we don&#x27;t have proper input APIs today is just silly.",1445544173

They will gain a decent network and hopefully will be already tied into an existing network. I&#x27;m a developer who has a friend who is going through the HackReactor bootcamp process and will begin this January. He&#x27;s still preparing for the training by doing self study which I mentor him on over lunch hours. A focused bootcamp paired with a solid mentor should definitely produce a developer able to deliver JR tasks. Because afterall once a person lands a job they will surely continue to learn more and more, from their tasks, their colleagues, and mentors. I say let the bootcamps thrive.",1445544057

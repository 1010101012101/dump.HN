Yeah, it's true I've never bothered learning much about anything else, but still... my opinion is somehow relevant because I have a blog.""",1210664644

What about this: <i>Emacs users need to evolve?</i>  To what?<p>There is nothing else like emacs.  Sure emacs lisp could use some help (some of us are working on adding coroutines for parallelism), but that doesn't mean it's dead.  If anything else were like emacs but better, we would all ditch it.<p>Summary: this guy is fucking clueless.  He's an IDE-wielding weenie that has only ever used Java.  Great.",1210664537

MS effectively forces businesses to upgrade Outlook every few years, and without the stick (and carrots) that MS wields, it can be a challenge to get anything new into a business.<p>But, it's true that a small company can deliver to the people who will upgrade or install new tools in ways that a large company generally cannot.  But the slow adopters are going to be slow adopters no matter who builds the application.",1210662944

W3schools' name is a little scammy, but the info they house is useful.<p>The issues w3fools cite are pretty esoteric and/or very nit-picky.

  | Browser Support. The <q> tag is supported in all major browsers, 
  | except Internet Explorer.
  This is blatantly false; <q> tags work just fine in IE8.
</code></pre>
Uh, yeah, I guess it works just fine in IE8, but it doesn't work in IE6 or IE7, both of which are called 'Internet Explorer'. So saying it doesn't work in IE is technically correct. It just could be more specific.<p>W3schools obviously fills a niche that the W3C isn't filling. Reading a spec for HTML x.x is useful, but not viable when you're trying to get stuff done.

It only gets perpetuated because people don't know exactly what they need employees to do. Life would be much easier if job listings said things like ""you need to be able to work with Python with access to other engineers for help"" or ""you need to have encyclopedic knowledge of JVM options, internals and optimizations"" instead of crap like ""Python - 2-3 years"", ""Java - 10+ years"" which don't really say anything but filter out candidates needlessly.<p>To your under/overrating problem, I think that's where ?'s have to come into play. Someone who ranks themselves very highly needs to be able to back it up, and it's your responsibility as an interviewer to get appropriate people to do that vetting if you can't. Someone who rates themselves as a 10 with Solaris, for example, needs to be vetted by the best damned sysadmin you can get. Someone who rates themselves as a 3-4 can probably be comfortably vetted by an experienced engineer.<p>I try to knock myself down roughly a point off where I think I ought to be, and I've found that works well in interviews. For instance, at my second job interview (after only a six month internship), I was asked ""on a scale of 1-10, how do you rate yourself as a software engineer?"" I replied that I rated myself a 2-3, but I considered 10 to be an engineer with a world-class reputation like Steve McConnell or Steve Yegge.

In fact, a big part of the reason that they're in academia in the first place is that they're not able to handle the mundane requirements that are usually in place in the ""real world.""<p>For example, someone I work with complains incessantly about the fact that department IT forced him to upgrade from pine — <i>pine, in 2010</i> — because it is no longer supported. If the IT folks tried to institute rigorous procedures, they would be instantly vilified (and ignored). Unlike in a company where there's a hierarchy, professors don't have anyone above giving them orders, and aren't used to the concept.<p>Of course, scientific protocols themselves often require lots of procedures, but this is very different because it comes from within and is well-motivated from the point of view of the scientist.<p>Let me clarify: I do think it is very important that what happened here doesn't happen again, but ensuring that is much harder than someone not familiar with the system might assume. It probably needs to be a mixture of carrots and sticks; I'd say a lot more carrots than sticks.",1295025803

A faculty member brought in his school paid laptop, and he obviously used it for personal reasons. This is his main work laptop with all his data (again we can't force them to follow our policy since they are not administration), so he has no backups or any antivirus scans.<p>His laptop had over 5000 viruses when I ran a virus scan. This is no joke, I have the screen shot somewhere. I refuse to clean and told him I will rebuild it. Which I did and put all this files back. I explain to him exactly what I did in an email, what he would lose (software etc) and he was okay with it, remember I have this in email. Only when he agreed did I go ahead with the rebuild.<p>He comes back and writes an email to the department chair that I had broke his laptop and had to rebuild it.

It's the motivation that makes the most sense to me.<p>That said (and again within my very limited knowledge of all this), I think that a $60+ million settlement is an incredibly good outcome for the winklevosses.  I think that if they had found a different programmer, they would have produced yet another social networking site that went nowhere.  Selling it for a tenth of their facebook settlement would have been an extraordinary outcome.<p>Why?  Because startups run by non-programming business guys who hire a string of programmers who eventually quit and leave almost never succeed on facebook's level.  Business guys like the winks greatly exaggerate the value of ""an idea"" and greatly underestimate way an idea can evolve into a new idea through implementation.  They are almost always left in the dust.<p>Let me put it this way - if I went to a brilliant programmer with an ""idea"" - even one I had done quite a bit of implementation on, and he turned it into a multi-billion dollar company and offered me $60 million, I'd consider that a really good deal.  Of course, that's not how this went down - the winks feel screwed because as far as I understand it, they kind of were. I'm basing this on the movie, so what can I say, no idea if this is true, but if I went to a programmer and he said, ""yeah, I'm working on your site, I'll get back to you"" over and over for a month, and at the end of the month he had launched a site that directly competes with the idea I thought he was working on for me, and then he told me bluntly and perhaps arrogantly that my idea was stupid and his was much better, and then used his advantage to beat me to every market, I'd be furious. I might be so furious that I'd be blinded to the truth, which is that I wouldn't have succeeded anyway.<p>I think the outcomes for the winks were<p>1) screwed and paid 60 mil

If you are selling premium content, then sure you might have to pay license fees (~10¢/user/year, and that will never go up by more than 5% every five or ten years), but why would you expect a lawsuit!?",1295024573

Considering that the use of double spaces separating sentences can provoke such ridicule, there really needs to be a global effort to educate all English speaking citizens of Earth.       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps even training centers could be erected where people could be taught this new important change to the language.              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These centers could perhaps even treat those who have been subject to the extreme psychological trauma of the public ridicule caused by the misuse of the space.",1295024558

2104234,comment,2103428,2103480,0,0,jeromec,,,"Another writing convention I read long ago which grew out of typewriter limitation is placing a comma or period within quotation marks when not part of the quotation as in:<p>I'm a fully qualified ""hacker.""<p>The period is not part of the quotation, but American writing style suggests it should still go within the quotation marks. America appears to be the only English speaking country to have this writing style; it's not that way in Britain, for example. I read this was due to something like ink splotching (or possibly it was jamming up of keys, which apparently gave us the non-optimum QWERTY layout) from where the typewriter would strike the page on mechanical typewriters when typing quickly if leaving the punctuation outside of the quotation marks as logic would dictate. I'm not sure how much truth there is to that, but I generally rebel and use the British style when writing, especially in informal situations like posting online comments.",1295024479

If you must choose one and want to do it rationally, you need a set of use cases ranked by relative importance.<p>The origin choice may be easy to change in the language syntax, but once you have users, it's not so easy.  User programs make assumptions about origin.  So does the code generation phase of the compiler.  In most cases, the assumptions are implicit and not explicit; after the fact changes are difficult.",1295024433

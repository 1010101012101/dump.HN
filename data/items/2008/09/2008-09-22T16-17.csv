Yes, we see those red solo cups of beer as a sign that someone is less mature, but let's face it, most of us have at one point before we were 21 had a red solo cup with alcohol in it - the difference is that there was no way to store/link it in a convenient way before recently.<p>Most people sweep these things under the rug.  Once they hit 30, underage drinking becomes a scourge in a way that it certainly wasn't when they were doing it.  Partying becomes the image of the lazy/unambitious rather than someone having a life.  Just look at Obama and Palin: both admit to smoking pot and both believe that pot-smokers today should be punished harshly for something they have done.<p>I think that as these things start following us around more, we're going to have to reevaluate what we deem as ""deviant"" behavior since it's going to become painfully obvious that this deviant behavior might actually be the norm.<p>OR maybe people will get better at de-tagging themselves from photos.",1222102506

To me thats a failure of a test.<p>Maybe they've fixed this bug, but here's an example.  If you have a math problem like, (substituting x for actual words)<p>x x 5 x 5 x x x<p>And your choices are 
a) 5 
b) 10
c) 15
d) 25<p>If this question is at the <i>beginning</i> of the test, its most likely the easiest solution, so pick 10.  This is because the first questions are moved to the front because they are most easily solved by the worst test takers.  These people, no matter how twisted their reasoning, most likely will come up with 10 by adding the two numbers they see, or just pick 5 because they just saw a 5<p>Towards the middle of the test you'd go with 25, because these are less likely, and necessarily wont be guessed by the dummies, but the people having reached this point will do something fancier like multiply the numbers together,<p>At the end of the test, where its hardest to reach, the answer would be 15 because you are least likely to come up with that answer.<p>This is the key to the whole hack- the answer to a difficult question cannot be accidentally guessed, otherwise, it would end up in the first questions, or just be thrown out.  You see, they couldn't determine the level of difficulty of a question by reading it, they did statistically by who got it right, and how well that person did on the overall test, so if you had a question that was answered correctly by most takers who also got most of the other questions correct, and got wrong by those who didn't do well on the rest of the test, that was a ""hard"" question.<p>When this was uncovered the testing company freaked out and the move to computers couldn't come fast enough for them (they administer these tests on computers yet?)  Its because the test can dynamically be calibrated for the test taker and you can't use the first questions, middle questions, last questions rule.",1222101323

But it appears that it creates a scaled version of what you selected based on your monitor size?<p>Would be helpful to build up a product comparison database, so that I can compare the new cellphone I am thinking about buying to my existing phone to get a real-world idea of the dimensions.<p>Suggestion for allowing people to catalog their own stuff: create a printable template that I can print out and photograph my object along with a reference item (us dollar, quarter, etc).  Between the reference item and the printed grid you should be able to work out the dimensions of the photographed object.  You could probably get a massive social effect from people photographing and cataloging their various objects.",1222099205

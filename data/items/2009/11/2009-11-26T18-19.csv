On the assumption that we're defining socialism as ""everything Stalin, Kim Jong Il, and Ceausescu did"", I'll take a similar tack in the opposite direction and contend that capitalism is responsible for the American incursion into Vietnam, Watergate, and Abu Ghraib (since they were all carried out by a capitalist country).<p>A couple of possible counterarguments to this would be (1) that individuals, not capitalism itself, are responsible for these events, and (2) that America isn't really capitalist and theory shows that they wouldn't happen in a truly capitalist country.<p>Note that both of these counterarguments are the same as the ones used by the proponents of socialism, Marxism, etc., with the difference that ""America"" is replaced with ""the USSR/Cuba/North Korea"".<p>There are good arguments to be made against socialism and similar policies.

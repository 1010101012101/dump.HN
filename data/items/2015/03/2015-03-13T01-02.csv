They finally wrote some for ES and then finally started backporting them to OpenGL.<p>Worse, they rarely check the limits, only the basics. They also they didn&#x27;t check anything related to multiple contexts. The point being the drivers are/were full of bugs on the edge cases.<p>Testing works. If there were tests that were relatively comprehensive and that rejected drivers that failed the edge cases they&#x27;d gone a long way to mitigating these issues because the dev&#x27;s apps wouldn&#x27;t have worked.<p>There&#x27;s also just poor api design. Maybe poor is a strong word. Example, uniform locations are ints so some apps assume they&#x27;ll be assigned in order then fail when they get to a machine where they&#x27;re not. Another example, you&#x27;re allowed to make up resource ids. OpenGL does not require you to call `glCreateXXX` just call `glBindXXX` with any id you please. But of course if you do that maybe some id you use is already being used for something else. So id=1 works on some driver but not some other.<p>I&#x27;m excited about Vulkan but I&#x27;m a little worried it&#x27;s actually going to make the driver bug issues worse. If using it in a spec compliant way is even harder than OpenGL and your app just happens to work on certain drivers other driver vendors will again be forced to implement workarounds.",1426210591

An outlier, in other words.  Generally in a setting like the Emergency Department, which is where I developed products for 7 years, the docs only describe 20-30 meds 90% of the time.  Other specialties, like pain medicine, are similar.  For those we build a pre-selected set of favorite meds that they could just click.<p>The doc would say the pharmacist is not being restrictive enough because the doc has to wade through so many permutations of what is medically the same med, or has to sift through medication forms that he/she has no use for.<p>From the pharmacist&#x27;s perspective I want a _complete_ database so I can record with very granular accuracy what the order was.  Also, the pharmacy database has things like ingredients in it which it factors into allergy and interaction checking.<p>I agree with your other points, though.  Free text entry is faster - especially if you have voice recognition.<p>The way to design med lookups, in my opinion, is to have a dropdown for the pharmaceutical substance the physician wants, then the dose, then an optional drop-down for the form (tab, injection, suppository, whatever).<p>A suitable medication form would need to be found between what&#x27;s medically indicated, what the pharmacist is okay with, and what the hospital has in stock - ideally in a dispensing machine at the point of care.",1426210274

(2) The study survey was carried out by a local North Carolina polling agency with no data available as far as I can tell.

9195190,comment,9192628,9194200,0,0,ertdfgcb,,,"To expand on Magic being &quot;hackable&quot;: The game is this way because every rule of the game can be changed by a card. There are no set in stone rules in the sense that they will always apply the same way no matter the gamestate - there are cards that say &quot;You can&#x27;t win the game&quot; or &quot;End the turn&quot;, &quot;Skip the upkeep phase&quot;, etc. The game isn&#x27;t just about playing by the rules effectively, it&#x27;s also about changing the rules effectively and dealing with how your opponent is doing the same. I think a related reason the game exploded is the fact that design (deckbuilding) is an integral part. Having a hackable game is great, but if the hackableness is random it&#x27;s not that exciting. It&#x27;s when you can design an exploit (deck) and improve on it that it gets really exciting.<p>To me, the main reason Magic is fun is the variety of skills and approaches it encourages. You can play it as several different resource management games: there are at least 4 important resources to manage (time, mana, cards, life) and you can win by focus on getting one or more of these resources more or by preventing your opponent from having/using any resources, and all of those decisions have major impacts on your play and deckbuilding style. You can also play it as a game of assembling your crazy exploit of the rules fast enough to win (combo decks), or you might even be able to exploit the rules so hard you&#x27;re essentially playing a different game from your opponent, so you have a completely different win condition to achieve (legacy Dredge).",1426209962

The platform is built on top of Amazon Web Services and utilizes Docker to provide users with a sysops-free way to manage complex database and application architectures.<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Relocation assistance, if you want to move to NYC.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f72d1f9/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f...</a>",1426209767

If you&#x27;ve got a new startup and you want to match Uber&#x27;s response time, you don&#x27;t need to have nearly as many drivers as Uber, because you will initially be be serving a small number of customers in a geographically restricted area (if you&#x27;re smart). Your first customers may actually get better response times than Uber, merely by having a higher initial ratio of drivers to riders. So once you&#x27;ve got that toehold, you can grow your service gradually, while maintaining the same response times that Uber does.<p>It&#x27;s true that Uber could try to run promotions to starve competitors, but could Uber keep this up forever when it&#x27;s so easy to compete? They have deep pockets, but not infinitely deep.<p>EDIT:<p>On second thought, your point about Uberpool is more compelling. Whoever has the higher density of riders in a given area will be able to do pooling better (although with diminishing returns as density increases past a certain point), and this could be hard for a newcomer to match. On the other hand, if you can reach that threshold by competing on non-pooled service, you may be able to roll out a competing pooling service later. It seems more surmountable than competing with Airbnb, because you could start by targeting a small geographic area, but I can see this driving some of Uber and Lyft&#x27;s valuation.<p>Thankfully, newcomers will always be able to compete on price with regular (non-pooled) taxi service, so we can expect those prices to stay low, effectively setting a ceiling on pooling prices.",1426209112

Microsoft gave a lot of insight about the hard it was to get Direct2D to be competitive with GDI/GDI+.<p>If you do see any performance benefits it likely will be because you support less features than what a modern day browser supports with HTML/CSS.  But in my opinion you could probably achieve faster speeds with Canvas in a similar manner.",1426208681

But, we happened to be roaming the conference area, and some guy, wearing a tshirt and MC Hammer pants, was at a booth selling these cards in a plastic container.  It was a new game, he said.  Magic.  He gave us a bunch of cards for free and some rule books.<p>We ended up playing all night.  We liked it so much that the next morning we bought the rest of his plastic containers.  They were filled with cards of all types.  These ended up being all &#x27;alpha&#x27; cards.  Little did we know, we were stacked with Moxes, Black Lotuses, etc.  As a group, we must have had dozens of them.<p>We had no idea that they&#x27;d be worth anything.  And, neither did Wizards of the Coast.  The original rules stated that you had to ante a card out of your deck, just to play!",1426208652

Ergo, there is no real social mobility because you need a certain type of parent to ensure you don&#x27;t have student debt that leaves you in the red even with a high tech job.<p>The valley and SF just rich kids getting richer while screwing over everyone else.",1426208485

Basically you have the same properties using a single node without consensus, if not for the data redundancy. However it is not something like: one node dies, the other can continue.

The CMS directory could be locked using HTTP auth (implemented by the HTTP server); this way, not every little CMS bug would allow the world to compromise the whole server.<p>Do we really expect every parish choir with a web site to hire a CMS specialist who installs updates within hours of the release and fixes all compatibility quirks that occur with new major releases? This is an unworldly approach that bestows thousands of zombie machines on us.<p>And what happens if the CMS for some old site stops being maintained? A responsible admin would shut the site down, resulting in a loss of potentially valuable information. This issue would be solved by using static HTML export, too.<p>Are there any well-maintained open-source CMS out there where static HTML export is an integral part of the architecture, ideally with good usability and written in PHP (not that I like the language, but that&#x27;s what is available everywhere)? (I&#x27;m not talking about command line static site generators without a user-friendly backend - those are only an option for techies.)",1414623126

The 3d scanning stuff is a neat addition on top of that, but a much more niche use case.<p>e.g. My colleague writes a document and emails it to me. I open it, print it out, and bring it to Sprout, placing it on the capacitive mat. As I&#x27;m reading it, I&#x27;m annotating it with pen on paper. Sprout tracks my annotations, digitizes them, and adds them as a digital layer to the original document.<p>While I&#x27;m annotating, my colleague joins the &quot;session&quot; and wants to make more changes and incorporate some of my suggestions. I see that notification, chuck away my piece of paper, and have Sprout project the digital document onto the capacitive pad. While I watch, my colleague makes changes which are live-updated to my document. I see her copy my hand-written notes which have been digitised and OCR&#x27;d. She takes my notes, changes the font, and sticks them into one of the paragraphs. Likewise, I can use the stylus to make more annotations that my colleague sees in real-time, or, since the document is digital this time around, I can just edit the paragraphs directly too.<p>Think Google Wave + Collusion for iPad + the ability to do fairly seamlessly with both digital and physical documents.",1414622904

There are many different ways in which a gratuity can be added. American Express does not define any specific methods for adding gratuities...&quot; it further goes on to say &quot;American Express\nrecommends that Terminal software enables the Cardmember to\nadd the gratuity amount to the transaction before entering his or her PIN.

If there was only one compiler, or one best compiler, we would cite this in CS papers. In fact, &quot;David A. Wheeler&#x27;s sloccount&quot; is commonly cited in CS papers, as well as Weka, LLVM&#x27;s Klee, and Z3.<p>On the other hand, nobody cites Djikstra&#x27;s algorithm, or optimizing compilers, because those are considered foundational and have not changed in a long time. If BLAST was never supplanted, it would eventually not be cited because that would simply be how sequencing was done. But since it represents a new practice, citing it is necessary to place your work in the context of other work.<p>I don&#x27;t see how you can say that BLAST or Klee were not scientifically impactful -- being the force multiplier that enables other avenues of research is possibly the most valuable thing a scientist can do. For example, should a paper that proves P!=NP become instantly the most cited paper in computer science? Though the question is one of the most deep open problems in the field, it isn&#x27;t relevant at a lot of levels of study, and so it probably wouldn&#x27;t ever become more cited than Klee.<p>Further still, I&#x27;d guess that the top 1% of cited papers are mostly methods papers, as the article bears out. The next tier are the top-notch findings papers that you mention, because they spark other research. The C45 paper probably doesn&#x27;t have as much cites as Weka, because Weka is relevant beyond C45, but it certainly has more cites than a less-meaningful machine learning paper.<p>To carry all of this back to a software project, software projects in their Readme.md always cite their language (like a key method), always cite their dependent libraries (like specific methods used in that work), but never cite things like binary search (a foundational finding). A project MIGHT cite a compiler if that compiler is the only compiler that compiles it! In that case the compiler is not a commodity, and thus worth citing. Version control and editing are totally orthogonal to the actual software, unless you&#x27;re working in a visual language or something, in which case you would in fact cite your IDE.",1414622221

Instead, the internal CPU microcode itself ran a little loop without dispatching any machine instructions until the tentacles that reached out from that loop were tickled by an external interrupting event.  That loop had to be very short for latency reasons and very prickly to test for all the conditions that could take the processor out of it to resume dispatching instructions or do critical internal things.<p>I know this because I wrote that 6 (initially 8) micro-instruction loop for the IBM System/370 Model 155-157 in the late &#x27;60s.

Even something as simple as the HTML5 doctype isn&#x27;t a valid SGML doctype expected by HTML 4 browsers.  It is a hack which just happens to produce the correct results on older browsers.<p>Javascript used to have to be placed in HTML comments so that old browsers wouldn&#x27;t display the source code as content because the earliest browsers had no concept of client side scripting.<p>Obviously a frozen platform is better to work on -- that&#x27;s why people continually suggest such things for HTML.

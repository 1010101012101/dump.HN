852030,comment,851831,851894,0,0,iigs,,,"Did they suggest those in a particular order?<p>I would consider reversing the order of those from a desirability standpoint, particlularly if the throttle is forced wide open (as opposed to partially). Most of the time the rev limiter will prevent any damage (and who cares if it doesn't, even a $3000 engine is less than a night at the hospital). IMO the car isn't even a thing to consider saving.<p>If it fails to switch into neutral while the engine is loaded, turning the key one click in the off direction will unload the tension in the driveline and possibly give it what it needs to shift to neutral (electric shifting transmissions might only benefit from the first few milliseconds after reapplying power). Then you can turn the key back on.<p>The ""dig at it with your toes"" solution is worth a shot if you have the time, or if it's only revving slightly above the desired level. I would be afraid that it would take concentration away from the primary objective (keeping the car pointed away from cars and fixed objects).",1254293003

851997,comment,851878,851878,0,0,harpastum,,,"The big problem I see here is that longer comments are much more likely to include quotes and other contextual information that makes them seem 'better' compared to shorter comments. The author mentions this, but underestimates its importance.<p>For example, using HN karma as an approximate value, I left a one-line comment [1] that seems uninteresting by itself, but added significant information to the discussion, compared to another comment [2] that is very long. The thing is, it's just a gigantic quote. I think that these two cases are the norm, not outliers.<p>On the other hand, I think it would be very interesting (and more accurate) to compare comment length and karma value on HN.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=830887"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=830887</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=814591"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=814591</a>",1254291025

You'll be losing a large amount of traffic to the .com owner)<p>2) Yet another online storage service. Xdrive, Mozy... we have many of those around<p>But they really execute their plan very well and differentiate themselves from the competition with their clean and easy-to-use interface.

300398,comment,300174,300174,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"I really didn't get this rant. The author seems to believe (without any convincing reason) that in order to understand a program you have to understand it's data structures which must be typed and set in stone.<p>I read the article he's bashing and I thought the code was nicely written and quite an enjoyable read. It certainly wasn't that hard to understand.<p>Answering his points in brief:<p>>No complete declarations of complete types, even though it would be (kind of) possible with JavaScript. So I can't start by visualizing the data structures.<p>Type declarations are not mandatory to understand code.<p>>No type declarations, but lots of confusing variable names, so I'm constantly going back trying to figure out what's what.<p>The variable names are reasonable (symbol_table, scope, expression, etc). The most confusing were ""nud"" and ""led"" but those were explained in detail later (""null denotation"" and ""left denotation"" - used for binding operators during precedence).<p>>Dynamic modification of fields in objects. For example the function advance() adds the field arity to the token object, which was not declared anywhere, so you only find out about this by reading this function. This goes against everything sane in programming.<p>Goes against everything ""sane"" in programming? It's just something the author isn't used to. It's perfectly valid programming technique and I've used it in python.<p>>Going completely overboard, the field arity is used to store whether a token is a ""name"", ""literal"" or ""operator"" but later, for operators, changes this field to ""unary"", ""binary"", etc. (Truly bad programming, but not related to my argument about typing.)<p>I can't make any sense of this rant.<p>>To deliver the final blow to understandability, in functional style, the member functions of the objects are dynamically added and modified. At this point, if I see an object, I don't know its ""type"", but even if somebody tells me that, I don't know what state that ""type"" is in: what the data fields are, what they are used for and what the member functions do.<p>I get the feeling this guy just has a mental block about the way programs should be (C++/Java yay! Anthing else - boo!) and is unwilling/underexposed to other programming paradigms.<p>>Given the cognitive difficulties above, how does one look over the code to verify that it's correct? It's hard enough with static languages, here it seems quixotic. How about finding bugs?<p>The same as with typed languages except that the compiler doesn't do one level of verification for you.",1221057662

They get upfront cash but since these actions hurt the business, it hurts cashflow in the future. So it's not like as if they got off scot-free with this strategy. Like I said, DCF requires that you have really good estimates about future cashflows. If you say <i>But you don't see it!</i>, then you are not making good estimates.<p>Note: My point is not that DCF will give you a 99.99% accurate valuation. No model will since all models depends on the accuracy of the inputs. My point is that given the amount of knowledge you have about a particular company, the DCF model provides the best framework to reaching a fair valuation.<p><i>A company with a few long-lived assets, like an airline with just a couple planes, will show low earnings and high cash flow when it's not replacing a plane. This is one of those situations in which high cash flow is deceptive and earnings are not.</i><p>It is not deceptive. If the company does that, you just assume their future cashflow from operations will decline from the aging planes.<p>While other valuation models are useful in supporting your initial valuation calculations, DCF is the fundamental block.",1221055801

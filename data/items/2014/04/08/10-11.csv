They don&#x27;t really improve on the existing semantics.<p>What bugs me is the implicitness of __in__ defaulting to keys for a mapping. We have .keys() and .values() which are nice and clear since they explicitly grab an object which has an unambiguous definition for __in__.<p>Double Edit: It&#x27;s an implementation decision that had to be made and I&#x27;m not aware of the rationale or debate behind the original choice. It&#x27;s directly attributable to the decision to make __iter__ return the keys for a mapping which is the root of my issue. It&#x27;s presumably useful and convenient (from a language writer&#x27;s perspective) for iteration of a mapping to be along the keys in whatever order they may be traversed but if that&#x27;s all it comes down to, why should a mapping be iterable at all when there is obvious ambiguity in what may be iterated? Maybe there is some history I&#x27;m not aware of where the .keys(), .values() and .items() methods were introduced post-hoc and the previous behaviour was such due to their non-existence and the need to iterate and then index to get all values in the object.",1396954317

I happened upon the newly minted spamassassin project, made it work to my liking, sent in a few patches and never looked back. Now, many years later, I still run SA in combination with Exim and Dovecot, filing unrecognised spam into a &#x27;SPAM-it&#x27; folder from where it is picked up every night to train the bayes filter. Everything which is &#x27;definitely&#x27; spam is refused at the gate, everything which is most certainly spam is filed in a spam folder which is out of sight and mostly out of mind, everything which is probably spam is automatically dumped in the aforementioned &#x27;SPAM-it&#x27; folder (with autolearning disabled to avoid erroneous positive feedback). There is a &#x27;HAM-it&#x27; folder to tell the filter about mail I care about as well as a &#x27;FORGET-it&#x27; folder to untrain the filter on given messages. I use sieve to file messages in their designated folders.<p>No other filtering is applied, no greylisting, no country blocks (I need to be able to communicate with people all over the world), no fail2ban, no nothin&#x27;. By keeping the filtering concentrated in one spot I avoid the trap of turning the mail system into a Rube Goldberg machine loaded with unintended consequences.<p>On average, one or two spammy messages make it through the portcullis per day. I simply dump them in the &#x27;SPAM-it&#x27; folder and forget about them. False positives are exceedingly rare, fortunately. On the whole I consider my mail setup to be functional and above all manageable.<p>Everything needed to implement this is available in Debian.

Using .* then as the elementwise version works.<p>I&#x27;d have personally preferred to see Python do type testing on the variables - it already does. For example:<p>&#x27;quick&#x27; + &#x27;fox&#x27; = &#x27;quickfox&#x27;\n3 + 5 = 8\n[3] + [5] = [3,5]<p>So why not make it a case where * on an int or float does the &#x27;standard&#x27; multiplication that already exists whereas * on an array does matrix multiplication?<p>You arrive at the problem of then not having an element-wise version of the multiplication but it&#x27;s not as if this solves that problem anyway.<p>What am I missing to make that a problem?",1396953465

Adium OTR plugin sends encrypted messages, but identities of Alice and Bob are in the clear to NSA.<p>Bitmessage does not do any OTR tricks (I myself do not think OTR is very important), but guarantees anonymous routing probably even better than Tor: every message is routed to everyone randomly without any particular route whatsoever. In addition, protocol can be extended to wrap messages with some random person&#x27;s key, so you get double-clouded routing.<p>So, Bitmessage might give you even better tangible privacy over Tor, while not giving any of disputable value of OTR.<p>PS. Why I think OTR is of little value.<p>OTR is a trick Alice uses to release signing keys after talking to Bob. Bob can retain the info on his disk and be interrogated, but Alice sort of &quot;proves&quot; that anyone could produce that data, so she&#x27;s innocent. In other words, OTR is not about hiding any information, but about telling the court that &quot;i was smart, you can&#x27;t prove it was written by me&quot;. Logically OTR makes sense, but without being tested in court (which is not a department of logic) it&#x27;s worthless. And I believe, when it comes to a trial, your adversaries will have plenty of parallel construction in addition to judge&#x27;s &quot;common sense&quot; to invalidate any trickery that your might have employed. In other words: if you talked to Bob and his data is taken by NSA, you are doomed, with or without OTR.<p>EDIT: I meant &quot;deniability&quot; part of OTR. &quot;Perfect forward secrecy&quot; is indeed valuable, but not implemented yet.",1396952467

In others, it is a genuine fragmentation of a big business into many units. Independent contractors can benefit from this and the whole system can become more efficient.<p>If a new technology is involved, the latter is more likely. Technology can reduce transaction costs and replace firms with markets made up of smaller firms.<p>A really interesting and accessible (but usually misinterpreted via soundbite) famous work in economics is &#x27; The Nature of the Firm&#x27; by Ronald Coase. I think this is the best framework for understanding the key dynamic here. Whether employees or independent &quot;contractors&quot; make economic sense is most influenced by transaction costs.<p>For example if the cost of hiring, negotiating and communicating with a graphic designer every time was low enough, there would be no reason for a company to hire a graphic designer. But realistically if you add up all the things an in house designer does (including making the decisions about what needs to be done) in a month and try to get those done by freelancers, I would estimate the cost at 3-4X higher. As things stand now, I think that a company contracting over 10-20 hrs per week of design work is probably better off with a full time employee. The main reason is transaction costs.<p>Technology can cause big changes in transaction costs. What was previously done by companies can be done by markets.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm</a>",1396951914

7552436,comment,7549028,7549780,1,0,vidarh,,,"I learned symbolic differentiation by reading a book about Prolog that used some of the rules as an example and translating it into Pascal (I didn&#x27;t have a Prolog interpreter) and then adding additional rules from my maths textbook. I then figured out operator precedence parsing because I got annoyed at having to manually translate the math to something the rules engine could handle.<p>To this day, my preferred way of understanding maths is by looking at implementations of the algorithms - I find mathematical notation and every maths textbook I&#x27;ve seen to be extremely tedious and overcomplicated compared to code (of course with the caveat that at least some of this is because I&#x27;ve spent far more time learning to understand programming, though I still found that route easier when I was in school)",1396951596

Roundcube, via managesieve, can filter on <i>anything</i> in an email message -- any header, any other attribute of an email message you can think of should be doable.<p>Gmail also gives you a useful but limited set of actions for matching messages: archival, applying labels, starring, marking as read, forwarding, deleting. managesieve gives you a lot more options, and possibly one of the nicer ones is the ability to auto-reply to specific messages with a specific other message. My managesieve prefs currently has, &quot;Move message to&quot;, &quot;Copy message to&quot;, &quot;Redirect message to&quot;, &quot;Send message copy to&quot;, &quot;Discard with message&quot;, &quot;Reply with messsage&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, &quot;Set flags&quot;, &quot;Add flags&quot;, &quot;Remove flags&quot;, &quot;Send notification&quot;, etc.<p>Filters was for me the killer feature that moved me from Gmail to Roundcube years ago.",1396951588

I wanted to schedule a drop off for the boxes but they were booked that week. Problem was I was flying back to Europe that week and so really needed them to bring the boxes. They were very flexible and got someone to drop the boxes off before they made the usual rounds. Same for picking up the boxes a few days later. Definitely can recommend them!",1396951551

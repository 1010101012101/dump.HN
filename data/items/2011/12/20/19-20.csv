3374781,comment,3373672,3374195,6,0,exDM69,,,"I am a recovering object oriented programmer. For years I drank the OOP kool aid and I used to think in terms of classes, objects and design patterns and I sang the ""everything is an object"" mantra. What changed my mind was two things: type classes (in Haskell) and duck typing (in Python and JavaScript). Now my (unpopular) opinion is that object oriented programming is just a passing fad in programming, but it's one that has gone on for too long and done immense damage to the brains of programmers as well as software engineering in general.<p>A major theoretical issue with object oriented programming is that it's not based on any theory, but it's a ad hoc construction without any proofs or axioms that can be reasoned about. There are some loose principles like the Liskov Substitution Principle, but they're not really any kind of formal theory.<p>As I was writing OO code, I started noticing a pattern. The first was that a vast majority of the classes I wrote were practically a boilerplate-heavy way of doing partial application of functions. The second was that I almost never  used plain vanilla inheritance (Cat extends Mammal extends Animal) but almost every time I used inheritance, it was only to build some design pattern used to fit a square peg into a round hole. The rest of the cases where I used inheritance were mostly implementing some kind of sum types or algebraic data types.<p>In dynamically typed languages, single dispatch method calls and inheritance adds very little to the language. JavaScript  works just fine without classes or inheritance. Extending or composing objects works simply by adding or overwriting object members. Multiple dispatch methods (in e.g. Python) use the type of an object as metadata to select the correct implementation, but using type information directly is usually frowned upon as it's a bad fit with duck typing. It's way easier to just add the required metadata to the object and not rely on run-time typing information, and it's still prettier than using Visitor pattern for multiple dispatch. (Clojure's multiple dispatch is pretty sweet btw)<p>In statically typed languages, the problem is that most popular programming languages have a really crappy typing system. C-style typing is very limited but for some reason the typing system in most popular programming languages (Java, C#) is based on C's type system with a virtual function dispatch table bolted on. Add a little syntactic sugar and you've got OOP.<p>There's a whole world out there in more powerful and interesting typing systems. Haskell has a very practical typing system, with algebraic data types / sum types for ""static polymorphism"" (A finite amount of types, somewhat equivalent to the limits of Visitor pattern) and type classes for ""dynamic polymorphism"" where new types (that implement the same interface) may be added after the initial definition.<p>Basically any OOP pattern can be pretty easily reproduced in Haskell's typing discipline. However, that is often not the best solution since there are more powerful tools available. E.g. compare a factory pattern to Haskell's Read class.<p>Once I unlearned OOP, I felt liberated from a bunch of stupid restrictions and ideologies that should dictate what my code looks like. Programming is fun again.",1324409818

It's a good one.<p>The quote from the film, in the context of having watched it, describes, with great brevity that actions such as the one being discussed in this thread can actually have negative results.  The permutations are many and complex.  I'll go over a few:<p>1- Don't file patents.\nAs someone said.  Google tried this.  Didn't work.<p>2- Don't sue.\nLot's of companies take this approach.  I can probably imagine that a company like IBM has so much covered that they could have a whole department doing nothing but suing other companies.  They don't seem to be in that business.\nThen again, companies like Google have tried to remain outside the fray and, ultimately, had to invest in a $12 billion dollar arsenal to have some protection.  Twelve billion dollars.  So much wasted.<p>3- We all have patents and we all sue.  Global Thermonuclear Patent War (GTPW):  I sue you for everything I can and you counter-sue me with all you got.  We go at it for years.  I win sometimes and so do you.  We burn through tons of cash that could have been used for far more productive pursuits.  Progress slows.  Nobody wins.  Some loose in monumental ways.<p>4- Innovators with great ideas and drive become afraid of getting anywhere close to the GTPW and instead choose to focus their efforts elsewhere or simply abandon the field.<p>5- The GTPW is fueled by the failure of the patent system and ignorant politicians to do the right thing.  Patents (the weapons of war) are granted to all participants at an ever-increasing rate.  The wars escalate and, very soon, it is quite literally impossible to innovate.  Attempting to innovate means to create an exposure to litigation and becoming embroiled in your own GTPW.<p>6- Investors begin to pull back because new ventures --and the money that went into them-- can evaporate in a microsecond if they even skirt the edges of the GTPW.<p>7- The Chinese don't give a crap about any of this so, while we are all engulfed in GTPW they continue to copy, learn, grow, experiment, build, invest, innovate and advance.  Check mate.<p>8- Western political systems can't get out of its own way to save our own lives, so the situation continues to escalate until there's total meltdown --at which point it is too late.<p>9- Even in the face of having the gun to our own heads and the trigger partially pulled the western world refuses to act as the adults in the room and we continue, little by little, to pull the triggers that will ultimately destroy our way of life for decades, if not generations.<p>Then comes the realization:\n""Strange game. The only winning move is not to play.""<p>So, you can see now that this short little quote from a geek movie actually is very relevant and excels at summarizing a wide range of scenarios that I've only glanced at.  The failures of the patent system and what companies are doing to each other is but one of a myriad of problems created by incompetent governments around the world.<p>AT&T just had to spend three billion dollars because the government did not want to let it buy T-Mobile.  Three billion dollars.  What you hear is the huge sucking sound of innovation, jobs and growth leaving the room.<p>Someone, somewhere, somehow has to take a really good look at what is going on in the western world and start fixing problems right now.  The path we are on leads to absolutely nothing that is good.  In many ways it might already be too late.",1324409072

3374694,comment,3372407,3372407,2,0,jashmenn,,,"imo it depends largely on your co-workers / environment. For instance, where I work (bigco) there is no way a large number of OO-java programmers are going to switch to a functional language like clojure. However, there is a chance that OO-java programmers will switch to scala because the mental models can be similar enough when you're first getting started. That is, you technically can program java-like scala because you have objects, strong-types, assignable variables, etc. So while scala has powerful language features available, the barrier-to-entry is lower (for a ""regular"" OO-java guy).<p>With clojure, on the other hand, if you haven't done ""functional"" programming at a large scale you literally have to relearn ""how"" to program. You don't have state, you can't assign variables, you only sort-of have objects, and there are all these funny parenthesis all over the place.<p>So first ask yourself the question ""who are you going to be programming with"" and ""what do you want to learn"".<p>I've written and deployed non-trivial production systems in both and I'm fond of saying that scala drove me to clojure. I'm not trying to start a flame-war or anything [1], so let's start with the good stuff:<p>* you get functional constructs & concise iterators<p>* ruby-like mixin functionality is awesome (implicits) - this allows you to architect using composition over inheritance which is a huge win over java imo.<p>But...<p>* the syntax of scala can get quite perlish at times (my favorite being the ""crying-kissy-face-operator"" :_*  [2]).<p>* the strong typing can be maddening. For instance, if you're trying to use two different JSON libraries (as in early days of Lift) you have to do all sorts of ugly type conversions. This leads to type boxing and...<p>* For ""nothingness"" tests you have: Null, null, Nil, Nothing, None, and Unit. Fun. [3]<p>* inline-xml (who asked for this?)<p>It was when slogging through a Lift-based recommendation system that I discovered clojure and I have to say, I love clojure. You can program in a lisp but still use the gobs of java libraries available. The syntax is straightforward, the performance is good/acceptable, and because it's on the jvm you can use it in Hadoop etc.<p>So while it <i>does</i> take longer for an OOP-minded person to think in more functional terms, I think you'll find that learning a lisp will make you a better OO programmer.<p>* [1] I have <i>tons</i> of smart friends who love scala. I like scala better than java, but if I had my pick, I'd pick clojure over scala.

People coming from a background in, say, C++ or Java will naturally have preconceptions about what these words mean, and will almost inevitably start by trying to apply them in Haskell world where they don't work.<p>It is particularly unfortunate because, with the wisdom of hindsight, I think classes as used in C++ and Java have been responsible for many problems over the years. This is fundamentally because they take two very common, very useful ideas -- modular design (separation of interface and implementation) and compound data types (struct/record/variant/etc.) -- and try to use a single tool to implement both at the same time.<p>Unfortunately, that creates all kinds of presumptions about how you write your functions, where the emphasis is always on one object being paramount or one data type controlling everything. For practical programming tasks, it may be more useful to model a situation using a set of related types to hold the data and a set of algorithms defined in terms of one <i>or more</i> of those data types (or more generally <i>collections</i> of one or more such types) to manipulate that data.<p>It's probably not an exaggeration to say that almost all of the most common modelling problems with C++/Java style OOP -- the ""diamond pattern"" with multiple inheritance, for example -- are due at least in part to this unwarranted emphasis on this/self/whatever you want to call it. Much of the rest is due to over-use of inheritance, which again has an underlying subclass-or-subtype ambiguity in what it represents -- and which again is perhaps emphasized by the whole one-object-to-rule-the-world philosophy even when what OOP would call containment or aggregation is a clearer way to model the situation.<p>Languages such as Haskell have never had this history of conflating modular design with structuring data, nor the resulting false friend of emphasizing one object/value/whatever in any given modelling context. IME, this is the big conceptual leap that is sometimes hard for those with a strongly everything-is-an-object background to make, though it's perhaps a little easier these days for anyone who has used C++ templates or Java generics. Once you make the jump, type classes and algebraic data types make a lot more sense.",1324407610

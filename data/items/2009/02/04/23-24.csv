The error of logic made by the islanders consisted of mistaking a necessary condition (i.e., building airstrips, control towers, etc.) for cargo to come flying in, for a sufficient condition for cargo to come flying in, thereby reversing the causation. On a lower level, they repeated the same error by e.g. mistaking the necessary condition (i.e. build something that looks like a control tower) for building a control tower, for a sufficient condition for building a control tower.",1233791925

I'm the creator of Open Source Food and today I have an exciting announcement to make.<p>Open Source Food was launched as a personal project in March 2007 and has grown from a little recipe site inhabited by me and my friends, to a popular social network for foodies where thousands of people browse a beautifully-photographed collection of thousands of recipes every day.<p>I started Open Source Food at the same time as I started experimenting with cooking and I can honestly say that without a doubt, my cooking skills have improved by being constantly inspired by the OSF community and my friends on there. It has been a most wonderful and delicious journey :)<p>My intention with managing OSF was always to grow it into something big, bright and beautiful. Even if that meant I could no longer handle everything by myself. I have huge aspirations for the OSF community and I think that the time has come where you all deserve more attention and more resources than I can offer alone!<p>That is why I am pleased to announce that from today, OSF will be owned and operated by Tsavo Media who will be integrating it into the Daymix network (www.daymix.com). Don't worry, they aren't some big, grey corporation - they are a group of highly talented people, and I have friends there. OSF is in good hands.<p>I'm not going anywhere though. Remember - I still like cooking and eating :) I'm still going to be on the site, posting my recipes and writing comments as usual. I'm also going to be staying around to help take OSF to the next level, and with that will come some changes to the site, which I'll tell you about now.<p>Tsavo are smart folks and they see the huge potential in the site but we both agree that the name might be holding us back a bit. Open Source Food... It's a little too ""techy"" - even a little bit cold, when you consider how bright and beautiful the community is. For that reason we will be changing the name. Same great site, same great community - but new name and brand new horizons.<p>The new name will be... www.nibbledish.com!<p>I think it's cute. I like it.<p>The name change will not affect service. The transition will happen in the background and one day when you visit the site you will simply be forwarded to the new name automatically - we anticipate this will happen within the next few days. This means it is business as usual, so don't stop posting recipes!<p>Thank you to all of you for coming together and creating this community. I thank you for your continuing support of me, the Tsavo team and the rest of the Daymix network as we launch nibbledish and take it to new heights!<p>Happy Eating,\nJon Yongfook Cockle",1233789505

If the people at the top can't manipulate their own salaries, or their interests are aligned with the long term interests of the company, then you might get good outcomes</i><p>So, assuming for a moment that no taxes just affects corporations, if corporate executives can't manipulate their salaries that's good, because why? Because the extra money would go to shareholders instead of just one schmuck?<p>How much money do you think the average CEO of a company with less than 50 employees makes? I'll give you a hint: these guys aren't riding around in $50 Million jets. And at that level, for every buck you pull out of the biz for your salary, that's one less dollar to fund the money machine. A lot of the startup essays and books talk about that, it's basic startup economics. When young and growing, take as little away from the business as possible.<p>If I have 100,000 CEOs with an average extra $5K to spend next year, doesn't that stimulate the economy? And that's assuming they took the money out. In reality, for those companies to be where they are, most all of any extra money is going towards growth: jobs, products, marketing, media, etc. Let's not forget that for them to have any extra corporate money at all, <i>they have to have earned it</i>. It's not like it appears by magic. That means they already know how to make money given the right resources. It's their money really, not ours. Why not let the engine run a little faster? Wouldn't that create more jobs in more diverse industries? Jobs that were based on sound, proven business models? What kind of job is based on a one-time government expenditure? Sounds like a job where it goes away once the money runs out. The other guy, the guy that got the job at the growing company, he's hooked into an already-increasing slot that's proven to work during a recession: it only gets better with time.",1233789421

For instance, low taxes means more corporate profits, and in many corporations, rational behavior for the people at the top is to take that profit as salary and bonuses.  Real corporations aren't supernatural investment machines.  They're just groups of people.  If the people at the top can't manipulate their own salaries, or their interests are aligned with the long term interests of the company, then you might get good outcomes, but in general you have the same guarantee that you do with the government - none.",1233788827

I ended up calling my friends and talking to them instead of writing stupid wall posts.  I felt so self-aware of my free time that I actually started exercising more. I didn't have to fear that I would get in trouble at work for not working, nor did I have to delete inappropriate tags/pictures/comments.  AND because I wasn't stalking anyone, I actually developed a healthy relationship with my ex.<p>I came back to Facebook though...eventually. My friends cried foul. I gave in. But as my social groups dissociate and morph, I'm feeling the need to leave again.  Some things in life are just better off forgetting.  You keep in touch with the friends you want to see and those that make an actual effort back.  Poking doesn't cut it.<p>Thats how life should be lived.  I want it back.",1233788550

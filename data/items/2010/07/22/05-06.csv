Here are a couple key thoughts:<p>* Adwords are great, but spending money before you know what kind of conversion you are able to get from natural SEO isn't a good idea.  You can always buy traffic, make sure you have the right funnel first - image it is a pipe you are trying to make as wide and friction-free as possible.  I think Adwords works great if you are selling a product similar to something already in the market<p>* forums, blogs, etc. have a very short lifespan so you should expect you will get peaks from high buzz items (like a post doing well here on HN) and it will trail off after that, if you can retain 5-10% that's great.  You have to consistently crank out new relevant content.<p><i>",1279778372

Thankfully 2 acquisition offers came in which became more distracting and resulted in a happy exit. From the moment the cease and desist notice was hand delivered up until we sold the business almost all work on the product stopped.<p>I tell myself these days that legal wranglings are simply a cost of doing business, but unless you're a large org with layers to abstract you away from the lawsuit, getting sued is paralysis for startups. So if you do get sued I'd recommend you settle it if possible, be mad for a few days and then just move on.",1279777938

1537461,story,,,441,202,photon_off,"Ask HN:  Does reading HN ever make you feel like shit?",,"Sometimes when I start reading HN comments I get the overwhelming feeling that I am not even a tiny drop in the giant ocean of talent, knowledge, drive, determination, skill, and genius that collectively contributes to this site.  I have my own ideas that I love dearly and work on, the first of which will be released for you all to play around with and break at the end of the week, but I <i>never</i> leave HN without feeling that no matter what I do, it will never be as good as what I've just read about.  I have my own skills, I got a BS degree from a decent school in Comp Sci a few years ago, and still I barely work with anything other than LAMP and frontend stuff and frequently find myself having no clue as to what some of the submissions and discussions on this site are about.<p>It affects me on a more personal level than I'd like to admit, but I'll do anyway as a way to get it out of my system and see what you all think.  I'm a lone ""founder"" of several websites that I finished up to 80%, then left to collect dust, and am now tidying up to display on a resume since I'm essentially out of money.  Whenever I come here and read the articles and discussions I feel like my ideas, and myself by extension are absolute shit for several reasons.<p>1) So many talented people here.  I don't know the slightest thing about any other language besides Javascript, PHP, Java (from school), and MySQL.  I'm 25.  I work on a Windows XP box and use an IDE because I like the code completion.  I consider myself damn good at the languages I listed, but I get the impression that people here are damn good at way more than this.<p>2) HN shows me all these people and ideas that are succeeding.  It used to be inspirational, but now it's frightening.  I've always been told I'm a smart kid, and that I'll be a millionaire some day, and all of that shit.  I see these ideas gaining traction, some of which I could never be able to do myself, some of which I could have done overnight, and I see myself staying still.  It's overwhelming.<p>3) There are people that post here that are so smart.  There are people here that can express their ideas so clearly.  There are people here that know so much about so many things.  And there's me... I'm not really able to contribute much.  How am I to believe I'm any good at anything?  If you all are to be my competitors, I should just give up now.<p>At any rate, I'm just curious to see if anybody gets the same feelings of being overwhelmed by the amount of awesomeness that's on this site.

Repost to the blogs you posted to and try to see what the people who tried it think, and why they didn't up leaving.<p>Also, make sure your website is solving a real problem. Your site may be 'useful' but unless it solves a problem that currently really really frustrates people, nobody is going to want to spend the effort to go to your site and use your tool unless the problem is solves is really big, and your solution is awesome.<p>I could give more specific advice if I knew anything about your site.

I've never read or heard anything to indicate that church melodies were significantly popular in the 1700s.<p>Popular music was stuff like song, opera, maybe some easy instrumental stuff (though I can't remember when music publishing took off). Bach wrote few songs, no opera, and his instrumental output was very difficult and went largely unpublished.<p>Also, I don't know what the 'Christmas Cantata' is.

We do offer extra subscription time to both the recommending party and the new referral, and we spent a long time trying to figure out the right mix of benefits for both, but I think you're right that without the networking effect there's a lot less interest to recommend people.<p>As you say, it doesn't help you to recommend anyone to a site where the primary activity is independent learning. Now, we could alter that and some social features, but my best guess is that it's not just ""social features,"" because tacking that stuff onto Skritter probably wouldn't help too much! To get maximum gain, we would have needed Skritter to be more easily spreadable from the get-go. :)",1279776249

1537423,comment,1536946,1537191,0,0,hagy,,,"In my experience, having python as the root node for multithreaded C/python programs generally doesn't present a problem.  When calling into external C functions through ctypes, the GIL is released such that multithreading at the C-level is unaffected.  I personally use this feature heavily to perform numerically intensive work with multiple threads as directed through python with C doing the grinding.<p>Additionally, all IO code in the standard library and most C-extensions that I've seen release the GIL around blocking IO calls.  This allows multi-threading to be used for the standard blocking IO use cases.  Further, the computationally intensive routines in numpy and scipy that I’m familiar with also release the GIL to facilitate multithreading at the C-level<p>The GIL only becomes an issue if you want multiple threads to be executing Python bytecode concurrently.  I don’t believe this is a common problem as one rarely runs computationally intensive code at the python level.  Such computationally intensive work is generally performed through C extensions or through external C functions (as accessed through ctypes).  As long as such C extensions properly release the GIL, multithreading at the C-level is unaffected.",1279776124

I don't expect my opinion to be worth a lot to anyone, but I still think there are a lot of questions I'd want answered if I was financially invested in facebook.<p>Firstly the contract is only a couple of pages long and the point about owning 50% of thefacebook is right there in the first paragraph. It might seem ridiculous now that thefacebook was only valued by them at $2000 at that time, but thats only in hindsight. And at a valuation of $2000 1% a day is only $20 a day as a late penalty.<p>No idea about the timing issues, but if the guy thought the deal was successfully completed (afterall he paid Zuckerberg, we have no idea if he cashed that cheque) then as far as he was concerned all was fine and he owned 84% of the business. I don't see how a problem arose until Zuckerberg incorporated and didn't give this guy his fair share - and that happened in summer 2004 (according to wikipedia).<p>As for the unreasonableness of it all, Zuckerberg obviously needed the money at the time and thought that's what thefacebook was worth at the time. Arguably facebook wouldn't be in the position it is now without that guy's money. Maybe he's only entitled to 84% of Zuckerberg's personal share, but thats still pretty significant. Who knows, it might all be a forgery, but it doesn't seem that frivolous to me anyway.",1279775253

If a library assumes a lambda is easy, you will see a lot of code like this (using somewhat bastardized OCaml types):<p><pre><code>  interface 'a collection {\n    void sort(lt:'a -> 'a -> bool);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSo, if you want to use lambdas, you would get:<p><pre><code>  foos.sort(fn x y -> x.bar() > y.bar());\n</code></pre>\nAnd if you don't want to use lambdas, you would get:<p><pre><code>  bool sort_by_bar_gt(x:Foo, y:Foo) {\n    return x.bar() > y.bar();\n  }\n\n  foos.sort(sort_by_bar_gt);\n</code></pre>\nAnd that is assuming you can nest functions, but chances are you will have to put that function somewhere removed from the actual call to sort. This is the exact problem the STL hits: it assumes, for many things, you want a functional style - and then it doesn't give you a way of writing lambdas. You are left with one-off functors littering your code, wishing you could write that lambda.<p>I would like to stress: I think lambdas are a requirement for any language, I just take issue with the argument presented to convince lambda haters.",1279774839

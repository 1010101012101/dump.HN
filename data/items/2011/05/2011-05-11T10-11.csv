I'm also pretty sure that even on 6x7 50mm @ f/6.3 wouldn't give DoF characteristics anywhere near 50mm @ f/1.4 on a DX sensor (as the extreme examples to artificially push them closer together), and they'd have a radically different field of view.",1305111314

2535911,comment,2535825,2535825,2,0,mgkimsal,,,"priceline was a good start at this years ago, but failed to disrupt as much as I'd thought it would.  You're typically buying only one ticket at a time.<p>What they could do is expand to groups.  For example, if <i>I</i> could create a signup site for a particular trip (RDU->LAX) and get X people to purchase from my site, we'd all get the deal at $Y instead of $Z.<p>I think this would throw off the current models airlines live by.  If you and I each buy the same ticket on the same route, even just a few hours apart, we may pay different prices, because of the complex pricing models airlines use.  Group/demand pricing would seem to make sense, but it may shake up the status quo too much, and since they own the data and the product for sale, there's little that could be done.  I suspect groupon may be in a financial position to approach airlines about this to test some ideas, but it's a pretty big change to existing systems for any airline to 'experiment' at that level.",1305111068

So, for example, the US-Australian FTA requires that both countries provides for copyright to exist for at least the author's life + 70 years, or that the only grounds for the revocation of a patent are those that would mean the initial filing was invalid.<p>The USFTA doesn't automatically mean that Australian IP decisions gain legal significance in the US, or vice versa. For this decision to actually have any impact on Amazon's patent in the US, someone would have to litigate it. The Australian decision could certainly be used as evidence in that litigation (as the questions of novelty would be similar), but as noted about would not have any binding authority.",1305110965

They manage to get a few hundred thousand dollars from a VC so that they keep operating for another 6 months. This startup offers a service that is cheaper, safer, quicker and generally more efficient that what is currently available. All of a sudden they'll be breaking the law unless they hand over half a million to the government. They can't find the money. They're done. You never hear about it.

A completely unregulated market may very well stifle innovation also - i.e., when consumer trust of that market is so low as to discourage economic activity. That is a rather extreme case, though.<p>I think the more relevant point is that all regulations have overhead - even ones that don't charge a $500K bond. This is something governments sometimes seem to forget.

Another way might be doing something like crowdsourcing charter jet flights. Anyways I am sure this space still waiting to be disrupted.",1305108478

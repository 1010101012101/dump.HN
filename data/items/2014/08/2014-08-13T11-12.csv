Typing &quot;Visual Studio&quot; nets me one shortcut: &quot;Try Other Visual Studio 2012 products&quot;. I can share a screenshot as proof if you want.<p>My biggest (actually, only real) issue with my Windows 8.1 installation is with the type-to-search feature not being good enough.<p>Let&#x27;s say I want to start visual studio. You&#x27;d expect Windows Key + &quot;Vis&quot; + autocomplete to work. Nope. Visual Studio uses &quot;VS 2012&quot; as the shortcut name. Visual Studio is the name of the start menu <i>folder</i>, but the <i>shortcuts</i> themselves have names that are very unclear and unsearchable on their own.<p>This is not limited to Visual Studio, lots of software (old and new) does this.<p>Similarly, a lot of older software seems to simply have &quot;uninstall&quot; as a shortcut, without the name of the program. So typing &quot;uninstall&quot; will give me dozens of icons without any context about what program it belongs to. If I want to uninstall a program (without going through &quot;Add or Remove Programs&quot;) I have to manually look up the start menu folder and click on the uninstall icon.<p>The fix is easy enough: include start menu <i>folders</i> in the searching. First as labels giving context to search results. Second as search queries that can be done directly, or (ideally but more difficult to implement) as contextual information aiding the search. So something like &quot;[program name] uninstall&quot; resulting in the program name folder, the contents of which are then filtered to the shortcut with &quot;uninstall&quot; in the name.",1407928608

However, conservation measures may unintentionally relax selection by allowing the ‘survival of the not-so-fit’, increasing the risk of fixation of maladaptive traits. Here, we report such a case in the critically-endangered Chatham Island black robin (Petroica traversi) which, in 1980, was reduced to a single breeding pair. Following this bottleneck, some females were observed to lay eggs on the rims of their nests. Rim eggs left in place always failed to hatch. To expedite population recovery, rim eggs were repositioned inside nests, yielding viable hatchlings. Repositioning resulted in rapid growth of the black robin population, but by 1989 over 50% of all females were laying rim eggs. We used an exceptional, species-wide pedigree to consider both recessive and dominant models of inheritance over all plausible founder genotype combinations at a biallelic and possibly sex-linked locus. The pattern of rim laying is best fitted as an autosomal dominant Mendelian trait. Using a phenotype permutation test we could also reject the null hypothesis of non-heritability for this trait in favour of our best-fitting model of heritability. Data collected after intervention ceased shows that the frequency of rim laying has strongly declined, and that this trait is maladaptive. This episode yields an important lesson for conservation biology: fixation of maladaptive traits could render small threatened populations completely dependent on humans for reproduction, irreversibly compromising the long term viability of populations humanity seeks to conserve",1407928599

I mean, you can use it to check your e-mail, chat on IRC.. or basically anything that can be interacted through a window (I.e. mostly anything)<p>Also, mostly everything is a command in Emacs.. So, when you press ""a"" it basically translate to ""call the function insert-character 'a'"". So, in a way, Emacs keybinding are really just a little api over the real commands.<p>In vim, it's a totally different philosophy. Everything is based on making the editor as efficient as possible. Yes you can hack stuff and go on IRC with Vim but conceptually, it's not what it's been designed for and you'll likely hit lots of problems down the road and will have to use all kinds of hack.<p>So, is putting emacs in Vim possible? Vimscript, even thought being an abomination (my opinion), could implement elisp.. with all the necessary wrapper. So, maybe that'd be possible.. but rather useless.<p>Finally, my personal opinion.. with Vim, I really felt like ""tweaking/hacking"" it when I tried to customize it. For instance, I'd try lots of different mapping/paste things found on internet and hope it'd work. Sometime it'd fail for obscure reasons.. and you'd add another hack on top of the hack to fix it.<p>On the other hand, in Emacs, I feel like I'm really coding my editor as I want it. I'm not surprised by its behavior or its interface. I.e. You can bind an event to call a function when a buffer opens. If you know a little bit of lisp, you'll feel right at home.

3206644,story,,,3,0,xpressyoo,"Why I don't like the new Chrome webstore | What about you?",,"At the end of October, Google launched a new Chrome webstore for extensions and applications developed for its browser. The idea was to provide a ""new look"" that would help to ""quickly scan the store and find interesting things to try out"" [1].<p>Although the new look is indeed more ""catchy"", there are (in my opinion) important issues that should be fixed or at least highlighted.<p>= 1) Search | I don't know if you tried recently to search for something in the new webstore, but results tend to be very irrelevant.<p>For instance, let's search for ""Gmail"" [2]. Results will display apps and extensions all together and more importantly results that do have nothing to do with the original query, e.g ""Angry Birds"", ""Plants vs Zombies"", ""Turn Off the Lights"". Clearly, the algorithm puts largely too much weight on the popularity or the number of users of an extension/app.<p>Now, let's be more precise, and let's search for ""ad remover gmail"" [3] - short story, I developed an extension for Gmail called ""Ad Remover and Better UI for Gmail"". Here, again the first result is irrelevant ""MusicSig vkontakte""!! Why the latter extension appears in first position: (i) popular (>100'000 users) (ii)the words ""removing ads"" appear in its description. So, the new webstore algorithm seems to parse and take into account more than before the description of addons and extensions. Again, the weight of the parameter ""description"" should be far less than the one put on the ""name"" of the extension/app to avoid this kind of issues.<p>= 2) Navigation | The new first page uses tiles to present extensions/apps to the user. Basic information available at first glance are the name of the app/extension and number of stars. While it's good to attach the [1-5] stars-scale to indicate the ""quality"" of an extension/app, this measure seems a bit incomplete without indicating the number of users the extension/app has.<p>= 3) Screenshots | When you publish an extension in the new webstore, you must provide screenshots with a size of 1280x800 px. This size is pretty big and not very understandable, especially when you see that those screenshots are resized to half, ie 640x400px [4]. Why don't include a kind of lightbox functionality making possible for the user to click on a screenshot to enlarge it?<p>What do you think of the new webstore? Do you have any insights on the new search algorithm they put in place?<p>[1] Original blog post: http://chrome.blogspot.com/2011/10/making-chrome-even-more-app-ealing.html<p>[2] Search for ""Gmail"": https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/gmail<p>[3] Search for ""ad remover gmail"": https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/ad%20remover%20gmail?hl=en<p>[4] Screenshots example: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dheionainndbbpoacpnopgmnihkcmnkl",1320680538

They just want to learn it, or at least to get a passing grade. The same is the case with high school kids, but the amount of actual work to get a passing grade there is negligible, and they're motivated accordingly. High school teachers cannot just give a failing grade to 80% of her class, because it would mean that there's a problem with her, not with her students. She also cannot depend on necessary prerequisites to serious probability theory to be already known, because it's not, just like university professors cannot depend on probability to be known, because if one learns from books like this, it's not.

(For instance, :<number> was missing to go to a line.. fixed in minutes. I wanted jk to behave like <esc> in insert mode, I've been redirected to a post explaining how to do it, etc.)<p>The great thing about evil (and other vim-mode) is how it is easy to customize it as you wish. IMO, it's even easier to hack than with vimscript. For instance, I rarely use shift+j in normal mode and decided to use it to go go 4 lines down.. same for K and I want it to work in visual mode. Here's how I did it with evil:<p><pre><code>  (define-key evil-normal-state-map ""J"" ""jjjj"")
  (define-key evil-normal-state-map ""K"" ""kkkk"")

This was accomplished by having nodes report as being the next closest hop in the network path to the packet destination. In a decentralized darknet project, I imagine such an issue being much more widespread. In fact, I would imagine a darknet project would actually play in to the hands of the government. It would be perfectly plausible to infest the darknet with millions of your own nodes reporting as the next best hops thus inserting themselves in the middle of all darknet traffic able to analyze data as it flows through the system. Obviously, a darknet would utilize encryption for traffic but all bets are off when you potentially have a constant man in the middle and no centralized authority on trusts. What's worse, and more to the point of playing into the hands of the government is that a darknet would give them (the government) a concentrated focus area. If I were to categorize the percentage of traffic that was ""interesting"" for regular internet traffic vs. the percentage of ""interesting"" traffic of all darknet traffic then I would imagine the darknet having a much higher ratio of noteworthy to junk traffic. If I had a limited amount of resources to invest in analyzing and decoding secure traffic I would obviously point my tools at the most richly dense data source.",1320680032

First, calling a standard Java object from Clojure is extremely painless.  It's a bit more complex if you're dealing with listeners, but in general terms a java object is a java object without very much getting in the way.  This means that all of your favourite GUI libraries are usable without modification.<p>Second, as Carl pointed out, Clojure does have state, it's just tightly controlled.  So tightly controlled that multi-threaded programming is much easier.  There's some things that I'd like on top of what it does, but it's very powerful and useful.<p>Thirdly, I'm not denying that thinking functionally takes a while, but as you develop the skill, it's amazing how many things actually look pretty stateless.  I've met actuaries who use F# for all of their calculations.  Equally, converting game state to a 3d scene graph is a pretty stateless process (although I've yet to meet anyone who's actually getting paid to do functional game programming).<p>Hope that is interesting.

What the .torrent actually contains is a list of the files and how those files are divided up into chunks of equal size (say half a megabyte per chunk). The bulk of the torrent is a list of hashes of each chunk, which allows your client to verify the data it has received from other peers. If you then take a hash of <<the part of the torrent that lists the files and the chunk hashes>> the resulting hash is known as the infohash. The infohash describes this particular torrent uniquely, and it&#x27;s the infohash you send to the tracker when asking for peers.<p>Hopefully from this explanation you can see that you need it for two purposes, one so you can give the right infohash to the tracker, and two so you can verify the data you receive from peers.",1373625352

You&#x27;re just reiterating what I said about curl being great for server testing. But this article is about download performance. When just downloading a largish binary file (eg a tarball), it&#x27;s easier to just:<p><pre><code>    wget example.com/source.tar.gz\n</code></pre>\nWith that, you get a progress bar, it saves the file to disk and basically just does all the sane options you&#x27;d want for downloading by default (which I think is why most INSTALL / README docs tend to recommend wget in their instructions).<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying one is better than the other, but the convenience of wget&#x27;s defaults (which I think you also highlighted later in you post) does tend to make me favour it for downloading binary content (with curl being my go-to for any server testing or text resources).<p><i>> &quot;And next, since I now know curl pretty well, and have it installed all over the place, it is my go-to HTTP command line client.&quot;</i><p>wget also comes as part of the basic install with almost all Linux and other UNIX-like OSs as well.

If the action is low risk, low cost then it may be the wise choice.  You need to remain aware of the uncertainty and that you are basically guessing until a better understanding is achieved.<p>One of the dangers is that initial uncertainty is forgotten and wrong information becomes &quot;common knowledge&quot;.<p>Another danger is where there is there actually is causation but running the opposite way to that assumed.

Recently the dominant anti-Google rhetoric consists of the following formula: &#x27;I&#x27;m moving of of Google services, here is what to&#x27; or any number of Google Reader or federated XMPP laments (which they truly fall under your definition of &quot;evil&quot; then you&#x27;re perspective needs calibrating). The result is not strictly HN material, it&#x27;s not thought provoking and it never stimulated any sort of meaningful discussion. It&#x27;s just boring and pathetic.<p>Yesterday someone submitted about the new revelations regarding Microsoft and the NSA, it never once reached the top. I&#x27;m not suggesting some sort of conspiracy is taking place, but seeing as the discussion on that post somehow veered towards Google would certainly point to an unhealthy obsession HN has with them that is making this place a dull one.",1373623247

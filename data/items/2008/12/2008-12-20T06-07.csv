Why would you be teaching beginners object oriented programming?<p>I give the engineering programming classes at Pitt a fair amount of credit. Two semesters -- the first semester covers HTML as a reasonably useful introduction to the idea of structured text files, then Matlab to introduce if statements, loops, and functions in an environment with a friendly console. The second semester was C. Mostly everyone got it -- those that failed out of engineering didn't fail because of programming class.<p>The classes were taught/conceived by a professor whose primary research interest is engineering education.",1229755740

It described one-bit adders and other hardware and then prescribed a lab assignment that required stuff I couldn't buy at a computer store.<p>Later, I signed up for a CS course at a college, and their textbook was just a glorified Visual Basic tutorial, because at the time, all the companies were looking for Visual Basic programmers.<p>Now, companies are looking for Java programmers, so the schools have switched over to that. Never mind that programming languages have a long history of turning out to be short-term fads (COBOL and Pascal before Java), and the real skill is in understanding the logic underneath the language.",1229755640

Like water when you aren't thirsty, it doesn't matter.<p>Hardware helps performance - but this only matters when more performance is needed. For example, if features or usability are needed, extra performance doesn't help. This is obvious, but it's surprisingly easy to get caught up in improvements that are better, but that don't matter.<p>For productivity of programmers, faster hardware only helps when performance is a problem. The article says: <i>If [it] makes them merely 5% more productive... </i> - that's an ""if"". Will a faster PC make you more productive? These days, compilation is too quick for me to squeeze in a swordfight.  For other hardware (eg large screens) there is also a limit beyond which extra real estate isn't useful (Joel on Software talked about several of his coders that don't use their second monitor). It depends on the task, of course.<p>Faster is <i>always</i> cool and impressive. But like a 300 miles per hour station wagon, will it help you?",1229754920

404355,comment,403869,404255,0,0,boucher,,,"Popular apps do get preferential placement in search -- so much so that exact searches for some apps do not match in the first page.<p>Putting niche apps that demand a higher price doesn't do that much good, because the majority of people looking at the charts won't be in that niche. That's why apps with broad appeal get on the charts. It's also why there are sub charts in each category.<p>As for the the supply issue, you're right. You can't sell anything you want on the store. If anything, though, I think it hurts your argument. By your own definition, Apple is exercising at least some quality control, and preventing you from having to compete with total crap. Unless your app gets blocked from the store (which plenty apps have for no reason), Apple's manipulation in this regard just keeps out your competition.<p>You're wrong, though, about it not being easier to game your proposed chart metric. You're not taking into consideration price manipulation (or questionable ethics). I'm not going to go into specifics, but it doesn't take much imagination.<p>Ultimately, its not only cheap apps that are getting in front of people, which is where I think your argument falls down. The majority of apps are not $1. 60% of the top 10 apps cost more than $1, and 40% cost $5 or more. This holds up for the top 20 as well.<p>You talk about the ""voodoo"" momentum, and I agree, there is a <i>huge</i> upside to getting to the top of the charts. But it isn't the only way to make money on the store. If that was your entire plan, you only have yourself to blame if it doesn't happen. The evidence shows that price is <i>not</i> the determining factor.",1229754492

404351,comment,404009,404252,0,0,kragen,,,"In Pascal, Ada, PL/1, Perl, and C, array assignment or passing an array as a parameter results in a new copy of the array, at least under some circumstances.  (For example, in Pascal, it has to be a value parameter, not a var parameter, and in C, the array has to be inside a struct.)  These are not exactly obscure languages, so it's surprising that you assert there are no languages that work that way.  Do you know any languages other than Java?<p>“Every real language has types,” you say.  Except for BLISS, BCPL, almost any assembly language, Forth, B, the Bourne shell, dc, QED, TECO, sed, and old versions of Tcl, to name a few.  Again, these are not obscure languages; every piece of software you use is inspired by some of them and implemented in part in others.  (There are also languages like Python in which there are only dynamic types, but I agree with your point of view that those are still types.)<p>And that's why I downmodded your comment: not because it was arrogant, but because it was wrong.",1229754260

Is easier to understand than this...<p><pre><code>    print(""Hello world"")

Then you've forgotten what it's like to be a beginner.<p>Java's not even a good example of what OO is, and it has way too much syntax and special keywords (something like 50) for teaching.<p>Python is a far better language for teaching, Smalltalk would be even better because it's much simpler, has only a handful of keywords, and a much more consistent and simpler syntax.<p>In any case, students should begins with a dynamic language where they don't have to think about manifest types that they aren't ready to understand anyway.  It's also much faster working in a workspace or REPL where you have instant feedback and can experiment without messing around with compilers.",1229754259

404348,comment,404009,404009,0,0,tolmasky,,,"What I think is somewhat particular about the challenge of teaching programming is that there quickly develops two distinct levels or types of thinking it's ""difficult"".  I don't see ""programming"" as difficult in the same way that I don't see ""writing papers"" as difficult: it's a piece of cake to get words on the screen that make sense.  Of course, writing a paper can be quite hard depending on the ideas you are trying to express.  Similarly, I think everyone believes programming to be difficult depending on the underlying problem you are trying to solve (for example, no one thinks its easy to solve NP-Complete problems in NP time or to write fast games on slow devices).<p>However, what trips teachers up is that with some students the problem is that they can't even get past the first hump: getting meaningful things on the screen in the first place.  It would be as frustrating as having a student in a college level writing course that always puts the words in his sentences in random order, and expects the reader to ""know"" what order to read them.  Such a teacher would on the one hand be teaching tone and proper structure to one set of students, and basic rules of semantics to another.  I recall many students in my CS classes just rearranging the syntax in their programs hoping the compiler would finally accept it.  Clearly these students are having much different problems than the ones who simply get a little confused when they have a hard bug in their programs or find the idea of pointers unintuitive.",1229754224

It was unclear whether you were only trying to point out that opportunism isn't always moral, or if you were also making the allegation that what the OP had initially done in this case was immoral. (which it is now clear you were not) I was simply comparing the morality of Twitter in this case to the morality of the OP.<p>Second, the position I attributed to you was a natural extension of your argument, if you don't qualify such a statement as part of a discussion I'm going to assume you are applying your suggestion to the discussion as a whole. In this case you brought up that opportunism is not always moral, which is true, but you did not exclude the discussion at hand so I made the assumption that you were implying that the OPs stance was immoral as well.<p>Third, please tell me how you expected ""you fail at reading comprehension"" to lead to any sort of rational debate before you accuse me of the same.

Here is the much lambasted manner of outputting:<p>System.out.println(""Hello world"");<p>...in fact, this is well organized.  ""System"" is a namespace. ""out"" is a static variable.

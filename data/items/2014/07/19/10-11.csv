As I mentioned, it&#x27;s not the fanciest area, but it suits me nicely. Bull and Castle is nearby and has a nice array of craft beers too. Work is less than 10 minute&#x27;s walk away. A place like this in SF close to the office, tourist attractions, and not terribly high crime would be $2 grand+, I think.

8057168,comment,8052233,8057080,4,0,konstruktor,,,"I think congestion is the main reason. If a transmission had unlimited range (hypothetically), the band would fill up pretty quickly, so it would stop being useful. Natural limits of signal transmission and power limits are what makes public, unlicensed bands feasible. They limit the possible uses, but, stochastically, enables many people to use it at the same time.<p>At any repeater hop, the transmission uses double the airtime in the overlapping of the sender&#x27;s and repeater&#x27;s ranges (once while the sender is sending it, once while the repeater is repeating). And of course, if you use repeaters, a single transmission will use the band in a much larger area than a direct transmission.<p>With a mesh network, a product like this would be very problematic: From &quot;a way to connect with friends while off the grid&quot; it would turn into &quot;unlimited free texts for a one time charge&quot; (in a country with absurd charges for texting on mobile phones). Soon, neither this nor any other application on the band would be possible anymore.",1405767271

To add a few to the holes others have listed, you should disable proc_open, popen, pcntl_exec.  How about dl(), to close a (rare) vector for loading native code?<p>While we&#x27;re doing drop-in magic stuff to mitigate problems, don&#x27;t forget to put libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);\n at the beginning of every script.[0]<p>Why not disable file_put_contents?

Surely this is in &quot;badly written software&quot; territory that is exploited by malware?<p>Obviously this isn&#x27;t exhaustive, either.  My point is that you can&#x27;t wave a few boilerplate configurations over any PHP application to make it secure.

(but the other way round, Turkey&#x27;s population is &quot;moderately&quot; sunni muslim, the state is aggresively secular. Iran, the population, I think is fair to say, is secular, the state is aggresively Shi&#x27;a muslim). The sunnis are the ones that are organising things like ISIS, and the religious cleansings ISIS is doing.<p>Problem is that one of the values of islam is to militarily dominate, so aside from Lebanon (and formerly Iraq), there is no example of a state with powre sharing. Even in Lebanon there is only power sharing between Christians and muslims, not between different sects of muslims. (the difference being that Christians don&#x27;t see the need to exterminate muslims (just convert them, eventually), nor do muslims want to exterminate Christians, just dominate them (talking about the values of the religions here). Sunni&#x27;s do want to exterminate Shi&#x27;as and vice-versa. To put it bluntly: sharia is pretty clear on the need to kill any muslim who is not the same sect as you are. But Christians/Jews can get the choice dhimma or death. So Lebanon will not blow up as easily as Iraq will)",1405764942

While I find these advancements in technology intriguing, I use to love going to the cinema but the thought of going to the cinema these days when it is such a disappointing experience these days.<p>Two biggest points which put me off:\n1) People on mobile phones, texting/facebooking etc is bad enough but when did it become acceptable to answer the phone mid film?! \n2) Anti piracy adverts, I have just paid Â£9 or something ridiculous to watch a film! I do not want to see a 1 minute about how I wouldn&#x27;t steal a handbag!<p>When I think about the amount of money I have spent on my home cinema I do cry a little inside, but as a huge movie fan I&#x27;d much rather wait for it to be released and buy the blu-ray (for the same price as going to the cinema by the time you have factored a Â£4 drink into it, parking etc), rip to hard disk and strip the adverts off it and have the ability to pause it :)",1405764329

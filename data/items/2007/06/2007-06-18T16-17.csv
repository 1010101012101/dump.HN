It's boring.<p>So, who is working on something else than web stuff here? Any hardware startups?",1182185091
28908,comment,28651,28651,0,0,dogger,,,"I don't get the flash decision.
Lots of ""wow cool"" flashy transitions etc, but who cares about them when you want to write a quick document quickly on the web.
For that matter who cares about whether it will match exactly when you print it?
All I want is a fast, quick, editor that interoperates with other things easily (eg with a javascript/ajax ui, you can resize the font from the browser etc... not so with flash).",1182184878
28907,comment,28858,28891,0,0,acgourley,,,"Yes, to be totally fair I should say ""web or software startup"" qualifier, but I found it less elegant to type. And really, it seems to be the rare exception among either YC Companies or just discussions on this site. A sign of the times, perhaps, but still a point on the semantics of ""startup"" around here. <p>Honestly I found it annoying for a while, until I realized it would be a waste of time to qualify the term startup <i>every time</i> when it's clear what the domain of conversation is.",1182184715

Back in the day when he was nothing but a developer, he was arrogant as hell, I can only imagine how he is now.<p>And he's arrogant, and produces nothing but commercial flops. He's a typical close minded geek type, he thinks he knows everything, yet is unable to see the big picture.<p>Moral of the story: It's not difficult to be polite. There is no excuse for rudeness, but it will come back to bite your ass, even 8 years later!",1182184600
28905,comment,28703,28780,0,0,Goladus,,,"I don't understand why this post is getting so many points.<p>Any computer game can be automated if you can implement an AI that is good enough.  Saying that ""any game that can be automated deserves to me"" seems kind of silly to me.<p>Calling WoW a glorified Skinner box seems like a similarly useless thing to say.  At that level of lexical precision, news.yc is also a ""glorified Skinner box,"" as is driving to work in the morning and going out for dinner at night.  I don't really see the point of the analogy.<p>It's easy to automate ""various game activities,"" but certainly not all game activities and not most of the ones that really matter.  It would be more accurate to say that there are some specific activities that can be automated, but the expense of that versus the reliability of a human operator is not worth it.  MMOG environments are too volatile, even without considering admins.<p>Warcraft actually allows a great deal of scripting.  Coming from a game like Everquest, the level of automation Blizzard allows is mind-boggling.",1182183779

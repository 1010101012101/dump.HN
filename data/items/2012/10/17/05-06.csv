It features many profiles for specific domains and there is a range of tools to choose from.<p>Embedded systems, avionics, motor vehicle, telecommunications systems are heavily modeled using UML and related techniques.  Industrial control systems less so, but there are areas where they are being used more and more.  In the commercial applications space, there is much advances to be made.<p>The use of modeling is a core feature of most engineering disciplines but only recently becoming a part of software engineering methodologies.  A crashed program is easier to recover from than a bridge that crashes into the water or a microwave tower that comes crashing down in the first big winds.

A distinctive approach.<p>Things that made me uncomfortable:<p>- No Start button (although you can download 3rd party programs to bring it back)<p>- Trying to have two windows next to one another felt much harder to accomplish.

4663249,comment,4663067,4663117,9,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"Ethics != Morals [1][2], by the way. Some things that are clearly immoral in one value system or another are clearly NOT unethical in any system of ethics. Something that is ethical/unethical pretty much always refers to a relationship, for instance. Consider any ""thought"" crime (""coveting"" comes to mind); if you're a native English speaker, describing ""coveting"" to be immoral makes sense (speaking semantically), where calling it ""unethical"" doesn't click.<p>In particular, since ethics are about relationships, they are defined by the (sometimes unspoken) rules of that relationship. The ethical framework of a lawyer/client relationship is different than the ethical framework of two guys chatting at a bar, for example. If the lawyer hears a confession to a serious crime, it would be unethical to report it, while a bar buddy would be ethically clear to report the same crime. I would even argue that a lawyer reporting a confession to the authorities could be considered to be a moral (if unethical) decision, at least in some belief systems, though probably not in all.<p>And in this case...I'm not a marketer, but the fact that the other company was ""furious"" strongly indicates to me that it probably was an ethical lapse. When you're playing chess and someone makes a really key move, you may be disappointed, but you don't get mad. If they take your queen from the board when you weren't looking, you do get mad. The latter is certainly ""outside of the box"", but it's against the rules. And yes, there DO exist ""sore losers"" who will complain even when they have no right to, but I do think it was at least a minor ethical violation here, at least between him and the conference organizers who typically charge to distribute fliers like that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.argee.net/Thrawn%20Rickle/Thrawn%20Rickle%2046.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.argee.net/Thrawn%20Rickle/Thrawn%20Rickle%2046.ht...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://everyday-ethics.org/2008/11/ethics-vs-morals-not-as-easy-as-it-seems/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everyday-ethics.org/2008/11/ethics-vs-morals-not-as-e...</a>",1350451343

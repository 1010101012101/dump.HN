I knew libertarianism was sort of naive but surely you jest ... WSJ is hardly known for scientific rigor. I mean this is hard to take seriously. I don&#x27;t know where to begin.<p>How good would the article be if we were in a time that people may freely be as racist as they want and there were not any social stigmas in the majority about being racist and such racism was commonplace? You would have widespread discrimination and your silly little wouldn&#x27;t solve anything about it. For those playing at home, this was the status quo in the US at one point. You may argue, as libertarians may, that this is all perfectly fine and is the &quot;moral&quot; way but as usual, with your view of &quot;freedom&quot; we would not have a world many would want to live in.",1383548335

6667284,comment,6660325,6662500,2,0,VaedaStrike,,,"I suppose my position is an outgrowth of my very first attempt to build an application. Every component that I took up and learned the &#x27;right way&#x27; to build an application, everywhere I looked, and everything I read, was very counter to the way that the whole system was oriented. After banging my head for a while trying to just get things to work while still doing things &#x27;the right way&#x27; I realized that the tools I was using were never designed for use in an optimal way. You don&#x27;t need an optimal way when you&#x27;re idea of producing something is simply to ramp up how many resources you have on a project. My personal project could never get to where it needed to be without superior tools. The fact that I&#x27;ve not given up on my own project is precisely the reason I have little motivation to go back to things like VB.net.<p>I&#x27;m not one who got on the programming ladder in College or Highschool, I don&#x27;t necessarily have all the time or resources to become the grand horizontal polyglot I&#x27;d love to have the resources to become. The whole reason I choose Clojure is because I found myself at almost 30 years and two years into a project that I&#x27;d been squeezing out of any free-time I could get frustrated that the best advice I could get with all the presently &#x27;accessible&#x27; &#x27;entry-level&#x27; programming tools were constantly in contradiction with each other and obviously built far more with a large corporation in mind than for any lone, starting from scratch, developer wanna-be like myself, they gave lip service to it, but it wasn&#x27;t there. I finally got stuff working and it&#x27;d break and the only way I could get the thing working was to delve into the bowels of visual studio and a bulk of the .net framework. I read some PG and saw the light.<p>So I started from scratch, did my homework and choose Clojure, that forced me down some other paths, none of which I regret, learning enough of Debian to be dangerous, plenty of time banging my head against lots of obstacles. But in all honesty they weren&#x27;t really anything less accessible than the whole .NET jungle was. And when it all started to click I didn&#x27;t feel like I was just stumbling into getting something to work. I actually felt like I had some idea of what was going on. I know I lack a lot. And if my saying that I&#x27;m somewhat adverse to learning CERTAIN languages alienates me from some then I suppose I&#x27;m okay with that as well. Because when I ran into problems with my old attempt at doing things &#x27;right&#x27; with .NET and VB I eventually either restarted my project or just serendipitously got the thing working. Now when I trouble shoot my Clojure projects I know how to eventually find the answer regardless of whether or not I can get someone to help me with it.<p>I really do want to understand the fundamentals better. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;d love to be able to have the entire stack in my mind, heck I&#x27;d love to get down to assembly at some point. But my top priority, the whole reason I choose Clojure as my real starting point into programming is because I know what I want to build and I feel an urgency to get it built THAT is the only reason I&#x27;m, at present, limiting what I&#x27;m learning. I only have so much brain bandwidth and only so much time. My way of striking while the iron is hot is to stay, at present, focused on what I feel, is the right tool.<p>The reason I&#x27;d love a job in this should be obvious, if I can be working on Clojure (or Scala, or Erlang, or F# etc.) programming on the job then that would boost my capacity on my own personal project which is, after all, my whole reason for obtaining a passion in programming.<p>I don&#x27;t have a lack of interest in learning other languages, with the caveat that I want to reinforce the whole driving force behind my becoming a hacker.",1383548252

If not, why did it persist for so long? Where were all of those entrepreneurs fixing the system through competitive advantage?<p>I think the answer here is that the advantages it confers aren&#x27;t sufficient to allow an upstart to overcome its disadvantage--namely, market position. Having more rational hiring practices is not a trump card. Lots of poorly run companies beat well-run ones all the time, but it doesn&#x27;t mean they wouldn&#x27;t be more successful as better-run companies.<p>I&#x27;ll also note that there are a number of confounding factors that make non-discrimination more attractive when enforced corrosively. For example, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re an industry with widespread discrimination against gay people. Gay people leave the industry, and are thus not readily available to those willing to hire them. And perhaps they&#x27;re typically less experienced because of that discrimination, so that makes it less useful to hire them. A sort of tragedy of the commons in the labor market. It&#x27;s still irrational to discriminate, just less so, and perhaps the disadvantages of doing so fit under the noise floor. But with legislation, the feedback loop works the other way, and it makes a lot more sense to hire from this now larger and more experienced labor pool. Could increase the overall output a lot more than having one company float to the top through marginally better hiring.",1383547346

6667229,comment,6666050,6667023,4,0,demallien,,,"Yes! This is the point that always seems to be missed when we talk about abundance economics. There are some goods that aren&#x27;t abundant - housing is one of them. If we can&#x27;t find a solution to long commutes to work / restaurants / theatre / the beach etc then housing Ina good area will remain a scarce good. It will take a bigger and bigger slice of our income, because we are competing with other people, and the abundance of other products, freeing up that money to be spent on housing. If you want to live in the middle of nowhere, you can buy a house very cheaply - they don&#x27;t cost very much to build these days (thanks abundance!) but if you want to live on the river front, or in the cafe district, well, be prepared to sink a large percentage of your income into your house.<p>Of course we may end up finding a solution to the constrained housing supply - maybe populations will decrease, or robotic cars will make commutes shorter / less painful, or maybe we will develop virtual living, with people hanging out / working in virtual reality, not real reality.<p>Housing isn&#x27;t the only scarce good. Being able to go to a live performance of your favourite band, and indeed the host of things that you can&#x27;t do today at any price are other examples. But housing is far and away the scarce good that has the largest impact on most of us, and that is only going to continue to grow in importance in the near term.",1383547220

A2 Milk Full Cream 2L
A2 Full Cream Milk 2L<p>Or the following two strings are the same product:<p>Ambi Pur Air Freshener Car Voyage 8mL. Fresh Vanilla Flower fragrance. - 1 each
Ambi Pur Air Freshener Voyage Primary 8ml<p>Furthermore - some products are not the same, but are similar (for example, Full Cream 2L Milk may encompass various similar products.)<p>What are currently recommended techniques for matching product strings like this?<p>From my Googling, I found:<p>1. Some people recommend using Bayesian filtering techniques.
2. Some recommend doing feature extraction on all the products strings. So you might extract things like brands (e.g. A2), Product (Milk) and capacity (2L) from the products, then create distance vectors between products, and use something like a binary classifier to match products (SVM was mentioned). However, Im not sure of how to achieve this without a whole bunch of rules or regex? Im assuming theres probably smarter unsupervised learning methods of attacking this problem? Price could probably be another feature we could use to calculate the distance vector as well.
3. Others recommended using string similarity algorithms, such as Levenshtein distance, or the Jaro-Winkler distance.<p>Would you use one of the above techniques, or would you use a different technique?<p>Also, does anybody know of any example code, or even libraries for this sort of problem? I could<p>(For example, I saw that some people were having performance problems with calculating the Jaro-Winkler distance for large data-sets.

- tap on thumb-up icon to like
- tap on on comment icon to see comments
- tap links to open
- tap images to load high-res<p>... the easiest way is for you to give it a try.

However, I respectfully disagree with the premise, pointing to the success of Glass-Steagall (read 'government intervention') in maintaining a healthy separation of depository/commercial financial intermediaries and their investment bank counterparts. It was, clearly, the deregulation and removal of said safeguard that allowed for the conditions of 'too big to fail' and gave meaningful, even disastrous implications for the average citizen.

Donald Trump doesn't need a ""To do"" list because he (presumably) works on a manager's schedule -- if he decides he needs to do something he'll tell his assistant to set up a meeting with the relevant person, then he'll meet with the relevant person at the appropriate time and the thing will get done. Also, he doesn't need to worry about the minor errands which most of us need to fill our to do lists with either, since he can just bark ""make me a dental appointment!"" at somebody and it gets done.<p>To do lists are only relevant to those who actually need to sit down and do things on their own.

864743,comment,863219,863450,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"""Anyway, I would be interested in hearing your UI testing success stories.""<p>For Web apps, I use Selenium.  I use the Firefox plug-in to record scenarios,with some hand-tweaking to replace any odd xpath stuff with more robust references to IDs.  I then periodically run suites of UI tests to see that things still behavior as they should.<p>Yes, there are times when page content changes and breaks a test, but it's trivial to see where that is happening, so I've not had a problem keeping them up-to-date.<p>And having automated integration tests is way faster and more reliable than manually clicking through a site.  I've caught numerous bugs this way, mostly in pages that do not typically get much use in real-life (but tend to be the first thing a clients tries when showing off code.  Go figure.)<p>So, with Web+Selenium there's not much overhead to creating and maintaining a set of tests.   It's a big win to be able to kick off a full suite and automatically run through a site far faster and more reliably than I could by hand.<p>It's not so good for desktop apps.  I've been looking at Swinger, which marries Cucumber with Jemmy, for integration testing of Swing apps.  As far as I know there are no good tools for recording user actions, so tests need to be constructed by hand.  This makes it harder to assemble tests that capture assorted complex interactions.<p>But, at some point, someone has to actually test the app itself, so while it's time consuming to assemble automated UI tests, it may pay for itself over time since it reduces the effort in manually walking through the app.<p>So far neither of these would replace unit and functional testing, and neither catch all bugs as experienced by the end user, but they do reduce the number of problems that make it into a release.    For Web apps, the effort spent is well worth it.  For desktop apps, I've yet to reach that balance.  However, things keep improving.",1254851550

864728,comment,864251,864382,0,0,btilly,,,"I am puzzled why you would think that my conclusion would change.<p>You've fallen into a classic mistake.  Science focuses on tractable problems, not important ones.  For instance no matter how wonderful world peace would be, as long as there is no clarity about what lines of research are likely to advance it, it simply can't be science.  By comparison human happiness is unlikely to change if we find the last particle predicted by the Standard Model.  However we know how to go about finding the Higgs boson, its discovery would confirm our understanding of how mass arises, and understanding it could help us towards reconciling GR and QM.<p>I fully grant the importance of understanding the human brain.  I appreciate the effort that is being spent, and that lots of progress is being made.  I've learned a lot by reading about what we have learned.  However there is no coherent story yet, and no sense of which lines of research are likely to lead to fundamental improvements in understanding.  As a result neuroscientists have less of a shared paradigm than the hard sciences.<p>Incidentally your comment below about learning is ironic.  Researchers into memory learned a lot about how timely reminders improve long-term learning ages ago.  They have been trying to shout the news from the rooftops for decades.  There are computer programs that help people follow schedules that really improve how you learn.  But has it had a practical impact on, say, classroom teaching?",1254851274

The post is pretty good, but the book is better. You should read it.<p>If you do read the book, you will see that the discussion begins with Norvig saying that he thinks one of the most important things is being able to keep everything in your head at once. Extra tools come in when the problem gets too big to do that, but here's the key: he saw right from the very beginning that the Sudoku problem could be solved with two tools from the AI toolbox. In other words, he saw the <i>entire solution</i> immediately, and it was never too large to fit easily in his head.<p>Seibel's analysis fine as far as it goes, but he misses the really important thing here, which is that this is not just an example of someone recognizing a problem that they already knew how to solve. It's a case of someone with the mental tools that allow them to dramatically reduce the (apparent) complexity and size of a very large class of problems that happens to include Sudoku. Seibel takes a bottom up look at the data structures Norvig used, but this can be misleading because they weren't designed bottom up, they were designed <i>all at once</i>. You simply cannot do that unless you have the necessary training in abstract thinking (read: mathematics/formal logic/language development/ai techniques/etc).<p><i>No amount of code centric techniques or tools will ever make up for not having these tools.</i> There will always be (relatively trivial) problems that you will never be able solve without them, because you will not be able to fit everything in your head and your ability to reason about the problem will be crippled by that. Debates about TDD are not even wrong, because they are at the wrong level of abstraction. Spending any significant amount of time discussing it is premature optimization.",1254850718

The system then stores the note permanently, i.e, ""d glu dicount socks 1-800-555-SOCK"". You can then search notes by sending a direct message to glu with a ? as the first character. For example ""d glu ? discount socks"" would return all your notes that matched ""discount socks"" as direct messages (actually at the moment it returns the best match and a link to all other matches).<p>It was originally just for me but I've opened it up to anyone.

It's a tangled mass of declarative assertions, nested dependencies, GOTO statements, (naive) version control, and namespaces.  A vigilante action to alter some part of the code essentially has unpredictable consequences for other parts of the code.<p>The changes couldn't be measured if you wanted.  In a management sense, the project is totally out of control.  Big surprise, then, that private enforcement and prisons are a growth industry.  Some people see this for what it is: an opportunity.  Just make sure you're an investor instead of a ""customer.""",1254849610

864604,comment,864296,864296,0,0,briansmith,,,"I don't understand where Oneforty is adding value for developers. If you are a developer of a Twitter app then why would you want to drive traffic there? I would think you'd want to drive traffic <i>away</i> from there and toward your own site. As soon as users end up on Oneforty then (a) the paradox of choice kicks in and (b) if you convert a sale, you are forced to share a big chunk of revenue with Oneforty.<p>Maybe there is some added value that I don't see. But, really, it looks a lot like Yelp, GetSatisfaction, or Ripoff Report: they create this big community focused on saying stuff about your app and it ends up costing you if you participate (in $$$) or if you don't (in customers).<p>Twitter already has an incredibly effective app-discovery mechanism: the ""from AppName"" that appears on every tweet on the website. And, that mechanism is 100% free (for now). I don't really see how oneforty improves upon that.<p>Twitter app development is kind of a no-mans-land right now. Any day, Twitter can change the cost model of developing apps for their platform. Recently, Twitter just made app development much more expensive (in manhours) by adding features that are fairly complicated to implement. In the future it seems likely they will ask for some direct financial consideration too--e.g. charging for use of their trademarks and/or charging for increased API rate limits. So there's a lot of risk from the cost side, because you don't know how much it is going to cost to develop & maintain the app.<p>Plus, there is the problem that 30% of 0 is zero while 30% of $1.00 is far from zero. These AppStore taxes hurt people who charge money for their apps and help the people who don't. In fact, the people who charge money end up subsidizing their own competition in a not-so-indirect way.<p>Now, maybe Oneforty has some plans to add value that is worth more than the value they are taking from app developers. But, reading through the material they present, I haven't seen it. I sincerely hope that they come up with a business model that is a net benefit to themselves and to app developers. But, until then, It seems less risky for (commercial) app developers to nicely ask Oneforty to pull their apps' listings from the site.",1254848575

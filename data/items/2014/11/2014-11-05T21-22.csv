Indeed, if we&#x27;re talking about the voting public, rather than just the general population, the national consensus is likely still in favor of keeping it illegal, since actual voters skew older and more conservative than the population as a whole.<p>Furthermore, the drug policy boat in particular is very big. A lot of this policy, and the institutions implementing it, was developed in the 1980&#x27;s and 1990&#x27;s. In 1991, the consensus in favor of making marijuana illegal was an overwhelming 78-17. Being anti-drug was a political winner, something both sides of the aisle could get behind. Almost everyone old enough to have substantial leadership within the drug enforcement organizations grew up in an intensely anti-drug culture. It will take quite some time for those folks to age out of the system.",1415224634

2. Magic is programming (and vice versa)! I invented a minimal visual programming language for the game.
3. The current cultural context for technology is forbidding to some, so pulling the skill-building out of that context, and into a fantasy world, is more inclusive than most ways of getting started in programming.
4. An author is working on a companion book to go along with the game.

People who&#x27;ve had the chicken pox as a child can and do get it later in life. Vaccines only work by manipulating the existing machinery of the immune system, and so can only do so much. They&#x27;re not meant to be some kind of magical potion that confers perfect immunity.<p>Herd immunity is a key part, however, of how vaccines keep POPULATIONS healthy. By giving a large number of individuals (say, 95%) a significantly reduced chance of catching a communicable disease, the entire population is at less risk of a disease outbreak because it&#x27;s harder for the infection to spread. This is why polio, measles, mumps, etc. have been exceedingly rare in the US in the later half of the 20th century - because large numbers of people were more resistant to catching the diseases and therefore much less likely to spread the disease to others.<p>> Make eradication a priority rather than endless vaccination programs that look like corporate welfare.

<a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/117695213/static/larseidnes.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/117695213/static/larseid...</a><p>To me, this is already revealing. A critique of a web framework and this is the first impression I get? Not off to a good start. There’s a reason people find it hard to trust a fat nutritionist. I see parallels here.<p>Lately there has been a lot of negative feedback about AngularJS and I have been interested in the critiques of its shortcomings. For this reason, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, pulled up the article on my computer, and dug in.<p>His initial complaint about prototypically inherited scope properties (Bad Idea #1) being confusing and &quot;literally impossible&quot; to predict was perplexing to me. He states that he understands a child scope will inherit from its parent scope, yet doesn&#x27;t explicitly instantiate any object on the parent controller in his example of the so-called problem ( <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/1op3L9yo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/1op3L9yo/</a> ). A child of a parent with no properties inherits nothing from its parent -- this seems obvious. If properties are actually defined on the parent the child will inherit them. Is this not the expected behavior?<p>The &quot;fix&quot; for his &quot;impossible&quot; scenario, is to make sure you explicitly define the property on the parent.<p>In his specific example, that would look like this:<p>$scope.obj = { prop: &#x27;&#x27; };<p>( <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/355fuxk5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/355fuxk5/</a> )<p>He complains: &quot;Whether or not a new scope is introduced by a directive is up to its implementer. And if a new scope is introduced, it is up to its implementer to decide if it inherits from its parent scope or not.&quot;<p>How is this a bad idea? I like choices in life, don&#x27;t you?<p>He talks about dynamic scoping being a terrible thing. I think the alternative, dictating One True Way of doing things, removes flexibility. This would be far worse than the current status quo of leaving it up to the developer. He advocates for removing this choice altogether, but is there NEVER a good use case for this &quot;dynamic scoping&quot;?<p>He also complains about the digest loop -- how two-way bindings constantly check for changes and impact performance as your number of bindings grow. There is truth to this, but it is easy to write your own directives that only update UI elements when a change occurs. This can easily be achieved in a variety of different ways. (The most universally familiar of which being a simple callback paradigm.)<p>Building a quality application with angular requires you to think, but I would argue that designing a performant application with ANY framework demands the same thing. You might initially think you get some things for free, but everything has its costs. If you want things to happen automagically, without needing to be explicit about the needs of your specific use case, that&#x27;ll cost you. Is this not a near universal truth in programming? People fault the framework when, instead, they should be faulting themselves: their own laziness or lack of clarity.<p>He talks about having a page listing where their UI already had 2000 bindings and how clicking a &quot;load more&quot; button added another 1000 bindings, killing performance. I can&#x27;t understand why you would possibly have that many bindings... for ANYTHING, unless you&#x27;re Doing It Wrong. Why would you need any two-way bindings for explicitly appended information? When the user clicks &quot;load more&quot;, we know something needs to change. If performance is a concern, why would you ever allow that listing to be automatically updated by checking for changes on every digest cycle? Instead, you can either explicitly update the element when the action is called (no two-way bindings), or use a SINGLE binding for the entire list. 1000 bindings? What could possibly be the justification for that?<p>Bindings can be drastically reduced and performance dramatically improved if you work to optimize your code and move from prototyping with built in ng-* components, to crafting components explicitly for your needs. I truly believe the standard ng-* components are meant more for prototyping and to serve as an example for how you can accomplish similar things as your write your own application specific code. Not being clear about this is perhaps one of angular&#x27;s biggest failings.<p>Does it really surprise any programmer or developer that in order to achieve high performance in your application, you must architect explicitly for your use case?<p>To put it another way, in order to make a great application, you need to understand what is happening under the hood. If you&#x27;re using components that you don&#x27;t fully understand, that end up running a bunch of unnecessary operations, is that the framework&#x27;s fault, or your own?<p>Is it really the role of the framework to do your development for you? You can either have things happen automagically, or have things be performant, but not both. This is reasonable and beyond logical, I think.<p>He critiques the language used in the documentation to explain controllers and hangs his hat on what he feels is the misuse of the word &quot;constructor&quot;. His contention is that this is incorrect because the controller functions are being applied to an existing scope, not being instantiated in the traditional sense. Yet, and he even admits this, he is critiquing documentation that is over a year old. The current docs do a better job of clarifying what&#x27;s actually happening. How is this a fair critique of a framework? Cherry picking year old documentation... this just seems silly, and as someone else said, disingenuous. Nothing is perfect, especially out of the gate, especially in open source -- I think we all know that.<p>His further complaints in this section employ the same strategy -- he takes segments from the documentation out of context and explains why they don&#x27;t make sense. He even says that their use of the term &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; to describe the many options for creating components (services, factories, providers) is incorrect because, in his mind, &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; would imply a direct syntax modification to JavaScript or implementation of a custom language parser. Really?<p>Let&#x27;s see what Wikipedia has to say on the subject:<p>&quot;In computer science, syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language &quot;sweeter&quot; for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar</a>)<p>Soooo, for example, angular&#x27;s service and factory being abstractions over the provider implementation? When you don&#x27;t need the full power of a provider using these higher level functions makes it more concise, easier to use, and &quot;sweeter&quot;... sounds like syntactic sugar to me, unless we&#x27;re just being pedantic for the sake of it.<p>He says, &quot;Angular seems to strive to make things as complicated as possible.&quot; I would argue that this simply isn&#x27;t true, is shortsighted, and borderline insulting to the intelligence and efforts of angular&#x27;s core team. I believe AngularJS is opinionated but it strives to make things as flexible as possible and as a result some inherent complexity exists.<p>In my (almost) 2 years of working with the framework, this is what I’ve found: AngularJS is extremely flexible. Its built in components are great for quick prototyping and its underlying structure provides an excellent FRAMEWORK for creating more purpose built, application specific, code. In my experience, angular is there when you want it to be and quickly gets out of your way when you don&#x27;t need it. This is a robust framework. It is built for rapid prototyping and creating complex, performant applications (when properly executed). It is not baby&#x27;s first framework.<p>How many times have we heard the old adage that, with most things in life, you get out what you put in. This is doubly true for angular (and development as a whole, I would speculate). If you&#x27;re willing to put in the work, AngularJS can be a phenomenal tool in your arsenal. It can also be great for getting a prototype together, but one must understand, that a prototype is just that. Using ng-* components everywhere and expecting everything to work out optimally is just not going to happen. Did you REALLY think it would?<p>To pull a quote from his last paragraph:<p>&quot;... many people like to recommend projects they haven’t used in any depth, because the idea of knowing what the next big thing is feels good. The result is that people choose frameworks largely based on advice from people who don’t know what they’re talking about.&quot;<p>The irony here is palpable. Change &quot;recommend&quot; to &quot;criticize&quot; and &quot;knowing&quot; to &quot;condemning&quot; and I almost needn&#x27;t say more (he says, 8000 words later).",1415223804

Maybe the federal government could not have full de-jure legalize for some technical reasons. But it is completely capable to restrain the zeal of prosecution and reduce both the number of cases and the priority of those to a wide degree. If only they wanted to.
Instead, the government tries to squash the legalize even when it happens (look up Operation Choke Point[1]). It&#x27;s not something forced by treaties, it&#x27;s a voluntary act. Not that the US is in mortal fear of sanctions from Pakistan or Colombia for not fighting drugs enough, but it&#x27;s not treaties that make police kill a teen because they suspect he has a small bag of drugs [2] or kill a senior citizen in his own bed because they suspect he has some drugs (he didn&#x27;t) [3]. It&#x27;s something that the government can and must fix, and no treaty prevents it from doing so. The legal technicalities can come later, but the switch from a mentality where the government is at war with its own citizens should happen now. It should have happened years ago, actually.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/05/24/operation-choke-point/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2014/05/teen-dead-after-alabama-police-shoved-sharp-object-into-throat-to-retrieve-drugs-2956750.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2014/05/teen-dead-after...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/15/yet-another-example-of-why-americas-drug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/15/yet-another-example-of-why...</a>",1415223153

Relatively side effect-free drugs like modafinil and piracetam are worth trying, and if a doctor does diagnose you with some issue then you could look into more serious prescriptions.

I am a bit confused about this.<p>I am already 28. I wanted to do a startup since I was 18. I started a few things on the side in the past 7 to 8 years and learnt a lot from each of my mistakes.<p>I started a few months back (my latest sideproject) and got my first paying customer ($400 per customer). I have a 9 - 6 job.
I have trouble following instructions, paying attention and very restless. I have trouble focusing on work that I don&#x27;t own 100%. I am a terrible, error-prone, procrastinating employee. There is 0% chance that I will be able to work for other people.<p>My question is: Do I quit my job and pursue my passion full time? Steve Jobs, Paul Graham, Tony Hsieh and host of other entrepreneurs suggest this route to become a successful entrepreneur.<p>Or should I be resourceful and just grind away. Like how Gary Vaynerchuck, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Patio11, James Altucher and a bunch of others recommend.<p>You know, work on the day job. Do the appropriate amount of work and get back to grinding on your project from 6:00 pm - 2:00 am everyday and 10 hrs per day on the weekends. This is what I am currently doing by the way.<p>If I screw up, I will lose the savings I built up. (I don&#x27;t mind it too much.) But it will screw up my dating prospects.  If I suck it up and date/get married/have kids and continue working. I might end up not giving my project 100% and I might regret later in life that I did not take the risk and that I compromised. I am afraid I would get stuck in a job for the rest of my life. Some of my colleagues do great work and they seem to genuinely be enjoying coming in to work everyday. Unfortunately, my brain is not hardwired that way.<p>So, do I take the big risk and follow my passion or just suck it up, be practical and grind away till I get a lot of revenue from the sideproject and then quit?",1415221632

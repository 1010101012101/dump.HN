5822353,comment,5817728,5821886,3,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>Taxation is a big deal. It's intrinsically coercive. It should only be used on really important things, not for things like shutting up some interest group somewhere, or buying votes, or lining the pockets of your buddies, or worthless administration (and please note the word ""worthless"" isn't superfluous there), or any of the other myriad of ways government can coercively spend the fruits of our precious, precious time on this planet.</i><p>That's a very good point.  I, for one, consider taxation to be theft, plain and simple.  But yet I don't try to defend myself from this theft via force, for pragmatic reasons (they employ more men with guns than I do, for one).  So, I grudgingly tolerate a certain level of coercion, even though it is extremely distasteful to me.<p>BUT... I maintain that if you're going to steal my money and spend it - nominally - in my name, then you better damn well spend it wisely and on something important.  This is one reason government agencies piss me off so much.. I see so much waste and inefficiency and fraud and other shenanigans, and it just enrages me that they are taking my money and blowing it on idiotic shit, or - worse - things that I'm fundamentally morally opposed to.",1370383180

You should not be allowed to sell a patent. The intent of a patent is to give the inventor(s) enough lead time to develop the idea, not to create a market for ideas.<p>Why are ideas worth nothing? If I have a breakthrough while researching, I'm screwed unless I <i>also</i> manage to form a company with a production line?<p>> 2. A patent should not be valid unless you can demonstrate it. You shouldn't be allowed to own ideas that are beyond your means to execute.<p>Would a prototype be acceptable, or does it have to be viable for production? Also, between coming up with an idea and being able to show it as viable might be a reasonable amount of time<p>> 3. There should be very low limits on patent infringement damage claims thereby removing the financial incentive of using patents and anti-competitive and extortion weapons.<p>This one feels the most concerning. If the limits are low, then why would anyone bother following them? You could easily make it cheaper for big companies to copy ideas and run with them, then pay people off when they get caught.<p>Anything that encourages people who have a new, innovative idea to hide it to try and make money is against the original aim.<p>I do, in general, like the approach though. Maybe there are points along the way:<p>1. You have a new, awesome, innovative idea. You can get a patent for it.<p>2. You have to show some working, or viable prototype within a certain time period (short, a few years maybe)<p>3. With a real example, you can then get a longer patent.<p>4. You can sell it, but the original time limit still applies.<p>This way you're compensated for coming up with great ideas (but you or someone you sell it to has to be able to make it a reality soon) and have to release how things work into the public domain (the original intent of patents).",1370383013

An exit can be an acquisition by an already-public company, or an IPO (taking the company public).<p>In the first Dot Com bubble, companies would IPO before reaching profitability and sometimes even before reaching significant revenue. For a number of reasons (scrutiny from Wall Street, public reporting obligations, Sarbanes-Oxley), companies that intend to go public increasingly choose to delay their IPOs.<p>In 2004, Google went public with 2003 revenues of $960m and profits of $105m. In 2012, Facebook went public with 2011 revenues of $3700m and profits of $1000m.<p>One way shareholders managed their longer time-until-IPO horizons is by selling their stock on the secondary market. Many startups (SecondMarket, SharesPost, etc) were set up to help shareholders of successful companies like Facebook and Twitter sell their private company stock to qualified investors.<p>The transfer restriction quoted above means shareholders can't transfer (sell) their stock until IPO or unless they have the consent of the board.<p>Investors tend to have long-term horizons and may not care about getting locked up in an investment until IPO. In any case, investors are well represented on boards. Founders have leverage with the board and can negotiate partial cash-outs (selling some of their common stock to investors), but in any case own their shares outright and can hold on to them until IPO.<p>Employees with incentive stock options, however, can get screwed. Options are not stock and (even after having vested!) will expire if the employee quits or gets fired. If the company is doing well, the Fair Market Value (FMV) of the stock may be much higher than the employee's exercise price, which means exercising the options will incur a large Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) penalty. This means an employee might have very valuable, vested stock options but no way to keep them upon leaving the company because exercising can put them in a tricky cash flow situation where the IRS expects them to pay taxes on unrealized (and unrealizable, because of transfer restrictions) capital gains.<p>This term sheet is generally founder-friendly, but the transfer restriction is certainly not employee-friendly.",1370382613

In fact each such language tends to be described in exhaustive specs.<p>> Anyone doing the equivalent of currying or macros (making up ones own language) would be thrown out. I would think its probable that when programming is as old as engineering its modes of expression will be similarly limited/standardised.<p>Both things are very broad when it comes to what can be made using those languages. A civil engineer may use his language to build a house, a sky-rise, and a nuclear power plant. Each of those will have different complexities, and a different requirements of knowledge and qualifications. In fact I imagine the Engineer working on the latter will know how to do a lot of things that the Engineer who works on the former would consider to be akin in complexity to currying and macros.<p>The situation is the same in programming. Some people may be working on projects currying, macros, and other techniques are a major benefit. These are after all extremely powerful tools.

5822220,comment,5820590,5820590,9,0,Bjorkbat,,,"Kinda reminds me of back when I used to grow organic vegetables for a living.  Well, tried to.  The farmer I worked with specialized more in meats and the like, and together me and him would drive down to Houston and The Woodlands to make deliveries, because that's how we operated, people placed their orders and we delivered at designated spots.<p>I learned a lot of things during that period, but the weird thing is, the one that really stuck was how weird people with money can be.  Oh, sure, we had our share of middle class customers, but for the most part we delivered to doctors, lawyers, business owners and the like, who would thrown down anywhere from $200 to $1000 per order on meat and act like it was nothing.  I don't think they really cared about some of the values that come with the whole local foods movement, or the values that come with organic farming, they just heard about some health fad, decided to buy this meat, and stuck with it because it tasted good.<p>This is just the same really, only on a much more epic scale.  Yeah, these people were rich, but at best their net worth was around $5 million, so their obscenities were limited to just buying ridiculous amounts of meat for an absurd amount of money while bringing it back home to their McMansion in a new BMW or a Mercedes, sometimes a Cadillac Escalade if they insisted on being that revolting.  When you have a net worth that extends beyond the billion dollar line, then the obscenity of your purchasing choices is virtually unlimited.<p>And yet, you have these other titans with net worths that dwarf the net worths of so many other people who could do the most obscene crap with their money...but they don't.  There's no shortage of rich people who are generous with their money, but at the same time there's no shortage of rich people who are just weird with it.  I've ultimately decided that the difference is that the former never gave much priority towards money in the first place, but they got it anyway, or they had priority at first but changed their minds afterwards because they have large minds, and now money is merely a tool for greater things.  Then you have that latter group of people who really wanted money, and made conscious efforts towards that goal, but in the end small minds are limited in ambition, so they make limited amounts of money and flaunt their petty wealth in ways only a small mind can, with fancy cars, McMansions, and large quantities of really expensive meat.<p>Sean Parker is just another one of those small minds, only he was one of the few who got a little luckier than most, acquired wealth those little fish could never possibly hope to achieve, and spent it in a way a small mind typically would, by disregarding the natural legacy of an old growth forest so he can build some tacky castle in the middle of it, all the while letting his construction crew make all these amateur mistake, because once again, a small mind.<p>I certainly hope my mind is bigger than such frivolities, just in case.",1370381504

However, if you were to export the chart as a .PDF, the aliasing artifacts would completely disappear (or at least be comparable with the Python-rendered example).  I use this technique when I make some quick charts/graphs in Excel and want to include them in a LaTeX document.  You can move a chart/graph to it's own full-page ""worksheet"", and then Save As a PDF file.  Since the PDF output is in vector format, it works nicely with LaTeX documents (as you can use \includegraphics{} natively with .PDF documents), and scales well to any size without artifacts.<p>That being said, there is one thing I do agree with here: the way MS Excel renders graphs/charts when editing them is pretty horrible.  You can, however, get around the issue by choosing an appropriate output format (you might just have to zoom in a lot when editing to avoid the aliasing temporarily).",1370380648

Perhaps I am projecting, but generally when people are at pains to point out that things are not free and there's a cost, what they mean is that there's a net cost to society (or think that there is) and that the money would be best spent somewhere else or not collected at all. When you lead off with a complaint that the money from social programs was extracted from you by 'coercion' the implication is that you're being forced to pay for something people should have to finance themselves.<p>I really don't get how you think this is a net good move but couch your argument in the form of a complaint about the government taking your lunch money. By definition, a net good is economically less costly to provide than to withhold.

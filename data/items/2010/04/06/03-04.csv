You're 500 feet above the one of the most dangerous cities in the world [1], a warzone that's claimed the lives of thousands of young men, just like you, and you've just taken out the armed enemy. That <i>was</i> the enemy. And that guy laying there still <i>is</i> the enemy. And so is anyone helping him. And now a van has pulled up, unidentified. You don't know who or what is in that van and whether it is armed or not. You know the reality,the statistics, and they're not in your favor. So you do as anyone in that situation would do, with limited information and a hell of a lot of empirical data. You neutralize the threat.

1243801,comment,1241879,1243635,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""If the US wanted to conquer Iraq, it seems like it would have been over already.""<p>No it wouldn't. (As you say don't get emotional about this). Except genocide, which wouldn't be acceptable in this century, what exactly would the US do differently without having an even more aggressive insurgency?<p>The US has  conquered Iraq, in the sense of defeating and disarming its armies, executing its leader and occupying territory. The problem it has is in getting sections of the conquered populace to go a long with its designs for them.\n""9 years in and still at a stalemate, moving at a snail's pace"" is <i>in spite of</i> everything the US Army could do.<p>So again I ask you what exactly would the US do differently than what it did if it were (in your opinion) a ""real"" conquest? I would say that troops of another nation occupying your country for many years, and planning to stay (albeit on a reduced scale) for many more and maintaining a monopoly on heavy weaponry (tanks, planes, artillery etc) while building up a local collaborating militia is the definition of ""occupation"" or ""conquest"".<p>This is exactly what the Soviets did in Afghanistan, for e.g. (Iran is doing what the US did then  by providing arms, motivation and ideological support to people who fight the invasion, but on a comparitively reduced scale. Nothing like the Saudi/Pakistani/US tieup that formed to help the Afghans fight the Russians). If the Americans aren't ocupying Iraq, the Soviets didn't occupy Afghanistan either and that just doesn't seem to be a sensible conclusion.<p>Do you have a different definition of ""conquest"" or ""occupation""? To the rest of the world, what the US does/did in Iraq and Afghanistan does look like occupation.<p>As a (by and large) supporter of the United States (I'd rather see the US win than some kind of deranged Islamic theocracy, the poor Iraqis don't have any good choices) I suggest the problem is not that the US didn't occupy Iraq, it is just that the US is way in over its head wrt the *post invasion"" bit of the operation. The invasion went smoothly. The post invasion occupation is where the US struggles. It is very hard if not impossible for  a democracy with a free media to fight a war for very dubious ends and maintain support ""back home"" over 8 years with steadily mounting casualties and huge expenditure of treasure during a recession.<p>Coming back to your post, how (in your opinion) would a ""conquest"" look different? How would the insurgency go away if the US adopted different tactics? Except for massive scale concentration camps/genocide/scorched earth tactics which wouldn't be acceptable in the US or Europe or anywhere else really these days, how would it not face any less of an  Islamic insurgency and/or do better?<p>(There seem to be hyper patriot US readers here who downvote anything that suggests the US  invasion of Iraq is an occupation and the Iraqis may be somewhat justified in fighting back.<p>Just think of what you would do if the USA were invaded. Co operate with the invaders? Or fight back any way you could?<p>Interesting how  some people in the US think the US troops and mercenaries like BlackWater are anything but an occupying army in Iraq.)",1270526294

Anyone who's ever spent time on the ground in country will tell you the same. If you are going to fight an insurgency war, you have to engage these individuals. We have made it VERY well known throughout the country that they cannot even make it look like they are going for weapons. The problem with this situation is one i've seen personally on multiple occasions... The Van pulls up, takes the bodies of the men, leaves any children/women, and takes all the weapons. Then they take pictures, and blast them across the airwaves saying Americans murdered unarmed women/children.<p>Queue the downvotes, but i speak from experience. If you sent us over there to operate under the absolute ""good guy"" mantra that you all expect, we'd end up with 100x more losses than we already have...

1243742,comment,1242271,1243070,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Those are the two I'd personally care about, and so are the two I come up with.<p>However, one of them accounts for something like 90% of all the use cases I've ever seen proposed, in any forum, anywhere, for third-party multitasking on the iPhone, and really just boils down to one word: ""Pandora"". I've said elsewhere and will say again that Apple could probably placate a huge number of people simply by giving Pandora and <i>no other third-party application</i> an exception to the multitasking policy.<p>But in a larger sense I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that there are many ""awesome use-cases that nobody has thought of yet"", simply because of the two fundamental problems: form factor and resources.<p>First, the form factor problem: a mobile phone's screen can only be so large before the device stops fitting in a pocket, which means you get a certain amount of total UI real-estate, and that's it. Unfortunately, it's a pretty tiny slice of real-estate, which means that the traditional multitasking interfaces -- multiple windows, or multiple panes within a larger container --  don't work. You just don't have room on that screen for four or five applications and clear delineations between their screen areas to all be displayed simultaneously; you really don't even have room for two, because even if you cram all your stuff into that space you're still going to run right into Fitts' Law and have something that's unusable.<p>This means you get only one realistic UI option, which is that every application runs ""full-screen"". This may not mean using 100% of the screen area, but the size problem means you need to use so much space that there really isn't room for much else to fit alongside it. As a result, all the cool kids in the mobile OS field (iPhone OS, Android and WebOS) are doing the ""fullscreen app"" paradigm.<p>And then there's the resource problem, which has been discussed endlessly but not in particularly constructive ways. Every application that's running needs to have code and data resident, and a huge number of them want a network connection too. This means every additional application eats up more memory (a scarce resource on a phone-sized device) and power from running one of the device's radios (ditto -- and note that even if the app someone's interacting with at the moment doesn't need a network connection, odds are that some other running app does, so you don't even get a break when the user's not directly interacting with a network-using app).<p>This is a resource-management problem, and whatever solution is used for it will inevitably cascade back up into the UI. WebOS uses a card metaphor to cycle between applications, but launch a bunch of applications and the UI goes from responsive to... well, not responsive. Which suggests that, nice as the metaphor might be, it doesn't really work.<p>The other option, which is the one pretty much everybody else is going with these days, is to have a monitoring process serialize the state of and then terminate one or more applications when resources start running low. This also has the advantage of fitting nicely with the already-necessary fullscreen-app UI because from a UI perspective there's no interaction difference between ""Leave App A running, but move App B to the front"" and ""Save App A's state, terminate it and launch App B"". If you don't believe this, note that it's exactly what Android does when it runs low on resources; unless you're watching a process monitor you have no reliable way, as a user, to tell what it actually did when you hopped from App A to App B.<p>This is also indistinguishable from what the iPhone already does; any decent application already saves state on normal termination, so the fact that the application isn't really running anymore is only noticeable if it was meant to keep doing something in the background (like play music or pop notifications in response to events).<p>Which means that basic, built-in constraints of running on a mobile-phone-sized device, all by themselves, drastically limit the opportunities for meaningful multitasking. Because of the form-factor problem you can only ever have one application doing actual user interaction at a time, while all others have to sit in the background and do whatever they do without displaying interface (other than notifications) or requiring any serious interaction from the user (basically, you can pop ""this thing happened"" or ""would you like to do X? Yes/No"", and not a whole lot else because you don't have room for more UI without stealing <i>full-screen</i> focus, which is, again, indistinguishable from a serialize-and-terminate-and-launch).<p>Which brings us back, basically, to ""play music while some other app is being used"", and ""pop up notifications"". That's not exactly a rich playground of possible use cases; music is, well, music, and notifications are basically only worthwhile to do when:<p>1. Event X happens (e.g., IM or SMS received).<p>2. Clock reaches Time X (alarm, reminder).<p>3. Device arrives at Location X. This offers the largest number of possibilities, but there are still only so many pseudo-geocaching games, walking tours and social-network things you can do without flooding the app market with a bunch of essentially-duplicate applications.<p>So... yeah, there's really only the two use cases for multitasking: music, and notifications (which I tend to lump under ""IM"" since that's the one people would probably use the most).<p>As a side note, what's best for enabling this is not actually full multitasking (in the ""every app stays completely resident running all its stuff"" sense), but something much more like daemons which periodically wake up and do things.",1270523863

As about workload, you will invariably encounter systems programming, operating systems, compiler construction and some theory class. Of course, this may not be true everywhere but is an indication of a good grad program's basic requirements. To succeed in those classes (and beyond), you would be advised to have a good grasp of at least C, Java or C++, data structures and algorithms.<p>Now, if you really want to go through with this, you can succeed if you spent some time studying. Start with MIT OpenCourseWare. Master the intro class with python as a gentle intro (checkout Google's Python class for great intro). Then write those some programs in Java. Then, write those same programs using Object Oriented Programming.<p>Then look into data structures (arrays, lists, hashes, trees) and the big algorithms (start with path finding - dijkstra, other shortest paths, sorting, and if you have time - strongly connected components, suffix tries, etc.) Another big concept you need to understand is Big O notation - something that tells you how complex a given program or algorithm is (it's nice to know sometimes to compare one algorithm to another on basically how fast it can run - e.g a big O of n^2 O(n^2) is worse than O(n))<p>Now, all of the above is just good preparation for the fun parts you will do in a Master's. You should spend some serious time hacking around with C (get this book - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_%28book%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_%28b...</a>).

There are some nice interdisciplinary programs where you may not have to do all the hardcore stuff I mentioned above but still dabble into as much detail as you'd like.

There's a grey area when it's not clear if a person helping a combatant to cover is a civilian or a combatant.<p>That's the first part. The second part is that the Army and other forces have made it very clear that attempting to take any weapons from the battlefield counts as engagement, and they will fire at anyone attempting to do so. Apparently this was a big problem during the start of the war - if they took out insurgents, their guns would often be grabbed and ran away with, and presumably used again later.

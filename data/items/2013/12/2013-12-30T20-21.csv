6986902,comment,6985207,6985207,6,0,captainmuon,,,"Python fell into the Winamp trap. If anyone remembers, version 3 was pretty much crap, and many users stayed with 2.95 for ages. Now, I&#x27;m not saying Python 3 was bad, not at all, but the benefits don&#x27;t outweigh the cost of switching for many people.<p>Here&#x27;s my idea. Make a new &quot;Python 5&quot; (2+3=5, or call it whatever you want), based on Python 3. Put back everything that was deprecated or removed along the way, including the `print` statement. Provide `from python2 import xx` or `from python3 import xx` if there are incompatible module changes. To deal with the string changes, introduce an idiom like:<p><pre><code>    bytes, str, unicode = python2_strings\n    bytes, str, unicode = python3_strings\n</code></pre>\nor:<p><pre><code>    from python2 import bytes, str, unicode\n    from python3 import bytes, str, unicode\n</code></pre>\nwhich always maps &quot;bytes&quot; to the byte array (py2 &quot;str&quot;, py3 &quot;bytes&quot;), unicode to the unicode char array (py2 &quot;unicode&quot;, py3 &quot;str&quot;), and &quot;str&quot; to whatever the legacy code needs.<p>The goal would be to have 95% of legacy code run without modifications, or with a minimal addition of 2 lines to the top, or a command line switch.",1388437153

He is extremely careful and precise in his language, without coming across as robotic or inhuman. It&#x27;s impressive.<p>But this kind of thing is going to continue to happen. There is no market for taking an honest man at his word without reading subtext into it. The opinion ecosystem is a cesspool of the worst pieces of humanity. &quot;Reporting&quot; on Silicon Valley from the east coast would be hubristic and a folly if the organs involved had any intention of doing so honestly.<p>PG is fortunate that he is self-employed which provides some barrier against the power of the easily-offended. Somehow the talkers have gained power over the doers, and it is wrong. We live in a time when a person lower in an organization could easily find himself out of a job for an off-handed remark.<p>Teddy Roosevelt most eloquently described what is wrong with Gawker:<p>&quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;",1388436932

This is part of what I like about it, but it comes with a cost - this exact problem.<p>I actually find the unicode thing a good enough reason to move to Py3, and porting my company&#x27;s own code is hardly and issue. But I just had a quick look at how much of our dependencies support Py3. No surprise - we can&#x27;t move. Not without porting a huge amount of code we don&#x27;t know by ourselves and hoping the pull requests get merged, or by dropping big dependencies from our code.<p>How big? Thrift, boto, MySQL-python, hiredis (the native C redis connection layer), fabric, mrjob - just to name a few. Some of these have big non compatible dependency trees themselves.<p>Neither of those are going to happen. So not having a big enough incentive is not my problem here. The price of migrating is simply too big compared to the incentives.<p>I think the only big enough incentive that would cause me to consider replacing or porting all this huge chunk of dependencies, is something indeed along the lines of GIL-less massive concurrency a-la Go.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening any time in the foreseeable future. Python 2.8 is a good idea for me as a user, but it will only persist the problem, not solve it.

Revenue comes from my massive ad network (which my competitors don&#x27;t have), so I can sustainably run the business like this for as long as necessary to force the incumbent to fold.  I now have the local monopoly, which I can use as I see fit.

That brings me more internet-users, which makes my ad network more valuable.  Since I have a monopoly, I can also rent-seek with respect to internet access fees (though I might keep it at $0 to encourage end-uses to continue clicking on ads).<p>I will then repeat this process in other cities until I have a nation-wide monopoly.

The reason this has become popular is because low barrier-to-entry comment sniping is great fun and this version of Godwin&#x27;s Law makes it child&#x27;s play.  However it is nothing to be respected.<p>There is a line of reasoning that states that comparisons to Hitler are damaging to society because they necessarily &quot;cheapen&quot; the memory of what the Nazis were and did.

I submit that refusing to compare things to Hitler unless they are demonstrably already as bad as Hitler cripples our ability to learn useful lessons from that dark period in history.

The most common criminal use of a gun consists of a few rounds, rarely exceeding the capacity of these restricted size magazines. If we move to the much more rare mass shooting, we see that magazine size doesn&#x27;t really reduce the body count. In the Virginia Tech shooting, for example, the shooter killed 32 people and injured 17 more with only 10 and 15 round magazines. In exchange for this limited or non-existent benefit, you seriously inconvenience gun owners who will likely never misuse their guns.<p>The opposition to background checks isn&#x27;t necessarily unreasonable, either. Pretty much all of the mass shootings in the US in the past 15 years have been carried out by people who would have been able to pass background checks. In the more common cases of illegal gun use, the user tends to be a felon who already got the gun through black market channels. Perhaps the benefit here is greater than the magazine capacity restrictions, but I don&#x27;t know. I do know that background checks have been used to create a special tax on firearm transactions that greatly exceeds the cost of doing the checks. I also do know that these background checks have been used to create databases that were later used to confiscate firearms. Pretty much all the practical objections to background checks could be worked around if legislators wanted to.

The problem with apps is that everything that is a website today will become a native app tomorrow. App developers might claim that their app is more secure than using a website to do the same thing, because of the included native crypto implementation. Users might then associate any native app with having greater security than a website accessed through a browser (which may not necessarily be true.) Users might become further desensitized to installing everything from the internet as an app.<p>Why is this a problem? Websites normally cannot access things like your personal files, without you explicitly choosing a file from your computer using a file dialog, whereas if you run a native app with your user credentials, it is immediately able to access any file that you have permission to access, without necessarily informing you.<p>Perhaps OS-level security and sandboxing is going to have to improve for this sort of thing to be a good option.",1388435795

Most of all the unicorns, being the most real part of the deal. At least until people realize that regulatory capture is not some excess of the regulation, it is a direct and inevitable consequence of it. There&#x27;s no people that can understand the industry enough to regulate it but the people of the industry. There&#x27;s no people that are motivated enough and having enough concentrated resources but the people of the industry. Thinking that you can beat a team of industry experts knowing everything about their industry and already having majority of regulatory body composed of their former coworkers by chanting &quot;power to the people&quot; and &quot;public education&quot; is beyond naive. Of course, if you&#x27;re lucky, you can align your interest with a competing group and suppress opposing group&#x27;s interests for a time. But that would not give you any power - it would just redistribute the power between the two groups. As long as you agree that the power should belong to the regulatory bodies, you would have them to be controlled by major industry players, partially or completely. You can say feel-good things like &quot;public education&quot; all day long, but you&#x27;d have to wake up and face the reality one day - and the reality is that regulatory capture is an inevitable consequence of powerful regulation in a big industry.",1388435612

Back then, there was an entire generation that was smoking pot, although it was very recently deemed illegal.<p>It was a weird time. Most young people either smoked pot or knew somebody who did. There wasn&#x27;t much odd about them, although we were told that smoking pot was terrible. On the street, however, it was fairly obvious that this was an overreaction. To hear some folks talk, there was little difference between heroin and pot. That was obviously not true.<p>It took 50 years for common sense to get back into the system, and even now, when the change is starting, it might be another 10 or 20 years to fully reverse pot laws. I&#x27;m not a pot user, but I find this slowness-to-adapt to common sense amazing.<p>Unfortunately, the system isn&#x27;t just glacial in fixing bad laws -- it&#x27;s fairly quick to add new bad laws as we go along. TSA is the case in point. Just like the pot laws, we&#x27;re constantly told that there is a terrible danger out there that we need protection from, even though it&#x27;s blatantly obvious that this is an overreaction and power grab.

For example, Minesweeper in NP-hard. However, it is possible to solve many games of Minesweeper using simple deductive reasoning in polynomial time. This leads to the question of what is the average difficulty of a random game. My best attempt at formalizing this question is to imagine reducing every game with a polynomial time algorithm, then look at the complexity of the remaining games. The complexity of an original game of size n could be the average after you reduce all games of size n with your polynomial time algorithm. If this new complexity is sub exponential than it feels as if there is some sense in which the game is not often NP-hard.<p>A more concrete example that comes to mind is Haskell&#x27;s type inference. In general this type inference is NP-hard. However, there are algorithms that can solve it in polynomial time assuming a limit to nesting. Because no such limit actually exists, type inference is still exponential. But, because we never see arbitrarily deep nesting (except for contrived examples), this does not matter.",1388434930

But nine tenths of good language design is coming up with good abstractions, and good abstractions always involve some conflation. And from a software engineering perspective I can see some good reasons for this choice.<p>One is that it creates some predictability around how errors will be handled.  As a producer of components, I know that within this component I have to accept that certain classes of error will always cause a fast failure, and other classes of error should be handled as immediately and gracefully as possible.  Compared to the mishmash of different error handling philosophies that I currently encounter when working on different components, this seems like it might be a welcome improvement even if it isn&#x27;t a complete solution.<p>As a consumer of components, I think it&#x27;s even better because it enforces still stronger predictability.  I get a couple nice guarantees out of this.  One is that critical failures bringing the whole component down means I encounter fewer situations where I&#x27;m unsure whether the overall application is in a consistent state, because 3rd-party component developers have fewer opportunities to do weird things with exceptions.  The other is that I can always defend against critical failures in 3rd-party components bringing down the whole application.  That isn&#x27;t always easy to do in vanilla C#, where FailFast exceptions always bring down the house and the best defense against that is to resort to the hassle of process-level isolation.  For systems programming I imagine such measures are even more irritating, since process-level isolation creates performance overhead.",1388434168

I had this to some degree at the public school I went to in Louisiana, where there were gifted programs.

I walked up to Miss Rouselle’s desk, and she asked, “What do you like to do?” I was like, I’m seven years old—shouldn’t you be telling me what to do? But I said, “I like to draw. I like puzzles.” She said, “OK, have you used oil paints? Have you done Mind Benders?” Soon I looked forward to that hour more than I did to spending the night at my friend’s house.

This will help you grow. I guess you&#x27;ve posted this for constructive criticism. You should look at challenging yourself further by finding a problem area that you are passionate about and digging deep into the data structures and the algorithms. Consider when I was 15. I was fascinated with computer graphics and games and wrote a raytracer in C, wrote a doom-like game-engine in pascal. Writing the game logic was always the easy part, dealing with limited memory and optimising for hardware were always a problem. My mates were all building their own graphics engines, dabbling with operating systems development and one kid was playing around with Classes and tree like data structures. We looked at him like he was a god.  This isn&#x27;t a put down but a push. You can do so much more kid and you have a good headstart but try something harder. Post your work here and most will be glad to give a helping hand. Ironically the most talented of us ended up being a musician when he left for University.",1388433665

6986535,comment,6973596,6973596,1,0,void0,,,"I smoke every day medically as it helps with managing the daily nausea, vomiting, and cramping pain that my IBS presents me. I am very young for most software engineers in my field, and I work at a startup that was recently funded. Before I started smoking daily, I was missing loads of work because of pain. Now, I wake up early every morning to smoke so that I can actually function. Marijuana has not improved my skills as a hacker, but it has enabled me to spend more of my life doing what I&#x27;d like to be (programming) instead of dealing with a disease. I can vouch for the therapeutic effects of the drug too, and I know that for some people it is what they need to get things done. In moderate amounts, I don&#x27;t know how it is fair to say that drugs like Prozac and Riddlin are acceptable for the workplace any more than pot.",1388433614

The airports in Finland and Denmark are generally pretty fast at getting people through security, maybe because of pretty low volume.",1388433600

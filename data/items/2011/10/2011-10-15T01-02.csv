Count from the thumb, then when both hands are full, at 30, drop the left hand thumb. This is strong IMO as counting to 5 on one hand is quick and easy. Though I've only used this a couple of times.<p>I know some BSL too which means I can count to 19 using different hand gestures of one hand (my right) quite readily. Using that with the above method of holding the higher placed digit gives me a count of 200 that I can work with much more easily than using binary.

3113713,comment,3113263,3113263,22,0,Abundnce10,,,"At some point during my college career I learned about the Rat Race and was propelled to discard my desire to climb the corporate ladder and decided to live a life similar to jfoucher (How I live on $7000 per year).  However, after living frugally for a couple years I saved up enough money and decided to travel the world.  Fast forward to today - after witnessing first hand the lives of those less fortunate while traveling in SE Asia I realized how self-centered I was to sit out of the ""Rat Race"" and meander along the road of my meager existence while there were other people wishing they had the knowledge, opportunity, and capacity to live and succeed in our society.  There are people all over this planet that don't possess the means necessary to make impactful changes in others' lives, let alone their own, and so I asked myself:  What if I took my determination and drive (clearly demonstrated in my previously frugal lifestyle habits) and applied those characteristics to actions that might benefit other people?  Would those actions then be better, or more worthy, than the actions of squeaking out a living on $7,000?  Personally, I decided they would be and have since then devoted myself to helping bring about change in this world.<p>I'm not saying everyone should view their life this way, but I understand what the author is describing and I have went through the internal struggle of trying to decide what to do with my life.  Recently, I decided to go back into the world of the Rat Race and try to make the lives of those around me and myself better (building interesting software, spreading joy and wisdom, raising awareness of certain issues, etc.).  I don't unconsciously spend money on things I don't need but I do if it deems fit.  More over, I don't think you need to have a garden or be a homebody to live frugally.<p>I hope other smart, determined people don't take the route of sitting idly by the side as hoards of unaware, materialistic consumers perpetuate a system of greed and excess.",1318643584

Those are orthogonal to each other<p>You can have a better UI and experience in a closed system. Multiple reasons:<p>1) A closed system is more tightly controlled. The user cannot fuck every aspect of it, and so he wont. You cannot assume the average users knows what he is doing or what he is installing on his device. Historically he has been shown unable to do so. This is why even stuff like Nigerian scams (something anybody on HN would laugh off), are successful against the general population.<p>2) ""Design by committee"" has not historically produced a good end user experience, and this is not by accident. Good UI design needs people to understand UI design and be able to say ""no"". And an OSS project is design by committee --it's very difficult to fence the UI from clueless people wanting to add the ""kitchen sink"", say.

trying to upgrade to an iPhone 4S this morning and I'd like to share
the story so nobody else suffers the same fate.<p>I've had the same phone number since 1998. I've bounced between
different carriers, corporate accounts and back to accounts owned by
me. Along the way I've never had any issues as a result of maintaining
the same number. A month ago I resigned from a job. Upon leaving I was
asked to return the corporate phone I was provided when I started.
Since the company had purchased the phone this seemed reasonable.
Since I transfered my longtime phone number over to the company when
they provided me with my corporate phone I requested upon my
resignation that they let me reclaim ownership of the number. Of
course they had no problem with this and said I was free to pick any
carrier I would like and they would pay any fees required, which I
though was a nice gesture.<p>This is where my story gets interesting. I drive to my local Verizon
store and ask them to reclaim ownership of my number. They inform me
that has to be done via phone and ask me to call customer service, so
I walk into the parking lot and sit on hold. After a nice long wait in
a Verizon store parking lot I finally get a customer service agent and
I explain I need to transfer ownership of a number from a corporate
account to a new personal account and I make clear that my number one
priority is ensuring that I can hold off on getting a new phone for
two weeks so when the new iPhone comes out I can use my upgrade then
rather than immediately. The customer service agent tells me that will
be no problem at all and then signs me up for a new two year contract.
All seems well. I wander back into the Verizon store because I need
them to deactivate my company phone, so I can mail it back, and
reactivate and OLD Blackberry I had to hold me over for two weeks
until the iPhone is released. As the young lady is enabling my old
BlackBerry she casually informs me that I'm lucky I owned this old
phone because I'm not eligible for an upgrade until July. This is very
confusing to me because I've just activated a new contract and have no
phone - plus I've just been told I could use my upgrade in two weeks.
I ask her why I wouldn't be eligible until July. She informs me I'm
not eligible for upgrade because the phone number was associated with
a phone upgrade less than a year prior. I am, not surprisingly I hope,
very upset about this because not only am I being told I can't get an
iPhone I'm being told I can't get ANY phone until July because a phone
upgrade was provided to a corporate contract that my number was
associated with, but that was not owned by me.<p>At this point I walk back into the parking lot and call customer
service again and ask them if what I have been told is correct. I then
explain that just minutes earlier I had been told I could use the
upgrade associated with my new contract on an iPhone. I also explain
that I didn't own the previous (corporate) phone and couldn't keep it
even if I had wanted to. The customer service agent talked to his
manager and they both agreed this made no sense and said they could
approve phone upgrade for me and would add a note to my account. More
troubling, nobody can explain this policy to me. I can come up with no
sane reason that phone upgrades would be associated with phone numbers
and not contracts. It's the agreement to remain a customer for two
years (and obviously offset the cost of the phone) that makes the
upgrades fiscally possible. What does what phone number is associated
with the contract have to do with this. The customer service agent
also confirms if I had done everything exactly the same, but not
immediately be eligible for a phone upgrade.<p>That brings us to today. I wait in line to get my iPhone and of course
when I get in they have no record of the second conversation I had
with customer service two weeks ago and they tell me I can't upgrade
until July. I go through the entire story out in the same parking lot
and again I'm told I can get any phone upgrade except to the new
iPhone 4S because it's an ""iconic"" device. In the end they reset my
upgrade date from July to Nov 9. I have no idea why Nov 9 and
obviously I can wait three weeks to get my iPhone, but i think it's a
great example of terrible customer service. And I hope people realize
that phone upgrades appear to be associated with phone numbers rather
than contracts. Again, of the five or six people I've had to deal with
about this over two weeks nobody can explain this policy to me. This might be common knowledge, but between being signed up for a new contract over the phone with no terms of service and just using common sense to arrive at the conclusion that I would be treated the same whether I signed up for a new contract with a new number or transferred a number from a completely different legal entity.<p>Anyway, I was hoping you guys might be nice enough to help me spread the word to the masses.",1318640483

This is often how it works currently, in practice, in my limited experience; you mail the authors and ask them to help you track down the problem, and get either code, or support; but I acknowledge this wont always work.<p>My concerns are that 
1) I don't trust people to do the hard thing, and re-implement to replicate, rather than take the easier way, and just use the code that's provided.  There's very little credit currently given for replicating existing (even recent) results.<p>2) More importantly, when replicating a paper, thats a little vague, it'll be more and more tempting to just peek at the source; and suddenly the paper isn't the document of record anymore.
I feel that if we go down the route where the code becomes the detailed documentation of the scientific process, that's a very fundamental shift from the current model, where the paper is supposed to be repeatable, in and of itself.<p>If we go down that road, we probably need a whole different review infrastructure; are reviewers really going to spend the time to review large and hastily written scientific codebases?<p>I doubt it; so how does review work when: ""The code is the only definitive expression of the data-processing methods used: without the code, readers cannot fully consider, criticize, or improve upon the methods.""
Will it no longer be possible to criticise a paper for lacking sufficient detail to reproduce the results?  Will the reply be 'read the source' ?<p>Maybe that's just the way things are going to go.  There's a lot to like in that manifesto.  But there's going to positive and negatives to letting the source become the documentation.  The discussion around the manifesto on their website does not acknowledge such tradeoffs; its taking a pretty one-sided view.

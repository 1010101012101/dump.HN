You could keep the code in one place and the only thing you&#x27;d need to tweak would be the chunking. (You could also layer in some DevOps on top of that where certain pieces would talk to other pieces on a schedule, or across a wire, and that could be specified in the code.

Aging is prejudicial to the individual, and evolutionary forces should prevent it, but many species show signs of senescence as individuals age. Here, I will propose a model for aging based on assumptions that are compatible with evolutionary theory: i) competition is between individuals; ii) there is some degree of locality, so quite often competition will be between parents and their progeny; iii) optimal conditions are not stationary, and mutation helps each species to keep competitive. When conditions change, a senescent species can drive immortal competitors to extinction. This counter-intuitive result arises from the pruning caused by the death of elder individuals. When there is change and mutation, each generation is slightly better adapted to the new conditions, but some older individuals survive by chance. Senescence can eliminate those from the genetic pool. Even though individual selection forces can sometimes win over group selection ones, it is not exactly the individual that is selected but its lineage. While senescence damages the individuals and has an evolutionary cost, it has a benefit of its own. It allows each lineage to adapt faster to changing conditions. We age because the world changes.&quot;",1400668479

If you are going to go MVC, go with Rails. If we are looking for an alternative to Rails, then we are probably looking for an alternative to MVC, and none of these mentioned choices fit the bill.<p>I wonder when the day will come that we finally get sick of recreating all the libraries that typically go into an MVC framework. That day, Rails will still be going strong and we will probably give up and just go with Rails.<p>Of all the choices mentioned, not many have been around as long as Rails. For every day that Rails survives, the stronger it becomes. The more likely it will continue while the alternatives shrivel.<p>One day MVC may become obsolete, but some people might still want to use an MVC framework for whatever reason. That day, Rails will be there waiting for you.<p>Years ago, I watched the video on how to build a blog in 10(?) minutes. Today, I can still somewhat follow that video. With many of the MVC frameworks in this list, you couldn&#x27;t do that. ZF1 is not ZF2 for example. The framework was completely changed. They might as well call ZF2 by a different name. If it were called anything more interesting than &quot;Zend Framework&quot; then maybe it would have a different name.<p>Go is interesting, but the MVC web framework ecosystem has to be created, just like we did for Node. I don&#x27;t even know if that will happen anytime, or ever. Maybe people are getting sick of doing that. And then you need to wait X years to see if something actually has any lasting power.<p>Screw it, just go with Rails.<p>Or Django. ;)",1400667101

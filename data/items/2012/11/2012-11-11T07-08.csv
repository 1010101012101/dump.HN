I was delighted as they are known for paying attention to the everyday aspects of running a business & being open about it. (It was actually my 2nd time applying & interviewing with them. I didn't hear back that time either, having had a Skype interviewed with the founders).<p>However, I was more than disappointed that after two interviews with staff members, personality test and contact from the CEO that I was in the final shortlist - a month long process - I never heard back again. The only way I knew I hadn't been hired was once the new hire was announced on the company blog.<p>Between the creative application they'd asked for, interviews & tests, I'd put in a couple of full days of work. Being rejected would have been fine, understandable, but never letting me know was disrespectful & goes against the culture they project.<p>A few weeks later, the same company advertised the exact same position again on their blog, as I believe they wanted even more coverage than the first person they hired. I decided not to apply that time.<p>All in all, a simple 2 line email thanking me for the effort and letting me know would have sufficed. Over a month of waiting for an email to drop was painful.",1352620300

Firm X was not the only firm not to extend an offer, but it was the only firm which never contacted me again after the in-office interview round.<p>Last fall, a foreign middle-market client (between $10m and $500m in assets) needed a US-based law firm for an m&a deal.  Not a very large deal (relatively speaking) but it was an 8-figure deal that led to other 8-figure deals, with very good realization.  The client was trying to choose between Firm X and several other firms; Firm X was their top choice simply because they'd heard of it.  I told the client about my experiences with Firm X and speculated as to the quality of service they would receive as a middle-market client.  The client dropped Firm X from their consideration list and went with another firm.<p>Not sending a free email or $0.35 letter cost Firm X several million in fees.",1352620124

I actually use Slim(slim > haml) or Haml, but they are just syntactic sugar.<p>Enlive, on one hand, allows designers to work on html which doesn't need any data binding, and then process the plain html. On the other hand, it's tightly coupled with the markup. A designer can't be sure that changing a class name or restructuring the markup won't break the templates.<p>Rolling your own validations might be fun, or it isn't something I want to do when I am working on a project. I might have rolled out validations from last project which I can re-use, but I still prefer AR or WTForm validation over rolling my own(takes time, and if I am in a hurry, ends up not being generic enough to use in another project).

They used to be like businesses: highly patronage-driven. And they still are, due to legacy applicants.<p>But we're operating on a broken premise. Organized and polite recruiting does not correlate with meritocracy. Ask the Soviet Union or universities.

I wish there was some kind of metrics based on feedback attached to my profile, so that after interviews, I'd bounce to that perfect position, as ""one man's trash is another man's treasure"".<p>Best rejection letter I got so far:<p>""We're sorry to say we couldn't accept you for a position at XXX. Please don't take it personally, it was a hard decision. The applications we receive get better every day, and since there's a limit on the number positions, we have to turn away a lot of genuinely promising people.<p>Another reason you shouldn't take this personally is that we know we make lots of mistakes.<p>We're trying to get better at this, but the hard limit on the number of people we hire means it's practically certain that people we rejected will go on to do something amazing.

I think there are enough people who are technically minded (no even necessarily developers) and currently use OSX because its a UNIX system that ""just works"" and can also run popular commerical software (MS Office and Adobe CS mostly). The day Apple does this I and others will need to buy computers from somewhere else  I think there's room for a company to fill that role.",1352617650

4768957,comment,4768789,4768842,7,0,anon987,,,"> While I agree that it is the decent thing to do, the whole '' Reply>Copy>Paste>Send. 5 seconds.' is probably not entirely accurate. Many organizations spend weeks going through hundreds of applications before contacting the candidates that they are interested in.<p>I think the stories about effort required to look at applicants is a load of hooey and is an excuse to make HR departments and managers seem busy.  It's very hard for for me to believe that a hiring manager has to eyeball a resume for more than a minute to see if the candidate goes in the ""maybe"" pile or the ""no"" pile, and no more than 5 minutes to take a good look at each resume in the ""maybe"" pile and continue to subdivide from there (each division would take more time to look at the meat of the resume).  I seriously doubt even huge organizations like Google have humans look at hundreds of resumes for a single position.<p>The absence of reply is human nature: No matter how nice you put it, you're actively rejecting them, and that's a hard thing to do.  When you think about all the times you've been rejected it's usually by being ignored whether it be a friend not picking up the phone, a girl not replying to the message you sent her on the dating site, or by an employee who pretends to not hear you.  Yes, it's painful at times, but much less painful than a verbal ""I don't want to talk to you.""<p>The other aspect is that by replying it initiates (or continues) an interaction.  HR employees or hiring managers would like to say ""thanks but no thanks"" but then the applicant will want to argue, make their case, beg, or in the worst situation get angry.<p>Another reason they don't send replies is because they want to keep their options open.  Sometimes their first pick declines the offer and it would be very awkward for them to send the letter and then come back and make you an offer, or even more awkward if the number one pick accepts, they send out the letters, then the number one pick backs out.<p>Companies should send the ""thanks but no thanks"" replies to everyone that the hiring company has responded to and they should send them from a ""no reply"" type address where replies are blackholed or deleted.<p>On a side note: With the explosion of technology HR is no longer qualified to screen technical resumes.  For almost every other profession it's easy to see who's qualified and who's not, but when you have a group of non-technical people dealing with thousands of technical terms and buzzwords they aren't qualified to make the decisions, and if they're simply matching keywords then they're an obstacle to the process and can be replaced by machines.  Yes, calling for machines to replace humans isn't pretty but in this day and age it's the way the world works and people in HR need to up their game.<p>> Also, in general, if you've applied and haven't heard anything back by the end of the week, it's probably safe to cross them off your list.<p>I send em and forget em, it's much less stress that way.<p>The only time you should actively pursue a position is when you have a direct line to the decision maker or their boss.  Recruiters are powerless because they can't ask for updates too often and are at the mercy of the hiring company.  Good luck getting someone in HR on the phone directly to make your case.  It's even harder to find out the name of the hiring manager when you're applying at a megacorp.<p>Find the decision maker if you want to pitch directly or to follow up, but if you can't, just spray and pray.",1352617558

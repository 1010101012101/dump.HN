My knowledge on what is and what isn't a startup is limited.<p>Notes on your definition:<p>You could exclude apple as an outlier by changing ""in the next few years"" to ""in the first few years"".<p>Concerning the significance of growing by a large factor; you might want to consider changing the absolute number to a recurring value. 500 users in the first year which turn into 5000 after five years is hardly significant. 500*5^5 = 1.562.500 is starting to feel significant.

It was a very hellish situaiton, but one thing that made it a lot worse was the sense that if I went to the authorities, I would be blamed for the attacks against me.

Would it be useful if they read some Wikipedia entries before they started writing legislation (or, perhaps more accurately, accepting legislation written for them by the MPAA)? Yes. Do they have to? No. They just need to accept that they should bring in experts, and have the experts sit and explain everything to them. They can ask questions and find things out. This is actually accepting that you are not knowledgable with everything, and this is OK.<p>What they have done is said ""No, we don't understand this stuff, because we're not socially-inept <i>nerds</i> like you <i>chortle chortle</i> and if we have you sit here, we'll have you say one thing, the guy from the MPAA say the opposite, and then we'll be right where we started and not know who to believe.

I think a lot of times we see a lot of hogwash coming out of that area and I think this is impossible to resolve because social justice theorists tend to deny basic aspects of human nature, despising sexuality (which is a necessary part of life), social divisions and hierarchy (socially necessary) and the like.<p>I think when we look at these things something more objective and less judgemental (like anthropology) is a better starting point.  I.e. it is better to criticize from a standpoint of functional understanding than from functional ignorance (seeing only portions of a dynamic that bother one and not seeing how something benefits the target group).<p>As far as the checklist, it's fairly rife with definitional problems (sexual harassment has a very narrow legal definition for example but I doubt that's what the blogger means, and even terms like rape are more and more frequently subject of definitional problems, as jurisdictions pass laws saying that drunken sex is rape regardless of how the intoxicant was administered).<p>Moreover I think one could turn this on it;s head and come up with a female privilege checklist too as unpopular as that would be (particularly important in areas of parenting, child support, and the like).",1324131293

It's faster by a few seconds than sending a text or calling the person and telling them.<p>Once you're in the missed call mindset, you see all kinds of situations where you can use it, but until you get in the mindset, the reflex will be to send a text or make a call.",1324130495

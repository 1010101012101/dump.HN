It doesn't do anything you don't want it to.<p>Seriously though, zsh is nice bash replacement. VLC is a great media player and Enlightenment is a nice GUI.<p>Actually, check out Etoile (etoileos.com) too; its a really nice GUI that's based off of OpenStep and its really pretty and usable.",1231087812

It is not a strictly atheist book, although you could read it as one if you tilt your head properly.<p>But how can you not know anything else about Carl Sagan?<p>He wrote many books popularizing science, including <i>Contact</i>, <i>The Dragons of Eden</i>, <i>Broca's Brain</i>, and <i>Cosmos</i>. He also co-wrote and hosted the series <i>Cosmos</i> on PBS, which is the most-watched PBS show in history, and well worth watching on DVD.<p>He was founder and first President of The Planetary Society (<a href=""http://www.planetary.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planetary.org/</a>). He was an avid supporter of SETI. He assembled the gold plaque that went into space on Pioneer 10, and the golden records that went out on the Voyager probes.<p>As an astronomer, he made several important hypotheses about the structure of other planets, particularly Venus, and drew connections between Venus and Earth-based global warming and greenhouse emissions.<p>He was active in investigating UFO claims, including serving on the Ad Hoc Committee that reviewed the Air Force's Project Blue Book. He was convinced of the probability of extra-terrestrial intelligence, but equally convinced that we had not encountered it yet.<p>Most importantly, he brought us the phrase ""billions and billions"", even though he never said it himself until long after it was a joke.<p>Here's a collection of quotations: <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan</a><p>And one for the road: <i>""If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.""</i>",1231085701

It's probably been down for a total of about 5 hours in that time.  It's never taken them more than 2 hours to respond to a support request.

He just released an excellent book on performance as well. He invented a ton of techniques on how to optimize the front and back-end performance of web apps. His team also created YSlow and they're actively supporting/working on Firebug.<p>Yahoo has released so much useful stuff and Steve and his team have been extremely generous. I hope this continues as he moves to Google.",1199154865

As for the Visa God worshippers, Ted Kennedy said this,<p><i>""The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs."" (U.S. Senate, Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization of the Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, D.C., Feb. 10, 1965. pp. 1-3.) </i><p>He might have added: <i>It will not cause a rush of mentally touched Pagans into our high technology sectors.</i>",1199154358

It stunk the first time I saw it.  I think that DHH admitted it was a bad idea in his RailsConf keynote, but I'm not sure if I remember correctly.<p>But the point is that just because it was a bad idea, doesn't mean Koz is categorically a bad developer, or that he's any of the things that Zed called him.  I heard him talk at RailsConf, and I have to admit that he sounded kind of like an egotist, but didn't actually know how to code all that well.  But do I call him a fat fucker?  No.  That's taking it a little too far.",1199153607
94048,comment,93888,93964,0,0,boucher,,,"""Their purpose is to make it harder to do bad things. Making it easier to do good things is not a requirement.""<p>That seems like a pretty silly set of expectations for a framework.  By virtue of making it easier to do things, you may eliminate a lot of bad things, but the goal really is to make it easier to do things.  This might seem like splitting hairs, but you split the hair here, and I disagree with the conclusion.",1199153326

2403346,comment,2403151,2403151,1,0,snagg,,,"I think this approach exposes a number of problems that are pretty relevant. 
First off vendors by decrypting the content of the researcher's submission are basically giving up vulnerabilities to the bad guys that want to target unpatched systems (read: what malware most of the time does). 
Second thing I see no reasons why the vulnerability disclosure process should change and migrate to SSL based encryption: vendors can already expose ""lies"" if they feel like it with PGP encryption and honestly having a ""middle-man"" in between that can potentially have sensible data looks like a bad idea. 
So how about: researchers post on the website the SHA-1 of the POC or just a line saying ""product X is vulnerable"", then the owner of the website asks the vendor for confirmation. If the researcher has no ""karma points"" then the submission is hold back until the vendor confirms, if the researcher has ""karma points"" (already multiple confirmed and valuable submissions) then the advisory gets published immediately regardless of whether the vendor acknowledges it or not. 
Still does it actually help anybody? how would you convince consumers to actually pick products or similar based on that website? 
To me it looks like the people interested in this kind of information have already other means (twitter, ml, direct contact with vendors), the others don't care.",1301853599

Now lots of people seem to be taking these specific practices as gospel, but they've missed the point: it's not that what works for someone else will necessarily work for you, but that some things can be changed that might not have occurred to you, perhaps yielding much better results. <obligatory> Also, just because 37 Signals and Mark Boulton have popular blogs, that doesn't actually prove them right. </obligatory><p>Mark's web site doesn't seem to have comments there any more, but I'm pretty sure I left one at the time pointing out that you <i>want</i> a typeset list to have a clear break between items (otherwise why are you typesetting it as a list?) and therefore hanging list markers the way you might hang punctuation seems exactly the opposite to what you are trying to achieve.<p>I would argue that the same series of articles makes the same mistake with hanging quotation marks, for the same reason. If you read some of the early thinking about hanging punctuation, the goal of this kind of microtypography was to give visually clean lines to the edges of where text is justified. If you position glyphs mechanically, as computer typesetting inevitably does by default, you actually get a visually uneven margin where you have glyphs that ""stick out"", such as quotation marks, dashes, and the crossbar on a captial T: the whitespace above and/or below the ""sticking out"" part breaks the straightness of the margin to a human eye. Instead, you can hang the glyph slightly (not necessarily entirely) in the margin, to give a line that is mathematically irregular but visually straight to the human eye.<p>Somehow this idea has transformed into hanging glyphs, usually punctuation marks, being some sort of trendy typographical effect, which might still make sense if you're talking about setting displayed type such as pull quotes. Unfortunately, it has then crossed a bridge too far, becoming ""this is the Right Way To Do It(TM)"" for even regular text, which is just dogma without any sort of aesthetic and/or usability justification.",1301851774

I'm not sure how important the extra problems that this solves are.<p><i>Yes, it allows a vendor to ""prove"" they fixed a vulnerability.</i> Perhaps if you're looking at vulnerability research as an outsider you think this is a significant issue. But it really isn't. If Chris Valasek or Tavis Ormandy say that (say) Adobe hasn't fixed their finding, everybody (including Adobe) will believe them. On the flip side, when Adobe fixes Valasek or Ormandy's bug, they're going to say that right away. Believe it or not, vulnerability researchers <i>like it</i> when vendors fix their bugs; it's part of how you keep score.<p>And even if you think proving vulnerabilities is a real issue, all this does is allow vendors to decide autonomously to prove something. But vendors don't need tools to do this, and neither do researchers. The real problem is that vendors sit on vulnerabilities for months or years; giving them one more (complicated) way to publish doesn't really help much. Meanwhile, the researcher can disclose any time she wants; she justs posts the exploit to Pastie or F-D. Done and done.<p><i>And yes, this creates a central location for customers to see outstanding security issues with products.</i> But Zed can do that right now without getting researchers to do anything differently. He can just follow security researchers on Twitter and RSS their blogs and wait for them to post things. Then he can create entries on his site. Charlie Miller even posts numbers, like, ""I have 193882 binned crashes in Quicktime and Apple has fixed none of them so far"". Some visualization tools might come in handy. It's less fun than crypto schemes, but probably more useful.<p>Also worth mentioning: there already are ""vulnerability arbitration centers"" that do exactly this. Also, they take over the project management with the vendor. Also, they publish formal advisories to alert the public. Also, they pay the researchers. Sometimes a lot. One of them is TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, which also runs the annual Pwn2Own contest at CanSecWest. Another is iDefense.<p><i>Finally, you can consider whether this addresses the problem of ""how do I communicate a vulnerability securely to a vendor"".</i> That is indeed a real problem and this is indeed a viable answer to that problem. But every vendor that has a vulnerability response process already has a secure channel for receiving reports. From spending the last 5+ years of my life communicating findings to vendors who <i>don't</i> have that process in place, let me assure you that ""secure channel"" is the least of your problems. Forget getting your email intercepted; worry more that your finding is going to end up in the vendor's public bug database tagged as a ""feature"" (seriously, go pick a slightly non-mainstream vendor with a public database and do searches for ""segmentation fault"" or even ""nessus"", as in ""bug: product crashes and reboots when nessus is run against it"").<p>---<p>If, as a vendor, you want to do something to streamline vulnerability reports, <i>run</i> - <i>do</i> - <i>not</i> - <i>walk</i> to create this web page on your site:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=804257"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=804257</a><p>I highly recommend you just crib from what 37signals did.<p>If you don't, and rely instead on the notion that a researcher could in theory use the RSA key in your SSL cert to send you a secure message, please bear in mind that many --- perhaps <i>most</i> --- researchers will interpret your lack of guidance on this as a license to simply publish your flaws directly on a mailing list.

2403231,comment,2402665,2402665,4,0,uscfan1781,,,"It's also important to understand how the internship dynamics change as you  progress through the four years of college. Getting a paid internship after your freshmen or sophomore year is extremely difficult. Very few large, ""name brand"" companies include freshman and sophomores in their internship programs. Those that do typically have ratios along the lines of 90% juniors, 10% freshman and sophomores.<p>The catch is that landing the junior year internship in large part depends on having at least one previous relevant internship. That leaves most freshman and sophomores struggling to find internships at local businesses in their field of interest. Most of the businesses don't have an actual internship program, have no idea what to do with an intern, and don't have the money to pay one even if they wanted to.<p>This describes the experience of me and 95% of my friends at Duke over the last 4 years. Many of us have awesome, extremely high paying jobs lined up after graduation, but we got those jobs as a more or less direct result of working for free after freshman or sophomore year.<p>My personal experience:
Freshman summer: part-time job to support myself, took a summer class, did a lot of (free) work for Duke Student Government
Sophomore summer: 3/4 time job as a waiter in a restaurant to support myself. Spent all my free time programming.
Junior summer: awesome internship at Microsoft.
Post-grad: offers from Google and Microsoft, trying to start my own company.<p>Basically over the past 20 months or so my pay has gone from ~$6/hr part-time, to ~$75 full time. Trust me, I am not 12-13x smarter, more valuable, or more skilled now than 2 years ago. The system is broken.<p>Although I never had an unpaid internship my ability to land a paying one after junior year was dependent on the projects I worked on in my free time the previous summer. And that is in the tech industry, which is in by far the best shape. The internship situation in other field (as SandBOx mentioned) is much, much worse.",1301851321

If the community values what they contributed, this might be an opportunity to consider what the remaining members wish to do to create something of value which can draw the interest of high quality members.

Both urandom and random (on Linux; there's no difference between the two on BSD) are seeded from hard entropy sources. Both urandom and random extract entropy by updating pools with SHA1. The difference is that random has an estimator and will demand <i>more</i> hard entropy when it has serviced too many requests. But it's not as if urandom goes from producing ""101010100101000101010100111001"" to ""111011011110111101111111110111"" when entropy is depleted.<p>In any case, this is entirely irrelevant to the discussion at hand. You can absolutely use /dev/urandom to make a one-shot crypto key. You shouldn't wire /dev/urandom up into an online cryptosystem (don't use it to produce DH parameters, for instance), but even then, urandom isn't going to be how your system really gets broken.<p>In your case, experimenting with encrypting whole files with RSA instead of using RSA to exchange keys is what's really going to break your system.

2844465,comment,2844059,2844417,34,0,rayiner,,,"> How does finance destroy the broader economy in general? Liquid functional capital markets are critical for a stable economy. Finance is only bad for the economy when incentives are structures so that government limits the downside.<p>False dichotomy. The article talks about the current financial system in the US hurting the economy. It's not suggesting dismantling the financial system in general.<p>Step back for a moment. The financial industry is infrastructure. It's there to grease the wheels of productive industry. It facilitates growth, but cannot in itself create that growth. Now, last year the financial industry accounted for something like 1/3 of corporate profits. It's gotten absolutely immense. Do we need such massive institutions just to create ""liquid functional capital markets?"" Are these companies so profitable because they're really creating enormous amounts of value for the economy, or because being close to the money makes it easier to justify taking a percentage cut of the money flowing through the system?<p>Now, I'm not attacking them just because they're profitable. But to an extent they're profitable because the benefit tremendously from government protection. When Apple innovates and sells iPhones, they pay 35% tax on those profits, but when a trader at Goldman moves money around to make profits, they pay less than half that in taxes. If we believe that tax rates create incentive structures, does it really make sense to incentivize the latter so much more  heavily than the former?",1312430125

2844460,comment,2843715,2843715,86,0,gswang,,,"Whoa, stop. There's a lot of issues in this article. First of all, Berkeley is NOT getting rid of SICP and SICP ideas. This is flat out untrue.<p>I'm a recent instructor for the course, and I've spoken to several TA's about this course. Below is a rough summary of what we've discussed. This should not be construed as the ""official line"", but take from it what you will.<p>First, Berkeley are not getting rid of SICP. \u200EFor those who aren't aware, they (the future TA's/instructors) are making lecture notes based on SICP but using Python 3).<p>From a TA:\nAt the end of the day most of the reason for moving to Python (beyond the weak argument that it's a bigger community), is that there was a meeting where they realized that nobody wanted to teach the course in Scheme after Brian retires. I'm not burning him at the stake, I read his argument and I've considered it. All I'm saying is that he has bad information. Also, lambda is cool but the only difference between that and defining a function inside the body of another function is the requirement of a name. I know lambda's amazing and it's not nearly as magical when you do it in Python, but Python supports proper closures which is the real reason lambda in Scheme is so powerful.<p>A different TA:\nBut the real reason it's not being taught in Scheme? My understanding is that it's not being taught is because no professor wants to teach it in Scheme.<p>Secondly, we talked about some concerns about whether SICP is actually a good INTRODUCTION. I don't think we dispute that there's a huge value in the course, but whether it's good for an introduction is I think, debatable<p>I do know that when I was a student, I raised many of these same concerns and frankly, I dont think those concerns are invalid. I think that until you have an appreciation for mathematical elegance and REALLY REALLY understand SICP, which appears to only be true for less than half of the students, much of it is lost. I know that was the case when I took the class, at least.<p>Should clarify. I'm not saying that 50% of the class ""doesn't get it"", but there's a deeper level that I think is hard to grasp for people who either don't spend 40 hours a week on this, or don't have a mathematical background.<p>Good example: Data directed programming. Me as a student was: WTF is this? So I always just call this 'get-data' function? What's the point? Where's the application?<p>The examples in Scheme are often /SO SIMPLE/ that exercises seem like they are dumb. They often look like a point docking trap in exams to students.<p>In my mind, SICP is better as a capstone, senior course. Think about all of us who defend it. Do we think that we could reach a better audience with that message if the audience were seniors looking for a summary/enlightenment, rather than freshmen exploring CS and engineering applications?<p>Here's an interesting direction to take SICP: <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses\u200B/electrical-engineering-an\u200Bd-computer-science/6-945-a\u200Bdventures-in-advanced-symb\u200Bolic-programming-spring-20\u200B09/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses\u200B/electrical-engineering-an\u200Bd-comp...</a><p>Correct me if I'm mistaken, but my understanding is that this is essentially SICP if they were to teach a graduate-version of the course. This looked /insanely/ cool.<p>In any case, for future TAs and Instructors of this course: \nIt is now up to you to make sure the spirit of SICP and CS education lives on! Not that it's been any different since the beginning of time.",1312430035

A simpler way to analyze this problem is noticing the f(n-3) term implies your function has to memorize up to 3 previous results. Then just use the coefficients from the formula to cycle the next result into memory.

It is basically an investment manager complaining that the wealthiest Americans are mostly in finance and don't pay enough taxes because most of their earnings are from capital gains.  He makes a lot of presuppositions in his writing that he never defends.  For example:<p>""I asked if her colleagues talked about or understood how much damage was created in the broader economy from their activities.""<p>How does finance destroy the broader economy in general? Liquid functional capital markets are critical for a stable economy.  Finance is only bad for the economy when incentives are structures so that government limits the downside.<p>""America's top corporations reported 31% profit growth and a 31% reduction in taxes, the latter due to profit outsourcing to low tax rate countries.""<p>Outsourcing is not bad.  He treats it like it is a dirty world. Companies should have work done where it is most efficient.  Google comparative advantage.\n""It wasn't the hard-working 99.5%""<p>Because the top .5% aren't hard working.<p>""In my view, the American dream of striking it rich is merely a well-marketed fantasy that keeps the bottom 99.5% hoping for better and prevents social and political instability. The odds of getting into that top 0.5% are very slim and the door is kept firmly shut by those within it.""<p>By definition, the odds of getting into the top .5% have to be very slim because only .5% of the population can get in there.<p>Also, I should note that the lower 99.5% benefit from lower capital gains taxes when it comes to appreciation on their homes.  Obviously, this hasn't been a benefit lately.  But, this is important given that the home constitutes the biggest chunk of net worth for many families.",1312429143

The picture is clear; entry into the top 0.5% and, particularly, the top 0.1% is usually the result of some association with the financial industry and its creations. I find it questionable as to whether the majority in this group actually adds value or simply diverts value from the US economy and business into its pockets and the pockets of the uber-wealthy who hire them.</i><p>This paragraph ruffled my feathers quite a bit. It's overreaching to say that a programmer who managed to make out like a bandit when their company hit it big is just ""diverting value from the US economy"".

It allows them to protect and increase their wealth and significantly affect the U.S. political and legislative processes. They have real power and real wealth. Ordinary citizens in the bottom 99.9% are largely not aware of these systems, do not understand how they work, are unlikely to participate in them, and have little likelihood of entering the top 0.5%, much less the top 0.1%. Moreover, those at the very top have no incentive whatsoever for revealing or changing the rules.</i><p>In other words - the alleged problem is that you can't fix this tax stuff even if you wanted to because the people in control are the ones benefiting (and most other people aren't aware / don't care enough).<p>I'm not taking a position either way, just clarifying what the author is saying.",1312427442

84462,comment,84355,84452,0,0,dreish,,,"That's not a very effective defense of domain squatting.  The idealistic sex educator should just as rationally say, ""I'm not making $1.5m off this site, so I should accept that bid and sell it, and use the money to get my important message out some other more efficient way.""<p>The domain squatter serves no beneficial function at all to society, so nothing is lost by banning that behavior except a sliver of economic freedom.  If economic freedom is a very high priority for you, of course you're going to be against regulating the registration of domain names.  You're entitled to your principles, but don't expect everyone else to share them.<p>",1196293321

Why would the releases [0],[1] be minified? I would have thought the source would be untouched.

It's obvious to me (and you) that sex.com is worth more than american-rivet-supply-corporation.net, but the question of <i>how much</i> more the first is worth is one that should have ramifications -- for example, if sex.com just goes to the first person to register it, it may end up as a popular, disappointing sexual education site -- if it goes to whoever pays the most, it's going to do whatever earns the most.<p>If someone else has a better use for octopart.cn, they'll buy it; if the Octoparts are the best possible users, they'll pay for it. If octopart.cn is worth more than X, where X is what they pay to get it, they're still ahead (just less so than they could be). If not, octopart.cn is overpriced from their perspective, and will end up going to whoever thinks it's cheap.",1196291695

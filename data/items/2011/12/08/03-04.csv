3327568,comment,3327232,3327232,5,0,zohebv,,,"Interesting post. However, I think the primary consequence of driverless cars could be more mundane - everyone will end up using cabs/taxis far more often. This is the life I lived in Bombay a decade ago. The parking, cost overhead of a car is so high and rickshaws/cabs are so cheaply and plentifully available, that walking out of your home and hailing a cab to go wherever you want is the best option.<p>Cabs in the West are expensive because drivers need to be paid more and cartels are at work. If both these costs are eliminated then what works in a country like India is, suddenly, the best option for commuters in the West. Realtime pooling of cab passengers is a possibility, a traveler could be offered a choice of picking a co-traveler for a reduction in fare(or even cash back!) when already travelling in the car.<p>Families could still own cars, but they will probably pay for insurance on a per-mile basis, rather than a per-month basis, so that the incremental cost of owning a car is minimal. Effectively, you end up owning a cab that only you use and pay cab fare to the insurance company :-) The ratio of cabs to private cars would then be an interplay of insurance costs/parking costs and ride sharing benefits, with cities leaning towards cabs to escape parking costs. So, things wouldn't be too different :-)<p>One unfortunate consequence could be the increase in suburban sprawl and traffic congestion with driverless cars as people start caring lesser about longer commute times. Automated cars will probably be better behaved in traffic, but the road capacity will be pushed to its limits.",1323316760

The first wave of these will be bought in small part by early adopting owners but more likely by small-time transit / freight companies looking to save a buck.<p>Once it's a proven small-scale model, larger transit and freight systems will start using them; I'd expect ZipCar and Uber and similar services to jump on it. At this time, more and more people would be buying their own driverless car.<p>Now picture 20 years down the road. You're a young person who can't afford a car. Do you get a job to pay to buy a car, or do you use a service like ZipCar? Fast forward 5 years, you've got a job and you could afford a car. Do you buy one to give you ""added convenience""? That's what ZipCar will have to beat. If they can get a car to you by the time you're outside your house, they are actually beating personally owned vehicles, and the closer to that they get, the less likely it is people will purchase vehicles.",1323316700

The economics of electric cars and parking.<p>Initially it seems that they will fix the parking problem - driverless cars can be sent to park outside the CBD, reducing traffic and freeing up space.<p>But the problem is that people/software will optimize for <i>price</i>, and for electric cars the cheapest scenario is for them to be stuck in a traffic jam on a public road.<p>Instead of going to a parking bay, the software will route them to the nearest traffic jam, where the car can sit with the electric motors off for a large amount of time. Inevitably, some software will misjudge how long their charge will last, their batteries will run flat and the traffic jam will get worse.<p>As far as I can see the only way around this is to increase the cost of being on the road.",1323316345

We'll see.<p>> As far as I'm aware, all modern graphics cards allow you to render the depth buffer to texture just like the color buffer.\nNot quite. You can render the z value to a texture, but that is done in the pixelshader and do not touch the hardware z-buffer used for z-fail/z-pass tests. It is this hardware z-buffer that is inaccessible, as it shares it memory with the stencil buffer which is used for stencil tests. Hence the proprietary format.<p>No need for the internal format, though -- raw depth buffers are A-OK.<p>> As you can see, the bit depth restriction means that you would end up with 2x bandwidth usage with the z based edge detector, especially on the older hardware where you do not have the bandwidth to spare. It would be a different case if you can sample the hardware z-buffer.<p>One thing to keep in mind is that yes, you're rendering it to texture and you incur <i>some</i> overhead there, but you don't have to pull that data back to the CPU so you're dependent on bandwidth between the GPU and its memory, not main memory.  Sure, it's double the memory used there, but that's negligible from a bandwidth perspective.  Also a good thing to note that you generally already have your depth buffer if you're doing deferred rendering, and you can do all the AA based on that, in theory.",1323315101

3327431,comment,3327085,3327253,13,0,mbell,,,"As someone who has spent a fair deal of time in the audio world both professionally and independently I'm pretty confused by this post.<p>The primary reason to oversample in the audio world is two fold:<p>1) To avoid aliasing, which is a somewhat different issue from graphical aliasing.  ADC conversion creates aliases of the primary signal lower in the frequency band.  For example if we sample at 40khz we can resolve signals up to 20khz.  If the input contains content higher than this frequency it will alias into the pass band.<p>For example a 24khz tone on the input would appear as a 16 khz tone, a 28khz tone would appear as a 12khz tone, all higher frequency content will mirror around the Nyquist-Shannon point.  Now if it were possible to build a ""brick wall"" filter, that is. completely block anything above the Nyquist-Shannon point and completely pass everything under this point, there would be no issue.  But, in practice, this type of filtering isn't possible.  As a result if your sampling at 48khz and you want to accurately convert all content up to 20khz you have to play a balancing act.  You either provided flat response to 20khz and accept that some aliasing will make it through, or deal with some reduced level(roll off) at the higher end of your desired spectrum and block all audible aliasing.<p>This is really the primary reason for oversampling for high fidelity content as we can push the anti-aliasing filter well above the audible spectrum, allowing us to get both flat response to 20khz and block all audible aliasing.  It should also be said that this issue is becoming less and less and issue as ADC/DACs are now implementing digital filters which can get far closer to the ideal 'brick wall' than is reasonable with analog filtering.<p>2) At a deeper level, oversampling increases resolution.  Note that resolution here means actual resolution, that is bit depth, which is in opposition to the use of the term in the parent post.  An example would be modern Sigma-Delta ADC/DACs.<p>Its common to use a low resolution part, maybe only 1-4 bits and oversample at a higher rate.  For example, if your target output is 48khz @ 24 bits, you can use a 20 bit ADC and sample at ~12.28Mhz and downsample (internally within the ADC/DAC, really just averaging) to get your desired output.  In practice a part may only operate on 1-4 bits but sample, much, much faster to get the desired resolution.<p>As for upsampling for the purpose of signal processing, there are a limited number of algorithms where this is useful and upsampling in and of itself introduces issues that have to be dealt with.  The reason for upsampling tends to have more to do with processing accuracy limitations created by computation than anything else.  For example bi-quad filter coefficients at very low frequency, say 5-8hz can exhaust the available resolution of a 32bit float at 48khz where as it may be completely fine at 192khz.  This can be an issue with a sub-sonic filter in a subwoofer for instance.",1323314483

While techniques like FXAA are needed for deferred rendering due to the order of operations, I don't see why FXAA isn't acceptable on non-deferred renderers.<p>FXAA is acceptable for the other techniques as well. However, MSAA is, in my opinion, a better technique as it uses supersampling at the edges and is already hardware assisted. FXAA's strength is that it is less expensive than MSAA memory and bandwidth wise. Both are a premium in deferred shading as you are using a 4x RBGA16 texture render target or something close to it :)<p>> If you have two planes at a right angle to each other, you'd see that in the depth buffer. Imagine you're looking at a line of pixels and you're doing this on each pixel -- you'd look to see if the pixels on either side of the one you're on are trending in opposite directions from the current one, and know it's an edge.<p>The question is can you get reliable edge detection with less number of texture look-ups on the z-buffer versus the RBG based edge detection?<p>> As far as I'm aware, all modern graphics cards allow you to render the depth buffer to texture just like the color buffer.<p>Not quite. You can render the z value to a texture, but that is done in the pixelshader and do not touch the hardware z-buffer used for z-fail/z-pass tests. It is this hardware z-buffer that is inaccessible, as it shares it memory with the stencil buffer which is used for stencil tests.

I just hate to see that mindless crap trickle down into one of the last semi-sane distros (debian).

If it's the norm to pay for a share in a fleet of cars, then those cars will probably be owned and managed by a company that will ensure that they get timely preventive maintenance.

The wonderful illustration here is that after billions of dollars and millions of lives we realized we were wrong?  What system <i>couldn't</i> do that?<p>To me, what this actually illustrates is the mistaken way we use science today:<p>Today: ""Ok, it looks like it's probably fat that's bad.  Ok, everyone!  No more fat""<p>And everyone laughs and points at all the stupid uneducated fundies still eating fat.<p>Tomorrow: ""Oh, we were totally wrong about everything we said.  Ok, everyone!  Stop what ever you're doing!""<p>And now we get to laugh at all the stupid people who don't eat fat anymore.<p>Scientific method never <i>proves</i> anything, it's only good for disproving things.

On the other hand you are supposed to be paying by buying a copy: something that is an abundance with a natural price of zero.<p>Buying is not just setting a price according to the seller being a nice guy or having indirectly done something else. Buying is a market interaction: you aim to pay the lowest price available (Don't we want functioning markets?). Well, that is zero, because copies are infinitely available.<p>No matter how much the law tells us copies are restricted, they are not in <i>fact</i>, and we know it. The market will always drive toward making things available at the real physical cost of their production.

2567627,comment,2567334,2567526,5,0,kzaragoza,,,"You can trust them to continue diving into the science of nutrition. The interesting thing about this whole episode is that it serves as a wonderful illustration of the self-correcting nature of the scientific method.<p>Consider what's happened: First, health authorities made observations about diets and various diseases, creating hypotheses along the way. Next, they gathered some data and analyzed it. They drew conclusions from that data and made recommendations based on those conclusions.<p>Over time, more observations were made. More hypotheses were developed, more data was collected and analyzed, and the conclusions changed. This is the nature of science. We make decisions based on what we know at the time. If new evidence is found, we revise our theories and make different recommendations.<p>I think there is a problem, but it doesn't lie with the health authorities themselves. (Not that there aren't problems in the health field, but that's for another discussion.) Instead, the problem lies in how various other authorities use the information provided by the health professionals.<p>As the information and recommendations make their way through government, the issue becomes politicized, and politics frequently wins out over science. As the information is reported by the mainstream press, it is also sensationalized and frequently blown out of proportion. Going by the headlines in many publications, everything that is bad for you becomes good for you and vice versa every few years.<p>Rarely, if ever, do you see an attempt at understanding nutrition, the nature of the scientific process behind the recommendations, or a call for simple moderation. Yet that's what we need. We need government officials who are willing to listen carefully to the health professionals without allowing lobbyists to influence their decisions. (Corn sugar? Really?) We also need a press that is willing to educate the public rather than simply splash attention-getting headlines and content-free articles everywhere.<p>I doubt we'll see either of these things happen in our lifetimes, so it's up to us to educate ourselves, our families, and each other. Then, maybe, we'll start eating right and enjoy a healthy life.",1305899604

2567588,comment,2567334,2567334,29,0,joshklein,,,"I think there are a number of issues:<p>1 - People relate fat the nutrient to fat the body type because they share the word ""fat"". Not much to do there. In high school I was taught that carbohydrates were ""energy"" and fat was ""waste"". People should probably be taught the right way our biological systems operate.<p>2 - Medical authorities have worked with the best science they had available at the time, and are almost always managed by bureaucrats, not physicians. This isn't limited to the governmental level; hospitals, medical organizations, medical schools... the people in charge often have administrative training, not medical training. As a subpoint; sure, medical authorities have led us astray with nutrition information, but let's not jump to the conclusion that they have done something intentionally evil here.<p>3 - It's hard to prove any one way is the right way because of so many variables, including genetics, activity level, co-morbidities, and so on. More importantly, when something is right for 95% of people, that also means it is wrong for 5% of people. In the absence of easily testable datum, those anecdotes get a lot of attention. And even if it were easily testable, 5% of the time it would be wrong.<p>To me, the key is two-fold:<p>1 - People need to be educated about the facts of how their biological systems function. They need to know how calories work, insulin and blood sugar regulate, and gain a general appreciation of the science of their bodies.<p>2 - People need to be willing to ""listen to their bodies"" and experiment. That's the only way to know what really works for you, because you ARE different than everyone else. A healthy diet isn't just about finding mathematically optimal foods, it's about finding stuff you like to eat, that fills you up, that you can eat in moderation, that is easy to make. You need to be willing to mix health and convenience, taste and availability, etc... and that takes a bit of time to figure out.",1305898892

Part of its success has been its modularity - it has been long-lived, and used in unlikely places. Choosing the integration route significantly reduces future options. Heck, what if Oracle decides they don't want the expense of Solaris, and spin it off into its own company (yea, yea, I know)?<p>If Canonical (or other downstream) chose to do something like this, I would think it was a great decision.

But what if your sluggishness is a function of your eating habits or your mattress quality? I agree that there's no perfect formula that one can follow, but I think it's more of finding a ""system"" that you can apply to your life to break down the problems and correct them one by one. So, you might call up your area mattress shops with a 30-day return policy and pick one out that suits your budget. Sleep on your new mattress for 30 days and return it if it doesn't produce the desired results. <i>That's body hacking.</i><p>Finding the ""system"" is what intrigues me most about body/fitness hacking (and hacking/technology in general)",1305898395

It's not just about weight loss or gaining strength. There are chapters on sex, sleep, free diving, etc. that would probably interest many people on HN.<p>-------------------<p><pre><code>  >It's a prime example of good 21st century marketing, so at least that's something of use for a lot of HNers. The scientific and nutritional parts are a ""bit mixed"", to put it nicely. If I remember correctly, parts of it basically went ""this is scientifically proven because Wikipedia says so"".
</code></pre>
I don't think one should read it as a scientific or nutrition text book, but it's not fair to dismiss it as pure marketing either. There's lots of works cited and professional observations through out the book. You can't write a 500+ page NYT and Amazon bestseller based off of information you pull from Wikipedia articles no matter how good the marketing is.<p><pre><code>  >His ""slow-carb"" diet is basically a easier to digest low-carb diet mixed with a bit of CKD. 
</code></pre>
To me, the slow-carb way of life differs from the low-carb way of life in that you don't avoid all carbs, but be smart about the ones you choose. That's an important distinction. For instance, choosing dense nutrient-rich vegetables like spinach and broccoli over corn and green beans. He really encourages legumes like lentils and beans in the book, which I haven't seen as much in other low-carb style books.<p><pre><code>  >Kettlebells are good, but surely not the workout panacea he promises (and actually somewhat risky for people with back or knee problems who are doing this without proper supervision).
</code></pre>
Yeah, if you have serious health issues, please consult a physician. Every diet/health/fitness book has this basic disclaimer in the front pages. If it hurts, you are probably doing something very wrong.<p><pre><code>  >You should be able to get most of that info on the net, and there you often have some much-needed perspective and discussions about it. 
</code></pre>
Scouring the net for this information from various sources of questionable authority is a very bad use of one's time/money. Purchasing a 500+ page book for less than $20 which contains all of the information you need to get started on your body-hacking journey is a very good use of one's time/money.<p><pre><code>  >And those are the moderate parts of the book. If I can poke some holes into that, I don't even want to know what might be wrong with the more risque parts (injury prevention, bodybuilding, supplements). And the sex chapters would fit in nicely into drivel like ""The Game""...
</code></pre>
I'm not so interested in the ""risque parts"" and I wouldn't knock the sex parts until you've tried them ;) Really, you can avoid those parts if you want and still have loads of material to dive into and research farther.<p><pre><code>  >Don't get me wrong, I would love to have a ""body hacks"" book, but I'd prefer if it were done with a bit of scientific rigor, not just ""this worked for me, control group: me"".
</code></pre>
Honestly, I was skeptical at first too. But Tim really doesn't say ""this worked for me, control group: me"". There are dozens of on-the-field and in-the-lab experts he mentions (you can research their credentials/expertise further very easily, as I did) and hundreds of subjects. Again, it's not a scientific thesis -- it's a guide book on hacking one's body in a very efficient manner.",1305897764

The algorithm is extremely simple: ""If you ate yesterday, don't eat today."" It means I fast AT LEAST half days in a year (see: alternate day fasting). On fasting days, I drink water and green tea (with no sugar, of course). It has numerous purported health benefits. I can vouch for weight loss, lower blood pressure, more energy (perhaps paradoxically) and better digestion. It also frees a lot of time, since you don't have to plan, eat, or acquire food half the time and it turns out digestion also ""needs"" sleep, so I can get by with sleeping less on days I'm empty. The only side effect is that of lower blood pressure - I sometimes get dizzy if rising up fast from crouching. I started doing this after fasting for 60 hours every fortnight for a year, I loved the feeling and wanted more of it. It also makes me appreciate food much more on the days I do eat. As disclaimer (YMMV), I tend to avoid food additives which are known to be bad (coal tar-based paintstuffs, artificial sweeteners, certain emulgators and such) - the lists of those are widely available.

I agree with the OP that commands that you execute 10's or 100's of times a day should be made as short as possible and they'll be part of muscle memory.<p>You can't rely on muscle memory for history commands as you always need to pause and verify that history found what you were expecting it to find.   If your history looked like this (real shell history for me):<p><pre><code>    git push
    ssh ec2-75-101-198-99.compute-1.amazonaws.com
</code></pre>
the ^R would find the ssh command first, so you can't trust that ""^Rpu"" will always find the command so muscle memory can't set in and will slow you down",1305896863

I'm pretty much convinced now that even the limited outcry about the TSA's porno-scanners was just a media-creation to fill space in the annual travel stories around the holidays. Because they're still there.  But no-one's talking about it anymore.<p>And, honestly, we shouldn't be surprised.  The Drunk-Driving laws provided plenty of data going back decades.

I am not exactly anti-carb - I eat potatoes, and a little rice - but I have been eating a diet that I guess you could call 'Paleo 2.0' for the last 7 months or so.  The basic goal is to minimize my intake of grains, fructose, and legumes, and maximize that of saturated fats.  I also happen to be vegetarian, so for me this means a diet of mostly dairy and vegetables (and limited fruit).  I eat a lot of full fat Greek yogurt (Fage brand, typically), butter, cheese, eggs, very dark chocolate (85+%), potatoes, etc.  I eat until I'm full and I never count calories.  I probably cheat 1-2 times a week on average, usually by eating something rice- or corn-based (Chipotle, corn chips, an Indian meal with rice, etc.).<p>I didn't do this to lose weight - I wasn't exactly a big guy - but there were some surprisingly quick effects.  After about 5-6 months I'd dropped from around 155 lbs to 135 (+/-2), and I've been stable there for a couple months.  My waist went from 33"" to 30"" and my body fat went from around 21% to 12%.

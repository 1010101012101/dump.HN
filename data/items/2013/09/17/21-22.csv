6402195,comment,6398705,6398705,3,0,ilaksh,,,"Let me say first that I am a technologist and I do have generally speaking an optimistic view of the future where technology actually solves most of our problems.  I believe in the concept of the singularity where super-intelligent AI makes human intelligence irrelevant.   I have a completely different worldview from almost everyone reading this thread so what I am about to say will probably just be dismissed as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; or something but I need to say it just in case some people may be able to get something out of it without dismissing it out of hand.<p>Its going to be difficult for anyone who routinely exposes themselves to mainstream news sources to see any of what I am about to say as being credible.  Especially in the tech community where rose-colored glasses are almost ubiquitous.<p>He wonders why they didn&#x27;t stop the Syria chemical weapons attack and the Boston one.  The reason is that those were false flag attacks.  The Syria attack was committed by US-backed rebels and then blamed on the regime in order to be used as propaganda to motivate the extension of the covert proxy war in Syria into an overt one involving the US forces directly.<p>The Boston attack was used to motivate gun control which is important for securing the state against dissident factions when the economic situation deteriorates dramatically as it is likely to at some point when a substantive challenge to the petrodollar status is mounted.<p>Back to the war in Syria, I urge everyone to take a look at some maps of the middle east and Africa and make an X in all of the countries where the US and allies or related countries have been involved in recent decades (centuries).  You will see that this is a long term military campaign rather than a series of isolated wars.  Also take a look at a list of countries by proven oil reserves.  Also look up &#x27;petrodollar&#x27;.<p><a href=""http://www.indymedia.org.uk/images/2007/01/359290.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indymedia.org.uk/images/2007/01/359290.jpg</a><p>The Afghan War should be considered the Third Opium War as it was largely motivated by the Taliban wiping out the heroin cash crop belonging to the Anglo establishment and intelligence agencies.  <a href=""http://publicintelligence.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/AfghanOpiumSurvey2012-1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publicintelligence.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Afg...</a><p>The purpose of the NSA is not to control terrorism.  It is to keep tabs on potential enemies of the US, both domestic and foreign.  All US citizens and foreigners are actually considered potential enemies of the state.  The closest thing for people to understand is to compare it to the East German Stasi.  This type of apparatus may seem unnecessary now while the US is fat, happy and sitting pretty, but like I mentioned, the petrodollar cannot continue forever, and the state knows that.  Economic conditions will some day change very dramatically and lead to large-scale hunger, and at that time the previous removal of citizen&#x27;s arms and vast surveillance network will make the state much more secure in the face of growing domestic dissent.<p>Of course since most people have a totally different world view and are constantly bombarded by propaganda on television, this will all just seem like nonsense to you.",1379455086
6402194,comment,6398705,6401256,1,0,jessaustin,,,"<i>Obviously if the Politburo had been able to anticipate what Gorbachev would do, they would have had him killed instead of appointing him premier.</i><p>If <i>Gorbachev</i> had <i>known</i> the results of his actions ahead of time, he might well have chosen differently. I certainly don&#x27;t assume that he <i>wanted</i> to kill the USSR. I agree with you that none of the old conservative dudes would have done what Gorbachev did, but that was the reason they chose him rather than another old dude in the Brezhnev-Andropov-Chernenko line. Even the old dudes knew that the economy was failing, and had been for a decade. Therefore they chose their <i>youngest</i> member as Premier. When he made major changes as they had asked him, I&#x27;m sure they were uncomfortable, and they might not have anticipated those <i>particular</i> major changes, but they couldn&#x27;t very well be <i>surprised</i>. If there had been a radically authoritarian hard-line Communist option that he felt stood a major chance of saving the USSR, Gorbachev might well have chosen that. In any case, please don&#x27;t take Gorbachev&#x27;s actual, unsuccessful attempt to save the USSR as proof that no one knew it needed saving.<p>Gorbachev&#x27;s actions were not so unlike Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s in a similar situation, although of course results differed. That events turned out so much better for the Chinese Communist Party might be because they got a slightly earlier start, because of differences between China and USSR, due to chance, due to something else, or (probably) a combination of all of these. We in the West hold a more nuanced view of Deng, because we had a chance to see what he did after he won.<p>I&#x27;ll make this prediction: if the government of Iran ever starts genuinely reforming itself from within, it will be because they have judged Iran to be in a very precarious situation, from which their current policies are unable to extract them. If the result is a radical departure from the existing political structure, simpletons in the West will lionize whichever youngish cleric is most associated with the reforms. If instead they succeed in their intentions, and just make small necessary adjustments to Iranian society, we&#x27;ll all ask ourselves &quot;why couldn&#x27;t Iran have had a Gorbachev?&quot;",1379455085

Yes, I&#x27;m going for pathos, and that&#x27;s on purpose, pathos is central to the argument. The knowledge that the perpetrator has pain inflicted on him is an important factor in stitching their lives back together. I&#x27;d love for a proponent of the &quot;rational&quot; argument to sit down across from a mother whose daughter has been raped and explain that her feelings are irrational.<p>Yes, this is an irrational argument, but humans are irrational (the rape itself was probably a rather irrational act) - like it or not, that&#x27;s a fact of how humans work.

Look at the tennis ball example on the original article. Remember Google&#x27;s IRL photo-based game (Ingress), now just imagine that with fine-grained 3D (Google will use it to crowd-source a centimeter-model of the earth). Games like this remain a bit of a niche, but just imagine if someone makes a massive social game out it on FB (a cross between Farmville, Sims, and Minecraft, projected onto your real world). Of course, someone could also create a shocking IRL FPS game (imagine your kids pointing this out the window in traffic and &quot;shooting&quot; at people and cars to watch them blow up). Finally something to use the processing power in theses little phones and tablets.<p>- 3D photography. I think this is the future of photography. Take a picture of something, extract the spacial data from the image, modify it/change the p.o.v. Recall the recent image/object maniupulation video (the SIGGRAPH one that used the PatchMatch algorithm to fix the background). Each photo becomes a mini-scene that you can navigate around (kinda like the &quot;frozen&quot; 360 degree pans in the Matrix). Next step is time-dimension, in other words 3D immersive movies where the viewer can move around almost anywhere while the movie unfolds. You can guess the first industry to adopt this...<p>Both of these can currently be done with flat images, processing power, and some human guidance. With depth sensing it can be faster, automated, and more accurate.",1379453222

I never bought ingame currency, but I know the laws of supply and demand and dealt with the game accordingly. If you&#x27;re telling me that I should&#x27;ve just pretended the AH didn&#x27;t exist, I would say that you&#x27;re telling me not to play D3.<p>I wish people like you would stop telling me how to feel. I don&#x27;t think you have some superposition that lets you judge me and I wish you&#x27;d separate me from my opinions. I am a person, I have opinions, but when you say &quot;people like me&quot; you lump me into a general audience and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t speak for anyone other than myself.<p>I would quite seriously invite you to consider that I invested a lot of time into D3 and played through a number of updates. I know exactly what I wanted out of a D3 experience and I can tell you in excruciating detail how it failed; this isn&#x27;t the time or place for that.<p>The fact is, it took almost a decade for the game to come out, why the fuck did it have to ship as an unplayable pile of crap?<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m not trying to be offensive, but you&#x27;re asking for patience when, as a consumer, I&#x27;ve been basically told that my investment in the game isn&#x27;t enough for Blizzard: they need to make money off of my invested hours as well. I&#x27;m happy that Blizzard is improving the game but I&#x27;m not willing to give them any more of my time after what I view as a waste of my time.<p>It&#x27;s true Diablo games improve over time, but wow was D3 a steaming pile of garbage when it launched. I mean if they had just implemented D2 with new graphics and content, it would&#x27;ve been glorious.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m sorry to rant, but the crux of my point is that you can&#x27;t attack me personally for my opinions and expect to have a good discussion.

This is unreliable across build options and compilers so it would be unwise to depend on it. There is an opportunity here for a tool that could identify places where you could insert move, perhaps even a -W option for the trivial cases such as above, but I am not convinced the language should allow the compiler to do this.<p>Do you make it mandatory and add more special cases for the compiler to have to implement? This would require the compiler to track references to make sure they don&#x27;t get passed to some other function. It would need someone to codify the special cases in the standard and this might be very difficult. It would also be fragile, there would be cases where implicit move used to kick in but some added function call inhibits it even though a move is still the right thing to do.",1379451776

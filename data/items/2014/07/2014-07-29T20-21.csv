8104983,comment,8104440,8104440,6,0,ignostic,,,"I do hope everyone realizes this is silly.<p>Everything in this comparison relies on the quality of data. The &quot;number of innovations&quot; data comes exclusively from a book by Isaac Asimov with under 1500 entries. To make some sort of grand pronouncement about a date range for the end of humanity based on Asimov&#x27;s very subjective and unscientific qualification of what makes an innovation is absurd.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that we think incremental improvement matters less than a brand new idea. Even steel tools built upon prior knowledge, and took decades to get right. Machines were incremental improvements from manually powered systems, which gradually evolved into the complex machiens we have now.<p>Some of these changed may feel like evolutionary innovations rather than revolutionary ideas, but that&#x27;s how technology develops. It&#x27;s easy to look at past innovations from the Greeks, because we see how the technology went from 0 to amazing. But we do it in retrospect, and speaking in terms of centuries, which makes innovations appear to spring out of nowhere more than they actually did.",1406667562

In other words, the service being accessed through an app will be equally if not more important compared to the app itself. And I just don&#x27;t see indie devs being able to manage and scale on both fronts equally, yet. Maybe the more infrastructure as a code and web app development get commoditized, the better will be the chances for indies to shine/profit again? Until then, app is just gonna be a fancy (and in many cases the only) endpoint for most sustainable business models.",1406667494

Where you need to tune things is figure out who the spenders are and raise your ROI. You state that you spent $700 to get $261 in revenue which is about 37% ROI. Not good, but its a start atleast. Obviously you want to be above 1.  What I would do is invest a little in some analytics, figure out who your spenders are and cohort them. Then see if you can reduce your spend, become more targeted in your buying, while also increasing opportunities to earn more revenue.  Just my $0.02",1406667400

We can&#x27;t expect them to occur at a constant rate simply because it will get harder and harder to learn eveything required to invent some <i>really</i> new technology/scientific discovery. I like to think of human knowledge as a chunk of information that we compress and pass along. There&#x27;s only so much we can compress, and our brain hasn&#x27;t really changed significantly to accomodate and absorb more information faster. The result of course is specialization, and again specialized innovations by definition have limited scope.<p>4) To claim we had no specialized breakthroughs recently is even more ridiculous.

8104851,comment,8104365,8104365,12,0,arrrg,,,"Ha, I’ve done similar things, but I’m still in the middle of it, 62 pounds in to be exact, that’s about the half-way point.<p>The key component turned out to be the scale for me. Automatic tracking works much better for me than manually keeping track of it. (I also got a Withings scale, but I don’t think the brand matters. As long as the scale automatically logs everything without you having to do anything or even look how much you weigh in the morning it’s great.) Seeing your whole progress in one graph really helps me keep on track.<p>A week without progress even though you did all the exercise you always do and ate like you always do? With the trend-line and the chart going all the way back you can easily see that it’s just a statistical anomaly, most likely random noise (probably mostly dependent on when you drank your water and when you went to the toilet). It doesn’t mean progress has stopped.<p>That 2lb setback, probably because I wasn’t careful about what I eat? Now I look back all the way I have come and those 2lbs seem harmless. That’s a ridiculously tiny amount of weight to lose. It’s so easy. Just some extra care to what I eat and how active I am and I’m all set.<p>With manual tracking (mostly memorising what I weighed and remembering it the next day) I would at these points just get afraid of the scale and eventually stop weighing myself. The whole process was less transparent with manual tracking and the automatically logging scale demystified it for me. During my previous attempts weeks without any progress just doomed me and got me to this really dark place. No I’m not even bothered by them. The trend-line is going down. Always.<p>Now, step counters may not be accurate or even a good way to track how active you are (and walking or cardio may not the best ways to aid weight loss) but the built-in step counter in my iPhone that I have always with me (plus my podcast addiction and the beautiful weather this summer) actually lead me to automatically want to beat those 10,000 steps per day. And at some point I just started doing it. I think there isn’t one day during the last two months where I didn’t walk at least 9,000 steps per day, without even consciously deciding to do that. I just wanted to beat those 10,000 steps. I want to see the bar turn green and the 10,000 to light up. That has helped me tremendously to stay active (and not just move less when I started eating less).<p>I also started driving the ergometer for 30 minutes every day and while I don’t really track that I’m seeing my progress (I can drive with more and more resistance and without any breaks in-between) – also with my scale. The heart rate measurement doesn’t work so well (it fails two times out of three) but it also shows steady downward progress. From a resting heart rate in the high 80s I’m now down to a healthy one in the low 60s. I also feel much better and sleep much better. (This would certainly be beneficial for me, even without any weight loss.)<p>All this progress also motivates me to constantly optimise. Next step: Buy good shoes and convert some of that walking distance into running distance. (70 minutes of walking per day are a bit long, but doable. However, with some running I can bring that time down.)<p>(The eating story is similar. I don’t particularly care about what I eat, but when you restrict how much you eat you will automatically tend to prefer food that makes you feel fuller. That’s at least how it was for me so far. I don’t want to eat pasta every day because then I wouldn’t ever feel full. And when I do eat pasta I would rather make the portion a bit smaller and add a salad for the saved calories to feel fuller.)<p>Will it work? Ask me in three years. I hope so. I think keeping up my weighing routine forever will be the key. If I can do that I see no reason why I can’t keep at it and at least hold my weight (but most likely lose some more and hold the weight I want to have). I’m cautiously optimistic. This is the most weight I have ever lost in my life and the longest I have been at it and I don’t even feel constantly starving or demotivated or crushed (something that was common during previous attempts). I actually feel great most of the time.<p>Get tracking! It helped me.",1406666061

I read books, but only books that pointed directly to scientific literature I could read. More importantly, I learned how to differentiate good nutrition studies from bad nutrition studies (hint: at least 90% of nutrition studies are <i>bad</i>) so I could tell when an conclusion is warranted by the data versus when it isn&#x27;t. I also started completely ignoring anything said in the media, since, invariably, they get it wrong or they hype the afore-mentioned bad studies. Everything became about the science and the n=1 experiments.<p>What I found was that I could lose weight without effort, improve every health marker, and enjoy the foods my body really seemed to desire (as opposed to foods engineered to cause cravings). The 70 pounds disappeared without any tracking of anything[1]. More importantly, that 70 pounds was gone a year ago, and maintaining the loss has been just as straightforward.<p>I applaud anybody who finds the method that works for them. It&#x27;s pretty clear our bodies are striving to be healthy and get what they need; once you find that, the rest comes relatively easy.[2]<p>1. There was some early tracking as I learned about different foods and how they interacted with me and my goals.<p>2.

8104724,comment,8103833,8104419,1,0,bellerocky,,,"The other thing that AWS has going for it is widely adopted third party support. Pretty much any software, site, tool or service that has any sort of cloud monitoring, deployment etc feature will be integrated with AWS. This not true for any of AWS&#x27;s competitors. I&#x27;ve never seen a third-party provide support for an AWS competitor before supporting AWS. I know monitoring tools that do not support Azure, Google Cloud or Rackspace. I know libraries that don&#x27;t support all of them but always support AWS.<p>In addition most sysadmins and developers will be more likely  familiar with AWS&#x27;s tools, API and dashboard. They&#x27;ll be more likely to already have their development environment set up with AWS command lines tools. You ever heard of someone with HP cloud tools installed [1]? I frequently browse dotfiles on GitHub and often see non-sensitive AWS credentials and aliases. I&#x27;ve never seen a Rackspace or Google Cloud thing in them.<p>AWS wins on mindshare. It&#x27;s also a proven system. Infrasture decisions are really important, and downtime is very bad and when you choose AWS you know at the very least that if your shit goes down because of provider issues everyone else will be down too and you can kind of get a pass (although outsourcing downtime is kind of shitty), but if you&#x27;re not on AWS and your shit goes down because of the provider people will ask you why aren&#x27;t you using AWS. Your customers and investors might actually be unhappy with you because of this.<p>As for support Google also has terrible support, Rackspace&#x27;s managed support is very expensive and actually probably not what a competent team would want, otherwise it is easy to get a person on the phone at Rackspace, so that is commendable. Support doesn&#x27;t scale, but if you are paying AWS a lot I bet you can get support.<p>I don&#x27;t really like the mono-culture of AWS everywhere, but I feel like the points above need to be raised. A standard on APIs like OpenStack would be nice, but implementations will differ and AWS will fight this kind of change and because of their dominance getting traction will be hard.<p>[1] this is actually a thing: <a href=""https://docs.hpcloud.com/cli"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.hpcloud.com/cli</a>",1406664955

I&#x27;d happily commute for twice as long on a train if I got to read. (Yes, self-driving cars could change this in a few decades, but living in the city could change it now.)<p>- The more you drive, the more you are contributing to distasteful regimes in the Middle East and the distasteful US foreign policy intended to secure our oil interests. If you drive an electric vehicle (and aren&#x27;t covered by nuclear power), you&#x27;ve simply replaced oil with coal.<p>- Children can&#x27;t get <i>anywhere</i> other than maybe some friends&#x27; houses without you driving them. This is maybe a feature for a 5-year-old, but a soul-crushing bug when a 15-year-old still can&#x27;t go anywhere without you. The &quot;chauffeur&quot; aspect of parenthood is something that <i>you choose</i> by living in sprawl.<p>- Teenagers can&#x27;t realistically hold jobs without having their own cars, either, and at minimum wage, owning a car that starts and might not kill you in a collision will wipe out a good portion of your earnings. (Exception would be if one parent doesn&#x27;t work or telecommutes but still has a car. I was fortunate enough to be in this situation, but it could have evaporated any day.)<p>- There is just very little to <i>do</i> as a kid/teenager other than consume media and/or drugs (although I guess that doesn&#x27;t matter for the hacker types, since all you need is a laptop anyway). If going downtown wasn&#x27;t a special event, you could have access to a wealth of libraries, bookstores, restaurants, museums, theater, symphony, opera, etc. which often give <i>extremely</i> sweet discounts to K12 students as well as college kids. You&#x27;re going to experience these things less often if getting to them is onerous (and requires parking at $10+/hour). Instead, social life revolves around the mall and finished basements.<p>- DUI seems to be more of an issue, not less, since everyone is by default driving everywhere.<p>- I just get this visceral feeling of isolation. It&#x27;s like living in a snowglobe. I&#x27;ve seen everything there is to see. I&#x27;ve met everyone (in my age group) there is to meet. I&#x27;ve been through every inch of every building I have access to. There is <i>nothing left to explore</i>. It&#x27;s horrifying, and <i>not</i> what I want my kids to be experiencing at 15-16-17. In a decent-sized city, there&#x27;s always more. There&#x27;s always something you haven&#x27;t seen or been to or been to in a while. There&#x27;s something incredibly comforting about knowing you can never exhaust all your options. High school was fine, my parents were fine, but I just couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of suburbia and never come back. (It seems lots of kids feel this way... the word for it is &quot;ungrateful.&quot;)<p>The big-box stores, cookie-cutter houses, etc. are a matter of aesthetics, and people have different tastes. I personally can&#x27;t sleep in silence. But the environmental impact and the suffocation of non-drivers is <i>real.</i><p>I like cars. I&#x27;d love to own a 3-series or a Tesla or something and go drive it fast out in the country, \nbut owning and driving a car shouldn&#x27;t be a prerequisite for being a functioning member of society.<p>There might come a time when I want to own rather than rent, but it will be within walking distance of an electric train.",1406664861

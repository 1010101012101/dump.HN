However, these (among others) are infrastructural contributions to the backend. I think the article is talking about innovation from the average consumer's perspective.<p>I remember speaking to a friend of mine when Google released Wave. He said Wave was the first real home-grown ""product"" since GMail and it was his opinion that it was developed in Australia because the office there was a kind of skunkworks plant with little bureaucratic oversight compared to the other Google offices around the world (whether this is true, I don't know). He said Google were at the stage where they are big enough for middle management to stifle real innovation because the individual managers don't need to take the kind of risk required with greenlighting a project like Wave (and look how that turned out!).<p>To Google, buying an early-stage startup is a cost-effective way of outsourcing the risk-taking and that kind of acquisition is the closest they can now get to serious innovation and staying competitive.",1290001967

I am not suggesting that the use of labels isn't helpful, only that the use of labels doesn't really differentiate ""visual programming"" as a subset of programming, i.e. in and of itself a text label is not significantly more visual than text on a terminal screen.<p>For example, the label is necessary because the visual convention for ""start"" is ambiguous. Left, right, top and bottom are all used as a starting position depending on the arbitrary conventions of the context. Likewise, a MaBell styled receiver, green flag, a vertical stroke or a hand with index finger extended as if to press a button may all be used to indicate start.<p>I used your departure from flowcharting conventions as an illustration of the unique problems with graphical communication conventions.  I am  not implying that deviating from flow charting convention is a bad idea.<p>My point is that your deviation from flowcharting conventions is arbitrary in the sense that it was driven by factors irrelevant to the process of flow charting (i.e. the limitations of the medium on which the flowchart is presented rather than concerns about the mapping of graphic symbols to processes).",1290001297

It would have started with most of the investment banks being unable to do business and shutting their doors.  This would have caused a chain reaction other parts of the financial system since the big money-center banks provide much of the overnight lending liquidity for smaller banks (and each other).  Banks would start failing at an incredible rate.<p>As the banks started to fail, the equities, bond and commodities markets would have collapsed.  All these markets rely on short term lending, not just for leverage, but to underwrite transactions.  Even if this were not the case, much trading volume would have dried up.  This combined would have led to a crash in those markets.<p>Finally, and most importantly, most businesses rely on lines of credit and other short term debt facilities to finance day to day operations.  They use this to smooth out the cash flow when buying raw materials/inventory, purchasing assets and meeting payroll.  These would have all been effectively frozen.  You would have either seen paychecks becoming worthless or massive layoffs within a few weeks to a few months of the initial bank collapses.  By massive, I mean a spike of an <i>additional</i> 10% to 20% unemployment within a few weeks or months.<p>I won't go into the effect all this would have on currencies and international trade.<p>All told, it would probably have plunged the entire world into a depression that would have rivaled or exceeded the Great Depression of the 1930's.  It likely would have been worse because of the interconnectedness of the world's financial and commercial systems today.",1290000977

Inevitably productivity will seem to skyrocket for the early trial period of awards (or any metrics-based system), until the ass-kissers and numbers-experts figure out how to game the system.  Then you have people over-documenting bugs, using multiple VCS commits to ""fix"" minor text updates (because ""they occur in different areas of the code"", or something equally ridiculous), and similarly wasting time and efforts just to unlock an achievement.  Once this starts occurring, the same people always carry the same prize (badge, whatever), and work ethic and motivation reverts to a state that is probably less satisfying for the team than it was prior to the achievement-based system.  Also, your code maintenance and issue trackers are riddled with pointless records, making troubleshooting, reporting (other than for your achievements), and code reverts require a painstaking effort.<p>If you have a team that collaborates well enough to keep something like this from having detrimental effects - don't waste your time.

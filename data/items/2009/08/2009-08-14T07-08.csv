762580,comment,762299,762564,0,0,cduan,,,"Tofu is a protein too! The great thing is that all these things are easily interchangeable, so you use whatever you like.<p>Your post did remind me of an advanced technique. If you are cooking chunks of protein, the best method is to first fry the protein, then take it out, and then follow the original recipe. Why? Because you want to get that browning, and you only get that with direct contact between the protein and the pan. (This is known as the Maillard reaction.) But if you leave the protein in the whole time, it dries up faster than the vegetables (they have cell walls that are hard to soften).",1250236687

  * 4 cups white rice
  * Bag of frozen vegetables
  
  1. Preheat oven to 400°.
  2. Salt and pepper chicken.
  3. Place chicken on half sheet pan.
  4. Bake for approximately 20 minutes, until the juices run completely clear, with
     no trace of pink, when a fork is inserted.
  
  While the chicken's cooking:
  
  1. Place rice in saucepan.
  2. Add 2 cups water (or as much as the package instructions say).
  3. Bring to boil.
  4. Turn heat down as low as it goes, stir, and cover pot.
  5. Cook for approximately 15 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Do
     not lift the lid until the end, to check whether the water's been absorbed.
  
  5 minutes before the chicken and rice are done:
  
  1. Place frozen vegetables in a microwave-safe container.
  2. Add a few tablespoons of water.
  3. Microwave for 5 minutes.
  4. Salt and pepper.

There is nothing in Guangzhou, at least not computer or multimedia electronic gadgets; but you find everything else in GZ. DongGuan is mostly textiles, heavy machinery and manufacturing equipment; I wouldn't trust a company based in DG to sell me a netbook. Avoid Hong Kong by all means, you will be paying premium for someone to take the 40 minute KCR train to ShenZhen.<p>Laptops are extremely expensive in China because of local demand. In fact, I exported IBM Thinkpads from U.S. to China at handsome profit. There are ""shell"" laptops that look and function like any other laptop, but they're just <i>shells</i>. The Chinese are excellent at making flash-memory based gadgets, but their harddisk based gadgets have plenty of catching up to do (we bought Chinese stuff and fitted them with harddisks in our houses in London and New York)<p>Most <i>good</i> Chinese companies can afford sales staff with excellent English communication skills. Though they're not always proficient, the professional sales stuff are <i>polished</i> and know their industry inside and out. Scammers, OTOH, usually have impeccable English but are not professionals; legit sales people will try to talk trash about a competition, while a scammer will tell you he can offer you his competition's products as well. Legit salesmen don't make decisions on the spot. If you tell them you want a container of this products, they will ask you if they can come back with an answer. Scammers have an enviable 'can do' attitude.<p>[Update:<p>Face, face, face! Don't lose face and don't cause someone else to lose face. Every word you say will be remembered and will be held against you; don't hint at a huge order unless you're going to place it. Your salesman is counting on a commission, and if he knows he has a big order coming he might just spend his few hundred last kuwais trying to impress you and host you for lavish dinners (and if you're not there, he will pre-invest that money in another client of his, treating him to expensive nights out.)<p>It's better to low-ball your ambitions and earn their respect when you place a huge order.<p>A legit company's salesman will probably be asking about your budget and MOQs right of the bat. That's how you can tell scammers, they're happy to sell you a ""sample"" and offer to deliver it DHL. If your legit company does free shipping, they will certainly don't wanna do DHL or FedEx or anything that expensive; if your margins are good enough pay for the shipping yourself.<p>]",1250233775

4176355,comment,4176075,4176075,72,0,cletus,,,"I seriously groaned when I saw this post (title).<p>I was expecting an elitist diatribe about PHP (because this is perennially popular amongst particular programmers) but that's not what this post is intended to be.<p>Interestingly Jeff does take the usual potshots at PHP almost like he thinks he'll lose street cred if he doesn't but the basic message I agree with: if you want someone to stop doing something you consider undesirable give them better alternatives.<p>That being said, I simply disagree with the premise. PHP has a lot going for it:<p>1. The CGI type model of creating everything, servicing an HTTP request and tearing everything down is a powerful one (and used in Python, Ruby and elsewhere). Once you go stateful (eg Java servlets) you have to worry about resource leakage;<p>2. PHP has a stateless core of API functions. IMHO this is basically ideal for Web programming given (1). It makes startup/teardown cheap and reduces resource usage (making it cheaper to provide for hosting);<p>3. Imperative programming is IMHO a natural fit for Web programming. One thing that's wrong with PHP is all the bloated OO mega-frameworks people create on top of it to try and make it Java, Rails, whatever; and<p>4. Inline code in HTML is a powerful technique. The learning curve for PHP is quite gentle.<p>So if you want to make a better PHP (something I'd encourage anyone to do rather than simply jumping on the PHP hating bandwagon) you should tick all the above boxes. Of course if you do this, you will probably want to fix some of the following:<p>- argument order consistency<p>- API function naming consistency<p>- default to HTML escaping on output<p>- effectively default to SQL parameter binding<p>- no register globals<p>- and so on<p>Side note: all of the above is well known. Pointing it out in yet another PHP hating blog post is both pointless and boring.<p>Jeff also asserts that PHP's popularity is sheep mentality. What nonsense. (1)-(4) above explain it far more than that, particularly the cheap hosting and inline coding.<p>I like to point out that 4 of the top 20 sites are built using PHP (Facebook, Yahoo, Flickr, Wikipedia) so--like it or not--it must be doing something right.<p>Homer (Simpson) once said ""sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making other people look bad and I'm sick of making people feel good about themselves"". I see a lot of that with (us) geeks but it's just so unproductive and pointless. You don't need to hate on ""not X"" to justify your choice of ""X"" (X = Python, Ruby, Lisp, Clojure, Scala, GPU type, phone type, tablet type, camera type, you get the idea).<p>EDIT: as far as Facebook goes, they didn't ""give up"" and use HipHop, they decided to have their cake and eat it too. They get the productivity benefits of programming Web pages in a ""fit for purpose"" language while getting most of the performance benefits of native code and they only had to give up some small subset of PHP to do it.<p>If you argue the subset thing is a problem try working in any C++ shop where using only a small subset of the language is <i>de rigeur</i>.",1340974540

It is not <i>possible</i> to replace the built-in browser (there are no hooks to have an other application handle e.g. `http` links), but it is perfectly possible to release (and sell) a ""browser"" application through which websites can be accessed<p>2. It is allowed to render any content, but it is not allowed to <i>execute downloaded code</i> save through the built-in interpreter, so a browser can't run javascript code locally.

4176329,comment,4164784,4175160,1,0,tluyben2,,,"Well, I am doing it again now and it works again. I think services companies don't get funded (in general, because they DO get funded once they get to a certain size) because they don't scale. If you invest $10 million in a service company, there is almost no chance you'll get a ROI of 1000% or even 10000%, but you actually, in my experience (but we actually might be an exception; the ONLY thing I see us doing differently from most companies on HN is that we watch the bottom line from the get-go; if there is $1 going out, there WILL be $1.3-2 coming in from the very first day we start) can expect 150-200% which is surely a better invest than most things you can invest in.<p>And of course, 200-10000% ROI is on that ONE company that makes it, out of N companies invested in. Again, in my experience with services, and i'm talking bars/clubs, laundry services and software services; all of which I or very good friends have experience with, there is not that much failure going on. One of my good friends opens bars/clubs ; he gets $300k investment, opens up, hires people, makes everything run and the investor gets about $1 million back after a few years. Every time, even in crisis times. Why? My friend is brilliant at this and it's definitely not 'luck'; he knows what he is doing. Accidentally I met another guy in the place I live now who I befriended who does exactly the same; different country, different rules, different times and he does EXACTLY the same; from the way he finds places, does the makeover/revamp, hires and trains people etc. I learned a lot from these guys; if you work the same way in a software company it works as well. Of course the skills are different, but the management style the same. I can honestly tell you that every services company I will start or mentor will make profit and enough profit to have a really nice life.

That has worked wonders for  languages since. Except not one has come out that is as simple as PHP thus PHP will continue to exist. Everyone that invents a language now focuses on abstract concepts that do not help the everyday developer do anything useful. Is it so shocking it's still around?

Apple designs very elegant software (and hardware) so that they can sell hardware at a high premium. Google views all monetization through search optimization. Search, Maps etc. Now maybe there will be commerce streams (Play, Wallet?) too soon which makes having a direct relationship very key.<p>So somewhere Google has a stat that says ""A regular user is worth $22 a year to us"" or something (more sophisticated) but like that. If those users buy an Apple device it's less and less clear they'll have a path to Google services now.<p>If they can acquire that consumer ""for free"" (sell them a device that hooks them into the platform at a wash) then it's a good deal. If they gave it away for free then it would take x number of years to break even on that person. So that $200 or whatever does matter.

4176241,comment,4175592,4175820,6,0,kimmel,,,"There are no pros for craigslist having an API. This is a for-profit company that has chosen not to be greedy bastards. If they wanted they could have an advertisement on every single page of the site but they don't. Craigslist is cost free to almost all users, is fast, and has little down time.<p>Here are some of the reasons why offering an API is not a good fit for them.<p>* Craigslist does not need users driven to it which is a side effect of having an API. They are already large and in charge.<p>* Unless they charge for the API it is a waste of CPU cycles and eventually technical support from an actual person to support this. It is a cost sink.<p>* Craigslist does not sell anything directly like ebay or amazon. Ebay and Amazon have apis to drive traffic to them. Then a user sells something on the service and ebay/amazon get a cut, that is how their services work, not craigslist.<p>* ""if people care so much about craigslist features, then just build something and offer them the code for free."" This was a comment from another user and it makes a great point. Like the engineer who stayed on at Apple to finish his project, something like that could happen to make craigslist better. Has anyone bothered to try and lets see the code?<p>* craigslist has not shown any intention to move into other markets besides online ads. A publicly facing API would allow others to develop new services and allow craigslist to buy them. This has not happened.<p>* No major corporation came along and helped craigslist why should they help you? In fact craigslist fought against entrenched newspapers across the globe to create their user base. To sum this point up ""There is no such thing as a Free lunch"".<p>I am sure I am forgetting a few other good reasons why they are not offering an API. To me it comes down to a bunch of people bitching about how they built a service on top of data they did not own or control and when it was taken away they act shocked. To me that is just plain business idiocy. If you start a business one of the first things you do is secure your supply chain, in this case the apartment listing data.",1340972369

They evolved their creatures up to a certain level in simulation then made them real with a combination of 3D printed parts and manually inserted motors.<p>I've seen the video before and it's kind of cool, can't find the link now though. Anyone?",1255776992

Very smart and playful dog, requires absolutely no grooming. In many ways it's very much like a cat: Long claws, licks itself clean, loves to cuddle in your lap.<p>You'll have to enjoy running, though, as this dog requires (once fully developed) about two 1hour instances of jogging/running every day.",1255776578

886836,comment,886109,886214,0,0,gaius,,,"Everything costs nothing while you're using resources that you've already paid for, is a more accurate way of looking at it. At the point you exhaust those resources, the cost is the cost of adding more.<p>It's like the old memory/cpu/whatever is cheap argument. Yes it is, until you run out. Then you're in trouble.",1255776296

'hacking' their scratching urges by hacking random trees, railings, decking etc to bits in neighbors gardens? Do not like. :)<p>I'd love to setup some automated webcam -> nerf gun system to automatically hit any cat in the head if they enter my property. Maybe a project for when I'm old and bitter and have time on my hands :)<p>If you live anywhere near other people, a cat is probably the most antisocial pet to have. (Assuming you let them out on their own)",1255775560

886828,comment,886455,886455,0,0,listic,,,"I suspect you can get away with things like these in Kenya because the state is weak and cannot enforce regulation in the banking sphere, i.e. demand banking licenses and proper accounting from phone companies.<p>Allowing for easy money transfer between cell phones leaves less control for the state and opens up opportunities for financing illegal activities and money laundering. From egoistical or anarchistic point of view it would be cool, but one can clearly see why it isn't allowed in many other countries.<p>In Russia banking system also sucks (though not so badly) and usage of banking services by the general population is low. So is quite widespread to pay small amounts, like for paid web services, with SMS, or to repay small personal debts by topping person's cell phone (prepaid system is prevalent). But phone to phone transfers are not allowed. And if you wish to receive payment for your online game via SMS, operators take commission of 30% to 50%. Is it that bad in other countries as well?",1255775314

My IM client doesn't autostart; I start it manually when I want to chat with someone or when I get to know that someone needs to chat with me. It seems to look very radical for the folks in my company, but I think it's common sense.",1255774125
886821,comment,886697,886727,0,0,JustAGeek,,,"Cat, agreed.\nHowever, if you leave it alone a lot and if it can't be let out, then you need two cats so there's always somebody to play with and the cat doesn't get bored causing it to develop odd behavior.<p>As for the sex of the cat, I'd suggest tomcats. If female cats get in heat, it'll get quite annoying for both you and the cat and the only way out is sterilization. It's a routine operation, yet much more invasive than castration of a tomcat.",1255774060

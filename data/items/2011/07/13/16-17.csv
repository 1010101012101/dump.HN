One of the fundamental principles is that <i>A patent is a sword, not a shield.</i> Owning a patent doesn't shield you from litigation, it simply allows you to litigate against others.<p>The ""patent arsenal"" idea is that if you  have a trove of patents, you can respond to competitors by cross-licensing. The competitor won't sue you if they don't want to be sued in turn, a kind of mutual non-agression pact.<p>This doesn't work against a patent troll, who is not in business and cannot be sued on the basis of any patent. I apologize in advance if this simile is offensive, but I think patents are a little like nuclear weapons. They are very effective as a deterrent against other fully functioning countries attacking you, because they know that even if they ""win"" the war, they will lose.<p>But what is their value against terrorists? Nothing, because the terrorists do not have anything you can attack with a  nuclear weapon.

Do we go with a free open-source solution like KVM, forgoing an easy-to-use GUI, or do we go with a more expensive solution such as VMware?<p>We eventually decided to build a KVM-based cluster, and while we were already extremely glad we did before the vSphere 5 licensing change, this latest development only serves to confirm the wisdom of our choice. We have enterprise-level support if we need it, the virsh command-line interface is very straightforward and easy to pick up, and we have not shackled our fates to an organization that can yank the rug out from under us whenever they like. Moreover, for Linux-based folks who find themselves pondering their options, consider that VMware requires that you run Windows in your cluster if you want the full advantages of vSphere (e.g., live migration). Because of the added maintenance and security concerns, we were quite loathe to introduce any Windows operating systems into our cluster environment, and the unfortunate state of the VMware world is that it's extremely Windows-centric.<p>The best part? Not only do we have a fast, rock-solid virtualization solution in place, but the easy-to-use GUI we wanted is also on the horizon. Take one look at the Archipel Project at <a href=""http://archipelproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archipelproject.org/</a>, and I think you'll agree its interface puts vSphere to shame.

If the start-up world wasn't difficult enough already I recently ran into a an issue that might sink my little bootstrapped ship a little faster than anticipated.  I can change my name and re-brand my business but after four months of preliminary marketing and research efforts I'm in 'that' place where I need to start promoting my businesses, follow up with my contacts and hopefully make a little money.<p>My scenario is a little unique in that I developed my start-up ( I couldn't find anything else in the market I liked )to help me launch a few other business ideas with more traditional businesses models.  I did not Trademark my start-up name but I have been live for about 4 months and have made contact with over 800 interested artists/businesses ( I used Sonicbids.com to run a promotion to attract artists and musicians).  I feel my intent to use this name has been shown. I have also developed a mobile app that plays off and works to compliment the start up name which reinforces the idea that re-branding is possible but not ideal.<p>I threw out a question to the team at Sprouter and this was their response.<p>""The good news is that just by making use of a brand name, you require certain trademark rights in it. Therefore, if you have made any public use of this name prior to Google making its announcement, you might possibly have certain common law trademark rights in it. However, if this is something that has merely been in development and you have made no public use of it, or even if you have made only limited public use of it, you will have some difficulty in asserting your rights against Google. Your best course of action at this point is to retain a lawyer who can review the specifics of your case and consider whether or not contacting Google at this stage is a good option available to you in order to reach some sort of co-existence agreement.""<p>I question the idea of 'limited public use', in that I developed the platform to help me launch and market my businesses with the thought that any additional users of my platform would be a bonus as I don't need millions of users to make my model profitable.<p>Google is using the name for their Google TV 2.0 platform for Android and their first press release showed up around June 22, 2011.  I'm using the name as a social network with a mobile app and have been live since mid March of this year, and although I have gained very little traction, the idea is I can prove the viability of my platform by using it to market my other business ideas (clothing, music and blog/app).  Once that happens I will market my platform more aggressively to outside users with proven vs speculative results.<p>fishtank(google) vs. http://fishtaank.com (dave)<p>Any thoughts?

Think Optimus (on windows).<p>A major difference however is that Optimus switches based on a software list, whereas OSX switches based on APIs used. And never switches back until the application(s) which triggered the switch is closed.<p>This has the unfortunate effect that some software trigger the switch even though they're just using some nice transitions/animations (Twitter/OSX, Sparrow and Reeder all trigger the discrete GPU for instance), because these are flagged as switchers. And of course the discrete GPU burns more power than the IGP.<p>gfx provides two services:<p>* Tell the user whether he's on discrete, and which application(s) triggered the switching<p>* Allow users to force things one way or an other (and setup different configurations depending on whether using battery or AC). While this is an advanced feature and can lead to weird results (MBPs don't support a second screen via the IGP for instance, so nothing will happen and if you try to switch entirely you'll just have a black screen. And applications which actually need the discrete GPU will freeze or crash) it's quite useful.<p>FWIW one of the major issue is that Flash <i>can</i> trigger the switch (I've never investigated too much, but I guess one or two precise functions use flagged OSX APIs), and in that case to switch back without gfx you have to ensure the relevant tab is closed and restart your browser.",1310575001

They claim it was an honest mistake and the support personnel were confused. Whoops. Motorola has recently confirmed that we will never even get a security update. I didn't know at the time that Motorola were such incompetent assholes and would both lie and never ship updates. Maybe if I had known that I would have learned beforehand what was the locked bootloader.<p>Like I said, I've learned my lesson. My family will never, ever buy anything made by Motorola. Motorola points their fingers at the carrier and the carrier points their finger at the manufacturer. I'm tired of these games. That's it. End of story. It's Nexus only from now on.

In their world, you hassle people for a discount and fight over contract terms.<p>Why do you think that Red Hat sells support contracts in the guise of a software license?<p>Answer: Because the processes that enable big companies/government to spend money on services are vastly different than software. On a services contract, you need to negotiate statements of work, etc. For a software contract, you just need to buy a software SKU and a maintenance/support SKU.",1310573343

And if they are ok at it, they spend obscene amounts of money to do so.<p>One of the key advantages of VMWare from a operational point of view is the management capability, which is either much better than what most people have for physical hardware or much cheaper. Even with this new licensing model, VMWare still offers a positive ROI for a large customer, since that customer would also need to buy more licenses for products like IBM/Tivoli, CA Unicenter, BMC, etc. Those products are mega-buck, and enterprise customers are/were realizing cost savings by getting rid of them.<p>It's hard to see this from a small/mid-size enterprise perspective. Imagine $2M in recurring licensing charges and $750k in annual consulting expenses for a product functionally similar or inferior to Nagios. Or spending $20M annually on maintenance on software that you don't use. This happens every day in the Fortune 500 and government spaces.",1310573035

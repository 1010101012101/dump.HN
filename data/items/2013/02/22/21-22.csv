At a minimum, hitting ""Like"" on something I've already clicked should ""unlike"" it.

Because a lot of these puzzle questions simply require you to think outside the box, if you're forgive the use of that phrase, and honestly if you have hard programming problems to solve that is a killer skill.<p>I have (once) had the problem where my mind locked up on a puzzle question in an interview. (Disclaimer: Usually I'm <i>really</i> good at them, but then I usually get most of the IQ questions right too...)

If you ARE willing to work with the candidate on finding the answer, and you make it clear that it's not a make-or-break question, then I think it CAN be (at least) a positive filter for awesomeness.<p>Yes, sometimes you could let someone fall through the cracks that way. Nothing about the interview process is perfect, though, and if what you really need is someone who is awesome, then letting someone get away who IS awesome is much better than serially hiring people who AREN'T awesome hoping that you find one eventually.<p>That said, and as others have pointed out in comments: 99% of the projects I hear about on HN would NOT require awesome.

However, I did not see any mention of Value, which I find to be inherently important. When it comes to User Acquisition (or I guess what we now call Growth Hacking), I believe that Value is one of the most important (and sometimes overlooked) aspects of any project. Solving real world pain points creates inherent Value, which in many cases facilitates organic growth. If your App or Service is Valuable, then people will naturally <i>want</i> to use it, no promotion necessary. I've found that the Value of a project is usually tied to the Vision of the Founders, what types of problems they want to solve, and how painful those problems are.

Social security impact of immigration falls under forced integration.<p>I can't say it better than Hans Herman Hoppe: ""First, with the establishment of a state and territorially defined state borders, immigration takes on an entirely new meaning. In a natural order, immigration is a persons migration from one neighborhood-community into a different one (micro-migration). In contrast, under statist conditions immigration is immigration by foreigners from across state borders, and the decision whom to exclude or include, and under what conditions, rests not with a multitude of independent private property owners or neighborhoods of owners but with a single central (and centralizing) state-government as the ultimate sovereign of all domestic residents and their properties (macro-migration). If a domestic resident-owner invites a person and arranges for his access onto the resident-owners property but the government excludes this person from the state territory, it is a case of forced exclusion (a phenomenon that does not exist in a natural order). On the other hand, if the government admits a person while there is no domestic resident-owner who has invited this person onto his property, it is a case of forced integration (also non-existent in a natural order, where all movement is invited).""",1361569486

Is there value in adding a component of raw intelligence to the question (say, applying a data structure in a unique and non-obvious way)? It is reasonable to expect that the act of programming fluently entails a sufficient level of IQ such that there is nothing more to be learned from attempting to craft a question that tests intelligence directly?<p>Two bits of information could potentially answer this: does intelligence as a predictor of future job success drop off past a certain level?

Certainly you have to be careful with the types of conclusions one draws from the results of such tests. But they are not useless. The probability that a candidate will work out after having solved the problem with the best and most efficient solution is certainly much higher than if she only gave a middle-of-the-road solution. They are useful as positive filters.<p>And just to be a unnecessarily technical: if you accept the premise that the combination of appropriate CS knowledge and intelligence increases the likelihood that a candidate will successfully answer the question, then the fact that they answered the question successfully increases proportionally the probability that the candidate has sufficient CS knowledge and IQ (good ol' Bayes' theorem). This then increases the probability that the candidate will be successful on the job (citation in ancestor comment). That was a long winded way of justifying these types of questions as a positive filter.",1361567792

In particular, small negative consequences borne by many economic actors adds up to legitimate negative economic consequences, even if there is a collective action problem in addressing them. In order to make the argument that there is no victim, you will have to describe how this fraud is wealth creating, without appealing to any broken window fallacies. I guarantee this is impossible.<p>In reality, the costs of fraud are shared widely, and there are definitely victims in aggregate. First, the merchants are clearly victims. In a counterfactual universe that contains no credit card fraud, merchants pay lower fees to accept credit cards, and make more money for selling the same amount of goods at the same prices. Second, consumers are definitely victims. In the same counterfactual universe, consumers pay less for goods by a tiny margin, and thus are able to consume more and achieve higher levels of utility. Additionally, in this counterfactual universe, nobody has to deal with credit card fraud, which is an inconvenience which has both a direct dollar cost, in cases where people aren't satisfied with their legal protection or incur legal costs in exercising their protection, and in non-dollar costs like having to call their bank, stress, broken relationships etc. Note that <i>these are real costs and lower standards of living and utility</i> even if they aren't dollar costs.<p>From a macro perspective, it's obvious that fraud has a negative impact on the economy. All of the effort that is spent by every fraud researcher, fraud company, credit card company fraud agent etc. is <i>fundamentally unproductive effort</i> which is nonetheless included in GDP. If these people didn't have to deal with credit card fraud, because it simply didn't exist, they could be gainfully employed in other productive fields that work to meet the hedonic goals of other humans.<p>I just want you to be aware of the tough row you have to hoe if you are really planning on going down this path, and if you ignore the above arguments, well, you aren't making a very compelling case.",1361567345

But that is water <i>long</i> under the bridge.<p>But I would describe Clojure as ""not Lispy"" because its behavior seem to fall into the compilation idea more than the interpretive idea. I would execute `lein run` and a failure would drop me out into the Linux shell. An equivalent command in CL would throw a condition and drop me into an interactive mode to patch it up.  <i>I fully acknowledge that my tool use may not have been ideal, of course.</i> But my Clojure was giving me a compile-run-test cycle as opposed to the the interactive editor/repl cycle of CL. Errors in the source would cause exceptions and crashing in the compile phase; errors in the runtime would cause a crash.<p>I want to hone in on the second point you made, in terms of new ideas.  New ideas are good (c.f., Kernel). New ideas should be aggressively pursued. I draw the line when someone has a slightly varied idea and wants to fork out something & get a community going just for that slight variance. That's just annoying and forks effort. If the new idea is really radical and can't be reconciled with extant tools, of course it deserves to be a new thing. Lisps are an insanely awesome tool for exploring semantics and I hope they keep getting created and churned on for decades to come. I just hope that the ideas which are reconcilable to production systems <i>are</i> reconciled so that we don't fragment further.",1361567058

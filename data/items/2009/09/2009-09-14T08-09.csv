821342,comment,819942,821226,0,0,lsc,,,"/secondly, the view that undercutting (for the same objective value) will always be interpreted correctly by the customer is a little naive. In reality you often don't want to undercut your competition by too much for exactly the same reason my initial post was about: perceived value./<p>The thing is, I've tried setting prices at par with the competition. Sure, it was high margin in terms of computer hardware, but computer hardware is the cheapest part of the equation.  Cutting prices dramatically is why this project went from being a net loss to paying for my rent and a new server or two every month.  It became much 'higher margin' because it's cheaper to just give everyone 4x as much ram than it is for me to compete on marketing with the other players in this field.<p>Sure, there are people I'll never appeal to, and that's fine.  There are some real reasons why you might want to pay extra to have a 'real company' handle your VPS rather than three guys.<p>I think that if you want to retain credibility, you can't pretend that you can serve everyone.<p>Besides, I'd go nuts if I had to teach unix to every middle manager who decided to sign up.  Slicehost is great. if you need a bunch of hand holding, use them.  Sure, you've gotta pay for it, but you know what?  tech support is a soul-sucking job.  It's incredibly difficult to maintain a good support organization, and I think it is quite reasonable to charge extra if you are able to do so.  (I mean, assuming slicehost's support is as good as people seem to say;  I haven't personally used them.  But  I hear nothing but good things.)<p>if you know what you are doing, and if you have a system, like mine,[1] that allows you out of band console, rebooter, and rescue media, you don't need very much support. This is good for you and good for me, and my prices just don't work, otherwise.  Hardware is cheap, good people willing to do tech support are not.<p>Objective, testable arguments appeal to my market, and 'Hey, I'm kindof like slicehost, only 25% the cost'  is a very strong, testable argument.<p>But my central point is that you should focus your marketing effort.  saying ""I am all things to all people"" is an obvious lie, which will cause most technical people to write you off as worthless marketing garbage before you get a chance to explain what you are actually good at.   Figure out what you are good at, and focus on and talk about that.    Be consistent.<p>Sure,  Perceived value is what you get paid for, but unless you are a whole lot better at marketing than I am, increasing objective value is by far the easiest way to manipulate perceived value.  Besides, increasing objective value makes me feel good about myself, and increasing perceived value without increasing objective value makes me feel kinda slimy.<p>[1] in the interests of full disclosure, and, uh, in not getting people signing up then exercising my 30 day money back thing, I will point out that my system sucks badly if you want to provision a new server, or if you want to resize your server.  I'm working on it.    But I do think my system does a very good job of emulating a remote server in a co-lo with a serial console, a rebooter, and a rescue CD in the drive.",1252917991

After all, the stuff we extract from the ground came into existence somehow in nature, and we know we are good at speeding up nature to do staff we want.<p>The two problems I see are scale and unwillingness.<p>On the one hand, the conventional wisdom say that the natural oil was made over millions and millions of years. Even if we manage to find a way to speed up nature 1000x we are in the thousands and thousands of years to regenerate the whole global reserve. At present consumption rates, know reserves will last less than 50 years. This means we would be better off developing alternate energies, reducing consumption, and reserving oil exclusively for strategic uses only (you cannot fly a plane without fossil fuels, but you can make your chairs of wood instead of plastic).<p>The other issue I see, and I belive there is no solution at all, is unwillingness from the politicians and the society in general to acknowledge the problem and do what needs to be done. Every child learns in the school that oil is a non renewable resource... and what we do? We consume more and more of the stuff every year. It is depressing to see the huge amount of utter garbage that gets made and sold out of oil, frivolous stuff, junk that nobody really loves or cares about...<p>Markets are slow to transfer information to economic actors when conditions change drastically.

I don't think there are too many people who are arguing that an animal life is the direct equivalent to a human life. I would actually argue that for animals, torture is worse than death but for adult humans the reverse is true. This is because the value of a human life is significantly greater but relative ability to feel pain is likely to be a lot more similar. It isn't really fun to logically delve too far into this which is why I guess a lot of people don't do it.",1252916644

821318,comment,821257,821303,0,0,pyre,,,"Depends on the activist. There are people that just think that the livestock industry mistreats the animals (sometimes the animals that are supposed to be knocked out make it down the 'assembly line' and are torn apart for meat while they are still alive; though one could argue they may be in shock and not feeling anything).<p>In the same way, there are many reasons that people do things like eat 'organic' meat:<p>* I don't want the animal to suffer<p>* I don't want the animal to be 'hopped up' on antibiotics (i.e. having all their food 'laced' with antibiotics)<p>* I don't want the animal to be 'bio-engineered.' (i.e. farms that 'engineer' their cattle to grow to maturity <i>very</i>  -- unnaturally -- rapidly in order to increase profits)<p>* I want the animal to have a 'good life.' (i.e. to spend 99% of their time from birth to death in a cage so small that they can't even turn around)<p>[ Unfortunately terms like 'organic' don't always mean what people think that they mean. At least in Canada (and I think the US), if an animal on an 'organic' farm gets sick and needs antibiotics, they have to go to a non-organic farm after being treated because all 'organic' livestock can't have <i>any</i> antibiotics in them. In general, I don't think that this is what people mean when they think about 'organic' farming practices, but sometimes it can be beneficial to humans -- e.g. someone that is allergic to any trace of common animal antibiotics in the meat that they eat. ]",1252916461

821313,comment,821214,821214,0,0,dkersten,,,"My vote would go to Factor[1], a Lisp-like language with Forth syntax. Factor is interesting because its an extremely powerful language with many high-level features, concatenative syntax and powerful (smalltalk inspired) development tools. It supports the usual Forth constructs, as well as higher level ones borrowed from Joy, Lisp-style macros, local variables (significant because the language is stack based), optional infix syntax and much much more. The compiler is included in compiled binaries too, so you can generate code at runtime and have it be automatically compiled. Finally, it has an extensive, clean and unit tested library - not bad for a 6 year old language!<p>Failing that, I'd choose Erlang, since multi-core programming is so important nowadays; or Oz, which is a powerful multi-paradigm language. If none of those are to you're liking, I'd suggest looking at a dataflow language, just because they're different (and, in theory at least, they deal exceptionally well with multi-core).<p>Alternatively, you could go for something completely different: Applied Type System[2]. In this language, data types play a front stage role in programming and the language provides a powerful system for defining rich data types. It supports functional, imperative, concurrent and modular programming styles and boasts to be as efficient as or more efficient than C.<p>[1] <a href=""http://factorcode.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factorcode.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/ATS/ATS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/ATS/ATS.html</a>",1252916309

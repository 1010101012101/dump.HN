Ultimately, every biological entity survives and reproduces by either growing the pie or stealing more of the pie. Human beings became dominant in part because the big brains allowed for cooperation in growing the pie, rather than just fighting each other for resources. Unfortunately, our brains are limited and this did not scale beyond the Dunbar number. The invention of rule or law and market economies helped scale this even further, as these innovations made it so that you had to create some value to exchange, rather than just stealing. But the success of those innovations just allowed the species to grow even more numerous, and the systems far, far more complex, and so market economies have broken down as so many people have found it more profitable to game the system than to create real value (gaming the system meaning everything from exploiting arcane financial structures, lobbying for government favors, building web apps to exploit natural monopoly opportunities, etc.)<p>What is the solution? My best take is that we need to refactor our laws, legal system, and financial system in order to eliminate the opportunities for complexity exploitation, and to re-incentivize value creating activities (such as basic R&D).",1394690011

7390193,comment,7387831,7388790,3,0,russell_h,,,"The guarantee you get when using an event loop (or some other cooperative concurrency model) is that inside a contiguous block of code you don&#x27;t have to worry about any other code accessing &quot;your&quot; data: until you yield control, the only code that will execute is your own.<p>Obviously if you call a function you need to be aware of what it might do to any state you grant it access to, but even then it can only mutate state either before it returns (as in most popular programming models even without concurrency) or, if it registers a callback, at some point after you yield control.<p>It takes a little bit of getting used to, but this effectively makes mutual exclusion blocks the default unit of execution - and in doing so eliminates a lot of the care needed to write correct code in a preemptive model. Take a look at a well written Node.js or Twisted app - neither Javascript nor Python has concurrent datastructures in their standard library, but it just isn&#x27;t an issue in most cases.<p>All of that being said, I think that the failure of this model is that the reason programmers tend to yield control is not because they no longer need it, but rather because you they must do so in order to avoid blocking the event loop on I/O or a timer. In other words, they need to model arithmetic, for example, fundamentally differently than they model loading a configuration file. Things get even wonkier when you start specifying interfaces without knowledge of the implementation: at some point almost any operation could require IO, even if the default implementation doesn&#x27;t, so you end up registering callbacks on every line. In addition to wreaking havoc on your mental model you have to begin worrying about stack sizes, etc.<p>In this sense, I think well written Go has a certain elegance. The programmer knows to treat shared state as a special and dangerous case. Instead, you tend to program around a produce/consume model using channels with near zero shared state. You don&#x27;t need to worry about whether a call yields to the scheduler or not, or even how many threads your goroutines map to - you just write little blocks of code that operate on easily comprehensible state.",1394688952

Everybody felt responsible for the outcome. Everybody cared. Everybody knew they could make things happen, and that differences of view were resolved through collaboration and experimentation, not power.<p>You can see that explicitly in the structure of Extreme Programming, a major Agile process. There were developers and there was a product manager (called &quot;customer&quot;), and neither controlled the other. Indeed, people created an XP bill of rights that described the balance of powers:<p><a href=""http://agile.dzone.com/articles/worth-repeating-xp-bills"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agile.dzone.com/articles/worth-repeating-xp-bills</a><p>You can see that working in the large at places like Spotify, where teams are cross-functional.

Those managers aren&#x27;t &quot;in charge&quot; in the typical sense. They mentor and support the people working directly on teams. They only really manage when things go wrong.<p>And I think that&#x27;s what the Agile community was going for early on. It&#x27;s a shame that fell by the wayside.",1394688551

It of course makes perfect sense that, at least under certain circumstances, and this was the sense of limit inferable from the email, that government agencies should be given the opportunity to assess whether the item being notified about has some security implication.<p>The claim is made by Bloomberg, by reference to &quot;two unnamed government officials&quot;, that Microsoft is aware that such information might be applied for reasons not primarily connected to domestic defensive security.

It&#x27;s also one of the few (along with Vinge&#x27;s other work) to depict distributed systems (in this sensor networks) in a realistic manner.<p>Couple of things to keep in mind though:<p>- With the exception of the spiders and two other aliens, most of the civilizations the Qeng Ho (another romanization of Zheng He, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He</a>) are human. As a result (and based on their historical and software archives), they are able to understand what drives the civilization they deal with. Even then, however, contact with some of them turns out for the worse (The Emergents in this case) at least in the short term (and by short I here I mean decades -- human life is extended due to medical advances and suspended animation, and that&#x27;s not taking into the account relativistic effects, e.g., by the time one comes back to their planet, the civilization on that planet may have already fallen).<p>- Qeng Ho is better termed as a culture: they&#x27;re certainly not a government much less an empire. The book goes very deep into this angle and I won&#x27;t go further to avoid plot spoilers.<p>- Relativistic time dilation (&quot;grandfather paradox&quot;) plays a huge role here in travel. The civilizations rely on Bussards Ramjets (which seem to be impractical, magnetic sails would be more likely) and constant acceleration and then (from half-way point) deceleration: they&#x27;re effectively marooned if they&#x27;re unable to repair or refuel their &quot;ram scoops&quot;, so they&#x27;re taking bets that whenever they reach their target, the civilization on the other end is able to repair the ships. Again, that works well if the civilizations are human: even if the civilization has fallen into barbarism (like Pham Nuwen&#x27;s home, Canberra -- where they&#x27;ve lost even radio and aircraft) it&#x27;s possible to rebuild based on archaeology, knowledge of human nature (arranging deals and trades), and (as the parent mentioned) radio communications.<p>So I think this is where the analogy fails: it&#x27;s possible to have an inter-stellar culture without faster than light travel or communications, but probably only as long as civilizations already familiar with each other are within light decades.<p>Fire Upon the Deep is quite fascinating in the sense of what is possible <i>with</i> FTL, although even there it seems that there are mostly cultures as opposed to empires (with Skroderiders -- the sci-fi aliens I want to meet most in real life! -- being the equivalent of Qeng Ho)",1394686975

Ansible kind of sits between imperative and declarative, which gives a lot of flexibility in how you merge together tasks to ultimately become idempotent. Finding just the right combination of commands is an art (I&#x27;ve seen some hacky playbooks), so having a way to grab something already built (and usually pretty polished) is awesome.<p>I kind of think of ansible as a language in itself. You&#x27;re given these tools, basic declarative and imperative functions to execute on your system, conditionals, loops, variables, and from these things you build idempotent super-functions called roles. Galaxy is just package management for ansible libraries.<p>It&#x27;s definitely not perfect (I&#x27;m not really in love with the way roles are laid out, a lot of boilerplate), and honestly I think something even <i>more</i> language like would be even better, but ansible is the best thing I&#x27;ve used so far.",1394686885

But if I was the person in charge of the decision I'd choose female. This isn't a knock against females, but there's something about a female talking deeply about something incredibly technical that I think a lot of guys will find really sexy and compelling.<p>However, I really think that the most serious metric you should be considering is charisma in general.

It's even more interesting for me, since I've been testing with various JS frameworks in the last two weeks; namely the three major ones - BackboneJS, EmberJS and AngularJS.<p>Aside from the points you've raised, here's a small conclusion I have made.<p>""Creating a complex web application with Views, Sub Views & Deep-linking is difficult, no matter what framework you use"".<p>I feel comfortable with BackboneJS because there isn't too much abstraction and convention. Therefore, once you get the hang of it, you know what you are doing (not sure if it sounds right, but it feels... pure, or purer than others).<p>But BackboneJS does in fact make me repeat a lot - which is why there are a number of plugins and other frameworks that try to cover this (e.g. Backbone Marionette, Backbone layout manager, Backbone.Subview, Backbone.Courier).<p>After 'giving up' on EmberJS, I've looked at AngularJS. Their example was quite simple and made sense. But as soon as I tried to create a complex app, I got stuck.<p>Working with these frameworks has been quite interesting, because we are trying to somehow capture the state of the app in the URL (e.g. <a href=""http://a/#b/c/1/3/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a/#b/c/1/3/2</a>) so that if that URL was bookmarked and user directly goes there, we want the web app to be able to render all the parent + child views, grab the necessary data (sometimes making sure that the order is correct) and display them as expected.<p>It's all do-able in either BackboneJS, EmberJS and AngularJS, but this type of apps are complex and I'm not sure if any one of these frameworks make it ""magic"".",1362977938

Lots of people (myself included) see it as something a business student with no real-world experience would do as their first step.<p>The reason for this is simple: you can't <i>really</i> know if users will actually like or use or pay for your product. A business plan is only going to be a bunch of guesses, the vast majority of which will turn out to be unfounded. If you think you can predict what users will like before users themselves tell you, then you should change your first name to Steve and your last name to Jobs. So instead of spending time on a business plan, the recommended route is to build a quick prototype and see how users respond to that.<p>An exception to this might be if the product you're building is something <i>you</i> need, in which case it might be excusable to build something that's more than just a prototype. Nonetheless, the same problem applies: you don't really know if <i>other</i> people will find what you build useful until you get it in front of them.",1362977708

Why should the faculty be any different?<p>I'm fairly certain they read my e-mail in 2003 (which I wrote about in my book). Judith Kidd, then a member of the administration, happened to know that I'd hired lawyers in a meeting before I had ever told her. While it's remotely possible that she learned of this from another source, I think it's highly unlikely.<p>The reason why Harvard (or any university) is not your average employer is that academic institutions, and particularly those with big brand names, are supposed to be beacons of free speech in this country. Professors should be able to discuss or investigate pretty much any [legal] topic they want to without fear of censorship or other repercussions. The notion that the administration could spy on faculty (or students for that matter) without notice could have potential chilling effects that are actually fairly serious.<p>But am I surprised?

Attempts at understanding language through precision is precisely why AI has failed miserably when it comes to actual understanding of language. I promise you that figuring out how to model all the various contexts and connotations that are associated with language is the big breakthrough that natural language processing has been waiting for.<p>That being said, one can have a precise discussion regarding these admittedly emotional topics if we clearly define all of the relevant contexts that are involved. But anyways, this has suddenly turned into a discussion about race unintentionally. So instead of going into great depth, I will cut to the point which will hopefully clarify my problem with your type of reasoning.<p>Words like racist and sexist have a certain power in our culture. If you call someone a racist, they immediately become defensive because it has become one of the worst things you can call someone. <i>This is precisely because of the connotations involving hate, inferiority, violence, etc.</i> Now when you attempt to prune all of that cultural context from that word (by defining it as generic discrimination based on race), and then label programs geared towards minorities ""racist"", you are intentionally wielding that cultural context to stigmatize something that would not otherwise receive that negative connotation. <i>You are changing the definition without simultaneously changing the cultural connotations that give the word its power.</i> This is what is so despicable about altering the meaning of these words: you are using unconscious associations between racism and evil things to stigmatize things you simply don't like by forcing a new association in the minds of your audience by way of the old label. The ""evil"" connotation is then unconsciously transferred to the thing you don't like.<p>A clear example of how the degenerate definition is useless, and frankly absurd, is the case of doctors that check black patients for high blood pressure, heart disease, hypertension, etc. This is your ""technical"" definition of racial discrimination, ie ""racism"". But it is absurd that this should carry a negative stigma by falling under such a label.<p><i>Without proper context, words lose all meaning.</i>",1362976418

I think a lot more women than men simply end up not having an interest in the field due to larger societal issues with gender roles and the way we raise our children and the paths put in front of them, and <i>this</i> is a problem worth solving and programs like this help break those assumptions down.

5354850,comment,5354366,5354764,12,0,lambda,,,"""Revenge porn"" is posting pornographic pictures of your exes (or other people of whom you have such pictures, and don't have permission to post it publicly). The idea being that you shame your exes by posting your dirty photos of them from when you were dating. Apparently the sites also include real names and hometowns of the people posted, or in some cases even addresses and phone numbers, to increase the chances of them being embarrassed by people who know them finding the pictures.<p>This particular defamation suit has nothing to do with revenge porn per se. It just happens that the founder of a revenge porn website is a huge asshole, and started making (presumably) baseless accusations of pedophilia against someone who campaigns against cyber bullying and who helped shut down his first revenge porn site. The details are a bit more complicated, but that's the gist.<p>So the defamation lawsuit is about his pedophilia accusation, not anything directly to do with the revenge porn sites, though I think there are some other pending privacy lawsuits about them too.",1362974785

I love computers and IT, but didn't have passion for what I was doing. I was passionate about history and writing, and ended up with a dual major that was fun for me (I had a great in history), even with hardly any time investment. I stuck with CS because I had no interest in academia/teaching/law or other things that a History degree helps with.<p>I adopted a system like what this guy did... I was actually detained by campus security in the final for one of my ""E1"" classes because the professor had never seen me and thought I was taking the test for someone.<p>That meant that I wasn't going to be working for a top tier technology company.

Setting aside the fundamental philosophy, I'd say I probably agree with you regarding the wording; namely, that the term ""buying"" must be removed needn't be the remedy. I think Algorias put it well by instead stating that the term ""license"" must be included in the marketing, whether one states ""buy a license to this product"" or else elects to shorten it to ""license this product.""

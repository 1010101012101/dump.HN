Apparently the most important factor was that Mercurial was the favorite choice in the Python community. That's probably because Mercurial is written in Python, and was used by a lot of Python projects.<p>Also Git didn't work very well under Windows at the time if I remember correctly.",1298257104

And as an example of such horrible nesting he proposed something like:<p><pre><code>  some_list = [some_function(blah)\n               for blah in some_other_function()\n               if some_condition(blah)]\n</code></pre>\nWhat this says to me is that this guy didn't get list comprehensions at all and didn't want to. Sure enough, there's no nesting whatsoever going on here.  He was just scared by non-C++-like syntax.<p>My point is: popularity, though desirable in itself, is a poor measure of anything else.  Most people run away from good things for no valid reason.<p>(Not saying there are no valid reasons why Lisp is not more popular, only that none would really be needed.  Obscurity is quite a stable default.)",1298256486

But, with my fairly limited background I would like to suggest you think of the the law as a fuzzy logic problem not a Boolean one.  If (A)(B)(C) are each 40-60% true a judge will often rule basted on the assumed intent of the law and without clear precedence the side with the better argument tends to win.  So the question becomes in what ways do each side present the situation and attack each others arguments.<p>Inference: ""Circumvent"" means to bypass or disable so any method that disables protection must therefore also ""Circumvent"" it.<p>Rebuttal : If ""circumvent"" implied simply disable then you would not be able to turn a PS3 off or damage it.  Melting down old PS3's and selling them for scrap and novelty bookshelves would destroy the DMCA protection, but the modified device is not going to break copyright law.<p>Counter Inference:  That's an <i>argument from absurdity</i> we are not arguing about an inter object but a device capable of running copyrighted software illegally.<p>Counter Rebuttal:  A 300$ general purpose computer may also run come copyrighted software illegally. However both the modified PS3 and the cheap computer run the same range of Sony's protected software without significant further modifications.  We can even demonstrate that running PS1 games is simpler on the computer.<p>etc on down the rabbit hole.",1298256124

The disagreement between RMS and myself indeed comes down to my personal definition of ""freedom"" and my personal views on intellectual property protection. I have indeed heard your argument before, and I suppose I can concede that RMS's philosophy is internally logical given his definition/usage of ""freedom.""<p>Still, I find the GPL to be more restrictive and less free than the public domain, and therefore less desirable. I take issue with the way RMS and GNU uses the words ""free"" and ""freedom"" because I see their philosophy not as a principled desire for freedom, but rather merely as a desire for certain restrictions on freedom (granted, a different set of restrictions than proprietary software licenses).<p>I think that ""The Free Software Movement"" is an unfortunate title. Not only do they have to constantly remind average readers of their definition of ""free as in speech, not as in beer,"" they also should be clarifying their definition of ""free"" for people like myself who believe that freedom is an utmost concern.

I'm just pissed.<p>Yeah, I hear those common ""excuses"" for not doing TDD/BDD. I also heard why we need to use BDD, then followed by ATDD, instead of just TDD. I also know the stories of Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and other startups that hire super-hot-shot developers, feed them with pizzas and coke so they can stay up all night writing code (<i>cough</i>, I mean, fixing bugs from the code they wrote this afternoon without unit-tests...<i>cough</i>).<p>I mean, here's the thing, if you're in this for the money and fame, then perhaps you should be honest and say it what it is: ""I don't give a F* about the technology and methodology, I just want to make something people want and get rich. I wanna hire the best developers out there to deliver me a working code while I make decision about the product development and business decisions"".<p>Don't give me the crap about ""Changing the world!"". You don't plan to change the world, it's accidental. Nobody knows how to change the world. If you know how to change the world then you're probably some sort of god or something.<p>Here's another thing: I don't care whether you use TDD, BDD, ATDD, DDD, XXDD. I don't. What I'd like to know is that can you write a unit-test to prevent that stupid bug you caused so that we can detect it faster during build-time when someone had to modify something that may or may not affect your code? Don't give me excuses like:<p>""Oh we can't write unit-test around there because it has hard-dependencies with a WebService/DB"",<p>""Oh we need to bring up the Web Server because we can't run the tests without it""<p>""it takes a lot of time, like 2-3 days to get to the point where we can write the unit-tests, and we might break some stuffs along the way"".<p>If I keep hearing these kind of excuses, I'll grab an unused keyboard and drag such developer to the server room. We're going to have a grown-up chat. Nobody will come out from the room unless my point sticks in the devs's ass. Either that or until there's no more keys in the keyboard. I'll bury that developers with books about testing.<p>How many times we heard the stories that a hot technology companies growth were uncontrollable and at some point, everything just fall down. Fixing bugs becoming a drag. The earlier supposedly ""hot/superb"" developers have left because things were not going well... and eventually the company dies. Then HN crowds starting to have a long discussions of the blame game: is it the tech? is it the leadership? is it the business models? is it the culture? is it the building? the aeon chair?<p>I find it funny that the hot-shot developers always left after the initial rush is gone. You know, when they have to deal with the shitty code they wrote? remember that time? Nah, they just left for another startups and we (or at least I) thought they were the cool developers: the ""it"" team"", the ""dream"" team, the ""3 small productive team by the corner that left because they were no longer respected"". All we heard is that they left because the ""culture was no longer acceptable"" or because ""management made mistakes"". I mean... c'mon... we're grown ups. These hotshots developers were part of the problem too.<p>I just want developers to act like a grown-up. Man-up, fix that code. Make sure the bug won't show up again in production, if it does, I'll fire your ass. Don't give me BS. Clean up your own mess. Don't run away. Don't blame management. Educate the management.<p>Often people point out that ""don't worry, we'll get the market first then we'll clean up"".  How often that'll happen? The chances that will happen is probably 1:20 or 1:50. Most often, the developers have to live with the stuff for the rest of their careers in that company.<p>I also find it ironic that many people would give their 2cents (no, more like their 99cents) especially when they're NOT involved in the situations. When they are actually involved in such situation, I bet my career that they're actually screaming, kicking, punching, and yelling for changes, or for better methodologies/processes, or <i>gulp</i> writing unit-tests. Or they simply quit their job.<p>Don't pain a picture that points out how long it takes to write unit-tests. If it takes too long, you're doing it wrong!. Cut your HN addiction and start writing those unit-tests. If you need to throw away the code, throw away the unit-tests as well. It took me less than 5 minutes to write a single unit-test. It took me less than 5 minutes to delete unused code (both production and unit-tests).<p>Yes, I am painting a generalization with a gold brush. This is what happening in our industry. Don't act like it's a minor problem.<p>I'm really passionate about this field. But sometime I am considering to join the hotest startup as tech-lead or management (doesn't matter, as long as I don't have to deal with craps at 3 AM in the morning), get rich and call it a day, be an angel, sit down on conferences, just talk, talk, and talk, following the superstars that HN-ers always praised (the likes of jwz, pg). One successful exit and people will pray like you're some sort of god or something. They'll quote you forever.<p>Feels good to rant. It's been a while.<p>PS: No, I'm not ranting because I hate my job. In fact, I'm in a good position right now where people write unit-tests without even being told to.",1298254333

We are illusions of ourselves, running on a largely hacked-together substrate made of meat.<p>I used to put the position that the drugs are over-prescribed, that it's a societal problem etc. But I don't feel that way any more, because thinking like that was another reason that I did not seek treatment. I basically lost my 20s to this disease, I don't want others to suffer as I did.<p>If that means erroneously attacking a few false positives on HN, so be it.",1298254273

It was finally ready and launched last month.  I'm trying to build a community to help people classified ads via video.  I believe if everyone can watch videos of what people are selling they can save so much time traveling from place to place to check out the product.  They can enjoy watching classified ads videos without leaving the comfort of their homes.  It's like craigslist but by videos instead of posting photos.  It's been about 1 month, we have about 200 members signed up but not many actually uploading videos.  I'm thinking of running a contest to encourage them to upload their unwanted things lying around their houses.  Are there any other ways for them to start uploading videos?  Plus how can I get more users to join a site like this.  \nI'm a bit new on marketing for a startup website and looking forward to learn from you guys.  Please review my website and provide me some tips.  If you don't like anything about the site please let me know so i can fix it to better serve users.<p>Thanks  \nHttp://www.123exchanges.com",1298254245

The else clause can't go in the same line.<p>I get your point, though.  Python's scope is not in terms of literally 'indentation' blocks.  Scope units are: module toplevel, and (possibly nested) function and class definitions.  To create a new scope you create a new function.  This is what Lisp does too (you can define let as a macro over lambda).<p>I have oscillated between liking either way better and at present I find Python's sloppier way more practical.",1298254091

Sure, I know if I succeeded in proving what I set out to prove, but is there a better way I could have proved the same thing?<p>It's like if I learned to code, and had unit tests to check correctness, but did not have anyone to critique my code style. Maybe I'm passing all the tests but my code is ugly and could be made a lot better?<p>This may not be a problem in all courses, but it certainly is starting to be a problem in the higher level mathematical courses that I'm learning.<p>OCW is fantastic, and I hope a companion site comes up where a student can ask questions to experts (even on ""simple topics"" and homework problems -- which rules out MathOverflow).",1298253740

They simply allowed cheating. So, at the beginning of every exam an examiner announced something like: ""Ladies and gentlemen. You are allowed to cheat. You can browse your books and notes,
no questions asked. But I must warn you that exam tasks are designed such a way, that they require thinking - and thinking is not compatible with cheating, because thinking is fast and cheating is quite slow. So, you are allowed to cheat, but if you will it is very likely that you will not complete minimum number of tasks required to pass the exam.

China would probably be ok with a unified Korea as the lesser problem. The DPRK is not exactly helping China currently, except making them look good in comparison. But the problem with North Korean belligerence is that it serves as a strong motivation for militarization of the whole region. China may be hesitant of a unified Korean peninsula but on the other hand the continued existence of the DPRK regime gives excuse for a strong American presence in South Korea and could lead to escalations in the region the Chinese don't want (a nuclear armed Korea or Japan?)

1933154,comment,1932821,1932821,0,0,patio11,,,"I sold a Java-based program for about four years and have a previous background in Big Freaking Enterprise Java Web Development.<p>You can certainly write web applications in Java.  They're harder to deploy than PHP but easier to deploy than Rails, in my experience, depending <i>heavily</i> on how experienced you are at administering systems and how much Java enterprise coffee you want to drink.<p>Java is a mature language.  Libraries exist for almost any task you reasonably want to accomplish.  There are skilled Java-speaking programmers in your area.  Whatever you doing has almost certainly been done in Java already, and it has probably already been documented extensively.  Java is an opinionated language: it is of the opinion that your workflow should resemble IBM's more than it does 37Signals', and if that is true, you and Java will get along nicely together.<p>There, mandatory praise out of the way.  Java is <i>horrifically maladapted</i> to certain classes of problems and certain classes of users.  One class of problem is expressively operating on strings to produce other strings.  One class of users is anybody with a team size less than ten.  Many web startups have a small team which is primarily interested in turning strings into other strings: if this is you, Java is going to fight you <i>every step of the way</i>.<p>99% of web application development for a certain type of business is turning strings into other strings.  Many web development languages/frameworks popular with startups give you very expressive options for churning out certain types of strings quickly and with little cognitive load.  For example, in Rails, there is very vanishingly little work in taking a bunch of strings from the blog_posts table and turning them into strings which encode a blog post into HTML.  And if you want to add special strings that cause comments to be loaded in an AJAXy fashion, that is quick, too.  Want to make sure that the strings the user is commenting with include certain strings which look like email addresses?  Add one line to your program, and bam, if someone puts in a bad string they get a red string telling them how to make it a good string.  It is all string rainbows and string unicorns.  If you fat-finger your one line, it is very possible that large portions of your site will instantly break, but that is OK because if you program like everyone else using Rails programs, your magic guardian angel strings will get your attention before you deploy, and after you fix your typo everything is rainbows and unicorns again.<p>There are many Java frameworks.  They can all operate on strings and produce other strings.  However, the experience of actually doing this is maddening: pulling off the above you-give-me-bad-strings-I-give-you-red-strings can be a matter of touching six files or more, often written in painstaking configuration formats.  The frameworks assume you are guilty of incompetence and force you to repeatedly prove you are otherwise, the better to prevent idiots like you from taking the site down.<p>This is a problem for startups because <i>web startups are not about turning strings into other strings</i>: that is just what they <i>do</i>.  Web startups are about finding a problem people will pay money to solve.  That is where they ideally spend most of their efforts.  Sometimes, those explorations require code to be written, and when code gets written it should be quick to write, quick to test, quick to deploy, and quick to rip out when you discover your users don't respond the way you thought they would.<p>Java as it is practiced in the real world looks at that list of requirements and sees Very Scary Things.",1290504985

The DPRK stays a basket case and continues lashing out locally but nothing major happens.<p>2. Hot war breaks out (precipitated by the DPRK or the South or the US), the North loses fairly quickly, there are catastrophic civilian casualties in the South and the North and perhaps elsewhere (e.g. the North launches a nuke or chemical weapons or what-have-you against Japan or the US, just 'cause it can), American military losses are comparatively minor in comparison to everything else. Ultimately, the industrial base and economy of the Korean peninsula is in shambles and is all the worse for having to deal with bringing the North into the 20th (let alone 21st) century, despite lots of foreign aid it's still a shitty situation for a lot of people for a long, long time.<p>3. The DPRK regime falls from within relatively peacefully. The North and South reunite and a crap-ton of effort and struggle is necessary to bring the North out of the dark ages. It's a crappy situation except for the Northerners who had been abused and/or starving, but it's still a hell of a lot better than option 2.<p>4. China forces the DPRK regime to step down through some means and takes over control of North Korea (either via direct annexation or through proxy control). Hostilities in the region diminish greatly and conditions improve for the North Koreans. It's a crappy situation but still better than option 1 or 2.<p>There are lots of other things that could happen, of course, but I think these options take up the bulk of the probability space.",1290504299

Our use of Java has definitely been successful.<p>If your observation is based on reading HN, likely it's a bit skewed.  Paul Graham has bashed Java and Java programmers quite a bit in his writings: ""The programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as smart as the ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.""<p>That said, I would have to agree that Java is not the language of choice for small startups.  There is a lot of overhead involved in setting up a Java project compared to other languages/platforms, and the problems that Java is best at solving aren't usually the problems you run into in a small web app (unless you're dealing with a lot of data).<p>Java isn't as fun to use as newer languages, and doesn't have the vibrant community that Ruby and Python do (even if you include JVM based languages like Scala and Groovy).  Java doesn't attract creative types.  A web designer looking to pick up a first backend programming language is probably not going to choose Java, and thus they aren't going to create beautiful documentation repositories, fun open source projects, organize meetups, or create the next revolutionary social app.<p>However, there is a reason that so many large startups start to lean on Java once they reach scale.

There's a qualitative difference between (i) a mouse killed accidentally by a combine, (ii) a lab rat killed by a drug company, (iii) a pig raised and killed to be eaten, (iv) a mink killed for its fur and (v) an endangered mountain gorilla killed so a collector can stuff its head and hands. Different people draw their moral lines at different places.<p>A lot of people might have a problem with (v) but be okay with (i) through (iv). I can personally live with (i) and (ii), but have a problem with (iii) especially given the messed up fact that while almost a billion people on the planet are malnourished, the US has enough excess to give the majority of its soy and corn crops over to feeding livestock. As in, we're literally choosing to feed the pigs, cows and chickens we're going to kill before we feed the poor. I know of people who will accept (ii) if the research is for a compelling medical cause, but not if it's for something like cosmetics. I know plenty of people who can live with leather, but won't accept fur based on the crazy cruel stuff that happens on fur farms.<p>This stuff isn't black and white. You can't just equate animals that died millions of years ago that turned into oil with animals that we raise to kill; not all animal deaths are equal. The ethical and moral questions get <i>complicated</i>, and there's a lot of grey areas encountered when balancing human needs and desires against the potential suffering of creatures whose subjective experience we can't understand. And then there are health arguments and environmental arguments, and it never ends. Given that it's complicated, please have a little respect.<p>You write as though you expect that vegetarians and vegans must not be aware of natural predators or animals killed unintentionally by humans for reasons other than meat, or the weird, myriad ways we use highly processed animal products in the modern world -- and that if we had been aware we should obviously have come to the same conclusions you did. That presumption, that vegetarians and vegans must have made their life decisions out of simple ignorance of the facts, is a bit offensive. I'm not saying you should believe anything different about eating meat. But please don't flippantly talk down to people who have chosen to draw their moral distinctions in different places than yours.",1290503833

I've used a lot of different languages so far (from C to Haskell), and I've always avoided Java in the past (at the beginning because it was slow, later because everyone was telling me how bloated it is).<p>But using Java EE (!) instead of Python for a project a few months ago was really an enlightenment. Yes, it is somewhat bloated (although much less in the recent versions where you can use annotations instead of all those XML files). But on the other hand: It just works - exactly as documented.<p>With all other frameworks (based on Python, Ruby, etc.) that I've used so far I had to hack around in the framework or in the libraries to make it work the way I want. This starts with simple issues such as Unicode support, where the authors of a library obviously just didn't care if it works, and continues with distributed transactions, where you have to hack up the whole logic inside your application because the framework doesn't support them. Compared to this, with Java (EE) this just works rock stable and has most of the features you'll ever need.<p>From a performance perspective Java isn't that bad as either. For a project I've compared the performance of two simple (comparable) Web apps that I've wrote: One with Python on Django, the other one with Java on Glassfish). Once you increase the concurrency, the requests to the Django app just return error codes or take a long time to complete. In comparison, the Glassfish app just chucks happily along.<p>This does not mean that Java is appropriate for all use cases.

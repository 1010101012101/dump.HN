In fact, Moore said that the NUMBER of transistors on a processor would double roughly every 18 months.<p>It turns out that they are correlated, since smaller transistors means both faster transistors and more transistors per unit of area.<p>My point is that more processor cores require more transistors, and thus the end of Moore's Law also means the end of more processor cores (ignoring things like architectural advancements or more but less powerful cores)<p>That said, I do agree that we will see an increasing number of cores, at least for awhile.<p>First of all, it's important to have an OS that efficiently manages the cores and the applications that run on them.  This automatically benefits everyone who runs multiple applications on a multi-core machine, since each application gets a larger slice of time and fewer context switches.<p>Multiple cores could also eliminate dedicated components like GPUs which would bring down the cost of low end machines.<p>As far as programming languages go, I hear Erlang is good for concurrency, though I've never used it.",1194248737

If I wasn't raised here I probably wouldn't have gotten interested in startups. You read about this stuff every day in the newspapers, and when you drive around on the highways you pass by the offices of hundreds of companies. As a programmer and an aspiring entrepreneur, I don't think I'd be happy anywhere else. <p>SoCal is also great. I was in a high school business club and we used to go down there all the time for conferences. Santa Monica, San Diego, etc. all kick ass. The way I think of it is, NorCal is where you go to work, and SoCal is where you go to vacation.<p>Like I said, I really don't see myself living anywhere else in the world besides California. I just wish Berkeley students were more enthusiastic about startups.",1194246759

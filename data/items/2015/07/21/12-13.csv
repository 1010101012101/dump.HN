It is entirely likely that the article source&#x27;s manager and the next manager above him/her disliked the spreadsheet while the &quot;official HR position&quot; on the matter was given at some kind of large meeting.<p>I work at an enterprise with ~5,000 employees, and attitudes toward topics like transparency vary wildly, even in cases where there is an official company stance.  This is because it is common to give managers a lot of freedom to manage their departments without interference.  So, for example, our company has a pretty good work-from-home policy, but your manager is completely allowed to ban it in your department if he or she feels like it.<p>Basically, it is possible that both sources are mostly accurate, and they represent the perspectives from different parts/levels of the company at Google.",1437483515

What matters is getting fair market value for your worth. Many people make less then what they are worth because they either don&#x27;t know how much they are worth, or are even too afraid to argue for what they feel they are worth. Companies exploit this and use salary negotiations as a way to hire employees for the absolute least amount possible.<p>We applaud companies for making record breaking profits, but we don’t applaud them for decreasing their profits a bit in favor of increasing all their employees spending power.",1437483475

That way the salary is roughly set before the gender, race, height, physical attractiveness (i.e. any qualities that can cause unconscious bias) is known about whatever candidate a company eventually hires.<p>Obviously it wouldn&#x27;t outright prevent negotiating - you could still ask for $15k above what they listed in the job posting - but it WOULD help candidates navigate some of the smaller moments during the interview process that can unknowingly undermine their negotiating position (e.g. &quot;How much did you make in your last role?&quot;).",1437483410

It&#x27;s very clear that entire meta-categories of horrific errors are being made at a very fundamental level.  Is this a problem of outsourcing?  Of confusing &quot;coders&quot; with engineers?<p>And how do we solve it?  Shame the software team such that they can never get hired in a serious role again anywhere?

Back in 2000 (ish), when I switched to Linux the biggest confusion was the different format of configuration files and scripts. In Windows, I get used to .ini files and .bat batch scripts. When I switched to Linux (well, it was more like a slow process) I was confused about this. Fetchmail config format, the apt sources tree format (which seemed to be an .ini) and all the config files in /etc was all different. I finally managed to get my emails fetched and sorted to different folders based on topic and sender, using Fetchmail, then I was happy to read them in Mutt. The UI looked terrible (well, it was text after all) so I tried Balsa and used it for years, then Sylpheed, Claws Mail, still backed with Fetchmail. I can imagine that the different GUI libraries would confusing others, but I always managed to sort my installation to use only one. If I had KDE, I installed only KDE or at least Qt programs. If I had GNOME, then so that it. Nowadays, I use AwesomeWM mainly with 3 or 4 software only, on 3 screens: the first screen is the terminal with tmux, the second (middle) is the browser, Thunderbird, the third is Sublime, so I don&#x27;t get nervous about installing different libraries.<p>With all of these, Linux felt better than Windows and it&#x27;s openness and community support encouraged me to discover more and more. Back in those days I really tried every programming language I could: Java, Ruby, C, C++ and I had no confusion learning and using these on Linux. I was only confused when sometimes I had to switch back to Windows. The lack of documentation, missing libraries, unpredictable crashes on software upgrades (which came from different sources, absolutely without automation, manually running setup.exe&#x27;s) and different UX, unsought taskbar icons really annoyed me. Now if I sit in front of a Windows PC, I feel it&#x27;s just an useless gadget.<p>Linux was the cause I became a software developer.<p>I have only experience with one IDE, which was Netbeans. I used it mostly for developing Rails applications and I found this was the only IDE which does not get in my way. I just can&#x27;t get used to PHPStorm today and I found Eclipse too slow, so I&#x27;m using Sublime as my primary editor now. Before it was Geany, gEdit or just Vim.

I love reading biographies and hanging out on history forums.<p>As we&#x27;re getting to the 50-year mark past the American involvement in Vietnam, things are progressing in ways not anticipated at the time. Vietnam, like several other Asian countries, is embracing capitalism and entrepreneurs. Old enemies hug and pose for photographs.<p>This seems to be a pattern, at least among American conflicts (I have not studied others very much). As the combatants grow into old age, it&#x27;s not worth carrying a grudge around. Things that were worth dying and killing for 50 years ago are still important, but they&#x27;re fights for young people. It becomes easier to see things from the other side.<p>I&#x27;d argue that by simply having a huge presence of Americans in Vietnam for so many years, the two countries have become joined for the next century or so, much the same as having kids in a marriage joins the two partners together even if they can&#x27;t stand one another. I also note that things may end up turning out better for Vietnam in terms of economic development than if South Vietnam had won the war -- which would have only institutionalized worse corruption than they currently have.<p>This is all speculative, of course, but I seriously doubt anybody in the mid-70s would have guessed that this is where we&#x27;d all be 40 years later. It&#x27;s been an interesting journey for both countries.",1437481182

9921654,comment,9921335,9921335,0,0,thesch,,,"a thing bothered me yesterday and it&#x27;s still bothering me today and so now i want to tell a story.<p>One Sunday, some former coworkers & I were bored, talking about salaries on the internal social network instance. A spreadsheet was created. we put our salaries in the sheet, realized that it was created on a public to the world spreadsheet, so I copied it to internal. I then put a form on it and posted the link to the form and the spreadsheet on my internal social network account.<p>It took off like wildfire.<p>It got reshared all over the place. People started adding pivot tables that did spreadsheet magic that highlighted not great things re: pay. I did some general housekeeping stuff to the sheet (normalizing the gender field where it could be, exchange rate stuff, that sort of thing).<p>More reshares.<p>More people adding pay.<p>It became a thing.<p>I was invited to talk to my manager on Mon or Tues. Higher up people weren&#x27;t happy. She wasn&#x27;t happy. Why did I do it? &quot;Don&#x27;t you know what could happen?&quot; Nothing. It&#x27;s illegal to retaliate against employees for sharing salaries. &quot;Wellll....&quot;.<p>Meeting ended.<p>Sheet kept going.<p>People were thanking me for it. They were also sending me peer bonuses. here&#x27;s how peer bonuses work @ former co:<p>If you did something good, someone peer bonuses you, you get $150 net in your next paycheck. An important thing I learned during that time: peer bonuses are rewarded at managers discretion. My manager was rejecting all of them. Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be good for the company. Wanted to see what the outcome was. Mind you once a PB is rejected, that can&#x27;t be undone.<p>Meanwhile, one of the other people involved, a white dude (good friend I won&#x27;t name, he can name himself if he wants), was also getting PBs. His weren&#x27;t getting rejected. I told him mine were. He was pissed. Wanted to tell everyone what was happening. I declined. A smattering of people knew what was going on. Backchannels being what they are at former co. (lol IRC #yallknowwhoyouare), it got around. Rejecting PBs was so unheard of, ppl didn&#x27;t know it was possible. There was outrage when they found out. Shock that I wasn&#x27;t talking abt it. Meanwhile, spreadsheet still going, getting spread around, pointed questions being thrown at mgmt about sharing salary ranges (hahah no). Most people agreed that it was A Good Thing. PBs kept rolling in. Rejections kept rolling out. One PB eventually got approved. Way after everything died down. Because the person worded it in a way that was vary vague. Any that were outright about the spreadsheet got rejected. 7 total in the end I think?<p>Higher ups still pissed. Some I used to support as an exec tech would pointedly not interact w/ me anymore. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Before I left, about 5% of former co. had shared their salary on that sheet. People asked for & got equitable pay based on data in the sheet. The world didn&#x27;t end. Everything didn&#x27;t go up in flames because salaries got shared. But shit got better for some people.<p>I explicitly gave ownership of the sheet to someone else before I left so it couldn&#x27;t be taken over by mgmt when I was gone (can happen).<p>I am thinking of this because of everyone celebrating the fact that Google put Ida B. Wells in the doodle yesterday. Ida B. Wells was great. She did stuff to affect change of such a magnitude that if I&#x27;m half the woman she was, I&#x27;m doing pretty good. I don&#x27;t claim to come close, but from time to time, I do stuff that will make things better for people at the expense of the establishment. I&#x27;m a pretty big believer in justice and fairness and will fight for both if necessary. Fighting for justice & fairness INSIDE Google doesn&#x27;t go over well. Salary sharing is only 1 example. Blogger porn. Real names. Many others. Shit WILL hit the fan if you tell a racist (a well documented racist) to go fuck themselves though. In defense of the racist, obvi. So sure. Rah rah, Google did an Ida B. Wells doodle. Guaranteed that if Ida Wells were alive & working at Google today, there&#x27;d be many private calendar meetings focused on &quot;her future&quot; there.<p>tl;dr the sharing of one doodle does not a bastion of support for justice and civil disobedience make.",1437481046

For a long time, I didn&#x27;t really have an opinion on LW both as a community nor as a philosophical framework. I do consider myself a transhumanist, though. There are three concepts I do know from and about LW: their take on rationality, the top secret AI unboxing strategy, and the Basilisk.<p>I have a very poor opinion of the concept of the Basilisk (and yes, as someone pointed out, that opinion is basically the same as the one I have about Pascal&#x27;s wager) - a concept that has been given additional, undeserved credibility by the reactions of Yudkowsky and LW.<p>As for the AI escape chat, it&#x27;s a social experiment. People can be talked into making mistakes, or at least making risky judgement calls, whether they operate on a rational framework or not. I have no problem with that thesis. What I object to is the &quot;magic trick&quot; aura surrounding this experiment, including the insinuation that at the core there is an argument so profound and unique and potent, it cannot be allowed to escape Yudkowsky&#x27;s head. Oh, and by the way, the trick can <i>never</i> be repeated, but all you laymen out there are welcome to devise your own version at home. This whole thing comes across as humongously self-important: there is a secret truth that has been privately revealed to our leader.<p>To me, and I recognize I may well be alone with this opinion, the more rational assumption is there is no such magical argument at all, and the prime reason for not publicizing it is to prevent it from deflation by public critique, in the same way the inventor of a perpetuum mobile device will keep the inner workings of his contraption a closely held secret because ultimately the device doesn&#x27;t exist as stated. The amazing part of this very old trick is that, even in 2015, it still works on otherwise smart people.<p>I get that my opinions on both the Basilisk and the AI Chat are extreme outliers, and to my knowledge I have never met anyone who shares them - it would probably have been advisable to keep them to myself, but honestly I wanted to see if like-minded people exist.",1437480599

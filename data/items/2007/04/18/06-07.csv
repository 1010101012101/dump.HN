Second, he may be able to find a matching partner looking for his expertise. WorkIt.com is an excellent resource if your friend is in Bay Area.<p>Another idea is to tell your friend to provide contracting services for start-ups. That way, he/she can test-drive the company while making a few bucks on the side.",1176878928

Figure out a way to get a conversation. Start with startups likely to be using technologies you know. It does not need to lead immediately to a job, just get the ball rolling. Founders know other startup founders.<p>It definitely helps if you're genuinely interested in startups and what they're doing and look forward to talking to good hackers yourself. ",1176878193

Investors are also looking too, since that's one way they can really help their companies.  So he can find cool startups and email them, or find cool investors (like YC) and work from higher up in the stream.<p>My startup, Xobni, is very actively looking for great hackers.  We are YC alumni and recently raised a series A financing from Khosla Ventures.  We're still a small team, too, so all of the benefits of working for a startup are in full force here.  You can email jobs foo at xobni dot com (remove foo)!<p>\nAdam",1176877673

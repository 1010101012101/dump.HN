I&#x27;ve been thinking that having your content in an API (or markdown or text files in the case of static site generators), using HTML for the layout (inline styles maybe, or JS driven positioning), and CSS for the styling of the content creates a more flexible and future friendly flow. Then stylesheets could be far simpler. Layout needs to move to a new layer of the stack perhaps.",1412953165

If the company has a problem with the work that you&#x27;re doing or views your role within the company differently to you, they need to tell you as soon as possible so that corrective action can be implemented. Likewise if your salary is not sufficient, or there are other aspects that you feel are lacking such as training etc, communicate it early! Don&#x27;t necessarily expect though that the company can implement a solution immediately, that may only happen as part of the employee review process itself, but at least now they&#x27;re aware of the issue and can make any necessary adjustments to the budget before it&#x27;s locked in for the year.<p>If neither party communicates their expectations on remuneration or job function, resentment builds up and someone snaps.

When a write is done to a file in a dataset with dedup=on, a lookup is done on the data deduplication table. If the lookup finds an entry, it increments a reference. If it does not find an entry, it creates one. This involves 3 random seeks and consequentially your total write throughput is [average record size * IOPS / 3 random seeks]. If you have sufficient memory that the entire DDT can stay cached, then we avoid this limit.<p>The 1GB of RAM for every 1TB of storage is a rule of thumb for avoiding this limit that someone made a very long time ago. Unfortunately, that rule is wrong because it is impossible to estimate memory requirements by such a simple rule, but it has stuck with us for years despite being wrong.<p>The amount of memory needed to store a DDT is a function of the average record size. If your dataset has the default recorsize=128K (e.g. you are storing many >1MB files), then you can multiply your system memory by 153.6 to determine the total amount of unique data that you can store before hitting the limit I described. If you are storing many small <128KB files, then you need to calculate the average file size and then calculate [average file size * system memory * 12 / 10355] to obtain the total amount of unique data. This assumes the module settings for zfs_arc_max and zfs_arc_meta_max were left at their ZoL defaults. It is important to keep in mind that the unique data is different from total data, especially in the case of duplicate files. It also excludes metadata required for maintaining indirect block trees, dnodes (i.e. inodes), directories and the DDT itself.<p>The total amount of data that you can store on a pool before hitting the limit is [unique data * deduplication multipler], where unique data is what I described how to calculate and the deduplication multipler is a number that is either 1 or greater. A measure of the deduplication multipler is provided by `zpool list` as DEDUP, so you should be able to see that yourself. If your pool has data that was written without dedup=on, then any duplicates in that data will be counted as unique data for the purposes of that calculation. To provide a simple example of the deduplication multipler, imagine a pool with only two files that store the same data. The deduplication multipler for that pool would be 2, provided that both were written with dedup=on set on their dataset. If one or both were written with dedup=off, then the deduplication multiper would be 1. You can use zdb to calculate the theoretical deduplication statistics for an entire pool by running `zdb -D $POOLNAME`. Note that this will require significant memory because it constructs a full DDT in userland memory.",1412952080

Pages that aren&#x27;t SPAs are far more amenable to styling changes, and are often quite readable (or even more readable) even with all author-CSS disabled.<p><i>When CSS is being generated by programs, you might as well have those programs generate inline styles - what would we lose? And we would gain in simplicity.</i><p>I see inline styles as being more of a &quot;one-off&quot; thing, while CSS selectors can affect many nodes in the tree, so I think both have their uses. The &quot;simplicity&quot; is offset by the increased memory consumption and overhead of parsing every inline style, when much of them will be the same. You could argue that pages could be compressed and maybe browsers could use methods to identify duplicate styles so they can also compress them in-memory, but why do all that (i.e. making every client, on every page reload, have to expend the resources to derive this information) when you can group together common styles under one selector for which the browser will naturally treat as one object?",1412951717

I would even say it&#x27;s the only one to be &quot;useful&quot; (is it really useful to award money to someone sometimes many years after (s)he has retired from doing any research?)<p>The Peace prize is different, by nature it is always non-consensual, because there would be no reason to award a Peace Prize if there were not someone else who is waging a war, denying other people their basic rights or doing other Bad Things. Today it&#x27;s the Taliban and the child exploiters who are the bad guys pointed out by the prize. Last year it was the Syrian dictatorship, in 2011 the Chinese government.<p>When Obama was given the Peace Prize, I was also shocked in disbelief, and like most people I think it was not deserved. But then I saw that some people in the US were not simply shacking their head, they were foaming with rage. Coincidentally, they were the same people who supported, and sometimes continued to justify the disastrous foreign policy of the previous administration. And that make me think this prize was actually well awarded. It was not deserved by Obama, and I think the Nobel committee, by giving him the prize at the beginning of his presidency before he could actually do anything for or against peace, was almost explicitly saying that they didn&#x27;t care that he didn&#x27;t deserved it. This prize was a middle finger to the Bush administration and I think that middle finger was well deserved.<p>The same goes for other polemical awards. Al Gore got it, and it made all the climate science deniers mad. Yasser Arafat got it and the Israeli political right got crazy.<p>It&#x27;s not always like this (The Red Cross got the prize a number of times, and nobody disagrees with it), but often, if you don&#x27;t understand why a Nobel Peace Prize is awarded, look at who it pisses off.",1412951121

It worked like a charm. I was pretty impressed.<p>I kind of screwed myself over though because I to do a bunch of file cleanup that I was hoping to perhaps roll back if it didn&#x27;t go well so I created a snapshot and then got to work with some copying…<p>I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and I ended up running out of space on the disk. The way ZFS snapshots work is that ZFS still does what it would normally do on a copy: writes data, then verifies the write is completed before deleting the old data. When there is a snapshot, it just skips the second step and leaves the old data around. This is how snapshots have zero performance impact on data write.<p>Turns out that I couldn&#x27;t even delete the old snapshot (or rollback the new one) because I didn&#x27;t have enough space to make <i>any</i> changes to the disk. I couldn&#x27;t even delete files because they would stay in the snapshot.<p>Aha! I can add a disk to the pool! So I added a small disk to the zpool and then I could delete the snapshot ok. However, I forgot that you can&#x27;t <i>remove</i> a disk from a zpool. I ended up having to move the data to another disk, drop the entire zpool and recreate it, and move it back.<p>Honestly, everything worked rather well except for forgetting a few of the limitations of ZFS. Given how often I have issues with HFS+ I really think it&#x27;s pretty tempting for OS X.",1412950694

If Nadella was asked <i>specifically</i> what &quot;women&quot; should do, he converted it to &quot;people&quot; in general, and his response had nothing gender-specific in it at all, and it really is a question that&#x27;s equally applicable to employees of any gender or race.<p>It&#x27;s an early gaffe from an otherwise politically-savvy CEO. Next time he&#x27;ll know not to bother with minor appearances such as these, because it&#x27;s not worth the cost.<p>EDIT: So it&#x27;s actually a very long-winded question and employees not asking for a raise <i>is the explicit subject</i> of the question. I&#x27;m transcribing it from the video that eli linked to below (thanks for the link) so that we can see the full context. I&#x27;ll transcribe the answer too.<p>----<p>Q (interviewer): So one of the questions that somebody asked was how do you-- what do you advise to women who are interested in advancing their careers but they&#x27;re not comfortable putting themselves up for promotions or advanced opportunities? And there was an interesting-- I just came from the Most Powerful Women&#x27;s Summit in Laguna Niguel, and some of the other people here also made that trip to Phoenix, and there was someone who was talking about the fact-- it was Mary Barr, who is probably someone whom you&#x27;re familiar with as well, and she was talking about the fact that she had never asked for a raise. And then her interviewer looked out at the audience, which was a lot fewer people than here, and asked &quot;How many people had never asked for a raise in their life?&quot; And I would say about a quarter to a third of the attendees raised their hands. And an interesting one was Warren Buffet-- and don&#x27;t ask me why Warren Buffet is at the most powerful women&#x27;s summit-- apparently he&#x27;s been doing it for many years. So, you know, for women who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> comfortable with asking for a raise or sort of saying-- who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> the younger you, let&#x27;s say-- what&#x27;s your advice for them?<p>A (Nadella): You know, the-- the thing that-- umm, perhaps most influenced me in terms of how you look at the journey or the career. There was this guy, whose name was Mike Naples, he was the president of Microsoft when I joined, and he had this saying where he would say, &quot;Look all sys-- all HR systems-- are long-term efficient, short-tem inefficient&quot;, and umm, I thought that that phrase just captured it, which is that it&#x27;s not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along, and that I think might be one of the additional superpowers that quite frankly women who don&#x27;t ask for a raise have, because that&#x27;s good karma! It&#x27;ll come back! Because somebody&#x27;s gonna know, &quot;That&#x27;s the kind of person that I wanna trust! That&#x27;s the kind of person that I reeeally want to give more responsibility to.&quot; And in the long-term efficiency, things catch up. And I wonder, and I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s the only approach, I wonder whether taking the long-term helps solve for what might be perceived as this uncomfortable thing of, &quot;Hey, am I getting paid right? Am I getting rewarded right?&quot;, because the reality is that your best work is not followed by your best rewards. Your best work then has impact, people recognize it, and then you get the rewards, and you have to somehow think that through I think.<p>-----<p>In context, there is some specificity to this question. The interviewer asked him what he&#x27;d say to women who are too timid to ask for raises, and he said they&#x27;re in a good position because you shouldn&#x27;t be asking for raises anyway, and then went on to elucidate very general principles about how high-quality works percolates through the organization before it results in increased long-term rewards.<p>The interviewer continues to state how she&#x27;d been hired <i>by other women</i> at 50k under market because she said &quot;just pay me whatever you want&quot;, and encourages the other attendees to learn to negotiate salary. Somehow I don&#x27;t really see how this is a gender-specific issue at all. Lowballing an employee like that would&#x27;ve been seen as a win for the female hirer, and it happens just as much <i>if not more</i> to male employees who walk in and say &quot;Please mistreat me&quot; as this interviewer did. This also has nothing to do with the question of requesting a raise when you&#x27;re already employed.",1412950619

The Unix philosophy has broken the minds of generations of programmers. It leads them to doing things like concatenating strings to build SQL queries or doing IPC with ad-hoc regex-parsed protocols or using a couple of magical characters to indicate that the contents of a variable should be parsed and executed instead of just stored. Take a read of some of the earlier threads on HN about <i>Shellshock</i>, and you will find numerous people blaming Apache for not &quot;escaping&quot; the data it was putting in a shell variable.

A problem blighting just about every non-trivial shell script ever written.<p>The usual reply is &quot;don&#x27;t use shells with untrusted data&quot;. But auditing where any particular bit of data came from can be just about impossible once it has been across several systems through programmes written in a variety of languages, stored on a file system, read back and so on. The only sane solution is to never use shell scripts.<p>Like the C memory and integer model makes writing secure C code borderline impossible, the Unix &quot;single pipe of bytes that defaults to being commands&quot; paradigm makes writing secure shell scripts borderline impossible.<p>Unix needs to be taken out back and shot.",1412949716

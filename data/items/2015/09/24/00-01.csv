The areas I collect are security (esp high assurance), fault-tolerant systems, software engineering (esp automated), systems modelling, and specific use-cases (eg databases). I have skimmed over 10,000 papers on these topics to find that most of the best work is University or a company partnered with one with occasional great work out of Microsoft, Google,etc.<p>Further, I stumbled upon the meme expressed by Perrine [1], etc that tech continuously reinvents the wheel by making same failures or re-inventing same solutions from the past. There&#x27;s a bunch of tech that hasn&#x27;t caught up to stuff from 60&#x27;s-80&#x27;s in those papers I reference. You&#x27;ll see me do my part by referencing it in places like this where it might apply. However, it reflects an overall trend that there&#x27;s tons of wisdom that&#x27;s not transferred to new tech generation and we need a Standford-style encyclopedia for it all. More likely a collection of books and Wikipedia-style articles so cross-referencing will encourage serendipity.<p>So, we could really use this.

Basically, average city streets in the US are like highways in Europe, they are wider, faster, and drivers don&#x27;t give two shits about pedestrians, cyclists or anyone else (except in Berkeley, Berkeley is like a weird parallel universe of pedestrian etiquette); a disturbingly large proportion of otherwise decent Americans get behind the wheel and turn into Mr Hyde.<p>Contrasting with London where congestion is every bit as bad, not only on the roads, but also the sidewalks, and you find a sort of emergent cooperative effort for everyone to pay attention to everyone else and attempt to make the least nuisance of themselves.  This is necessary because often the sidewalks (pavements) are overcroweded and pedestrians spill into the streets, but the cars and the bicycles watch out for this.  Similarly, cyclists will reach critical mass and sometimes block traffic, but then filter themselves down to single file to let cars go by.  Lanes are much more fluid in general, with oncoming traffic making room for buses to pass each other by utilizing part of their lane.<p>To sum it up, America lacks an attitude of public cooperation when it comes to transportation infrastructure and utilization.

10269227,comment,10264766,10269122,0,0,derefr,,,"> and it actually has nothing to do with hypervisors, unless you take the metaphor that any operating system you install is really running under the control and whim of the Intel Management Engine<p>What I meant was that, the same way the userland runs at the control and whim of the kernel, and the kernel at the control and whim of the hypervisor, the hypervisor itself will run at the control and whim of IME. Because IME sits at ring -2 (yes, that&#x27;s a thing now), the hypervisor at ring -1, the kernel at ring 0, and userland at ring 3. So it&#x27;s actually <i>more than</i> &quot;hypervisor-level access&quot;, but a hypervisor is <i>almost</i> as capable, so it&#x27;s a decent comparison.<p>> ...except it could be used to deliver similar functionality...<p>That&#x27;s what I was trying to communicate, yes. The <i>purpose</i> (not the functionality) of IME is to enable enterprise management. Like Group Policy or Configuration Profiles, like server backplane management, like running your app as a VM on a hypervisor, like a lot of things.<p>The point is that <i>these technologies exist to enable companies to control and manage their hardware assets.</i> None of them are built in such a way that they can reach out and bite you if they haven&#x27;t been set up and configured <i>by the computer&#x27;s owner</i>, any more than someone could interface with your computer&#x27;s serial console without attaching a serial cable to it.<p>A lot of devices come with privileged backdoors, for a variety of reasons. For example, a lot of CPUs have a JTAG debugger chip embedded, exposed via GPIOs. But since such backdoors <i>require hardware access to enable</i>, they&#x27;re not all that scary. Of course your device isn&#x27;t secure if someone gains physical access to it. While they were in there, they might have also installed a Bluetooth-transmitting in-line keylogger chip or something.<p>Now, what might be scary about IME is that it&#x27;s enabled by default. But a lot of things are also insecure by default until hardening is applied, and have to be secured in a clean-room environment: Windows, for example. If you care, you do this.<p>But I don&#x27;t see its existence <i>in particular</i> as troubling, insofar as it doesn&#x27;t represent any greater loss of control than was already true. Intel chips (and I&#x27;m pretty sure those of most other CISC manufacturers) have been running microcode updated via encrypted blobs for decades; this microcode can have any number of backdoors embedded in it. You don&#x27;t need a fancy special-purpose coprocessor to do this stuff; the main processor is perfectly capable of doing Intel&#x27;s bidding instead of yours without any help. The IME just allows your computer to do the bidding of <i>some arbitrary third-party that Intel likes</i> (like DRM companies), instead of the code needing to be written by Intel themselves, embedded deep in the CPU&#x27;s internals.<p>Note also that <i>most</i> firmware chips can be re-flashed to do bad things; CPUs are not alone in presenting this &quot;bugged out-of-the-box&quot; attack-vector.<p>...but then, to go one step further: if you don&#x27;t trust Intel&#x27;s chips because of their <i>firmware</i>, why does it matter whether it&#x27;s firmware or not? Backdoors can be embedded in the traces of the CPU itself. Having updatable microcode doesn&#x27;t change this; the existence of the IME doesn&#x27;t change this. Do you think the NSA can&#x27;t requisition a one-off custom variant printing of a CPU, and get that stuck the board of a Person of Interest&#x27;s laptop, or phone, or TV, instead?<p>This is why I was concentrating on the Intel AMT (remote Internet access) feature of the IME: it&#x27;s the only part that materially changes things from how-the-world-was before its existence. If you&#x27;re an end-user and own your computer, you can disable AMT, and verify that it&#x27;s disabled—the computer will no longer reply to probes on that port. Everything else is just a dozen new vectors for motivated attackers to do things motivated attackers have always been able to do.",1443055588
10269226,comment,10264513,10268945,0,0,teraflop,,,"I think you&#x27;ve pretty much got it, but what makes it work is that you&#x27;re overprovisioned at <i>each</i> level. You don&#x27;t have to set up an addressing scheme that&#x27;s guaranteed to be able to satisfy every conceivable request as a contiguous range. The extra buffer means that if you run out at one level, you can get another allocation from the next level up without having to advertise it globally.<p>Right now, if you need more IPv4 addresses, you have to buy a /22 or so from someone else. Because the address space is so hotly-contested, that block could come from almost anywhere, which means <i>every core router on the internet</i> needs to remember where it lives on the actual topology.<p>With IPv6, maybe once in a while a customer comes along who needs more than a /56. No big deal; you just give them another (maybe non-contiguous, if you&#x27;re unlucky) allocation from the ISP&#x27;s block. The ISP needs to remember that both allocations belong to the same customer, and route packets accordingly. But everyone else can just route based on the ISP&#x27;s all-encompassing prefix.

Doyle and colleagues reported that among women on low incomes low birth weight was significantly associated with poor intakes of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, zinc and iron, all of which (together with other nutrients such as folate and vitamin B- 12) liver provides in generous amounts at low cost. Fetal nutritional insufficiency, low birth weight, and the associated risk of defects is thus likely to be a far greater problem on a population basis than the risk of defect associated with vitamin A toxicity.<p>> Most women do not need to take vitamin A supplements either before or during pregnancy, and those who do should be under medical supervision. There is justifiable concern about the excessive concentrations of vitamin A in liver, but it is equally important to remember that liver is a source of many nutrients and a desirable adjunct to the diets of many women, particularly those on low incomes. [1]<p>As for Mr Greger, I&#x27;ve checked out his work following your recommendation. His section about antioxidants doesn&#x27;t instill confidence. The claims about wonder properties of antioxidants (preventing cancer being the primary one) are oft-repeated across the site, but this optimism should be more reserved:<p>> Randomized, placebo-controlled trials—which, when performed well, provide the strongest evidence—offer little support that taking vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, or other single antioxidants provides substantial protection against heart disease, cancer, or other chronic conditions. The results of the largest such trials have been mostly negative. [2]<p>The videos on Mr Greger site quote only one paper about the preventive effects of antioxidants. The other studies which don&#x27;t support this premise are omitted.<p>Since antioxidant industry is significant ($65 billion in 2012 in the US alone [3]), this is not only a nice-sounding rhetoric, but a clever marketing as well.<p>At first I thought such sloppy reporting was only limited to one topic on this site. But there might be more. For example, the link between milk and autism [4] is also not as clear as it&#x27;s being made on the website:<p>> In autism spectrum disorders, many parents resort to alternative treatments and these are generally perceived as risk free. Among these, the most commonly used is the gluten-free, casein-free diet. The objective of this work was to conduct a systematic review of studies published from 1970 to date related to the gluten-free, casein-free diet in autism spectrum disorder patients. Few studies can be regarded as providing sound scientific evidence since they were blinded randomized controlled trials, and even these were based on small sample sizes, reducing their validity.

If that&#x27;s true, then <i>ipso facto</i> changes in CEO compensation cannot account for most of the structural increase in inequality over the last half century.<p>A more likely suspect is the influence of technology, which has interlinked global markets so that the dominant players are able to extract significantly more value than in the past. Outsourcing has suppressed wages while increasing profitability, which naturally contributes to inequality. And in an interconnected global trading system, economies of scale become more and more beneficial, which consolidates resources among the top competitors in a given field.<p>One interesting question is how the sharing economy will affect this phenomenon in the future. Will the creation of &#x27;Ubers for everything&#x27; drive down wages even further by saturating labor markets with even more surplus human capital? Will it destabilize some of the entrenched social hierarchies in America by gutting the fortunes that legacy industries currently enjoy?<p>Another issue worth serious thought is which kinds of inequality are most harmful to society and why. Is stratification of the middle class and the hyper-rich the primary dilemma, simply because it accounts for the greatest resource disparity on paper? Or in practice is America&#x27;s social cohesion damaged more by the smaller gaps between members of the other social classes?<p>Finally, how should concerns about inequality influence America&#x27;s immigration policy? If we view the current situation as a problem, then importing more low-skilled laborers will exacerbate things. It&#x27;s hardly a coincidence that the super-rich are some of the strongest advocates of comprehensive immigration reform.

For ease of reference, the EPA is called this the &quot;switch&quot;. The &quot;switch&quot; senses whether the vehicle is being tested or not based on various inputs including the position of the steering wheel, vehicle speed, the duration of the engine&#x27;s operation, and barometric pressure. These inputs precisely track the parameters of the federal test procedure used for emission testing for EPA certification purposes. During EPA emission testing, the vehicles&#x27; ECM ran software which produced compliant emission results under an ECM calibration that VW referred to as the &quot;dyno calibration&quot; (referring to the equipment used in emissions tested, called a dynamometer). At all other times during normal vehicle operation, the &quot;switch&quot; was activated and the vehicle ECM software ran a separate &quot;road calibration&quot; which reduced the effectiveness of the emission control system (specifically the selective catalytic reduction or the lean NOx trap). As a result, emissions of NOx increased by a factor of 10 to 40 times above the EPA complian levels, depending on the type of drive cycles (e.g., city, highway).<p>--- end quote ---<p>And here is what happened when this was found out and the EPA and CARB tried to find out what was happening:<p>--- begin quote ---<p>VW continued to assert to CARB and the EPA that the increased emissions from these vehicles could be attributed to various technical issues and unexpected in-use conditions. VW issued a voluntary recall in December 2014 to address the issue. CARB, in coordination with the EPA, conducted follow up testing of those vehicles both in the laboratory and during normal road operation to confirm the efficacy of the recall. When the teting showed only a limited benefit to the recall, CARB broadened the testing to pinpoint the exact technical nature of the vehicles&#x27; poor performance, and to investigate why the vehicles&#x27; onboard diagnostic system was not detecting the increase emissions. None of the potential technical issues suggested by VW explained the higher test results consistently confirmed during CARB&#x27;s testing. It became clear that CARB and the EPA would not approve certificates of conformity for VW&#x27;s 2016 model year diesel vehicles until VW could adequately explain the anomalous emissions and ensure the agencies that the 2016 model year vehicles would not have similar issues. Only then did VW admit it had designed and installed a defeat device in these vehicles in the form of a sophisticated software algorithm that detected when a vehicle was undergoing emissions testing.<p>--- end quote ---",1443055188

10269197,comment,10268286,10268286,0,0,bane,,,"I disagree with this. The U.S. military has no single conventional opponent that can reasonably oppose it, anywhere in the world. Keep in mind this article is coming out after the U.S. simultaneously engaged in two decade-long wars <i>simultaneously</i> while still maintaining continuous presence in Asia, Europe and with hardly a blip on the economic radar in the U.S. During WW2, the U.S. shifted virtually the entire economy to a war footing, and outproduced land, sea and air vehicles and munitions of several other combined nations. The U.S. spends a remarkably small fraction of GDP on war goods at present, but history shows that when it gears up in one direction, it can rapidly turn into a highly militaristic society.<p>In fact, the U.S. military is optimized for external operations and force projection, home turf is not the kind of advantage it was throughout history. There is no tactical position on the planet that a conventional military can assume that the U.S. cannot effectively target. Americans have absolute dominion of the skies, with a multi-phased air force that can erode even highly fortified air defense systems. American missiles can be launched from ships, submarines, mobile launchers and so on and can strike, soften or destroy armored stationary armored targets. American armor is so advanced, and numerous, that it can fight in the middle of a chem-bio weapons attack, while on the move, take multiple armor piercing rounds, and still fight. American foot soldiers are heavily armed <i>and</i> armored. They&#x27;re among the best trained in tactical fighting, and can fight in open battles to urban landscapes equally well.<p>In unit on unit fights, the American military almost always absolutely dominates. The Officer corps is trained at some of the finest military schools in the world, with lessons on logistics, strategy and tactics that span lessons learned from thousands of years of history. The schools are so good, the other countries send their officers there for training. Americans are pragmatic fighters, without doctrine of fighting to the last man or always pushing ahead. It doesn&#x27;t waste time training for tough-man parlor tricks. There&#x27;s minimal shame in retreating because it just means you can fight again tomorrow.<p>On the flip side, the U.S., despite having huge borders, is a virtual fortress. Two huge oceans means any non-American invader needs to project massive military power around half the planet, something no other country can do. Once here, the U.S. is packed full of military bases with something like more than a million active duty soldiers, most of which are veterans of overseas campaigns -- the U.S. has almost been continuously at war since its founding. There&#x27;s around another 800,000 reservists. Something like between 30-40% of all Americans have been in the military at one time or another. Beyond that, there&#x27;s another 70million fit for duty and there are as many guns in America as there are people. This is a military of volunteers, people <i>chose</i> to join.<p>The problem is that conventional wars aren&#x27;t what&#x27;s likely to happen. The U.S. maintains a massive conventional force, but also has decades of practice fighting unconventional wars against guerrilla-style tactics. It&#x27;s not optimized for it, so it doesn&#x27;t do it very well, but it&#x27;s further along that route than virtually anybody else -- for example, American air power now has a non-trivial percentage of unmanned, long-dwell, drones, that are increasingly armed and capable. The need to fight against conventional air forces is dwindling.<p>Going forward, the U.S. is going towards unmanned drones, either autonomous or piloted from thousands of miles away, exoskeleton and armored enhanced ground troops, autonomous tactical walking ground units, auto-aiming and firing weapons, enhanced mesh sensor networks, directed energy weapons, rail guns, higher precision munitions, hyper-spectral computer vision enhanced vision systems, live tactical coordinating AI, advanced 3d models of entire countries down to cm-level precision, simulation systems that can predict everything from enemy sniper locations to how many GPS satellites you&#x27;re nav system will be able to see from this position in a city, blocked by these buildings, 12 hours into the future.<p>The U.S. is conceivably 3-5 generations ahead of everybody else on the planet in terms of technology and techniques and is on a path of bringing to bear this future technology without having to put a single American on foreign soil. Even U.S.-level advanced militaries like Britain and Australia are no longer able to keep up. Hyper-advanced economies like South Korea license 2-generation older fighter planes, which are outfitted with lesser avionics and radar systems.<p>The U.S. still struggles against asymmetric tactics, but its catching up fast. SOF units are developing tactics and are training specifically to counter asymmetric enemies. A combination of intelligence and precision strikes, theories of human organization and communications, anti-enemy-logistics, anti-improvised, anti-etc. If the U.S. can cover conventional and asymmetric warfare reasonably well, there&#x27;s no force on the planet that can withstand it, not conceivably in the next few generations.<p>The rise of other powers is more likely to bring Americans out of the complacency of the 90s, and reinvigorate military development and maintenance, not threaten it.",1443055087

You might even find that what you&#x27;re trying to create is a mashup, or &quot;stack&quot;, of two or three different monadic things that have already been defined. You&#x27;d know that because your new jQuery structure obeys a couple simple rules that it is well-behaved and reasonable in the presence of those functions (and others that don&#x27;t exist yet), and you may even notice some optimizations you can confidently make.",1443054449

This is the dark ages of open-source UI<p>I think it&#x27;s important to be aware that on this front the Open Source movement has completely stalled.

But it is fundamentally at odds with Open Source software. Back in the day of desktop software, you could throw a tarball on the web and people could use your stuff without any real handholding. In order for people to use a web service you write, you have to maintain a server instance. It&#x27;s just not worth it for me, random open source web service author, to maintain a server for millions of you, random open source software users. It&#x27;s time and it&#x27;s money for very little direct benefit to me.<p>And on app stores, it&#x27;s pretty bad too. Maintaining a reviewed and updated app in an app store is a huge job, and not something a casual contributor to an open source GUI is going to want to do, just to have access to their branch of an app. And I&#x27;m not even sure Apple will let you submit an identical app with just one little feature changed.<p>This will change... the endgame is something like Ethereum, and the currentgame is maybe something like Heroku Button, but there is still a lot of infrastructure to build to make it as easy to maintain an open source web app as it is to maintain a desktop app.<p>And in the meantime, Open Source UI is just going to languish a bit.

They are separate experiences for me. I find it a little much when people talk about how much better paper books are over ebook simply because they can browse around a Powell&#x27;s for hours until they smell just the right type of leather bindings. I mean that&#x27;s fine and all, I enjoy that stuff too, but my Kindle allows me to actually <i>read</i> more things, while being so much more convenient to tote around. I don&#x27;t really need to visit a book store to get a sense of the next Brandon Sanderson novel. I already know I&#x27;m going to buy that, so a Kindle makes much more sense to me there. I enjoy a trip to the book store on a lazy Sunday, where I&#x27;d like to find a new trade paperback comic or even a photography collection. Book stores don&#x27;t make paper better or worse though, they are just a great experience on their own. /rant",1443053463

There&#x27;s little question as to why companies install open source software - the TCO can be lower.  But why do people contribute their time in building it?<p>The answer is that the reward of being part of an OSS team brings great utility to a developer, and this is true even for marginally successful OSS projects.  So people exchange their time for intangibles like reputation, credibility markers ( the author casually drops in which projects he is involved in) as well as the ability to leverage involvement into actual cash like well paid consultant gigs, books or successful blogs.<p>So there isn&#x27;t any strangeness going on at all.

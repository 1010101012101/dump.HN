Shannon's theorem lets you know what kind of parameters make that possible -- namely, bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio.  From there, I can make an informed decision about the entire signal chain.  Once I choose the bandwidth, the theorem tells me the SNR so I can assign a noise budget to each of the components.  If we assume that the noise is Gaussian, we can calculate total noise level as the root sum of squares of the noise levels of the individual components (don't forget to multiply by the gain).  I can look at an amplifier IC's spec sheet and immediately say, ""that's too noisy"" or ""that's overdesigned, I think I can get something cheaper"".<p>And thanks to theorems we got from the field of real analysis and statistics, we know that the sum of Gaussians is itself Gaussian.  So rather than sticking two components together and measuring the noise, or running a computer simulation, I can simply square, sum, and square root.<p>Each of these theorems reduces the amount of work necessary -- whether by pen and paper or by computer -- by an enormous factor.  But if you can describe in similar detail how the computer program would work, I'll acknowledge your greatness.",1349844517

In this area, the system would present to the user a phrase which the user selected when setting up their account.<p>This would prevent phishing, as users would be trained to look for the phrase (and / or icon ... the reason you can't have an icon alone is because the phisher could get it right 1 out of N times).<p>Now, on the web there is a similar thing you can do! When someone places KEYBOARD FOCUS in your password box, and starts typing the correct password, you display the icon + phrase that you previously selected when setting up your account. If the phrase doesn't pop up or is different, you know you're being phished.<p>THIS is a great way to stop phishing on the web. Anyone impersonating you will not know what phrase to display. Only by starting to type the correct pass phrase will they get this information. On the other hand, they won't be able to place anything fake over the password input box and capture your input, because the phrase only appears when you type IN the password input box, which the attacker can't get to, thanks to the cross-domain security in browsers!",1349842928

This is all fine-people are now able to print off a few photos, documents, flyers to post around and more.

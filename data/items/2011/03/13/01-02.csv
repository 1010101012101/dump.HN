But yeah it is offensive, when the dust hasn't settled and people are trapped in buildings, to try and cash in on the ""opportunity"" with a message that said, in effect, ""Hey everyone look how we're generous we are and if you spread the message about how generous Microsoft is (by retweeting this message) we'll donate an entire dollar (up to the level of the salary of a low level flunky at our company).""<p>I think if Bill was still running things, he'd have a) made a bigger donation and b) wouldn't come across as trying to exploit the situation.<p>It's perfectly fine for a company to seek recognition for it's contribution to the public good, but if it's not handled well, it can come across as a crass and cynical exploitation. If they had just tweeted ""Hey Microsoft is donating $100,000 to Japan relief, here's how you can do the same http:\\bit.ly\xxxx"" they may have gotten more retweets, and certainly a lot more respect.",1299981487

2318063,comment,2314672,2314672,0,0,kstenerud,,,"Personally, I love sites like SO and Quora. When I'm digging into something outside of my experience/expertise (which is almost daily in my current job), I'm consistently landing on pages that have answers written to my questions. That's great.<p>What's NOT great, is having some esoteric need, landing on a bunch of pages, and finding that most of them have an ""are you sure you want to do this?"" response with no effort made to answer the question, ahm, in question.<p>The author is right in this respect. You are NOT just answering the person who asked the question. Stuff on the internet STAYS. For YEARS. That means that you're answering EVERYONE who EVER asks that question, and chances are that a lot of them DO know what they are doing. All they lack are the mechanical steps to take, which you have denied them by your second guessing of intentions. And that is MASSIVELY frustrating. Sites like Quora understand this, thus the ""not helpful"" button.<p>If you must question the judgment of the person asking, do so AFTER answering the question. Otherwise your answer is, in fact, NOT useful. Oh, it may be useful if you've successfully guessed the intentions of the asker, but for a great number of other people who will land on that page in the years to come it is nothing more than condescension.<p>I participate because I find it a godsend whenever I get stuck on some esoteric API or poorly documented technology, or I just want to use something in a way that it's not actually meant to be used BECAUSE I HAVE A DAMN GOOD REASON TO DO IT. And I want to extend the same courtesy of answering without prejudice so that some other soul can be similarly helped by my answer.",1299981437

That's not how it works in practice.  Investors who fund a startup using convertible debt are not hoping the debt will be repaid, like a regular lender is; they want it to convert to equity.  So in practice if there's no equity round by the end of the term, the debt either gets converted or the term gets extended.<p>It's not like convertible debt was invented in 2010.  I've seen many startups hit the end of the term of a convertible note before raising an equity round, and it has never once been a problem.",1299980820

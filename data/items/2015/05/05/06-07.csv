I feel as though we are going to see Microsoft one day implement a strategy that could go two different ways:<p>1) They end up giving away Windows for free (which they kind of announced with Windows 10). Windows 10 will be a free upgrade to everyone, including pirated users of Windows 8.<p>2) Windows moves to a subscription based model like Adobe&#x27;s Creative Cloud. Instead of paying for a copy that you own forever, Microsoft allow you to create an account and sign up for a Windows account for X amount of time. Similar again to Adobe the cost depends on whether you commit to a full year or not.<p>There are definitely some interesting things happening at Microsoft, some that 10 years ago people would have laughed at you if you predicted them.

One is nature. One is nurture. Every single activity in life will require both components to come together.

That their life somehow has greater meaning. This is the myth that needs to be debunked. Being a 10x programmer does not make you a better person. In ANY way, what-so-ever.

For graduate school you may need to pass some broad exam, but afterwards in turning towards research you also want to be much more picky about what you choose to learn and stick to learning mainly (but not necessarily exclusively) things that are likely to help your particular goals.<p>You should think of learning as of investing and learn things that you are likely to have some use for in the future or ones that you simply like learning.

9491169,comment,9486548,9486548,0,0,kagamine,,,"Let&#x27;s all remember that UX (& IxD!) should be based on research and testing, not on assumed patterns.<p>The statement that &quot;Make your website more scannable by using less text and adding more imagery (as humans are 90% visual creatures)&quot; sounds as much like dumbing-down as anything I have ever heard, resulting in useless pages that I don&#x27;t need. In fact at <a href=""http://uxmyths.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uxmyths.com/</a> myths 4, 7 & 8 counter this idea of more visual being better. The mantra I like more is &quot;content is king&quot;. Think man pages. Although a specific use case, man pages benefit from concise, precise information, and pictures would be a detriment. Same goes for most news articles.<p>Similarly with error messages, the article uses specific errors to make a case and then uses Skype&#x27;s login to illustrate the &quot;right way&quot;. These are two very different use-case shapes being forced into a square hole.  As many of us here should know, there is nothing worse than a fuzzy, warm error message that can&#x27;t be searched online or in documentation. Sure, errors should not be &quot;error: 0x15654213!&quot; but should include enough information for the user to <i>solve the problem</i> (and please do not use exclamation marks in errors!). Often, some technical info, even if just an error code and a short description are enough to resolve the issue. If you can&#x27;t log in, as in the Skype example, well, it&#x27;s one of two things 99% of the time. You probably don&#x27;t need to google that.<p>I like the rest of what the author has to say, especially that part about developers getting to do it over and over while UX is expected to be right first time (assuming the place you work actually does UX, mine doesn&#x27;t and the results vary greatly).

9491167,comment,9490572,9491130,0,0,ongardie,,,"This question came up at the CoreOS Fest earlier today too. I think everyone wants libraries as well as services, and I&#x27;d like that too for LogCabin one day. It&#x27;s just a bit harder when you start thinking about the details. It&#x27;s not impossible though. As one example, CockroachDB is using etcd&#x27;s Raft implementation as a library.<p>Part of the issue is that we want to have libraries with small simple interfaces, and a consensus library is probably going to be on the large side, as it has to interface with the disk, the network, and the state machine, plus membership changes, log compaction, who&#x27;s the leader, configuration settings, debug logging, etc.<p>Another issue is that, as a library, it has to be in the language you&#x27;re using. And if that language is C++ or similar, it has to be compatible/convenient with whatever threading approach you&#x27;re using.<p>Then there&#x27;s performance/memory. Some Raft implementations are designed to keep relatively small amounts of data in memory (like LogCabin or etcd), and others are meant to store large amounts on disk (like HydraBase). Some are optimized more for performance, others for safety.<p>I think we&#x27;ll get libraries eventually. Keep in mind Raft is still very young. Paxos is around 26 years old, Raft is only .5 to 3 years old (depending on when you start counting). I like to think that Raft lowered the cost of developing a consensus system/library significantly, but it still takes time to develop mature implementations. Right now we have a lot of implementations in early stages; I wonder if some of these efforts will consolidate over time into really flexible libraries.",1430808515

9491165,comment,9490934,9490934,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"One question I have had since I first heard about the TPP is: why the secrecy? The TPP is meant to be a trade agreement for multiple nations, if the end goal is to make it easy to do business with other countries, why are the details so scarce, why is nobody allowed to know of its contents? We are talking about an agreement a lot of members of congress do not know anything about, but representatives from companies like General Electric do.<p>We should be legitimately scared of how the TPP is being handled, how its terms are being negotiated and the stasian like control that Obama and the administration seems to have over who can view the agreement in progress as well as informing the public of its contents. The reason is obvious: if the public were to know what the terms of the TPP were, they would be outraged (and rightfully so). If a bill has the power to increase the cost of medicines, enforce broken patent system protections, change copyright laws and restrict your freedoms in the real world and online, don&#x27;t the public have a right to know?<p>How are those who are even given the opportunity to view the bill (in limited circumstance) able to back the bill and make a decision on supporting it when the government is not letting anyone take a copy back and closely inspect its contents deeper? Could it be the Obama administration and the backers of the bill do not want anyone to see what it truly contains? Limiting how people view it and when is a great way to hide the corporately sponsored additions that are littered throughout the bill.<p>What we have here is nothing more than a corporate power grab. You know something is fundamentally broken when we have to rely on a site like WikiLeak&#x27;s to keep the public updated as to what changes have been made to a monumentally massive trade agreement.<p>I hope this bill is killed or as a decent compromise, has the secrecy veil lifted and the real negotiations can be done in public in a more democratic and less North Korean style manner.",1430808432

It&#x27;s what drove me to spend some time working for an Indian MNC in Mumbai.<p>We were trying to sell internally to what is known as &quot;bottom of the pyramid&quot; markets - the large proportion of the population that makes about $100/month. These live 5-10 to a room, and something like a fridge is a massive improvement in quality of life as being able to store food means one less day a week trekking to the market and one more day to do some work (oddly enough, they still buy a TV first).<p>Turns out being local is not much help. White goods? The Koreans have more efficient factories and more innovative design. Next time you&#x27;re in the countryside, check out how much of the store they occupy. FMCG (including your soap)?

A few thoughts:<p>Byzantine is more complex, and most people in industry aren&#x27;t doing it: there are a lot of Byzantine papers out there but few real-world implementations. I think Byzantine is important for uses where the nodes really can&#x27;t be trusted for security reasons, and maybe there&#x27;s easier fault-tolerance payoffs elsewhere when the entire system is within one trust domain such as a single company.<p>Byzantine consensus is slower and requires more servers.<p>If you don&#x27;t have independent implementations running on each of your servers, the same software bug could still take out your entire cluster. You get some benefit if the hardware fails independently, but you don&#x27;t get protection from correlated software outages. Maybe the difficulty in characterizing which faults a particular deployment can handle makes it harder to sell to management.<p>With Raft, we were just trying to solve non-Byzantine consensus in a way people could understand, and we think it&#x27;s still a useful thing to study even if your ultimate goal is Byzantine consensus.

Such a library can be used as a starting point for building other more complex systems which aim to provide a low-friction install experience. For example, one good thing about both Cassandra and ElasticSearch is that they both have homogeneous clusters where all nodes play the same role. Incidentally, from what I understand, they both embed a consensus implementation within.<p>Similarly, a membership service (and failure detector) over gossip protocols will also be very useful.<p>An installation guide which starts with &quot;First, install Zookeeper cluster. Then, install a SWARM cluster. Then ...&quot; is not very appealing. That being the case, I wonder <i>why</i> there is no mature OSS library which provides these services.

After I got it I used it all the time around the house, and sometimes on the road (using the mobile hotspot on my Droid Charge) when I didn&#x27;t mind carrying around an extra device.<p>Then I got a Galaxy Note 2. The day I got it was literally the last time I used the Nexus 7. It did everything the Nexus 7 could do and it was always with me. It had almost the same display resolution in a much smaller overall package thanks to the slimmer bezel.<p>It was bigger than the Droid Charge, but it actually fit <i>better</i> in my pants pocket. My carrying system for years has been to put the phone (with no case) in my left front pants pocket with the screen facing in to protect it. Keys and change go in the right front pocket so they never scratch the phone. Don&#x27;t need cargo pants for this, just regular slacks or shorts.<p>This worked OK for the Droid Charge, but the phone always ended up sideways in my pocket. When I sat down, the Droid would stick out because it was crosswise with the long end against the curve of my leg. The Note 2 was big enough that it wouldn&#x27;t tip on its side in the pocket like that; it stayed upright with the long end parallel to my leg and the short end going across. So despite being a bigger phone, it ended up being less in the way.<p>Later upgraded to a Note 3 and Note 4, and wouldn&#x27;t go back to a smaller phone at all.<p>I do pay attention to pocket depth when I buy pants, but most of the styles I like have reasonably deep pockets anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t talk on the phone much, and when I do the larger size isn&#x27;t a problem.

9491074,comment,9488170,9489544,0,0,ende,,,"Maybe.  Undergraduate biology typically sticks to the same set of model systems (Krebs Cycle, for example) even across different courses (microbiology, biochemistry, etc.) in order to reveal deeper levels of complexity within some focused context.  You never really get all the edge cases at once though.<p>I think what most biology undergraduate programs need to add - and many have - is the equivalent of a &quot;Programming Languages&quot; course which adds a &#x27;state of the diversity of the field&#x27; dimension to the usual micro-/macro- dimensions.  CS (speaking very generally here) tends to either drill down into low level computation or up into high level abstraction, and Bio tends to drill down into sub-cellular/molecular or up into social/behavioral/evolutionary.  In CS, a course in programming languages tends to offer a nice survey of the diverse extents of the field, and a similar survey of all of life&#x27;s vast biodiversity would be a welcome addition to the undergraduate curriculum, imho.",1430805657

5360623,comment,5359458,5360593,1,0,smsm42,,,"<i>Or maybe the owner of the company will just buy more automation for the money he saved that will cause further savings?</i><p>Maybe. That would then create job for automation creators - and for somebody to mow the lawn of automation creator because he's now too busy to mow it himself, creating the automation. The point is - more productivity creates value, not destroys it. Even though the value created may be allocated differently - so if $100 of value were created, it may end up (grossly simplifying, of course) that somebody would have $150 and somebody -$50. If you think in human terms, getting -$50 sucks, and I can totally understand that and there may be talk how to help that particular unfortunate man to deal with it, of course. But if you switch to economics terms, it's still +$100.<p>It's the reverse of the famous Broken Window Fallacy. If the world worked like the author of the main post thinks it does, you could create wealth just by breaking and destroying things - which ""creates jobs"" both for breakers and for somebody who would the restore them. I think it is obvious that no value is created this way.",1363071478

Even in studies of those who were considered sensitive to sugar, children did not behave differently after eating sugar full or sugar-free diets.3<p>> Scientists have even studied how parents react to the sugar myth.

5360601,comment,5354810,5358694,1,0,dalke,,,"""Moderation in all things"", says Aristotle.<p>You've offered a different set of guidelines than the previous poster, but some of the same questions remain. What's ""old"" and what's ""new""? Is corn new or old? What about almonds, which are toxic in the wild species, or taro which is toxic until processed? What about wheat?<p>Wild apples are not that edible. They are too astringent; crabapples. It's only through grafting of the very occasional tree with edible fruit that we get new edible cultivars. The Gala apple has only been around since the 1970s. Does that make it new? (Interesting story: Johnny Appleseed brought apple trees to the western frontier for making hard cider and apple jack, and not for eating. They were grown from seed, and only grafting preserves the taste.)<p>Domesticated sugarcane is older than most other plants we currently use. Should we prioritize sugarcane, because it's older? Or is it only foods species unchanged since 10,000 years ago that we should prioritize?<p>If you, like I, haven't inherited genetics from the indigenous peoples of the Americas, then your personal genetics have had less than 500 years to evolve for pineapple, corn, tomatoes, and other New World plants. Should we avoid New World plants and only eat things found in East Africa?<p>500 years ago isn't that long. That's almost exactly the same time that the Reinheitsgebot (German beer purity law) has been in place. How long does it take for a new food to become old? Your genetics have certainly not adapted to eat macadamia nuts from Australia, because they've been a crop for less than 200 years, and only Australian aborigines would have had any adaptations for them. Does that make those new or old to our genome?<p>Commercial production of macadamia nuts is about as old as Jack Daniel's. Should they have equal prioritization?<p>Believe it or not, but beer making is at least 7,000 years old. You can't say ""Drinking it on a regular basis is about as stupid as eating arsenic or lead salts for kicks"" because for it has been a daily drink for several thousand years. During the Babylonian era, ""a daily ration of beer was provided for all citizens, the amount depending on one's social status"" and ""it was sometimes used to pay workers as part of their daily wages."" During the Middle Ages it was safer to drink than water.<p>In fact, we've evolved in order to process alcohol better: ""The studies on human ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) gene have suggested Darwinian positive selection on the genetic variation of ADH1B His47 [5254]. Alcohol consumption is a recent agriculture-related life style, and the adaptive selection has begun about 10Kya""  <a href=""http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijeb/2011/484769/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijeb/2011/484769/</a><p>Even if you think that the genetics of the paleo era outweigh the genetics of the last 10,000 years, our monkey/ape guts tell us that we did not evolve with the expectation of eating ""a relatively modest hunk of meat"" for most of our meals.<p>This tells me that you don't know the history of our food and your adjusting things up to fit your personal beliefs. Your last sentence is equally odd - my European genetic ancestry definitely co-evolved with animal husbandry to make it so I can drink cow's milk as an adult. You reject that genetic heritage because you're squeamish?<p>That's all fine as a personal or moral belief, but it doesn't make good sense as a general ""mandatory"" consideration.",1363070750

Eg, ""The studies on human ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) gene have suggested Darwinian positive selection on the genetic variation of ADH1B His47 [5254].

I worked first in the film industry at Panavision with some of the top camera crews in the world because my boss (1) at the time believed in me. After that I decided software was a better future and a friend of mine (2) wanted me to work at the company he worked for...a digital agency. With no resume or cover level I got a job because my current boss (3) two years later believed in me. Now I'm here on HN, have a youtube channel teaching others, and just wrapped up an eight  month enterprise website with a great team...and I'm going to buy a sports car this weekend! How big hearts in some people can make such a big difference in someone's life...forever grateful!",1363068420

I'm not myself ethnically Danish, so I'm not sure it's purely ethnicity, but it's... something (and ethnicity probably does play a role in encouraging cohesion, if not the sole one).<p>Even in extreme cases, there's this general feeling of: yeah, so that person is an irresponsible alcoholic, but he's <i>your</i> irresponsible alcoholic, so you can't exactly let him die in the street. You've got to give him some basic shelter/food. I've run into that in other countries also, but only from closely related people: southern Europeans are very family-oriented, so if someone <i>in their family</i> is in danger of being a homeless alcoholic, they'll find a room for the person to sleep in, etc., since it's considered the family's responsibility to do something about them. Denmark doesn't emphasize family ties as much, though. Instead things tend to be done on a wider scale: it's sort of everyone's responsibility to take care of the proverbial crazy old uncle, rather than laying the responsibility on the handful of people who happen to be his nephews/nieces through accident of birth.",1363068031

It's easy to do what you think is right (at least when it comes to spending money that you have), but what's the use of it if others keep behaving in the ways you consider wrong? The whole point of it is to control other people so that they would behave right too! And if you don't have to persuade them but actually can force them to comply using the threat of violence - even better!

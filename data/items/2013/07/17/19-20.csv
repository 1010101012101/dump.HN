6059902,comment,6058567,6059191,2,0,megrimlock,,,"Patrick has put his finger on this concern before, and (I feel) persuasively reframed things to resonate with an engineering mindset:<p><pre><code>  http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve tried to use this same reframing approach when working with people to estimate a software schedule (for complex projects with external promises).  Basically, if you can establish that engineering is about tradeoffs -- such as between runtime and memory footprint and code size and small vs large values of N and so on -- then certainly human development time is another resource subject to tradeoffs, where we should identify alternate scenarios and try to aim for the optimal one.<p>Finding ways to talk to people in terms that resonate is tricky -- and often almost a matter of bridging micro-cultures, where subtle tribal affinity signals are needed to gain trust -- so I was impressed that Patrick could break down salary negotiation in a way that didn&#x27;t seem skeezy to people who just want to build great things and not worry they are getting shafted.",1374091194

Once all the facts about the NSA have come out, I think the public will be against what the NSA is doing. Bush&#x27;s torture program divided the country more, and I suspect it&#x27;s largely because 9/11 isn&#x27;t as fresh on our minds now.<p>Truthfully, I think that the torture programs are to Prism as the McCarthy Committee is to the Vietnam War.",1374091180

I&#x27;m sick and tired of this bullshit that higher education has been ramming down our collective throats courtesy of a system in which easily available, seemingly infinite credit on the part of the students allows colleges to continuously seek out new revenue by burdening students with ever increasing debt.<p>Its funny to me that state schools, including Berkeley, used to have reasonable tuition up until the early 1980&#x27;s, until the baby boomer voters in each respective state demanded lower taxes and the politicians obliged by cutting state tuition assistance year after year.  When the state paid 90% of a student&#x27;s tuition, the colleges didn&#x27;t have the option of constantly jacking their price up.  Suddenly, when it was student debt paying the bills, the colleges stopped doing anything to cut the bloat.<p>Thank you Berkeley for again reminding me what a scam the academic institutions have become.",1374091169

6059892,comment,6059170,6059625,6,0,noname123,,,"This is true. But IMO, there&#x27;s a difference between the idea of &quot;equality&quot; in the Chairman&#x27;s speech in People&#x27;s Congress and black people&#x27;s treatment in the open air market in Nanjing. As usual, &quot;equality&quot; is not altruistic.<p>Mao during the 1970&#x27;s Sino-Soviet split wanted to create his own ideological alternative as a third way to the American capitalist decadence and the Soviet revisionist. So he struck a lot of deals with African go&#x27;vt back then to give their students education grants to Chinese universities. I honestly don&#x27;t think Mao had an understanding of the African American experience in the sense of &quot;Invisible Man,&quot; &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; etc. but simply had an abstract understanding of &quot;third-world solidarity&quot;.<p>Nowadays, the Chinese leadership is helping Africa in the name of the third-way of &quot;peaceful rise&quot; and &quot;political non-interference to internal affairs&quot; as the alternative to &quot;America, the World Police&quot; of UN/IMF/World Bank. Again I don&#x27;t think Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping really relate to the health, socio-economic concerns of African people but simply wants access to the oil of Sudan and the soft power in the international stage.<p>All of this international diplomacy and economic deals does very little to affect the average Chinese person&#x27;s attitude towards African&#x27;s which is very racist. But I&#x27;d add that in my experience, racism is China is no worse than racism in America except the difference is that the average majority-member in the States is well-versed in political correctness or guilt that they know not to offend people in public and in private.<p>See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_anti-African_protests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_anti-African_protests</a>",1374091145

Black people were associated with poor African nations, so their prestige decreased. This was independent of any preferences for light and delicate features.<p>And I think this was one of the author&#x27;s points, that shifts in popular outlook have affected Chinese perceptions of black people.

Hi! I&#x27;m the person who convinced Ramit to quit his day job and do this blogging/product thing full time several years ago. I also know Patrick personally and it&#x27;s an interesting comparison you are making between the two of them.<p>> In only 3 years since the book he&#x27;s convinced individuals to drop $2-15k on the promise that he can help them get a better job.<p>I understand the skepticism around Ramit&#x27;s products, especially from the HN crowd. However, knowing Ramit and having been through his products as a reviewer, they are stellar, and the results he gets for his students are meticulously documented. That&#x27;s not to say they&#x27;re for everyone--as an entrepreneur myself, I didn&#x27;t get as much value as a job-seeker would have, and Ramit is probably a couple years away from creating a product geared toward entrepreneurs.<p>Knowing both Ramit and Patrick, the main similarity I see is both have a deeply analytical mind. Neither takes anything for granted, and they&#x27;re both fanatical testers...not just with marketing copy, but also with their products. Ramit goes to ridiculous levels to make sure his products are bar none the best out there. He spends hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on salaries and hiring the best people so that his products can be the top of their class.<p>Patrick is a bit different, as he got burned on consulting (I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll tell that story when he&#x27;s ready) and went back to focusing on products. He&#x27;s newer to the info product segment than Ramit, and a little more gun-shy when it comes to aggressive sales. (Ramit uses more aggressive sales tactics because he strongly feels--and has the testimonials to back it up--that he does have the best stuff out there.) Patrick is more cautious, as a geek first and foremost, and someone who built up his list through Hacker News and other geek-oriented websites.<p>In neither case would I hesitate to buy one of their products that was aimed in my direction or endorse them for other folks in their respective target markets. Both Patrick and Ramit operate from a foundation of integrity and putting the best stuff out there. I&#x27;m fortunate to count both of them as friends and mentors.",1374089646

In fact, Chinese foreign policy \n  in the 1960s mirrored much of that of the West, due in part \n  to the Sino-Soviet split and the coming dtente with the \n  U.S.\n\n  After the deaths of Mao and Zhou Enlai, the era of \n  alignment with the developing world and oppressed peoples \n  gave way to Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s pragmatic plan for economic \n  development epitomized by his statement, &quot;To get rich is \n  glorious.&quot; From the 80s to the present, this new mantra has \n  fueled a single-minded devotion to the pursuit of wealth, \n  leaving little room for concern with past ideals. \n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;past ideals&quot; promoted by Mao included the mass murder of tens of millions of Chinese and almost thirty years of terror and poverty, from the Great Leap Forward through the Cultural Revolution.

In a RealCrowd LLC, you have an ownership stake in a company that owns real estate. The number of properties owned by the company may differ, but that&#x27;s no justification for implying that there&#x27;s a real structural difference in what the investor actually owns.<p>2. <i>Every</i> REIT will tell you the same thing about their managers.<p>3. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s solving anything. You&#x27;re asking your investors to perform the same function as experienced professionals who get paid to manage real estate investments. Might some of your investors do well with this approach? Sure, but there are plenty of individual traders who handily beat hedge fund managers too (not hard these days). But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a good idea for the average investor to become an active trader.<p>4. The goal is not always to go public and not all non-traded REITs are successful in going public even if they want to, but it should be noted that recent liquidity events for non-traded REITs have generally been boons for the investors. Even so, at the end of the day, unless you&#x27;re buying and managing property on your own, you should feel confident that the people managing your investment are going to do what&#x27;s best for your investment or you shouldn&#x27;t invest. Generally speaking, the more options they have, the better. I could easily argue that a vehicle with no option to entertain a public listing is potentially disadvantaged.<p>5. Fair enough, but calling shares in a REIT a &quot;financially engineered product&quot; is an odd angle for a company targeting investors who are likely to be more sophisticated than average. REITs are not exotic financial instruments so in my humble opinion, this description is over-the-top and doesn&#x27;t help your positioning.",1374088013

I certainly don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s a simple language though. There are myriad rules and exceptions to rules to remember.  When and where one integer type will be converted to another. When overflow is defined and when it&#x27;s undefined. Just those things alone mean that much real world C code is full of  undefined behaviour[1] just related to arithmetic on numeric types, because the rules are hard to remember and reason about.<p>John Regehr asked people to submit str2long() implementations that didn&#x27;t execute undefined behaviour. Despite being well warned about avoiding overflows and other undefined behaviour only 35 of the 78 submissions passed the test suite[2].<p>Even a trivially small 2 line C function can result in different results on the common compilers depending on which compiler and which optimisation level you use[3]. Compiler engineers struggle to agree on and correctly implement the &quot;simple&quot; rules of C. To me that&#x27;s an indication that they aren&#x27;t so simple.<p>I would say that C doesn&#x27;t do anything behind your back as long as you don&#x27;t ever use an optimising compiler or you pay very very close attention to the standard.  If you forget then suddenly your check for pointer arithmetic overflow has been &quot;helpfully optimised away&quot; behind your back for reasons that are not immediately apparent at all[4].<p>I do agree that apparently simple rules can lead to complexity in use, and C is full of this too. For example you would think in a lower level language like C viewing a chunk of memory as a different type would be trivial, but the strict aliasing rule means you have to be a language lawyer to understand what is allowed and what isn&#x27;t[5] as it makes the intuitive solution into undefined behaviour (which is extra pernicious since most of the time it will work as intended, until somebody compiles the code with a smarter compiler at a high optimisation setting).<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/963"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/963</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/914"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/914</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/482"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/482</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~xi/papers/stack-sosp13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~xi/papers/stack-sosp13.pdf</a> example 1<p>[5] <a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/959"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/959</a>",1374087829

This reduces your need to understad what eventually becomes (commonly in projects) massive classes with lots of responsibilities. But more so than that, in DCI you create a Context object whose responsibility is to coordinate objects and the roles they play: the Context represents your algorithm. This allows you to point to an object that is responsible for a business use case, rather than what is typically done by having methods strewn about the classes of you system with no indication of when they are needed.",1323345401

I don't think this is the killer feature for DCI though; you can do this with other OO methodologies just as well.<p>DCI's main advantage is that it encourages you to write code that follows an ""assemble the objects I need, then perform a sequence of operations on them"" pattern, where the operations generally occur inside a single method.  This is your algorithm, and the idea is that you should be able to read that algorithm and get a good idea of what the program is doing.  Instead of relying on tests <i>alone</i> to verify that your program does what it's meant to, you should be able to <i>read</i> the code too.<p>Jim Coplien's talk here is a good intro: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/The-DCI-Architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/The-DCI-Architecture</a>",1323345339

3328717,comment,3325197,3328098,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"EF seems very much targeted towards ""enterprisey"" line of business apps, where ease of development is critical and performance is a side note. Microsoft just does not care to make a high-performance web stack. Even in the next generation of Visual Studio ASP.NET MVC stuff is still an optional download. How many production sites in the world are using EF? Microsoft is still very much mired in the idea of selling tools to developers who tend to be on the lowest rung of the skill-tree and who build mediocre internal apps at big companies. They're solution to scaling and efficiency is to buy bigger boxes, higher end Windows licenses, and more of them.<p>That strategy has certainly fattened their wallets handsomely over the last several decades, but it's ultimately self-defeating. By failing to capture the most skilled developers, and by failing to cater to the most critical development needs (high-throughput business critical web services being a prime example) they have been alienating such developers. And those developers are ultimately the ones who set the standards (in some cases literally, when they are in positions of power at large companies) that other developers tend to follow. And that momentum can be difficult to break. By the time MS realizes it they will be obsolete faster than they can react. And it won't be because the entire world changed overnight, it'll be because the world has been changing for a long long time and it will have finally caught up to their core business.",1323344924

How we reached to rails from PHP or cgi. How treacherous the journey was.<p>Rails just has too much magic and higher level of abstraction built in that it easier for beginners, But when you want to do something really great you need to look under the hood. That is RUBY, Rack and HTTP.<p>Because sooner or later you will realize that a web app is nothing more than HTML/CSS/Javascript so you know the nuts and bolts of the underlying infrastructure the better.<p>I think learning something as basic as sinatra is much better than learning rails , so that you have some idea of the underlying stuff and then when you move to rails you can learn more of rails by just looking at its code.<p>Personally i learnt a great deal from looking at rails source than looking at a tutorial. But surely it would be a daunting task for a noob. Also learning Rack comes naturally with sinatra. and as you look at Rack, sooner or later you would figure out how to write a cgi adapter for your rack app.<p>Then Comes rails which saves you from all the mundane task you were doing developing in sinatra and much more.<p>This way you would have a better understanding and appreciation for rails and all the stuff that you don't have to do or write in rails.<p>At the same time you will have a better understanding of how a particular feature is working in rails. This improves your debugging skills because you know where to look for when something goes wrong.<p>Finally Ruby is the elephant in the room so you need to be better at ruby to become excellent at rails, Which often is shadowed by the magic that rails provides, so learning RUBY first is more important than rails, sinatra or anything.",1323344892

Some of this stuff may not be relevant to your daily life but in general a lot of jobs and general task's in day to day life touch on the key Math skills you learned in school.<p>School should provide you with a firm foundation in key subjects. If 5 years later you have forgotten 70% of what you learned in science because your job doesn't involve this knowledge and you have no interest in reading / keeping up with science in general it doesn't matter. The chances are you will have remembered 90% of what you learned in English and 80% of what you learned in Math because these you depend on to complete your work.<p>It doesn't matter that a board member completely flunked a Math exam. It doesn't make him stupid. What is worrying is the attitude the educator takes to his failure. The best response is 'wow compared to these kids I am really rusty at Math.' The worst response is 'my math skills are OK, this test is irrelevant to day to day life.' It undermines teachers and tells kids it is OK to be terrible Math.

Any machinery that is in heavy use usually gets fitted, appropriately, with more robust set of parts which last many times longer before wearing out.<p>Current consumer cars have bearings, joints, and moving parts that are carefully optimized to match the expected usage pattern (which is mostly idle) for a designated period of time and nothing more. That's why older cars can sometimes run for ages. Decades ago we didn't know how to make extremely light-weight parts from least amount of steel with a calculable expiry time of, for example, 40 thousand miles so engineers had to fit cars with slightly heavier and more expensive parts to make sure they didn't break <i>too easily</i>. Think about fitting bearings and joints from a heavy van into a light Japanese small car. Or consider old 70's-80's Saabs and Volvos that can last nearly forever.<p>Likewise for fluids and lubrication, it's easier to clock high mileages with a car that is mostly in use throughout the day rather than with one that is used a couple of times a day for commuting.

Throwing a textbook, or your phd buddy's anecdotes in my face does not negate what i say.</i><p>I did not cite the textbook as an appeal to authority: I cited it because you repeatedly demonstrated that you don't understand what I'm saying, and kept making ludicrous arguments as a result, and reading that book (or a similar one) would be the only way for you to gain the necessary domain knowledge in order to say something meaningful on this subject.<p>Similarly, I raised the issues of my peer's thesis work not as an ""appeal to authority,"" but as a concrete example of the limitations of machine learning as an engineering tool.<p>You, on the other hand, used Andrew Ng's repeatedly as an appeal to authority.  The worst part is that your primary example was factually incorrect: you initially stated that he was some kind of wunder-kind who was able to easily solve a problem that had supposedly been impossible for regular aero engineers to solve; when I pointed out that regular aero engineers had, in fact, solved the problem two decades before his birth, you responded with the absurd claim that his work was somehow superior, despite a complete lack of evidence to support that position.<p>Moreover, saying, ""you do not know what you are talking about on this subject"" is not an insult.  I tried saying it more subtly at first, with attempts to fill some of the gaps in your domain knowledge, and yet you persisted in making arguments based on terribly insufficient knowledge of the subject under discussion, so I came out and said it explicitly.  When I did so, I even provided a text you could read in order to correct your ignorance, but you chose to reject that as ""appeal to authority.""<p>><i>The fact that you've somehow been granted a doctorate further confirms my suspicions about the quality of education these days.</i><p>I never claimed to have a PhD.  I have clearly stated that I have a MS in Aero.<p>><i>The simplicity/non-pioneering-ness of your phd buddies's theses' is further confirmation of that.</i><p>Just as you claimed that Andrew Ng's helicopter was somehow superior to other autonomous helicopters, even though you know nothing about those other helicopters, you now claim that the graduate thesis of two complete strangers are ""simple"" and ""non-pioneering"" based on a few sentences I wrote.  Throughout this conversation, you have displayed this habit of reaching unreasonable conclusions based on insufficient evidence.  Your arguments would be much more plausible of you would get rid of this habit.<p>><i>Of course searching can result in local minima. -That Exactly- is why you have to keep to keep running computers and getting more data. You can keep chanting to yourself - i am clever, i am clever, i write equations - and tell everyone the problem is difficult, years out from solution - or you can switch on the damn computers and let them find your answer.</i><p>This sums up the fundamental problem with your views.  I have stated repeatedly that machine learning has its uses, but that it also has its limits, and that many aspects of engineering and design are still best conducted by human beings.  I have given several examples to demonstrate this.  You have this inexplicable <i>faith</i> that any problem can be solved just by throwing enough data and computers at it.  It would be wonderful if only all engineering problems were that easy to solve.  Unfortunately, it's just not true.  If it were true, people would be disrupting the industry en masse by having computers design superior products faster and cheaper than human engineers can.  You even add a touch of ""No True Scotsman"" to your reasoning: if you don't get magical results from your machine learning, it must be because you're doing it wrong: not enough data, or not enough computers, or you didn't spend enough time tweaking it; just throw more time and money at it, and <i>then</i> you'll get the answer.",1323342795

This was not something I was taught to do in college or from books on UI or watching keynote speeches.<p>I learned user experience from Shigeru Miyamoto via Super Mario Brothers and the Legend of Zelda.<p>When consoles started to gain more horsepower and graphics became a primary selling point in games, I was never seduced by polygon counts or FMV cut scenes. I wanted better controls. I wanted more immersive level design.<p>More than anyone that's had influence on me as a developer, Miyamoto has inspired me to make software for people.<p>As an aside, do you think there's any way we can get him to make an HTML 5 game? Or series of games on some sort of Miyamoto blog?<p>Forking anything that Miyamoto has made would be the highlight of my professional life.",1323342014

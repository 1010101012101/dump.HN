In my department, the SOP was to wine and dine both the recruits <i>and</i> the graduate students (free steak and all the booze you can drink in one night goes a long way when you&#x27;re earning 20k/year).  But the trick was that not everyone was invited, and, of course, it wasn&#x27;t very hard to figure out that the best way to be invited back for another round was to forget to mention all things you didn&#x27;t like about the university (and how long you&#x27;d been there).",1379980600
6434941,comment,6434325,6434770,2,0,nilkn,,,"The lifestyle you describe in San Francisco is unsustainable over the long run for most people. This is one reason why that lifestyle is considered to be more adolescent: it is not realistic for the average middle class person to maintain that lifestyle while having a family and eventually retiring comfortably.<p>San Francisco the city is eternally adolescent, but the people there are not. There are few long-term residents, and most people who move into the city will eventually move out because it is outrageously expensive (and it&#x27;s not a great environment for kids: it&#x27;s very dirty, not particularly safe, the public schools are generally terrible, etc.). That six figure salary is not doing you much good when your small and cramped house is well over $1M, you&#x27;re paying $1500/month in daycare, you eventually are paying $25k+/year for private schools (not college), and you&#x27;re hit by high income taxes before you even start making all those payments.<p>South Carolina is a place where people are less constrained financially.

6434937,comment,6431599,6431599,10,0,SimonPStevens,,,"There is a simple change Microsoft need to make to the Surface RT to make it viable.<p>Fix app compatibility.<p>Start by removing the artificial restriction on desktop apps. Currently desktop apps are restricted to those signed by Microsoft. If they were to remove this restriction there&#x27;s a whole load of apps that could be recompiled to target ARM and work on the RT desktop. Companies and open source devs would be far more willing to spend a small amount of time porting existing code bases to ARM than re-writing whole apps for &#x27;Metro style&#x27;.<p>On top of that, Microsoft already have a platform compatibility layer in .Net. And they clearly already have a ARM version of the .Net runtime as you can build Metro apps targeting .Net. It seems absolutely crazy that they don&#x27;t make use of this already existing compatibility layer that could allow <i>all</i> existing .Net apps to run on RT desktop <i>without change</i>. This would make the surface RT a far more interesting proposition for companies looking to deploy their internal homegrown enterprise apps to windows tablets.<p>This change would re-position the RT from it&#x27;s current state as a underwhelming curiosity who&#x27;s main competitor is IPads and Android tablets which have a wider range of apps (and are significantly cheaper in the case of some Android brands) to a true low-mid end laptop alternative with decent app support at a similar price point. The Surface pro stays as it is as a high end laptop alternative.",1379980489

This will be a really tough blow for the windows platform since the gamer demographic drives a lot of spending.
Also it points to a very deep strategic move by valve, vertically integrating the distribution channel and controlling a la Apple which and how games are experienced. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if valve built strong partnerships with hardware providers to provide a fully vertically integrated, key-in-hand gaming platform experience.
It is worth mentioning that valve also sells other types of programs through steam... and that it seems this will eventually mutate into it&#x27;s application store, centralizing the money management for steamOS in general and fully capturing the platform value.<p>A new apple but instead of &quot;think different&quot;, the idea will be &quot;play different&quot;",1379980408

6434925,comment,6433787,6433787,6,0,beloch,,,"The show gets some interesting aspects of physics culture right.  For example, there&#x27;s the chauvinism of theorists over experimentalists. I was a bit surprised by this when I first encountered it, but I soon came to realize it&#x27;s probably motivated by jealously and rejection.  Experimentalists operate under the constraint of having to realize a test of one theory and stick with that same theory for months or years at a time, but they get all the cool toys plus the potential for real &quot;Eureaka!&quot; moments (even if those are exceedingly rare). Most theorists would never admit to being jealous of this but, at the same time, they cannot deny being jealous when their colleagues get to work with experimentalists. There are a lot more theorists out there creating material to test than there are labs able to test material! Theorists need to develop tough skin to handle all the times their theories are dismissed as &quot;uninteresting&quot; by experimentalists who define &quot;interesting&quot; as &quot;something we can test&quot;. To make matters worse, many experimentalists are also damned good theorists.  They&#x27;re the physics-world equivalent of geniuses who are also first-class jocks!<p>It makes sense for Sheldon to be the ultimate theorist chauvinist since he works with string theory, which is, so far, not of much interest to experimentalists because its so impractical to test! Salzburg is definitely a theorist, and it shows.  The whiteboards may be correct most of the time, but the lab scenes are just painfully bad!  All they really amount to is, &quot;Hey look!  Lasers!&quot;.  Having a consultant around to check your white-boards is fine, but they should send the writers to intern in an experimental lab for a bit if they ever want to move past seeing the world through Sheldon&#x27;s eyes.<p>P.S. I specifically watched this show because, when you tell people you work in physics, BBT is the first thing they think of. If there&#x27;s a TV show specifically about your profession it&#x27;s surprisingly awkward to be completely ignorant of it!",1379980213

To this day, it&#x27;s very difficult for a foreign firm to get started without a local partner in any of those countries.<p>Yes, their societies might be more open (though, w.r.t. to China, I find even that assertion to be dubious), but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re accepting of foreign capital investment. Capital investment is accepted very cautiously, because all these countries have learned the lesson that the &quot;Asian tigers&quot; were taught in 1997.

Lots of Gmail users do those things, and I reject the notion that email providers should just cede that ground to proprietary communication silos.<p>The point that I was trying to get across in that article was not that all messages should be shorter.  Rather, that the form of the composition UI sets expectations for what the message itself should look like.  The form of Gmail&#x27;s old compose set the expectation that it was a formal medium; that writing something short might not be appropriate, and that writing an email should be like writing a memo in a word processor.  That makes messages feel less immediate, less personal, and as a result raises the bar for sending shorter and/or personal messages.<p>The goal was not to prevent users from writing long messages, but rather to provide a better balance between the two.  Ultimately, though, this isn&#x27;t a personal vs work issue.  Facilitating short messages is arguably even more important in work settings where everybody tends to be inundated by large amounts of legitimate work-related email. There is real value in having a UI that gives users signals that it is ok to write shorter messages.<p>At the same time, on a 1366x768 browser window I can fit more than 3 paragraphs of lorem ipsem from <a href=""http://www.lipsum.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lipsum.com/</a> in the default Gmail compose window before it even starts to scroll.

The Surface is not a pick-up-and-go sort of device.<p>It&#x27;s a laptop with a mutli-touch display.<p>I&#x27;m building a program right now for Windows 8, on Dell hardware[1]. I&#x27;ve gotten quite used to the OS by now, and as long as you have a touch display, it doesn&#x27;t really deserve the criticism I&#x27;ve read.

Hence job 1 is to change it.  The odd part is looking at the other t-shirt sites that are popular and doing well their designs seem to be only so-so, and overall look like they were stamped from a mold.  Also most are not mobile friendly at all, we are at least mostly responsive and operational on a mobile device too.<p>This is not to say we made some radically cool design that is better, obviously, plus we used a template to save time for the initial launch.  We were trying to do some things differently, like not cramming shirt designs with no whitespace and hiding prices until you get into the details of the shirt, or in a lot of cases until you go to checkout. I was trying to not do that but obviously these other sites design must work. And since ours is lacking a conversion rate I would call successful, we have to adapt.<p>I also evaluated price again today when I was bouncing around other sites.  Someone else brought that up, which to me is always worth evaluating. Overall for those sites using the same quality shirts, once you checkout they we are all within a few dollars of each other, with us being middle of the pack usually.  There are some shirts that are high discount mass produced tees that you can get for 19 shipped.<p>I am thinking we are also suffering though because we don&#x27;t call it out in a bold way saying shipping is always free in the US.  That could make people see a $18-25 shirt and they mentally do the math of another 6-8 dollars and say hell no thats way too expensive.

This would give Xbox One and PS4 a run for their money and with the social aspects of Steam built-in, this could be a break out hit with a price of 50% all the other consoles.<p>Announcement 3, is the large unknown here. We don&#x27;t know what it is, but if it is bigger (or equal to) SteamBox this could be a huge deal. Nothing really makes sense here. We know:<p>* SteamBox will support streaming from your windows/mac machine so it will be able to run every game at launch.<p>* SteamBox will likely have lots of publishers signed on. Probably as many or more then on xbox one / ps4. If they are already using an engine that targets multiple platforms (Unreal or Unity) they are definitely going to try to support it.<p>* SteamBox will likely support all the features of steam with friend lists, chat, voice, purchasing over the cloud, etc. So the + might mean sharing, but a new kind?<p>* SteamBox supports game sharing at a friends or family level. I see this as a kind of Netflix-like persona idea: an account gains separate personas that each have different friends lists and achievements. Very powerful and necessary once Steam hits the living room and multiple people are using the same box / account.<p>What it could be:<p>* LAN play for SteamBoxs on the same network (announced in Dota, this could explain the circle + circle graphic). Maybe you share the game between friends, and stream to the other boxes? That would be pretty awesome.<p>* Game streaming from other people&#x27;s SteamBoxs? This would be an awesome way to share a game. It is like onlive but for distributed for everyone (seems unlikely. That kind of streaming would stop your friends from being able to play).<p>* A launch title like Half-life 3 (seems unlikely with the circle + circle logo implying you need multiple SteamOS instances).<p>* A new kind of social experience, maybe a built in way to be a part of the game creation process or improved social network experiences on Steam (seems unlikely to be big enough to be the final announcement)<p>* A new kind of hardware like a VR headset(seems unlikely, as cheap will be a big feature of this box)<p>This is marketing at its best.

By forcing kids to go to school through 18 where they make basically NO choices that affect their lives, are taught things that more than half the time the teachers can&#x27;t even tell them why they need to know them (&quot;for college&quot; isn&#x27;t a real answer, either) -- all of this treats them like infants.<p>Even infants manage learn to speak and walk without being &quot;taught&quot; a thing. Forcing kids to go through a lock-step learning regimen just teaches them that their desires aren&#x27;t important, and they end up rebelling.<p>If you look at kids from Sudbury schools [1], or kids who have been (competently) &quot;Unschooled&quot; [2], they typically seem to be mature for their age, polite, and reasonably well-spoken. By respecting the kids and giving them freedom at a young age, they act more mature.<p>See also Paul Graham&#x27;s essay on &quot;Nerds&quot; [3], where he talks about (among other things) the completely artificial environment that is the broken schooling paradigm in the US, and in much of the world.<p>>In my opinion by 15 or 16 people should already be expected to act like adults.<p>If you treat them that way, for real, then they will. But that includes not forcing them into the stupidly artificial and even actively damaging [4].<p>Someday I want to fix this problem. If I end up involved in a start-up, fixing education -- REALLY fixing it, not just doing &quot;more of the same&quot; and calling that an improvement -- will be at the core.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_school"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_school</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://sandradodd.com/unschooling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a> -- briefly, the kids are allowed to learn what they want.

This, of course, is the single biggest point of The Wealth Of Nations, and it&#x27;s an interesting one, and seems to be largely correct.  But if you take this to an illogical extreme, you are back in might-makes-right.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that slavery wasn&#x27;t defeated by capitalism, but rather by a leftist people-other-than-the-rich-have-rights kind of movement.  Master Smith had the capital, he bought the slaves, and now we&#x27;re going to deny him his property rights, because someone else&#x27;s rights (to freedom and personal security) are more important.<p>Feudalism is also basically free-capitalism-plus-ethics.  If you conquer some land by the sword, you get to keep it.  There are some people living on that land.  You tell them &quot;I own this land, if you want to live you can either leave (flee as refugees), or trade me your right to freedom and security for the permission to use my land, with the following caveats&quot;.  I say &quot;plus ethics&quot; because there was an ongoing debate throughout the feudal period about what obligations the landed class had to the working class, a debate that is taken less seriously today.<p>And for that matter, cronyism is consistent with pure capitalism; why shouldn&#x27;t I, the holder of capital, be allowed to allocate that capital however I like, including to my cronies?<p>I apologize if this is all sort of obvious, or pedantic.  And overall, I favor socio-political systems that are more capitalist than anything else.

That marks a sea change where, among all sorts of other changes, people stop maturing based on time and so, from then on, primarily mature based on experience.<p>What we&#x27;re seeing here is the steady march of a feedback loop that began when the terms &#x27;teenager&#x27; and &#x27;adolescent&#x27; appeared.

Young, inexperienced adults, but adults nonetheless.<p>Then teenager-hood was invented as a phase of life and the line began creeping upwards. They were no longer adults; now they were old children: not yet responsible for themselves and their actions.<p>The feedback loop comes from removing opportunities to gain life experience: treating someone aged X like a child means that they will gain less experience and therefore mature less by age X+1. If this happens to a whole cohort, it means that people aged X+1 will start looking more like children, which will cause older generations to treat them as children. Then the cycle repeats at age X+2 in a new cohort.<p>Apparently today, we&#x27;re seeing the line creep into the early 20s.",1379978263

Strictly speaking, it&#x27;s actually impossible for NSA employees/contractors to &quot;listen to&quot; more than a tiny fraction of them, there simply aren&#x27;t enough human-hours to do that. Nobody seriously thought that the NSA actually had a human being snooping on every phone call.<p>So the people say &quot;You&#x27;re recording our calls!&quot; And the official answer is &quot;Well we&#x27;re not actually listening to them. We analyze the crap out of the metadata, though.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m still OK with calling that &quot;discounting.&quot;",1379977416

Yale you&#x27;re probably okay, but at Harvard, Stanford, and Columbia you&#x27;re still going to have to be in at least the top half (maybe top third) of your class to have a good chance of getting a job that can cover your loan payments, and that job will be at biglaw and you will almost certainly hate your life. If you can get a full ride to a top 14 school, it&#x27;s probably worth going (these exist, but are <i>extremely</i> uncommon). If you get into Yale, that&#x27;s probably also worth it (the way smaller class size compared to Harvard or Stanford helps a lot). Other than that, law school is probably a bad idea.",1379977321

There is a wealth of biological evidence to show that a human&#x27;s brain doesn&#x27;t finish maturing until (approx.) age 25. By that standard you could make the argument that 25 is when people reach adulthood.<p>Of course, what we&#x27;re really talking about here is expectations of responsibility, so even though &quot;by 15 or 16 people should already be expected to act like adults&quot; these young people still have maturing to do.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising that in our rich modern society the age of &#x27;adulthood&#x27; has risen to 25, especially considering we live so much longer than we used to.",1379977239

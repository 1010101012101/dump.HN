It was the only laptop with enough screen real estate and power to work as a desktop on the road.<p>But lately with the increasingly draconian carry-on restrictions I've downsized my luggage, and turns out my MPB17 <i>just barely</i> doesn't fit in a 16x13x7 bag (that fits in the new commuter jet regs).  The MBPr15 fits, has <i>more</i> screen res, and is lighter.  So I had been planning an upgrade.  If the new MBPr13 had dual graphics I'd be willing to even go with that as it would fit in my puddle jumper bag's outside pocket.<p>But... This past year the outsized MBP17 had me trying out my iPad 3 instead, and now I'm not sure I need a laptop for travel at all.",1354802358

4881710,comment,4878403,4881266,3,0,kibwen,,,"I agree that Github offers superb code browsing, and their issue tracker seems to be reasonably usable for small projects.<p>However, I fear that Github's issue tracker might not work at scale. I closely follow just one ""large""[1] project that's hosted on Github; most of the developers on that project are accustomed to Bugzilla. Now I've never even used Bugzilla myself, but here are some things off of the top of my head that I remember them longing for:<p>1) The ability to attach files to issues.<p>2) The ability to denote dependencies between issues and generate dependency diagrams.<p>3) The ability to assign priority to issues (achievable using tags, but perhaps there's some advanced functionality I'm not aware of).<p>4) Ability for users to vote on which issues are most important.<p>5) Advanced search options (sometimes just having even <i>basic</i> search would be nice... half the time I have better luck searching their issues via Google than using Github's own search tool[2]).<p>6) A responsive web front-end.<p>The reason that they use Github's built-in issue tracker in the first place is because everyone and their mother has a Github account, so it lowers the barriers to entry for filing a bug report. And there's no question that they've benefited enormously from this, and the user-engagement that it enables. But the detriments to productivity are real, and the advantage of Github's network effect hasn't stopped them from repeatedly considering migrating their issues to Bugzilla.<p>And I don't think it would kill Github to abandon their ""tags fulfill EVERY USE CASE"" position and bake in some more features for advanced users, especially if they hope to capture a bigger share of the more ""serious""[2] projects out there (which would only be to their benefit, considering that ""serious"" projects are the ones that are willing to buy paid accounts for all the users in their organization).<p>[1] ""Large"" in this case meaning: hundreds of Github forks, thousands of Github stars, hundreds of thousands of lines of code, a half-dozen full-time developers, and, most pertinently, several thousand issues (and growing at an increasing rate).<p>[2] Case in point: I just now tried to search for the issue wherein I offered to do the legwork of migrating their database to Bugzilla should it come to that. The title of the issue contains the word ""Bugzilla"". The text of the issue itself contains the word ""Bugzilla"" multiple times. Several of the comments contain ""Bugzilla"". And yet a search for ""Bugzilla"" using Github's issue search tool reveals only one issue, completely unrelated to the issue I was looking for.<p>[3] ""Serious"" in this case meaning: a codebase with hundreds of thousands to millions of users, dozens of full-time developers, and hundreds of thousands of issues.[4]<p>[4] <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=800000"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=800000</a> [5]<p>[5] Help I've gone mad with footnote power [5]<p>[6] While you're here, fun fact: I once went looking for the Github project with the largest number of total issues, and here's what I eventually settled upon: <a href=""https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues</a>",1354802302
4881709,comment,4880466,4881206,3,0,greedo,,,"Lets address the ""facts"" you posit.<p>1. Recent releases of OSX have sucked more than earlier releases? Can't agree with that. I've used OSX since the beta days, and both Lion and ML are far more polished and usable. OSX was like a breath of fresh air compared to OS9, so of course it ""felt"" better. But there were tons of bugs that have slowly been stomped out. You may not like some of the current features of OSX ML, but the previous versions aren't unequivocally better.<p>2. Hardware lockdown. I have fond memories of using a kitchen knife to open up a Mac mini to replace memory. Yesterday I bumped my 2012 mini to 16GB with a simple twist. The Mac Pro is the same as it was when released. Some of the notebooks are more accessible, some less so. Replacing the hard drive on my wife's G4 powerbook involved something like 30 screws, and hoping that I didn't bend anything out of tolerance. Today that's far different; even the MacBook air has fewer parts and steps involved.",1354802295

Then, when they finally matched Google, Google raised their cap to 1GB.<p>In this case, manufacturers will have to work hard to match Apple's bring-mfg-to-the-US actions, but won't even be on the same playing field, since Apple's worked so hard to maximize the efficiency of their supply chain.",1354802295

It was actually very similar to Nextel's earlier fast rise and collapse.<p>They saw erosion in their enterprise sales, but missed the fact that the superior web browsing experience and eventually applications on the iPhone was driving folks away. They honestly thought that their keyboard was still a key differentiator that folks cared about.<p>So they stuffed the channel in the low end of the market, and pushed the cheap text messaging of BBM as the core offering. Suddenly sketchy cell phone kiosks are pushing BlackBerries, and they became the new T-Mobile Sidekick. Just like with Nextel, that low end push tainted the brand, as thugs and drug dealers learned quickly that BBM (like DirectConnect) was initially not interceptable.",1354802260

Somebody who likes some company a lot, and buys their gadgets and thinks the stuff the company makes is swell, but is able to afford the fact that their company does do things wrongly sometimes is <i>not</i> a fan boy -- they're a fan and I don't think anybody has a problem with fans.<p>People who act as consistent apologists, who's identity is made up of their allegiance to this company and who react with shock and indignation that anybody could even <i>propose</i> that the company they've devoted a significant part of their psyche and lives to, could in any way be flawed...are fan boys. And they bring discourse to a halt by increasing the noise in a conversation to the point entire forums become useless, and actual fans get caught up in the crossfire...it's really frustrating and annoying.<p>And if you read all that and thought I was talking about Apple then you've missed the point. This exists as a kind of mixed-identification phenomenon exists across a broad spectrum of milieus. Car brands, politics, religion, etc. And it's to the benefit of these brands that they identify and recruit the people who are susceptible to fan boyism and use them as a deep pool of loyal customers and a passive defense to their organization's operations. Why try and spend time fighting off stories of negative aspects of your company when you have a million fan boys who'll do it for you?<p>And it's the constant noise they introduce, either in the form of an echo chamber of reinforcing good feeling but content free interactions or in the form of constant nonsensical diatribes and willfully ignorant defenses of their brand identity, that's why it's important for any on-line community to try and either turn fan boys into rational thinkers -- to separate the person's identity from the brand -- or drive them from the community.<p>HN is a place that needs signal, not noise.

Some want censorship to be built-in, so that their political dissidents cannot simply use VPNs, proxy servers, or Tor to evade national firewalls.<p>To put it another way, the US government's approach to censorship of the Internet is mostly a combination of rare and costly raids on server rooms, hijacking domain names, and arresting people who download illegal pornography.  China's approach is to have tens of thousands of government workers laboring 24 hours per day to identify websites that go too far in contradicting the Communist party's official policies, maintaining an enormous national firewall, and attacking Tor network connections to prevent people from evading the firewall -- and they also raid server rooms and arrest people who possess the wrong information.

It's because Google is not a hardware company & does not expect their margins to come from devices. If you step back a little to contemplate the entirety of their business plan, you'll see that the see devices as conduits for their services & that's where their profits comes from, ad impressions.So, the fact they're selling their devices to break-even is only a piece of the puzzle.",1354799170

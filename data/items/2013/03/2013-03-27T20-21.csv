Basically the only thing which is correct is:<p>> In Erlang, it is idiomatic to let your functions fail<p>And even that has to be stretched: in Erlang, it is idiomatic to let your <i>process</i> fail (throwing exceptions is rare, catching them is rarer still, the average Erlang program will likely do neither ""procedurally""). Because idiomatic erlang separates processing an error recovery, and <i>an other</i> process will handle error recovery for the failing one. Furthermore he conflates error handling and failing, when Erlang very much separates them (error handling is done via return values, in a terser yet more explicit way than Go)<p>The rest is worse.",1364417873

5451952,comment,5451651,5451651,9,0,chimeracoder,,,"> In Go, you handle errors, and hence you manage everything about your goroutines and in-process servers. In Erlang, the language handles errors, and you have to manage the consequences of those errors. The Go implementation is more straightforward, while the Erlang implementation involves more callbacks and indirection.<p>I haven't used Erlang, but that sums up my experience with Go very well. Coming from Python, the hardest thing for me to adjust to was <i>not</i> the concurrency model (which is incredibly straightforward), but the error handling.<p>That said, the adjustment was worth the effort. I've come to dislike the idea of my functions failing (panic()nig) because of some nested function call four, five, six levels deep. Returning error codes makes the error handling explicit, and because the compiler complains about unused lvalues, it makes it easy to spot code where the errors are ignored (just look for underscores)[0]. Contrast to Python, where it's almost impossible to tell whether or not I need to wrap a given call in a try/except block without digging deeper into the code.<p>It makes writing concurrent code much more logical, because it couples the error handling more closely with the spot at which the error occurs, while at the same time giving the option to let errors 'bubble up' as needed. It's not <i>quite</i> the same way that Lisp handles conditions so, <i>so</i> elegantly[1], but it's about the closest I'd expect in a C-style language.<p>[0] Or you could not assign the single return value of a function that returns an error, but since pretty much everything returns an error (whether or not you pay attention to it), 
'naked' function calls are just as suspicious.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-co...</a>",1364417622

5451916,comment,5451651,5451651,64,0,jerf,,,"Erlang's error checking model is a great deal more like Go's than he thinks. Erlang is in the ""exceptions are exceptional"" camp too, and idiomatic code should not be throwing exceptions around willy-nilly.<p>Go is noticably more fragile with errors. Unhandled exceptions (which are just a fact of life unless you're a perfect programmer) will result in the <i>entire program</i> terminating if you don't have something that handles it. This behavior is forced on it precisely because of the shared memory model (one of the <i>actual</i> big differences); if one goroutine has f'ed up, you simply don't know what the state of your program is anymore. (Theoretically you could do better than that, but not simply.) Since Erlang memory is isolated, it can kill just that one process, and the other processes can pick up the pieces. (Not necessarily perfectly or without loss, but in practice, really quite well.) Consequently, for any serious Go program, you're still going to have to choose an exception handling policy, it's not as if it has gotten away from exceptions. Failures are a fact of life... for all you know, memory was corrupted. Again, the difference here is not ""error handling policy"" but the longer term consequences of shared vs. isolated memory spaces. If you just type up idiomatic Erlang OTP code, you have to go out of your way to not have a bulletproof server; if you just type up idiomatic Go code it's on you to make sure you're not excessively sharing state and that you aren't going to see your entire server doing tens of thousands of things come down due to one unhandled exception. Go programmers need to be more worried about error handling in practice than Erlang programmers, since Erlang programmers aren't facing the termination of the entire world if they screw up one thing.<p>There's also a recurring pattern in newer language advocates in which they will in one year claim it's a good thing that they don't have X, and next year tout to the high heavens how wonderful it is that they just implemented X. I went around with the Haskell world on a couple of those issues (""no, strings are not linked lists of numbers"", ""yes they are you're just not thinking functionally and inductively dude, and by the way, six months later, check out this <i>totally radical</i> ByteString library, and when that still turns out not to be stringy enough hey, check out Data.Text six months later...""). Thinking you can get away without OTP is likely to be one of those for Go. No. You need it, though I have questions about whether it can even be built in Go, because one of the other actual differences between the languages...<p>... which is Channels vs. Processes. Go has channels, but you can't tell who or what has them, and there's no such thing as a ""goroutine reference"". By contrast, Erlang has processes, but no way to tell what messages they may send or receive, and there's no such thing as a ""channel"". Again, this has major impacts on how the system is structured, in particular because it is meaningful to talk about how to restart a ""process"" in a way that it is not meaningful to talk about how to restart a ""channel"".<p>Go advocates desperately, desperately need to avoid the temptation to explain to themselves why Erlang isn't as good, because then they'll fail to learn the lessons that Erlang learned the easy way. There's a <i>lot</i> of ways to improve on Erlang, but let me tell you that despite those opportunities, Erlang as a language is one of the <i>wisest</i> languages around, you <i>do not</i> want to try to exceed it by starting from scratch. Learn from it, <i>please</i>, I want a better Erlang than Erlang, but talking yourself into how Go is already better than Erlang isn't going to get you there.",1364417120
5451914,comment,5450097,5451627,2,0,rm999,,,"A large pain point for me is remembering the huge number of useful commands in R - I use at least 5-10x as many keywords in R as I did in C++. As I mention in another comment I basically need a reference (usually google and ?) at all times to keep track of these commands and their parameters. In many ways it's great that all these functions exist because I can analyze datasets an order of magnitude more quickly (in development time) than I could in a more traditional language, but developing in R is far more stressful to me. When I'm writing production-level code I constantly have to worry about readability and whether someone else who is reading my code will intuitively understand what I'm doing. With so many commands and so many ways to do things this can be challenging. I find my R code is often lower 'quality' than what I write in something like Python or C.<p>There are many little idiosyncrasies in R's syntax, I feel like I never grokked the language. For example, pretty much anytime I see '~' I have to relearn what is going on. From a mathematical perspective I appreciate that vectors are indexed from 1 instead of 0, but from a programming perspective it can be annoying.<p>BTW, thanks for contributing so many great things to R, I owe a lot of what I do to you.",1364417113

Just like C++11, Dart, Go, etc.<p>This kind of belligerent rhetoric (we're solving the right problems, everyone else is dumb) is the kind of drivel that gives momentum to language zealots that think language X is better than language Y.<p>I've contributed to Google Go in the early phases and I was nave and really believed that Go was the ""next big thing."" But it turned out to be yet another general-purpose language with some things that were really interesting (goroutines, garbage collection, etc.) but some things that were just same-old same-old. Now, I'm editing a book about Dart and I've since lost my enthusiasm for new languages; I can already see that Dart solves some problems but often creates new ones.<p>And in a lot of ways Erlang sucks, too. The syntax is outdated and stupid (Prolog lol), it has weird type coercion, memory management isn't handled that well (and many more). Of course, since Facebook uses it, people think it's a magic bullet (Erlang is to Facebook like Python is to Google).<p>The article also forces readers to attack a straw man.

Single thread performance has improved a lot due to better CPU architecture. Look at <a href=""http://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html</a> and compare CPUs with the same clock rate, where a 2.5 GHz. An April 2012 Intel Core i7-3770T scores 1971 points while a July 2008 Intel Core2 Duo T9400 scores 1005 points. This is almost double the score in less than four years. Of course, one factor is the larger cache that the quad core has, but this refutes Armstrong's point that the multicore age is bad for single thread performance even more.<p>For exposure to a more balanced point of view, I would highly recommend Martin Thompson's blog mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com. It is a good a starting point on how far single threaded programs can be pushed and where multi-threading can even be detrimental.<p>Also, I think that fault tolerance is where Erlang really shines.

The reason is because a general thrust of the paper (since I have only had time to give it a once-over) seems to be that just because you are a Bayesian it doesn't mean that you have to get rid of model adequacy checks.  Not having model adequacy checks is why I think Bayesians run around with a magic wand saying, ""poof! there's an optimal model.""  After proving a theoretical optimality they never check to see if the real world data supports their arguments.  So I'm glad to see a prominent Bayesian saying that you don't have to throw model checking out the window.<p>On a secondary note, I have to lament the use of philosopy in a math paper.  I realize that many prominent mathematicians are/were also philosophers and that the two subjects are somehow linked at some level.  But really I think that putting philosophy in a math paper is an excuse to use more big words and sound smart.  Most of us would like to have a set of formulas to apply and not worry about-- forgive me if I for what I'm about to say-- fuzzy non-science like philosophy and the implications that it might have on our cold hard numbers.<p>Can each 31 page paper that combines math with philosophy come with a 5 page companion paper that leaves out the philosopy and just has the applicable math stuff?",1364415075

In fact, I have hundred thousands years of experience wired in my brain.<p>Now, I only have a dozen years of experience with operating systems, programming languages, etc. I'm quite a technical user; I think I fit the definition of a computer geek, or power user. I have a talent to debug very nasty bugs in embedded, real-time software written in (unintentionally) obfuscated C. I can install and use OpenBSD, FreeBSD, etc. I can write small Scheme programs. And still, I feel Im trapped in a jungle I cant escape when Im using Mac OS X or Windows for everyday tasks. Our computing world is a live nightmare. Its a terrible, ugly mess. There really is a huge impedance mismatch between our brains and our computers.<p>Technology is designed (mostly) by people who think they live in a perfect, mathematically pure world. I cant really blame them; because by ""them"" I mean ""us"". But the real world is not binary; its fuzzy. As you said, it's messy. Its imperfect. It changes as our mood changes. Computers should reflect this. They dont.<p>I think that user interfaces that tried to mimic the real world failed because the people behind them still kept thinking as computer scientists, university professors or ubergeeks (they were lying to themselves). Some user interfaces were designed to treat the user like a five-year-old kid (hello Microsoft Clippy). Others were replicating real-world stuff that was badly designed in the first place (VCR control panels are a good example). And most of them focus on being cool demos with great eye candy (look at where desktop environments are heading; who fucking cares about translucent stuff, rotozooming windows animations, 3D?) Hollywood film-makers should take the blame here :)<p>At first, when I saw this project, I thought: ""yet another boring, eye-candy environment with cool tricks but no real innovation."" But I should try it; maybe the user experience really is improved. Its worth trying.<p>\n[Sorry about the whole rant tone of this post; itÂs not really a reply to your post either; consider it a draft of a work-in-progress essay Ill try to complete and improve over time.]\n",1181167127

I would look to see if you're competing with your employer, if you are not than there's not much to worry about, if you think you might be, check with an attorney.",1181166398

We're hoping the advantage of using microPledge will be that it's a central location people know about and will build up trust in. And also that the developer can focus on his project rather than on building a nice website with pledging functionality. (Our site's much more than just a SourceForge donate button -- but you'll have to wait and see. :-)",1181166269

But it also isn't the ease of use; The ease of use paradigm is yet another clever Apple marketing tactic to give people something to talk about when trying to explain to their friends why they made the decision to buy.  The real reasons people buy Macintosh (and I'm talking about the general public here, because admittedly, the personal preferences on this board are likely to be skewed) are subconscious:  People's brains notice that Apple products don't make the typical creaking/squeaking sound typical of tightly screwed together plastic parts when you touch them / pick them up.  People notice things like magnetic power cords on laptops and cases and accessories designed to flawlessly fit their products without a centimeter to spare.  People are influenced by what they see around them.  People want to fit in, and do what's relevant.  But most of all--and this is the one that a lot of us have trouble accepting--people care about style EVEN MORE than they do about function.  Don't believe me?  Take a look at how people dress.  If people cared most about function, every single person on this planet would be walking around in New Balance trainers (or maybe Crocs), basketball shorts/track pants, and a Wallmart t-shirt.  But instead, people pay hundreds of dollars for jeans that are far from functional.  And sure, you might argue that not everyone does that, but a lot of the people who are buying Apple's products do.<p>My theory on why they don't care about the Mac Pro?  They're phasing it out because Apple as a company is sustained by sexy, identifiable gadgets that are fun to flash and look at, and no matter what you do to the Mac Pro, it's still a computer tower.  You're never going to bring it on vacation.  You're never going to see it at a party.  You can't even take it out into your living room to show your friends when they come over.  The Mac Pro is a purely functional product, and Apple is about as much a functional company as C is a functional language.",1339467273

AT&T sells a 120-MB international roaming data package for $30/month. That implies an effective download charge of $4.55 for an 18.2-MB file.<p>Now if Amazon's data charge is $2.82 in the UK, where they do significant volume and the wireless market is competitive, imagine how much higher it must be in less developed countries where the company has less pull. I got charged approximately $800 for 40 megabytes of data usage in Lithuania last year, where AT&T did not have a partnership with any local carrier. I talked AT&T down to about $400 but they would not budge beyond that.<p>And think about the target audience for this book. Probably a lot of people spread out all over the world. It might not take all that many downloads in places like Lithuania to push the average delivery fee up to $2.48.<p>The only problem I see is that, arguably, Amazon should give authors the ability to opt out of paying for international downloads, or let them set different prices in different countries.<p>But it seems that the current delivery charge is pretty good - certainly it's not the enormous markup the headline claimed.",1339466409

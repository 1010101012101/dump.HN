The remaining 20% can be insightful (and provide useful terms with which to impress clients).",1230378087

If you are looking for a programming or design exercise and can't think of anything original, rewrite an app you like.",1230377607

Yes, he'll answer an email, but ask for more than that and I can guarantee what the answer will be.... Maybe he should just be ""Authentic"" about it and do a blog post which says: ""Look people, I am flattered at all the requests and X, Y and Z's I get. But you probably don't know that it amounts to many thousands of these a week and i just can't be now, what I was then. The good news for you is that my authentic method works.... up to a point... and that space is now open for you to take... Coz I'm just too big to do it now, to be authentic that is.... it was fun while it lasted...""<p>How about that Seth?<p>Steve Sammartino - \nwww.startupblog.wordpress.com",1230376633

If I type that on a Japanese keyboard, I get the katakana to match. Working out what the equivalent kanji are (if any in this case?) would be impossible to me.",1230376485

It's like watching Rumsfeld talk about Iraq and 9/11, never quite blaming them, but using the words closely together so people will get the desired idea.<p>Sure, technically nobody in the Bush administration said that Iraq did 9/11, but there's a reason that a huge swath of America thought they said it, and it wasn't accidental.  The same applies here.<p>Just because the guy rails against college, has wrote a book about the evils of ""multiculturalism"" at Stanford, and gives smart kids money to drop out and be publicized doesn't mean he's against college... he's just sending every possible signal that he is, whilst not quite making the statement.<p>It's a form of propaganda, and it works, because the signal still transmits fairly well, but whenever he's called out on it, somebody (you, in this case) will note that he never <i>exactly</i> stated the message that he's been working hard to convey, so it's a lie.

3692736,comment,3692257,3692257,6,0,kamaal,,,"I understand the true spirit of this post. But regarding finding the right tools for the job(which in this case is syntax highlighting) is worth chasing.<p>I was once helping out a relative of mine. Who was doing some freelance project in electronics. As a deliverable we had to ship some soldered boards in four days. We didn't quite have a organized working shop. The first night we worked it was a disaster. Nothing was in place, and we spent great deal of time solving confusions and finding scattered tools. Then the next day we spent all the day getting organized and finished the entire job the very next day. Getting organized helps.<p>But I noticed a strange thing during that project. As we were soldering, I realized apart from talking to each other about some topic intermittently. We never really got distracted and got off our seats and we were never distracted. We only took food and rest room breaks nothing more. How did that happen, I did simple analysis:<p><pre><code>    1. We were not spoiled by choice. Like in software where there are gazillion things and standards to choose from.\n    2. Focused task, Solder, pick components, debug, multimeter.\n    3. No such thing like a browser to distract.\n    4. Ability to measure goals. Something that is difficult to do in software.\n    5. Doing and exploring new things have a little higher barrier to entry. Thereby you don't shift tasks until you complete the current one completely.\n    6. Information available is to the point and not like software where every other blog has a hello,world program posted. Thereby doing something new requires iterations of focussed reading, implementing, testing.\n</code></pre>\nHaving said, this model is a little difficult to create in software. I guess Electronic engineers at a time were plagued with same problems decades back when they had 50 free PIC projects magazines near every door way. And having to worry about every new precision voltmeter that comes very other week.<p>Many of our problems will resolve automatically with some quality standardization in our industry.<p>We still quarrel about Text editors, things like syntax highlighting. Most technology communities should by now figure out that if you are releasing something cool, you also need to take care of the tooling.",1331541578

I believe social inequality is to blame here. People in poor neighborhoods know that basically whatever they do, legally, they will never live a good life - have a place to live, have a car, eat good food, live in a safe neighborhood, maybe travel once or twice per year. They have poor access to schooling, which leads to poor access to jobs, which leads to poor access to money, ... unless they do crimes (e.g. rob a bank, sell drugs, steal cars, kidnap people and demand ransom). I cannot speak from experience, because I was born rather privileged, but I imagine they don't even see this as unfair/immoral - there is nothing moral in one baby being born into a rich family and having all the options, and another being born to poor parents and thus having none. When you think of it, it might actually be immoral. Some criminals simply seek to correct this imbalance, to award themselves, and their kids, the opportunities that the society denied them.<p>Note that I am in no way trying to justify their behaviour, I'm just trying to understand it.

3844718,story,,,4,1,jkmurray,"Social Media - FaceBook is killing us",,"For over a year I've been a FaceBook-user. Not the one that uses it like Twitter and posts everything he's doing (like telling everyone what you have for dinner, the fact that your dog ate the newspaper of yesterday or you just found out that there's a new brand of toilet paper at the local store). I was more the 'reading' kind of guy. And it irritated me over time. Now the point came that I deleted my account (actually, you can't, you can just politely ask FaceBook to do that for you so they can backup all your information for further use). So why did I do it?<p>Privacy
Yeah, sure. If you want your life to be completely out there just open a FaceBook account, create a Google-account, get Twitter, Flickr and go online. Someone who really knows how to use this information has a nice overview of your life and everything you do. Counting in the fact that a huge amount of people do this, FaceBook becomes the place-to-be when you want to know something. Just imagine what would happen if this information would be freely available by the government or worse: the companies. Your life will be controlled by what you post and what you upload. And now I can hear you think: ""But I'm only uploading the things I want."" Here comes my second point.<p>Social
Being social these days means something different than a couple of years ago. Today it means having all the accounts, uploading everything you can and telling your friends all the nice things that happened to you that day. We share the nice parts of our life. We have over 100 friends who are all able to read it and react to it. A couple of years ago it meant that you and your friends went to a pub and talked about everything that happened in your lives. The good things and the bad things. It meant that you called a close friend and met each other to talk about the things that really matter. 
And that's where the whole difference is. For some reason we're not honest to ourselves when we are online. When we upload some images of our vacation, we just do that to show our so-called friends (more about that later) what a great time we can have with our loved-ones. Bought a new car? Upload it right now so the others can see how well you're doing. We're showing the world how well we're doing.<p>The last year hasn't been the best year for me personally. Some horrible things happened. And not the things like: my car broke down three times. Let's put it this way: I've been shown who really are my friends. In comparison to the huge friend-lists some people have, it's nothing. But for me it's the most valuable thing I have. Be honest. When you scroll through the list of people who like to be called 'Friends': how many of them are really friends as in: ""I can trust them, they support me and they're here for me whenever I need it""? Found three? Delete your account, call them and meet up. Found none? Delete your account and call some people who were your friends. Found over five? Go through them again. Friends aren't made on FaceBook. They're made when they're there when you need them the most. And you will find out who are your friends when you're in need of them.<p>Currently the social media is nothing more than a way to show others how well you're doing and how great your life is. Nowhere you will read the real answer to: ""What's on your mind"" or ""What are you doing"". Sometimes there's a little glance of it, but there are not much reactions to those messages. Of course not. What should you answer. That you feel sorry for them? That you can't imagine how it must be to be in that position? It's not what FaceBook is made for.<p>If you feel the same, there's only one thing to do. Close those accounts and make your life better by calling and meeting your friends. You don't have to be that perfect person who has a perfect life. Just be honest to yourself.<p>John Murray<p>A little note:
Of course I know that social media offers the opportunity to meet new people, find old friends and make them friends. But those stories are not ""all over the place"". If you made some real friends: great. Just great. Call them now and meet them in real life. FaceBook can be the beginning. But don't let it become the end.",1334523334

3844708,comment,3844408,3844597,-2,0,TheFuture,,,"EXACTLY. This notion that gen y is some sort of elightend urban dweller is ridiculous. Gen y is the most immature gen ever in American history. They treat college like a party, an excuse to extend childish behavior, and just throw the bill on some low interest student loans. No wonder they all rent, their credit is terrible. And then they don't get that 80k job handed to them, so they still work at Starbucks at 26yrs old with a BA in pyschology or poli sci, which they took because the classes were easy.<p>I agree, its all about having kids and growing up. Once your children become your priority, your school district becomes important, and every major urban center in the USA has a school system somewhere between bad and god-awful.

I happened to throw in the counter argument that you shouldn't give direct access to your db to anyone, but your own code. (Which means you have to use an API, because you can't control what's happening on a client.) Then some DBA guy said that you have to set up the DB access rights anyway and that should be enough. But of course, if you don't use stored procedures, you can't do it fine grained enough. And these were SQL databases (!).

3844590,comment,3836978,3838090,2,0,drostie,,,"(1) You're right, I should have explained that more. I wanted to contrast this with something like ""spreadsheets today have a datum-flow model"" but a nice phrasing didn't come to me and I posted without remembering to insert the missing sentence.<p>What I mean is that spreadsheets are (right now) fundamentally based on the idea of a grid of cells which are individually meaningless and can contain anything, any individual datum, and datums may refer to each other by arbitrary operations. This grid view might be a good way to present datums to users but it requires a style convention when you want to write it to be readable; it encourages styles which obscure your ability to actually see what this sheet does.<p>It's not just that you can't <i>see</i> how the data flows, although that's part of it -- it's that the data is allowed to flow <i>in ways that you could never easily visualize in the first place</i>. Imagine that we simply draw the ""depends on"" relation by drawing a little curvy arrow from A to B if B depends on A. The Excel equivalent of ""spaghetti code"" could then literally look like spaghetti on the spreadsheet -- it would have neither head nor tail.<p>This could be solved with a nice model for how <i>data</i>, not individual datums, are allowed to flow through the application. Calculating a velocity might be as simple as writing ""(x - last(x))/(t - last(t))"", if x and t accepted vector subtractions and last(q)[i] == q[i - 1].<p>(2) I'm not entirely sure what you think the referring code is doing, if not putting the values in cells and referencing those cells. The reason why I can't be ""absolute"" about it is because in Calc (and Excel the last time I used it), to extend a computation over a vector, you highlight the computation and then click in a resizing corner to resize it into an area parallel to the input vectors -- or else you use some right-click ""Fill"" tool.<p>I used to think that these tools were broken but I think I can now appreciate that, because their model is so easily grasped, it's not really a break if it's hard to say, ""no! I wanted <i>this</i> parameter fixed.<p>(3) That sounds suspicious. mean(v) should be associated with the column v in a clear way.",1334520885

When you later meet with a potential co-founder, don't sound like you're desperately seeking the first person who knows how to fix a sinking ship.""",1334520086

But for me, the emails remain not more than 10 at any given time!<p>Why?<p>- I do get lot of emails. If i do not delete emails, I would get add more than 200 emails per day to inbox!<p>- How i do it?<p>Selective Retention, instead of Selective Deletion<p>- Open gmail
- Select all mails  === IMPORTANT ===
- iterate over the email, ""unselect"" that you need to keep
- DELETE<p>can it be more simpler?",1334520064

That being said, it would be cool to browse through the top ranked within a breed. Most people will be interested in voting non-stop, but some might just be looking for a specific breed to adopt.<p>And now that I think of it, in order to better categorize the dogs you may want to use tags. That way a dog that is mix of two different breeds would come up under both.<p>Another thought, it might be cool to get the users fill in certain ""stats"", kind of like they do on the puppybowl but being becareful not to get come across trying to be too ""cute"" (I-can-haz speak to a minimum, I don't know maybe that's just me).<p>Either way, sweet site!

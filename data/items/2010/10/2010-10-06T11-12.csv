In fact, one of the hacks on my TODO list is to statically link a Mirage application against a Linux kernel (without a userspace) to run them on the bare metal.<p>The point of defining a single address space and the smallest possible C runtime is to start from the other end: rather than stripping away 14 million lines of C code, I preferred writing a few thousand lines and jumping straight into my runtime.  It is an awful lot easier to experiment with something like <a href=""http://github.com/avsm/mirage/tree/master/runtime/xen/kernelthan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/avsm/mirage/tree/master/runtime/xen/kernel...</a> the full Linux kernel by quite a long way.  Note that the current tree isn't finished yet; I'm pulling out dietlibc entirely at the moment, so the final kernel binaries float around the ~200KB mark for a typical webserver.  Then, also consider hypervisor-only features like live migration or PV suspend/resume that can be further optimised heavily and more easily in a minios instead of Linux.  Or that Mirage is single-vCPU and event-driven only (no interrupts), and it starts to look quite different from Linux.<p>The Mirage IO library is also very portable; an application which uses only TCP/UDP (instead of the lower level Ethernet) will compile on Linux/*BSD using select/epoll/kqueue sockets to be ""just"" a high performance webserver.  The cool thing is that by using these APIs, we can also build applications that compile to small specialised operating systems, while developing them as usual on UNIX.<p>For a final entertaining hack, they are also portable enough to run directly in the browser as Javascript applications thanks to Jake Donham's ocamljs project.  We're still integrating the Websocket code in to make this properly finished, but it's a fine side experiment into portability :-)",1286365357

1763483,comment,1763111,1763313,0,0,kunley,,,"I'm happy this book inspired you into some thinking. The question is, how is it going to practically change your life in a long term?<p>I'm making this point just to strike a common misconception, not that you're certainly in it, but for anyone reading this thread. People often have an impression that buddhism is mystical, it says about all things being one and that if they got into it seriously they would be given next levels of beautiful thoughts and ideas up to the final nirvana.<p>It's not like that at all. Buddhism is practical. Deadly practical. Meaning one has to fight his own limitations first. You get some meditations and instructions from a teacher, usually tied specifically to you, and you do meditate. It changes you. Ego fights back. But if you continue the practice  you loose some previous obstacles and in general you see a new value in your relations with people, your view, in everyday things. Then another obstacles come, and so on.<p>The crucial are meditations from a teacher - it all makes sense only when you trust him. The trust must be earned somehow, it's not measurable. One of the meditations is a conscious dying meditation which I for example relearn every year. Others work best if you repeat them every day. It changes you inevitably. There's no warranty it will change you for the good, but you observe yourself. You observe the mind. It's a constant work, meant to finally relax you not tire you, though.<p>All this sweat is for understanding that everything we feel and see, including material world, is only a projection of the mind, so it's best to focus on mind itself instead of images which it mirrors. And keep this view possibly all the time.<p>Of course this view is kinda related to recent discoveries of science, esp. quantum physics and so on. But what does it mean in an everyday life? Did Einstein had a hunch buddhism is related to physics and is probably very useful? Yes. Did he follow that path? No. Did he remember in every minute of his life that things are impermanent and world is a dream? Probably not. Was he impervious to anger because of that understanding? Probably not. Some people say he was terrible person, others say he was excellent and nice. Whatever. Einstein's words may be a trampoline for someone to become interested in buddhism but he's no expert on the topic.<p>So, to really judge if it works it'd best to actually find the people who do it, or even know such people and compare how they behaved in the past and how they behave now. I know it's not easy. But Einstein, well, is dead... We're not, yet.<p>edit: Thank you HNers if you read this, these are important things and it seemed urgent to share my few cents.",1286364619

1763442,comment,1762856,1762856,0,0,sidawson,,,"I can totally relate to this. Having worked largely from home for the last decade, this is something I've had to battle a lot. Not being in an office, there's no-one else there to motivate me.<p>Here's what's worked for me:<p><i>10 under 10:</i><p>Every night I write out 10 (or more) tasks, each under 10 minutes. I make sure there's a few super easy ones (coupla minutes each) at the top of the list. That's what I work on the next day.<p>10 mins is a good length. It means you have to think down to near the deepest level of a task. I found with 20 min tasks, it's very easy to get mentally lazy, & next thing you know you're depressed/unmotivated coz something you thought would take 20 minutes is actually a day's work, full of subtle gotchyas.<p>Each day I try to do 10 of these tasks. If I achieve 10, I know I've had a good day. Thing is, once I've done a bunch of them, I'm usually motivated enough to do to a ton more. Eg, today I've done 79 (so far).<p>10 * 10=100 minutes of coding may not sound like a lot, but you'd be surprised how little actual work most people do (see: Office Space).<p>I keep two lists: the 10 under 10, and my 'done' list for the day. As I do something, I c&p it from the former to the latter. That way if I need perking up during the day, I can just look at my 'done' list to see how productive I've been.<p><i>Identifying limiting beliefs:</i><p>This is a bit trickier. It's easy to see the noise at the top level of our mind (mental chatter: ""This problem is too tough for me"" ""I can't do this"" etc). That stuff is relatively trivial to let go of (just decide to, you're the boss of your brain).<p>What's trickier is finding the subconscious stuff, doubts etc that affect our behaviour, but don't necessarily rise to the level of conscious thought. What I've found is that a lot of times things are so abhorrent that our mind ""protects"" us from them by hiding them. You can only see that you're being limited by looking at your output (behaviour, patterns, productivity etc).<p>A useful framework is this:<p>1) Assume you can do anything (as you pointed out, within this field there's no reason you can't).<p>2) From that basis, anything you're not doing is because you WON'T. Thus,<p>3) Ask yourself ""Why won't I do X?"" - with the followup question ""What am I afraid of?""<p>What I've found is for every ""won't"", there's a fear behind it.<p>Now, the super subtle thing is this: You won't necessarily get any internal (mental) answers to these questions. However, if relaxed & attentive, you may feel tension or energy rising in your body in response. This is your body's physiological connection to those deep fears. Know how when you get stressed you tense your shoulders? Yeah, it's like that.<p>So, when you feel that energy or tension rising, in response to the questions, just let it go. Make the choice to consciously relax & let go of that tension. As you do, what you're doing is simultaneously letting go of the associated belief. Keep letting go till you feel relaxed about the questions.<p>Those two techniques combined have worked wonders for me, coming from exactly the same situation you describe. Good luck!",1286363296

8616266,comment,8614689,8614689,0,0,lkrubner,,,"This is a surprising thing to see written in 1964:<p>&quot;Given the advanced state of development of present communications lines, it is unlikely that information utilities will wish to invest in their own communication networks. This may be taken as an argument against the necessity for stifling free competition and placing information utilities under public regulation; yet, there is another massive investment that the information utilities will not be able to sidestep as easily, if at all -- namely, investment in the large programming systems required to supervise the operation of the information utility and provide its services. The information utility should be able to shift part of this burden to the shoulders of its customers, but it will have to bear responsibility itself for the design, maintenance, and modification of the core of the programming system. The vast potential magnitude of this system, plus the fact that its usefulness may not extend beyond the physical machinery for which it was constructed, plus the possibility of programming waste from having too many entries in the field, may tip the balance in favor of a regulated monopoly.&quot;<p>They foresaw much of the current debate regarding the market power of cloud providers such as Amazon, and how much government regulation is needed.<p>And note that this bit was written before credit cards had become commonplace in the USA (and at a time when debit cards were wholly unknown):<p>&quot;Suppose, for example, that businesses of all sizes have simple terminals linking them electronically to a central information exchange. Then each business can make instantaneous credit checks and offer its customers the convenience of universal credit cards. These cards, referred to by some as &quot;money keys.&quot; together with the simple terminals and information exchange, can all but eliminate the need for currency, checks, cash registers, sales slips, and making change. &quot;",1416185843

In theory the logs can be truncated or deleted but the documentation is full of dire warnings against such action.&quot;<p>This belies what appears to be a fundamental ignorance of SQL Server and is not at all bizarre. If a database has been deployed in a non-simple recovery model, then the transaction log needs to be truncated as part of a backup procedure. If this isn&#x27;t the case then you should have hired a/better DBA.",1416185711
8616254,comment,8615320,8615320,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"MSSQL has some problems, some of which the post talks about. However, I tried pg out, planned to use it instead of MSSQL.<p>1. HA, via replication, clustering, etc. are all fantastic as well as easy and trivial to setup. Once PG can offer a simple little wizard and setup replication, or shared-nothing clustering with automatic fail over, awesome. Or even tx log shipping with a few clicks.<p>Instead, last I tried (9.0 I think), pg drops you off with some weird system that makes you run shell as a specific user, where you run generic sounding commands. Oh and some default config that seemingly has some bad defaults you probably should change.<p>2. Overall, MSSQL makes it easy to run a DB. I was doing a billion transactions a day (each which wrote to a few tables and also included a real ACID balance update), and I didn&#x27;t need a full time DBA or have to have particularly awesome experience beforehand. With pg, I sorta got somewhere, but I had little confidence<p>3. Development is far superior on MSSQL. Supporting other languages is a null point, because they aren&#x27;t running as part of the query execution engine. That is, there&#x27;s no real difference in using Python inside PG versus an external client, as far as I could tell. You still had to submit queries and make a transition. So TSQL seemed far nicer to work with than plpgsql. Although, the record types in pg were much nicer I&#x27;ll admit. Another annoyance: pg didn&#x27;t offer multiple returnsets in many situations. This made it awkward to run a sub function that needed to return results from different tables as separate queries. And the perf tools and UI was just so, so much better.<p>4. There&#x27;d be strange &quot;little&quot; features you&#x27;d just expect to be there, like materialized views, which pg simply does not have. Pg still lacks materialized views. The current implementation is essentially pointless, as it doesn&#x27;t update the view automatically.<p>I&#x27;m very much for PG, and believe it&#x27;s an important project and am trying to use it for future development. Much because Microsoft went back on its word that it wouldn&#x27;t move to an Oracle-style licensing where you pay for CPU power instead of just sockets. They&#x27;ve also made questionable decisions with Enterprise vs Standard, putting extra cumbersome limitations. They aren&#x27;t adding features like JSON or arrays quickly. And also, I think it&#x27;s important to run open source and try to make sure free systems stay viable.<p>But MSSQL has a lot going for it, and the ease of use and built in HA options don&#x27;t even seem like goals for PG. If licensing weren&#x27;t in the way, and I just wanted an easy system that was capable but didn&#x27;t require lots of time, MSSQL makes a strong choice.",1416185708

I think many design schools do teach some web production technologies, but designers almost never have time to specialize in production.<p>You are also exhibiting a web bias here; a lot of design work doesn&#x27;t occur for the web. Should a designer for mobile learn ObjC or Java since that is what is used to implement their designs? And god forbid the designers that work on AutoCAD; must they really learn about C++ while they are becoming experts on CAD?<p>Many IxDs that I&#x27;ve met are trained programmers and architects (though my wife is an IxD trained in visual design). Even the ex-programmers have no chance to program (our company tends to have more design work than designers, and enough programmers). I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in design quality between the ex-programmers and ex-architects (but that was mobile, not web).<p>On the other hand, I have also met some good researcher-style designers who get their hands dirty with design-oriented programming platforms like processing and arduino in their more open ended projects.

8616214,comment,8614159,8615161,0,0,robert_tweed,,,"The main point is that there are two conflicting views of what a &quot;pixel&quot; is. One is the representation of the samples and the other is what is actually displayed on-screen.<p>Take for instance a ray tracer. Each ray is a sample and these are cast from the focal point, through the view frustum, and the colour is calculated where it intersects an object in the scene. In the naive case, this is done through the precise centre of each pixel, so there is a one-to-one mapping between display pixels and rendered pixels.<p>However, that leads to very bad sampling error (aliasing), so typically you instead take lots of samples (which throws up more problems of sampling bias which I&#x27;ll ignore for now). Now you have to decide how to map those samples to screen pixels.<p>This is where the phrase &quot;a pixel is a window&quot; comes from. If the point sample falls within the current pixel boundaries, it&#x27;s a contributor to its value. Pixels are generally considered to be rectangular windows, because that maps nicely to the way they are laid out in a grid.<p>In particular, when displayed on-screen, each pixel represents a rectangular area of the screen. However, that&#x27;s independent of how the image data was quantised originally.<p>The point the paper seems to be making is that this rectangular mapping isn&#x27;t very good, and overlapping circular windows are better. That&#x27;s debatable and it depends what you&#x27;re doing. With this model some point samples are contributors to more than one screen pixel, but on the upside, contributors to each pixel are all within an equal distance from the midpoint. A square allows samples that are further away on the diagonals, which is not right. It&#x27;s correct for display, but not for manipulation.<p>Either way, a pixel is still a window. You can choose different shapes for that window, with different trade-offs, but a pixel still describes the average of samples within the region it covers, rather than any single sample. That unfortunately is then quantised into a single sample for the pixel, ostensibly at its midpoint.<p>Of course, the bigger problem is that quantisation step. If each point sample were stored as a vector, you could have lots of randomly positioned samples and re-quantize them into any shape pixels you like, which might be useful for something like the barrel-distorted projection used in the Oculus Rift, where it would be advantageous for every pixel to have a unique size and shape depending on how close it is to the centre (or think of a spherical projection where it also makes sense for pixels to be non-square).<p>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the way pixels are represented in any image formats we have, which is the particular view of pixels the paper is concerned with.",1416184891

By virtue of the universe expanding, the distance between points grows faster than the speed of light as long as those points are sufficiently far apart. This becomes more interesting when you realize that new space in between these points is being created. Sure, the galaxies traveling on this expanding medium are not actually speeding apart powered by classical movement, but they are nevertheless changing position relative to one another in an interesting way.<p>In fact, what we&#x27;re interested in when we talk about FTL is not classical movement at all - what we want is to change positions instead. There are places in nature where we know this is happening right now, for example we do know space can &quot;flow&quot; faster than the speed of light on the far side of event horizons.<p>So if we abandon the idea that we need to accelerate towards a destination, FTL becomes a broader idea of manipulating spacetime in order to be somewhere in less time than if we had actually flown there at the speed of light. There exist proposals for propulsion systems that go in this direction, for example the &quot;warp drive&quot; ideas that cheat by simply shortening the amount of space a vessel has to travel through. Some of these concepts seem to work in theory, for some definition of <i>work</i>.<p>The trouble with all these ideas is they need impractical amounts of energy. Which is wasteful, since we only need to bend spacetime for a short while and then return it to its original state behind us, something that works analogous to a catalyst would be much better.<p>At the most fundamental level though, what we are missing is a way of hacking spacetime. Huge masses and energies are how nature bends it, but ideally we would need some other way of manipulating the fabric of existence directly. This is the reason why drive systems in science fiction all have some kind of yet-unknown mystery substance critical to their function. Given how little we actually know about the basic fabric of the universe, ways of doing these manipulations may well exist. They might not. We most likely won&#x27;t find out for centuries, if ever.<p>Until then, we must answer the question so that yes, FTL is most likely possible in theory, but it&#x27;s not even remotely within our grasp right now. It might never work in practice.<p>Another observation worth considering: cosmic travel times seem utterly problematic right now because we individually live for extremely short periods of time.

I like it, even, since coming up with new items or menus was never a part of the work I particularly enjoyed. Plus, that work complicates ordering and increases the risk of food waste. Sure, I do some of that, but not much and not on a regular basis.<p>Yet there is plenty of room for creativity. I focus on trying to bring that to customer service. I&#x27;ve worked diligently to make it so that all my customers know I will do whatever I possibly can to help them, pretzel-related or otherwise. Some things are across the board, like not requiring specific lead times for orders (in this field it can be up to 48 hours). Others are customer-specific, like getting an order at 9:15AM and delivering it by 11AM (fresh-baked goods, remember), or doing dishes for three hours because I&#x27;ve got time and my customer&#x27;s dishwasher decided to no-show, or bringing a customer a giant 5-pound pretzel to help that group of people celebrate its first anniversary of being open.<p>All of that contributes to my business doing okay despite the lack of marketing on my part. People rave about the products I make, and the businesses to whom I sell are comfortable recommending me to other businesses. I mean, we all know word of mouth is the best marketing—not just for its low cost but mostly for the weight it carries—and since I’m a wholesaler my best opportunity for generating word of mouth is through customer service for the businesses buying from me. That’s an area where there’s always room for creativity since circumstances and the people involved provide diverse opportunities for me to respond well.",1416183854

8616089,comment,8614689,8615995,0,0,lkrubner,,,"In theory, automation does not ensure unemployment, but it does lower wages. In theory, so long as you have a central government that is willing to engage in enough fiscal stimulus, and a central bank that is willing to engage in enough monetary stimulus, then a society can always achieve full employment. However, automation lowers the value of unskilled labor, and certain types of automation can invalidate the value of certain types of skill, so for unskilled labor and for certain types of skills, automation lowers wages. See:<p><a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/rise-of-the-robots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/rise-of-the-robo...</a><p>&quot;If this is the wave of the future, it makes nonsense of just about all the conventional wisdom on reducing inequality. Better education won’t do much to reduce inequality if the big rewards simply go to those with the most assets. Creating an “opportunity society”, or whatever it is the likes of Paul Ryan etc. are selling this week, won’t do much if the most important asset you can have in life is, well, lots of assets inherited from your parents. And so on.<p>I think our eyes have been averted from the capital/labor dimension of inequality, for several reasons. It didn’t seem crucial back in the 1990s, and not enough people (me included!) have looked up to notice that things have changed. It has echoes of old-fashioned Marxism — which shouldn’t be a reason to ignore facts, but too often is. And it has really uncomfortable implications.&quot;<p>Also:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/krugman-sympathy-for-the-luddites.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/krugman-sympathy-f...</a><p>&quot;Mechanization eventually — that is, after a couple of generations — led to a broad rise in British living standards. But it’s far from clear whether typical workers reaped any benefits during the early stages of the Industrial Revolution; many workers were clearly hurt. And often the workers hurt most were those who had, with effort, acquired valuable skills — only to find those skills suddenly devalued.&quot;<p>Also, the typical analysis of the Industrial Revolution only looks at workers in one country, rather than studying the impact that cheap exports from England had on nations such as India or China. The reality is that a small number of rapidly industrializing nations were able to export their unemployment overseas. The devastation caused by the Industrial Revolution lasted for centuries and some countries (India) have still not recovered even now.",1416182581

In general Americans feel that of the branches of government the President represents them the most (it should really be the house and possibly the judiciary...)<p>I think further he is trying to say that the POTUS and Congress that originally published EO 12333 and some associated legislature are no longer in office today - and that this means the current branches of US law have inherited these policies and framework of legal interpretation. I think he means that undoing these traditions would be a departure from accumulated experience, investments and internal processes and thus represents a significant systemic overhall: again raising the bar of difficulty to get something passed.<p>For these reasons I think sky001 is placing the burden on the President to realign the interpretation of the law with modern storage/processing/collecting capabilities.",1416182526

3405565,comment,3404807,3404807,0,0,jiggy2011,,,"The main reasons I can see for a startup not to go .NET/MS Stack.<p>1) It is maintained exclusively by 1 company, if MS decide to kill off part of the platform or let it stagnate and you have a huge base of code based on it you are going to be missing out on the cool new stuff the ruby/python etc guys are getting. In the event that MS went bankrupt or decided to totally change their business model (i.e focus on consumer products) you are essentially screwed.<p>Also if they decide to change how their tools work (even just change the GUI around) your pretty much forced to re-learn it, this happens less on unix.<p>2) Licensing costs, sure these may not be <i>that</i> significant but they are subject to change and however small they may be you are competing with free.<p>3) Familiarity, Allot of startups probably hire recent bright college grads. These guys will have used desktop windows at some point, but they are very likely to have also installed Linux/BSD on a spare computer at some point and setup apache etc on it by reading stuff on wikis/blogs even if just for kicks. How many of them are likely to have installed a Windows 08 server on their own computer and figured out how to set it all up properly by reading MCSE manuals? It's somewhat different from setting up Windows desktop. It's also pretty complicated, I once went on a 2 week course with work to learn how to do some things on Windows server, doing roughly the same things on Linux took about 2 hours to figure out (ok , the course was pretty slow paced so 2 weeks might not be fair).<p>4) It's windows, it has a reputation for security issues. While this may not be as common as it was , it still makes allot of people nervous when I talk about forwarding ports to a Windows box.<p>5) Lock in, once you are commmited to Windows stack there's not allot you can do to chop and change parts of your stack for other things, like for example use a different kernel or filesystem. On the other hand let's say your running Linux servers and decide to move to BSD (or apache to lighthttpd), most likely much less of a hassle.<p>To overcome these things they would need some serious selling points.<p>Other than backwards compatibility with older stuff is there really a good reason that MS needs to build it's own OS kernel etc?<p>If they announced tomorrow that the next version of Windows Server would run a BSD kernel but they would port .Net + Active Directory + Windows GUI and everything else over to it would anything really be lost?",1325195933

I live in a very rural area in germany, the nearest cinemas are about 50 Kilometers and while I simply prefer watching movies on my admittedly better than average setup with decent 720p projector and very good A/V receiver and speakers, it's mostly the selection of movies those cinemas offer which keeps me away from them. I enjoy movie that are a little off the radar and those cinemas don't just have little to offer in those departments, there is simply nothing for people interested in documentaries, indie films or other movies that just don't fit into the whole blockbuster concept.<p>Of course i guess this is a different situation in urban areas where some cinemas certainly cater to interests like mine. However if there's anything to 'the Long Tail' mainstream cinemas are of course still losing audiences. These cinemas serve the purpose of showing big films for a very short period of time before they rapidly become meaningless. With the growing the popularity of on demand services like Netflix, iTunes, amazon and so on this time frame doesn't matter any longer. People can dive into special interests, classics and films that once were only catered to a niche audience and see them immediatelly. So the limited selection and the instant availability from alternative sources hurts those mainstream cinemas twice.\nThat said, the cinemas I know wouldn't see me even if I lived just across the street.",1325195571

Everything I need is within walking distance of my apartment. When my daughter goes to the playground, it is packed with other children for her to play with. There's a great library system, and there are plenty of child-friendly events to attend. From a professional standpoint, there are always meetups and events going on that are but a subway ride away.<p>I used to live in NJ and never thought I would like living in NYC, but now that I have a daughter I can't think of any other place that I'd want her to grow up in.",1325195449

I couldn't have said it better but I'll add my $0.02 anyways.<p>.NET isn't necessarily slow* to work with (GSD, not benchmark wise), but it can be very restrictive and limiting to work with.  This is probably great for ""enterprise"" (whatever that means anymore) where cutting edge technology is considered inherently risky, but in modern startup environments it's just not going to cut it.  Community involvement and maturity is part of it too, a talent pool that has a lot more myopic developers who have limited themselves to one language, one framework and one stack is another.  Windows as an environment is a third reason, it just doesn't have the same flexibility, tooling and automation of * nix environment.  Fun, as a purely subjective reason, is a fourth, I just see * nix devs having more fun with the tools they are using and the stuff they are building.<p>*though in my own experience the incredibly strict static typing of C#/Java feels slow to me. If I'm trying to design my software well so that it is extensible, understandable and maintainable I find I have far less trouble with this in Ruby, even considering that I have far more skill and experience in C#.

You know what, I actually tried to find a better term than ""governing body"" but at the end of the day, I didn't really find an alternative that wouldn't immediately get some peanut objecting to its exactness, so I went with governing body. Thankyou for being the peanut. So, international politics 101. The UN is a body whereby the nations of the planet can get together and discuss global problems and their solutions. This type of body did not exist 1500 years ago. Yes, like any reasonably well-educated adult on the planet I'm aware that the UN can't make laws, and couldn't enforce them if it did. But in the real world there are other means available to the UN to pressure member states to do the right thing. If 99% of nations voted for a new calendar, the remaining 1% are going to look pretty silly if they stay on the old calendar.<p>As for y2k, you know what, I could have stuck a load of different examples in there. Changes to http for example. Or how about the switch from national currencies to the Euro in Europe. Each one is different, but they <i>all</i> demonstrate that important changes can be made to large interconnected systems, and that the change can be activated at the flick of a switch if the need for synchronisation exists. Also, I assume you're too young to know much about y2k if you can talk so blithely about people working independently in an uncoordinated manner. Y2k was huge - if you change one system to requiring 4 digit years, but just one of the systems it communicates with requires two digit years, your system stops working. Both need to switch to 4 year dates on that interface simultaneously. When the systems you're talking about are command and control circuits, financial transfer systems etc, this was a major issue.",1325195097

If you don't want to live in another state, Brooklyn and Queens are fairly common options for tech folks who work in Manhattan.<p>Commuting from Brooklyn (which isn't technically another city) to where I work in Manhattan takes about 45 minutes. That includes the walks to and from the subway. It's a quite pleasant commute...I live far enough away that I basically always get a seat on the subway and can comfortably read on my way into work.<p>If you live closer to Manhattan, the rents go up and the commute gets shorter, but you're less likely to get a seat every morning. Standing isn't that big of a deal, but it makes it tougher to read sometimes.<p>I'd say 45 minutes each way is pretty easy. 30 minutes and under can be tougher and more expensive to pull off.<p>Walks to/from the Subway in Manhattan are typically less than 10 minutes, almost no matter where the office is. There's a lot of tech in the Union Square area, which has a ton of subway access.<p>In Brooklyn, depending on where you live, it can be a bit more of a walk to the subway, but I've never had more than a 12 minute walk and today I can do it in 5.",1325194701

However, if you dismiss any opportunity that asks you to perform a test to exhibits your skills, then your process is fraught with false positives.  Has it occurred to you that perhaps you might like the company/opportunity even though you're given an exam?  You took the time to research the company and show up.  It's too narrow at that point to give up simply b/c the interviewer wants to make sure that you truly are capable of performing the way you represent yourself on paper.<p>Further, figuring out if a developers is good is actually not that simple.

There was a longstanding market inefficiency as people tried to apply industrial/managerial thinking to software, which doesn't work. That phase appears to be coming to an end. The collapse of the barrier to starting one's own company has helped bring this about. So has the growth of hacker culture, which holds programming in high esteem and has healthier creative values than the corporate world.

It works in blocks of 64 MB (by default), and only sends data upstream when you either close a file or a full block is available to be written.

I contend that with today's reality (2.7% tech unemployment) that it is more expensive to accidentally pass on a good developer due to bad interviewing techniques than it is to hire a bad developer. A bad developer is spotted within a week on the job, a good developer can easily be passed over in an interview, it may be a long time before another good developer comes through the door.

9235146,comment,9233643,9233643,0,0,dougmccune,,,"This has been a huge topic of conversation for my wife and I for the past few years. Our entire social circle is the exact target demographic: early thirties, highly educated, career focused, etc etc. We got married earlier than nearly all our friends (age 28). We&#x27;ve had two kids before most of our friends are married. Our friends are now closing in on 35 and now thinking about how to have a family is becoming a serious concern. We were a generation raised being told consistently that a woman should be career focused, pursue as much education as possible, and that you don&#x27;t have to ever worry about finding a partner and having kids until you&#x27;re ready. And now we have friends freezing eggs, considering how to start a family without a partner while they can still easily have kids, etc. It just feels like the pendulum has swung too far in terms of my generation&#x27;s expectations (or maybe naiveté). You can&#x27;t change biology. It will be interesting to see what kind of advice I give my daughter when she&#x27;s an adult, but I&#x27;m hoping her generation has a bit more of a middle-ground approach to thinking about the balance between career and starting a family.",1426805889

Their problem, at least at the level of the leadership, is more just populism: they are telling Greeks many things that Greeks want to hear, which are mutually inconsistent. If anything the leadership lacks much of a hard ideological conviction, mixing together an eclectic combination of leftish economic sentiment with rightish nationalist sentiment, and a kind of paradoxical pro-EU/pro-euro position fitting uncomfortably with both of those. Hence there is this weird mixture of demanding German war reparations on the one hand (a completely counterproductive negotiating tactic purely for domestic nationalist consumption), trying to renegotiate the debt in a fairly technocratic/moderate way (into GDP-linked bonds) on the 2nd hand, a weirdly brash personal style on the 3rd hand which works badly with #2, a &quot;red line&quot; of no exiting the Euro on the 4th hand which restricts options considerably but is popular in Greece, and a bunch of electoral promises of the usual bread-and-wages kind on the 5th hand, which the combination of positions 1-4 leaves them virtually no room to actually enact. This all works <i>very well</i> for domestic politics, and the Syriza–ANEL coalition, a coalition of a large left-wing populist and a smaller right-wing populist party, is actually considerably more popular now than when they were elected. But it&#x27;s not clear it is a winning strategy.<p>The actual left of Syriza has become very critical internally over that line, which they see as incoherent and not in tune with reality: in their view, the line Tsipras/Varoufakis are attempting to take just won&#x27;t work, because it wants to promise staying in the Euro and then also a bunch of things that are incompatible with staying in the Euro, but won&#x27;t admit that you need to pick one. Here is one interview with a left-wing Syriza MP, criticizing them along those lines: <a href=""https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/lapavitsas-varoufakis-grexit-syriza/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/lapavitsas-varoufakis-gre...</a>. You can differ over whether this line would be better, but I think it&#x27;s more grounded in reality; Lapavitsas (the interview subject) imo much more clearly understands the concrete situation and what can and can&#x27;t be done, and doesn&#x27;t promise glibly that everything is simultaneously possible.",1426805044

So there are a lot of unhooked elements in this claim. Does it change if &quot;a company&quot; is a traditional media company (say News Corp) or a blog like Spaceflight Now? And is a &quot;PR media release&quot; the same thing as a &quot;press release&quot; (that would be a bunch of stuff a company announces and puts on a variety of distribution sources (like PR Newswire)? Does it change is the human was present and listening to the talk, or if they weren&#x27;t present and not listening to talk given?<p>Let me put that in a different context, if Obama gives a speech, and releases the speech to the media ahead of time, and a &quot;news outlet&quot; prints, or shows, or somehow makes available a &quot;story&quot; which is consumed by a reader or a viewer or a listener, was that not &quot;news&quot; that they heard? What would they call it? When you listen to the program on the radio they call that segment a &quot;news update&quot; what do <i>you</i> call it?<p>Do reporters have agendas? Sure they are reporters. Does the same &quot;news&quot; sound different coming from CNN and Fox and ABC ? Yes. And while we can all indict the media for being dupes, I expect stories that unless stories are paid placement (and neither example in this thread appears to have been a paid placement) are considered to be &quot;news stories&quot; by most people.

In most cases, you&#x27;re further advanced in your career when older, giving you more income, thereby more purchasing power. You may not find a partner, but daycare is easier to afford, or a part time nanny. Delaying childbirth most likely affords you opportunities not available to those who cut their career prospects early to have children (or who left their career entirely because they had a partner to rely on).<p>Also, more resources available to you means you can be more discerning about your partner selection.<p>> My bet is that most eggs frozen will by younger women for themselves later in life will not be used.<p>Its possible, but like I said above, its insurance.

The speed of light in a medium is the speed electronic signals travel, and the speed light waves travel.  However, electronic signals bleed interference, and light waves don&#x27;t.  You also can switch light waves on and off at theoretically higher rates, with less power, so optical signals can break the 4 GhZ barrier we are currently stuck at.<p>Secondly, they can&#x27;t bend light without loss.  Just with less loss.  But the interesting part of the paper is the fact that the turning is selective depending on polarization (one polarization turns, and one doesn&#x27;t).  They are also able to turn light very quickly, compared to the wavelength of the light.  So the radius of curvature divided by the wavelength of the light is around 6.4 for this paper.",1426803345

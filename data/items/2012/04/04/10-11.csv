Because he used AJAX for every error, it creates a (unnecessary) strain on the network/server when in production. Besides this, the usefulness of the data logged may vary heavily. Therefore I suggest you do not log everything, like chrisacky points out. What exactly to log is an interesting resulting question.<p>I do fancy the idea of logging problems client-side, because they result in users leaving your site but leaving you without a clue what happened.",1333537186
3796989,comment,3793183,3796121,2,0,luriel,,,"I was referring to a 'standard' program using the language's corresponding stdlib. And while not as useful this days C's ""stdlib"" is incredibly thick and complex. Go's stdlib is probably comparable to Plan 9's basic C libraries in complexity, but is portable and provides much more functionality.<p>Also note that Go can do all the things you mention, including writing a kernel.<p>Just to be clear, the real issue with C is not the language so much as the horrible libraries that have been built over decades of clumsily piling up complexity.<p>And the people who suggest glib is the answer to C's library needs are scary and depressing, glib just adds another layer of (very unportable!) crud on top of libc for no real gain other than keeping people from learning how to properly write C (data structures in particular).",1333537178

3796983,comment,3791545,3793815,1,0,DanBC,,,"Ah, yes, I was suggesting that criminalising prostitution is a good idea.<p>In general I don't have a problem with people selling or buying sex.  There are some people who need strong protections - anyone under age; anyone who's being coerced; anyone who's being trafficked.  There could probably be strong laws made around those areas, with extra help and support for victims.<p>Then there's a bunch of public health stuff.  People addicted to drugs; people with STDs; people engaging in risky ('bareback') behaviour; and so on.  Education and support would be good for these.  Unfortunately drug addicted sex workers are not a sympathetic vote winning crowd.<p>The law in the UK is a bit odd.  Exchanging money for sex is okay, but you're not allowed to offer sex for money or to offer money for sex.  And then there are some newer laws which are ""strict liability offences"" (it doesn't matter if you know or not; even if you made efforts to find out) covering women who are forced into sex working.  (This covers drug addicts paying debts for drugs using sex work.)<p>The UK has a stricter definition of trafficked than the UN.  A person can voluntarily be trafficked into the UK.",1333536860

3796971,comment,3796869,3796869,4,0,chrisacky,,,"Theory correct. Implementation wrong.<p>If I was actually doing this and wanted to run it on a production site, I would certainly not fire off a post on each error. The most likely solution that I would use off the top of my head would be to store the data in localStorage of the current user where supported.<p>You wouldn't need to collect <i>every</i> <i>single</i> <i>error</i>, but just a sample. You shouldn't really need to be that concerned with the totally extreme edge cases, and if you are triaging correctly then it's the most common errors that you want to look out for.<p>So I would implement something that would result in a random selection of my visitors from collecting the errors for me and also have a buffer and client side rate limit included into the application so that errors are saved up, and sent in bulk.<p>As I start collecting errors which I realise are totally beyond my control, I would then start dropping errors generated from particular files and extensions installed and stop logging them.<p>Logging <i>everything</i> is wrong in my opinion.<p>Edit:<p>Yes I would do the <i>bulk</i> of deciding what to log on the server. However, I think I would still have some standard rules that I know I can apply to disregard certain error events. But since I would constantly be working over the logs, the majority would be done server side.",1333536543

Write to it, then you could just have a consumer that takes the output of that process and writes it to an imposed directory structure in SQLite blobs in a data store that the parent also owns. You'd lose some key functionality unless you chunked the data a bit. And, you know, mmap() would be impossible to simulate, but nobody ever promised a reliable implementation of that.<p>It confuses me, because I've seen a handful of these worries expressed, and it seems like a bunch of traditional UNIX-y methods for dealing with these kinds of problems are still open. I don't know what all the rules are, because I haven't really seriously looked at it, but I can think of at least three old UNIX tricks off the top of my head that probably solve this concern acceptably for 80% of apps that have it - you could use named pipes; you could redirect output to a third process like netcat that connects back to a handler process via a domain socket and deals with it; the parent could open a shm segment and maintain a DMA-like sweeper that takes blocks off, puts them into files it owns, and keeps its own little virtual FS.<p>I know none of those is straight fopen(), but somebody would only have to write it one time. Seems like a classic my-current-filesystem-is-mounted-ro problem. That used to be a pretty everyday occurrence, and any old sys admin has 100 workarounds for it.<p>And remember before you squawk about chunked byte streams being inserted into blobs: there's 15 years of Oracle Video Server delivering PPV porn to the hotelier masses that says it works fine.",1333534862

For example, anonymouse.org offers a simple form for AnonEmail, as does the sendanonymousemail.net website. There's also Mailinator, which provides free disposable email addresses, and Hushmail, which works like an ordinary email service but encrypts all your email.</i><p>That ""and/or"" in the first line is important.  They should have been clearer because, as they acknowledge, many people just don't get this stuff.  (Also, Hushmail (and I guess all services) say they comply with correctly formed legal requests.  Hushmail will go as far as crafting a backdoored java app and serving it to the customer.  I guess that's not particularly worrying for regular users from England.)<p>Public key encryption is hard with anonymity because you tie an identity (the keys) to messages.<p>The other problem is the risk analysis you have to do.  Protecting email content and routing data is trivial if the attacker is ""the smart 14 year old"" or ""the very smart, experienced 45 year old with industry connections"".  But in this case the attacker is a well funded, first world, technically advanced government.  GCHQ are not idiots.  They don't lack computer power or math expertise.

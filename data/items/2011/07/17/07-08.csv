The hatred of each other has become so deep rooted in both the countries and the mutual suspicion so strong that it is too late that the relationship can be changed. But we still owe it our next generation to work towards peace so that the wealth that belongs to them does not get spent in keeping up the needless hostility. We cannot let the past ruin the lives of the poorest people in the world who live in this region.\nIt is time for the Pakistani people to call a spade a spade. They cannot take refuge anymore in the filmsy excuses and their needless obsession with Kashmir anymore. If they don't do anything now and continue to behave as they have done till now for the last 60 years, it will be too late. Pakistan as a nation is literally on its last breath and it needs an immediate shock treatment by its own people if it wants to survive. India will continue to grow and survive but it is Pakistan whose survival at stake.

So social does work sometimes. :-)<p>I agree with his statement that SM should start with an experiment, many of them really.  Developing strategies that require viral cascades is a recipe for failure.<p>social media is engagement in my view. many small engagements are like small fires.  It is unclear which one will catch.  Which message will resonate with our audience.  However, if it does, then investing further energy, getting the fire to shift and turn into something larger is possible.<p>He is right that most agencies can not do this.  Nor do clients see much value in small multiple experiments across mediums (sites, technologies, platforms). Some see this as a risk.  few see it as an opportunity.  The difficulty is shifting resources and being able to kill off projects that have little current value.  Most projects in large agencies are priced and resources allocated (most outsourced)long before the project beings; which means agility is lost while risk is managed.<p>This is actually the benefit of a startup. Being able to track real time metrics, actually creating value and engaging in that creation with their users/buyers/clients shifting resources as needed.<p>I think the Ted talk about the Why, How, What circles explains very clearly why some campaigns are successful and why most fail.  If you are starting at What, you will fail most of the time. If you start from the Why of your product, community, the philosophy and thoughts and beliefs behind it, there is a chance that it will be far more appealing.<p>That some believe Social Marketing does work and does not work only clarifies that our strategies are poor.  Not all TV commercials are culture shaping, nor do all magazine ads shape society, but to assume that they have no impact is a large mistake.<p>Social marketing works.

2772760,comment,2772377,2772615,5,0,braindead_in,,,"To know why Indian Muslims have been left out you have to go into the colonial history of India. It all started with the 1857 rebellion, The Sepoy Mutiny. The rebellion was primarily started by the Muslims soldiers with support from Hindus. After the rebellion was quelled the Britishers ostracized the Muslims and the Hindus were given preferential treatment. All the best Civil Service jobs, the licenses, etc. went to Hindus. Hindus had better access to education compared to Muslims. After independence the bureaucracy continued this discrimination. (As an aside, this was one of the reasons why Muslims flourished in Arts; Bollywood being a good example).<p>The trend however has largely been reversed because of vote bank politics. The political parties today are trying to woo the Muslims (and Dalits) as best as they can. The ruling political party, Congress is viewed as pro-Muslim. The Economic liberalization has also opened up the possibilities for Indian Muslims. The corporations do not discriminate when it comes to a customer. Indian Muslims have the same access to loans and credit as the Hindus (and all other religious groups). Schools don't care about religion as long as somebody can cover the tuition fees. As an anecdote, in Bangalore majority of auto-rickshaw (three wheeler transport) drivers are uneducated Muslims. But their kids all go to English medium schools, not Madrassas.<p>Rural India however is still divided along communal and caste lines. Caste and religion play a huge social and economic part of the rural fabric and change there is slow. But the Muslims there are as discriminated against as the Dalits, if not more.",1310887228

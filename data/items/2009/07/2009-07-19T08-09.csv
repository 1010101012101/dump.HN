I recently discoverd that my solutions started to be too complete, too much complexity analysis, too much enduser friendlyness.
And that a 10 line POS script could do the same, if only the users would know how to code.",1247993842

712767,comment,712287,712287,0,0,dctoedt,,,"In computer terms:  the CPU(s) and RAM of humans -- the wetware, if you will -- are presumably much the same, on average, as they were 100 years ago.<p>But it seems indisputable that we know how to deal effectively with more of life's threats and opportunities than we did back then.<p>(Again in computer terms, our libraries of event-detection and -handling routines are much more sophisticated than those of a century ago.)<p>As a simple example, just think of how much more more the average person knows about, say, healthy eating and the downside of smoking -- this isn't to say, of course, that there isn't still a lot of work to do in disseminating that knowledge.<p>So yeah, there seems little question that we are indeed 'smarter' (in the sense used above) than we were 100 years ago.",1247993665

Advanced topics will feel so much easier.<p>For that I can recommend Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by Kenneth H.

712765,comment,712447,712447,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Working on a laptop to me feels like trying to paint my hallway through the keyhole.<p>There is so much going on when writing software that even with two monitors I feel pretty cramped, as soon as I switch to a laptop I'm lost.<p>There was a time when I could do dev work on a laptop. No IDE required, no browser required (for testing or to look up documentation), just a text editor in a shell window. That time is now probably more than 5 years in the past and the more I'm doing this the more screen real estate I feel I need.<p>The other day I was wondering how hard it would be to connect four monitors instead of just 2 and how I would place them on my desk to get any kind of improvement over the current situation (with windows overlapped at least 3 deep on each monitor).",1247993333

It's refreshing to have someone be honest enough with you to tell you something you may not want to hear, but you really need to hear.",1247991996

(in total roughly 1M uniques / day on all the sites that I'm involved with).<p>The larger the site the <i>lower</i> the CPM in my case, and that is significantly lower. Bulk traffic seems to get lower CPMs than niche sites, the smaller sites make as much as $5 and the larger ones are way down, some all the way down to $0.12.<p>What sites do you see this opposite effect on ?",1247991987

712750,comment,712350,712402,0,0,jf,,,"In 2004 I moved to a city where my AT&T TDMA phone was permanently roaming. I didn't pay roaming charges because my plan with AT&T covered my roaming charges.<p>Months later, AT&T set up a single TDMA tower in my area. Because AT&T phones were service provider locked, my phone and hundreds of others like it were forced to use that single tower. Overnight my phone went from having perfect signal everywhere I went, to just short of useless.<p>Every single AT&T representative that I talked to swore up and down that the reason I was getting poor service was not their fault, that the problem was with my phone and that I should get a new phone.<p>Since this happened just as AT&T was moving from TDMA to GSM, I am guessing that this was their way of forcing their customers to move to GSM. I can understand the business case for moving customers to GSM, what I can't understand is why AT&T would do so by using trickery and lies.<p>I will always remember AT&T's shady tactics and blatant deceit and will never give them another cent of my money - I will purchase an iPhone the second it is officially available on another provider.",1247991713

712745,comment,712487,712487,0,0,yason,,,"Aside from some special-interest forums, I've ended up reading just HN.<p>(Warm thanks to you guys for being my filtering function.)<p>One by one, I dropped following various news sites from my Mozilla toolbar. I must say I never really bought into the RSS boom as the best sites I read were pretty simple and looked much like a beautified RSS layout.<p>First went Slashdot. This was years ago, about the time Reddit started. Reddit lost it last year: too congested with useless links with a low signal to noise ratio. I've been dropping many of my national news sites, too -- tech news and otherwise -- leaving only those of best quality. Then I dropped them as well because nothing much in the mainstream doesn't really interest me. This was a big thing I had to accept. I really don't have to know the details of some crisis that is 5000km away no matter how civilized or educated that may be considered; if I start hearing about a major change in the given situation only then I'll look up for some more news.<p>Last spring I dropped reading the website of the main newspaper in Finland. The news were mostly uninteresting except maybe for some local things. I still check their news listing maybe once a week but I rarely read any news items. I realized that I'll hear about anything important from other people anyway. So I'm effectively using my friends and co-workers as a live filter.<p>TV and TV news I dropped 10 years ago.<p>So HN it is. Then, plus a few web forums / mailinglists but those provide a mix of both information and connections to people. People are usually more interesting than the latest ""facts"" of random subjects.",1247991240

712741,comment,712642,712674,0,0,alxv,,,"> I would also suggest picking up a Number Theory or Combinatorics text; they're practically useless<p>Useless? I dear to say that number theory is currently the most lucrative field of mathematics. Without number theory, modern day cryptography would not exist and thus everything that depends on secure communication of information would not exist. So forget about commerce over the Internet, bank wire transfers, credit cards, administrating computers remotely and, most importantly, hiding your huge porn collection from your wife.<p>And, combinatorics is useful for the study of algorithms. It is pretty much the foundation of computer science.",1247990562

8478248,comment,8477659,8477659,0,0,perlpimp,,,"I am not sure why debian needs to force replace sysvinit, can&#x27;t they have systemd-debian distro that will have all the shiny stuff in it? and maybe have it grow and if it won&#x27;t go down with their userbase then they can discontinue it? Everyone moving to systemd seems a bit fishy. C is very insecure for daemon coding with all other options why no use go for example? There might be some influence on behalf interested governmental parties giving a push to systemd. I don&#x27;t have a problem with systemd its just I think it should have been an option not a default for server setups.\nC programs if they are not really carefully coded can be easily hacked by stack smashers, race condition inducers etc.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwcl17Q0bpk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwcl17Q0bpk</a>",1413727100

It was huge fun.<p>After only one month, I signed up for their 5-lessons-a-week plan.  I get up at 6 a.m. every day to converse with my teacher in China via Skype.<p>I would definitely suggest one-on-one lessons, as I&#x27;m doing it.  I get maximum reading and discussion time, and the conversation always starts with a description of what I&#x27;ve done over the last day (or over the weekend).  So I&#x27;m learning all sorts of words (e.g., &quot;clients&quot;) that I wouldn&#x27;t get from a regular class.<p>I also know some Spanish and Hebrew.

So it&#x27;s basically using a game engine without even game engine decent lighting / shading for the most part.<p>So while it&#x27;s great for placing objects in the scene and getting the camera position correct, that&#x27;s about it. There has been a move to using progressive raytracing more and more over the past year or so, but it&#x27;s still very early days with that.<p>On top of that, as previs is almost always done early (before most asset generation - modelling, texturing, maybe animation too) is done, it doesn&#x27;t always give you all the info you need - i.e. it&#x27;s often the case with mechanical hero objects in the scene (i.e. aircraft, robots, weapons, etc) that the basic geometry used for previs isn&#x27;t good enough, and later on in real lookdev/lighting (or sometimes even at animation stage) serious issues are found - i.e. the previs has a robot moving through a street, but when animation actually start trying to rig the robot to get it moving realistically, they find for the arms to swing, it can&#x27;t actually <i>fit</i> in the street.<p>So there&#x27;s a huge amount of iteration that works up-and-down the pipeline, sometimes causing lots of different parts of it to re-do work.<p>Generally it goes:\nPrevis -> Modelling / Texturing (linked, as you need UVs) -> Layout -> Animation - > Lookdev / Lighting -> Compositing.<p>Any non-trivial change before Lookdev / Lighting will trigger new renders having to be done for some layers / scenes.",1413725582

There is no sexism[pron] but simply &quot;sexism&quot;[1].<p>There is no rhetorical fallacy here, but the mere misuse of the term sexism by you, and it really doesn&#x27;t matter how many people make that mistake. While you bring up murder and puppies as an example, you are simply mistaken in the meaning of the word sexism. You make an analogy to murder -- which implies intent -- while a more proper analogy is killing -- which does not. Killing is bad even if the deaths lack malice. Murder is worse than killing, but only when judgement is concerned. If killing is widespread (as sexism is), people care about stopping it more than passing judgement. The problem with sexism is, that unlike killing, those who are not its victims (and sometimes even its victims) are blind to it (although, to be sure, pointing out sexism often feels like judgment -- just as accusation in indirect killing does).<p>The articles you linked to are irrelevant -- when I say &quot;sexism&quot;, I simply mean sexism (which I&#x27;ve even defined), while you insist on a wrong meaning of a word simply because you feel like it. There is little point in arguing about that.<p>> I do hope to prevent you from imposing your will on those women who behave in ways you disagree with.<p>Ah, this is where things become interesting, and because people here like their science fiction, let&#x27;s talk sci-fi. Did the people living in the Matrix choose to live there or didn&#x27;t know other possibilities existed? Was there liberation coerced or their subjugation, even though the former was quite inconvenience while the latter was as tranquil as slipping into a coma?<p>If society, over millennia, imbues people with an idea that benefits some and harms others, so much so that the oppressed can&#x27;t see their oppression, isn&#x27;t it the moral duty of those who can see outside the matrix to point it out, even if this entails some discomfort? How free is someones choice, if they&#x27;ve been raised to make it? You should know that even during slavery in the US, many slavery supporters claimed that at least some slaves liked their position in society -- which makes sense because they weren&#x27;t exposed to a different reality.<p>Now, you should realize that this isn&#x27;t rhetoric but quite the opposite. It is rhetoric that keeps most of us blind to reality. Once you start seeing how power structures in society work, that they ensure that the powerful stay in power -- even without any conscious, sinister conspiracy behind them, but a constant drip of ideas -- you&#x27;ll feel like physicians must have felt when germs where discovered, and the true nature of many illnesses was finally truly seen.<p>The reason why feminism is so often concerned with words and rhetoric is precisely this. Being forced to actively thing about something so seemingly &quot;natural&quot; as language is a good mechanism of curing our blindness. If you live in the matrix, to see it you must question <i>everything</i> -- the more &quot;innocuous&quot; the better. It&#x27;s so prevalent that it&#x27;s hard to spot unless you try very hard.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism</a>",1413725268

When trying to type at 160WPM+ it matters far less what kind of sound or tactile feel the keys produce as you care more about the key actuating immediately when hit and providing some spring action to help the finger back up afterward. A leaf-mounted keycap has essentially no sliding friction, which means very little difference in force required between hitting it obliquely or perpendicularly.<p>Isn&#x27;t buying a premade MCU board for a &quot;keyboard from scratch&quot; cheating a little? I&#x27;d go with a deadbugged 8749 in a DIP-40 package, the classic MCU for a keyboard controller. :-)",1413724347

An onerous documentation change/approval management scheme. Covering up a mistake. A culture that causes people to fear losing their jobs, especially for cost reasons, or the feeling that company management are looking for reasons to cut staff. Having your group be blamed for an expensive product recall makes you an easy target. One of the last things a middle-aged engineer in the US auto industry wants to be right now is laid-off.<p>We naively expect a senior engineer to do the ethically correct thing without respect to whether it has negative personal consequences. The problem with this idea is that the consequences for being &quot;that guy&quot; are too great; and both engineering societies and state licensing boards have been derelict in their roles of helping to protect engineers who refuse to do the ethically gray/wrong.<p>>I interpret it as the deadline being a root cause. At the heart of any complex issue lies one or more root cause(s).<p>There are so many things wrong with product engineering management, but yeah laying a deadline that no engineer has the courage to break would definitely be one of them.",1413724340

You will thank yourself later. Also note: you will burn yourself many times throughout the build. Might as well do it with a fancy iron!\n    LEADED SOLDER – I started the build without leaded solder and oh dear…\n</code></pre>\nIf you have a &quot;decent soldering iron&quot;, then lead-free solder shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Also, if you live in the EU, leaded solder will be extremely difficult to come by.<p>Well, even with a really crappy iron, as long as the tip is fresh, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. Most people&#x27;s problems with soldering come from not having the tip wet enough and not using enough solder, thereby not making enough contact with the wire and not putting heat into it fast enough to get that specific location hot before the heat conducts away into the rest of the wire.<p>Remember, the entire reason we&#x27;re using the wire is because it&#x27;s an excellent conductor. For that reason, thicker gauge wire is also going to be more difficult to work. And the only reason to use larger gauges of wire is to support more current. Keyboards run on extremely little current already. You probably could have done this with magnet wire and been fine (though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, magnet wire is difficult to work for different reasons).<p>So crank up the heat. Get it into the wire as fast as possible. Lead-free solder generally needs higher heat than leaded solder anyway. Apply the solder, apply the wire, then wait a second before removing the iron, because you also have to heat the wire you&#x27;re pushing in. Soldering is a chemical bond, the metals physically mix, and you need to get them up to the right heat to do that.<p>And keep it steady, any movement while it is cooling will create microfractures in the solder joint.",1413723681

The smaller guy might be better suited for some other task.<p>It is just that the brain seems to be a fairly universal tool, we don't really know aspects equivalent to being tall or small that would apply to the brain yet, or do we? It rather seems that parts of the brain are exchangeable, as could be seen from the blind guy who learned to see things with his tongue (machine would translate images to impressions on the tongue). So what would be the problem of less intelligent brains? Synapses working slightly slower? Less neurons - but why can't you grow them by training (like muscles)? Or what?<p>On the other hand, clearly intelligence is 100% genetic: no matter how much you nurture a pig, it will never go to harvard.",1192707015

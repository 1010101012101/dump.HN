They've gotten lazy and think that designing flexible layouts that work on multiple screen resolutions is a challenge that they shouldn't have to solve.<p>Don't get me wrong fragmentation of versions & hardware is making some tasks difficult for Android devs but I feel like some devs are regressing in their mentality towards software challenges thanks to iOS.",1332745196

3755435,comment,3755286,3755286,6,0,pooriaazimi,,,"Android is fragmented, not just because Android devices have different screen sizes and resolutions, but also because they have different input methods as well (some are fully multi-touch, some have back/home button, some have QWERTY keyboard, some have stylus, ...) AND are usually a couple versions behind (just 1.2% of Android devices run 5-month-old 4.0, compared to about 60% of iOS devices that run 4-month-old 5.0[1]). I guess a huge portion of OS X users are on Lion or Snow Leopard (if I had to throw a number out of my hat I'd say 45% on SL and 35% on Lion; but the important thing is that every new Mac sold in the past 6 months came with Lion, not Android 3.2!).<p>And back to the <i>screen size</i> fragmentation point he's trying to make, I think it's really not as severe on desktop as it is on mobile devices - if you fine-tune a FULL SCREEN mobile app for a 4.1-inch display, it wouldn't fit well in a 4.6- or 3.5-inch display, and will look like garbage. But if you fine-tune an app for an 11"" MacBook Air display, it's still reasonably tolerable on a 13"" MBP.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2012/03/23/developer-sees-quick-adoption-of-ios-5-1-amongst-users/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macrumors.com/2012/03/23/developer-sees-quick-ado...</a>",1332745116

3755410,comment,3755286,3755286,1,0,chao-,,,"I chuckled when the point dawned on me, albeit a bit later than it should have. But the comparison breaks down when you consider the different ways Desktop OSes and Mobile OSes handle the relationship between display resolution and application resolution.<p>That is to say: we have come to expect (or have been required to accept?) that mobile applications operate on a full-screen basis only. This is logical for tiny screens, but causes problems when the definition of 'space' differs in the phrase ""Use ALL the space!"" This is not the case for desktops.<p>In Desktoplandia, we operate in a windowed (or tiling) environment that allows application resolution to be less-than-or-equal-to the display resolution. Some applications may choose to require a full-screen approach, but that is their choice. Other applications may actually place a maximum size on a given window, or not allow resizing at all! Hopefully the developers chose to limit their app for a good reason, but that flexibility is open to them. And while obviously a ""maxes out at 800x600"" application might be under-utilizing a 1920x1080 monitor, the environment is one wherein we have come to accept that this will happen from time to time. Furthermore, when it does happen, it's not always a loss in the usefulness or experience provided by the application.<p>So while the post succeeds at lampooning the dismay of mobile developers for a moment, I don't feel it fully captures the difficulty in being forced into an ever-changing, forced-upon-you full screen mode in an environment where people are less accepting of a ""Well my app just happens to run smaller on your huge screen"" approach.",1332744610

3755339,comment,3755080,3755080,5,0,cheald,,,"I've been echoing this for a while. The iPad is a <i>stellar</i> content consumption device. If you just want to read email and watch YouTube and see pictures of the grandkids, the iPad is a fully-functional computing device, insofar as you need one.<p>It is a truly abysmal creation device, though. Typing on it is slower than on a physical keyboard. You can't switch between apps very easily, so doing anything where you'd have to reference or copy information is greatly hindered. If you want to use ""non-visible"" keystrokes (like control or win/cmd), it's a non-starter. The OS is heavily locked down and so divorced from the concept of ""processes"" and ""files"" that it is designed to not simply hide the internals, but to actively deny that they exist. While it's possible to create with it, it's absolutely the wrong tool for it. The hacker ethos is adamant about using the right tools for the job. Using the iPad as a creation platform (with, perhaps, the sole exception of a finger-painting device) is akin to using a pair of scissors like a bandsaw. You can get it done, maybe, after a lot of work and a lot of pain, but it's the wrong tool for the job.<p>I really appreciate how usable the iPad is as a device for people who simply want to consume content. But, I think that to treat it as the ""next generation of computing"" (see also: the ""post-PC era"") does a tremendous disservice to our industry, our children, and our society as a whole. Breeding out curiosity and penalizing the tinkerer is not a good thing. I am a programmer because my computer is my artist's canvas - code is the medium with which I paint. It is a deeply creative, deeply engaging, deeply expressive device for me. The iPad is not - and by design, cannot be.<p>It's a fantastic device for consuming content, but if you're going to sign up with the iPad, you're going to have to sign up to the consumer-oriented culture it is infused with. That'll be $0.99. Please don't peek behind the curtain.<p>Edit: Because I'm sure it'll be brought up, don't confuse creating content <i>for</i> the iPad (with your full-fledged Mac computer) with creating content <i>on</i> the iPad. The former is, of course, happening all the time, and that's great. But unless you're buying the device plus the $99 developer's license to be able to program it, you're not buying a ""production"" device.",1332743238

One good thing about a list of textbooks is that it shows just where market opportunities exists for potential authors, and also where the bar is already set high.  I have observed perfectly authoritative books being ""replaced"" for no good reason.  This may be encouraged by publishing companies due to the way copyright works.

I thoroughly enjoyed these books.<p>The other books on the ""have read"" list are on my ""don't bother reading"" list. Code Complete, Pragmatic Programmer, Mythical Man Month et al aren't my kind of books. As far as design patterns go, I believe if you code in Python/Ruby/Perl etc, books covering them in Java/C++ are needlessly verbose and boring. I recommend Alex Martelli's talks<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vJJlVBVTFg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vJJlVBVTFg</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Sbzmz1Nxvo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Sbzmz1Nxvo</a><p>And this book which covers design patterns using Ruby.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Ruby-Russ-Olsen/dp/0321490452"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Ruby-Russ-Olsen/dp/032...</a><p>Both approaches actually show you practical examples of design patterns in the standard library or real world problems, and shuns patterns which aren't applicable to the language or are too trivial. These talks aren't the end-all, but they will give you a good overall knowledge, and will make further exploration easy.<p>And from the ""haven't read"" list, CLRS is a good book and isn't as dense as it is generally taken to be. It does have sections on proofs, but you can skip it and jump directly to the data structure/algorithm. The pseudo code used in the book is extremely clear, and will convert to simple python in most of the cases. Use it as a reference, or read first few hundred pages. If the book isn't for you, you will know it after you have read the first 100 pages.<p>Another book I recommend is Sedgewick's book on Algorithms. I have read the C version. It mostly covers basic data structures and some accompanying algorithms. The code is succinct(sometimes needlessly so) and more importantly,  it works. It doesn't sit well with everyone, but I liked it - it helps me see the whole picture without bombarding me with a lot of code.<p>Skiena is another obvious favorite.<p>Dragon book is decent, but you need guidance and discipline to make anything out of it. Consult your peers or teachers while using the book, or use another book.<p>I haven't read TAOCP and it's low on my list for now. I have read bits and pieces and I didn't find it as fascinating as I had hoped. It's dense and extensive, and can be used as reference.<p>""Effective C++"" will be a better alternative to ""The C++ programming language"". But I must say, when I first read ""The C++ programming language"", I found it fascinating - lengthy, but fascinating. That would be mainly because I was beginning programming when I first read it.",1332742932

The USSD interface works like this:<p>1. Dial *888#  \n2. A prompt appears on your mobile phone. The prompts could be a menu, a request for a password or whatever  \n3. The user clicks reply (a context menu appears on the phone) and types in a reply.  \n4. Go to no. 2 until the transaction is complete.<p>Zaad has exploded in growth in the 2 or 3 years it's been around and has freaked out a lot of other businesses here who suddenly got a scary new popular competitor. The best part of Zaad is that you don't need a smartphone or internet connectivity to use it. Literally any mobile phone works with it. Even an old-school Nokia 3310.<p>Telesom isn't the first country to come up with this idea. If I'm not mistaken, the first company was a Kenyan company called Safaricom and their product is called M-Pesa. It has 6 million subscribers using it.<p>Imagine 6 million folks sending transactions and getting a tiny cut out of every transaction. M-Pesa is huge.",1332742392

If I am working longer than that and have nothing I can publicly show then the scope has probably buried me and nothing will ever be released.<p>2) Say F<i></i>k it and <i>quietly</i> release the project. Quietly because it isn't 100% finished. There are little problems here and there. I would like to spend weeks tweaking a feature but if I do it without releasing anything I will get bored and start a new idea. Once released I can iterate, improve and add functionality.<p>3) Tell everyone what I working on as I am doing it. This means I need something to show at the end of it or I will look silly. I then tell people in order of technical expertise about its release. Tech savvy people understand the concept of a beta and even an alpha. Others... not so much.<p>So far its working.

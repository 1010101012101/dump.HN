You can use it to run a job, host a webserver or any other scenario that you can think of. What makes Docker (rather containers) different from a VM is the way it sandboxes all your application&#x27;s dependencies into an isolated sandbox.<p>So let&#x27;s say you have a python app that for relies on a dependency that needs C bindings (e.g. ImageMagick). Instead of running `./app.py` freshly downloaded from some Git <repo>, you would run `docker run <repo> ./app.py`. In the former case, you would need to care of, say, the C dependencies. In the second case, they are packaged in the image that Docker will download from <repo> prior to run the ./app.py process in it. (Note that the two <repo> are not the same things. One is a Git repo, the other is a Docker repo - called an Image.)<p>Think of process of the building a container as taking a snapshot of the entire OS (such as VM images) but w/o the high overhead of running these images.<p>Feel free to reach out to me if you need more clarification!",1452667826

I&#x27;d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders,&quot; Michael Dell said before a crowd of several thousand IT executives.<p>Dell&#x27;s comments follow Steve Jobs&#x27;s keynote address at the Seybold trade show last week in San Francisco, where the Apple cofounder seemed to win over attendees with his explanation of why he had made certain key decisions, killing the clone market and aligning more closely with Microsoft. The Seybold crowd--as well as some Apple employees--also seemed to be buoyed by the increasing role Jobs has taken on at the company as board member and interim CEO.<p>But others, like Dell, appear to think that Jobs&#x27;s expanded role isn&#x27;t helping. There is some concern that Apple will have a hard time recruiting a top-notch CEO because of Jobs&#x27;s presence.<p>Others fear that Apple could end up completely in Microsoft&#x27;s camp by deciding to use the NT operating system on its servers. Apple is reportedly planning to come out with network computers that would require high-end servers to function.<p>While many industry executives have offered opinions on how to right Apple&#x27;s ship, no high-level executive has made as blatant a comment as Dell&#x27;s.",1452665775

If that is the problem, I will happily walk the student through the setup--even at any point in the semester.  If a computer craps out, <i>I</i> will help the student recover from the repository--I don&#x27;t expect them to be able to do that.  It does also happen, rarely, that I have to actually help a student set up their computer because they have some weird issue.  I do not consider failing at setting up your environment to be a failure of the class.  Schedule some time with me and we&#x27;ll go through it together.<p><i>HOWEVER</i>, this is generally not the problem, oddly.  They get that set up pretty much fine.<p>The first problem is: System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);<p>I <i>WARN</i> people over and over.  I am automated testing this.  Computer output must be <i>EXACT</i>.  The comma, space, capitalization, and exclamation point <i>ARE NOT OPTIONAL</i>.  Debugging is about noticing details, and if you can&#x27;t match this, you&#x27;re not going to find the actually subtle bugs later in your own code.  Really, this is the only functional line in the program--I&#x27;m not joking about this.<p>The second problem is: &quot;But I didn&#x27;t know I could check this before the assignment date.&quot;  Um, I have a website set up for the class--did you check it for the past two weeks that it has been running?  I have pointed this page out and put it on screen at both beginning and end of class for the past 4 lectures.  The anonymized login ID&#x27;s have a Red X for a failure and a Green + for success.  I also have the intensity modulated properly so that those who are red/green color blind are able to tell as well.<p>I have just learned that I&#x27;m going to have to politely smile at all the excuses and whining after that first assignment and tell people repeatedly that I&#x27;m not budging on this.

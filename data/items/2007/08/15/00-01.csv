If an article will be raised up by two or more points by a person with bigger voting power will its submitter get an adequate karma raise? Is there a limit? Is there a bonus for the up-voter? Do you take into consideration current karma? Does voting power apply to down voting (I assume it does)?<p>I think there will be a temporary higher amount of voters on the New queue, seeking for a bigger voting power, which is a good thing because the good stories will get to the main site faster. Maybe it won't be temporary as newcommers will strive for power and the easiest/only way is voting the good stories soon.<p>However, consider this situation: A speculator comes around, voting up at random (thinking ""someone will have to raise this one up"") and then another one appers, seeing that a story already has 2,3 or 4 points, he could raise it up to just because it will earn him a better voting power... Will the system be able to deal with this (altough I'm not really sure this is a real threat)?\n",1187139372

42505,comment,42398,42491,0,0,portLAN,,,"> Could one atom in a quantum computer be used to simulate more than one ""virtual"" atom at a time?<p>That's the beauty of it: ""at a time"" can be arbitrarily long in real time. [1]<p>You don't even need to simulate every particle in the Universe -- if the simulation is run for you, you only need to simulate enough to convince your brain.  Like when you dream and are convinced something's real, yet upon waking, you realize your criteria were extremely lax.  For all we know, what we think of as being awake is actually a very hazy simulation presented to our ""real"" brains, which are actually much sharper and have been induced into a less-discerning state.<p>Something very interesting at Body Worlds 3 here at OMSI was the brain slices, which showed (according to the placards) that the part we ""think with"" is just the edges, and the interior is interconnections (grey matter vs. white matter).  Compare the darker grey around the folds to the lighter grey filling up the rest:<p><a href=""http://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/cases/caseB/054t_2.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/cases/caseB/054t_2.gif</a><p>So the actual storage needed for a brain's total memory may fit onto a hard drive today, at current estimates (possibly less than a terabyte).  Working memory is much, much less.  Communication (the interconnections) can take as long as needed.<p>[1] Another ""cheat"" would be to put the simulator on a spacecraft travelling at relativistic speeds in a tight orbit around a processing unit; when the simulator sends the processor packets of data to crunch, time dilation would give it extra CPU time.",1187138064

I've even doubted whether it's possible to convince someone who doesn't ""get it"".

42491,comment,42398,42475,0,0,alex_c,,,">To convince yourself of this, consider a matter replicator that copies every single atom in your body. You'd create a clone. It would be thinking and feeling just as you do. Now consider a computer simulation of a single atom; if that can be done, then by extension, it would be possible to simulate anything made of atoms. A simulated clone of you would also behave the same.<p>Impractical to do on current computers - we'd need at the very least quantum computers (I'm guessing that's what the article means by ""Some computer experts have projected, based on trends in processing power, that we will have such a computer by the middle of this century"").<p>But you still run into physical limitations.  Could one atom in a quantum computer be used to simulate more than one ""virtual"" atom at a time?  More than O(n) virtual atoms?  Do you run out of atoms eventually?  Can you actually get infinite recursion that way?  I certainly don't know, and I'm not sure whether the best quantum computing researchers can answer today.<p>Failing that, we'd need something more advanced than quantum computers - so really, at that point we're simply guessing.<p>Very fun philosophical subject, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's ""almost a mathematical certainty"" yet, given our current knowledge...",1187136062

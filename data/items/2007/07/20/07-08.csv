Think about it, the chances that someone gets access to my own computer (stealing it, breaking into my home, or hacking it over the Internet) are higher than the chances of that happening to a professional service provider. At least that's the case for most computer users. I heard recently that 25% of all computers in the world are zombified. So much for security on your own computer.<p>But anyway, that's why I said if you can improve on their offering then go for it. Given the current options, they're the best that I know of; and I say that knowing that they have a lot to improve. So, if you build a better service, I'd consider switching. ",1184917002

If you don't need a business bank account, you can do that too.  PayPal and Google checkout will accept money on your behalf without much trouble.",1184916886

Facebook appears to be a more nimble company and I would be surprised if it had similar problems.""<p>You reckon AOL became the largest ISP by ""failure to adapt""?  No...the failure to adapt came much later.  They ruled for a long time.  Facebook is barely a wee lad in comparison.  If it gets a run as top dog for as long as AOL then Zuckerberg should count his lucky stars.",1184916730

I had all my friends phone numbers kept up to date with no hassle. The application got banned last week and now I'm annoyed at facebook. As much as I like facebook I want to take that data with me sometimes, not even to go join a rival network!",1184916584

Same is true of thttpd and all the rest.<p>Lighty and Nginx are becoming full-featured multiplexing servers. It's a lot of work to add features when all the code must be super reliable and non-blocking. No serious open source effort has ever been made. Zeus has been the only option for years, but it's commercial and expensive. They've made millions filling this void.\n",1184915580

The lottery commission was aware about the increased odds, but they created a higher odds game due to user feedback. Massachusetts still made money off of the game (though a smaller margin than other games).<p>I would argue that a lottery's goal is to make money while providing entertainment, and not necessarily create an ""unbeatable"" game.<p>The game was shut down because public outcry at what the public deemed ""unfair"" and not because it was losing money.",1332550689

These are voluntary checks for high level security clearances with the government.<p>I don't think it's unreasonable to include online social networking profiles in that.<p>Similarly, a court order should be able to get all the data from a profile, but not to allow the government to masquerade as you by logging in and actively communicating with others.<p>This has all been debated during the ""key escrow"" debate period; even the government wasn't able to make an argument for signing key escrow, only encryption key escrow.  It's the same issue with a profile.<p>(I am generally against key escrow, but eliminating some classes of keys from the debate off the bat was a useful strategy then; it would be more useful now.)",1332550666

The above criterion I mentioned does seem to fall apart since I do consider problem solving to be inherently creative even though oftentimes there is only one answer.<p>Good to hear from an actual physician though. Do you think that your initial disappointment is a unique response or do most med students go through it? I ask because everyone I know who is getting accepted to med school has wanted to be a doctor since high school. I assume that makes med students get tunnel-vision when deciding their career choices and have an idealized, incorrect view of the field. (I figure most future doctors just get over this pretty quickly by finding different, but equally important reasons to be in the field.)",1332550560

3748062,comment,3746222,3747427,7,0,eklitzke,,,"I think in practice there have been a few historical problems with this approach. A major one is that while in theory it's possible to secure a process to a chroot jail (either the Linux or the BSD variety) in practice it's hard to defend against arbitrary, possibly malicious programs in that jail.<p>Kernel exploits that rely on local access are uncommon but not incredibly rare. You could easily have a hosting service like this that ran fine for a few months, or even a few years, and then a 0-day kernel exploit comes out (that relies on having local access to the machine) and then you're SOL.<p>Another issue is that in practice some system calls are very expensive. With a little knowledge you can DOS a machine hosting your process if you can run arbitrary system calls -- for instance, if you can create some sort of resource that is expensive for the kernel to track, and then create a lot of that resource. Sort of related to this, at least in Linux there are a very large number of syscalls and new ones are added relatively frequently, and not all syscalls have had the same amount of security auditing.<p>Even if you're not worried about your own servers getting hacked, you need to convince your customers that other users aren't going to be able to intercept or modify their data or attack their VMs.<p>In my mind, one of the main innovation of a lot of the VM stuff in recent years, and in particular the NaCL approach of limiting what system calls can be invoked, is that you are fundamentally reducing the interface by which malicious programs have to attack the hosting machine. If you can securely limit system calls to a small subset, you can more easily audit the paths those system calls make to ensure that they're secure and can't be used in a DOS scenario. In a virtualization environment like Xen or KVM, the amount of code that you have to audit is limited to the Xen/KVM code which is much smaller than the rest of the code base.<p>Just my 2c., etc.",1332550464

You're correct in that the font-rendering used on Windows machines is geared toward different goals that that on Macs, but that fact doesn't make the web page look any better to the user using a PC.<p>And they're going to blame you for using a custom font, not Microsoft.<p>I don't understand the point of your sarcasm in the first line.

The assumption is that lower quality levels will only be a fraction of that size therefore all versions of a single movie won't be more than 20-50GB total. Additionally, many older movies are not available in the high quality formats and take up only a tenth of this space.<p>Also I'd like to point out that the MPAA is the Motion Picture Association of <i>America</i>, which is an American trade association that represents the six big Hollywood studios.

When I was early in my training I was dissappointed in my choice of medicine as a career because I also thought it lacked an outlet for creativity.  As a now experienced physician, there are still times when you get to a point in the care of  some patients at which the next step is programmatic and rote (if A then B).<p>However, sometimes--probably most of the time--the patient's presentation is so unclear (e.g. ""I just feel weird. . . .""), there are so many variables to juggle in your head at once (twenty different lab values, the way the liver feels, the imaging findings, the color of the patient's sclera, the smell of their breath, their mood) that things become far too complex for any flowchart.  These are the times when you need creativity, ""book smarts"" and perhaps above all, ""emotional intelligence"" to be a good doctor.

But the way they have made it, you statistically have to spend more money than you can win in order to do so, or just about break even.<p>Now, the fun part is that most of these tickets (atleast where I live) come with pseudorandom serie numbers, so even finding the system in how the numbers are generated is going to be hard, if not even down-right impossible given the sample-size you will be able to buy.<p>And last but not least, lottery makers are not stupid.

It just so happens that the tail call optimization does get used on x64 platforms because of an implementation detail of the 64-bit JIT.<p>Source: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davbr/archive/2007/06/20/tail-call-jit-conditions.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davbr/archive/2007/06/20/tail-call-j...</a>",1332547437

Some people just don't have personalities that can survive being a hospitalist.  One way to cope is to have hobbies outside of work.  Children are a particularly popular route.  The author doesn't seem to be going down that path, so I think the startup world is a great way to escape a dead end job.",1332547359

3747936,comment,3747686,3747686,1,0,noal,,,"Interesting read; I was playing with similar thoughts over my lunch break a couple of days ago.<p>The base of my sample program [implemented in ruby] was based (in theory) of Proportional Betting ""The Martingale"" - <a href=""http://www.bjmath.com/bjmath/progress/prog1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bjmath.com/bjmath/progress/prog1.htm</a><p>The game I picked was ""Casino War"" [ <a href=""http://wizardofodds.com/games/casino-war/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wizardofodds.com/games/casino-war/</a> ], as it was very quick to implement in a few lines of code. I selected the base rules as played in Garden City Casino [Bay Area] (50c drop per every $100), and came up with the following:<p>Game/House Rules:\n- 6 deck of cards.\n- Played until 1/2 is gone.\n- 50c drop for every $100 [Example: $200 bet costs $1, $300 $1.5.]<p>Betting Rules:<p>- Base Bet is always 1% of current wallet, at starting point - $10.\n- If the proportional bet can not be covered by wallet, the round is surrendered and the player waits until re-shuffle. [Example: Lost up to $500, next bet is $1000, wallet has $700, game ends/waits and the player accepts a loss of $300.]\n- Bets are doubled on loss as defined in the Proportional betting link.<p>Here's my data, though I believe something is wrong due to its results:<p>- I ran the initial program, as is, expecting the player to play one round every day for 10 years.\n- Losses and earnings were added together.\n- The average win % went to 58.4%.\n- The average cash win [the times the player didn't go bankrupt] was $1590.\n- Max loss [consecutive] cash $2980. [Bankroll covered over multiple sessions]<p>* A key point here is the average cash win. It was highly consistent and never below 1500.<p>I then added a factor that stated in the software:<p>- If winnings are at $1500, the player stops, takes the winnings and waits for a re-shuffle.<p>* Win percentage went up to 64.8% !<p>If anyone is interested, I'd be happy to share/pastebin the code or similar. Overall, due to the percentages I'm assuming something is wrong with my assumptions/gameplay, but so far an interesting experiment.<p>[Edited for clarity on betting strategy]",1332547335

It's for subscribers only, but it's far more interesting than the Jonah Lehrer piece. It's about a woman who's won the lottery (scratch tickets) 3 or 4 times, winning millions each time.<p>It's been a while since I read it, but as far as I recall, one of the hypotheses about her good fortune (other than luck and some form of inside information) is that she had analyzed how winning tickets are distributed among batches (by cracking the pseudorandom number generator), and tracking which stores are likely to get packages containing winning tickets by the shipping routes.",1332547268

I'm almost done watching iti right now, and  didn't catch him saying 'right?' at all; maybe it happens in the earlier part, but in the last few minutes, none at all. If he's saying it, I hardly think it's meant as some subtle pysch trick.<p>Nor did I get the feeling that his claims of being wrong was in any way  disingenuous.  At worst it's a ploy to structure his talk.<p>Every TED talk works off the assumption that the speaker has some insight worth sharing with the audience, presumably non-obvious or non-trivial realizations, so <i>of course</i> he's going to try say something worth thinking about.  There's nothing subtext about it; it's the whole point of being on stage.<p>My takeaway was not simply ""for every Steve Jobs, we need a bunch of workers to actually build the iPods"", but that there are a lot of seemingly oddball jobs done by happy people who did not bother to ""follow their bliss"", that conventional wisdom on what work might make you happy or how work should be approached might very well be wrong, and that plain old labor should not be looked down on.",1277106756

By living frugally you can earn $1Million in 5-8years no problem<p>- find someone willing to ""invest"" $1 Million in you.

1448202,comment,1447438,1447438,0,0,HSO,,,"If you were allowed only the proverbial one book on the island, I'd recommend Kuznetsov's ""The Complete Guide to Capital Markets for Quantitative Professionals"".<p>It is one of the rare books where the marketing blurb is actually a valid description: ""...a comprehensive resource for readers with a background in science and technology who want to transfer their skills to the financial industry.""<p>Instead of further praising it myself, I'll copy a reader review from amazon that describes how I feel about it: ""Rarely a book with a title as ambitious as ""Complete Guide"" fulfills its promise. This book does. Big time. 
It is written for quantitative professionals (current and prospective) and gives a bird-view account of all types of activities available to them in a typical Wall Street firm. 
The author cleverly avoids pitfalls of the books of this genre. The book is general enough to cover various settings, but not too general to become useless. It is detailed enough to provide relevant information, but not too detailed to become a software manual or a textbook. 
The text educates without being annoying and entertains without being lightweight. 
Hopefully, readers will appreciate consistency and appropriateness of the book's style. The author avoids over-fragmentation and ""bulletization"": the book consists of 20 chapters without any further subdivisions. It makes for much smoother reading undistracted by unnecessary subheadings. 
After finishing the book one can only marvel at the author's efficiency, wondering how he could cram so much useful and interesting information in just 600 pages. ""<p>Kuznetsov also includes a great commented bibliography for further reading. I know many of the books therein, as well as their competitors, and I can say his are good recommendations (at least, I would have picked the same in most cases and found a lot of good reads there too).",1277103758

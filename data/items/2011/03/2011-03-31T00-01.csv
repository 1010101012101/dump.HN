It was a lot of fun working on a code base like that -- multimedia seemed so arcane before starting out.<p>One of the things I appreciated the most were the code reviews. I had awesome mentors, and my skills have improved significantly thanks to the feedback I got.<p>I haven't contributed much since then (although I am working sporadically on NEONifying the swscale library), but I still monitor the mailing lists, hang around in the IRC channel, and collab with one of my mentors every day on a paying multimedia project. Multimedia hackers are some of the smartest people I know, so I hang around them in the hopes of picking up a few things by osmosis.<p>The only downside to GSoC was the pay, which is quite low, but I got to do things on my own time, like bicycle around and spend half the day at the beach. It was the first really relaxed summer I've had in a long time, coming off 6 years of college -- didn't feel like getting a real job just then. GSoC fit the bill perfectly for me.",1301533189

For me personally, what drives me to either code or play an instrument, or compose music, or create anything at all; it's very similar feeling. Also when you get your program running, or learn to play something, you get the same rewarding feeling.",1301533176

What I find objectionable is not this advantage. It's the fact that failing to secure this advantage is being portrayed as an obvious professional failure that can be simply rectified by working an extra few hours a night on side projects.<p>It is propaganda from open source people, many of who have achieved considerably less in their open source projects than a casual inspection might suggest. Usually I come away from people's open source projects with a cheerful acknowledgement that this person (a) likes cool stuff and (b) appears to be able to write working code of a kind. This is good - but not that good.<p>There's a big difference between 'I wrote some code, look at me' and 'I contributed a competitive register allocator to LLVM' or 'I rewrote the scheduling algorithm for major open source FooOS'. The latter are 'strong contributions' and deserve the 'massive advantage' of which you speak.

The fact that they get thrown out does not prove that an idea was meaningfully stolen (as opposed to the simpler explanation, in which the student experienced a lapse of integrity in following citation requirements).<p>A thought experiment: If I believe that we have a duty to repay society for all that it has done for us, then in order not to be a thief, am I required to raise Immanuel Kant from the dead and ask him for permission every time I want to bring it up in conversation? Obviously, no. I'm allowed to believe the same thing as Immanuel Kant and it is not theft. If I got my ideas from Kant but tried to deny it, that would be <i>dishonest</i>, and he would still be the originator, but ideas aren't really property.<p>This isn't defending what the Long Island Press did, but you're going too far in the other direction.",1301532618

2389937,comment,2387377,2389796,2,0,kragen,,,".06mg/kg is a pretty small lethal dose. That's probably entirely due to the radioactivity.  Tetraethyl lead has a lethal dose of something like 1.2mg/kg <a href=""http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/chemical/organlea.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/chemical/organlea.htm</a> which is 20 times higher.  But that's organic lead, which is rapidly absorbed; lead oxide is something like 600 mg/kg, ten thousand times higher than the dose you calculated for plutonium. But, in that case we're comparing the ingested dose to the dose absorbed; you'd have to ingest about 150mg/kg of PuO to absorb 0.06mg/kg of it.<p>Also, though, the fatal dose of another heavy metal like lead might be lower than the LD reported, because LD tests normally don't give the experimental animals several years to die.<p>So, in conclusion, it seems like accurately comparing plutonium poisoning to poisoning by other heavy metals requires more knowledge than I have.

Whereas with athletes, this is not the case.  Roger Bannister is famous for running the first (recorded) four minute mile, whereas today running a four minute mile isn't even considered noteworthy.  Sporting records regularly tumble, and when they do the athlete that set the previous record diminishes a little in our eyes (I'm not arguing that this is good or right, just that <i>it is</i>), whereas Shakespeare and Tolkein are always going to be up on their pedestals.<p>When I used to read lots of Fantasy I would pick up books in shops and read the blurbs on the back, and almost everyone was going to be 'the next Tolkein' or 'bigger and better than Tolkein' or some such hyperbole.  Now I can easily imagine someone being better than Tolkein (he spends an entire page describing a forest just talking about <i>trees</i> for goodness sake.

One flaw I see is there is only a key to turn the pieces one direction, and not he other, this should be implemented to increase speed of laying.

Sells maybe a million units in the first three months.<p>3) Consumers shopping for a tablet are now faced with a choice: I can buy an iPad and wait four to five weeks for it to arrive (those are the times Apple's website is currently quoting), or I can buy a HP TouchPad and take it home today. For some, that'll be enough to bring them over to HP.<p>4) HP's TouchPad gets some traction. Enough to justify a version two. Nowhere near enough to knock Apple off it's perch.<p>5) HP does something badly wrong. One of the MBAs gets in the way, makes a decision he has no place making, and hands one of HP's competitors a major competitive advantage. Maybe they decide the TouchPad should be US only for the first year. Maybe they piss off developers in some creative way, so no-one writes apps for the platform. I don't know what they'll do, but I can't shake the feeling that they'll fuck it up somehow.<p>6) Android tablets come out too. Nerds like me buy them, while our grandmothers buy iPads and TouchPads. There are many more grandmothers in the world than nerds. Android tablets do badly. Attempting to explain this, reviewers looking at 2011 retrospectively will cite a confusing UI, a flash implementation that was promised but never materialised (or materialised in a broken state), and many of the same compatibility issues that we see now with Android phones.<p>7) Microsoft announces Windows 8 with a completely redesigned UI based on Metro. This UI will try to work just as well with the keyboard and mouse as it does on touch devices. Ballmer will use the phrase ""bridging the gap"" a lot.",1301531536

In building Quora, he decided in hindsight to use Python and had Facebook not been so entrench in it, they probably would have switched.

And as a hiring manager, seeing extensive open-source work is better than seeing a resume. That means the advice is ALWAYS good advice. There is never a situation under which the proper career advice is to not do good visible work.<p>This doesn't mean it's a requirement, or should be a requirement, but it IS a reality. If you choose not to participate, that's fine, but it comes with an inarguable cost. You can try to convince us all that it shouldn't, but it does, and it probably always will.",1301530374

2389831,comment,2387463,2388212,4,0,jacques_chester,,,"Actually, if someone promises you a million dollars <i>verbally</i>, then in common law you can rely on that promise (subject to many caveats and details, IANAL etc). In fact you might be able to rely on it in several ways -- contract law, estoppel law etc.<p>To avoid he-said/she-said, many business contracts include a written ""no-verbals clause"", saying in essence that the contract can't be amended except in writing.<p>This is necessary because contractual relationships do not need to be written. The elements which the law pattern matches to say ""this is a contract"" do not require ""must be written down somewhere"" (though again, there are exceptions - for example many jurisdictions have legislation requiring property contracts to be in writing). For example, when you buy a stick of gum, you have negotiated, agreed to and executed a contract with an agent of the seller (the clerk). Contracts are largely invisible in every day life, but they exist. The decision to write them down is a risk-management exercise, where contract parties realise that the cost of settling disputes about verbal disputes is higher than the cost of signing a written contract.<p>In this case the common sense has been to rule that an IM message was ""writing"", thus it was not treated by the no-verbals clause, thus it successfully amended the original contract.<p>Now currently these modification clauses are blacklisting based. You name what you <i>won't</i> count as modifying the contract. If it hasn't happened already, a smart lawyer will look for a whitelisting approach, where you list what will count in future. So instead of ""no verbal, no IM, no twitter, no currently-unforeseen-service-X"", you'll get ""on paper only"".<p>Again, I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice etc etc.",1301530339

But because they were a Microsoft shop they had decided that they were going to have all the client side events in VBScript (don't ask why, down that path lies madness).<p>So faced with the choice of an ASP page with a mix of client side VBScript and server side VBScript it was pretty hard, so I switched the server side to Javascript (or ECMAScript or JScript or whatever Micorsoft's implementation was called that week).<p>That made the demarcation between client and server (in the same source file) enormously much more clear.  Consequently productivity went way up when we did that.<p>I <i>still</i> think that was the wrong way round (Javascript on the client, VBScript on the server would have been better in every single way), but having the two languages was definitely the way to go.  Yes, you need to context switch, but when you switch from client to server you need to context switch <i>anyway</i>.",1301529966
2389811,comment,2389707,2389707,2,0,code,,,"> but I don't need the entrepreneurial sense<p>Horrible statement. You want your cofounder to be very entrepreneurial regardless of whether he's the business cofounder or the technical cofounder. Otherwise what you're really looking for is a coding monkey disguised as a cofounder to avoid having to pay because you don't have the means to.<p>> I need someone with a greater or equal knowledge of programming and (more importantly) a drive to actually use that knowledge.<p>Having a drive is important. Either you or your cofounder needs to be good enough on the technical side. But it sounds like you're discrediting someone who knows his business and marketing chops. Its definitely hard to find someone that knows it in high school but I would be careful about disregarding this in favor of technical talent if you are already a developer. A lot of startups fail not because they aren't able to build their product, it's because they're unable to get it out to the market.<p>> I know a few people in startups and plenty of people who work in some part of Silicon Valley, but most of those people are considerably older than me (40+) and/or not someone who I would want to work with.<p>Age shouldn't be a determining factor albeit I can see where you're coming from. However there are plenty of people in their 20s in the valley and the startup scene.<p>> You might be wondering how being in high school is related to finding a co-founder, or if not a co-founder someone to work on a particular project with, and it's because based on what I've read/heard, people find co-founders in college/university. I don't have that advantage of being grouped with people of similar interest.<p>No, we're not wondering that. College just is the norm. You need to get a better idea of what you actually need in a cofounder rather than just what you assume you need. And you can find ways to network and meet people of similar interest, even in the East Bay.<p>Hope that helps.",1301529955

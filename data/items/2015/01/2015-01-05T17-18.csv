A modern telecom is a shitshow of legacy junk that should be thrown out.<p>Granted, this is kinda happening with some carriers and google voice, but the move to LTE-only with VOIP needs to happen sooner than later.

The bad news is young developers tend not to have the advantage that comes with experience or a respect for the history of previous implementations.<p>I&#x27;m often horrified by some of the JavaScript I see - including very popular frameworks that developers &quot;love&quot; written by engineers people respect. The complexity is frightening, and every month there&#x27;s some new word or phrase describing a programming concept I&#x27;ve simply never seen before.<p>Maybe some of it is necessary - an honest attempt to satisfy the needs of a browser client, rather than a server.

Even with 25 years in the field, I still ask other engineers about changes I want to make. Quite often we talk through any ripple effects before I set hands to keyboard.<p>Be especially careful in modifying interfaces, library calls, etc. Basically, any module that other systems depend on should be modified with a lot of caution and testing. Your caution should grow at least linearly with the dependency graph.<p>Over time you will develop a sense of which changes you can make without asking, which changes you should talk with others about, and which ones to stay clear of.<p>Your primary responsibility is creating good software. Your second responsibility is staying employed. Don&#x27;t fret over every oddity you see in a code base. Refactoring is good for all the reasons people listed in the comments.

I learned to program about 2-3 years ago and  have been increasingly active in open source contributions, and even maintaining my own (somewhat) popular open source project.  I&#x27;ve been learning all the important stuff I missed in college by not majoring in CS: algorithms, data structures, etc.  I&#x27;ve got a pretty nice Github for someone who&#x27;s only been into this a few years.  I love programming and want to do it full-time.<p>The (potential) problem is, I went through a stage when I was pretty amazed by Bitcoin technology (and I&#x27;m still pretty amazed by it).  And I even got some modest code contributions into the core Bitcoin client.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not a Bitcoin fanatic or invester.  In fact, I&#x27;ve been pretty disappointed by the number of scammers and stock-pumper types the project has attracted. And none of my other open source projects are Bitcoin related, nor are my blog posts, which cover a variety of other technical topics.  And I&#x27;ve got Github contributions to some other big, popular open source projects.<p>But seeing the negative reaction that some popular HNers have to Bitcoin, I&#x27;m really worried that my Bitcoin contributions will be seen as a negative by potential employers and even potentially rule me out as a job candidate, particularly in my small city, which is very far from being SV.<p>Problem is, I can&#x27;t just delete the Bitcoin contributions from my Github account without deleting the account, and then I lose all my other (positive, and hopefully impressive) code to show employers.<p>This shouldn&#x27;t be such a negative, since it&#x27;s not easy to get code into the Bitcoin core project (there is, after all, a large economy that depends upon it).

After tinkering I began working with the manufacturer to mold the silicone bracelets with RFID chips and file a patent.<p>As a law student, I found the patent filing process to bring real world practice to my classroom theory, plus I learned a lot about RFID technology in the process (mostly researching prior art, such as, RFID shopping carts; RFID one time use hospital bands; ect...).  However, as a law student I had no practical (financial) way of bringing my idea to market.<p>Nevertheless, I contacted Disney&#x27;s director of park operations to discuss the potential of my RFID silicone bands acting as park tickets, monetary accounts and the general efficiency RFID bands could have of park operation efficiency (tracking lines, ride times, open seats, ect...).  As one might expect I was blown off, given a nice generic response that there is no interest...but sure enough 7-8 years later the parks have incorporated RFID technology through the use of...silicone bands.<p>I think such a story highlights the various positions one could take on our patent existing system.  Some might say I was a patent troll, filing a patent where I knew I could never financially bring a product to market, others would argue that situation is why patents exist where the inventor needs to protect an idea where often times but for being the inventor/patent filer a giant corporation might come along and simply take an idea without any benefit to the inventor...finally some may say I should not have received a patent in the first place as RFID silicone bands are not <i>non-obvious</i> in the first place.<p>Though I never sued, my own experience brings a certain bias to the table, and I would simply ask in countries that do not have a similar intellectual system to the US, is there an example of an inventor actually bringing an invention to market where they were not simply beat out by an existing corporation?",1420478833

Articles like this were written after each and every single crash, which eventually led to sharper requirements, more certification, added security gizmos and thingies and more safe-ropes in every single corner of the aircraft. Most of that was reasonable, but care must be taken when making systems more complicated and static by taking what seems to be the easy route of &quot;just adding a fix&quot;.<p>The reason why most of these systems seem anachronistic is not due to the high costs and financial pressure on the airline companies. Most systems seem so anachronistic because they have to be incredibly reliable and robust. Flight recorders are built to withstand about any disaster you can throw at them, which would be quite hard to do achieve with a modern cloud-enabled micro-electronic device. Even if we threw billions at the problem, it would most likely take five years to build a mass-deployable remote aviation telemetry system of the required quality level, just because making hardware is hard, and a half-assed solution helps nobody. It&#x27;s particularly unlikely that a niche solution like the one suggested in the article works for everybody.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- added safety is always nice. But let&#x27;s take a step back for the moment. Let us not just put another whole new box into every aircraft after every crash. Instead, let&#x27;s  try and make the smallest possible adjustment to what is a well-proven, existing system already.<p>There have been reports after the MH370 loss that turbine telemetry data had been transmitted even after all other systems had failed. An small adjustment would be to lower the interval in which this signal was transmitted, down to say 30 seconds, provided the comm satellites are prepared to handle this. I&#x27;m not an expert on avionics, and I&#x27;m not claiming that this is the egg of Columbus, but surely there has to be a nice, small, lightweight and elegant solution, which <i>incidentally</i> is cheap on top of this.",1420478303

New high growth companies often have lots of money to hire new people, buy new equipment, build new office buildings, etc. When revenue eventually levels off or drops, often there are no longer enough resources to support everything that was built up in the growth phase. In older companies you might see a lot of old worn out equipment and infrastructure that is not getting repaired due to lack of resources. This effect can be seen on a larger scale in cities or even nations that experience a slowdown in growth.<p>What if aging is simply a side effect of the fact that we stop growing at a certain age? It could be that certain key resources needed to fully repair the body are reduced or shut off once growth stops. Aging might even be a kind of negative growth.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that the effects of aging don&#x27;t start showing up until after we stop growing. Also, the rate at which different forms of life age seems to be related to the growth rate. Some types of turtle can live to be over 200 years old but take 50 years to grow to full size.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to see if there is any research into aging along these lines. If aging is related to growth, perhaps an anti-aging treatment could be as simple as finding a way to restart growth for short periods of time to generate the additional resources needed to repair damaged tissue. I have heard of human growth hormone being used as an anti-aging treatment though something tells me there would be more involved than just one hormone.",1420477753

There&#x27;s so many hypothetical fixes on the Internet, some seems to improve intermittently and temporarily, some seems to not work at all. But toggling Bluetooth seems be able to get a reaction from the OS at times. It felt like a ritual and I&#x27;m praying to the OS god.<p>Then one day a fortnight ago, I chanced upon another solution. Some people are speculating that because the WiFi signals is clashing with Bluetooth signals as they are both in 2.4 GHz, its affecting the WiFi. I was using Apple Wireless Keyboard & Touchpad. I have friend who had similar setup who seems to have the same issue.<p>So the next day, I spent 464 USD just to upgrade my router, get a wired Keyboard and a wired Mouse.<p>I have definitely splurged on these hardwares but at this point I am so frustrated and desperate that I need to make sure any hardware issue is out of the question. These are the only variables I can control, anything  else felt hopeless.<p>I then jumped on 5 GHz WiFi and stop using bluetooth. My WiFi situation have improved a lot since then. Not perfect, but not un-usable.<p>The point is that I could have saved those money. To spend so as to fix a bug felt so Window&#x27;ish. It use to just work, and glitch are bearable, now I always worry of upgrading.<p>Anyway, those money could have went into buying Apple stuff.",1420477600

8839757,comment,8838666,8838666,0,0,trcollinson,,,"A common phrase my colleagues often hear out of me goes something like this: &quot;The two greatest works of 21st century fiction are technical job descriptions and the resumes that were written to match those descriptions.&quot; A high percentage of the time they aren&#x27;t looking for all of those skills at all, and sometimes none of those skills at all. They just hope that description will attract resumes. They have cast a wide net and are looking to see what they will catch.<p>I put out an &quot;intern&quot; level job description about 5 years ago now. At first I put down the bare minimum skills we needed. We were not only willing to train but expected we would have to, so the description was little more than &quot;Good personality&quot;, &quot;desire to learn to develop software&quot;, &quot;can type&quot;, things like that. We got zero response. So I added in more and more things until I had a wide enough net to get the right person. We hired a person who had two years of school under his belt and hadn&#x27;t worked in a professional development position at all. He had no idea how to develop and was scared to death that he didn&#x27;t have the skills we needed! We convinced him it would be fine and we would train him. He did a lot of learning on his own after he took the job and we did a lot of helping him with training. He didn&#x27;t make much but he learned a lot. Fast forward 5 years and now he&#x27;s quite an adept engineer and works consulting in the DevOps area of things, doing exceptionally well (better than many of the people who trained him!).<p>A few take aways for you: First, don&#x27;t try to learn everything in a job description before going in for an interview. You might find that they don&#x27;t really want all of that stuff anyway.<p>Second, if you want to know the best skill you can work on as a Web Developer it is simply your personal and speech skills. I hired that guy above because he was nice to talk to, easy for the team to get along with, and honest. He was also obviously smart but definitely new in his skills. His personality got him the job.<p>Finally, as for actual technical skills, HTML, CSS, and Javascript in general will get you through most of the &quot;technical&quot; questions in a junior interview. Keep up on those and you&#x27;ll do fantastic.<p>Edit: I obviously can&#x27;t type today. Fixed some of the many typos.",1420477563

8839743,comment,8839194,8839194,0,0,jeswin,,,"I don&#x27;t think Angular can be fixed, without throwing out everything in 1.x.<p>What&#x27;s wrong:<p>1. UIs are complex. Angular tries to solve this by attaching a lot of programming capability into its templating language. That makes the template itself very complex, which is the situation with Angular right now. Instead of injecting some programming capability into html-like templating, a better way would be to insert templating into a full programming language. Example, JSX.<p>2. One of the great things about the evolving JS ecosystem (as seen in say, the npm registry) is that components and libraries are tiny, and usually they do only one thing. While there are a few disadvantages to this, it also gives incredible flexibility. From my experience it reduces risk (because components are smaller and better understood) and makes it possible to adopt newer ideas/tech faster (because you could incrementally add small components). Angular on the other hand, tried to do too much.<p>3. Frameworks should enable users to re-use what they already know, instead of making them go through dozens of pages of documentation. Learning Angular takes as much time as learning JavaScript. We should encourage libraries which take advantage of what programmers already know, so that they can spend time working on features instead of learning the framework.",1420477293

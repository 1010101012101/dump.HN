If you exercise to burn fat, what's to stop you from becoming cripplingly exhausted rather than burn even a gram a fat?<p>If we can establish the body's mechanism for building fat or burning it, that is the thread that will unravel most fad diets, exercise regimens, and theories.  If you take the time to understand the hormone feedback and homeostasis system involved in fat building/burning, then simplistic ""eat less burn more"" approach begins to break down.  You can see that eating certain foods certain ways actually stimulates your metabolism and triggers fat burning.  Also, <i>certain</i> approaches to exercise actually trigger fat building.<p>> More accurate would be food = energy, exercise = energy expenditure, obesity = prolonged energy surplus stored as fat, and weight loss = prolonged calorie deficit leading to fat reduction.<p>This view turns the human body into a very simple black box.

And how often and what exactly gets crawled? Lets say a client wants to implement a news.google.com or google alerts (or even tineye) - just as an example - it would analyze a web crawl stream from you and get data out of your system to their servers for utilization? How would such a, presumably large, data get transferred over to the client? What is provided as crawled data? Only a html stream, or the whole page that includes js, css and pictures? Or would a client need to get image links from your crawl and get images themselves? Sorry for lots of questions and incoherency :) but it does look interesting.",1242753264

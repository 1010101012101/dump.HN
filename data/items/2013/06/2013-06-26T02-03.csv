Serving is, therefore, part of the social contract. We work, we pay taxes, and we do lots of work for others&#x27; benefit. Nothing wrong with that. To rip from <i>Game of Thrones</i>, <i>valar dohaeris</i>.<p>In fact, most people rot in a life where they don&#x27;t get opportunities to help out (i.e. serve) others and become deeply unhappy. They feel unfulfilled.<p>It&#x27;s the alienating and creepy institutional experience, the entrenched ingrate upper class, the perverse social demands, and the dehumanizing, corrupt, and capricious evaluation process-- and, in addition to all this, the fact that it has nothing to do with productivity (people could be just as productive, if not moreso, in better environments)-- that make institutional Work so horrible.<p>People like to do things for other people. That&#x27;s not a waste of life. That&#x27;s a major part of being human. Being forced to do things-- often boring, degrading things-- in some subordinate context is what makes people miserable at work.",1372215558

Also, the NSA is an arm of the DoD; as such, its job is to keep the country safe from external attackers.

The steering wheel is connected directly to the wheels, and can&#x27;t be controlled by the electronics.

OO on the other hand is directly at odds with reuse because you marry logic and data together into classes. If you write a method and you need to use it for a different problem, you often have to jump through hoops to do it.
On top of it OO encourages premature classification. If you create a class and you need to use that data in a different way later you have to translate it in some way. This is why you have things like wrapper and adapter patterns.</i><p>This can&#x27;t be emphasized enough.

5943806,comment,5943258,5943258,23,0,cwzwarich,,,"There are a couple of things you want to do (some of which overlap with the article):<p>1) Use a register-based VM (with a sliding and growing register file) instead of a stack-based VM. In theory you can make a stack-based VM fast with lots of macroinstructions that fuse smaller operations together, but it isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>2) Use inline caching for method calls, property accesses, and primitive operations that do type checks. In an interpreter you can modify the instruction stream even on platforms that disallow modification of executable code. I know this isn&#x27;t the origin of the technique in bytecode interpreters, but here&#x27;s a paper describing it in case it&#x27;s not obvious:<p><a href=""http://www.lirmm.fr/~ducour/Doc-objets/ECOOP10/papers/6183/61830429.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lirmm.fr/~ducour/Doc-objets/ECOOP10/papers/6183/6...</a><p>3) Pick your value encoding carefully. You almost always want fast immediate integers. On 64-bit platforms it is quite common these days to repurpose some of the NaN range in IEEE doubles for type tags to enable storing doubles in immediate values.<p>4) Write your interpreter in assembly. Compilers generate terrible code for interpreters, even (especially?) with the use of computed goto / labels-as-values extensions. The register allocators of traditional compilers are designed to optimize loops by moving spill code outside of them and to reduce the impact of function calls. They will not be able to realistically allocate registers across different instruction bodies, and they won&#x27;t be able to make the correct tradeoff about how much work to push into the slow path of instruction bodies.<p>5) Rearrange your instruction bodies based on execution / transition frequencies to improve instruction cache performance.<p>6) Pay close attention to the boundaries between your interpreter and the runtime libraries / the FFI. You don&#x27;t want to take a bigger hit than you need to every time you call out to native code.",1372213975

My dataset includes many long lists of numbers (lats, longs, altitudes, timestamps, etc.).  A 700 route dataset is about 25MB in a sqlite database, but trying to access any significant portion of it quickly maxes out the 4GB of RAM available on either of my dev machines (which is more than I could reasonably expect to be provisioned in the cloud).

A different thing is, &quot;WebGL is fundamentally flawed, will never work, IE will not and should not support it ever&quot;.<p>Of course the same people are already changing the discourse and claiming that _now_ WebGL is safe, and IE11&#x27;s WebGL will have the upper hand in security because MS controls the whole stack, etc.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t appreciate the change, I&#x27;m really happy that IE11 is apparently going to be an awesome improvement (over IE10 which is already pretty good, even if dated).",1372212049

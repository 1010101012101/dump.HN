62869,comment,62811,62859,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Biotech is a huge and broad-ranging field. It could be a really old, staunchy industry (people have been making drugs and making biological modifications since forever), or a brand new thing, depending on your vantage point. You need a lot of specialized equipment. Results are slow.  You pretty much need a PhD in order to do any sort of meaningful work in the field. Etc. It really depends on what you mean, but the national capitals for a lot of innovative biotech work in the USA are Bay Area and Boston. <p> ",1191461907

Someone who's not yet an adult will tend to respond to a challenge from an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance. If an adult says ""that's a stupid idea,"" a kid will either crawl away with his tail between his legs, or rebel. But rebelling presumes inferiority as much as submission. The adult response to ""that's a stupid idea,"" is simply to look the other person in the eye and say ""Really? Why do you think so?""</i><p>So they test flexibility as a sign on maturity.

62864,comment,62750,62803,0,0,nailer,,,"You seem to be suggesting that Open Source projects allow just anyone to modify their code.<p>Nobody is open to just anyone modifying their code, whether Open Source or proprietary. <p>Random people from the internet cannot have their code accepted into the Linux kernel, Firefox, GNU, Java, Ruby, or any other popular Open Source project. They do not have commit access, and the people that can commit code vet contributions quite extensively. <p>The only group who suggests otherwise is Microsoft - I'm surprised your comment has been moderated up.",1191461234

If you sell in volume you might even sell it like zimbra did to yahoo.<p>as a freemium, i do not think your business is as scalable.  what do the yc investors think on here?  i would guess if they are going to invest, they are going to use similar rules that someone like sequoia might, and they look for billion dollar companies.  what is YC looking for?<p>have you thought about your exit strategy?  are you in it for the long haul, or for a certain amount of wealth?",1191459891

Obviously there are different levels of ""tech"" companies, but I feel the promise of open source software is to see more diverse applications of that software = more diverse business ideas.<p>If marketing people can't build tech companies should coders be allowed to market their websites?",1191459821

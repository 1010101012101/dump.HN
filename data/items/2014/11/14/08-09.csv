But this drive will never be completed.<p>It&#x27;s very easy and common to make the leap from EMH, a purely theoretical construct, to asserting that real world markets are perfectly efficient and must therefore behave as EMH entails.  This view is mistaken, and the author merely knocks down a straw man with the Buffett counterexample.  Instead, in order to use EMH in the real world, one must first judge the efficiency of the market in question.<p>The broadest, deepest, most active and open markets are the most efficient, which is why &quot;the stock market&quot; (in the US) is a favorite example and testing ground.  The idea is not that it&#x27;s perfectly efficient but that it&#x27;s the most efficient we can access.  The real question is: is it efficient enough for efficiency effects to dominate?  A fair view of the evidence (i.e. not hunting for or cherry-picking counterexamples) suggests that efficiency effects do dominate.<p>EMH is really about the futility of systematic approaches to achieving excess returns.  It was conceived (in some part) as a general refutation to systematic investment proposals.  Systems could range in sophistication from <i>always bet on black</i> to <i>virtual Warren Buffett</i>.  Only where the system sophistication exceeds (in some sense) the current market efficiency is it able to collect.  Soon the unsophisticated have no chips, and the efficiency rises accordingly.  The bar is raised, over and over, chewing up new challengers and enshrining champions.<p>That some real world markets are subject to EMH effects also explains the cliché about the highly paid fund manager who performs no better than a dart-throwing monkey.  If you find  this idea appealing yet EMH is icky, you should check your priors.",1415953541

First, they were (apparently) requiring remote workers to move to the Bay Area.[1]  This is weird in and of itself, and not necessarily with much precedent:  it&#x27;s one thing to decide that you don&#x27;t want to have a distributed work force and/or grow locally, but it&#x27;s quite another to decide that you want an extant remote work force to magically become local -- especially when local is the most expensive housing market in the country, and one that is essentially impossible to enter as an established adult.<p>Then, on top of that, they&#x27;re moving the office to... Daly City?!  Daly City is essentially the worst of all worlds: it&#x27;s not really readily accessible to anyone -- and it&#x27;s an undesirable eye sore on top of it.  There are places that make no sense to relocate to that still make more sense than Daly City (e.g., Pleasanton, San Rafael, Alameda, Walnut Creek, Burlingame) -- Daly City is almost where you would locate a company if you simply hated the employees.  So at that point, you do begin to wonder about the mental stability of the CEO: the choice of Daly City is so completely bizarre that it almost certainly reflects other things amiss in the way decisions are made.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/yishan/status/517365027515285504"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/yishan/status/517365027515285504</a>",1415953272

8606270,comment,8600716,8600716,0,0,pseingatl,,,"What&#x27;s this case about? An employee who had a dispute with his supervisor. As in most cases, the supervisor won. The employee&#x27;s future with the company is destroyed. The supervisor is protected by the company. The employee sues.<p>There may or may not be long-term collateral damage. The alleged victim, Discovery, isn&#x27;t talking and may already have settled with Amazon outside the context of litigation. The supervisor&#x27;s fraudulent resumé is now a matter of public record. She will be kept on at least until this lawsuit is over because Amazon needs her as a witness. After the case is resolved, she will resign.<p>Could this matter have been resolved any other way? Probably not. It&#x27;s sad to see that legacy companies are just as bureaucratic as legacy ones. Jeff Blackburn is culpable for not censuring Munira R. after Kivin V. brought this matter to his attention--after all, he was the one who insisted on a fix. Kivin should have tried to convince Munira R. to go with him to Jeff Blackburn. If she said no, then he would have to weigh her probable reaction. Clearly, Kivin miscalculated. He didn&#x27;t realize how powerful Munira R. is at Amazon and what allies she had--and I say had because her time at Amazon is numbered. A person in Munira&#x27;s position, who has to keep a secret, must weigh the possibility that secret will get out. Her miscalculation was thinking that Kivin would get fired and go away and her secret would remain hidden.<p>Matters like this are clearly not serious enough for board intervention. It&#x27;s for that reason that you have management in the first place. The board does not manage day to day affairs of the business and relies on management to do so.<p>For Amazon, this squabble is a distraction that harms the company. What happens when companies get sued is that they circle the wagons. Whatever you might say about throwing attorneys at a problem, those attorneys know that because of Munira, their case is vulnerable. Munira&#x27;s lies will be Exhibit #1 during her cross-examination. Indeed, her own attorneys will have to bring out her c.v. falsification--and not through the weasel-worded, &quot;she had yet to complete the degree&quot; nonsense spouted by Jeff Blackburn during his deposition. He was poorly coached by Amazon&#x27;s attorneys. He should have simply admitted that she lied. Otherwise the follow-up--when you drag in twelve strangers off the street and make them sit together and call them a jury--will be, why can&#x27;t you admit the obvious? Are you trying to hide something? What might that be? Amazon was probably blindsided by Munira&#x27;s lies: as a top executive under a clear policy to tell the truth and an HR department that could easily have followed up, Amazon&#x27;s general counsel and attorneys could not have expected that she would have lied. If you think you can&#x27;t lose a case because a single witness lied about an unrelated matter, try rewinding the OJ tapes and listen to the cross of Mark Fuhrman.<p>So what now? Amazon&#x27;s smart move is to ignore the sit-in because all an arrest or eviction will do is bring more unwanted attention to the case. They may ask the judge in the case for an injunction preventing the sit-in because it is arguably an unethical settlement move not provided for by the Rules of Civil Procedure, and Kivin agreed to follow those rules by filing suit.<p>Amazon has already backed down from the non-compete clause. I&#x27;m sure they would love to settle the case. But guys who camp out on your doorstep are usually difficult to settle with. Maybe Kivin sees millions of dollars--an executive paid $250k/yr. with thirty years of work, plus injury to reputation, plus interest would be entitled to a substantial sum. My guess is that Kivin doesn&#x27;t want to settle. He feels hurt, wants to prove he&#x27;s right, wants his day in court.<p>My advice to both sides: settle. Kivin: take less than what you think they owe you, get them to agree to give you a glowing reference (though in the publicity-heavy context of this case I don&#x27;t know valuable this will be immediately) and agree not to disparage Amazon. Amazon: despite the fact that your lawyers have told you this is a winnable case, it will only get worse. You have nothing to gain.<p>To both of you:  don&#x27;t you guys watch Star Trek? Don&#x27;t you remember the lesson of the Kobayashi Maru? Litigation is like that test that only Captain Kirk ever beat:  the only way to win is not to play the game. If you win, you still lose heavily.",1415952941

That gets rolled into a periodic upgrade package that the end-users are conditioned to fear, because it always interferes with their work for at least a week.<p>That&#x27;s just the stuff I make up in my head when I don&#x27;t know the whole story, because that&#x27;s what matches up with my anecdotal life experience.",1446479585

I&#x27;ll explain why.<p>The main issue is that once you exceed a certain number of developers, the problems become more human than software. It&#x27;s not the software problem we need to solve, and our solution to the human problem thus far is highly individual and anti-system, riddled with ineffective processes, &quot;communication problems,&quot; and &quot;culture issues&quot; that we believe are someone else&#x27;s problem that we can do very little to fix even as leaders. These are the root cause of quality issues, and without looking at the whole system—and indeed, creating a whole organization capable of looking at the whole system—the quality issues will continue dependably.<p>The final issue is that when it comes to people problems, everyone has their own beliefs. Ideas are easy—ideas can be explained, processes implemented, software designed—but beliefs are hard. If I were to write to a VC outlining these ideas (which are W. Edwards Deming&#x27;s ideas circa 1950, Joseph Juran&#x27;s ideas circa 1980, and Peter Sholtes&#x27;s ideas continuing into the 90&#x27;s, and the foundation of the current Lean movement in software, education, manufacturing, and healthcare)‚ what would really change? I can make a convincing argument, but I would be in for a 1-3 year conversation about beliefs about management and people, depending on the person and their adaptability and openness to new ideas. It&#x27;s much easier to simply do it, and I&#x27;m trying to do as much as I can in the context of a growing company at present.<p>Plus, there are companies who are already into this stuff. Pluralsight integrates Deming&#x27;s philosophy into their management and onboarding. Check them out.<p>Someday I will start my own company, and these concepts will be at the foundation. For sure. Until then, I&#x27;ll try my best to shift some perspectives.",1446479539

The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work. This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms).<p>#Position 2: Data Savvy, Impeccably Responsible, Scala, Storm, Hbase & Kafka<p>We need someone to help build our data pipeline and optimization systems.

Now, please do not misunderstand, I am not suggesting your employer is not trustworthy.<p>The sad truth, as revealed in com.zone and other large zone files, is that most of the domains registrars sell (rent) are garbage and only used for &quot;domain parking&quot; and serving ads.<p>Indeed, the people selling DNS hardware, not to mention consulting, are benefitting financially from pushing DNSSEC.<p>To me, that &quot;gold-plated pipe&quot; that I have full control over is far more important than any third party purporting to &quot;sell&quot; me an entry in a public zone file or to &quot;authenticate&quot; some public data on my behalf.<p>I can create, retrieve and manage my own data.

This also just makes things really easy to hack on and to ship other behaviors, that may not be strictly linting but still make sense as PR comments, that Hound didn&#x27;t envision.

The statement is either right or wrong. Being able to cite people who merely assert an opinion doesn&#x27;t make them automatically worth having on an encyclopedia page.<p>As examples, the wiki page for Barack Obama doesn&#x27;t mention the claim that he&#x27;s a Muslim or that his birth certificate was faked anywhere .... because it&#x27;s factually incorrect nonsense that shouldn&#x27;t be on a wiki page.

But here&#x27;s the big problem; we know the causal force for this &quot;inequality reduction&quot;, and it&#x27;s not that someone wanted to make Chinese or Mexican workers richer (or that they would get better at demanding better pay). The causal force was that capitalists in the U.S. and small group of people outside the U.S. (usually people in power in developing countries, like members of the Chinese communist party) wanted to get richer at expense of everybody else.<p>Based on this known causal force, there is no reason to think that capitalism itself causes more equality. (And in fact, globalization has been shown to counteract ability of countries to compete, see for example book Kicking Away the Ladder from Ha-Joon Chang, who is korean. Countries that depend on internal demand and supply rather than foreign investment and exports tend to fare much better in closing the economic gap with respect to developed world.)",1446478685

Lots of long winded meandering that boils down to fiddling while rome burns.  You&#x27;ve got legacy revenue for awhile, real estate, and employees, take advantage of it and pivot.  &quot;I know, we&#x27;ll try to undercut the entire internet&quot; LOL &quot;We&#x27;ll just work harder than everyone else&quot; LOL &quot;We&#x27;ll sell only the most expensive products to the richest customers because they like to waste time&quot; LOL &quot;We&#x27;ll define excellent service as being obnoxious and in your face as possible&quot; LOL The first consultant is featherbedding &quot;We need more consultants to get more data&quot;.<p>For example, Barnes and Noble has abandoned selling books and has pivoted semi successfully into &quot;convenience store for birthday gifts&quot; complete with wrapping.  They still have a section of the store for books, but its not really a book store anymore.  They have a better chocolate section than my local discount grocery store!  In the specific example, moving in on B+N turf isn&#x27;t going to work as a strategy unless you think you can out B+N, B+N itself.<p>AFAIK no one has ever tried food and consumer electronics shopping, so eat &quot;real&quot; food while showrooming sample TVs and then order one shipped to your door.  This is not entirely insane.  A liquor license and pleasant wait staff might discourage showrooming... &quot;Hey everyone gets a round on the house, Joey bought a new TV&quot; woo hoo ...<p>Something to think about is there is more retail CRE square footage today than ever in the history of the country and its all more or less becoming useless as currently designed and zoned.  You may end up pivoting totally out of old fashioned retail, perhaps a fitness club, or barber shop, or restaurant.  You want to be the first retail market to become an exercise club not try to be the last.  Locally food and other retail stores that have closed have successfully opened as credit union branches, exercise club, restaurants, and car dealerships, more examples probably exist.  To make a large scale national strategy, it might be useful to gather this small scale success data.  Apparently you cannot pay the rent selling turnips in that specific retail frontage, but you can pay the rent selling time on a bench press machine, interesting...<p>Alternately you can ride right down into a crater, like that crazy general in Dr Strangelove, if it no longer works just keep on doing what doesn&#x27;t work but harder than everyone else, what could possibly go wrong?  In all honesty if you have no future it does show bravery of a sort to keep doing what you&#x27;re doing until the bankruptcy, but admit what you&#x27;re doing, at least, you&#x27;re just riding a dead business model until impact with the ground, milking the last cash cow till it becomes pink slime.",1446477968

10492211,comment,10486271,10487048,0,0,soylentcola,,,"Yeah, I&#x27;m a mix between the two.  I do use Amazon because it makes it easy to compare lots of products and prices and when they have something I want with Prime shipping (and occasionally same-day shipping) it beats driving around to the store.<p>At the same time, if something is available at roughly the same price (can be a little more) at a local store, I would just as soon pick it up in person and avoid the shipping delay.  Essentially, I&#x27;m willing to pay a little more for fast delivery but I&#x27;m just as willing to pay a little more for the &quot;instant gratification&quot; of just being able to go pick the thing up.<p>The main difference I&#x27;ve found is that lots of physical retail stores often don&#x27;t have what I want or their online inventory system is unreliable so something will show as in stock locally but when I go to the actual store, it&#x27;s nowhere to be found.  Shopping online (for me) is often more about finding the exact item I want than it is about saving a few bucks by ordering direct.<p>Recent example:  a friend wanted me to build him a new desktop PC for general use and for gaming.  Maybe 5 years ago I&#x27;d have gone straight to Newegg because no retail location would have the selection of parts needed to build the best PC I could build within his budget.  But now we have a Microcenter nearby and while smaller components (cables, RAM, etc) might cost a few dollars more per item, they sell CPUs at a sizable discount as loss leaders so the total build is roughly equal to the Newegg price plus shipping cost.  In that case, it&#x27;s nicer to just go to the store, compare stuff like build quality of computer cases in person, get everything home that day (no shipping wait), and have a local place where I can go if something turns out to be defective.  No waiting for lengthy RMA shipping delays, just an hour on a Saturday to stop in and swap something out.<p>So I guess from a customer&#x27;s perspective, retail is still a good option and worth some level of cost premium as long as selection is good and I can verify that the items I want are in stock.  The other bit I haven&#x27;t mentioned is access.  In the case of Microcenter, I just walk in, grab a cart, and pick up all of my parts.  When I just bought an iPhone to replace my girlfriend&#x27;s older model, I ordered direct from Apple rather than going to the Apple store.  Apple store would&#x27;ve had the phone in my hand on the same day but it is located in a shopping mall.  I really, really hate going to that shopping mall because it means driving around a parking garage and then navigating floors of shops and escalators and crowds in order to get to the Apple store.  I&#x27;ll totally wait a day or two for shipping if it means I don&#x27;t need to step foot in the mall.",1446477574

36398,comment,36365,36365,0,0,zach,,,"It's great that there's some movement in this market.  I used to keep a work log of all the little problems I ran into so I could remember how I fixed them and analyze my effectiveness.  From there I started doing full spreadsheet time logs, but it's just plain difficult to keep up.  Technology that makes this unobtrusive is very much needed -- I considered making a Google widget just for my own use but it was clearly unproductive to do so!\n",1185299562

Come to think of it, does anyone know of any examples where strong network effect was broken, and how?  Not just in the online world, either (although it seems network effect in the offline world is only broken through war).",1185299142

36390,comment,36276,36359,0,0,euccastro,,,"Thanks for the advice.  <p>If you mean doing contract/consulting work, I'm not interesting in that at this point.  As for close interaction with customers, I can't agree more.  I learned that lesson the hard way as an user interface programmer for a persistent online game.  We got most of our feedback on the game forums, and game players are very opinionated customers.  It was so much better to talk directly to them rather than being mediated by game designers. And <i>definitely</i> better than implementing in a vacuum only to find out later that what you did is not what they wanted.",1185298569

It seems passive products (Last.FM, targeted ads, RescueTime, etc) instead of active products (Every application that only performs its functions only when you interact with it) could become pretty big.

I've been in a startup before [PS: As early employee; I can see how things can get even more emotional with founders], and I have seen and participated in spectacular clashes.

36386,comment,36152,36338,0,0,Leon,,,"	I was trying to spark conversation along a different line of dialog, but maybe I have been misunderstood.  Yes, this new ad system is a great idea - instant feedback and better, more specific targeting for individual websites and viewers, and any ad/marketing group should love it.  Yet a certain amount of unpredictability remains, especially for ad click-through rates, and it is this that I wanted to follow.<p>	Right now, it is relatively easy for a company to sign up for an online advertising service with some minimal guaranteed ad views.  From that companies can project future earnings based on their click through and purchase rates, even if their ads are terrible, and nobody except for 0.1% click, they at least have a base line for money coming in that is fairly reliable.  This system, however bad for the end users experience, is extremely helpful for the businesses planning and forecasting.  Now, the CFO can say, 'We're going to have at least this much money!', and Net Ops groups can say, 'Well that means we'll probably need this much bandwidth!', and the entire business can some-what get along.<p>	Then, Adpinion steps in.  Suddenly, Advertising/Marketing can't predict how much, or even if, they'll be able to meet previous projections, projections are useless at this point.  Now the CFO can't say if the company will be able to meet market predictions, and the Net Ops guys will be in the dark about if they'll suddenly be crushed by users' bandwidth requests or that they've over allocated bandwidth and they're now stuck with some fat pipes that are just getting spam messages.  Well, this is all a little dire, but the point is that Adpinion can create contentions in a business.<p>	Ah!  But here is what I wanted to follow through on - even if Adpinion can create unpredictability in long running advertising strategies, the real win here would be for a one-two punch with traditional online advertising venues.  A business could market test half their advertising revenue, find what works and then send it through traditional online ad streams.  Now that business can up their average click rate by quickly market testing ads, and they can make their advertising team hungry and on-edge about what how well that day/week/months' ad scheme performed.  And this is where Adpinion wins, for me.  From an overall business perspective, outside of a localized ad/marketing department, it would provide such a benefit to any company that they would be senseless not to use it.\n",1185297830

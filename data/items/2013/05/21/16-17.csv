On one hand you have the elected leader of one of the most populous regions in Canada, representing more people than many of the premiers do. He lacks the credibility and leadership to even directly address the accusations, instead hiding behind a single-word shrug off.<p>The (alleged) dealers are being opportunistic with what is potentially a very valuable asset. They're acting pretty exactly as you'd expect. Unless you spend all your time outraged that drug dealers exist, it makes more sense to be outraged that the mayor is stalling instead of responding.",1369155586
5745000,comment,5744224,5744224,3,0,corresation,,,"As the author of one of the ""negative"" comments yesterday -- <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5738748"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5738748</a> -- I'll scurry out of the bomb shelter long enough to offer a counterpoint.<p>I view this entry as a bit of a tantrum, by someone who cares so little about the comments on Hacker News that he has repeatedly slandered the site and its regulars, and while encouraging others to post this very link in a comment earlier today simultaneously demands that this site not link to him. This strikes me as a little childish and bizarre for someone who, as I think we all know, understands a bit about the internet.<p>He is attempting to bully a group, using tactics more commonly found in grade school, and is threatening to cancel recess for everyone.<p>If you are a public figure, which Winer is for his contributions to the industry, ""you"" become bigger than the person. You become a message bus and a context. That comes with a lot of benefits, which includes that every opinion gets broadly spread regardless of merit, but it also means that context becomes a legitimate target for criticism, and a persistent wrapper around all messages, <i>because</i> your opinions are broadly spread regardless of specific merit. It is not reasonable to demand that each message be evaluated outside of that context.<p>And I'll reword what I wrote yesterday to fit this particular entry, which is that many of his posts have become deeply depressing. Many follow the pattern of aggrieved entitlement and disenfranchisement (and to repeat what I said yesterday, fit the bigoted stereotype about older developers. As one of the only people who even mentioned age -- and as a <i>40 year old developer</i> -- I find it bizarre if Dave thought that was an insult about his age, when in reality it was a comment about him seemingly veering towards becoming the cliche).<p>It is fantastic that he is working on new, interesting stuff, but the message that percolates out continues to be rather morose.",1369155582

5744982,comment,5744224,5744710,2,0,grey-area,,,"There are different standards for public discourse; you should try to conform to the rules laid down by the community we're in, not impose your own standards on others. Also, given that Dave Winer reads and posts here, you could think of your posts as talking about him in a room when he's present. <i>Perhaps you would moderate your tone and insults a little if he were actually present?</i> This sort of incivility is what destroys a community, drives off positive contributions, and lets the trolls take over (see 4chan, reddit, kuro5hin), so I'd urge you to reconsider your use of such a hostile tone in public. There's nothing wrong with criticism, but making it personal, name calling and condemning someone as 'toxic' is not what I've come to expect here - frankly I'd expect better.<p>As to the upvotes you received, I suspect this happens mostly because there is no downvote on articles, and people use upvoting the first negative comment they see as a quick and easy substitute to announce their disagreement with the article in question, or even the title if they haven't read the article. I'm not sure I'd see upvotes as validation of your views, tempting as it is to do so. I've come to think voting either way here on HN should subtract karma, to make people really think about their decision to upvote and stop the flamebait and snarky comments floating to the top.",1369155487

All signs pointed to me likely being a very good one. In doing so, I would have gone to work and done my best to save lives every day. In that context, how is some programming environment a greater contribution to the world? Truthfully, it wouldn't be if I just set out to build an IDE. But that's not what I did - Light Table is just a vehicle for the real goal. While an IDE probably won't directly save someone's life, the things people are able to build with it could do exactly that.</i><p>To your main point:<p><i>If a new ""text editor"" ends up providing us a much more efficient means of creating things like Watson, in what way is that not just as important as curing any one disease?</i><p>Absolutely. I'm not arguing its importance, I'm arguing its effectiveness at achieving a <i>mission</i>, which I interpreted as curing cancer / saving lives. If you ""increase everything by 1%"", that is fantastic! And it has furthered many different missions 1% closer to their goals. This is very much important and necessary to the advancement of society, but its mission specifically should be put into context.<p>A microscope is a fundamental tool to help scientists do their best work. Thus, a person setting out to build one, in my opinion, has the opportunity to profoundly impact science's understanding of the human body and the world we live in. This understanding, further, can help scientists achieve <i>their</i> missions of curing disease, et cetera. But while the microscope plays a very important role in science, I believe it is unfair to the scientists for the microscope maker to believe that he is accomplishing his mission of curing disease by inventing one. Rather, he should be achieving his mission of helping our understanding of science, and/or furthering the missions of his users.",1369155441

I remember that 1800 Flowers and Rockport were offering discounts to customers that used Buy with Wallet, but this doesn't seem very successful by the lack of top merchants that aren't adopting it (even when there is a financial incentive like when Google funded the discounts for Rockport and 1800 flowers). Yes all people that buy Android apps have a Google Wallet account, but they aren't using this account outside of the Android ecosystem.<p>The customer support for checkout just isn't there as well. It has always been via email and extremely slow. With Paypal if you do over 200k then you get a dedicated account manager and they always have phone support. It has always seemed like a product that they are trying to make solve a problem it isn't equipped to handle- like having Android developers setup a Google Checkout account in order to get paid.

Mailchimp's most profitable clients are corporations, who spend serious money with their corporate account. They might even have specific employees who are responsible for the company's login credentials.

They vet candidates to make sure they are respectful people with whom they themselves would get along and whom they think are going to be as respectful if not more respectful of their own property. At the end of the day, your long-term neighbors, people you apparently are fond of and trust have chosen to hand over the keys to their apartment to people they have decided to trust based on some criteria of their own choosing.

The actual, implied or imagined presence of others does have a positive impact on behavior.

Learning the syntax for Php or JavaScript isn't that easy.<p>On the other hand, anybody with some math experience already knows and understands what a function is. At least to these people, Haskell syntax is clearer because it more closely matches something they're already familiar with: defining functions by cases. Sure, if you use some weird operators from odd libraries, people won't be able to follow. But that's true of using odd libraries in any language: people won't inherently understand AbstractBeanFactories or __magic_names__ either!<p>Now, if you already have some programming experience and little math, it's a completely different story. Once you've seen one imperative language with loops, statements and variables, you've seen them all. But this says more about how similar they are them about how easy they are to understand without background.<p>The usual experience people have with teaching Haskell and Scheme is that it's actually <i>easier</i> for people without prior programming experience!

5744812,comment,5743580,5744324,19,0,rayiner,,,"Much of what we consider to be profitable, high-growth business is about taking advantage of market failures. E.g. the advertising industry that bankrolls the internet is basically about taking advantage of cognitive biases to get people to make irrational purchasing decisions. Part of the success of e-commerce is due to the heroic efforts of UPS, etc, in reducing the cost of shipping over the years to make e-tailing cheaper than brick and mortar retailing, but a big part is also arbitraging on state sales tax laws.<p>This is not a moral judgment (I'm too old to make moral judgments). Fact is that purely competitive markets suck because there is no money in them (there's no high growth startups in the dairy industry, even with extensive government subsidies to offset the effects of vicious competition). A good fraction of the opportunities to make money are based on things like arbitraging regulations or exploiting market failures. Much of the rest involves focusing on markets with little competition (either because it's new or because others don't have the skills to target them), but I think people underestimate how much activity is in the former bucket. E.g. with AirBnB: are they in business because nobody thought to do what they're doing before, or because people thought about it before but realized it was illegal?",1369154076

They jump to conclusions, some of which are very wrong.""<p>I think that is the nub of the issue. People who are genuinely curious about an issue try to find out more. I routinely upvote comments here on any subject that ask for more information or more sources on factual statements made in articles submitted to HN or factual statements made in comments. We don't all have the same background in life experience and formal education, and I often learn new facts about the world from other Hacker News participants. I can't always assume that I understand another person's comment on the first read. Moreover, quite a few participants here write English as a second language. (How many Americans can write in ANY language besides English?) So sometimes the first thing to do when replying to an article submitted to HN is to ask follow-up questions. Another good thing to do is to point to other sources, if you know of any, for more information.<p>Civility is a core value of Paul Graham, the founder of Hacker News. He wants us to be able to disagree politely<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a><p>when we do disagree, and the Hacker News welcome message<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html</a><p>distills the basic rules of the site into a simple statement: ""Essentially there are two rules here: don't post or upvote crap links, and don't be rude or dumb in comment threads.""<p>Don't be rude. Don't be mean. That's not easy, but that is the community guideline here. Or maybe not being mean or rude IS easy, if you practice it. It's worth finding out how much we could all habituate improving our social skills by how we behave here on Hacker News.<p>AFTER EDIT: It's worth pointing out that I wrote all of the above part of what I wrote before I really wrapped my mind around the fact that, after all, the submitted blog post comes from Dave Winer, whose blog posts I have been reading for more than a decade. I still stand by my statement that we may all as well be as civil as we possibly can and as factual as we possibly can here on Hacker News. This is a community we can all improve by our individual actions. That said, I think Dave Winer and plenty of other bloggers have plenty to learn from the best comment threads on Hacker News, the comment threads that most follow pg's aspirations for this site, precisely because there is a back-and-forth in the comments and a fact-checking that many bloggers shy away from. The difference between a blogger and a journalist is that a journalist is a reporter who writes for an editor. Sometimes bloggers write only for themselves, and when they do, they can learn from comments, if only they are willing to do so. When a blogger writes about another public figure, the blogger has to be able to take the heat, or maybe the blogger should find another kitchen.",1369153467

Don't bank on future promises.<p>Dave himself admits that he felt like he had a disincentive to enforce the future promises due to what he had already received as a result of the more immediate terms -- a contract is, ultimately, not just a set of promises, but a set of promises that the parties feel need to be backed by the threat of legal action to ensure compliance.<p>If, for any of those promises, you aren't going to be <i>willing</i> to act on that threat when they are violated, and the other party knows the incentive structure that makes you unwilling to act on the threat, well, then the threat is gone, and if you didn't need the threat to enforce the promises, you wouldn't have needed a contract in the first place.<p>That doesn't really mean there is a difference between short-term and longer-term promises, it means that there is a difference between promises backed by the credible threat of legal action and promises not backed by the credible threat of legal action, which is rather the <i>entire reason contracts exist in the first place</i>.",1369153163

We can call it other things if that's less offensive: petulant, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing, perhaps.

So is Dave.<p>Participating in a technology doesn't afford a permanent apotheosis to all of one's self and works. Your words must still carry their own water.

We can be selective in our audience, we can dole out our rhetoric with caution and precision.<p>Or we can blast that shit out to the whole of the world.<p>Now, Dave is quite excited to tell us how he helped make such a feat possible. And the consequence of his great work is we all get to talk about it. And sometimes we're not going to agree.<p>Sometimes we're not going to worship.<p>And that's life.<p>I take the point very well that HN comments can be pretty toxic.

5744601,comment,5744128,5744369,9,0,jeremymcanally,,,"Several people seem to be under the impression that the actually information in books isn't worth very much, and unfortunately, I think we have publishers to blame for that.  Books, as they are priced on Amazon for example, are not priced to make the author any profit.  They are priced to benefit the publisher.  The vast, vast majority of that low price goes towards the publishers ethereal and rarely specified ""costs"" (plus, they absorb about 80-90% of the profits typically).  They can price things at such a low price because they make up for it in volume.  Their costs actually go way down as volume goes up.  Printing is much cheaper, especially if they're sending a steady stream of work to a particular printer.  Editing costs don't scale linearly in most agencies.  Support costs definitely don't scale linearly.  So they can spread their costs around to several different projects and still make a boatload of money.<p>Independent authors, who are trying to actually make somewhat of a living off of their works, do not have such luxuries.  They are the editing department.  They are the typesetting department.  They are their support department.  They're doing all these things with no benefits of economies of scale whatsoever.  So it costs more.  This is also why academic presses tend to cost more, too, because they're operating on a much smaller scale.<p>I can appreciate the desire for a physical book.  I, too, prefer dead trees.  Some of my own readers prefer it too (and for some reason think for $12 [or less], they'll get it), but in reality you have to realize that in paying $39 or $69 for that PDF, you're paying for a lot more hours of work from one person, costs that aren't spread across an entire business like a publisher, and that money is going directly to the author who is providing the product, which means it's <i>probably</i> (not always) going to be of a higher quality and a better purchasing experience (i.e., you could likely e-mail Nathan with a question and get a reasonable response).<p>Also, the scale of marketing for an independent author is much smaller.  It's simply impossible to negotiate with the bigger players for shelf space, and it's not profitable to invest in tons of streams of marketing typically.  So, you're left to target the niches you're writing for the best you can and hope it works out in your favor.  I've had fabulous successes ($50k+++) and horrible flops (< $1,000 for a lot of work).  A lot of that is because it's difficult to saturate the general market and get them interested in your work.  Very rarely will someone come over your book and say ""Oh hey I've heard about Rails [or whatever].  I'll buy that."" because most people aren't browsing the Internet using Google's ""I'm Feeling Lucky.""  So for most indie authors who <i>aren't</i> selling like Nathan, the higher price is needed to justify the investment of effort into the book.<p>So, that wall of text is to say: please think about the person behind the book and the effort they're putting into it when you look at the price tag.  Obviously, they want to make money.  They're not pricing it to give it away.  But likewise, they're also [probably] trying to feed a family and keep writing more books.",1369152481

It ignores the fact that the ad was likely shot by an expensive professional with additional expensive lighting equipment and a staff of assistants. When a customer starts to think ""All I need is a nice camera, and I can do that too!"", you've got an uphill battle when it comes to educating customers about the value of a professional.<p>On HN, I'd bet that many of us have probably encountered people who have read or seen books with titles like ""Learn HTML in 2 hours"" or ""Learn iOS programming in 7 days"" and think that spectacular apps and sites can be created with little to no effort.",1369152232

Yes you are intrigued by the headline and promise at the top of the landing page. But you are also internalizing to find reasons not to buy because you don't trust the author yet.

But as long as the quality of my posts doesn't degrade (flame wars do that) I think 1 per day is fine.<p>I think we, as a group, tend to be shitty judges of character, but our arrogance blinds us to the need for improvement. We're cynical about ""people"" in general, but we latch on too quickly to businesspeople who seem above-the-fray or decent, often based on superficial signals. (This is like the creepy guy who fabricates a relationship with a girl because she smiles at him.)<p>A consequence of this is that we can't perceive it when we the people above us play divide-and-conquer games against us. Language wars. This team against that team. IDE-users vs. command-line developers. Efficient but ""not dedicated"" 8-to-6 family guys vs. inefficient all-nighter types. Pro-Google vs. anti-Google. Facebook users vs. Facebook haters. Young vs. old. We've all been monstrously played and most of us don't even see it.<p>Your enemy isn't the guy who wrote the shitty code. He was quite possibly working under an obscene deadline in a job he couldn't afford to lose. No, the enemy is the boss who mandates you use the shitty code (using the nicest possible language, i.e. ""we won't be able to deliver unless <horrible technical compromise that damages your career>"") instead of letting you rewrite it; when he makes a common enemy out of the original architect, he's fucking playing you.<p>Most of our road-wear that we get in this career comes from wrong assumptions we make when divide-and-conquer games are played against us. We eventually wise up to the bad character of the players, but we retain those biases for a long time, and start saying things like ""every shop I know of that used the JVM (<i>N</i> = 1) was unable to hire good people""... when the real reason that shop couldn't hire talent was that it paid poorly.<p>Just what I've seen. All this incivility and in-fighting comes out of our willingness to tear each other apart based on superficial differences, and that's something that's been inculcated in us from above. Why? Because we're fucking easy to control that way.",1369152143
5744566,comment,5744224,5744224,10,0,jmduke,,,"This is tricky.<p>On one hand, Hacker News, despite being one of the best of its kind, is a programming community, and programming communities (or similarly populated communities: online gaming, etc.) are possibly the most overwhelmingly negative and vitriolic I find online. (Huge exception: StackExchange.)  I find it perplexing that the business & finance communities I visit are consistently more civil and constructive.  Remember the developer who got flamed for creating (not promoting or arguing the superiority of, merely posting on GitHub) an sed/awk replacement?  Our community is an overwhelmingly mean one at times.<p>(You can dress it up as engineers/developers/hackers being more honest, more blunt, less MBA-y, whatever.  It's unpleasant and hurts people's feelings.)<p>On the other hand, in the midst of all the ad hominem of yesterday's discussion (you can find it here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5738455"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5738455</a>) there was a lot of valid commentary which Dave Winer (whom, for the record, I have never talked to nor do I know his accomplishments) seemed to ignore.  The reasonable extrapolation from <i>My One Talk with Marissa Mayer</i> was that Winer felt she was an individual whom did not respect developers' viewpoints or a more 'balanced' view of the web. Specifically, he says:<p><i>All this is to say that the promises execs make on acquisitions are meaningless. They own the thing, they will do what they want to with it. It doesn't matter how many nice sounds Mayer makes on the deal. At the core she cares not one bit what the users of Tumblr think. She's saying what she needs to say to make the deal happen. To avoid a PR crisis on Day One. To make the team at Tumblr feel like their work has value to the new owners. That somehow this acquisition isn't actually an acquisition.</i><p>And I think it's entirely valid to say that, hey, isn't it a massive logical leap to get here from the anecdote of the 'BlogThis!"" button?<p>Winer seems to be asking Hacker News to be polite, which I think is important: but I think it's better that Hacker News is <i>good</i>, and along the way it seems obvious that being polite is better than not being impolite.",1369152136

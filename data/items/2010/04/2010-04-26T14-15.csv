1294989,comment,1294419,1294674,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"The halfway ""best of both worlds"" is impossible to attain, in my opinion. As far as I understand it, dynamic typing (meaning, extensive usage of runtime type information) has unmatched flexibility. Static typing (meaning, extensive analysis of syntactic types at compile time) completely prevent large classes of errors.<p>If you want a middle ground, you may lose some of the flexibility, and you still won't be able to prove as much as a full static type system. In the end, the ""best of both world"" could rapidly become the <i>worst</i> of both worlds.<p>As I see it, we have to compromise. When you design a type system, you want to maximize 3 virtues: flexibility, simplicity, and error sensitiveness. Alas, of these 3, you can only have 2. Dynamic type systems typically are simple and flexible, but hardly prove anything (which explain why unit tests are so useful). Advanced type systems like Haskell's are quite flexible and prevent many errors, but they are complex. Others, like Java's, are simpler but not as flexible (nor as error proof). And of course you have horrible type systems, like C++'s, which lacks all 3 virtues.",1272293513

The fundamental problem with the whole ""blub"" argument is that there isn't one linear continuum of language power. There are problems for which Erlang's supervision hierarchy and distribution primitives or Prolog's backtracking are a killer feature. This doesn't mean they're ""More Powerful than Lisp"", just better suited to certain kinds of problems because they committed to some very specific trade-offs.<p>But, these same trade-offs have far-reaching implications for the language semantics, so you can't just use macros to graft them on after the fact. You can embed a mini-Prolog in Lisp, sure, but adding fully native logic variables (as in Prolog or Oz) would be far from trivial.",1272292492

My bad, really.<p>To clear things up regarding Facebook and the original link as well, I should explain that I have a really hard time believing what the original poster says about their ads. It might very well be that a lot of people fail to use them in a meaningful way because they haven't thought through what makes Facebook advertisement unique. I am certain that a sizeable fraction of the ad market can and will exploit them, and especially the infinitely granular targeting.<p>My experience as a user is a bit mixed (lots of crap and/or scam, and thankfully less and less social games silliness as I've downvoted it), but I've seem true gems too (job ads targeting my university + degree + class, pretty neat! -- or a nice ad campaign by Hulu in its early days that targeted a show I had just listed as one of my interests). All in all, the future of FB is pretty bright in my book.<p>Edit:
Also, I should point out that I do not think at all that Facebook's business has anything fraudulent, improper or immoral. My original post (second from the top) was just trying to explain why someone who held the post's author's views on FB ads could believe the company was fundamentally instable and depended on perpetual growth for survival. I personally don't agree with this view, and think they'll be just fine -- and apparently I'm not alone: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/20/facebook-valued-at-14-billion-on-secondmarket/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/20/facebook-valued-at-14-billi...</a>",1272290921

But that approach has its own disadvantages - if one arrives at the bottom of programming language constructs, working 'upwards' is a problem.<p>Take for example the argument lists: Common Lisp has things like keywords, optional and rest arguments. Plain Scheme only has rest arguments. Adding other argument interpretation is possible, but is only really use if the language would support it and would make use of it.",1272290824

It&#x27;s much cheaper to catch ill defined requirements while planning on paper than once the constraints reach production and people start implementing features and tests based on them. Although you cannot plan _everything_ there is always _something_ you can plan - and should plan. Unless you have a spec or a plan at day 0, you do not have a documentation platform available when the shit invariably does hit the fan and you need to do the learning-organization-disco and facilitate a change to your product because some real world constraints were not known or acknowledged before hand.",1394528389

If I interpret what you want correctly, you basically want a cert that is dual-signed by multiple CAs which would be under different political jurisdictions. It&#x27;s a clever idea, but it&#x27;s not really usable. Clients validate that they trust <i>a</i> member in the signing chain, not <i>all</i> members in the signing chain, so as soon as the browser encounters a signing authority that it trusts, it will trust the cert.<p>Furthermore, this wouldn&#x27;t really stop a bad actor from getting a cert signed by a third CA which your browser trusts and MITMing it to you, unless you&#x27;re cert pinning, which practically nobody is because it comes with a tremendous list of user experience issues.",1394528374

They do not cope with stress as well as men, and emotionally degrade with fatigue at a far faster rate than males. When distressed, they become irritable, combative and irrational more often than men when in high stress situations (their emotions escalate more quickly).<p>I disagree with both of those claims.

For what other reason there are Agile consultants, Agile agencies and Agile certification.<p>I firmly believe that Agile is about doing what makes sense in this team right now. You let the team to decide on their process, on their way of work and get away. And for good managers this is enough - you are empowering your team to succeed.<p>Recently I had a great success demolishing standups in our team. We clearly weren&#x27;t getting enough value from them (I though they were plainly hurting us), so it was time for change. I had a great resistance from the management team, but some developers were keen to try a change (some of them were long enough in the industry to remember the pre-agile days, when we were delivering software too). So we tried it for some time, everybody loved it, and we stopped doing it completely.<p>Now days we all agree that iterative development is the way forward. We should also think if we can apply the same on a meta level - the team, the process, the product, the design, the organization. Do small steps, check if you are going into the right direction, repeat. It may work :)",1394528346

7378093,comment,7377915,7377915,2,0,mcv,,,"Outsourcing has its fair share if disadvantages. It happens a lot, mind you; not remotely every company has its own IT department, builds its own website, etc. But if it&#x27;s part of your core business, you probably want some direct control over it and not be at the mercy of other companies. And that means hiring the right expertise.<p>Whether to outsource or not is an important strategic decision that depends on how important the task is to your core business, what kind of expertise you&#x27;ve got in house, and how well you can guarantee the quality of that expertise. But in the right circumstances, having this in your own company gives you more control at a lower cost than if you outsource it.<p>Then there&#x27;s offshoring, of course, which is outsourcing to a cheaper country. This was popular 10 years ago because from a management perspective, because of the lower cost per hour, it seemed to be cheaper. But if it takes more time, you lose that advantage. Most companies have finally come to understand that offshoring means you import a big communication overhead, and you hand over quite a lot of control over the quality of the project to a party that is not always capable of delivering the quality you need.

Are you going to store it on disk as a binary? It surely saves time on rebuilding it and B-Trees can get big, their whole advantage against normal BSTs being that they are more optimal in case their size exceeds the available RAM, so they are meant for being stored. However, the B-Tree itself is not the actual data. It&#x27;s just an index. You don&#x27;t care much about losing it, since you can always rebuild it out of the data that it indexes. And most importantly, you aren&#x27;t going to use Protobuf to store it ;-)<p>What about the actual data? If it&#x27;s a database, like a RDBMS, well it&#x27;s a black box and it&#x27;s the norm to store things as binary blobs, again for efficiency, but if you haven&#x27;t followed the trail of people that have had problems migrating their binary storage between different versions of the same RDBMS, or recovering from backups, let me tell you, it ain&#x27;t nice. Which is why you can&#x27;t speak of having backups unless you&#x27;re doing regular SQL dumps. And most importantly, you aren&#x27;t going to store anything using Protobuf ;-)<p>What about unstructured data, like terabytes of log lines? Now this is where it gets interesting, as unstructured data is the real source of it all in systems that collect and aggregate data from various streams. You end up storing it, because it&#x27;s simply <i>data</i> that you may want to parse at some point. Are you going to store that as binary blobs like with Protobuf? You could do that, but it would be your biggest mistake ever, as that data will <i>outlive</i> your software or any of the current business logic, plus the format will evolve a lot ;-)<p>As for API communications and protocols, I&#x27;m unconvinced that something like Protobuf brings performance benefits over plain JSON and I mentioned in another comment that I do have experience and have done comparisons with various bidding exchanges that were sending tens of thousands of requests per second our way. Maybe at a Google-like scale it brings benefits, but for the rest of us it&#x27;s a nuisance.",1394527479
7378070,comment,7367046,7377772,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"The elements of the crime are:<p>1. You are &quot;in&quot; a matter subject to the jurisdiction of any branch of the US government.<p>2. You knowingly (and willfully) make a false statement.<p>The entity your statement is directed to is not mentioned. We have cases of convictions under section 1001 for making knowing false statements to someone who was known <i>not</i> to be a government agent. As a side note, I was fairly explicit in my earlier comment, saying &quot;there is no requirement that you be aware of any information concerning the person you&#x27;re lying to&quot;; it would have been nice if you&#x27;d indicated your disagreement then. Again, the object of your deceit is not even mentioned in the law.<p>As to your second point, I haven&#x27;t said that section 1001 defines a strict liability offense (for example, if I lie to investigators in the belief that what I&#x27;m saying is true, mens rea would be hard to show). I&#x27;m saying that the way this law is defined conflicts with the <i>concept</i> behind mens rea (compare my prior words, &quot;this spits in the face of the mens rea concept&quot;), in that liability can attach to you based on facts you couldn&#x27;t have known (though you&#x27;ll still have &quot;mens rea&quot; in that you knew you were lying).<p>To the third point, if speaking to an agent of the government is not an element of the crime (and since you can be convicted without having spoken to an agent of the government, that seems likely), it&#x27;s hard to see why the prosecution would have to prove that you knew you were speaking to one.<p>The fact that a conviction hasn&#x27;t occurred under a particular set of facts does not address my complaint of overcriminalization. I just spent dozens of words arguing that criminal statutes cover, in their inappropriate breadth, much more conduct than they should, including conduct that &quot;most&quot; would agree should not be covered at all. This kind of thing, where prosecutors could go after anyone but <i>choose</i> to go after the politically unpopular (lest their power to pursue anyone be taken away), is a terrible development. If you think a conviction under those facts would be so ridiculous... is it ridiculous enough that we should remove it from the reach of that law?<p>Remember, the fact that a conviction with unusual facts has never occurred doesn&#x27;t block you from suffering the full penalty when you become the first person to fit the pattern. If you can be convicted under section 1001 for lying to known non-government-agents, and you can be convicted for lying to known government agents in a proceeding you weren&#x27;t aware of, you can be convicted of lying to unknown government agents in a proceeding you weren&#x27;t aware of.<p>I would be interested in such discussion on Volokh as you cared to bring to my attention; searching the site for &quot;18 USC 1001&quot; brought up a lot of mentions but no discussions (that I found).",1394527399

It should read &quot;You should have a plan but should rather be prepared to change it constantly than stick with it dogmatically&quot;.<p>I would say that when you are within a project team it should emphasize the agile values but once you are on an organizational level where several project teams need to co-operate to deliver a product the constraints given to teams should be formalized over the right hand side, strongly, but in a way that is ready to take immediate feedback from the realities. Preferably, my dream system would be formed of strong spec based contracts between teams, enforced by automatic tools and architects, who work as part of feature teams implementing features and have the ownership of the spec-framework and can swiftly change it to respond to changes.<p>Completely forgoing specs and plans leads to anarchy and headache where the only two-channel communication with developers is facilitated by broken unit tests and system-test or (the horror) customer side regressions.<p>Good software systems are composed through a firmly kept set of as strong constraints as possible, IMO, and someone needs to own the constraints.",1394526995

I also welcome opposing viewpoints with explanations. I am merely providing some of the reasons that men are hired above women. This does not necessarily represent my personal viewpoints, I am playing devils advocate in some cases here.<p>><i>The economist Larry Summers famously suggested once that so few women become scientists and engineers because of discrimination, preference and even differences in innate ability.</i><p>Ability? There are many teenage prodigies who become homeless and total failures in life. Who ever thought that ability alone guarantees anything? This is a flawed and narrow minded mentality.<p>Does anyone ever stop and think that there may be more logical reasons than ability that men are hired above women?<p>There are probably thousands of reasons that men get hired in front of women. Here are some (many of which are not politically correct) facts. As derived by science, statistics, and surveys. I am only echoing information based on research and experience (as a HR specialist for 15 years). These are generalities and certainly don&#x27;t apply to all women and all men.<p>Women are generally less ambitious (even if they had better grades). Less creative problem solvers, and less logical (more emotional) with their decisions. Most of them lack the strong drive that men have for career advancement and success. Many men relentlessly work toward advancement and achievement despite having to make sacrifices such as family time, and other obstacles. Much of this is because of the role of testosterone and the design of the male brain (for competition and dominance). I am not saying that there are no women who are ambitions. I am just saying that the ratio is highly in favor of men here. I mentioned the testosterone part because many of you will respond that it is only that women have not been given the proper chance and thus the difference. This has been dis-proven by science and statistical studies.<p>Most women at some point get pregnant and have kids. This (moderately to severely depending on the person) affects their productivity and mood while pregnant (9 months). Afterward they are off work for 4-6 months (or potentially much longer if the newborn has health problems). The women cannot be legally replaced during this time. Her job has to be waiting there for her when (and if) she eventually comes back. When she does come back, women miss far more work than men to take care of sick kids. This all puts a company in a difficult position (financially and otherwise) that does not exist for men.<p>Women miss work more often than men because of personal illness and depression.<p>Women are far less amenable to overtime and don&#x27;t perform well in crunch situations. They do not cope with stress as well as men, and emotionally degrade with fatigue at a far faster rate than males. When distressed, they become irritable, combative and irrational more often than men when in high stress situations (their emotions escalate more quickly).<p>Women&#x27;s hormones fluctuate at a far higher rate and frequency, often affecting their moods, concentration, and productivity. Estrogen causes emotional instability and fluctuation. Men have little estrogen and don&#x27;t experience the peaks and valleys that women do. Women are more likely to form clicks and ostracize, other women among other social problems. Women just don&#x27;t get along with women quite often. It causes a real distraction for everyone and hurts workplace morale.<p>Women (attractive ones) are a distraction to many men. I am generally not blaming women for this, but it is a fact. Men will spend time talking to a pretty female employee just because. Workplace relationship that may form are often disastrous. When the relationship ends, a real mess ensues.<p>Men can and do occasionally (some men more than occasionally) talk dirty when women aren&#x27;t around. You have a women around and men have to watch everything they say. They can&#x27;t say t__s or b__bs out loud. That could land them in the unemployment line because of a sexual harassment complaint.<p>Men have been in charge since the beginning of time. They have leadership built into their DNA. They see women as trying to encroach on that and being the competitors that they are - don&#x27;t want extra competition. This is natural.<p>Political correctness and &quot;equality&quot;. Wither you are are for or against them, are not natural, logical or intuitive. Men thinking that men should be selected above women in tech/science because as a whole, they posses more natural skills and posses less natural challenges is logically the best bet. There are instances where a women will outperform a man, but statistically the odds are against this happening by a large scale.<p>Edit: here are a couple more statistics:\nWomen are more likely to quit a job.\nWomen are more likely to exit the workforce altogether.<p>There are a number of books rationalizing gender based wage and hiring inequality that point out far more statistics and logical (cause and effect) reasoning than I have mentioned here. I will try to dig up a couple.",1394526418

If I watch the Vera UI after sending the command, it times out and retries several times before giving up. Yet other times it works, but usually only after at least one retry. The hub isn&#x27;t too far from the door, and there&#x27;s no walls in-between. The unreliability of z-wave stuff is my biggest problem with it.<p>The Nest responds pretty much instantly to commands despite them having to go out to the internet then back. The unofficial APIs provide access to everything the device and its web/mobile apps can do. Same with my Belkin WeMo switches and sensors -- you&#x27;re probably not a fan of WeMo either, but I&#x27;m a fan of them responding instantly and speaking UPnP.<p>The divide between these products isn&#x27;t really about &quot;tinkerers vs non-tinkerers&quot;. If that was it, Nest/WeMo/etc would win over the monoprice z-wave stuff any day. They&#x27;re much easier to hack with (no extra hardware required, HTTP APIs, open source libraries readily available) and typically do a lot more than the generic single-function devices.<p>The divide you&#x27;ve set up is around privacy and external dependency. The tradeoffs there aren&#x27;t the same, and not everyone&#x27;s going to agree with you on that either, even hackers with full knowledge. I don&#x27;t necessarily think self-hosted and self-supported APIs are a better future. That&#x27;s a future that would limit a lot of the cool stuff you can do with these devices to us, instead of making it available to everyone. Most of the coolest stuff in our homes today already relies on entrusting a certain amount of control and information to 3rd parties, from your electric company, to your ISP, to the makers of all the set-top boxes connected to your TV, to the phone in your pocket. All of these things involve giving up tons of data and control of your home.<p>I have no problem with &quot;smart thing&quot; makers hosting APIs so long as they remain trustworthy with that data, and reliable, which is not a huge ask. I&#x27;m a lot more confident Google can run Nest&#x27;s API reliably and securely than Vera staying in business and keeping its P.O.S. MiOS functioning.",1394526170

IMHO the author overvalues the class/inheritance part of OOP and discards the considerable risks posed by using it. For example in the case of the self-binding he misuses inheritance to express &quot;a Class with SelfBinding&quot; which is a strategy/trait relationship and inheritance is the absolutely wrong hammer for that screw. A simple function would be less intrusive, have less indirection, and be more flexible.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not sure self-binding is part of ES6, to address your actual question. self-binding introduces a certain overhead to every function call, so I&#x27;m not even sure it would be a good thing if it would.",1394525973

They let you define rich DSLs. Unfortunately, application of their most powerful features to any given problem domain typically results in a custom language specific to that domain - so much so that you lose much of the benefits of sharing a language with other programmers. Understanding what&#x27;s going on takes much more work, because you need to understand more of the system before its gestalt becomes clear.<p>DSLs are excellent when they&#x27;re applied to problem domains that are otherwise very clumsy to express, when the problem is widespread, when it doesn&#x27;t intermix too deeply with other domains (i.e. the abstraction is mostly self-contained), and when there is a critical mass of programmers using it - enough that understanding the system at its own level of abstraction is enough for most people.<p>But when you apply the same techniques to relatively humdrum problems like object construction, function binding etc., it&#x27;s best if the language or its standard library has a reasonable approach and everybody uses it. Developing your own ad-hoc language around class construction means that everyone coming into your code needs to understand it before they can truly understand what the code is doing. It&#x27;s a barrier to understanding, and the pros of customization need to be substantially higher than the costs of subtlety.<p>In short, it&#x27;s usually better to be explicit.",1394524976

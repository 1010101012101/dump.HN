9025460,comment,9022797,9022797,0,0,devnonymous,,,"This is cool !!<p>I&#x27;ve had this idea for a while now -- I do not like FB because I do not trust them, same is true of G+ ..etc. but my &#x27;network&#x27; prefers them and that&#x27;s how content is shared and propagated for a while now. So, I&#x27;ve been thinking what I would like is a &#x27;client-side&#x27; social network platform where sharing of status, photos, messages ...what-have-you would be from /within/ the client. Basically, you add a set of friends and create a network of your own, pretty much like FB/twitter..etc but the main difference being that you (ie: your browser) &#x27;hosts&#x27; all of the content out of your hard disk. If my friends run the same client, content is served out of their hard disks as well seamlessly and travels to the network without first going thru&#x27; someone else&#x27;s server ...like you know ..p2p. The operative word of course being seamlessly[1].<p>This way content could be &#x27;shared&#x27; beyond your friends through the extended network based strictly on privacy settings that you can control.<p>I thought I&#x27;d implement this as a browser extension but then the design hits into hacky workaround territory when it comes to implementing the transfer.<p>This barrier of entry is now low if/when such a http server becomes part of FireFox OS. With this functionality, I could in theory server my phone (or whatever device Firefox OS runs on) with all its pics, music, videos, etc through my network who only need a browser and an address that&#x27;ll point to my app.<p>Interesing. I might just revive my efforts to build this.<p>[1] Yeah, I know I just re-invented the web/self-hosted domains/dnydns+webserver -- but the idea here is, it would all be &#x27;built-in&#x27; into an app/extension.",1423544349

(1) Python-Flask

(6) Bootstrap<p>In my second company we wanted to take advantage of the growing ecosystem around Node. We also did not want to have to manage a DB, migrations, and server scripts. Our rationale is that we should focus more on the customer and turning the customer requirements into the product than on the technology working. We are an enterprise software company and so the less complicated the technology the better since we are not doing anything ground breaking from a technology standpoint. Our stack includes:
(1) NodeJS/Express
(2) Heroku
(3) Angular JS (I don&#x27;t get all the negative comments about Angular lately because it works fine for us)
(4) Lodash (Javascript utilities)
(5) S3 - static file storage (images and files)
(6) Jquery
(7) Bootstrap
(8) Firebase
(9) Angular Fire (to connect firebase with angular)<p>Using our current backend, we were able to build the SAAS product in about 1 month with only myself as a developer instead of 2-4 months that might be required if we had used the previous technology stack.

An important point is that attackers tend to have better lists, because they are the ones stealing and cracking them, and these lists make them increasingly better at cracking passwords. Defenders use the lists for all sorts of analysis on how exactly users pick passwords.<p>For example, &quot;complex password policies&quot; have become increasingly popular. But do they actually increase the entropy of the chosen passwords? Surprisingly little, since users will &quot;defeat&quot; the policy by applying easy to guess &quot;munging rules&quot;. Humans being human and such. The thieves have the lists, and learn to apply the munging rules and defeat the policies. Researchers need these lists so they can discover the same weakness and try to react.<p>More recent research looks at things like how effective the password strength indicators are at actually helping users choose stronger passwords. We also learn about how users choose different strength passwords based on the sites they visit and such. This is absolutely fertile ground for research which can improve how we perform authentication.<p>Yet another good use of the lists is in defending against online attacks. E.g. Failed attempts that follow the general probability distribution of the lists are easier to identify as bots.<p>[1] - I think all the talks are posted, although I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a central archive, each conference is identified as Passwords^[Year], e.g. Passwords^14 <a href=""https://passwordscon.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://passwordscon.org/</a>",1423543287

At best, it introduces compatibility issues. This is essentially the history of HTML and browsers, each one needing to implement the same bugs as other popular versions.<p>SIP is another IETF gem, which takes its syntax from HTTP. And guess what? It&#x27;s impossible to have unambiguous parsing in the wild! Why? The whole liberal in what you accept bad idea. So A interprets \n as a line ending, even though the spec says \r\n. B interprets it another liberal way, and assumes you didn&#x27;t mean to transmit two newlines in a row, so it&#x27;ll keep reading headers. End result: you can bypass policy restrictions by abusing this liberal-ness and get A to approve a message that B will interpret in another way. Yikes. And, since the software for both is so widely deployed, there is little hope of solving the problem. In fact, the IETF essentially requires you to implement AI as you&#x27;re supposed to guess at the &quot;intent&quot; of a message.<p>So you&#x27;re sorta proving my point, that people are thinking &quot;oh it&#x27;s just text&quot; and then writing shitty, sloppy code, and they&#x27;re giddy cause it sorta worked, even from a two line shell script.

It is certainly the case that modern FP assumes copying is okay. This comes naturally from the &quot;structural properties&quot; of implication in type theory and there&#x27;s plenty of work studying type theories which are &quot;substructural&quot; and thus don&#x27;t assume an ambient copy/destroy comonoid. I don&#x27;t honestly consider this out of scope of FP, although no languages implement it today. There is a need to pick a &quot;default semantics sweet spot&quot; and linear logic may have not yet proven it pays its way on the weight/power tradeoff spectrum. But maybe it will be shown to in time?<p>In the mean time you can do plenty of work in abstract algebra without talking about mutation or destruction at all. You mention category theory but ignore the prime dictum of CT: it&#x27;s all about the arrows. Categories certainly exist which embody destructive internal algebras---CT would be pretty useless if it didn&#x27;t---but externally we consider arrows and compositions of arrows alone. This is where the real power of CT comes from anyway.",1423542731

In terms of rights negotiating their content suppliers are currently getting nothing from Cuba so will go for it without any discussions, so all Netflix needs to do is flick a switch in their control panel to allow IPs from Cuba and issue a press release.<p>Sure, even if 100% of Cuba&#x27;s broadbrand subscribers signed up it&#x27;s an insignificant amount to Netflix, but for the low cost they may well think of it as PR and/or marketing (and/or looking ahead to a day when maybe Cuba could give them enough revenue to care about - though seems unlikely to me), not just for ideological reasons.",1423541285

We do it every day.<p>The morality of it wasn&#x27;t evident to slave owners in the past, it seems. Like the morality of printing money isn&#x27;t evident to most nowadays.<p>I&#x27;m not going to defend gold specifically here because what matters is that there not be a group of people that can issue money. The problem with creating it out of thin air is precisely that some people will be in control of printing it, and will get corrupted by it, endangering the health of that system and of its participants.<p>I&#x27;m also not going to defend gold because someone that is against slavery need not defend and explain ad nauseam how machines will eventually take on agricultural work and blah blah blah. Slavery is immoral because it impinges on people&#x27;s freedoms. Same goes for printing money.<p>> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a country on the planet that will accept gold for financial transactions without converting to currency. So, no, it hasn&#x27;t &quot;lasted thousands of years&quot;; it&#x27;s gone.<p>You&#x27;re being intellectually dishonest. The world cared about gold until 1971.

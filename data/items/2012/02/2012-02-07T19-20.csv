All official media channels were controlled by the government and the only choices for opposition at that time had was to either get in bed with the Milosevic and reap some benefits or to organize rallies and protests. Protests were largely peaceful and lasted a long time. The main surge of protests that resulted in Milosevic's downfall was in the fall of 2000 but I can assure you we were in the streets for YEARS leading up to that.

3563402,comment,3562137,3562137,13,0,jfarmer,,,"Awesome!  I was just talking about this with a friend the other day.  My formal education is in mathematics, but I've been writing software since high school.<p>I wish Dan made his argument in a less pointed way, though.<p>The underlying question is this: what does education look like on the web?  Can every subject be taught there?<p>In design, a skeuomorph is a derivative object that retains some feature of the original object which is no longer necessary.  For example, iCal in OS X Lion looks like a physical calendar, even though there's no reason for a digital calendar to look (or behave) like a physical calendar.  The same goes for the address book.<p>This is what I see happening in online education.  I don't think it's a case of ""lol, Silicon Valley only trusts computers,"" but rather starting off by doing the most literal thing.<p>Textbooks?  Let's publish some PDFs online.  Lectures?  Let's publish videos online.  Homework and tests?  Let's make a website that works like a multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank test.<p>These are skeumorphs.  There's no reason for the online equivalent of a textbook to be a PDF, it's just the most obvious thing.<p>For me it's 1000x more interesting to ask ""On the web, what's the best way to do what a lecture does offline?"" than to say ""Khan Academy videos are the wrong way of doing it.""<p>I think sites like Codecademy point the way when it comes to programming.  The textbook is the IDE.<p>What does that look like for math?  It's much harder because, like Dan says, computers aren't the natural medium for mathematicians, so there will always be a translation step from math-ese to computer-ese.<p>Once you're past basic math and are working out of a higher-level textbook, the exercises becomes very awkward to express on a computer in a way a computer can understand.<p>And then grading -- oh boy!<p>Take this, for example.  Here is the first exercise from my first-year college calculus textbook (Michael Spivak's Calculus).<p><pre><code>  Prove: If ax = a for some number a != 0, then x = 1
</code></pre>
If you see that and think ""That's easy enough to express in a way a computer understands, and there are proof verification systems"" you're missing the point.  No mathematician does his work that way.  It would be like asking someone to learn programming by reading through a book and instead of writing<p><pre><code>  for(i = 0;i < n;i++) {
    printf(""%d\n"", i);
  }
</code></pre>
you force students to write it down by hand in plain English instead of C.  If you're an engineer, think of all the ink spent on whether whiteboard interviews are good or not.  Asking mathematicians to do their work on a computer will get the same kind of response.<p>(Empathy, brother!)<p>The above was just my stream of consciousness, but I've been thinking about this for a bit now.  Love this topic!<p>*: Yes, I've seen his videos.  They're fantastic and do a great job illustrating his educational philosophy.",1328644624

Most MOTO merchant accounts advertise better rates but the effective rate the merchants pay is more than PayPal's 1.9-2.9%. PayPal's rate is flat, but anywhere else it's not. Virtually all credit cards (all rewards/points/cashback cards, all business cards, etc) are downgraded to a higher fee schedule -- plus AVS fees, auth misuse fees, batch settlement fees, statement fees, customer service fees, PCI compliance fees (virtually everyone added at least $100 a year in PCI fees in the past 2 years), chargeback fees, etc. And these are all variable and will generally be raised, one piece at a time, every month you have your account open.<p>I've worked with 3 direct merchant accounts and my effective rate is between 4% and 8% of transaction volume. At PayPal it's less than 4% including the fixed ($0.30) portion of the fee. A company with the expected volume of Etsy can probably negotiate a contract with fixed rates for some number of years, but the other 99% of small businesses accepting credit cards online (card-not-present transactions) are not beating PayPal's rates.",1328643463

Worked my ass off on it for a year and a half.  It failed and went nowhere, as many startups do.<p>But I felt that in many ways, the experience set me free.  I'd kinda coasted through school, college, and my first job half-assing whatever work I felt like, because I figured that at some indefinite point in the future, I'd found a startup and become a millionaire, and so nothing I did really mattered.  Whenever things didn't work out, there was always some reason - ""The material wasn't challenging"" or ""The professor didn't like me"" or ""It's not what I want to do anyway"" or ""We're using the wrong technology stack"" to explain it away.<p>When it was just me & my cofounder though, the material <i>was</i> challenging, it <i>was</i> what I wanted to do, there was nobody else to blame, and if we were using the wrong technology stack, I damn well better change it.<p>So even though it didn't work out, I felt that I gave it my best effort and made a sincere shot at it.  And that set me free to give my best effort on other things, because really, the consequences of it not working out were pretty minor (I got hired by Google).  It wasn't the outcome that mattered, it was the process of figuring out what I was capable of when I really put my mind to it.<p>I'd much rather figure that out at 27, when I'm single, living like a college student, and have my whole career ahead of me, than when I'm 40 with a couple kids, a mortgage, and a string of dead-end jobs behind me.  And I'd much rather figure it out at 40 than when I'm dead.",1328642284

For example, every exam tests if we ""know"" the theorums from the tested sections.  An example of a theorem we were tested on is, ""Each diagonal of a rhombus bisects two angles of a rhombus"". Students can see that that statement is true, but students don't know why (including me).<p>As a result, we don't see any applications of it besides the test, the final, and future math classes.<p>I haven't seen any software that doesn't just make what teachers already do faster. Everything I've seen for math is just incremental -- things like putting a scantron online, or letting me find out what my homework is online. At this point, technology isn't helping me understand math better.",1328641276

If you've developed one of the other apps you can share the same App ID which gives you access to the same storage space so you could create a flag to indicate one of your apps has been installed. Some apps respond to certain protocols so you can ask iOS if a given protocol will be handled and if it returns yes then you know the app is installed. Again because they are sandboxed you really can't do anything harmful and responding to the protocol only allows the other app to receive information, not expose it.<p>Emails: No, the only way you can do anything with email is prompt the user to compose an email.<p>Notes: Same as Mobile Safari.<p>Pics: You can display a popup to the user that asks them to select an image from their camera roll/iPhoto and if they select a photo you then get a reference to an object that represents the photo. You can't just search their camera roll.<p>EDIT: rbritton points out that with the AssetLibrary framework you can actually search through all pics/videos and for some reason it gives a location access prompt when you do. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3563336"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3563336</a><p>Vids: Same as pics.<p>Music List: You can get a list of every song in the users library without asking for permission:<p>Podcast list: Same as music list.<p>iTunes Username: To my knowledge there is no way to access this but I've never been asked to so I really haven't spent time looking.

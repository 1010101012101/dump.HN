Just because it&#x27;s C doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s faster than an implementation in your favourite scripting language.<p>Having said that, compilers do pretty badly on C-to-simd optimisation. The best you get is loop vectorization if it&#x27;s really simple logic. You can usually get some pretty good wins there. The fact you lay out your memory for simd usually is a win all of its own due to cache prefetching even if you don&#x27;t actually use any simd instructions. Compilers need heuristics to manage cache when you know what you&#x27;re trying to do, (eg when should it use non-temporal writes, for example?) Fast C code is written while having a really clear mental model of the underlying architecture and the assembly that the C will produce with -O3 (or whatever flag is relevant to your compiler) and then checked with -S or objdump -D, profiled with callgrind/cachegrind, perf, rdtsc etc...<p>The compiler really can&#x27;t &quot;Do it for you&quot; You /can/ use a compiler as one of your tools when /you/ do it. As Randy Hyde points out you can always beat the compiler because you can use its generated assembly language in every case you can&#x27;t beat, so the absolute worst you get is a tie.<p>So yeah, you can totally smoke clang, Intel, microsoft and gnu C compiler and get paid something for doing it in certain industries too. :-)<p>Mike Acton being aggressively opinionated on the subject, but the lecture is <i>really</i> good (despite/because of) the bits you&#x27;ll disagree with and the manner he&#x27;ll rub you the wrong way.

Also, it&#x27;s necessary to present evidence that our unheard of incarceration rates are what actually casued violent crime to drop to unheard-of lows. Some people have proposed, for example, that the most compelling reason for the drop in violent crime in the US was attributable to lower levels of lead exposure in children of the 70s and 80s, due to the elimination of lead from gasoline and paint.<p>- [edit: I misread what you were saying here, the point about the death penalty is a non-sequitur on my part] Your second point isn&#x27;t one I would disagree with but, but I don&#x27;t think your example is a particularly good one: there is ample evidence indicating that the death penalty does not serve as a particularly strong deterrent. For example, murder rates in the US are actually lower in death penalty states, and have been since the 90s.<p>- &quot;That means changes need to occur with the electorate, not elite legal minds.&quot; The author never asserts the legal profession is the only thing that can reform our broken criminal justice system. However he points out that the legal services we have now are vastly inadequate to the job of protecting the rights of most Americans caught up in the criminal justice system, and that part of the reason so many people are incarcerated is that they recieve little-to-no represenatation. Furthermore: &quot;even apart from the millions of pending criminal cases for which people are not being provided a well-resourced and zealous attorney, every one of the thousands of unlawful stops, searches, home raids, beatings, taserings, shootings, and arrests that take place every day forms the basis for a freestanding constitutional civil rights suit. A quiet tragedy of the legal system is that these rampant daily violations are almost never litigated.&quot;<p>The broader point he is making is that the criminal justice system is only able to grind through tens of thousands of lives each day becuase those involved in it--and that includes lawyers and judges--are commited to keeping that system well-oiled and functioning. &quot;Imagine a world in which lawyers stood ready, en masse, to use their skills and training and intellects to vindicate these constitutional rights every day. Such a social movement of lawyers would dramatically alter the nature of the legal system and our society. The system of modern policing, which depends on callous indifference to vindicating basic rights, would crumble at our simple willingness to hold it to its own formal rules. We can do it, but only through massive collective action to act on our professional and moral values.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States#Violent_and_nonviolent_crime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_Sta...</a>

It is an encoding that makes things <i>less</i> intelligible and the luxury of <i>choosing</i> a less intelligible form is a mark of social status, e.g. a doctor&#x27;s prescription is stereotypically poorly penned but the social status disparity meant nurses, pharmacists and patients just had to deal with it.<p>Programming since the demise of Cobol has had a similar hermeneutic strand. Languages designed for intelligibility by ordinary persons are limited in expressibility and denigrated by the community of programmers, e.g. HTML isn&#x27;t deemed a <i>real</i> programming language and its users aren&#x27;t deemed programmers.<p>Even though HTML is one of the more directly applicable languages to ordinary school day tasks it is eschewed for <i>real</i> languages and the objective becomes making baubles rather than layering in a communication technique on ordinary tasks.

Star Trek: Into Darkness made half a billion, which is still brilliant. But it means that, according to the studio, there’s still $1bn worth of box office that don’t go and see Star Trek. And they want to know why.”<p>> He further explained “People don’t see it being a fun, brightly coloured, Saturday night entertainment like the Avengers,” adding that the solution was to “make a Western or a thriller or a heist movie, then populate that with Star Trek characters so it’s more inclusive to an audience that might be a little bit reticent.”",1432124549

The fact is that price isn&#x27;t always the best proxy for success. More people using it, more companies getting involved etc, can be more important.<p>When we look at price historically we can find strange things like the price being a fraction of a dollar (some 70 cents or so) in April in 2011. Only a few months later, in June 2011, the price was $30. And then it collapsed that very same year and the price dropped to $2, a few times more than it was earlier, but far from the peak.<p>It&#x27;d have been pretty myopic to then conclude that bitcoin was past its peak, even though in the short term it was, having lost more than 90% of its value at peak. It&#x27;d also have been wrong to say it missed its chance at mainstream success.<p>Today the price is an order of magnitude larger, and users, usage and involvement with mainstream (large) companies has grown even more.<p>So again, it&#x27;s quite possible, but I think too soon to tell.<p>As for the lack of interest from the general public... I think bitcoin at its core is a utility, like you could say the internet is. The internet is extremely uninteresting to people, very few get it, nobody is excited about it. But the web is huge, as is emailing and skype and netflix. That&#x27;s completely different from the Internet though, the boring platform/utility/infrastructure that supports it. I can&#x27;t blame someone not being interested in bitcoin. But internet of things having digital wallets and doing payments, contracts, deeds etc on the bitcoin ledger, where all the consumer sees is that it &#x27;just works&#x27;, that&#x27;s interesting. It&#x27;s up to companies then to build ontop of bitcoin, and there is tons of interest from companies, both startups and traditional (tech) companies. Which means it&#x27;s not very surprising to see companies and VCs get excited, but the general public not, in the same way that few got excited about the Internet, but Internet entrepreneurs did, who built companies like Amazon or Skype that people did get excited about. The fact that bitcoin couldn&#x27;t start out like that and had to grow based on a small amount of fanatics looking to avoid the dollar/euro/etc and live on a new currency is probably a great source of distraction from the larger point of bitcoin as a platform, as it reduces bitcoin to being a currency used to shop online and not many feel like doing that, making it look as there is no interest from the general public and nobody will ever use it etc.",1432124435

That works nicely - we have an hour and try to teach some basic point in the first few minutes and then the kids are off. It is a noisy, fun process as they kids help each other and ask us how to do things. My coteacher is a CS professor at a local engineering university.<p>Its a blast. Scratch allows them to make little games and animations. They honestly seem to pick it up themselves.<p>Another resource that I like is NoStarch press which is an imprint (right word?) of O&#x27;Reilly.

The algorithms would be able to detect that enough people want to watch a Kung-Fu thriller set in medieval South India starring Summer Glau to be viable - the point of these things is that &quot;big data&quot; machine learning can process several orders of magnitude more data than a Hollywood-bubble studio executive gut feeling ever could.<p>Formulaic mass-market blockbuster stuff is the product of humans and their gut feelings, and broad averages over the mass market is the highest abstraction they can handle. Algorithms have no such limitations.<p>The truly niche/innovative out-of-left-field stuff exists because it was able to bypass concerns about mass-market viability - if anything, the algorithms will pick up on niche trends much quicker, bringing it to a larger audience.",1432123731

They&#x27;re used more as labels of pride and prejudice, and much of their associated feelings and statements are based on personal beliefs rather than actual human interaction. Consider how many news articles are writing about the habits of Millenials these days with regards to work and life. Most, if not all, of them are written as rants looking to pin the author&#x27;s dislike of modern culture on a younger generation. Even Boomers had their share of unfounded, ranting criticism from their predecessor generations when they were younger, and it&#x27;s fair to assume that in the future we&#x27;ll have articles written by Millennials about how Gen-Z is lazy and ungrateful.

No-one should ever have switched to SQL Server accoring to the logic in the text.

I assume the shooter tried to maintain a consistently steady hand throughout.<p>The motion blur is significant because it speaks to the increased aperture/ decreased exposure time in the 4S, which are both part of the phone wouldn't you agree?

3208759,comment,3208376,3208672,5,0,andrewjshults,,,"I haven't used mailgun's API (yet) but I worked on a fairly involved incoming email system that used sendgrid's parse API and I'm currently deciding between the two for another reply system. Sendgrid's parse API (in it's current state) is pretty basic - they forward anything that match the MX record to your endpoint without any process. Mailgun seems to smooth out a lot of the nasty things. In particular:
1) Signature/Quoted reply removal - this is the part I'm most excited about (and cautious about since I've seen how much of a headache this can be). We wasted countless hours tweaking regexs to handle weird signatures - if they can get to even 90% I'd be happy. 
2) UTF-8 transcoding - Sendgrid tries to parse out which format things are but it's still up to you to get it into UTF-8 (or whatever format you want it in). This wasn't a huge problem, but every now and then gmail would decide to use some really specific character sets that we had trouble converting (this could also be partially a PHP issue) 
3) Routing on their server - this wasn't a big deal for what we were building, but it'd be nice to isolate the routing code from the processing code and have actual rules rather than just a catch all.<p>The other nice thing is that with sendgrid's pricing changes, you can't start to play with the parse API unless you're willing to shell out $80/month. Mailgun lets you use it on the free plan and it's only $20/month for custom domains.",1320710003

Bill's money has to come from somewhere so the ""everything else remained the same"" is just not possible...<p>Unfortunately if people are getting much richer than other people it is necessarily at other people's expense - a reasonable approximation is to think of money like energy, which can never be created or destroyed (its not quite true) - Bill doesn't make his pile of money out of nothing leaving everything unchanged, the money he makes comes from other people's piles of money - these need not be poorer people, in fact I bet most of them are big businesses, but then they don't get their money from nothing either, and their budget decisions on how much to spend on MS software will be balanced alongside salaries etc... at any rate, that money moves around and naively, if you made too much you would quite literally be making everyone else poor. I don't have access to huge amounts of data needed to workout how this scales in reality and if Bill is anywhere near the point where he is almost certainly making everyone poorer, but it is a trivial consequence of the nature of money.<p>This is the nature of capitalism - if every one does what is in their best interest, some talented/lucky/greedy people will end up much better off with zero incentive to improve the situation for anyone else. Thankfully capitalism is merely an ideal and nobody follows it that blindly - Bill at least tries to give some of his money away to good causes lately...",1320709701

If you do not control even one node that a person is connected to, there is always the possibility that the request came from this other node, not the real node. This is because the difference between making a request for something on your behalf and making the request on someone else's behalf looks exactly the same as far as another node is concerned.<p>This is how freenet works. Of course, in freenet there is a time to live associated with each request so it will die eventually if, for example, the searched for item is not present on the network at that time. You could figure out that it's from a particular node by seeing what the time to live is from that node, but small amounts of random variance in time to live values can effectively ensure that both requests don't live forever and that it is suitably difficult to determine the origin of the requesting node.<p>Now, it is certainly possible with enough concerted effort to find out what a user is doing with some statistical probability that a user is looking at something, but you can rarely be absolutely sure.",1320708829

You can also see the role of one more -- intuition, especially its best form, geometric intuition.  Right:  Intuition doesn't prove anything, but it can be one of the best ways to guess what is true and how to prove it.  For more, eventually you can get a useful intuitive feeling for a topic.<p>There's<p><a href=""http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-contents/why-can2019t-a-woman-be-more-like-a-man/?searchterm=Sommers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-co...</a><p>which at face value is supposed to be about women in math but describes Harvard's Math 55.  At least at one time for that course the three main texts were:<p>Paul R. Halmos, 'Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces, Second Edition', D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey.<p>Walter Rudin, 'Principles of Mathematical Analysis, Third Edition', McGraw-Hill.<p>Michael Spivak, 'Calculus on Manifolds:  A Modern Approach to Classical Theorems of Advanced Calculus', W. A. Benjamin, New York.<p>Working successfully through those three is quite sufficient to understand proof-based college math!<p>Those three are all old; in particular Halmos wrote the first edition of his book in 1942 when he was an assistant to von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study.<p>I had Rudin's book in college but later rushed to work carefully through both Halmos and Spivak ASAP after college.<p>Instead of Spivak, I preferred:<p>Wendell H. Fleming, 'Functions of Several Variables', Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts.<p>Might also consider:<p>Lynn H. Loomis and Shlomo Sternberg, 'Advanced Calculus', ISBN 0-201-04305-X, Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts.<p>For exterior algebra, now can get in English:<p>Henri Cartan, 'Differential Forms', ISBN 0-486-45010-4, Dover, Mineola, NY.<p>Since mentioned Halmos and since this thread is about probability and statistics, should mention that Halmos was one of the best in those topics in the US in the 20th century.<p>Halmos was a student of J. Doob at University of Illinois as in:<p>J. L. Doob, 'Stochastic Processes', John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1953.<p>and has a very nice start on probability in:<p>Paul R. Halmos, 'Measure Theory', D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., Princeton, NJ, 1950.<p>Halmos also wrote:<p>Paul R. Halmos, ""The Theory of Unbiased Estimation"", 'Annals of Mathematical Statistics', Volume 17, Number 1, pages 34-43, 1946.<p>and also the crucial:<p>Paul R. Halmos and L. J. Savage, ""Application of the Radon-Nikodym Theorem to the Theory of Sufficient Statistics"", Annals of Mathematical Statistics, Volume 20, Number 2, 225-241, 1949.<p>Yes 'Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces' is really a finite dimensional introduction to Hilbert space which mostly have to attribute to von Neumann (who once reminded Hilbert what it was).<p>The set of all real valued random variables X such that E[X^2] is finite forms a Hilbert space.  The amazing part is completeness, and there is a proof in:<p>Walter Rudin, 'Real and Complex Analysis', ISBN 07-054232-5, McGraw-Hill, New York.<p>which also has a nice chapter on Hilbert space.<p>Yes, having professors write their own books is now more common and can make a course more efficient for the students.  It was long the case that a student had to copy the 'text' off the board or just take notes and turn them into a text.  Now with TeX and LaTeX, PDF, and the Internet, finally the word whacking for the math can often be less work than the math!<p>Still, it will be difficult to improve on some of the best texts, e.g., Halmos.  Rudin went through at least three editions of his 'Principles', and the level of polish started high and increased.  A good book is actually NOT easy to write.",1320707991

First you have to understand not all designers are created equal. You tend to have ""Rock Stars"" (or in the agency speak a Creative Director) and a spectrum down to ""production"" designers.   ""Creative Directors"" tend to be good at a lot of the different design disciplines, they understand business objectives, they can help with product and feature vision, they understand usability and they can make things pretty.  Its the entire package.<p>If they go to work for a brand new startup they start with a blank slate, all the needs and challenges are large and the designer is fully engaged because they have to draw on all their different skill sets to solve problems.<p>But as time progresses the needs of a startup tends to shift from where there is less need to do full UX the product is now defined and its about making small incremental changes. This is where they go from being a ""Creative Director"" to a production designer. As a CD they get to design the web site with a brand new look and feel, as a production designer they're doing a new module on the home page which matches the existing design standards.<p>Basically the challenges keep getting smaller, and the designer is less engaged.   There's a similar arc in development, however while at first you need to do ""Big Things"" (get the site up) and some of the changes become smaller, at least those small things can be as challenging (or more so) then the ""Big Things"" (optimize the load time).<p>Finally as a designer you live and die by your portfolio, and having a one site portfolio gets you nowhere.

One requires time and persistence, the other requires knowledge, planning and problem solving.",1320706956

Jobs gets his girlfriend pregnant, and then denies that the child is his. He parks in handicapped spaces. He screams at subordinates. <i>He cries like a small child when he does not get his way.</i> He sits in a restaurant and sends his food back three times. He arrives at his hotel suite in New York for press interviews and decides, at 10 pm ...  the flowers are all wrong: he wanted calla lilies. <i>When his public-relations assistant returns, at midnight, with the right flowers, he tells her that her suit is ""disgusting"".</i> Machines and robots were painted and repainted as he compulsively revised his color scheme, Isaacson writes, of the factory Jobs built, after founding NeXT, in the late nineteen-eighties.  He insisted that the machinery on the 165-foot assembly line be configured to move the circuit boards from right to left as they got built, so that the process would look better to visitors who watched from the viewing gallery. ...<i>when Jobs returns, in the late nineteen-nineties, and our natural expectation is that Jobs will emerge wiser and gentler from his tumultuous journey. He never does.</i> In the hospital at the end of his life, he runs through sixty-seven nurses before he finds three he likes...<p>...Even within Apple, Jobs was known for taking credit for other's ideas. Jonathan Ive, the designer behind the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone, tells Isaacson, <i>""He will go through a process of looking at my ideas and say, 'That's no good. That's not very good. I like that one.' And later I will be sitting in the audience and he will be talking about it as if it was his idea.""</i><p>----------------------------------------<p>Was Jobs really such an <i>asshole</i>? If so, I think he was really lucky to have Steve Woz as his co-founder. I know a lot about Woz and hardly anything about Jobs, and I do know that Woz in addition to being a first rate engineer is also a very good guy. Maybe if Woz was even half the asshole that Jobs seems to be, he might have kicked him out before Apple went public and Jobs would have been just another tantrum throwing hippie hanging around some starbucks in Berkeley or wherever angry hippies like to hang around.",1320706938

So, you usually have a VERY stripped down interface of setup/update/render functions that allow you to do an interactive task quickly.<p>If that seems limiting, that's because it is. The thing to realize is that you're /supposed/ to be limited in the outcome of your program. Usually in creative coding frameworks, you're just trying to make a program that does a single thing, but needs graphics/sound/interactivity. Limiting the interface down to what you need means you can program with the end interactive situation in mind.<p>This tends to mean creative frameworks eschew quite a bit of software engineering practices in deference to ease/speed, which can cause software developers coming into these frameworks to think they're, well, crap. But, the single use practicality does make it nice versus trying to implement this stuff in something like a full on game engine.",1320706895

211987,comment,211782,211898,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The whole references thing is the biggest pain in the ass in Perl syntax.  List flattening, and the fact that arrays and hashes can only store scalars (or a reference to something else), etc. just expands into every nook and cranny of the language.<p>I still have a hard time with this aspect of the language after 10 years of Perl coding (with a three year break where I mostly worked with Python).  And given how strong the tools in Perl are for working with hashes and arrays (grep, map, join, splice/unsplice, shift/unshift, sort, etc.) it really is a pain point.  Perl 6 fixes many of the painful bits but not all.<p>But, nonetheless, I'm more productive in Perl than any other language.  Partly because of the massive library of excellent pre-existing code, and partly because my problem domain almost always involves text parsing/processing and dealing with system-level data which are things for which Perl was designed.",1212908235

It's a few years into the project, but the specification may still change. So it's more interesting toy than production-ready right now.<p>-It compiles to C code and can directly inline C statements with a simple backquote syntax so it has good compatibility with existing systems, even though it's meant for a research OS.",1212907467
211983,comment,211782,211898,0,0,systems,,,"while completely ignoring the right hand side, i can tell they are all scalars.<p>Looking at the right hand side, I can tell the type of the value in that scalar type! ... the value type is a different thing than the variable type<p>We can really debate and argue about the value of typeful variables ... the value seem to be that it allow a combination of syntactic sugar and availability of the reference type!<p>So basically, if you want a reference type, you need syntax to dereference the reference.<p>And if you have that, you will eventually need syntax sugar for when you dont want to use the dereferencing syntax.<p>This is probably why in Perl things are the way they are!<p>I am not sure thought if the reference type is at all needed, it some occasions I see it clarify cases when values are passed by reference vs passed by value, because a reference in Perl is a real value, not something that is implied! ... but this i would say is largly subjective",1212907280

Talk to a lawyer, even at a university or public-service law clinic, if you need the real info for your jurisdiction(s). So take anything here, including the below, with a grain of salt.<p>(2) Here in California, I have been given the impression California law prevents most non-compete clauses from being enforceable, on the theory everyone has a right to earn a living using their acquired (and often market-specific) skills. I have heard NY law is similar.",1212904977

She wants credit for being very up-to-date and politically correct - but she didn't have the guts to put that supposed ""fact"" into the actual novels, knowing that it might hurt sales.  What a pretentious, puffed-up coward. When I have a gay character in my fiction, I say so right in the book. I don't wait until after it has had all its initial sales to mention it.""<p>-- Orson Scott Card, <<a href=""http://www.linearpublishing.com/RhinoStory.html&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linearpublishing.com/RhinoStory.html&#62</a>;",1212904938

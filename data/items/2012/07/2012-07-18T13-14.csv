Looking at the screen is the obvious choice, but for typing practice you might actually want to look at your keyboard.<p>I learned more ergonomic touch typing using two tricks. The first one was to train using the Dvorak keyboard layout, although I don't use it normally. It just made me hold my hands in the right place on the keyboard.

4260642,comment,4256265,4256265,1,0,masto,,,"My tip for using Jenkins (or CI in general): have your build script produce a single-file artifact.  You don't have a .war file, but what you can do is simply tar or zip your project.  I recommend having a source directory and a build directory, and writing your build script such that the source directory is untouched and the output files are placed in the build directory.  At the end, zip up that build directory and call it your artifact.  You don't HAVE to do this but that's my piece of advice.. it will make your life easier.<p>Once you've got a stable artifact-builder, you can write a nice script that takes that file and deploys it to the location of your choice.<p>As you point out, some work needs to be done to determine which files are copied in the build process.  I'm not familiar with PHP, but I am involved in an HTML application that has a similar need.

But if you're going to throw out this evidence you're going to have to throw out the rest of modern medicine too.</i><p>No, what needs to be thrown out is armchair scientists who don't properly understand the scientific method. Just because you've shown a statistically-significant correlation between two phenomenon, there really is very little reason to expect that shoring up one of those phenomenon will actually have an effect on the other.<p>Let's look at the question at hand, the correlation between (low) IQ and childhood poverty. Observing that the poor are more likely to be undernourished and at the same time, children in poverty show fewer signs of inherited high intelligence, there is very little (one might even say zero) reason to believe that giving poor kids food will improve their intelligence.<p>People seem to nod their heads and say ""yeah, whatever"" when challenged on the difference between <i>causation</i> and <i>correlation</i>, but in fact there's a world of difference.<p>Here's an alternative speculation about the real causation of the observation. Being a single-parent household causes poverty because a smaller income must be spread across the same fixed expenses (rent, etc.) and nearly the same variable expenses (say, 3/4 the food, medical care, etc.), and thus the money ""runs out"" sooner. Being a single-parent household also causes lower IQ, because there is less parental involvement available to the child (helping with homework and the like), because a single parent must be consuming at least as much time working, more (per family member) doing necessary household chores, and thus less remains for the kid.<p>Through this chain of causation, throwing food at the problem may fix the malnutrition, but that's not the identified <i>cause</i> of the lower IQ, so if our goal is to improve IQs, then the investment was entirely wasted. We've still got as many single-parent households who can't invest as much time interacting with the child, and since the actual cause is still out there, there will be just as many lower-IQ kids. Your un-scientific jump to conclusions about the causation has wasted what you've invested to fix it, and worse, because you believed you were fixing it, you've actually blocked more legitimate efforts to fix the real cause.<p>Really: seeing a correlation is no reason to believe that there's causation in effect.

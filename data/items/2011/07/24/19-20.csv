And to be fair to Google what makes Facebook good to a degree is that people are anchored to a real identity  this prevents flame wars and all sorts of other noise. Honestly part of the spam problem on Twitter is the ability to setup a fake profile via robot and start spamming everyone within seconds -- fake IDs also are part of what made MySpace feel like a collection of misfits (not that that in itself is a bad thing, but it doesn't lend itself to marketing to a broader audience).<p>So yes I'd expect Google to want you to be real -- on the other hand that may give room for Twitter or someone new to do something more interesting.

2800182,comment,2798952,2799574,1,0,sigil,,,"> For one, the path argument comes before any options or flags.<p>Actually, it does conform to unix conventions:<p><pre><code>   find [OPTIONS] [PATHS] [EXPRESSION]\n</code></pre>\nWhere options are ""-PLHDO"" in the GNU version. The elements of EXPRESSION may be introduced by a dash, but they're not really options. Together, they specify a little program to evaluate on every path. The program could have easily taken the form 'type f a name foo' instead of '-type f -a -name foo'. The only issue would be recognizing the end of PATHS arguments and the beginning of EXPRESSION arguments...perhaps that's why the dash is used? It does seem like OPTIONS EXPRESSION [--] PATHS would be easier and less ambiguous to parse.<p>> Also, what is the point of the '-print' option? Pretty much every other utility prints results to stdout by default.<p>find does print to stdout by default. Perhaps -print was added later to distinguish the default mode from -print0, which is common when pairing with xargs.<p>> I welcome any historical context or clarification if my expectations are in fact flawed.<p>I was kind of hoping the recently rehabilitated UNIX 1972 sources would shed some light on your questions.

Articles accepted by journals of high reputation get a high reputation, and the journals select high-reputation individuals to do reviews. A good distributed reputation algorithm could perform essentially the same function.

Firstly, you are right to make the distinction between anonymous and pseudonymous, they're two different things and you can build a reputation system and healthy community on a pseudonymous system (see HN). However, I think they both exhibit the same underlying problem that comes with lack of accountability. HN has been lucky, because it's for the most part an elite community full of smart people. Digg or reddit have not been so lucky, and the quality of comments there is quite low. HN is the exception, not the rule.<p>Secondly, I also agree that there's definitely some edge cases where it make sense for people to be anonymous, or pseudonymous.

Like what some say about operator overloading, but even worse.<p>3) what syntax do you write your own code in, if it's closely involved with two different libraries that use different syntaxes?<p>4) what if two different libraries use the same syntax to do different things?<p>Does anyone know what the philosophy on these points is for meta-languages?",1311534164

But for it to actually be a useful tool, I think the ability to schedule is important.",1311534156

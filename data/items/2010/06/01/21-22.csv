You buy a couple more and place them in surrounding streets. Now you're making even more money. You buy two more stalls, and then the local council steps up and says ""you can't operate anymore stalls. The three you have are fine and you can continue to operate them and make money, but you can't expand any further."" Now you feel like shit because you've bought two stalls that are useless, but at least you're still making money on the first three.",1275429505
1396284,comment,1395818,1396174,0,0,seldo,,,"Really, this is just ""NoSQL for the web"". And I have the same problem with it that I have with all NoSQL APIs, which is that it's not noticeably simpler or more performant, it just looks a bit more ""object-y"". As you note, it doesn't even have a way of doing joins. (There's no reason you couldn't support SQL in the browser that allowed you to create tables with indexes)<p>The reason the SQL standard exists is not because it's the absolute best way of accessing structured data, but because a <i>standard</i> way of accessing structured data is useful in and of itself. It has economies of training and learning and allows for some limited amount of portability between DB engines.<p>In 5 years, somebody is going to invent some kind of meta-API that allows you to use a single common API to access all of cassandra, couchdb, mongodb, and the rest, and I'm just going to laugh and laugh.",1275429477

1396231,comment,1395479,1396171,0,0,MichaelSalib,,,"<i>Leaving immediately would encourage the bank to sell the house as quickly as possible to a new owner.</i><p>In many parts of their country, there is a large excess of supply, so it is unlikely that a quick sale is possible. Which means that the house will likely sit on the market for 6-12 months.<p>In some areas, banks are walking away from properties they foreclosed upon, legally abandoning them. The responsibility for maintaining or demolishing the property then reverts back to the original mortgage holder, who often gets no notice and believed that they had nothing to do with the property since it was foreclosed. Under such circumstances, I think it can make sense for people to refuse to move out: if the house will continue to be an open ended obligation for you, you might as well at least get a place to live out of it. See this article for more information: <a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/news/index.ssf/2009/07/bank_walkaways_from_foreclosed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleveland.com/news/index.ssf/2009/07/bank_walkawa...</a><p><i>why fix the roof of a house you are going to be kicked out of</i><p>Two reasons. (1) Because you don't like rain water poring over your head while sleeping in bed. No one wants to live in a house where rain water is poring on them. No one wants to live in a house where mold and mildew have taken root from pooling water. And no one wants to share a house with raccoons. (2) Homeowners often develop irrational attachments to the home that they ""own""; that is why many people buy homes when doing so makes no economic sense. These irrational attachments may incentivize people to maintain homes when rational calculation suggests they should not. Remember, being a ""good"" homeowner is a key concept of many people's self-image. Doing things like fixing leaks and tending the yard may continue to matter to them even after they've decided that they're not paying another cent.<p><i>Further, leaving immediately would force the bank to mark their assets to market, thereby making it more difficult for them to fool regulators and the public about the state of their balance sheet.</i><p>I don't believe this claim is true. Can you cite anything justifying it? In many areas, foreclosure takes a long time because servicers and courts are overwhelmed with volume; this state of affairs benefits banks who can postpone marking their assets properly.<p><i>I don't consider lowering prices to be a problem.</i><p>Sorry; I misread your comment. Given how little evidence we have that this phenomena affects a significant number of people, I don't find claims that this will materially change market prices to be credible.",1275428425

If the workload is not taxing for you, instead of finding things to fill your spare time, just do the things you have to do as ""inefficiently"" as possible. One of the barriers to trying new things is the drop in efficiency (like switching to a new editor, as per the suggestion before). If you can take the productivity hit, this can be a great opportunity. Frustrated by a lack of feature in the editor? Rather than work around it, fix it and submit a patch. Keep using KDE (or whatever) but switch your locale to French. If you don't already and you are allowed to do so, switch your version control to git - that should mess with your mind for a good while :-)<p>Basically if you genuinely can't leave, just try and make it interesting for yourself and make a habit of stepping  outside your comfort zone - otherwise your brain will rot.<p>The other issue is your actual project.

In certain cases where a display's resolution isn't a whole number multiple of the base resolution, you can get away with slightly shrinking or extending the viewable area. But 480x320 to 800x480 is a particularly inconvenient shift, as assets cannot be scaled up without incurring a large loss in viewable area, and they cannot be kept the same without requiring a large increase in viewable area.<p><i>Incidentally, this is what iPhone developers will have to start doing this summer. The new iPhone's screen is 2x the resolution. Assuming Apple wants to keep the iPhone forward-compatible and run OS3-based apps, that means image resources will be upscaled by the phone and look fuzzy, or developers will have to update their apps with higher-res assets.</i><p>Not true at all. It would only look fuzzy if the screen <i>size</i> were significantly larger. But in fact the screen size is roughly the same, only with a much higher PPI. Because the new resolution is a whole number multiple of the old, <i>all apps</i> can be trivially scaled with 2X nearest-neighbor scaling and look exactly the same as they would on a 480x320 screen.<p><i>As for framerates, you'll never get away from dealing with different hardware, no matter if you do Android, Web, Desktop or iPhone development.

In my experience, it hasn't been that slow for the majority of apps I want to use. But that's sort of irrelevant. As far as a developer is concerned, they only need to own two devices (three after the new iPhone is released) to capture the significant variations in hardware: a first-gen or 3G iPhone, and a 3GS. (Alternatively, and more cheaply, a first-gen and third-gen iPod touch, if you have no need for camera, GPS, etc.)<p>And it's true that you can never get away from dealing with different hardware, but the whole point is <i>how much</i> different hardware you have to deal with.

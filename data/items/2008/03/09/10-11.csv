132437,comment,132256,132256,0,0,kryptos,,,"I finished my UG last year from India, but participated in several OPC's( Online prog contests) winning a few. I also represented my Univ in IBM-ICPC(Inter collegiate prog contest).. all of these were wonderful experiences.Trying out such problems really helps ... and increases your understanding of algorithm complexity and related literature... Google Summer of code during the last year of Univ was also fun.. albeit a different kind of experience...nonetheless taught me a lot. Both me,and my teammate during these code contests who was also a high performer in TC and currently work at different startups. I genuinely believe these experiences definitely made us better hackers.",1205057313

I've set up opera to have many of the same bindings, but navigation in particular just doesn't work as well. Partly that's because there's no grid, but I think it's also just not as well designed.<p>I also like how elinks knows what the 'page down' function means. It either scrolls a page down (if I'm not at/below the bottom) or it doesn't (if I am). All other browsers in my experience think the bottom of the page is more important than my knowing where to start reading from.<p>A plus for opera is that I've actually worked out how to script it.",1205056948

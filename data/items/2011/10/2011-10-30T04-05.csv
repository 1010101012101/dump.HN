But for someone like a factory worker or call center rep, the computers might as well control them, because the humans in charge will gladly manage based on automatically-measured performance numbers without knowing or caring about what's actually happening.<p>The computers can track, measure and grade everything they do.  For example, when I go to Target, I can't help but notice that their checkout screens have a pass/fail system grading whether the checker has processed the person quickly enough.  In other places, computers may even make decisions on who to fire based on the rules fed to it.  For example, the computer's report might say that employee #12345 has high average call lengths.  They don't care if it's because that phone rep was unusually helpful.  The computers enable them to enforce their policies to the letter.  Even if the rules present no win situations at times, they'll just fire the guy for breaking the rules and hire someone new.<p>So like I said, the computers are never going to control us.  We'd hack the damn things if necessary to do things right.  But for the people at the bottom of the food chain, a computer might already be their boss.",1319950655

Both cost time, but they are not the same. Waiting can be avoided (nonblocking), working cannot.<p>Iterating over an array in most languages probably takes .000001 seconds. Reading from a bad connection could take 30+ seconds, or whatever your servers timeout is.<p>Since the 30 seconds is spent _waiting_, it can be avoided within a single thread of execution. On the other hand, if you are spending 30 seconds _working_ to compute prime numbers, this cannot be avoided in a single thread of execution.<p>Blocking vs nonblocking refers to dealing with waits. Does each IO operation do the waiting, or does each IO operation return immediately and we pool waits into a single poll() (etc.) call?<p>Parallelization refers to dealing with work. In the rare instance one needs to generate huge fibonacci sequences, one can do so in a seperate fork\process\thread\cpu core\machine, and report results back to the event loop via pipe\socket\shared memory. [1] Multiplexing waits in a single thread makes sense, multiplexing work in a single thread such as array iteration does not: on the contrary it sounds like a good way to increase the overhead of iteration and generate more work rather than reduce it.<p>It's confusing because some tools such as threads can be used to address both the problem of parallel work and the problem of parallel waits.<p>[1] edit: quick example in lua:<p><pre><code>    -- In fork, write to the blocking end of a pipe
    local r = formfork(function(w)
        local work = fibonacci(10^10)
        w:write(work)

All these talks about Javascript finally catching up in speed to native, and now a slightly non-trivial algorithm and Javascript falls flat in its face. I got similar result to pygorex in my run, and the Javascript implementation is indeed 60X slower than native.<p>Now compare that to HashSum, a a Silverlight-based implementation of the SHA-1 (I verified that it generates the same result), I clocked it and it is 20X faster than the Javascript implementation, and ~3X slower than native. Try it at <a href=""http://www.hashsum.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hashsum.com</a> (I wrote it; Silverlight required; sorry about the ad/layout, it was an ""exercise"" a while back).<p>So HTML5/Javascript is the future, and the future does not include Flash/Silverlight. Perhaps. But this experiment shows that Javascript is clearly way too slow compared to native or plugin. You could argue that the plugin-based scenario is going out of favor. Politics, competition, distribution, etc, are all valid reasons. But ""Javascript is now just as fast"" isn't one, because it is not. Those who are gung-ho about how fast Javascript is needs to write their own SHA-1 implementation that <i>beats</i> <a href=""http://www.hashsum.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hashsum.com</a> ... or at least not be blown away by it.",1319949834

Consider a kid with, say, $500 from babysitting or lawn-mowing. This could buy the kid, say, a really nice bicycle (+ helmet, lock, rack, basket, chain lubricant, etc. Assume they're old enough that they won't outgrow it for a while.) Alternatively, the kid could wait a year and expect to have an extra $20 (given the 4% annualized inflation-adjusted return on the market - what, you're investing, right? not gambling? then you get 4%. :P)<p>Which would you choose: about $20, or a year with a bicycle?

One thing node.js is good at is realtime apps and socket.io and the evented model make these easier.<p>However, as a server developer guy too, I must point out that if scalability ( or premature optimization ) is dear to you, I would look further than cluster to run multiple node processes. A good solution I found for a few projects is to use Redis pub sub to encapsulate socket.io messages to connected clients to make it easy, non-blocking and performant to scale to multiple nodes. For a project where I have some potential CPU bound code, I further split these operations in another process (let's say a game state machine with calculations) with which I exchange pub sub messages. In such realtime apps, the worst that can happen is that some process intensive functions may take a bit more time to dispatch information to the clients but the core communications node processes won't be blocked and will be screaming fast and horizontally scalable.<p>I've found that Redis pub sub is awesome for simple and fast interprocess communications.",1319949288

Only every once in a while something new comes around like iPhone, or Google search or Windows operating system etc etc. And the likeliness of you working on them are as close to negligible. Otherwise what ever you will ever work on, where ever you will ever work at, and its success will often have to often abide by the laws of supply and demand in the market. And the money and long term success flows in the direction where the supply-demand flow is.<p>When you are talking of big IT bellwethers, they are in a business of supplying services at affordable costs. Aren't you seeing the massive potential in this business? today maintenance and services massively outweighs product development and this is time tested truth. Because once you develop something you have to maintain it all the time. Also this is the only business, where you can retain your technical hands on and still climb the corporate management ladder. Combining both parts of the world. This will give you an edge, to add value in both areas. Also these companies, offer massive infrastructure, training and experimenting grounds which a start up in India can never possibly offer. You also get access to great books, and huge network of good people. If you are lucky you get opportunities to travel around the world, doing business,learning and enjoying various cultures around the world. Also their pay is difficult to match.<p>The start up scenario in India is really messed up badly. After so many years we get to see only one flipkart and Infibeam. And from what I have been hearing its no honey and milk there. Its your usual 'safest way to production' route that they take. They are generally Java heavy shops. I wonder if all this trouble is worth. If all you want to work is on Java.<p>After few years if you see you peer in a big IT bellwether(who is/was as good as you) being more successful in terms money and life style. Don't be surprised, he is in a place where there is steady supply of money and opportunities.<p>Its like you will be average among the best. And he will best among the average.<p>Another thing that I have noticed is start up's in India and especially founders are extremely stingy. They tend to see developers as tissues(use and throw entities). And chances of large number of people making into start up's are also lesser. And there aren't too many good start ups.<p>Also these Indian IT companies did a major job of propelling India to global IT forefront. If they were to go away, we will loose massive amounts of employment opportunities, exposure and more importantly confidence to open start ups in the future. Remember they were themselves start up's some time back.",1319948162

3173611,comment,3171777,3172244,1,0,nu23,,,"About the example of grass that you talk about, I think that amounts to a criticism not of empiricism but direct hypothesis checking. We have built up a model of human body and grass which tells us that it would be harmful. Now this background model has been subject to empirical checks at lots of times and has evolved in presence of new empirical discoveries. (Though of course, the model has not been derived axiomatically from empirical data).<p>Almost nothing in science is justified by direct checks. Think of any clinical trial or say, the LHC experiments. There are so many implicitly assumed background theories about how the instruments respond to their stimuli. Some of these instruments are based on principles which were discovered only in this century. So scientists from previous times wouldn't accept the way the results are derived unless they are shown the results derived from previous experiments justifying the way the instruments work. For example, the atomic hypothesis was controversial till 1900 or so. How would one even interpret LHC electron beams if one one doesn't believe in the atomic hypothesis? A useful analogy here, is minesweeper - a new opened square, whose information, via a very long chain can tell us if there is a mine on a far away square.",1319947846

I use ubuntu on the desktop because it just works.  If I want to tinker with Linux, I can do it on a server and get paid for it.  With older versions of ubuntu? heck, getting drivers is usually easier than with windows.  Most things? plug and go, no  downloading a driver from a third party website or anything.  You plug it in and it just works.   (Some things require more work.  Those things get taken back to Fry's.  Again, desktops are low-value.  I'm not going to spend too much time messing with them.)<p>The problem is that unity is, well, it's garbage.  If I wanted a mac, I'd buy a mac.

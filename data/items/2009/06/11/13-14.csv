That's where ""What's a class?"" and ""How do you do a join in SQL?"" come from, and if the candidate can't easily answer, their resume is bloated, game over.  Google it is a bad answer.<p>Also realize that even though you consider something to be trivia, your interviewer doesn't or the question wouldn't be asked.  Saying, ""I'd just google it"" is dismissive, and people don't like being dismissed.<p>What you can do is invoke Google techniques as part of a larger problem.  Like, ""I forget the order of arguments to this function, but that's on Google, can you tell me if I got it right?""  When the point of the question isn't the trivia, but the approach.",1244727729

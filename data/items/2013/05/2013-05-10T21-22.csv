For those to whom it's <i>actually</i> not familiar, here's some insight into how poor people spend money on gas:<p>Poor people share rides a lot.  They borrow small amounts of money from each other a lot.  They take turns paying for things depending on who has money at that time.  They mix bartering with payment.  They do all of these methods simultaneously.  e.g. ""I'll give you half of that six-pack and a ride on Tuesday and Thursday if you pay for the gas to get us to work today.""<p>It's much easier to arrange these payments around small amounts than to ask for $80 to fill up a truck's gas tank.  Furthermore, having a full gas tank is a disadvantage because 1. you are no longer liquid and 2. you are no longer able to extract payment from others for rides.<p>BTW, I find this article and the one it references to show little or no concern for the actual people involved.  The real reason for this articles is obvious: They're pushing for access to that juicy consumer spending data and using ""helping the poor"" as a thinly-veiled excuse.<p>They have the chain of causality reversed.  It's not poor people's habits screwing up the economy with credit card companies creating the possibility for recovery.  It's increased prices^Wusury by credit card companies grinding the economy down, draining peoples' wallets prematurely.<p>Why do CEOs of credit card companies continue to demand continued income?  Just because they can?  With 1 in 7 people on food stamps, must they keep pushing?  Can't they just declare victory and play golf the rest of their life?  Why push harder and harder to squeeze more and more out of the middle and lower classes?",1368223140

</code></pre>
You're not alone in this, but as you go on in advanced math you find more and more that multiplication is not really repeated addition, it just happens to coincide with repeated addition when that makes sense. The problem/opportunity is that multiplication still makes sense when repeated addition doesn't.<p>It might be easier to think of this with regard powers.  People teach that A^5 is just AxAxAxAxA.  You then deduce that A^a x A^b = A^(a+b). From that you start to assign meanings to things like A^0.  And A^(-1).  But what does it mean to multiply together -1 copies of a number?  That doesn't make sense!<p>And what about A^{\pi} ?  How can you have a transcendental number of things multiplied together?  It doesn't make sense!<p>As you get deeper into math you need different definitions of powers, and of multiplication, and you find they they coincide with repeated multiplication and repeated addition, they may have originated with those ideas, but that's not really the best way to think about them, and it's not, in some sense, what they ""are"".<p>A poor analogy might be this.  To an outsider, Smalltalk and Haskell will kind of look the same.  They're programming languages, they do the same things.  But they are really very different animals.  So multiplication is really a very different animal from repeated addition.",1368222697

There are unions that emulate sub-typing and unions that have a manually implemented tag system. Basically, C programmers have to work around the language's deficiencies manually and hope to avoid errors--nothing surprising, I suppose.<p>More importantly, tagged unions simply make more sense. They are the mathematical dual of structs, which means that having both exposes a natural symmetry in language design. And, just like in physics, symmetry almost always means you're on the right track!<p>And, of course, once you have tagged unions and structs, you've added algebraic data types to your language.

Consequently, your destroying some BTC enriches everyone else holding BTC to almost exactly the same degree that it impoverishes you.<p>I anticipate objections to the above on the grounds that ""deflationary currencies are bad"".  The most chartitable interpretation of, ""deflationary currencies are bad,"" is ""the downward stickiness of the price of labor"": during a recession, unemployment tends to go up in part because most employees are irrationally averse to taking a pay cut when times get rough, and enlightened monetary policy can sometimes negate or ameliorate that particular irrational reaction by employees by inflating the currency, which has the effect of fooling the employees into thinking that their ""real"" compensation has not decreased.

To ""cure"" this, one idea would be to create an anti-social network - somewhere where you present the worst possible image of yourself, a place to relieve yourself of the burdens you'd never pollute your positive image / good vibe feed presented on your Facebook stream.  As well as giving people a place to open up to that side of themselves you'd see your friends being honest about their downsides so wouldn't have such a high bar to compete with, helping you to feel more human.

Then, look at two options:<p><pre><code>   Option #1: Hashed, no Salt
   Option #2: Hashed + Salt.
</code></pre>
In Scenario #1 - your password is secure in Option #1, because your password does not appear in a rainbow table.<p>In Scenario #2 - the vast majority (60%+) of those weak passwords can be brute forced with sophisticated dictionary attacks in a couple days even with a hash+salt - no need to use rainbow tables.<p>Ironically, Salt's offer no security for you (you don't need them), or the vast majority of people (whose password will be broken, even if they are salted+hashed).  Salts+Hash were relevant from 1990-2010, prior to high speed GPUs and ASICs overtaking Rainbow Tables.   People learned lessons then, that are no longer relevant.<p>Now, where Salts ARE important, is with a multi-iteration key-derivative function like bcrypt or scrypt.  There, a salt (which is part of the bcrypt and scrypt algorithm) actually does offer (a lot) of security to the n00bs.  Without salts scrypt/bcrypt would once again tip the balance back in favor of Rainbow Tables.

There was also an obvious existential threat that Russia felt from the US nuclear power displayed at Hiroshima/Nagasaki.  Both the US and Russia invested a great deal in means for responding to these threats.  While Russia edged out the US in a handful of things early on, by the 1969 Moon landing (if not sooner) it was clear the US had the lead in rocketry  as well as nuclear weapons.

   Instructors in a Mathematical Experience course must be
   prepared to respond to questions from students concerning
   the fundamental nature of the whole mathematical
   enterprise. Stimulated by their reading of the text,
   students will ask about the underlying logical and
   philosophical issues, the role of mathematical methods
   and their origins, the substance stance of contemporary
   mathematical advances, the meaning of rigor and proof in
   mathematics, the role of computational mathematics, and
   issues of teaching and learning. How real is the conflict
   between pure mathematics, as represented by G. H.
   Hardys statements, and applied mathematics? they may
   ask. Are there other kinds of mathematics, neither pure
   nor applied? This edition of the book provides a source
   of problems, collateral readings, references, essay and
   project assignments, and discussion guides for the
   course.""

   ""The authors state, Most writers on the subject seem to
    agree that the typical working mathematician is a Platonist
    on weekdays and a formalist on Sundays. The substance 
    of the mathematics appears to change with experience and
    depends on the person recounting the story. But it has an 
    objective reality that is independent of the person. Alas, 
    when precision is required, it is common to retreat to the
    formalist position that mathematics is only a created 
    structure of axioms, definitions, and their consequences.""

5688682,comment,5688222,5688222,6,0,spankalee,,,"I know the prevailing attitude here is anti-DRM at all costs, but I think this argument hits some incredibly good points. Basically there are only a few options for delivering available to companies like Netflix:<p><pre><code>  1. Write native apps
  2. Use HTML with a plug-in
  3. Integrate DRM into HTML
  4. Don't use DRM at all
</code></pre>
I don't think that option 4 is realistic in the near term, as much as we'd like. Maybe one day we can get there like with music. I do think that TV and Movies are a much different market, where rental is more attractive than purchase, so it might not be totally viable.<p>That leaves native apps, plugins, and DRM support in HTML. Can anyone who thinks the web model is the best way to deliver content and apps reasonably argue that DRM in HTML _isn't_ the best of those?<p>For more fringe platforms, a standard like EME is the only hope for support from mainstream contest providers. Without something like EME you're at the mercy of the providers cost / benefit analysis: are there enough paying users on your platform to justify the costs of supporting it. With EME you're at the mercy of the platforms cost / benefit analysis: are there enough users of all the content providers to justify supporting EME. That is more likely to be true.<p>Yes, there are problems with supporting fully open systems, but those were there anyway, without EME. If you choose to only run OSS without hardware DRM you might have trouble watching Netflix. My guess is that that's ok with you on principle.",1368219989

That alone would require more effort than it was worth to cook them.<p>I'm not poor, but I've definitely gone through a rough period or two in my past.  During those periods I managed to eat pretty healthy, but it required a fairly decent amount of planning, and there were days when I had to make due with a cup of rice or nothing at all to make the budget work.  I am talking about situations where I did not have enough money in the bank account on the day rent was due, and the credit cards were already maxed out.  I was working, but the work was intermittent and unreliable (and very labor intensive).  So I had time to ride my bike to multiple stores and get the cheapest food, and I had time to cook meals.  I lived in a single room, shared house, so couldn't 'downsize' my living any more than it already was.<p>Once I got a 'real' job, things obviously improved dramatically, but keep in mind I had a college degree, so that was an easy transition to make.  I look back fondly on that period, but have the luxury to do so because I always knew that it would be a temporary situation.<p>For the 'real' poor, they often live in areas where riding a bike to multiple stores to get the best deals is impossible.  They often have to settle for fast food because their kids are hungry now, and they don't have enough money in the bank account to invest in groceries (i.e. spending $100 on groceries isn't possible, while spending $10 on fast food is, even if groceries are the better long term investment).  Their employment situation tends to be fairly unstable, i.e. they work a lot some days/weeks, and little to no work on others.  This means that they have to spend a LOT of effort trying to find work (and obviously, they are not getting paid while they do this).<p>Just to go through your points:
- TV is often the cheapest form of entertainment for their kids.  So if they get rid of the TV, then what?  Take the kids to Laser Tag?
- I didn't have internet when I was poor, somehow I have a feeling a lot of poor people are in the same boat.
-From my experience, almost every one is using public transportation.  Cars are a huge risk and require significant financial overhead.  One mechanical issue could break the budget.  Carpooling is very much a middle class luxury.
- They probably live in subsidized housing already, so moving is not really something they can control.
- They also probably have very limited employment options, which is part of the reason they are poor to begin with.  Also see my previous comment on unstable work situations.
-I think one of the biggest misconceptions about the poor, is that people see that they have a TV or an xbox or some kids toys and assume that because they can afford those 'luxury' items, that they must be able to afford other things.  But the fact is, these durable consumer goods are fairly cheap when compared to the ongoing costs of shelter, food, insurance, etc..  But more importantly, credit companies and payday companies and financing schemes are overwhelmingly targeting the poor.  They do this because they know they can get away with charging unreasonable rates.  Often this results in a poor person making a few bad financial decisions, and subsequently getting trapped under the weight of the consequences (maxed out credit cards, debt collectors, etc..)<p>The fact is, on a micro level, any individual is capable of escaping poverty.  If they work hard and make good financial decisions, and don't run into any bad luck, they can do it.  But on a macro level, the poor as a whole face systematic pressures that make it very difficult to escape poverty.  One or two financial missteps can put them in a hole that is nearly impossible to recover from.  Telling people to 'work hard' or 'eat healthy' or 'be financially responsible' ignores the systematic pressures that they face that make all of these things extremely difficult if not impossible.",1368219851

How many times do you want to add numbers together? The result is multiplication. Similarly, addition can be used to represent multiplication. You want to multiply, which can be represented as adding things a certain number of times.<p>Of course, the conjecture introduces rules about prime numbers, and then says ""ooo"" now we see that prime numbers being added together (with rules of what kinds of prime numbers are allowed in the equation) results in ""predictable"" rates of incidence.<p>I guess it's a little late to go back and be born again with a life of education centered around number theory so I could see and comprehend the complexity!",1368219668

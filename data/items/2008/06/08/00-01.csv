It also looks bad when the browser doesn't do a good job of aligning the favicon with the text next to it. I have exactly the same problem with my favicon and it isn't easy to work around without going with a whole new design.<p>Anyway, did they do end-user tests on this design? I would be very surprised if the results of a marketing/usability test support this change.",1212886746
211796,comment,211747,211747,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Is it really a bigger feat to encrypt with a 1024-bits encryption key than a 660-bits one? If not I don't understand why they didn't do 1024 in the first place. Or even why not use a 2048-bits one...<p>Given the situation the scammer probably doesn't care about performance, so might as well mitigate any attempts at decryption.",1212886708

My one concern with PHP is the overwhelming ""alphabet soup"" of functions.<p>I haven't done anything web-facing with Python just yet, just using it to; parse files, some socket programming - basically getting a feel for the language.<p>So far, I couldn't say I've run into any issues resulting directly from the languages themselves.<p>Thanks for the input.",1212886666

211792,comment,211782,211782,0,0,rms,,,"Python...    both languages are along far enough that they will meet all four of your points, but people that program in python are on average better programmers than PHP programmers. So it makes hiring good hackers easier by eliminating many of the bad hackers.<p>Other than that, if you like the syntax of PHP, it is as good as python as long as you program using the MVC paradigm. Personally I like the syntax of python a whole lot more than PHP.",1212886349
211791,comment,211782,211782,0,0,underscore,,,"What are your feelings as a beginner in each language? Have you found any little design decisions that leave you scratching your head, or make you start cursing loudly at the computer? Have you built anything with them? If so, did you run into any issues that you feel were a result of the language?<p>I'm a bit of a hedonist, but if I were in your situation, I'd probably try to pick the one that was the most fun to work with. As you say, once you've started building, it won't be (or maybe for you it will be?) as easy to switch, and you probably don't want to figure out that you hate coding in whatever you've chosen while trying to finish your web app.<p>When in a variant of your situation (PHP/a PHP framework versus Python/Django), I chose Python. I'm not you, so we may have totally different tastes and may have come to a different conclusion given the facts. I've been pretty happy with my choice, though.",1212886158

211789,comment,211782,211782,0,0,iamdave,,,">calendar/scheduling/notifications with some <i>social networking</i><p>Why?<p>More and more web apps are coming out with social networking tied in, and very few of them succeed BECAUSE they have social networking tied in.  Socializing a site is a bit more than giving people profile pages and enabling them the ability to ""friend"" people, at least that's how I look at it.<p>So my question to you is this: how are you planning to make the social aspect of your site actually work?  How are you going to make the ad hoc benefits of social networking replicate to an online presence?  Will people actually benefit from socializing, or are they just going to have friends who they will have the extraneous ability to leave comments about?",1212886090

Virtually  any form of payment is traceable today and if you can pay with a CC, you can complain to your CC company about fraud and get your money back.

You can get decent results, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you really <i>are</i> performance-constrained.  You end up spending a lot more time than you'd like on browser-specific bugs.  If you're just trying to put up a UI to respond to your user's clicks, you're much better off with a lightweight X-platform library like JQuery or Base2.",1212885962

211785,comment,211782,211782,0,0,jrockway,,,"Why throw away Perl?  You already know Perl, and Perl has lots of things that PHP and Python don't.  Before you ditch Perl, look at DBIx::Class, Moose, and Catalyst.  And the other 10,000 libraries on CPAN.<p>Then look at the 500 or so libraries available for PHP.<p>Perl has a really insane library culture, and it's very hard to give that up.  I like the syntax of other languages better (Lisp is my favorite), but it's hard to give up the millions of hours of free work called the CPAN.  Perl also has great tools for testing (see how many Test:: modules there are), and it has a <i>culture</i> of testing.  So the libraries you download from the CPAN aren't some untested i-hacked-it-together-while-drunk snippets of code; they're all very carefully tested.  What it boils down to is that when you move your app from development to production, you'll be reasonably sure that your libraries (and app) still work.<p>One line summary: Perl has more features and libraries than the alternatives, <i>and</i> you already know it!  I think the choice is a no-brainer.",1212885518

Capable of scaling quite well.<p>Python and PHP score well on all four of these points.<p>I am about to embark on building a web app;   calendar/scheduling/notifications with some social networking and people matching/search functionality.

You're stating an opinion, not an argument.<p>Surely you would agree that Google's logo is an important part of their visual identity -- I think the favicon fits into that. It is seen billions of times every single day, shows up in bookmarks for the site, and will likely be propagated to many other sites that need logos/images for stories about Google.",1212884624

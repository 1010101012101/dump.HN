Technology has advanced to a point where we can now watch movies in our flat screens with DVD like qualities from streaming. Mailing out DVD's are costly to the company. The change in price is designed to encourage streaming in my opinion. The more people sign up for the streaming service the more movies they can afford to upload for people to watch. In the long run I think this is a really good strategy. The price increase should have been a little lower though.",1316120277

The only thing that will happen is a lot of tourists will flock down and the street will get even more clogged than it is for traffic and some arrests. People try to protest here all the time. It's nothing new.

My project Flatland[1] is intended to be a 2D games library, providing graphics, audio, input, content loading, and a few other bits. My target platforms are Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and WP7.<p>With a properly architected solution (and I like to think mine comes close) with sufficient abstraction, I literally <i>can</i> write a game once--with allowances for fundamental platform differences, i.e. ""is this a touch device? then show on-screen controls, but wire them to the same backend logic""--and deploy it everywhere. I can't do that with a Java engine on Android and an Obj-C (ugh) engine on iOS, because there is no reasonable lingua franca. C#, on the other hand, works fairly well everywhere. The platform-specific bits are small, clearly delineated, and shouldn't take long to do (it's Windows-only for now).<p>[1] - <a href=""http://bitbucket.org/eropple/flatland"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitbucket.org/eropple/flatland</a>",1316120127

I bought Starbucks right after they got hammered for closing a bunch of stores a few years ago and it did really well.<p>But their price/earnings ratio is still 42.86, which seems high. For perspective, Microsoft is at 9.99 <i>(disclaimer: I own some)</i> and Apple is at 15.56.<p>That means Netflix could double their earnings, and still cost more on a per earning basis than Apple. I just don't see it as a good buy, especially with some tough competitors in streaming content like Amazon, Apple, Hulu, etc.<p>It seems to me like there's lots of very solid buys that are undervalued, going for a sexy industry with a high P/E, no dividend, not much in the way of patents or strong assets, and tough competitors... yeah, I think Netflix is a brilliant company, but I'm not buying their stock at these prices.",1316120054

Make no mistake that the studios are already working on deals that will bleed netflix dry. They will look to squeeze every last penny of profit out of the streaming division.

Its functionality designated on all the aspects of modern developing. Moreover, its extremely fast (particularly interactions with the DOM).<p>All the popular methods from popular frameworks (interactions with the DOM, Ajax and so on) also attend in Prevel but without ballast, because, basically, using heavy frameworks consists of using searching through the DOM and creating Ajax requests.<p>Including a framework which size is 90 Kb on a page which entire size (without a framework) is 20 Kb is a bad tone. But when writing in pure JavaScript arise a few inconveniences connected with that in JavaScript there are no habitual functions such as $() or $.ajax() and so on; Prevel called to root this problem as an essence by having a clear API and by rapid speed of work.<p>Perhaps you will say that 200 Kb is not a problem nowadays, but there are still lots of people who dont use the broadband Internet connection. Furthermore, Prevel is quite faster than newfangled frameworks such as jQuery, Mootools, Prototype, etc. Today, in a milestone of interactivity, speed is incredibly important.<p>In addition, you can make Prevel smaller; to do this its necessary just to assemble it from modules independently.<p>=================<p>Examples of usage<p>Probably youll like it after watching on a few examples (not all the functionality).<p>Ajax:
Ajax attends almost in every application, Prevel simplifies a process of creating requests. Structure of creating queries is like its in jQuery (object with url, type, ...). More detailed instructions are available in documentation.<p>pl.ajax({
  url: prevelAjaxTest.py,
  type: GET,
  success: function(data) {
    alert(Okay.);

 opacity: 0.5
});<p>Common:
This methods are available from the `pl` namespace.<p>Defining the type of an object.<p>pl.type(Lorem.) === str
pl.type([]) === arr
pl.type({}) === obj

pl.type(/abc/g) === regexp<p>Defining a browser name. Supported browsers: chrome, opera, firefox, ie, ie6, ie7, ie8, safari, safari_khtml.<p>pl.browser(); // Name of current browser<p>If you suddenly liked Prevel Framework, you could read documentation. By the way, its necessary to emphasise one pleasant particularity: call chains supported (e.g. pl(div).after(...).before(...)).<p>On GitHub: https://github.com/chernikovalexey/Prevel",1316119986

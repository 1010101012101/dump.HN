8309398,comment,8306927,8306927,1,0,Brian-Puccio,,,"I hear you. I like taking photos. I like seeing my photos. I hate post-processing and organizing. It sounds like you&#x27;re like me in that you wanted to go from taking the photo to &quot;finished product&quot; with as little in between as possible.<p>A rangefinder (start with a Bessa, not a Leica, if you want a RF) and slide film did wonders. I take the photos and I&#x27;m deliberate about it. I mail it off to a lab and a few days later I get back mounted slides. I can toss the bad ones, throw the good ones into a projector and I&#x27;m enjoying my photos. Beautiful, wall-size photos glowing in my face.<p>I love Provia, others consider it too cold, especially in shadows. A cheap filter compensates or try other film. Velvia is a bit more special purpose but when used right, it&#x27;s just wonderful.<p>Many people think that post-processing photos only became a thing with digital photography. That&#x27;s certainly not the case. If you were in a dark room, you were editing your photos by burning and dodging (ever wonder why Adobe picked those icons in Photoshop?). Here are some examples: <a href=""https://fstoppers.com/post-production/how-photos-were-edited-darkroom-days-2994"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fstoppers.com/post-production/how-photos-were-edited...</a><p>At a simpler level, if you want to avoid all of the middle work, there&#x27;s Fuji Instax. You lose control over DoF, exposure, etc. But you go from taking a photo to having it in your hands in seconds. I got one because I wanted printed snapshots, but couldn&#x27;t even bring myself to just quickly print a photo, I&#x27;d spend too much time messing around.<p>Want more control? Large format camera with Fuji instant film (that&#x27;s something that won&#x27;t be around much longer, but there&#x27;s the New55 kickstarter). Get a camera with movements and you&#x27;ll have more control over your photography than you ever could have with an SLR.",1410544640

For example, we don&#x27;t surge, and a substantial number of our customers report that they only use us when Uber and Lyft are surging.<p>There&#x27;s also a time-frame issue here.  The number of users who check different services with every ride is low.  The number of users who check different services when their primary service is surging is higher.  The number of users who are open to occasionally checking out other services if they hear good things is higher yet.<p>Cost-insensitive users who have Uber brand loyalty may be a large rump population for Uber -- they were the original adopters of the service.

OSX, Linux, Windows, and every other OS has been based on the system of files and folders and filenames and crap like that. I&#x27;m not too versed in computer history. Has anyone ever tried making a computer system that does not use files?<p>In my opinion, referring to the data that computers deal with as &quot;files&quot; made sense in 1954 when every large company had a &quot;paper file system&quot;, but in 2014, I think its time to come up with a new system that better mirrors how we use computers.<p>I&#x27;m working on a project I&#x27;m calling &quot;Library Transfer Protocol&quot;, which is aiming to replace the concept of &quot;file&quot; and replacing it with &#x27;Library item&#x27;.

Thats one of the things I tried to tackle in Obvious (<a href=""http://retromocha.com/obvious/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retromocha.com/obvious/</a>) but readability is a human/social/communication problem.<p>Programming as it is now is a 2 way communication mechanism, we are writing code for other humans to understand, but for a machine to translate into what we intend for the machine to execute.<p>So, your point of making code a better human to human communication mechanism is absolutely correct.<p>What I really wonder about is what set of tools could exist that could solve whole sets of low level problems that we are specifying now that we shouldn&#x27;t. Sort of like, right now we have blueprints and so on, and then humans look at those and build a house. Yet, with 3-D printed houses, you feed a set of materials and specifications into a machine, and you get a house built for you.<p>What is the programming equivalent that would allow us to &quot;3-D print&quot; software, so to speak? For physical things, it seems to be the combination of 3-D CAD systems, 3-D printers, and maybe some thought about how things need to be designed to fit this approach.<p>I have no idea exactly, but I could see a future where instead of paying people to hand craft all the code, that a series of features, modules, structure, etc. are specified, and the software is just &quot;built&quot;. There would be more effort in the specification, but less on the build.",1410544630

They&#x27;re upset about sometimes getting trips from uberx (and apparently making more doing so), so they&#x27;re going to a place that pays less per trip and per hour? Something doesn&#x27;t add up there.<p>If there was a factual claim here, I have to believe that they&#x27;d be sharing their numbers. It would be trivial for them to show a decrease in earnings (they can easily calculate gas and wear-and-tear) in the before-and-after earnings. The fact that that isn&#x27;t happening makes me believe this is similar to the protests last year in SF. From the reports back then, it ended up being mostly drivers who had been banned from the uber platform who were trying to be reinstated (although that&#x27;s not what they claimed).",1410544533

8309381,comment,8308666,8308666,4,0,zeratul,,,"S.A. is talking about general-purpose AI (position 2 in the RFS). This means processing natural language. There is a lot of progress but it&#x27;s just slow so it&#x27;s almost invisible.<p>Also it&#x27;s a very difficult field of science. Now you need to be proficient in AI, machine learning, computational linguistics, linguistic corpora research, cognitive sciences, statistics, and sometimes physics if the text changes over time. Of course, you also need to be a good programmer. This combination of skills is very rare. Thus, very slow progress.<p>I suggest to start with well defined practical problems. For example, no one seems to do much with user generated reviews. There is some sentiment analysis but that is just a binary text categorization problem - not even close to general purpose AI.<p>It would be much more interesting to show a seller a time ordered stream of clustered reviews that depict only the most representative review for each cluster. This way a seller  can see how his/her fixes/changes impact user reviews. Also it would be a great source for features and bug fixes requests. This is an ideal testing bed for clustering, novelty detection, categorization and mild inference. The inference is required because of sparseness of data.<p>This would create a good data set for a more general purpose AI. We would have reviews and text documenting changes and improvements of a new version of a product. Now the computer could start learning the dialog between users and product developers. Then, we are just one more step from statistical inference based question-answering system. Not a brute force system like &quot;Watson&quot; or a hand crafted rule base system like &quot;Siri&quot;.<p>[EDIT:] I was thinking more about a decision support system that can recommend product changes. But in a way that maximizes customer satisfaction and minimizes the cost of implementation. The dialogue between past changes and customer reaction would give us the surface that needs to be optimized. This would generalize well to other domains where there is a text for request and a text for response - just to name one: clinical text in healthcare (position 5 in the RFS).",1410544490

As for your response to dragonwriter, you appear to be talking past one another; of course markets are matchmaking services for buyers and sellers by definition, but what you&#x27;ve done here is mistake this specific case of relatively frictionless movement between employers increasing the surplus of the employees for an indictment of regulation in general.<p>This particular case seems to realize said friction (and consequently, the surplus/benefit for the drivers) precisely because the service itself being offered by Lyft/Uber is market like, and the end-consumer product is in fact offered by the drivers themselves. It is not clear to me (or the others disagreeing with you here evidently) that regulation has any bearing on this conversation -- in a world where both Lyft and Uber&#x27;s respective operations are regulated by the state, the power is still in the drivers&#x27; hands because Lyft and Uber are competing to offer the drivers&#x27; services.<p>This is not exactly the common formula for most employee-employer relationships, although it may become more common as this business model takes off. What dragonwriter seems to be saying IMO is that there are certainly cases that don&#x27;t fit this mold that are good arguments for state intervention; among them are cases where there is greater friction for the employees themselves due to the nature of the business; lack of information about compensation, working hours, or other metrics to evaluate the given positions; or, as dragonwriter said, physical proximity to the workplace itself.<p>If you would be so kind, please elucidate how you feel this particular seemingly unique scenario is generalizable to regulation in general.<p>PS: Apologies if this is wordy and difficult to follow, I have a hard time writing coherently into this tiny box.",1410544080
8309345,comment,8302548,8306469,1,0,rayiner,,,"I spent several comments laying out a theory for the increased incarceration rates, supported with charts and graphs.<p>The bottom line is that the increase in incarceration rates is the result of a dramatic spike in crime rates starting in 1960, peaking in the early 1990&#x27;s, and the public response in the form of harsh sentencing laws in the 1990&#x27;s (three strikes, mandatory minimums). It&#x27;s a simple explanation: there are more people in prison because there is more crime, and because the spike in crime caused people to vote (by overwhelming margins, I might add) for harsher sentencing laws.<p>Compare incarceration rates with violent crime rates: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/U.S._inca...</a>, <a href=""http://www.volokh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/vcrime500.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volokh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/vcrime500.j...</a>. You can see that incarceration rates are clearly a lagging indicator, not a leading indicator. Violent crime peaked in 1993, at 4.3x the 1960 baseline. Incarceration peaked in 2005, at 4.8x the 1960 baseline. It&#x27;s not until the late 1990&#x27;s that incarceration rates catch up with violent crime rates.<p>The popular counterargument is that the increase in crime is itself a result of the social effects of the Drug War, e.g. the impact on kids of fathers being sent to prison for decades on drug charges. But the Anti-Drug Abuse Act was passed in 1986, and the spike in violent crime rates started in 1960. The slope of the crime increase between 1966 and 1972 is as high as at any time after the drug war really got going in the 1980&#x27;s, and 80% of the total increase in crime between the 1960 trough and the 1993 peak happened by 1980. It is simply inconsistent with the data to say that the increase in crime since 1960 were anything more than moderately impacted by the Drug War, which didn&#x27;t really get going until long after crime had already skyrocketed.",1410544069

This will mean debit cards would be used day-to-day by most people, and credit cards only when the financing is actually required (not as it is now where many, including myself, use credit cards for everything due to the rewards and pay in full).

If it ends up bigger, you chose wisely and/or got lucky, and deserve to retire comfortably. If it ends up a lot bigger, you chose brilliantly and/or got really lucky, and deserve to retire in luxury.

Similarly,  what a government run pension fund can attain in another country is unrelated to what one can attain in the US.<p>I agree with the part about stagnant real incomes,  which meshes with the rising cost of health insurance,  housing and college,  but I don&#x27;t think professional pension fund managers do that much better than individuals in the long term.  They may avoid stupid mistakes like selling all of your shares in the winter of 2008-2009,  but the real advantage pensions have is that they can borrow from peter to pay paul,  at least in the short term.",1410542487

In an ideal world, a pos could publish a message like &quot;transaction #N initiated for $X&quot; to some &quot;payment bus&quot;.

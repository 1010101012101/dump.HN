We assumed it was benign ""technical debt"" -- a bad technical situation that can be paid off later when resources are less scarce.<p>What we didn't count on was the meltdown of the person responsible for the problematic code. In hindsight, we should have seen it coming, but it seems like there are always things going wrong in a startup, and <i>everything</i> seems urgent.<p>I've wanted for a while to fire this guy, throw out his code, and rebuild everything from scratch, but have been under the impression that we don't have the time/turning room to do this.

Or E is infertile. And while A + B makes C and even D and E, the fact that the lines eventually terminate means A and B are reproductively isolated.<p><i>The foals would be mostly horse, and the result of that is an animal that is 3/4 horse which therefore is likely to be able to breed with other horses.</i><p>Not so.<p>It is true that once in a million a fertile mule is born, but that mule's offspring are not fertile, or its grandchildren are not fertile. Mules have been bred throughout history, but I know of no line of mostly donkey or horse hybrids with a fertile mule parent, or gand, or grand-grand-grand parent, or any mule linage.<p><i>and by chance on 2 occasions fertile offspring</i><p>But that in no way guarantees THEIR offspring with either Humans or Neanderthals (or other hybrids) would be fertile or that their grandchildren would be.<p>And if they were, then by definition us and Neanderthals are the same species.<p>And in that case I still don't understand how there could be so little genetic difference contributed.<p>For sweet zombie jesus' sake, we can identify the descendants of a Central Asian male who lived around the time of Genghis Khan over most of Eurasia.

I see wikipedia and facebook just about as opposite poles on the line of what the web could be like if we all cooperated with each other versus if we try to see how much we can screw each other over.<p>What worries me mostly is that by making more and more commercial ties that wikipedia will lose its independence, and will be beholden to those that fund it, and possibly no longer able to see clearly.<p>I think I'd have less of a problem with an adsense block on wikipedias pages than with these syndication deals, the fact that they could happen anyway (without benefits) doesn't really diminish that in my view.",1273243544

Thus far, all hires have been developers, but we're getting ready to make our first non-technical hire, a social media manager.<p>I get the impression that there is a glut of non-technical ""business"" people trying to get hired by startups.  Therefore, I assume we can pay this person substantially less than we'd pay an entry-level developer.  We'll still give him/her the same amount of options that we give all technical folks we've hired.<p>Is that correct?  How much should an entry-level social media manager make in NYC?",1273241184

For one thing, in almost all versions of the story, including the ostensibly documented one in the Jargon File, the computer is a VAX; at the time a VAX would have been a very unusual platform for this kind of data acquisition (they used PDP-11s). The Toronto zoology department has never been licensed to work with primates; the only section of the university that could have done experiments of this nature was the School of Medicine.

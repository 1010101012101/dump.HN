10251302,comment,10250803,10251273,0,0,kozukumi,,,"This is the number one problem I have with Android. Once I buy an Android phone I pretty much expect 6 months of updates. Maybe longer if it is a really big bug. Sure some OEMs have made &quot;promises&quot; to provide 2 years of updates but that updates don&#x27;t come out all that quickly, often several months after it hits the main AOSP line.<p>If you want an iOS like experience with Android you have to buy a Nexus phone of which the Nexus 6 sucked balls due to its size.<p>I wish Google hadn&#x27;t killed the Play Edition phones. I would love a choice of phones running stock Android, maybe with a few extra, optional, apps from the OEM similar to what Motorola does. A Galaxy S6 running stock Android with a guarantee of update within 2 weeks of it hitting a Nexus would be my perfect phone.",1442829569

For stationary devices this is much less of a concern, the long term killer there is contact oxidization. Since CPU contacts are made of gold this is not usually a source of concern. Even circuit boards made in the 70&#x27;s with regular sockets still function fine today, the &#x27;bad&#x27; parts are usually electrolytic capacitors (they dry out) and tantalum ones (they like to change into miniature fireworks).",1442829499

The Textron AirLand Scorpion, built from off the shelf parts, designed to take a whole bunch of ordinary weapons systems, went from design to flying at air shows inside 3 years, without massive costs. It&#x27;s a subsonic, twin jet plane with a stall speed around 100 knots, which costs ~$20m.<p>It&#x27;s not remotely clever compared to the Eurofighter, Sukhoi Su-XX jets or similar recent generation multi-role aircraft, but for low speed engagement with flexible hardpoints and easy maintenance, it&#x27;s hard to find many competitors.

It&#x27;s lottery because there are too many applications. Without an advanced degree the chances are 40-50% I believe.<p>I agree that going to university in the US is easiest way, but it&#x27;s also quite expensive. And there&#x27;s no guarantee that you would get a visa after that. In fact, many of my friends were forced to go back to their country after finishing their full degree in the US because they couldn&#x27;t get an H1B, and that includes those who went to highly-ranked universities.<p>IMO your best chance (besides marriage) may be to 1. Get an advanced degree and 2. Build a highly valuable skillset that US companies are looking for. App/Web development is great, but there are many people who can do that and you&#x27;d need to be extraordinary for any startup to go through the trouble of sponsoring an H1B. On the other side of this are PhDs who solve hard problems at big companies.

But then we just pick a few pieces and a whole 5 person dinner amounts to just 300 to 500 grams of meat. And we never eat it &quot;plain and juicy&quot;, it is always cooked with veggies, mushrooms, etc.<p>It is very different from the extremes I heard about in the US: on one side you have those 1kg/pers steak houses, which are meat orgies that should only be allowed once or thrice in a life. On the other side all veggies variants, and soylent. Is there really no way to take food as a normal thing in the US?

How many things the other side has to accept from you that they consider really bad?

How many of them are even like that? Maybe most of them also disagree with raping boys but somehow can&#x27;t enforce it? Can you even choose to not cooperate or will the people above you not allow it? It is very complex and should not be answered in general. Sometimes even every decision is bad.

So there&#x27;s no lens of morality to view things with.  What happened in both cases is that it&#x27;s a crime that has grown due to widespread corruption.

If you care about that, ask me how I prefer to dress and I'll tell you an anecdote about me getting married in a Star Wars tee. That I wear a suit to your interview is a big change.<p>2) A skill to tie a bow tie doesn't translate to anything valuable (except to tie a bow tie)..<p>3) Being different just for the sake of standing out can be archived in a number of ways and the opposite of coming with a bow tie (? Maybe wearing the a short of your favorite sports team?) would archive _that_ just as easily.<p>My prejudices?<p>Suit is already a little over the top.

5115976,comment,5107264,5113964,1,0,dpark,,,"><i>I'm making the assertion that people who are drawn to computers, especially those who began at a young age, have differently wired brains from the population average, and that this preference for computing fields may be associated with reduced capacity for empathy.</i><p>And I'm saying that this is not true.  Sure, there some very small proportion of the computing industry that have trouble with empathy, but there is a very small proportion of the population in general that has this problem.  Even if the computing field had twice as many people with this issue as the general population, it would still be a small portion of the overall computing field.  (And I seriously doubt that it's twice the average.  I've never seen anything substantive demonstrating that it is more prevalent at all.)<p>> <i>You're already talking about someone who is acting like a jerk. Becoming confrontational is the last thing I would expect to convince anyone to want to change their behavior, much less a ""jerk.""</i><p>First, there are many different levels of ""confrontation"".  Telling someone that they've hurt your feelings can be viewed as confrontational, but is much different than yelling at someone and calling them an asshole.  Second, if someone is unwilling to acknowledge that their behavior is inappropriate, they are certainly not going to try to change.  Someone who sees no problem with their behavior sees no reason to alter it.<p>> <i>""Dismissing"" isn't the right word. Again you seem to assume that I intend to excuse inappropriate behavior and that I expect it to continue. That is not the case. I am proposing a more rational, less reactive approach to persuading people to be more considerate.</i><p>You're proposing that we concede that asshole behaviors by people in the tech world are largely due to an inability to empathize.  I don't think there's any basis in fact for this claim, so this can not inform an rational approach to resolving the problem.<p>> <i>a piece of code.</i><p>Code doesn't have feelings, and the inappropriate behavior was not toward the code.<p>> <i>Is this a new analog of Godwin's law? If you wouldn't talk about it w/r/t race or sex or gender, you can't talk about it at all?</i><p>Is every metaphor now somehow a meta-invocation of Godwin's law?<p>Let's talk about racism, though.  It's absolutely true that there are people with syndromes (e.g. Tourette's) who shout racial slurs because of their diseases.  It is not, however, useful to bring up Tourette's in a conversation about racism, because while it does explain why a tiny portion of society might appear racist to the uninformed, it says nothing at all about the actual issue, because the vast, vast majority of racists do not have Tourette's.<p>> <i>I would consider those to be less situational explanations, at least the way you've worded them.</i><p>You think that explanations that involve situational context are <i>less situational</i> than explanations that are entirely internal to personality?  I really don't understand how you can make this claim.<p>> <i>I've avoided reading the original tweets at issue, so all I'm aware of is that the metaphor of bleeding eyes was used, which is common and inoffensive among nerds.</i><p>It's common.  That doesn't make it inoffensive.  If I say that your clothes are making my eyes bleed, then I'm telling you that your clothes are horrible to a level that has caused me physical damage.  This is offensive.",1359129563

This was originally a partnership I helped create with Pew and Google back in 2008 (now expanded to include MS and others as well, wonderfully):<p><a href=""https://votinginfoproject.org/about"" rel=""nofollow"">https://votinginfoproject.org/about</a><p>After 4+ years, we now have a large number of states voting information  online and free.\nA large number of people at various states also put their asses on the line to help make this happen over the years .  I wish I could give them medals.\n:)<p>There are other example, like patent data, etc. To be honest, i'd rather us stay behind the scenes and just have the info released, even if it means people never know we were involved. It prevents a lot of issues from people who make large amounts of money off data that should be public and open.  Of course, there are times/cases where it makes sense to use our name and brand to help, and when necessary, we do that.<p>We also fund plenty of non-profit orgs, including folks like Carl.  But getting traction is simply not that easy.  A lot of government agencies make revenue from data they publish by selling subscriptions to it or otherwise charging. They don't want to give it to you if your plan is to open it up, even if you are willing to pay large sums.  I can't often blame them. Congress cares more about seeing agencies budget neutral than they do about ""open data"".<p>There were also mandates that public datasets be cataloged sanely and released. This led to data.gov. However, because of the way it worked some agencies had some perverse incentives, like ""release the most datasets"".\nThis led to humorous things like every single separate piece of data being published as its own dataset on data.gov, which had no good search, making parts of it entirely useless.<p>Anyway, the short answer is: We're trying. We've been trying.",1359129554

While there are seasonal effects, looking at the price over a number of years gives you a good picture as to the actual inflation.<p>The key thing here, though, is ""fixed"".  Sometimes companies will make adjustments to the product to reduce costs, and those adjustments make the apparent inflation appear lower than they really are.  For example, a jeweler can quote the same price for jewelry next year (assuming gold price rises) if they use less gold and more base metals in the jewelry.

Yes, in general the defense bar would like a world in which fewer charges can be brought, because there are fewer crimes defined by statute, and pleas of guilty are less costly, because fewer charges result in severe sentences. The criminal prosecution bar would like a world in which charges and pleas reflect the general reality of who is causing societal harm (as society currently defines that) without massively burdensome trials. The general public just want to do what they feel is right, untroubled by people they think are wrong-doers (to them).<p>The Economist, a publication I generally like to read (I subscribe to the print edition) tends to take a position that ""decriminalization"" (their word choice is not usually ""legalization"") of many currently illegal drugs would be a helpful social policy around the world. That may be. Richard Branson's blog post ""Time to end the war on drugs"" from a little more than a year ago about Portugal<p><a href=""http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/blog/time-to-end-the-war-on-drugs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/blog/time-to-end-the-w...</a><p>suggests that Portugal's policy of decriminalization with administratively mandatory treatment<p><a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/top-10-marijuana-myths-and-facts-20120822/myth-holland-and-portugal-have-legalized-marijuana-19691231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/top-10-marijuana-m...</a><p>reduces drug use in Portugal while reducing burden on the criminal justice system.<p>Coming back to the submitted article's last suggestion, ""A more sensible idea would be to require the state to provide the defence with all its evidenceparticularly any exculpatory evidenceduring the plea process, rather than simply during or before trial,"" it is mandatory in the United States for the prosecution to share its evidence with the defense before trial. Failure to do that can result in the reversal of a conviction. But a defendant like Aaron Swartz was able to lawyer up enough, and do enough pretrial investigation, to be quite aware of what exculpatory evidence was on his side. He had other channels for protesting about the issues that concerned him, and he had the choice before him of doing what Thoreau, Gandhi, and King did of protesting a law he thought was unjust by publicly accepting imprisonment for it after a trial. Even after criminal law reform, there are still going to be people who think that their approach to solving personal problems shouldn't be subject to criminal sanctions, with laws still being on the books against their overt behavior. This problem of many possible charges and a drive on both sides in the criminal justice system to bargain can be reduced, but it cannot be eliminated, maybe especially in cases like that of Aaron Swartz.",1359126983

Governments don't have to default if they inflate their debt away.<p>Also, money is just pieces of paper or a number in a computer. You shouldn't keep most of your savings in money. Cash is just an agreed upon number meant to help with short term transactions. It's a tool for trading. You don't have real savings until you have something more err... real, like stocks or actual stuff. Inflation can't touch that. If you feel bonds don't offer a good enough return given inflation risks just don't buy bonds! No reason to panic. The world GDP won't drop 25% unless we run out of key natural resources or face some kind of catastrophe, things that would happen regardless of ""socialism"".<p>Government debt matters but not in the way you seem to think.",1359126462

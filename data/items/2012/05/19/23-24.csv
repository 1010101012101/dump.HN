3997443,comment,3997030,3997030,10,0,vibrunazo,,,"For those not aware. There's a running joke in the skepticism community, that in the next few years we're gonna have baby mammoths flying around in jetpacks [1]. That's because stories of both mammoth cloning and jetpacks in development keep coming back on the media. Every other year we hear about a new exciting research about either of these, but not only they never delivered, we also haven't seen any real evidence that we have the technology for either of them to become a reality in the near future.<p>Both jetpacks and baby mammoth share a common problem. They're both things we have already theorized as possible. So we do know we can do it, any research on them could be legit. But there are way too many little technical details in the way to actually make them happen. In the case of cloning mammoths, there are just thousands of little things that could go wrong. From your DNA sample not being as good as you thought, or the womb condition of the elephant not being as appropriate for a mammoth as you thought. To the big elephant in the room (sorry) that is, even if you perfect the technique (we didn't), and happen to successfully give birth to a new baby from mammoth DNA. That new baby is actually not a mammoth. But a mammoth-elephant hybrid. That would be like mating a German Shepard with a Poodle, getting a short dog with curly hair, but with a hair color that resembles the Shepard. And saying ""here's a German Shepard"". Well, not really. If you really want an actual mammoth that is, at least, very close to a mammoth with little elephant DNA in it. You'll need to reclone that new baby with more mammoth DNA. Even if you assume perfect cloning technique and infinite samples of perfect mammoth DNA. Considering the pregnancy time for elephants. It could take centuries to have an actual mammoth.<p>So yea, it's exciting research, we love to see it, and it's sure something viable that may become true in the future. But don't get too excited just yet. The correct skeptic stance would be to assume they might succeed, but their chances are very slim to at best, move forward some baby steps in technology. But since that's probably not the best stance to get your research funded, we'll keep hearing about exciting new breakthroughs in baby mammoths flying on jetpacks on the media every other year.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.skepticalrobot.com/products/Jetpack-Mammoth-Tee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skepticalrobot.com/products/Jetpack-Mammoth-Tee.h...</a>",1337471189

Place a compliant material on top of the board (e.g., firm foam rubber). Flip board over and solder all components. Put iron down. Cut leads. Flip board over and repeat for next highest components.<p>This minimizes the number of tool swaps and handling and is very fast.<p>That said: I much prefer SMT soldering and I don't even use an iron anymore, even for just one board: manually dispense paste on all the pads.

It amazes me that in the ugly vs. beautiful category, the article uses this as the beautiful:<p><pre><code>   return [i/2 for i in nums if not i % 2]\n</code></pre>\n""not i % 2""? That's beautiful? We do a division and ask whether the remainder is not true? What does it mean for a remainder of a division to be not true? Is sqrt(3) untrue? Is 17 not yellow? Is this really the clearest way to say even number?<p>Yes, after years of working in C, I'm well aware of how C does bools, but that's because C's values are small and fast, not beautiful and clear. In C, there's barely any abstraction to leak--you just manipulate bits and don't worry about mixing your metaphors. But Python has different priorities, which is why I prefer it to C when my users (and I) won't be hurt by the performance difference.<p>If we're showing off clarity instead of cleverness, wouldn't <i>this</i> be a better way to demonstrate it:<p><pre><code>   return [i/2 for i in nums if i%2 == 0]\n</code></pre>\nAnd I prefer the concept of ""clarity"" to ""beauty"" when it comes to code. Beauty is, well, whatever in the eyes of the beholder. Clarity, for me, is the question of how fast code can be read and understood correctly by a given programmer who is familiar (not more) with the language, not necessarily familiar with other languages, and unfamiliar with what the code does.<p>The faster such a person can skim the code and understand it correctly, the easier it will be to modify and keep free of bugs.

Yes, it's stupid that you have to do this, and it would be awesome if everybody just had perfect information about who all the good employees are and which would be the perfect fit for your organization.  But people don't, not even at good companies.  And in the absence of that, it behooves you to do things that will shift people's perception of you in your favor, so that you have options and aren't prevented from doing what you really want to do.",1337469007

I'm simply trying to provide an explanation for why that may be.<p>I suppose people downvote because they dislike my explanations.  I think it is reasonable to think that many motorists don't feel that cyclists belong on the same road space.  As a cyclist, I wouldn't feel that I belong on the same road space as cars.

The reason they use this non-standard 30 pin connector rather than a standard USB connector is because their connector /does a lot more/.<p>Looking at a pin-out table, it seems it also does (or can do) video (composite / s-video), audio, and has pin(s) for adapters.<p>USB doesn't do that.

Hard to discuss too, because as always with women-related issues the heat is pretty high.<p>However, let's play devil's advocate and extend it to the man's case too. If I put myself in the role of a VC I would think twice about hiring anybody who's going to have children soon. Children, from what I gathered, are emotionally and physically draining for both parents. If you add up the challenges of having a startup, which is like another child well that's a good damn reason to refuse investing.<p>The problem is that pregnancy and a child coming soon can be physically seen on a woman, but we can't ask a VC to be blind on that.",1337468692

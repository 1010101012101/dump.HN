People find it comical now that we&#x27;re doing things now in HTML5 that we could do 10 years ago in flash or java, without remembering you could do it 20 or 30 years ago on the metal. Progress is sometimes making these things more broadly accessible, instead of just more &quot;impressive&quot; or &quot;serious&quot; from a technical standpoint. And that&#x27;s still an important and valuable kind of progress that should not be so easily discounted! Yeah html5 is not as impressive now as flash is now, but it&#x27;s open, free, and it could do the things flash could do when it started to get taken seriously. we can see the course of history from this point forward because we&#x27;ve been here before.

Massy complex mechanical circuits with all the imperfections that entails. Despite this, it&#x27;s very possible to improve the state of the art.<p>Sound production on the other hand is whatever the producer wants it to be.

So I&#x27;m not entirly sure this is as big a deal as being made out.  After all a SIM costs nothing, yet the phone that is locked to a network, now that is another issue.  More important to have the ability to purchase a unlocked phone than a unlocked SIM that you can just swap out.

Low quality digital samples of the music sounded terrible, and the alternatives like FM-Synth (ad-lib) weren&#x27;t good enough and MP3s were still too computationally intensive to decode while rendering a game.<p>It turns out that this type of music technology, first invented to work in the low memory environment of the original Amiga, and then advanced considerably since then, offered a great alternative. Digital samples of individual instruments were played back at different rates to simulate different notes and the note data itself was incredibly small.<p>While almost all Amiga (and a large number of Atari ST games) used a 4-channel version of this technique, notable games that used this kind of technology in the PC era include the original Unreal, Jazz Jackrabbit, Hitman, Deus Ex, Pinball Dreams, etc.<p>I can&#x27;t say if Impulse Tracker was used in the production of all of these. There were custom trackers, and other popular tracking software at the time, but the basic technique was very popular during this time. It&#x27;s likely that Impulse Tracker was less used than people think though as for a long time accurate playback of some of the advanced effects (filters, NNAs) outside of Impulse Tracker was pretty rare.<p>Quite a few video game music designers got their start writing music in this kind of environment because it was incredibly cheap to get up and running and producing music. e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Brandon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Brandon</a><p>Back then most trackers were free, or like Impulse Tracker, basically free except for 1 or 2 major features and you could simply rip the samples out of other songs to reuse in your own music. Since you could also &quot;read&quot; other people&#x27;s music files, you could also learn a lot about how to construct music. Different techniques, music theory, rhythm and percussion, etc. It&#x27;s kind of like open source music in a sense.<p>see more at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker</a>",1395543782

First of all, there is no upscale version of North Korea by definition since communism can never produce a high standard of living. Singapore's economy went from the third world to the first world in a single generation while North Korea has languished in squalor.<p>In Singapore, we see a country that is very well run.

The concept of incubators as a sort of real world B school makes a lot of sense to me, sure it works for many people. For those who choose to follow their own path, the following advice served me well.<p>* Position yourself as an expert on X, where X is a skill/trade/industry that is hot but not overcrowded (and where you can stand out, even if you're not the smartest person in the room)<p>* Get consulting gigs, which should be pretty profitable if you avoid tournament type situations with too many people chasing work (see above)<p>* Work on a couple side/hobby projects that could turn into a business, experiment with them, and watch results<p>* When something starts to roll, scale back on consulting biz<p>* Archive every contact you have, always be networking by sharing ideas with people (versus networking by hard selling).<p>Odds are any one of your ideas sucks. Eventually one of your ideas will click with users, and you'll be in a good position to build on it.

And you could have read that yourself.-</i><p>Er, so?<p>> <i>One could argue quite successfully that one of the chief reasons Java (applets) in a browser is a bad design is because of its ""standardised"" bytecode format, which is what everyone in this discussion thread is screaming for.</i><p>Then please, reasonably argue it. I don't understand how the argument applies.<p>Java applets perform poorly in the browser for a number of reasons, none of which have anything to do with bytecode:<p>- Java's generational GC is designed around reserving a very large chunk of RAM, and performs poorly if insufficient RAM is reserved. This is a terrible idea for desktop software.<p>- Java's sandboxing model is broken and insecure, as it exposes an enormous amount of code as an attack surface. A bug in just about any piece of code in the trusted base libraries can result in a total sandbox compromise.<p>- Java is slow to start and slow to warm up, and applets more so. It historically ran single-threaded in the browser and blocked execution as it did start up.<p>- Swing does look native, and doesn't look like the web page, either. Applets can't actually interface with the remainder of the DOM in any integrated fashion (eg, you can't have a Java applet provide a DOM element or directly interface with JS/DOM except through bridging), so applets are odd-men-out for both the platform, and the website they're on.<p>> <i>Flash was able to get by better by virtue of having a monopoly instead of a standard, and thus, has the freedom to change its swf format and bytecode format.</i><p>That doesn't even make sense. Flash was better because it didn't lock up your browser when an applet started, and didn't consume huge amounts of RAM due to a GC architecture that was poorly suited to running on user desktops.<p>Flash sucked because of its extremely poor implementation and runtime library design.",1361047161

There is always a newly-hyped library or framework or methodology that's trying to shift people's attention; and rather than refining and evolving the existing stuff into stability and maturity, many devs start new, wobbly, immature projects. But the bleeding edge is fickle, and when the dust settles there are some remaining competitors, but then suddenly the dust rises again and you're urged to abandon everything because the new stuff is in a separate programming language, so everything else is now incompatible; so the cycle goes.

The only reason it hasn't gone away is that we haven't made it go away. If the likes of the BBC and technology companies would collectively say ""sorry, DRM is poison, we're not having any part of it"" then it would already be gone. Sympathizing with or defending their refusal to do so only makes them less likely to do it, and makes the day when DRM only exists in the history books take that much longer to arrive.<p>>When you protest HTML5 gaining a standard way to specify this, you're saying I would prefer most of the internet run on close binary plugins controlled by a single vendor until the rest of the world adopts my political views.<p>How do you imagine any DRM could possibly work that isn't based on ""closed binary plugins controlled by a single vendor""? Perhaps ""closed binary plugins controlled by a cartel of large colluding vendors""? How is that better?<p>You can't actually publish how the DRM works in the standard or it isn't DRM anymore. You can't allow competitors to produce their own independent implementations or ""competitors"" from Russia will produce implementations that allow copying. Open standard DRM is an oxymoron. What they're talking about is adding to the standard a flag that says ""use this proprietary DRM solution"" -- in other words, promoting more binary blob nonsense, instead of encouraging content distributors to just be rational and abandon the whole idea.<p>>Finally, it's a canard to make this an open source issue: it's really about control of the underlying platform: if the decryption key is extractable, it's game-over  and so the studios desperately want to end general purpose computing. Neither Windows nor WinDVD were OSS and yet the first DVD key extraction happened there shortly after release.<p>How is it a canard? It isn't a matter of which platforms are secure, it's a matter of which platforms are legal. No DRM is secure. But open source exposes the facade of DRM security so comprehensively that no such implementations are allowed to be licensed. Or, if you're being more cynical, the point of DRM is to claim that against open source implementations in order to justify prohibiting them, so that they can prohibit free and open competitors to the Hollywood-sanctioned wall gardens that allow major content distributors to collect unjustified rents from smaller content providers and control the public discourse.",1361045761

The intro diaog should step you through the process<p>- It even supports interactive rebasing! Try it out with ""git rebase -i HEAD~3""<p>Git is a fairly complex too that can be explained really well graphically. I never understood what I was doing until I saw diagrams in the git manpages and various books around on the internet. I wanted there to be an interactive form of these diagrams but it didn't exist --- so I built it.<p>9,000 lines of JS later I have this. There's still some polishing to be done, but I'd love for the community to share their knowledge about different git workflows and different ways to explain git concepts.<p>I tried to make the bar for contributing as low as possible.

There are two things you are describing here:<p>1) It was a pain to name all of these anonymous blocks.<p>2) The idea of naming the blocks is annoying / aesthetically displeasing to you.<p>#1 is just part of porting something between different languages.

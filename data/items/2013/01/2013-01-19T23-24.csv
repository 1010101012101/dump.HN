If law enforcement knew of drug activity, why weren't <i>they</i> able to stop it? The owners of the motel have much less legal recourse than the police do.<p>More generally, a ""service provider"" (taken loosely) has no obligation to act as law enforcement of its service.

5085347,comment,5084401,5084560,5,0,betterunix,,,"""Little to no commercial value?""<p>This is one thing is was absolutely correct:  those articles had almost no chance of being sold at <i>$20 a piece</i>.  In fact, the commercial value has little to do with the articles themselves, since JSTOR and journal publishers make the bulk of their money from <i>subscriptions</i>, which libraries will pay for regardless of the availability of articles by other means, and by offering search services, which Aaron was not preparing to offer.  The claim that Aaron's plan would have caused any measurable harm to JSTOR or any of the publishers it contracts is dubious.<p>It is also worth noting that the government is not supposed to be in the business of indiscriminately protecting commercial interests.  Even if we assume that sharing these articles via BitTorrent would have damaged JSTOR's business, so what?  The purpose of academic publishers in our society is to <i>make knowledge available on a widespread basis</i>, and if BitTorrent does a better job <i>we should have switched to BitTorrent long ago</i>.  Academic publishers are not like the RIAA or MPAA; where the music and movie businesses can claim that their profits pay for the entertainment they release, journal publishers cannot make such a claim, <i>because the research they publish is paid for by someone else, the peer review process is voluntary, and many journals even have volunteer editors</i>.<p>I agree that the characterization of Aaron's behavior as a ""college prank"" is unrealistic; a better characterization would have been ""heroic.""",1358639856

Non-technical founders who can offer equity only.<p>5. Non-technical founders who can offer equity and money.<p>6. Non-technical founders who can offer money only.<p>In either type of founder, the best option for a developer is equity+money, if they can afford a full-time commitment.<p>If the founder can only offer equity, this raises the stakes significantly and is a problem.

5085307,comment,5084397,5084397,6,0,mindcrime,,,"Cold emailing people and asking about their pain points is probably not the best way to go.  That said, you're on (sort of) the right path by understanding that you need to find potential customers and talk to them early on, so that's a good step.<p>What I'd recommend is this:<p>1. Network, in person, as much as possible, and make real-world connections with people.  If you're not a natural schmoozer, don't sweat it, it can be learned.  Just go to events and talk to people.  In the earliest phases, if you're just trying to get comfortable doing that sort of thing, don't worry too much about what kind of event, or what the person's title is, etc.  Go to Java User's Group meetings, go to Entrepreneurship Meetups you find on Meetup.com, go to local Chamber of Commerce schmoozefests, etc, etc.  If you live in or near any reasonably sized city, there should be an event calendar somewhere online that lists upcoming networking events.  Seek them out and go and talk to people.<p>2. Leverage your <i>existing</i> network of real world connections, as well as any new connections you make, to make warm introductions for you, to other people you want to meet.<p>3. If you DO cold email people, don't just ask them to write up a thesis on their pain points for you, and send it to you.  You'd probably get more traction saying something roughly like ""I'm looking at creating a product targeted towards (your industry | people in your position | whatever) and would love to pick your brain for a little while.  Could I grab 30 minutes of your time in exchange for lunch (or a coffee / beverage of your choice)?  I can also share some really interesting research with you, that we've done in regards to $FOO.""<p>Note that that last bit is optional, but it is always good if you can offer the other person something for their time.  There <i>are</i> people out there who will sit and talk to you, either out of pure altruism, a desire to ""give back"", or because it strokes their ego to think that you consider them important, or a myriad of other reasons.  But <i>quid pro quo</i> is a pretty powerful mindset and having something to offer is usually good.<p>Also, I think it would be good if you had at least a vague idea of an area you want/expect to work in, and could develop some decent domain knowledge of that area.  This goes to credibility, and will be important in getting other people to risk their reputation on you, which is what they are doing when they make introductions to their connections, on your behalf.  You need to impress people as ""someone who knows his shit and is worth spending time with"" for best effect.<p>I recommend reading Steve Blank's book <i>The Four Steps To The Epiphany</i> as there's a good section in there about what he calls ""Friendly First Contacts"" which would be relevant to you.  There are also a lot of old threads on the Lean Startup Circle mailing list about how to get introductions, meet customers, interview people, etc.  Dig through those archives and you'll find some golden stuff.<p>Edit: one last thing... there is something to be said for persistence, and there are some gimmicks you can use to get a better response rate on cold emails / letters.  I'm not necessarily an advocate for either badgering people or engaging in a lot of gimmicks, but don't be afraid to send more than one email, and - if you feel the urge - send a handwritten letter and send it via Priority Mail or Fedex or whatever. Or send a stupid little trinket (a plastic bottle opener keyring thing or something) along with your letter.

Some of those hospitals are for people who pose no risk to others and who have never been involved in offending behaviour.  Other hospitals are forensic, are part of the criminal justice system, and take people who are mentally disordered offenders.  You have different levels or different wards - wards for people who pose a serious risk of harm to others; wards for people who pose little risk of harm to others but who are really ill and who would otherwise be in jail.<p>In the UK prisoners have a sentence.  They serve the sentence, and then are released.  A prisoner who develops a severe mental health problem is transferred to a secure[1] mental health unit (a forensic unit).  They stop being a prisoner and become a patient.  They get returned to jail when they are well.  Some criminals are ill at the time of the offending behaviour, and get sent straight to secure hospitals.  These people do not have a sentence.  They just have to convince people that they're well.  And once they've done that they get returned to jail to continue serving their sentence.  So being a patient means things like forced medication, and a lack of information about when you're going to be released or what you need to do to get out.<p>I take your point though.  I hope I haven't suggested that people can use mental ill health as an excuse for offending behaviour.<p>[1] Secure is a jargon word here, meaning units for people with some police involvement.  There are plenty of locked wards, but they don't get called secure units.

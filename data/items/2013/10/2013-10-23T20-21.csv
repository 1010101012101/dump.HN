Now that we can no longer kill these bugs <i>after</i> they invade the body, hospitals have significantly ramped up their efforts to kill them <i>before</i> they invade.<p>Hurray for these protocols, but that won&#x27;t do all that we need. It won&#x27;t be possible to scrub the whole world with poisons the way we have begun scrubbing hospital rooms. We need ways to stop infections that we can&#x27;t prevent.",1382561996

(Under a certain dollar amount you just have to put in the current month to get an authorization). Apparently they haven&#x27;t found that practice to be a problem with consumers (although I&#x27;m sure they do get complaints.)",1382561990

6601624,comment,6600643,6601316,1,0,derekp7,,,"Actually, I&#x27;ve got a couple of things that flaked out on me in the last year or so.  This was with Fedora 17, on a Lenovo Thinkpad x230 laptop, and Intel video.  At first I put Ubuntu on it, but it wouldn&#x27;t reliably survive suspend/resume, and sometimes X11 would lock up (this is because the chipset used in this laptop was band new at the time, and driver support was still a bit flaky).  So I put Fedora 17 on it, and got a bit better luck.<p>However, after a few automatic updates, I started to get really weird sound issues.  When playing videos with VLC, I would get a buzzing sound (like a broken speaker) for the first minute or so, then it would clear up -- this only happened sometimes, after a suspend / resume.  Reverting to an earlier kernel fixed it, but also I couldn&#x27;t duplicate the issue with any other audio program -- just VLC.  Eventually (after a couple months), the various libraries, software components, and kernel versions stabilized on this hardware, and now suspend/resume, audio, etc are all flawless.  But I know I&#x27;m probably in for some pain next time I upgrade hardware (unless I get last years model).<p>Second problem -- I picked up a generic 7.1 USB audio device.  The center channel and subwoofer are reversed.  I can&#x27;t figure out how to re-assign the audio channels through the driver (I think there is some combination of Alsa and Pulse config file tweaks, but haven&#x27;t got them to work yet).  Ideally I&#x27;d like to pass some parameters to the kernel module for the sound device to swap channels.  I looked at the source code, saw there was a spot where I can add the chipset in the &quot;quirks&quot; table, but couldn&#x27;t find the data structures that assign audio output to specific channels.  I&#x27;ll probably end up jumping on one of the kernel dev mailing lists to figure that part out when I get time.  Meanwhile, I just made an adapter to swap the channels (both the center speaker and sub-woofer come out of the same audio jack on the sound device).",1382561581

Hell, just re-syncing my whole email archive into another client would take days (Google throttles batch downloads aggressively, and I don&#x27;t always have internet connectivity when I need access to my email archive).

The Linux kernel developers actively try to break the binary drivers. This means that once the manufactures stop supporting the hardware, you have to worry about the drivers not working on the next kernel release. Case in point my Radeon X1950 can no longer run the catalyst drivers in Linux and I&#x27;m instead stuck with the buggy and slow Gallium3D drivers. In Windows 8, I can still load drivers written for Vista and run modern games like Star Craft 2 and Crysis 2.<p>If Valve can improve the driver situation, it will be a huge win for Linux gamers.

6601478,comment,6598596,6599784,6,0,beloch,,,"I don&#x27;t work in this field, but here&#x27;s an educated guess (or two).<p>Lasers are not perfectly coherent, parallel beams.  They&#x27;re close but, over the distance between the Earth and the moon, even the most powerful, carefully adjusted and perfectly focused laser will expand much like a flashlight beam.  Take the laser pointer you use for presentations and shine it across the room and you&#x27;ll see a substantially larger spot size than if you shine it on your hand.  You get the idea. Getting a strong signal means you need a lot of area in your receiver.  A big dish will help at either end, but it&#x27;s harder to send a big dish to the moon.<p>Another huge factor is going to be atmospheric distortion.  The atmosphere is full of eddies and currents of air at different temperatures and relative motions. Light going through it gets refracted somewhat chaotically.  If you try to lock a free-space laser signal in over a distance of even just a few tens of kilometers through air, it&#x27;s actually a bit of a challenge because that (rather large) spot will jump all over the place.  Light traveling from the Earth to the moon goes through atmosphere at the source and gets bent and, by the time it reaches the moon, will be all over the place.  Light traveling the other way travels through vacuum until it&#x27;s very close to its destination. Consider trying to shine a laser pointer up out of a pool of choppy water and hit a distant target vs trying to hit a specific spot in the pool from that target. It&#x27;s a lot easier if the random bending happens nearer to the destination! There are a lot of things you can do to overcome this, but they probably all reduce the speed at which you can transmit.<p>Edit:  I just read this: <a href=""http://www.spaceflight101.com/ladee-lunar-laser-communication-demonstration.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spaceflight101.com/ladee-lunar-laser-communicatio...</a><p>The sending and receiving modes are completely different.  The moon craft sends polarization encoded data using a continuous beam.  This is received on the ground by highly sensitive single-photon-detectors hooked up to multiple large scopes. Sensitive, but bulky and components have to be cryo-cooled.  However, this allows for the use of a relatively weak laser at the moon and polarization modulation means you can probably get pretty good bandwidth, provided the atmosphere isn&#x27;t so turbulent that it requires you to check your states too often. (Polarization will be randomly transformed by the atmosphere, so you&#x27;d determine which polarization is which periodically as a part of communications.  This is presumably why they have multiple receivers that are probably measuring in different bases so each bit from the moon can be tomographically reconstructed.)<p>The ground-station sends pulse-position modulated (aka time-bin) encoded data with a fairly powerful laser. Say you wanted to signal a friend yes or no without talking.  You could synchronize a pair of stop-watches and, at an agreed time, you throw a ping-pong ball at his head.  If you want to say yes, you throw it right on time.  If you wan to say no, you throw it a bit late.  Obviously, your ability to distinguish early from late limits how fast you can send data this way.  If it was a windy day with random gusts, the ping-pong ball would arrive a bit randomly, so you&#x27;d need to make the delay required to declare a ball &quot;late&quot; somewhat longer.  Atmospheric distortion probably limits bandwidth to the moon for this reason.<p>Both polarization and time-bin encoding can be made to work both ways I suspect, but there might be reasons to choose one over the other for sending vs receiving. It does seem like the receiving station for a polarization encoded signal might be more bulky due to requiring multiple detectors operating on different polarization bases.  I&#x27;d love to ask the folks at NASA about this!  It might also be they just wanted to test both methods, since this really is an experiment more than anything.",1382560444

In the case of games, nearly every single game company refuses to provide their games as free (libre) game software. In the case of GPU drivers, the two big players still refuse to provide free drivers. There are plenty in the free software community willing to contribute to graphics drivers and to porting games to GNU/Linux, but these companies won&#x27;t let them because it conflicts with their goals of exerting strict control over their own users. I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that this situation will let up any time soon because it seems that people have fallen for their PR tricks and so don&#x27;t seem to mind whether or not most drivers and game software are proprietary.

Effectively, the government is saying to the state legislatures &quot;you can have marijuana dispensaries, but they better be tightly regulated.&quot;<p>So it&#x27;s in the best interest of both state and federal governments that the dispensaries follow the regulations set forth by the state governments. A company helping dispensaries follow those regulations will therefore also be in the best interest of everyone.<p>If your company has dispensary clients in multiple states with separate regulations, and you maintain software for each state&#x27;s regulations, then you will be in an excellent position when the federal government makes its first official pro-marijuana statement.",1382559982

Invasive MRSA infections that began in hospitals declined 54% between 2005 and 2011, with 30,800 fewer severe MRS infections. In addition, the study showed 9,000 fewer deaths in hospital patients in 2005 versus 2011.&quot;[1] So there are responses already in place that are gaining on antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospital settings in the United States.<p>I care about the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I am gravely concerned about the medical and public-health practices in India that have resulted in a massive increase in patients infected there with multiple-antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis.[2] I am 100 percent behind the idea that antibiotics have to be used cautiously and responsibly, and meanwhile we have to keep researching other means of infection control besides antibiotics.<p>You wrote,<p><i>We evolve through copying of other&#x27;s genes, simulation and symbiosis (yes, genes can simulate the effect other genes will have on them.</i><p>Do you really mean &quot;we&quot; there?

Even the &quot;good programmer&quot; exhibits a few common misconceptions about inheritance and virtual destructors.  Here&#x27;s the text from slide 348:<p>&quot;What is the point of having a virtual destructor on a class like this? There are no virtual functions so it does not make sense to inherit from it. I know that there are programmers who do inherit from non-virtual classes, but I suspect they have misunderstood a key concept of object orientation. I suggest you remove the virtual specifier from the destructor, it indicates that the class is designed to be used as a base class - while it obviously is not.&quot;<p>She&#x27;s right that the class described on the slide probably shouldn&#x27;t have a virtual destructor.<p><i>A base class should have a virtual destructor if and only if objects of its derived class are to be deleted through base class pointers.</i><p>The following four statements are wrong:<p>1. A class with other virtual functions should have a virtual destructor.<p>2. A class without other virtual functions should not have a virtual destructor.<p>3. A class designed to be a base class should have a virtual destructor.<p>4. You shouldn&#x27;t inherit from classes that don&#x27;t have virtual functions.<p>It&#x27;s a narrow-minded to say that programmers who inherit from &quot;non-virtual&quot; classes have &quot;misunderstood a key concept of object orientation.&quot;  Which key concept is that, by the way?  Object orientation isn&#x27;t the be all and end all of C++.  There are reasons to use inheritance that have nothing to do with run-time polymorphism.  Maybe you just want to reduce redundancy and organize your data types in terms of each other.<p>Another gripe is that on slide 369, she says:<p>&quot;When I see bald pointers in C++ it is usually a bad sign.&quot;<p>Naked pointers should usually be avoided for memory management.  That&#x27;s true.  But they make great iterators, and they&#x27;re useful, along with references, for passing objects to functions.<p>On the other hand, seeing the keywords &quot;new&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; in code is usually a bad sign.  Resources (not just memory) should be managed by resource management classes.  If you try to do it manually, especially in the presence of exceptions and concurrency, it&#x27;s very easy to cause an inadvertent resource leak.",1382559618

One of the great attributes of the gossip protocol is it is very robust to intermittent network failures. Under minimal packet loss conditions (<5%), the rate of false positives should be very low. This is due to a few techniques, one of which is indirect probing, and another is a novel &quot;suspicion&quot; mechanism. In the case of a network partition, the parts of the cluster can run in isolation and will recover when the partition heals. If you are interested, the paper referenced there (&quot;SWIM: Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group Membership Protocol&quot;), is the foundation of Serf. In the paper you can find more details about the behavior of the cluster, false positive rates under packet loss, and partition handling.<p>tl;dr the systems is in fact designed with network errors in mind, as opposed to handling them being an afterthought.",1382559283

We now have code-generating frameworks that help automate away much of the tedious, repetitive parts of implementing an application.<p>It&#x27;s not a good thing that software development is hard. It does mean that you&#x27;re a very smart and hard-working person if you&#x27;re able to do it effectively. But it&#x27;s not a good thing for society that you need to be so smart and hard-working in order to do it.<p>It is, however, a good thing that it&#x27;s not as hard as it used to be. The fact that a software developer has to do and know less today than they did 20-30 years ago, just to build an application and distribute it to a large number of users, is a sign of progress.",1382558851

in reliance on the exemption in any 12-month period. The only reference in the statute to 
changing that amount is the requirement that the Commission update the amount not less 
frequently than every five years based on the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, statements in 
the Congressional Record indicate that Congress believed that $1 million was a substantial 
amount for a small business. We do not believe that Congress intended for us to modify the 
maximum aggregate amount permitted to be sold under the exemption when promulgating rules 
to implement the statute. Therefore, we are not proposing to increase the limitation on the 
aggregate amount sold.",1382558782

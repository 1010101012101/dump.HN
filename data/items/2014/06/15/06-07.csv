7894626,comment,7894266,7894489,1,0,jrockway,,,"First, if you care about wireless speed, you&#x27;re not using 2.4GHz, you&#x27;re using 5GHz.  5GHz channels do not overlap.<p>Second, other WiFi networks are not really the cause of interference.  Certainly, if two networks are sharing the same channel and both have stations that want to use the full bandwidth at the same time, that won&#x27;t work.  But WiFi does listen before it transmits, and does not transmit when it can hear other stations transmitting.  This lets many networks share the same channel.<p>Where this goes wrong is when two stations want to talk to the same access point, but can&#x27;t hear each other.  (The &quot;hidden node&quot; problem.)  In that case, station A can&#x27;t tell that station B is transmitting, and so station A might transmit over station B&#x27;s transmission, resulting in garbage at the access point.  (Access points that can both hear a station but not each other can also do this, of course.)<p>In the scenario you mention, your own access point and Comcast&#x27;s access point are almost in the same place, so they should be able to hear the same set of stations.  If they pick the same channel (and autoselection _is_ notoriously poor), they should not interfere except to share bandwidth.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s so much crap in the 2.4GHz band already that another WiFi network isn&#x27;t going to make a difference.  From my apartment I can hear 20+ WiFi networks, and if I look at a spectrum readout, can see tons of other things that I have no idea what they are.  <a href=""https://plus.google.com/115192122236060613729/posts/RZHLmV5KPQH"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/115192122236060613729/posts/RZHLmV5K...</a>",1402815297

7894595,comment,7894360,7894556,3,0,austinz,,,"Absolutely. I can&#x27;t agree with this more.<p>A long time ago I worked on a codebase where (among other problems) developers who wanted to extend a particular feature needed to modify five or six different methods spread across a number of files. (This feature was basically a pipeline that took in JSON from our servers and translated it into views to display to the end user.) Forgetting to modify even one of these files would lead to code that compiled but would throw cryptic errors at runtime.<p>Developers from outside our team who wanted to work on the codebase and extend the feature would reliably lose several days to either the problem I described above, or hunting around the code trying to piece together how the feature worked from the disparate implementation details.<p>Eventually, I took some time off and refactored part of the feature so that only a single source of truth needed to be modified in order to extend it. As a bonus, this refactoring made the mapping between data models and views in our application explicit, making the behavior of the feature significantly easier to understand. I didn&#x27;t ask management or submit any sort of formal proposal; I did this on my own time because I had become fed up with the limitations of the existing approach.<p>After the refactor entered the codebase, the aforementioned bugs vanished, as did many of the questions from outside developers about what models corresponded to which views, or how the feature worked, or how to extend the feature in general.<p>I tell this intentionally vague (and honestly quite pedestrian) anecdote not to brag (the refactor was reasonably straightforward), but rather because I wanted to emphasize the difference between feature work and technical-debt-payoff work. The refactor almost certainly saved a considerable amount of developer effort and increased code reliability. But how much so is not something that can be easily measured (if at all), unlike the impact of a user-facing feature. Not only this, some combination of apathy and political pressure from external stakeholders tends to lead management to deprioritize paying off technical debt. Proposals to management to formally set aside time to address other issues of similar scope were pushed back repeatedly or dropped.<p>PMs and product people can A/B test, gather analytics, get concrete data on hypothesis A versus hypothesis B when it comes to features. But it&#x27;s rare that engineers get asked how much more quickly they could get their work done if they hadn&#x27;t had to hack around unmaintainable hacks, or how much more reliable their code would be if bad design didn&#x27;t muddy up the codebase or provide hiding spots for weird corner cases. Given how expensive software engineers are and how supposedly scarce they are, I&#x27;m honestly surprised that this isn&#x27;t something management thinks about more.",1402814118

I&#x27;m certainly not an expert, but I have a private theory that the very sweetness of artificial sweeteners influences insulin release via some mechanism. Whether by &quot;crying wolf&quot; and promoting insulin resistance, or by some other means, I suspect there&#x27;s some kind of message at play - &quot;lots of sugar coming, blood, get ready!&quot; - which then has a deleterious effect even when there&#x27;s no actual sugar involved.<p>Well, it&#x27;s not very scientific, but I&#x27;ve arrived at this theory by a couple of observations. One in myself - I used to be a huge diet coke junkie, up to 10 cans a day sometimes, and I found it impossible to lose weight, plus I noticed that I got that &quot;after sugar&quot; feeling somehow from the drink. When I cut it out, plus everything else artificially sweet (I was barely consuming any sugar), my weight loss issues disappeared and I just felt .. much better.<p>The other side of my anecdotal data comes from observing the same thing in friends. I know a few people who have gone pretty heavily low carb to lose weight, and I note a seeming correlation between success and cutting out sweet foods/drinks, no matter if they have sugar or not. OK, it&#x27;s not exactly a double blind large-scale test, but nonetheless.<p>I&#x27;m not the only one I know who thinks this either. A couple of the PTs at my gym have noticed the same thing, and advise their clients to cut everything sweet from their diet, fake sugar or not. And Tim Ferriss advises a maximum of one diet drink a day.<p>So yeah, if you ask me (or the people above) - stay away from diet soft drinks and anything else sweet. I can&#x27;t point to any large-scale studies, but over the years I&#x27;ve become pretty convinced there&#x27;s something there.",1402813348

We somehow managed to talk past each other and go out of sync and ended up responding to something that was not on the others mind.<p>If you thought I am not in agreement with this comment of yours, then let me assure you that I am (with certain differences).<p>My point remains that your Ariane example is irrelevant, it shows that statically typed systems can still fail if there are failure modes outside of the purview of the typechecker. That is obvious and was never in contest. What was in contest, however, was the <i>relative</i> safeties of statically typed vs dynamically typed. Your example has no bearing in clearing that question. I am claiming superiority of the static paradigm because no one has been forthcoming in putting their money and lives in control of a dynamically typed controller. You are just refusing to concede this because it affects your view in some way, and I dont expect to see any change in that behavior.<p>Let me put forward my main claim (and ignore the silly hypothetical ones): dynamically typed/checked languages are unsuitable and dangerous for cases where runtime errors are egregiously costly because they cannot prove that such eventualities cannot happen before they actually happen. Because of these risks involved such systems are sensibly not implemented in dynamically typed/checked languages. Statically typed languages cannot immunizes against all possible failures, yet they are better than dynamically typed languages in this scenario because they can eliminate a large class of these runtime errors that dynamically typed languages just cannot (if they can they are statically typed by definition), whereas testing applies equally to both.<p>BTW a dynamically typed language with exhaustive static analysis is a statically typechecked language.",1402812102

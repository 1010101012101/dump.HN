10437382,comment,10435984,10436593,0,0,cthalupa,,,">my city has a &quot;Girls Learning Code&quot; meetup / lecture series that while advertises being gender neutral is clearly not so<p>The majority of women drop out of the running for STEM jobs before they even go to college - something is persuading them at the primary school level to avoid tech related fields. It&#x27;s the biggest reason that the idea of sexism in the workplace pushing women out of IT is absurd - because they never got there in the first place. They never even got to the college classes in the first place. Even high school vocational programs focusing on tech have girls wildly unrepresented.<p>And it&#x27;s the exact same reason that organizations like Girls Who Code is extremely important. It&#x27;s the same reason that an organization like Boys Who Teach/Nurse/Other female dominated profession would be a godsend for evening out the gender balance in those fields.<p>Should there be code/stem programs for boys? Absolutely. Is there anything wrong with programs that exists primarily for outreach to a gender that is underrepresented in that field? Absolutely not.",1445587143
10437381,comment,10436792,10437298,0,0,e12e,,,"I think it&#x27;s more of an issue with &quot;marketing&quot; or how IPFS is (was?) presented: It&#x27;s not a magic web-in-the-sky for all the things -- but it does make it <i>really</i> easy to a) host stuff redundantly, and b) scale out distribution. So you could edit a static web page on your laptop, have a &quot;post commit hook&quot; (or other automagic system) that pulls/pushes published posts to two-three permanent servers -- these could be backed up as normal, or you could just spin up some VMs and have them &quot;restore&quot; from some &quot;master list&quot; of your own content (hashes).<p>Now as long as at least one device is up (and has the content), you can bring backups on-line easily. And as long as at least one server is connected to IPFS other nodes can get the content, and in theory, any spike in popularity will get distributed and cached &quot;suitably&quot;.<p>An added bonus is that if you publish something like a controversial, but popular, political blog post/expose, and some government throw you in a hole that officially doesn&#x27;t exist -- your readers, if they&#x27;re on IPFS, will maintain an active backup of your content by virtue of reading it.<p>This is a lot more convenient than someone having to explicitly spider it etc (although a combination would probably work/be good idea -- eg: an IPFS &quot;dmoz.org&quot; where authors could register content index-pointers for others to spider/download into their IPFS nodes --  and index for search).",1445587100

It&#x27;s how I got it answered for me a long time ago.<p>> How can I tell if I have programming aptitude?<p>I have a friend who&#x27;s a painter. She&#x27;s a visual artist with a fair deal of success; she can actually live out of her art (and by that I mean she actually sells her paintings for a living, she doesn&#x27;t just design logos to buy her a little time for her <i>real</i> occupation on Friday evenings).<p>We were gathered at her house for a gig and waiting for the guitarist to show up (as usual), and while we were each rehearsing various bits and pieces, she sat on an armchair across from me and casually picked up a piece she had almost finished, and began applying some finishing touches. I&#x27;d never seen her painting before, so after I picked up my jaw from the floor, I passingly remarked that I&#x27;m a little envious on anyone who has a talent for drawing.<p>(Background: my depth perception is basically shit because of a limp eye. The only reasonable drawings I ever made where in Geometry classes).<p>Her reply was along the lines of dude, look, the ones who have a <i>talent</i> for this are the likes of Picasso and el Greco. Everyone else, even those of us who paint a lot better than anyone else you can find on the street, just practiced a lot.<p>She then proceeded to show me a couple of things she had drawn when she was a kid, long before she decided she wanted to do that for a living. Surely enough, they looked much like any other kid&#x27;s drawings. They were a little less &quot;hurried&quot;, as she obviously loved doing it and spent more time on a drawing, but were otherwise indistinguishable from other childrens&#x27; drawings. Even later ones, from around the time when she had decided she <i>really</i> liked this, weren&#x27;t exactly breathtaking.<p>tl;dr: You have the &quot;programmer aptitude&quot; if:<p>a) You&#x27;re a frickin&#x27; genius who can talk to computers as if they were kindred spirits, but then I guess you wouldn&#x27;t be asking this if you were, or\nb) You like programming enough that you can do a lot of it, and can tolerate spending that time looking at your programs with a critical eye and seeing where you failed and what you can improve.<p>The pitfall in b) is that it will consistently make you feel like a failure, but hey, that&#x27;s life man.",1445586401

Old links will still break, because old links are generally less popular. Old websites will simply vanish, even ones that are otherwise maintained on the current web.<p>In particular, applications like this post itself, that are part backup part publishing, aren&#x27;t great applications of IPFS because your images are just hosted off your home internet connection. Power outage? No data. ISP issue? No data. Hardware failure? Hope you had a real backup. Basically, why would I choose IPFS, which is in this case equivalent to self hosting, over flickr, instagram, etc?<p>Edit: I&#x27;d be remiss to not refer you to toomuchtodo&#x27;s comment below. Were a service like the Internet Archive to take part in IPFS then it would help with some of my above concerns.

I think they&#x27;re called global fashion group or something now): branded stuff has a 50% gross margin and the private label stuff up to 90%. That kind of economics leaves room for a lot of error and learning - basically, if you can get your costs under control, manage your inventory correctly and so on, you have a new Zara or H&M. So long as you can see this trend towards improvement, it&#x27;s worth investing in (and will probably IPO eventually).<p>I used to think Rocket was operationally not that great, but then I started consulting with normal medium sized businesses and by comparison, they are regional leaders (dunno about global, as I haven&#x27;t had any American clients yet, but based on my interviews with large Californian companies I won&#x27;t name who still have interns do all their reporting in Excel, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Rocket was ahead there too). Same applies to marketing - the ones I worked in were surprisingly efficient with up to 10x the conversion rate I witnessed in competitors and a CPO perhaps 1/5th as high.<p>Could they do better than they are doing? Absolutely, but generalizing from FoodPanda (&quot;pretty typical&quot;) or the Samwer &quot;Blitzkrieg email&quot; is like saying Uber and Palantir will end like Pets.com because they&#x27;re Californian tech startups with VC funding pre-profit.

Option A burns political capital to enforce, option B externalises the costs to consumers.<p>I think the real solution is to address the root of the problem, which is that people (in aggregate) are not making informed decisions. We need to reduce the time/effort required to evaluate the options. It seems like the information age is already moving us in the right direction -- internet searching with your smartphone is quite easy and you can do it on the spot. But we&#x27;re also moving backwards due to the excessive number of choices; searching >=20 toothpastes is still too daunting, and there is the issue of artificial reviews posted by toothpaste sellers.<p>Additional regulation could be the answer if it helps customers compare products. We have nutritional information panels on food products, they are always the same format and are easy to compare. Medicinal products have the active ingredients and concentrations listed so you can compare.<p>An option is to verify the product claims and include those in a standard format like the nutritional panel.

5428816,comment,5427963,5428459,7,0,rz2k,,,"A good deal of useful thinking involves models, and I don't particularly understand the anger that results.<p>Google isn't a monopolist in this situation either, but it is useful to understand pricing dynamics where there is no competitor. It sheds light on price discrimination with coupons, for example.<p>Krugman mischaracterizes the article[1], since it does not claim that Reader was crucial infrastructure, but he doesn't argue that it is crucial infrastructure himself either. They both talk about the dynamics of a product that has network effects and becomes a public good.<p>We generally know from cognitive sciences how we economize in situations like having a reliably knowledgeable colleague. This has served as a counterpoint to the silly arguments about how Google is making us stupid, but nevertheless says that the specialization in our expertise that it facilitates has Google search's continued availability as a vital component.<p>The original article talks about whether discontinuations will cause users to be more cautious about adopting services that create dependencies, and whether it will inhibit the success of new ones that involve network effects.<p>>Google wants us to use its services in ways that provide it with interesting and valuable information, and eyeballs. If a particular Google experiment isn't cutting it in that category, then Google may feel justified in axing it.<p>>But that makes it increasingly difficult for Google to have success with new services. Why commit to using and coming to rely on something new if it might be yanked away at some future date? This is especially problematic for ""social"" apps that rely on network effects. Even a crummy social service may thrive if it obtains a critical mass.<p>Anyway, the important issues aren't perfectly typified by Reader, but it is a situation people are familiar with at this moment. Personally, I think it is worth thinking about why more of the shuttered projects haven't been sold off or at least open sourced like Wave. Combine that with profitable businesses that are acquired for the talent, then neglected to death, and it sounds like a lot of effort is being needlessly trashed.<p>It is not difficult to imagine that if books.google.com were able to give even more liberal access to its library, that struggling municipalities would be even less willing to fund their libraries. This hypothetical would be unambiguously good for the world if it lead to more access to information, but one can also imagine that this hypothetical could also lead to a dependency that was itself vulnerable.<p>There are a lot of things that won't lead to the end of civilization, but they can still be nevertheless worse than an alternate outcome.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/03/utilities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/03/utilitie...</a>",1364057914

I've taken several courses where there was an optional pair programming portion, and after trying it a few times, I swore it off for good. I hated pair programming because every person I worked with just sat there (without interest). Which is just stupid.<p>But recently, I did some pair programming with folks closer to my skill level, and it was much better. I wouldn't swear by it or anything, but we were both working through a really hard problem, and it was helpful to write code together. It was slower, but I felt like I absorbed the problem quicker.<p>Also, one tip: plug in an extra keyboard. The driver is still the driver, but if the other chimes up and thinks of a better way to write a particular piece of code, it's easier to just let them instead of having them explain it to the driver or having to switch the keyboard over or something.",1364057685

5428802,comment,5427840,5427840,6,0,droithomme,,,"Article has huge spin on it, claiming ""This is not a good sign for online education"".<p>Phrasing of question is do they ""deserve formal credit from your home institution."" No of course not, the class is free and they are not enrolled in the school. If the free class gets full credit, the university falls apart.<p>Also, giving real credit means you have to have money coming in, proctoring on site in their country for the tests, and id card checks. This will massively increase costs and completely eliminate the ability of people in most parts of the world from being able to take the class. One of the reasons for these classes is to open up western college style education to people throughout the world. Switching it to a pay model that validates identity just converts the whole thing into online extension courses, which they have already, and those certainly have never been MOOCs, enrollment numbers have been modest not in the 20,000-200,000 enrollment range per session (yes, with 10% passing but that means little, they still have huge numbers passing).",1364057588

No external RSS service necessary.<p>That said, I understand that sometimes externally controlled and centralized services can provide features and convenience at the expense of user control and privacy.<p>I care enough about my privacy, and aware enough of the alternatives to choose to tend to choose privacy over features and convenience (when I'm faced with such a choice).<p>I know a lot of users don't care about their privacy, don't realize how loss of privacy could impact them, or don't know that there are alternatives.  So they often choose to use ""free"" web services that give them some features or convenience (or just because all their friends use it, etc.).<p>This is unfortunate, but hopefully as more people become computer literate, the media exposes more cases of privacy violations, and more people become victims of identity theft, internet stalking, harrassment, and discrimination based on their computer and internet use habits, they'll start to wisen up and care more about privacy.<p>I only hope that by then it won't be too late.",1364057586

People rely on car companies and grocery stores to get home and feed their children, but economists aren't fighting to make those public. And federal parks are hardly critical infrastructure but I don't know many people who complain that they are public.<p>The article is written from a purely theoretical economic perspective, it's not a real proposal, so it's worth addressing it from that perspective. Krugman's argument is basically that there are certain products that add global value but cannot exist without people being forced to pay for it. Many economists - not all - agree this is a good criteria of what should be made public (infrastructure and research would fall in this category). It's hard to imagine that web services could fall under this, but I suspect a lot of people forget that the internet is still in its infancy and companies like google have been able to subsidize loss-creators through <i>insanely</i> high profits. That won't last, google is already scaling back, and the result may be a global destruction in value.<p>(To be clear I don't want to see things like google reader made public for idealogical reasons, and I think you and most people are the same way, but I think that's out of the scope of addressing Krugman's point)",1364056943

That part of the show is going to end up as a proxy for all kinds of mental disabilities, making it sound like these things not only don't exist, but when they exist, they don't matter.<p>I know some people on disability who have mental issues.  Some had developmental problems, and some had strokes, and some have mental illness, and there are other situations in between.  They aren't employable, at least not easily and full time.  The reason is that as the economy has shifted to a service economy, the service jobs, which used to be considered ""kick back"" or basically low stress, have become high stress.  When the profits of the business depend on the service workers, the stress falls on the service workers.<p>That stress is either around increasing production of mentally produced product (I'm sure programmers here know this), or of producing a positive psychological experience for someone else.  For example, the people working in retail have to be nice.  They can't be grouchy and talk shit to each other like people used to when they worked in factories.<p>Maybe Joffe-Walt hasn't really thought about this, but within the class of sit-down jobs, the ones she has are not the common kind.  There's variety in the work, and a huge need to ""think outside the box"".  Even the stressors have some variety to them.<p>Most service jobs are about forcing your mind into the box, and handling the same stressors over and over.

In the 1930s, we connected Americans to an electric grid that improved agriculture and brought industry to the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and the Great Plains of Nebraska. In the 1950s, we connected Americans to an interstate highway system that fueled jobs on the line in Detroit and in the warehouse in L.A.<p>Infrastructure networks unite us as a country, bringing together parents and children, buyers and sellers, and citizens and government in ways once unimaginable. Ubiquitous access to infrastructure networks has continually driven American innovation, progress, prosperity and global leadership.<p>In communications, the government stimulated the construction of radio and television facilities across the country by offering huge tracts of the publics airwaves free of charge. It did the same with telephony through a Universal Service Fund, fulfilling the vision of the Communications Act of 1934 'to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.'\n...\nToday, high-speed Internet is transforming the landscape of America more rapidly and more pervasively than earlier infrastructure networks. Like railroads and highways, broadband accelerates the velocity of commerce, reducing the costs of distance. Like electricity, it creates a platform for Americas creativity to lead in developing better ways to solve old problems. Like telephony and broadcasting, it expands our ability to communicate, inform and entertain.<p>Broadband is the great infrastructure challenge of the early 21st century.</i>",1364055636

Their Google Apps, App Engine and related services are also very much commercial and face stiff competition. Hell, even search is highly contested, though Google has been able to stay ahead of this one.<p>Google Reader had a massive user base when compared to other RSS readers, but it's hardly a monopoly. I'd understand the uproar if it was the ONLY RSS reader to ever exist, and ever to be possible. There are alternatives. The very definition of monopoly is that you do not have a choice.

A method according to claim 2 further comprising the steps of: transmitting said coded information to a decoder for decoding.<p>4. A method according to claim 2 further comprising the steps of: storing said coded information in a storage means.<p>42. A video encoder according to claim 41, further comprising: means for transmitting said encoded information for the segment to a decoder for decoding.<p>If claims 2 and 41 (base claims for 3, 4, and 42) are too weak to apply in a particular case, or are unpatentable (which should be the case since they are math claims), they cannot possibly be made stronger simply by handwaving in some mentions of storage and of transferring data.  Yet that is how all of these algorithm/math patents hope to survive.  Reference a computer, referencing storing something, reference transmitting something, and suddenly something that's not patentable becomes patentable.<p>This patent racket depends on the idea that it's so uncommon to think to use a computer to perform some calculation, or implement an algorithm in a chip, or use disks or memory to store data, or use a data bus or ethernet/infiniband/rapidio to transmit anything, that adding those things (usually not even mentioning a specific type of computer, or storage, or transmission mechanism) vaults the idea into uniqueness.<p>Supposing 3, 4, and 42 somehow survived, because they might in the strictest sense be considered to involved material things, they amount to retrieving data (from an unspecified data source), performing transformations (math) to them (using unspecified hardware), and possibly storing or transmitting the results (again, hardware unspecified).<p>Software patents are simply a scam.

She overheard something that she found objectionable, then she demanded unequal treatment based on her status as a woman. A clear case of gender discrimination, and she is the guilty party.",1364054426

However, photons do not have rest mass. The formula for photons is E = pc, where p is the momentum of the photon. The full form is E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2, where m is the rest mass and p is the momentum. Taking p = 0 for an object at rest gives E = mc^2, taking m = 0 for a photon gives E = pc.",1290639534

So in the rest frame of a photon, the photon has no energy, and thus has no mass (or at least that's the theory, in principle more difficult to test and for all intents and purposes it is very nearly zero and most probably is exactly zero). In our rest frame, the photon moves at the speed of light, so...\nE = mc^2 + kintetic energy + potential energy -> which basically reduces to E = hf (plank's constant * frequency of the light).",1290639440

I'm paying for lovefilm (cds posted to home). I'm paying for ebooks and a game once in a while. It's really easy to get money from me, as long as someone makes it easy for me to pay.<p>I'm still not paying for tv shows simply because there's no good way to do that (or I haven't heard about it yet). I don't watch them on tv, because I don't want ads and I don't own/need a tv in general.

1938758,comment,1938345,1938507,0,0,harshpotatoes,,,"It's hard for me to say without reading the actual research article, but my guess is that temperature is referring to energy of each of the photons relative to one another. Meaning, if you were shining a laser beam down the z axis, typically the photons would also have some small velocity in the x and y directions (this would mean the light beam is diverging). So looking in a frame of reference moving along the z axis at the speed of the photons in the z direction, you would notice that most of the photons would be stationary in the z direction but are slowly moving in the x and y directions. The temperature is probably referring to the average kinetic energy of the photons in the x and y directions. So in order to get the photons all into a single state, you would want their x and y velocities to all be zero.\nThat's my guess, I know sometimes temperature can refer to similar scenarios with a beam of atoms. Like with the LHC, they often refer to the atoms as having a very low temperature. However, the atoms are moving around in circles at very nearly the speed of light. With such a high kinetic energy, you would expect the atoms to have a high temperature. But really, the atoms are moving very slowly relative to one another, and thus temperature is referring to this kinetic energy.",1290639157

I know most of the principles of object oriented design, but I've never tutored anyone before or had to explain object oriented programming to anyone. Eventually, the kid wants to learn how to program iPhone apps, but he understands that I've never done that before and we both think it would be best if he learned the fundamentals of programming first.<p>Are there any particularly good books I should read / have the kid read?

Anything that has any form of energy has mass, since those are just two different words for the same property. Because of this, the photons can be called ""massless"" (i.e. no rest mass) but still have mass, and the condensate could in theory have mass without any of its constituents having mass. The photons have mass from their individual kinetic energies, and the condensate could have mass beyond that from any potential energy required to get it into that state. Although, if the condensate is stable in any sense, it probably has <i>less</i> mass than the sum of the energies of its photons, with the difference being the loss of potential energy it gains from being stable.<p>As a comparison, atomic nuclei are composed of particles with non-zero rest mass, and they tend to have less mass than the sum of their components  because of their stability. The difference between the mass of the nuclei and its components is how much energy you have to dump into the nuclei to split it (plus enough kinetic energy so that they fly away before they reform).<p>As to the question of what constitutes ""matter""...

They consider changes and additions to their API only under the following circumstances:<p>They add methods and classes, either from Cocoa or their own extensions, if they add substantial value and don't interfere with OpenStep and/or Cocoa compatibility.\nThey generally don't remove things unless there is a clearly better implementation in newer Cocoa API\nWhere there is a real problem with a change, they will attempt find a technically superior work-around.  In rare cases, this might involve a change in the original OpenStep API<p>We depart somewhat from the GNUstep adherence in that our goal is to thoroughly modernize the framework and optimize it to target modern consumer electronic (CE) devices.

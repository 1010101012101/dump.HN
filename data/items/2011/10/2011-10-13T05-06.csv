It's quiet and safe and there are a lot of kids between 7 and 13 (who, for the most part, all seem to be very well-behaved, kind, respectful kids) running around playing. They're usually outside, on bikes, playing ball, or some made-up game, water gun fights, etc. On rainy days, they'll end up at someone's house, which does sometimes mean movies and video games, but it's just as often LEGOs.

It's like the blue and red pill.<p>I'm not sure how you define startups but that's subjective and I think all new companies are startups. I would say most new companies have a clear revenue model in the beginning and it's all about making it happen or pivot till you got it right.

So far it seems to work out really well, people are interested in sharing their apps and providing each other recommendations. You see this in real life all the time. We meet up, put our phones on the table, and often the conversation is lead to ""what apps do you use"". We try to stimulate and support these types of conversations.\nThere are more reasons why this approach is valid. Gaming reviews is less important because you wil trust a review of a person you know. It may be more interesting to see the most popular apps of your friends instead of the most popular in the app store. \nAnd finally, we have spend a lot of effort trying to provide excellent app detection. The reason for this is two-fold. it helps you get started quickly as a user, but more importantly it helps us to understand what apps people have and use, allowing us to provide qualitative  recommendations. It is better to get a few users to download your app and then really use it, then get a whole lot of users downloading it and running it once because of a mismatch.",1318485295

3106279,comment,3101876,3103255,2,0,koko775,,,"So this is somewhat related, somewhat off topic from the subject at hand, but...\n----<p>As for bringing content owners on board - as far as I can tell, they did. Their developer support was also very responsive. A+ on forming a dialogue with developers.<p>Their problem IMO is that they don't appear to feel it in their bones how important product differentiation is. Maybe they get it, but I don't think it's sunk in.<p>Allow me to elaborate. What's the difference between an embedded device, a phone, a mini-tablet, a tablet, and GoogleTV? Well...<p>* Embedded devices might have a pre-2.x Android that never got updated. But that's okay, nobody develops apps for them anyways.<p>* Phones probably have 2.1, maybe 2.2.<p>* A mini-tablet could be 2.1 or 2.2, and has the mobile device UI.<p>* A tablet might have 3.0 or 3.1 on it.<p>* GoogleTV has 3.0 on it, but its market app might filter like it's 3.1. How do you differentiate this in code? Version specifiers, specifying notouch (which will break if googletv ever supports any kind of touchscreen, on a large screen size (which is smaller than a tablet, which has a extra large screen), etc.<p>Want to develop for iOS? Great. Would you like iPhone or iPad? Or both? Need to make sure it works on 99.9% of the devices that can download it? No problem. And hopefully, sometime in the future, maybe Apple will see fit to enable the AppleTV for developers.<p>Circling back to address your statements, if Google's aim, or one of them, is to make GoogleTV into a gaming platform, I don't have much confidence in Google's ability to deliver on that goal, because GoogleTV is little more than a revision of Android plus some optional APIs, and Android is architected as a multi-device platform. It's not a single device with multiple revisions, as is the case with the iPhone 3G/3GS/4/4S sequence, or even the Nintendo DS and its subsequent revisions. There are reasons that Android isn't as compelling a game platform as iOS is, and that is a big one.<p>With respect to building a multimedia application platform, GoogleTV has potential if for no other reason than it's one of the few set-top boxes with an app store, period, and a programming interface that isn't thoroughly obtuse, but the GTV's design and usability are very weak, almost pre-alpha, even, as if it were scarcely more than a straight-up port of Android's touch-optimized interface with an inadequate amount of polish. It's nothing your average TV-watching user is going to grok, if the keyboard+mouse remote didn't clue you in.<p>Really, what it comes down to is that, even for hardware, Google just doesn't seem to want to release something ""perfect"". They just want ""shippable"" -- or I daresay ""just barely shippable"" - if you can call it that. Even if they have critical bugs, so long as developers can work around them, even if they haven't nailed down the UI, and make a sweeping change right before public release, that's still ""good enough"". And ""good enough"" is the enemy of ""great"".<p>Until Google puts design thinking into their products from the ground up, as you put it, they aren't going to be able to lead the marketplace.<p>/rant",1318485098

3106263,comment,3101876,3105458,4,0,msg,,,"It's a little hard to talk about this broad topic without  bloviating. Here goes.<p>So first, take that stuff Steve said about extensibility to heart. He has another blog somewhere, oh here it is<p><a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.ht...</a><p>about software that is alive because it's extensible. That is true of your startup too. You don't want to be a ""site"", you want to be a ""service"". And that means you want to be an authority for a unique kind of data, that you want your users to create and use.<p>I think the Google+ data is pretty unique and cool. I like the user experience. But you can't call it a service, which is bad news until they get their crap together.<p>I'm a strong believer that flowing data puts pressure on software to work correctly. You want a public API because you don't assume that you and your team are world class geniuses who have exhausted the search space of valid use cases for your data... but your customers can, close enough. (A very Amazon virtue: start with the customer.)<p>You want to have a well-designed interface for yourself and your users because it's so painful to scale, migrate, control security, etc. without it. So sure, I would say start with it as early as you can stand. Make it public as soon as you can. Allow your users to contribute and build on your data and service.<p>You'll probably treat your public-facing interfaces with different levels of scrutiny than internal-only ones. This is convenient, but it might be a mistake. You don't want to put off security or user data integrity until it's too late.<p>Having multiple services means that you can scale them independently. This costs some overhead but you'll be able to right-size your hardware, say with appropriate fleets in EC2.<p>Sorry that's all kind of generic, but that's about as deep as I would go without a real-world example to talk about.<p>The High Scalability blog is one I would recommend at the leading edge of this thing.

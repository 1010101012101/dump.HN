Also, please spare me the expected ""This is all anecdotal/sample size of 30"" follow-up. Perhaps you can answer the real question -- is this valuable to anyone if it has a significant error margin? I think it wouldn't be allowed a margin of more than 1% if it were to be useful, and even that is kind of pushing it if you intend to do anything important with the data -- if 20 sites are tested per visitor, a 1% error rate would mean that an incorrect detection would occur every fifth visitor or so.

Still awaiting moderation so I thought I'd share:<p>Anyway, youve probably noticed with close reading that Grahams essays are almost entirely declarative. He tells, almost never shows.<p>With Paul Graham, everything is a statement, even the questions are really statements in disguise. He may talk about meandering, but really he doesnt meander at all. His writing dictates, it doesnt explore. And when he accuses thesis-driven essays of blustering through and hand-waving, its rather funny, isnt it?<p>Thats exactly what Paul Graham does, all the time.<p>With all those statements, he doesnt leave any room in his essays for the reader.<p>Added bonus: As a narrator, he never changes or grows, which makes it exceedingly boring for the reader unless they have a feeling of personal vindication over what hes stating. (E.g., the reason you didnt like school was because you are smart. As a hacker, you are gods gift to the earth, etc.)<p>Its like going to your boring grandfathers house and being lectured to.<p>(Fun fact: so is listening to Paul Graham speak live. He reads an essay. Im not kidding.)<p>Meanwhile changing and growing is the raison dtre of fiction, as you described yourself when you compared his essay to Sonnys Blues.<p>Honestly, Im not surprised that your students dont like it [1]. Maybe one of the reasons they ask Who is this guy? is because that essay doesnt even bother to establish sympathy or credibility. No I was once a confused blah blah and learned the hard way blah blah. No Gee, isnt it aggravating when adults tell you what to do with your life? Wellllll<p>He presumes that the reader will hang on every word for no other reason than that the writer is Paul Graham.<p>[1] it referring to the essay What You'll Wish You'd Known: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html</a>",1322942116

3308607,comment,3303796,3307677,1,0,geoffschmidt,,,"My argument is that there is natural scarcity not of <i>copies</i> of a piece of information, but of the <i>value</i> that can be extracted from it. Scarcity is relevant to movie tickets because only so many people want to see a particular movie this Friday night. Let's say that in San Francisco there are 1000 such people. If only 5 movie theaters can show the movie, they might sell 200 tickets each. If 50 movie theaters can show the movie, they're not going to sell 200 tickets each. Collectively they will still sell at most 1000 tickets. They have to divide a scarce resource -- the <i>value</i> of the information to moviegoers on that particular night in SF. Once the information is adequately distributed, no matter how many copies you make, you won't increase that value.<p>So, instead of tracking the physical copies -- which I think we'd both agree are an irrelevant artifact of an antiquated distribution system -- I think we should talk about the value that is created for humanity when someone comes up with a new piece of information. When I make a movie, I've added a certain amount of value to the world. When I establish that a molecule can safely be used to treat a disease, I've added a certain amount of value to the world. It is hard to find units to measure this value (revenue potential in USD is a distorted one), but it is undoubtedly finite, and different for each movie or drug. None of this changes with your sci-fi replicator.<p>The question is, should I as the creator of the information be able to capture all that value? Some of that value? None of that value?<p>If we thought of IP as a natural right, we'd say ""all."" Copyright would be perpetual and there'd be no fair use. In a post-scarcity world where everyone got food and housing and paint and movie cameras for free, we might say ""none"" and hope (correctly I think) that people would still create for the pleasure of creation.<p>Historically in the US we've said ""some,"" nominally because we think it maximizes the rate of production of value for the commons, but in fact because of the natural vulnerability of our legislative system to capture by rent-seeking copyright aggregators. It is like a resonant frequency of democratic capitalism.",1322941838

According to this law, the first digit is 1 about 30% of the time, and larger digits occur as the leading digit with lower and lower frequency, to the point where 9 as a first digit occurs less than 5% of the time. This distribution of first digits is the same as the widths of gridlines on the logarithmic scale.<p>> This counter-intuitive result has been found to apply to a wide variety of data sets, including electricity bills, street addresses, stock prices, population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, physical and mathematical constants, and processes described by power laws (which are very common in nature).

We have been to the moon. We could go again, for less money, if we wanted to. Does the fact that we have decided not to have any bearing on the economics of spaceflight?<p>The linked article is not particularly convincing. Rather than begin with a short introduction and then present factual evidence for why space is infeasible, the author complains emotionally about the entertainment industry and how the public in general has inaccurate views of space.<p>Then he goes on to say that space is big.<p>Then he tells us that space is dangerous.<p>I seriously found it hard to finish this article.

No doubt our technique would improve with additional research.<p>I could go on...but the truth is that the only thing this article proves to me is that the author doesn't <i>want</i> space to be a feasible option.<p>I am convinced that we are currently biding our time and improving our technology. It makes little sense for us to spend a ton of money getting someone to Mars now if in 20 years we can do it for a third the cost.

He renewed his driver's license by mail one year when we lived very far from the state where he was registered as a voting citizen (paying taxes and keeping his driver's license from there).  It showed up with no photo and in place of the photo it clearly stated that it was valid as proof of license to drive but was <i>not</i> to be used as ""identification"".  He was on recruiting duty, so we weren't actually near a military base.  Which meant that for the first time in his life, no one wanted to take his military ID (with photo and SSN on it) as ID if he wrote a check or something.  They all wanted his driver's license, which he would then whip out and show them it couldn't be used for ID purposes.  This stumped a great many people in entry level retail jobs.",1322938826

6125007,comment,6124462,6124462,24,0,foobarbazqux,,,"> Willpower and cognitive processing draw from the same pool of resources.<p>Like many things in psychology, this is basically unfalsifiable.  Our brains have pools of resources?  How do you even differentiate between willpower and cognitive processing at a neurological level?  It&#x27;s one model, but there are other equally valid but also unfalsifiable explanations.  What about anxiety goes up after working on a hard problem (memorizing a 7-digit number, apparently) - maybe you can test this by measuring cortisol levels - and so you choose the (stereotypically) more satisfying and rewarding dessert (cake) as a form of emotional eating and also, you know, rewarding yourself for a job well done?<p>I mean, it&#x27;s basically just saying, &quot;Use your brain, and your brain will get tired.  Both solving problems and doing something you don&#x27;t want to do count as using your brain.&quot;  Sure, but I hardly need an experiment to tell me that.<p>Also, what about people who perform better under stress?  Since it requires willpower to work hard and meet a deadline, and since the quality of your cognitive processing also goes up (for an initial period), doesn&#x27;t that defeat the &quot;competing for the same pool of resources&quot; claim?<p>Psychology is great and a lot of the unfalsifiable stuff is valuable but it&#x27;s irritating when it&#x27;s dressed up as science.",1375149591

6125004,comment,6119673,6121654,5,0,maxharris,,,"<i>This is exactly what is wrong with health care in a free market.</i><p>What free market are you talking about? Medicare effectively controls the prices of medical procedures (since insurance companies reimburse non-Medicare recipients on the basis of tables the government puts out). It also controls the number of doctors (it does this by limiting the number of residency slots - see the Balanced Budget Act of 1997). The FDA regulates everything from the development and testing to packaging and marketing of drugs, medical devices and related products. Due to federal regulations, physicians are not permitted to discuss prices with one another. There are countless regulations that manipulate health insurance. And don&#x27;t forget the 1943 IRS ruling that permanently established the link between health insurance and your employer.<p>And this is all stuff that&#x27;s mostly <i>decades</i> before Obamacare. That just scratches the surface. For example, I didn&#x27;t even mention HMOs, which were created under Nixon via another set of regulations intended to control costs for things Johnson had done.<p>A <i>free market</i> in health care? If there&#x27;s <i>one thing</i> American health care has <i>not</i> had in the last 50 years, it&#x27;s a free market. Sure, it has been slightly freer than in other countries, but that&#x27;s not saying much.",1375149507

6124999,comment,6124738,6124738,1,0,aggieben,,,"I find this pretty interesting.  I&#x27;m not sure I agree with the point about the phone, though.  For me, a phone call is in the chain of escalation, and not an effective communication tool at the lowest level.  Consider: it is the most demanding form of communication, allows for little or no transfer of data, hampers our ability to communicate abstractions, and doesn&#x27;t scale at all.  If audio communication is important, then prefer video calling.  Still, I find written communication to be the most cost-effective form of communication.  It allows for a wide range of expression, can be performed asynchronously, and can be archived and searched for later reference.  Phone calls cannot.  I even once had a boss for whom I responded in writing when he called with questions or instructions because he wasn&#x27;t an honest broker, and it was vital to pin him down in writing in every detail.<p>My preference goes something like this: chat (IM, something custom, whatever), video call (hangout, skype, etc.), email, text, phone call, in-person.   Of course the order may vary depending on circumstances - obviously you don&#x27;t have casual conversation via SMS when out to lunch with someone, or if you work in the same room - but this is generally how I view the value of communications.  Phone calls are productivity killers.",1375149221

So, even if memcached is doing good work for lots of folks, the distinct features of groupcache probably address real needs in the app.<p>And, yeah, groupcache and the dl.google.com rewrite are Go partly because Brad likes Go, but both projects had reasons to exist quite apart from deploying Go for Go&#x27;s sake.",1375148880

6124872,comment,6124306,6124306,25,0,agwa,,,"SSH host keys are problematic on cloud servers, not just because of this problem, but also because if the cloud provider does the right thing and generates the SSH host key on the first boot, the key is generated when the system has very little entropy available.  The primary sources of entropy on Linux are key/mouse input, disk latency, and network interrupts.  There&#x27;s obviously no keyboard/mouse on a server, and in an SSD environment like DigitalOcean, disk latency is quite uniform and thus useless as a source of entropy.<p>Linux distros mitigate the cold boot entropy problem by saving some state from the RNG on shutdown (on Debian, it&#x27;s saved in /var/lib/urandom/random-seed) and using it to seed the RNG on the next boot.  On physical servers this obviously isn&#x27;t available on the first boot, and on cloud servers, the provider often bakes the same random-seed file into all their images, so everyone gets the same seed on first boot (fortunately this doesn&#x27;t harm security any more than having no random-seed file at all, but it doesn&#x27;t help either).  What cloud providers should really do is generate (from a good source of randomness) a distinct random-seed file for every server that&#x27;s created, but I haven&#x27;t seen any providers do this.",1375146678

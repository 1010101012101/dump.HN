With this perspective in mind, self-perpetuating monopolies are almost always a bad thing (unless you believe in such things as centralized planning and dictatorships).<p>Okay, but the more famous economists are usually at the 
more famous universities which tend to have large
endowments and tend to want to get high returns and
often do this by investing in VCs who look for
monopolies that can return money enough to pay for
the professors of economics!<p>Actually, whatever gets taught or suggested in the
classrooms, it&#x27;s both common and easy enough for the
high end universities to look for and like
students who are wealthy or relatively likely to become
wealthy and make significant donations 
back to the university -- no joke.  Or, universities
are not against monopolies everywhere on campus!",1412733467

8424905,comment,8424182,8424776,0,0,mdasen,,,"You&#x27;ve brought up an interesting point: correlation vs causation.  One of the issues in discrimination contexts today is disparate impact.  For example, we know that a bank couldn&#x27;t say, &quot;we don&#x27;t want to lend money to black people.&quot;  Race is a protected class and that&#x27;s discrimination against a protected class.  What if the bank said, &quot;we don&#x27;t want to lend money to people in cities&quot;?  Now we&#x27;re into disparate impact land.  Racial minorities are often more in cities and this policy could have an adverse impact against certain groups along racial lines.  The kind of questions that are then often asked are things like, &quot;is there a business purpose?&quot; and &quot;is there no tighter indicator that the bank could use for their business purpose that wouldn&#x27;t have the same disparate impact?&quot;<p>Ultimately, disparate impact is about not using indicators that have a racial bias when better indicators exist.  The bank might say, &quot;we use city residence because people in cities usually have a history of missed debt payments.&quot;  Regulators could retort, &quot;then why not just use an individuals history of made and missed debt payments?&quot;  Disparate impact isn&#x27;t about preventing the use of all indicators that correlate with a protected class.  However, companies often use indicators that are of dubious predictive power (things where one can&#x27;t show a significant correlation with the bad outcome the company wants to avoid, but show a strong correlation with a protected class).<p>Since the article is about analytics, one can imagine building a bayesian model and a few test subjects to put through it.  We could think about features that are probably predictive like missed payments.  We could also have features like height which should be nonsense.  For the sake of this silly model, let&#x27;s say that one racial group is shorter and is a greater credit risk.  You create your &quot;height < 6ft&quot; feature and your &quot;has > 2 missed payments&quot; bernoulli variables and start training your model based on your training set.  You find that &quot;has > 2 missed payments&quot; is very predictive, but you also find that &quot;height < 6ft&quot; is also predictive.  But there&#x27;s a certain, &quot;um, we know that the feature is correlated with a protected class and there&#x27;s no good, logical reason to use it unless you&#x27;re trying to create a proxy for that protected class so you can discriminate&quot; that might go through one&#x27;s head.",1412731855

It is, in a way, a very old idea in the business world.
The value of Thiel&#x27;s way of stating it (very, very boldly and controversially) is that it makes people in the startup world actually listen to it. And that&#x27;s a very good thing

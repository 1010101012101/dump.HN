(I'm not picking on Xobni, in particular...it's just become a pretty common thing.  There have been rumblings about Facebook being ""the next Google"", for example...but it's not at all apparent they have anything remotely approaching the capability to deliver Google-style revenue, and every day of healthy but moderate growth is evidence that they've failed to deliver the explosive growth that ""the next Google"" would deliver.)",1196847579

It's not terrible across the modern Open Source platforms, like Linux and FreeBSD (and there's pretty good doc coverage of building compatible makefiles or using GNU autotools), but on systems that don't have the GNU autotools, and have a proprietary make, it can be incredibly painful to deal with.<p>It's been a few years since I dealt with distributing C across many platforms, but I can't imagine it's changed dramatically for the better (since make has been famously painful for about as long as it has existed).",1234045976

471549,comment,471519,471519,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If the project is larger than trivial: Perl, unless you need an X-based GUI.<p>Shell has the problem of being inconsistent across several platforms.../bin/sh on Linux systems (except Ubuntu) is BASH, but on FreeBSD, Solaris, and others it is a classic shell.  If you are extremely careful, you can write in very standard sh, but it's a pretty challenging language to build anything bigger than 100 lines or so (I built our installer in sh, and I've regretted it ever since it grew up to about 300 lines...it's now at 1143 lines, and I'm in the midst of translating it to Perl, where it will be dramatically shorter and more powerful.<p>Anyway, Perl is pervasive, and has been backward compatible for about a hundred million years.  I have code that I wrote 11 years ago that runs unmodified on modern Perl 5.10.  This means that if you target, say, Perl 5.8, you can expect your program to run on any system that has pretty much any Perl version less than 7 years old.  (If you go back too far, you lose a lot of really nice features that make programming in Perl enjoyable.  Unicode didn't get perfected in Perl until 5.8.2, I think, maybe 5.8.4, so we consider that our baseline and what we target.)<p>Python, while it's very nice and also widely available on many platforms, is <i>not</i> particularly backward compatible.  If you target Python 2.4 or 2.6, it will not run on Python 2.2.  If you shoot for a least common denominator, you will <i>still</i> find there are some incompatibilities.  I worked on several Python projects a few years ago during the transition from 1.5 to 2.0, and that code required serious changes...then several minor changes from 2.0->2.2->2.4.  I wasn't around on those projects when 2.6 came along, nor 3.0, but I get the feeling that both required some changes and brought some incompatibilities.  While this may lead to a cleaner language, it means you have numerous concerns about cross-platform compatibility, and your testing requirements go <i>way</i> up.  My Perl testing environment consists of a Perl 5.8.mumble installation, and nothing more.  If it runs there, I know it'll run on every version from then up to 5.10.x, which spans about seven years worth of Perl versions.<p>Binaries are practically impossible for this task.  People expect native packages, which are extremely time-consuming to build and test.  Linux distros break backward compatibility in their libraries regularly, so you'll have to ship statically linked binaries.  On platforms that don't break backward compatibility, like Solaris, you still have to assume a pretty minimal environment, since those systems are quite anemic on the library front, so again, you're shipping statically linked binaries.  And, the moment you get a customer that wants it for some whacked out platform like HP/UX on Itanium, you'll be kicking yourself...and you <i>will</i> get customers running bizarre systems, if you call yourself cross-platform.<p>If you need an X-based GUI, Tcl/Tk might still be the best choice (five or ten years ago it was the only sane choice for such a creature).  Perl has good bindings for Tk and WxWindows, but neither is likely to be available.  Python has Tk bindings out of the box, so if you hate Tcl, and like Python, and need a GUI, this might push Python into the lead.  The biggest problem with Tcl is that it's just not very active or growing.  Perl and Python, on the other hand, have very vibrant communities.  All are pretty good languages, though, in their own way...though I never really got the hang of Tcl whereas Perl and Python seemed pretty natural.<p>To pile on the anecdotal evidence, my co-founders project, Webmin, is probably one of the most cross-platform pieces of software in existence...supporting at <i>least</i> 150 different operating systems and versions (the last time I counted in 2003, it added up to about 150 variants, not including architectures, and probably 30 or 40 new variants have been added since then).  It's about 350,000 lines of Perl, plus a touch of sh for the installer.<p>Of course, this assumes all things being equal.  Do you hate Perl?  If so, it's probably not worth working in it just for compatibility (though I suspect you don't know modern Perl very well, if you truly hate it).  You can just tell your customers to install Python, if they don't have it, or upgrade if they do.  I find the two languages roughly equal in terms of how much I like working with them, and how productive I can be.<p>The other cool choices, like Ruby, Lua, Lisp, Haskell, all have the problem of being unavailable, by default, on most UNIX systems...and so you'd have to support your users in installing the language, as well as your app.",1234045567

These traits are discriminated against by admissions officers and hiring managers.

My copy of Modern Information Retrieval (1999) is starting to show its age as well and from glancing through the table of contents, as pointed out in Greg's post, this really seems to hit a lot of the recent trends in IR.

471543,comment,468180,468972,0,0,alabut,,,"Well, the lighter text does punish the original poster, indirectly. It lowers the likelihood of engagement by an audience and I like that subtle approach more than heavy-handed alert warnings. Sites that have that kind of approach feel like I'm in the principal's office and being scolded for no good reason. Subtle encouragement to do other types of behavior feels more like I'm in a hippie montessori school instead - we're not going to come down with the stick if you behave a certain way, but we're not going to give you the carrot unless you do better.",1234045231

Change our environment so that our lives aren't so hollow and empty. The reason these addictions take hold is because, for example, people are accomplishing absolutely zero in their lives so they need the fake feeling of accomplishment and respect from hitting level 60 in WoW. If we re-engineer society so that people actually have an opportunity to make friends, do productive work, get exercise, etc. these things won't be nearly as dangerous as they are today.",1234045228

You get what you want to out of it.""<p>Agreed. Also, some books are stimulating, but some are really vapid. Generalizing about any medium as a whole is probably a bad idea, except in relation to the factors shaping it. For example, I think that media which makes money by holding your attention long enough to expose you to ads (some tv and blogs, most magazines) have a strong incentive to produce content that grabs your attention but isn't necessarily deep.",1234045047

If you're a coder and would rather create crude functional demos first, then you should have the html/css chops to layer in visual polish via background images or etc.<p>Either way, designer or coder, it helps to concentrate on the rough functionality first and then layer things in later, like typography, logos, icons, color schemes and other visual polish.<p>I'm giving a talk at Adobe in about a week and a half on the subject of rapid prototyping in Fireworks, I think there'll be a screencast or video going on, for anyone interested:<p><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Fire-On-The-Bay/calendar/9583191/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/Fire-On-The-Bay/calendar/9583191/</a><p>And don't just take my word for it, Mark Boulton's got a great PDF book out with the same approach, if you're interested in improving your process as a designer:<p><a href=""http://www.fivesimplesteps.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fivesimplesteps.co.uk/</a>",1234044307

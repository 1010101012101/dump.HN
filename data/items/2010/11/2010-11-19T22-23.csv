1923144,comment,1923019,1923019,0,0,cheald,,,"Gruber seems to make the assertion that a platform only has worth based on its exclusive ""killer apps"". He goes wrong there and never really recovers. Android's strength is not its suite apps, it's its flexibility. It runs on an enormous range of hardware, and doesn't require that you buy into a single vendor's toolchain to use it. The core philosophical difference between the two platforms is ""Steve Jobs decides what's best for me"" versus ""I decide what's best for me"".<p>So what are the killer apps? How about things like Launcher Pro, Swype, SwiftKey, and AppBrain? Why don't we talk about Chrome To Phone or the FM Radio listener (via Cyanogen)? Those are all things that just don't - and can't - exist on the iPhone, but the glory of them is that I get to choose them. I can pick my own homescreen app and tweak the heck out of it. I can pick an input method that I want (SwiftKey has made my iPhone-using friends turn green with envy on more than occassion). I can install new apps without ever having to tether to my computer with iTunes. I can send a map or recipe from my computer to my phone and take my work with me seamlessly. These are all ""killer features"", but they aren't ""apps"" in the Apple sense of the word - they're features, extensions of the platform, which let me use my device as best I see fit.<p>If everything Apple does is exactly what you want, Android probably doesn't have any ""killer features"" worth talking about, but as soon as you want to do something that diverges from the Cupertino Grand Unified Vision, Android starts to become a lot more attractive. Given Gruber's leanings, it's little wonder that he's not enamored with Android. Doesn't mean that's the case for everyone - and the market bears that out quite well.",1290206957

I was wrong.  The ethically correct response is to let an instructor know if you've already seen an exam that has been just handed to you.  At that point, the only person in the wrong is the instructor who was too lazy to create a test that would have been new for their students.<p>Note - it's one thing for a high-school student to screw up (as I did) - we can only hope that the teacher calls them on it, and they learn from their experience (as I like to believe I did).

This is a perfectly fair question. I think the response from the Apple camp would be that it is the wrong question. The question they're more interested in is <i>how</i> things are done, not what features are available. This is why they focus so much on design, polish, and experience, and less on providing the widest possible functionality. Along the same lines, notice that Gruber criticizes several Android apps for being knock-offs of iPhone apps, or for having relatively poor quality compared to their iPhone counterparts. I think this shows that his focus is on the how rather than the what, and that his discussion of exclusive apps has less to do with functionality, and more to do with how sticky the platform is. Neither side is necessarily right or wrong, but it's important to recognize that they are asking fundamentally different questions.",1290206683

To avoid this issue of people not knowing how the test is going to look like (and hence not knowing how to study for it), I decided to make two versions of each test question (and each question focuses on a simple part of the material that I want them to take home) and randomly assign each version of a question either to the actual test or to a practice test that I give them out a week or so before the actual test and then solve the practice test in front of them, clearly stating what I do and don't expect them to do.<p>Now, in the first test they did well, but in the second test a significant fraction of the class (like 60+%) just wrote in their tests _my_ answers to the practice questions, and some argued that since there was some similarity they should get half credit or something. My reaction was, and still is, wtf?",1290206292
1923101,comment,1922773,1922773,0,0,grellas,,,"Ah, the poor debt collector, what a burden he carries these days.<p>When I started in my legal career over 30 years ago, debt collectors could declare open season on their victims and pretty much harass them without limit: calling up at all hours of the night, lying through their teeth about what might happen if you did not accede to their demands, pestering friends, relatives, employers, and anyone else in reach once they had exhausted their arsenal on the hapless debtor, and when all that didn't work, cynically start the process up again the next day until the poor soul was worn out from the continuous beating.<p>All of this has radically changed in the past several decades, to the point where debtors (and, dare I say, deadbeats too) now pretty much have the upper hand with collectors when it comes to fending off their efforts to win through harassment or intimidation. A fascinating write-up on this appears here (<a href=""http://www.dallasobserver.com/2010-01-21/news/better-off-deadbeat-craig-cunningham-has-a-simple-solution-for-getting-bill-collectors-off-his-back-he-sues-them/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dallasobserver.com/2010-01-21/news/better-off-dea...</a>) and that piece in turn sparked an interesting HN discussion on the topic (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1075903"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1075903</a>).<p>Essentially, there are now innumerable laws that permit debtors to sue debt collectors who slip up on even small issues in the way they handle their collection efforts. What is more, the entire industry depends on hiring low-skilled workers whose main talent is to intimidate and such persons are normally not astute enough to avoid the legal traps. The hope is that most people will remain ignorant of the laws protecting debtors while the harassment continues.<p>Accordingly, this game turns on playing the percentages. I have dealt with people at the wholesale end of this business and, believe me, the amounts they pay to acquire debt packages are miniscule in relation to the size of the debts involved (often as low as 1% of the face amount of the paper). Thus, it is rare that any of this ever winds up being pursued in court (at least for the low-quality packages) because that would never pay. The goal, rather, is to scare people into paying. This means, of course, first finding the person so that the process can begin. And this in turn places a <i>huge</i> premium on whatever data might exist by which a debtor might be tracked.<p>So, yes, the debt collectors will use all forms of social media available as well as any accompanying tricks that might lead to finding their targets. Facebook may adopt policies to try to limit some of this but I would doubt that this would be effective except against flagrant offenders. Anti-harassment laws likely would be more effective, assuming the debtor is savvy enough to know about them and to use them effectively.<p>In the meantime, this cat-and-mouse game will continue on and on, as it has for eons, only it will now involve the new playing ground of social media.",1290206219

I have no reason to doubt that that Alex Kipman and Shannon Loftis were being completely genuine, but it also wouldn't surprise me if MS' legal department tried legal action later on anyway.  In a company with stronger leadership at the top, you might see a more consistent response (or at least a clear break when policies change), but I wouldn't expect that from MS.",1290204321

Much greater with SQLite vs (most) other SQL engines.<p>I still see it as killing something out of some ulterior motive rather than supporting something highly effective.  SQLite exists because it has survived against <i>many</i> competitors for a <i>long</i> time.  It's not like this is some new, untested thing that cropped up out of nowhere.<p>edit: just realized there's a <i>much</i> stronger argument here.  And a bigger threat.<p>By not supporting WebDatabase, because the implementers all used SQLite, they've essentially <i>guaranteed</i> that they will never support an SQL-based database.  Few are going to want to compete with SQLite on its own turf as an embedded database when it's already so optimized.  <i>Especially</i> if they all have to agree on a spec similar to SQLite.<p>SQLite isn't even all that poor of a match for a JS-interfaced database.  JS is nearly as fast and loose with its types as SQLite, and the types that <i>do</i> exist are very close to what JS has.",1290204192

Big Mistake.<p>I more or less agree and voted you up, but if the guy's asking for 1/3rd of the company at $750k, does that mean he's putting in $250k cash? That might be the lesser of two evils here. Can't really say without more detail, but sometimes you've got to bite the bullet and choose between a few different bad courses of action.<p>What I'm curious about is if the company has made <i>any</i> revenue yet.

It has verbiage in it that basically allows him to come on as a voting shareholder, with the ability to ascend to a director once he feels ""he is ready"".<p>His readiness is mostly contingent on industry knowledge.  We're in a space that is largely unknown to him, and he wants to take the time to bring himself up to speed before taking a more active role in the company.<p>One of the reasons we're feeling trepidatious is that we haven't spoken to the man since August, save two email.  The rest of our interactions have been with his lawyer, who, while civil, has been a bit onerous to work with.<p>We're just not sure if this is an indication of how our relationship will work going forward, or if this is merely a difficult courtship period that could result in a truly beneficial working relationship down the road.",1290204045

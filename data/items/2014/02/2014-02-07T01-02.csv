About OpenGL I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m a good example to follow, in my case I mostly needed to understand how to setup, send vertices to OpenGL, set colors, activate blending, once I figured that out I abstracted that stuff away in a Processing-like API (setColor, drawRect, translate...) so I could forget about all that stuff. I figured things out mostly by skimming through this book [1], looking at the Processing code base, OpenGL tutorials, Stack Overflow... For the odd texture I still use the Texture2D class from Apple&#x27;s examples. Note that at the time there were not many good OpenGL libraries for iOS, now things are different, OpenFrameworks works on iOS, there&#x27;s Cinder, etc. Had I started a year later I probably could have skipped all that stuff instead of building my own library.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-3D-Graphics-Kaufmann-Computer/dp/0123737273"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-3D-Graphics-Kaufmann-Computer/d...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://processing.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://processing.org/</a>",1391738322

When this company wanted to do it, their counsel said it was illegal, so they didn&#x27;t.<p>Given those facts, we can&#x27;t say that the other 200 companies were simply flummoxed by a too-complex regulatory framework. They may just have well had their own meetings and said, &quot;This looks fishy, but everyone else is doing it, and we get more money.&quot; Or maybe they did no due diligence at all, and just did it anyway. Once caught, obviously many people would claim an honest misunderstanding, whether or not there was one.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m skeptical of the whole, &quot;the jail sentences were handed out arbitrarily&quot; angle. It seems the opposite of arbitrary -- the person who instituted an illegal policy in multiple companies was punished. The law may be complex, but when you&#x27;re making C-level salaries, I&#x27;m sorry but you&#x27;re expected to figure out if you&#x27;re committing a crime or not.",1391738225

He was the only person I knew who got this kind of treatment, and the only obvious difference was his appearance.<p>And then there was this (1):<p>Washington Post: Sen. Kennedy Flagged by No-Fly List<p><i>U.S. Sen. Edward M. &quot;Ted&quot; Kennedy said yesterday that he was stopped and questioned at airports on the East Coast five times in March because his name appeared on the government&#x27;s secret &quot;no-fly&quot; list.<p>Federal air security officials said the initial error that led to scrutiny of the Massachusetts Democrat should not have happened even though they recognize that the no-fly list is imperfect. But privately they acknowledged being embarrassed that it took the senator and his staff more than three weeks to get his name removed.</i><p>If it took a powerful senator weeks or months to fix the problem, I knew it was hopeless for us mere mortals.<p>When I was in college many years ago, a punk band called the Dead Kennedys released an album called <i>Bedtime For Democracy</i> that had this famous piece of artwork (2). It was a cartoon representation of the Statue of Liberty, crawling with Wall Street thieves, jack-booted SWAT teams, Madison Avenue shills, and other cons and clowns. There were tears coming out of the statue&#x27;s eyes. Take a look at it zoomed in if you can, or buy the LP with the full-sized cover. I liked the DKs for their music and lyrics, and the cover went right along with the band&#x27;s brand of socio-political satire.

It&#x27;s fine for app internals, but for sharing small[2] open-source[3] components[4] it&#x27;s not a good idea—whether it&#x27;s Sass or CoffeeScript or Jade or whatever.<p>The other problem with CSS pre-processors specifically is that they only work well with the monolithic app mindset. All of your CSS files inside the same `styles` folder, and all of them required by the &quot;top of the monolith&quot; `main.sass` file. Instead, using something like component[5] you get true dependency trees, so you don&#x27;t have to go monolithic anymore. And trying to get Sass to work across a component-ized codebase is a real pain. Instead we use Myth[6] to &quot;post-process&quot; the built CSS.<p>Pre-processors are a leaky abstraction that comes back to bite you at random points the way all leaky abstractions do, and the ways are usually hard to foresee and thus hard to argue against when the benefits seems so clear.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://segment.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://segment.io</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/segmentio/toggle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/segmentio/toggle</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/segmentio/sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/segmentio/sheet</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://github.com/component/tip"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/component/tip</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://github.com/component/component"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/component/component</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://myth.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myth.io</a>",1391737898

They possess inherent and inborn qualities that make them stand out in the world firmament. They make a mark by dint of their sheer talent without making any kind of fuss for help or support. It is their natural instincts that take them along the right path, and make them innovative. Leading by example, and optimizing the use of available resources are the two essentials making one a leader. It was not circumstances that led them to become leaders, but their natural talent and instincts. Thus, leaders are born, not made. The article is dedicated to President Dr. Martin Luther King.

What Apple can do is promise to indemnify the individual developer for any out of pocket expenses above and beyond the initial settlement offer, as long as the developer chooses to use the free legal defense apple would provide, and not settle the case.<p>If the lawyer and the developer, for what ever reason, decide that it&#x27;s best to settle, it&#x27;s fine, in that case the developer would have to pay out of pocket for the settlement, but they would be no worse off, and they would get a free attorney helping them in either case.<p>For apple this arrangement would be relatively inexpensive, as long as they hire a nation wide firm. Since the causes of action in each case are exactly the same, the defense would be exactly the same, same expert opinions, same motions, etc. For developers that publish to both Google Play and App Store, it&#x27;s only fair if google would kick in 1/2 the costs, but if they do not, then it would be a huge PR win for apple.

6467016,comment,6466468,6466746,1,0,eitally,,,"< Typing from a hotel in SJ after having transferred through LAX this morning.><p>LAX isn&#x27;t so bad as a transfer spot.  I fly RDU-->SJC pretty regularly using the [pretty new] RDU<-->LAX direct with a commuter leg between LA & SJ.  My other alternative is SJC<-->ATL with the commuter leg between RDU<-->ATL.  If I&#x27;m going to fly a redeye I prefer to land at home rather than some midway point....  LAX is far better than JFK, not to mention O&#x27;Hare.  Having to leave security at JFK in order to do a terminal transfer via the sky train is one of the most frustrating things in flying.  So is having to return your rental car seemingly ten miles and a half dozen sky train stops from a terminal like at SFO.    In the US, I&#x27;ve really been quite impressed by the new Delta terminal in Detroit.<p>There are quite a few shitty, big international airports outside the US, too.  Imho, Guarulhos in So Paulo is the worst.  Barely air-conditioned, awful security experience for non-Brazilians, and zero real food after security.  I&#x27;ve never had Delhi or Mumbai as an endpoint, but flying through them and having to transfer from an international to a domestic flight, or vice versa, is irritating, too.  Lots of time spent looking for unmarked transfer bus stops, and more lack of aircon.  Also, what&#x27;s with the Indian practice of forcing a pre-check-in x-ray of both checked bags & carry-ons, but then arbitrarily x-ray or hand-search after check-in?  And, of course these x-ray stations have no signage and no indication of the fact that they&#x27;re required.  As maddening travel experiences go, this is right up there with visiting a country (like Chile) where they don&#x27;t really go out of their way to tell you a visa is required, and then pop a $130 charge on you upon arrival (this was instituted, like the Brazilian visa requirement for US citizens) as reciprocity for Bush&#x27;s US visa requirement for citizens of those countries.<p>Writing this I realize I come across as particularly more bitchy than normal, and that isn&#x27;t really intentional.  International air travel, though, is  -- imho -- broken and the experience frequent travelers have forced upon them is really quite awful.  And I&#x27;m complaining as someone who has platinum status, lounge access, and a handful of systemwide upgrades.  My $.02: when you get to whatever the top statuses are for any given airline, the &quot;perks&quot; they provide result in you actually having an experience that should be the status quo: free checked bags, economy &quot;comfort&quot; or &quot;plus&quot; seating, free onboard wifi and personal entertainment, snacks you don&#x27;t have to pay for, and not having to put up with carrier&#x27;s ridiculously inefficient boarding algorithms.",1380497710

The problem seems to be that if an insurance company is funding the defense then they have the same incentive to pay a settlement rather than fight that anyone else does, and that would just cause even <i>more</i> money to go into the pockets of trolls by giving them a deep pocket in the form of the insurance company, exacerbating the problem (and making the premiums unaffordable).<p>But let&#x27;s suppose we solve that by stipulating up front that the insurance money can&#x27;t be used for a settlement. If you want the money then you have to fight; it can only go to lawyers, not plaintiffs. <i>That</i> would be an interesting dynamic.

I just turned 40, have experience in PHP, Rails, lots Javascript (including Backbone, Knockout, a bit of Angular and learning Ember now), a bit of Python and learning Scala. No degree, and most of what I&#x27;ve worked on were internal corporate tools or start-ups that are no longer around.<p>I&#x27;ve been building out sample apps in newer Javascript frameworks so that along with learning the newer stuff, I have something in my portfolio that I can point too.<p>What I&#x27;ve found in my interviewing is that the biggest concern people have is that I&#x27;ll stick around for a few months to a year and then move on, it wasn&#x27;t until an interview last week that I explained to the CEO that the work I&#x27;d been doing was always project work, I didn&#x27;t regularly just pick-up and leave jobs. He wanted me to work for 60 days without pay so he could be sure that I wouldn&#x27;t leave without giving 60 days notice.<p>I&#x27;m in Sydney, Australia, and need full-time work to keep my visa or else have to go back to Canada.

Having an alias specifically for time_t is part of what makes this kind of work doable. I could see maybe introducing another alias like &quot;time64_t&quot; or something, but once you convert it to &quot;long long&quot; the type is no longer tagged in a way that makes it easy to find and more importantly suggests to the programmer they ought to NOT make assumptions about its size. Heck, in a perfect world I&#x27;d either introduce a new % symbol specifically for time_t width or have a macro that expands to represent its width (not to mention make it mandatory to use compiler warnings about string formats not matching argument widths).<p>I also found the comment about &quot;would love better compiler tools -- none found so far&quot;. Certainly there are things like Sparse (<a href=""https://sparse.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sparse.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page</a>) which correctness verification easier.",1380495730

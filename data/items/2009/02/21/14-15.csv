Now it comes up with a different drive letter and iTunes can't find any of your music.",1235227675
489851,comment,489827,489827,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"I just think it's the case where OOP does not implicitly guarantee the modularity and good architecture of applications, it simply provides a model where for many problem domains and with proper code discipline, it will. Nature always builds a better idiot.<p>Most importantly, I think it might be some sort of ""it's so expensive, it's GOT to work"" effect. The complexity of OOP patterns can be pretty ridiculous, so perhaps people dilligently code away using them because they feel like there's nothing better, or they feel like the complexity has to be good for something.",1235227592
489850,comment,489778,489833,0,0,bad_user,,,"I don't think so. As much as free-software advocates like to pat themselves on the back, there are many projects out there that succeeded gaining popularity without a restrictive license like the GPL, and I also think that the GPL is so popular purely by fashion and because its restrictions are irrelevant for web-based applications.<p>A project's success can only be attributed to the people working on it, and to sheer luck.<p>Of course, it is kind of an incentive for companies to contribute back and for the community to have some legal protection, that's why I understand the need for LGPL or MPL. But GPL itself should not be considered open-source ... all the software you or I wrote is and will always be a derivate of public domain, and the usage of a library should not dictate the distribution rights of the final product, but only the distribution rights of the library in question. It's kind of ironic that proprietary platforms like dotNET are more open in this regard.<p>Also, I don't think Apple did more harm to open-source than Red Hat did. At least they don't pretend to be some kind of saviors of humanity.",1235227573
489849,comment,489788,489832,0,0,jerf,,,"I would add a few more points: I forget the exact term, but be sure to engage in purposeful practice, always challenging yourself with a song <i>just</i> out of your reach. Start as easy as necessary and work up.<p>It would be helpful to do some songs that you can get the full score for, so you can do concrete validation of your correctness. However, be sure that they are the full, <i>true</i> score; grab a Guitar book of Beatles songs, for instance, and they're likely to be simplified in a way that won't help on this task.",1235227572
489848,comment,489467,489724,0,0,jerf,,,"""Sorry, but it doesn't matter who started a fight on the playground.""<p>It's an example, not the whole of the argument. And the example is more about the <i>principal</i> than the children. The principal should care about who is starting fights, if they actually want to affect whether there are fights in the future. They don't, for many reasons including ones discussed in the article, so they don't care, either.<p>School examples have the virtue of appealing to most people's common experience.",1235226858

489844,comment,489467,489737,0,0,Eliezer,,,"Well said.  I really have to wonder whether other people had such different childhoods than mine - if they were actually engaging in spontaneous random playground fights with no aggressor - or if they just have very convenient amnesia.<p>""How old is he and he still cares about such things"" - this question is the essence of why not caring is a pretension of wisdom, and I'm glad that the illustration was so nicely provided.",1235226296
489843,comment,488705,489808,0,0,imp,,,"Thanks for the reply, but I still think there's a huge disconnect.<p>First of all, you're admitting that it's okay for anonymous people to inflict a significant, measurable delay in page load time for my entire website.  That is completely unacceptable.<p>Also, while I'm sure your system is well designed, it probably isn't perfect (because nothing is).  If your monitoring service malfunctions then the tests might never cut off.<p>There should only be two levels of trust: people who own the server (and can test it), and people who don't own the server (and can do nothing to it).",1235225961

489837,comment,489788,489809,0,0,apologetic,,,"There is an explicit reason for why I called my blog 'Apologetic Writing' (it's also explicitly not within the context itself...).\nOf course, I can see there is such a thing as talent, but I rather define it as a group of human perks, that you are either born with, or have early developed due to some events, that are boosted mostly by realizing their existence and overall meaning, and then sharpening every each and one of them with a lot of practice.\nI have a few ""talents"", or as I love to call them, groups of perks uniformly supporting an adjacent field of mastery.\nMathematics, algorithmic thinking, art and linguistics.\nNone of those develop seriously over time by themselves if I don't put any time onto the subject.\nI have proof of course. In the past year, after living my life with the knowledge that I can sketch OK, and even better than most people I know. I have lifted the skill by practicing more often than usually (on a daily basis I'd draw between 3-6 quick pencil sketches).\nNow, withdrawing a sketch from a couple of years ago and comparing it to one I would quickly sketch in less than 10 minutes, I can tell that I got better by much.\n""Many untalented people attain mastery of an art through sheer determination and effort. But geeze, talent exists all right."" \n- I'd rather see more of those, than of the opposite (talented, but extremely lazy).\nOne more thing, I thank you all for taking your precious time and reading my blog.<p>p.s - my gallery, if anyone wondered whether I can really draw or not, or is interested in monitoring my progress ;)\n<a href=""http://case0thrives.deviantart.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://case0thrives.deviantart.com/</a>",1235225210

Ok, it might matter a little bit but not much and it's not as easy as saying that white uses more power than black. It might even be the other way around.<p>In an LCD the color is determined by a liquid cristal filter that can be turned on or off and dimmed. The filter itself needs hardly any power, however. Not compared to the actual light that shines through that filter.<p>The light comes from LEDs or CFLs (I guess in principle you can use any light source but those two have useful form factors and need less power than, say, incandescent lightbulbs) behind that filter. And that light is always on. Some TVs have local dimming to make the blacks blacker in certain regions of the image, but computer monitors don't.<p>So by using a dark theme, all you influence is the filter, not the actual lights. As you might know, covering up a lightbulb so you don't see it's light anymore doesn't magically make the lightbulb consume no more power.<p>AMOLED displays work differently. There the pixels themselves light up or don't. They are like a matrix of thousands of minuscule lightbulbs you can individually turn on or off.",1357904957

5042238,comment,5037089,5037646,10,0,primitur,,,"Disclaimer: I am a C programmer.<p>C is straightforward to compile on pretty much every single CPU out there.  A C compiler is required to certify many very common CPU's before they go into manufacturing, in fact.  You cannot go to silicon, in many fabs, unless you have demonstrated the CPU can handle code; most of the code doing all this testing, is in C (lots of Assembly too).  C is a front-line language, at the fabrication level.<p>- C's standard library may be sparse, but the diversity of other libraries out there means that you can do your own thing, and have complete control over what gets packed into your final binary image.  This is a given, because it is <i>powerful</i>.  A scan of /usr/lib,/usr/local/lib, or a search for .so/.dylibs in /Applications, for example, gives me, quite literally, nothing I can't like to with a C compiler.<p>-My fast edit/build/run/debug cycle goes like this: hit the hot-key in my editor, watch output, done.  Of course, I also have periods where I must sit and compile a larger collection of libraries; usually at point breaks in my development cycle, but this is all taken care of by my build server, which runs independently of development servers.  With C, I've been able to easily scale my build/release/developer binary packaging requirements from ""needs to be instant interaction between new code and running tests"" to ""needs an hour to generate keys and dependencies and be prepared for a solid few years of use"".  C's build time scales according to the productivity of the developer.<p>-C is highly productive, if you do not trip over key things.  Yes, building your own libs package should be a core part of professional C competency; no decent C developer worth their salt, who can't add a few lines of code to a multi-million-line codebase and figure out how to not sit there waiting for the kettle to boil while it builds for testing, should be allowed in any production environment.  A proper C Makefile can build entire operating systems-worth of applications; for domain-specific apps, I hardly even notice the build time any more, in between edits and updates.  C code is built so fast and integrated so well in repository/testing tools, that in my opinion the system is so well integrated its not relevant.<p>Now, if you need a prepackaged thing, and don't want to hassle with needing to know how to assume an iron grip over the dependencies issue, then of course C is a big hassle.  Other languages have their time, and place.<p>You know what else I like about C?  Lua.  With C and Lua, and a careful selection of optimal libraries, you can build a development environment beyond compare in any other realm.  The pure joy of understanding how a table-driven application goes from:<p>work_q = {} and work_q = {
  {name=""empty trash"", when=os.now(), msg=""The system trash is emptied..""},
  {name=""copy file"", when=os.now()+1000, msg=""A backup is being performed.."", cmd=""tar -cvf /mnt/backups /home/*""},
 }<p>.. to a working C-layer on multiple platforms, all functioning exactly the same way, all working from a single binary .. well then, this joy is greater than many other language/systems of development.<p>Welcome to C in the 21st Century.",1357903410

That a solution that brings different components together requires to know about the other components is obvious. It is about how the components can be designed as free standing modules without any direct dependencies. Of course, a better module system in C++ would be great and things are moving into this direction (clang already has a preliminary implementation of the modules spec).<p>It is not like the addition of templates broke C compatibility. This happened long before templates were talked about. Still, C code mostly (Yes, with tricky corners.) compiles with a C++ compiler which is great and is exactly what I would expect from a sub-set of a language. Funnily, first you complain about missing modularity due to headers and then you advocate being compatible with C, whereas exactly that feature is necessary for C compatibility.<p>As to the efficiency: You can actually know which problem you are trying to solve in generic programming by inspecting the properties of types and optimize according to those properties. See for example the different optimizations in standard libraries when it comes to optimizing copies to memcpy calls when called with appropriate types. There is certainly a lot of generic code that is quite efficient (see std::function which compares to native function calls or hand-written virtual function call operators, very fast vector implementations (llvm, facebook), std::thread).

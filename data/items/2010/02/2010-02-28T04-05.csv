I can't even think of a way to do so without making a fairly complex ETL cycle with a separate DWH and a main serving DB (with points at which the site becomes degraded and possibly unavailable). As I've mentioned earlier, with a system like Hadoop, you could start off by implementing these algorithms in Perl or Python (making use extensive libraries already available in the language).<p>Recommendations may not be real time, but there's a <i>huge</i> time difference between doing an even fairly simple ""market basket""-type analysis for a data set orders of magnitude difference smaller than Amazon's in MySQL and doing this on top of Hadoop + HBase/Voldemort/Cassandra (i.e., compute in Hadoop, serve from a NoSQL db which offers Hadoop integration). You could even start by doing the computation in Hadoop and loading the data into MySQL (while, perhaps, serving the data from a slave db).<p>> Maybe it is for Amazon which got plenty of data to analyze, but not for a startup.<p>Your start-up doesn't need to have tons of users to have tons of data. This is especially true if you're building a start-up to make sense of the data that's already out there (some YC examples are Flightcaster, Directed Edge). For a consumer start-up, ability to have cheap and scalable storage means you can record data <i>much more frequently</i>.<p>> The other problem I've had with Nosql is that capabilities vary from implementation to implementation, and my software really evolves a lot ... I don't know what my needs are from the start.<p>Isn't this the point of separating your data model from your presentation layer? Begin with MySQL (or even simpler, with BerkeleyDB) -- change it to whatever else suits your needs.",1267331331

1156410,comment,1156361,1156361,0,0,anonjon,,,"So here's a question, why don't you pick their brain back?<p>I'm intrigued with the idea of having a /conversation/ with someone over coffee and not being able to get anything in return out of them.  It is almost as if they are asking her to coffee and then interrogating her, (which doesn't seem to be a very good ebb and flow of a conversation anyway). If these  really are intelligent people, they must have something of intellectual value to offer in return.<p>If they are actually looking for a consultation, make it clear what your fees are. 
I think that that would be polite and maybe even an easy way to make some cash. 
That, or make sure that they take you out to a really nice place for dinner.<p>I would have to expect that if you were giving the advice away, and it is helpful advice, you might be able to better negotiate a favor out of the person at a later time. It might be a good idea to keep a record of these types of meetings.<p>Disclaimer: No one ever asks to pick my brain, but if I were asking to pick someone's brain, I would expect some sort of quid pro quo...",1267329837

So, why would it matter to them if alternative clients were built?  It's not as if SIP-based services were not an alternative.<p>Perhaps Skype went to all this trouble to achieve network effects?  If it was easy to block Skype traffic, maybe it would not have become the ""standard"" it is today.  The it-just-works feature was likely most critical to success, and that might only have been achieved through obfuscation.<p>So, I get the network-level obfuscation, but I don't see a case for code obfuscation.  Why should Skype care if it owns the client?  It's not like they're pushing ads upon their users or otherwise marketing too heavily.",1267329801

The dip in 1937 coincided with a FDR being pressured into balancing the budget. It's much more complicated than this, but I used the WWII reference because usu. the next best answer is WWII. Now I'm told, that WWII wasn't responsible either!? What gives?",1267329792

ECC memory is the same hardware as regular memory, you just have more of it; 4GB of ECC memory is just 7GB of regular memory with a different sticker on it.  Since most people decide how much memory to get based on the price (""I'm willing to spend $100 on memory""), demand would remain unchanged.",1267329604

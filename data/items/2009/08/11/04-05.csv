From the post:<p><i>That's why, even though I don't financially need to work, I choose to work (and end up staying up until 4am pushing new code). It's why we created FriendFeed, to have a great place to work, a place where we can build great products and have happy users. Of course I'd also like to earn a few billion dollars, and I plan to make all of our employees very wealthy, but that's more like a bonus.</i><p>Rather than undermining it, I think this underscores my point. It's precisely <i>because</i> there's more to life than money that I'm surprised he was willing to sell. I would have expected only a ~$1 billion price tag to tempt him.",1249966748

Background info really quickly: I'm 23, he's 20, and we have created a health shot from natural products that is really quite awesome (not going into too much detail here; it's not relevant. All I have to say is it's not an energy drink).<p>We plan on selling 50 ml bottles (about 2 oz) to local health markets to begin with, and see how things go from there.<p>What I want to know is this: what do I need to know about US health and food regulation before I get into this? I'm literally going to be preparing and bottling this in my kitchen for a while and selling directly to these local markets when I start out. Is there anything I should I be aware of before I start that would have the power to stop me?<p>EDIT: Starting out, it looks like I will be using these bottles: http://www.sks-bottle.com/340c/fin14e.html.

Not only in the sheer volume of data you get back, but also because so little of it is trustworthy.<p>Say I want to buy a new digital camera. I look at the Nikon D40 and wonder ""is it any good""? I Google up ""Nikon D40 reviews"" and I get a gigantic list of pages. Some are clearly spam, others clearly astroturfing for Nikon, and others look like they could be legitimate reviews... but you really don't know. Signal to noise for consumer-level research <i>really sucks</i> on Google.<p>Now take Amazon on the flip side (that I use all the time, and not just because I work there). I trust the reviews that are there - because I know that bad/good reviews are not removed or otherwise manipulated. The star rating isn't spam, isn't fake, isn't bought and paid for like millions of ""review sites"" scattered across the tubes.<p>Yes, there are ways to break Amazon's review system, but for the most part it is a trustworthy metric, and although not a <i>complete</i> replacement for in-depth research, particularly for big-ticket items, it is still extremely helpful for everyday shopping.",1249965862

With Facebook you can find out what your friends are doing, but not much else.  This is great for people who have a small and cohesive social network that largely communicates among its own members (e.g. young people.)  Twitter is more of a broadcasting platform; you can learn what your friends (and random people you follow) are eating for breakfast, but you can also get the latest news out of Iran or the most recent viral meme that everyone will be blogging about tomorrow.  Everyone seems to think ""real-time updates"" is a single category, but Twitter and Facebook each seem to be better at different facets of this info stream and I am not sure that either will make much of an inroad into the other one's turf.",1249964427

2625138,comment,2624761,2624761,40,0,adolfojp,,,"I made the following angry rant on reddit. I think that it also fits here.<p>The idea that .NET is going to be replaced by HTML5 and JavaScript is absolutely ridiculous. The only people who can make that claim are those who don't really know what .NET is. It is a desktop stack, a server stack, a runtime for many languages, those many languages themselves, and countless libraries that are being actively developed. HTML5 and JS is a minimalistic client side technology. One cannot replace the other. They are not analogous technologies.<p>The biggest changes that could happen are:<p>1. HTML5 and JS become another presentation layer for .NET apps.<p>2. HTML5 and JS get hooks to allow it to be used to write basic App Store style apps and gadgets. (Gadgets are currently written in html and js so there would be no change there.)<p>3. HTML5 and JS become another dev platform for the Windows Phone.<p>4. Silverlight gets slowly phased out.<p>That is, unless you believe that Microsoft secretly worked for 5 years to create a dev platform that is based on a technology that became popular just last year that can be used to replace every development technology like C++, .NET, etc., and that can be used to write anything from server side apps to games to database servers to operating system components. Do you really think that Microsoft is that good of a software company?<p>But of course, this is all speculation, just like all of these sensationalist articles and threads. And nothing of value can come out of this. I can't wait for the formal announcement to be made. The amount of retarded discourse that the Win 8 announcement made is absolutely depressing.",1307375978

2625136,comment,2624484,2625035,2,0,wbhart,,,"""I think it was more the implied laziness of thinking Wikipedia is a great resource but not being willing to fix it.""<p>If you spend your life teaching and doing research, laziness is not something you like to be accused of. Some of my papers and computing projects have been referenced on wikipedia. I feel my time is far better spent writing such things than entering edit wars with people who don't understand the subtleties of the subject they are writing about.<p>""As for your issue, if you know something's wrong from your own research, have you published it?""<p>I suspect you aren't an academic and I can see why you might think this would be a good course of action. You cannot publish corrections to blatant errors in Wikipedia and get academic credit for it. We are under continual pressure to publish new and interesting things. That we have found an error in Wikipedia is unfortunately not one of them.<p>""If you'd prefer, you can tell me the page and the error and I'll take care of it. Being an established editor can be handy sometimes.""<p>I suspect you'd add a note to the page asking for a citation to support the existing incorrect statement because you won't be able to check it yourself. It will remain there for months, and by then everyone will have lost interest and moved on.<p>Or perhaps the statement has a citation, but for subtle reasons the statement is correct, but nothing to do with the subject of the article. Without understanding the mathematics, you have no way of checking that. So even ""verifiability"" doesn't help.<p>You need to understand just how very difficult this is. Go to the page on ""Group action"". Look at the section ""Types of actions"". Now look at the bullet point ""irreducible"". Do you see anything wrong there? Do you see a citation? (Please do not remove it -- I am not stating there is or isn't an error there.) How would you, an experienced editor, check whether this was correct and relevant information?<p>Edit: I edited the above for tone after someone pointed out that I sounded like I was yelling. Not my intention.",1307375928

2625111,comment,2624484,2624625,1,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>if you only limited Wikipedia to people who did things ""right"", where would you be?</i><p>Although it's notionally possible that a first editor who got something ""right"" (factually correct based on reliable sources) was later reverted by someone edit-warring to score a point. Sometimes a particular edit makes Wikipedia worse rather than better. If NONE of my edits had ever been reverted (several have been), I would think that I wasn't trying hard enough to check sources and correct commonplace errors. However, it's not clear at the moment whether the editors with the lowest percentages of reverted edits are those who do the best edits, or just those whose prejudices (and topic choices) avoid scrutiny by the mob of other Wikipedia amateur editors. I am conscious of this issue because I was a professional editor and researcher to make my living long before most members of the general public had ever heard of the Internet, and because most wikipedians are so young and so devoid of editing experience that they readily mistake good edits for bad.<p><i>I think urban planners have found that neighborhood cohesion and community watches are far better than gated communities</i><p>It would be interesting to see citations to research on this issue, as well as the latest citations to research on forming online communities in which fact-checking and encouragement of careful scholarship become the group ethos. I live in a crime-free neighborhood with an annual block party and NO crime in a typical year, not gated, with good community cohesion, but also isolated from a lot of passers-by simply because it isn't a shortcut to anywhere else. Wikipedia is so exposed to the outside world, including spamming advertisers and propaganda agents of warring governments, that it may take more vigilance to protect than just an informal consensus among volunteer amateur editors.",1307375463

It failed because I created a text based social news site rather than a image based one, and because after working on it for 4 months, I couldn't look at a kitten picture without wanting to vomit.<p>Newsley.com was my second attempt.  It started out as a social news site for financial news.  I worked hard at getting an initial audience for about 6 months.  Finance types generally didn't want to talk about financial news, they want the news that's important to them, and they want it now.  So, I pivoted to turn Newsley into a financial news search engine.  That was going really well.  Traffic was (and still) doubles every 6 weeks even though it's crap, alpha and buggy as hell.<p><aside>Hackers & Founders started exploding this winter, and we had to choose either Newsley or H&F.

If you're approaching a non-geek niche (like I did for both my social news sites), you're facing an uphill battle.  That may change in a year or two as Reddit grows, but Reddit's a juggernaught right now, and it's done a great job of sub-reddit communities.<p>I firmly believe that starting (like I did) with a social news technology, is the wrong approach.

But when IExplorer 5 got released, Netscape Navigator still had over 50% market share and IExplorer 5 was the version that broke the camel's back (so to speak).<p><pre><code>     what they tried to achieve with ActiveX\n</code></pre>\nThe only thing they tried with ActiveX was IExplorer lock-in. Also at that time Java applets got really popular and ActiveX was the alternative. Suffice to say ActiveX was not working in Netscape Navigator, but 1997 was also the year Microsoft was sued by SUN for breaching the contract they had on Microsoft's alternative Java 1.1 implementation, so investing in ActiveX was a no-brainer.<p>Also, after IExplorer 6 most of the team moved to work on XAML / WPF / Silverlight, so development practically grinded to a halt. For reference IExplorer 6 got released in 2001, while IExplorer 7 in 2006 (5 years later) and it took another 4 years or so for IExplorer 8. I'm not counting IExplorer 6 SP2, which was a release intended for security fixes.<p>So basically once the war with Netscape was over, Microsoft lost interest in IExplorer and now they've picked up development again, but constantly lagging behind the competition in features and you can clearly see their bias for all things non-Microsoft - for example IExplorer 9 does not ship with WebGL, even if it is a complete spec, since that would undermine their efforts with Direct 3D and Silverlight, 2 technologies which will never be web standards.",1307373747

This is from Hadoop The Definitive Guide<p>""The problem is simple: while the storage capacities of hard drives have increased massively over the years, access speedsâ€”the rate at which data can be read from drivesâ€” have not kept up. One typical drive from 1990 could store 1370 MB of data and had a transfer speed of 4.4 MB/s,Â§ so you could read all the data from a full drive in around five minutes. Almost 20 years later one terabyte drives are the norm, but the transfer speed is around 100 MB/s, so it takes more than two and a half hours to read all the data off the disk.<p>This is a long time to read all data on a single driveâ€”and writing is even slower. The obvious way to reduce the time is to read from multiple disks at once. Imagine if we had 100 drives, each holding one hundredth of the data. Working in parallel, we could read the data in under two minutes.\nOnly using one hundredth of a disk may seem wasteful. But we can store one hundred datasets, each of which is one terabyte, and provide shared access to them. We can imagine that the users of such a system would be happy to share access in return for shorter analysis times, and, statistically, that their analysis jobs would be likely to be spread over time, so they wouldnâ€™t interfere with each other too much.""",1307373218

2624954,comment,2624484,2624786,2,0,wbhart,,,"It's not as easy as you say. When the article contains mathematical errors, sourcing your correction is not easy. Wikipedia does not allow personal research. When the article contains ""facts"" which are in error, which you only know because you can understand the maths yourself, you don't have a source, other than your own research. Finding one, to correct what is to you a blatant error, can be a massive job. You shouldn't need a source to correct an error. The person who wrote the original piece of incorrect information should have to source <i>their</i> claim.<p>Also, when I edit wikipedia articles without consultation with the community first, it invariably gets shouted at and reverted. Consult the community, and you have to expect that people there actually understand why the article is in error. Mathematics is sometimes very subtle. Errors can be subtle. Trying to explain them to people who didn't understand what they were writing in the first place is impossible.<p>Yes, there are very many extremely qualified academics adding stuff to Wikipedia. But there are also very many amateur mathematicians who write many almost-but-not-quite-true things, not understanding the subtleties involved.<p>I already spend a lot of my time teaching people how to do mathematics. Doing so on Wikipedia is a poor venue.<p>By the way, since when did people start using the down voting feature on HN for posts they didn't personally agree with?",1307372923

A$50 locally (I still lived in Australia then) and I could buy it for like A$35-40 <i>delivered</i> from the UK.<p>What's weird is the physical media just installed the Steam game. So I don't get why it was so expensive on Steam.<p>It does seem Steam's content distribution is somewhat complicated. Like Telstra has their own Steam server so will distribute Steam content to BigPond customers and possibly broader than that. So they'll no doubt get a cut for that. Steam will take a cut. But for physical media the retailer takes a huge cut. So why so expensive digitally?",1307372880

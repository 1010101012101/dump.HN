8398057,comment,8393890,8395999,1,0,RyanGWU82,,,"I was pretty unhappy with how Rackspace handled the maintenance window.<p>1. Rackspace&#x27;s maintenance announcement was sent at 9:00 PM on Friday night (Pacific time). Seriously?! I had already left for a weekend vacation without my laptop, so I couldn&#x27;t do anything to get my company prepared. Even if the patch wasn&#x27;t ready until Friday night, Rackspace could have scheduled the maintenance windows and announced them to customers much earlier.<p>2. The maintenance window for all three USA regions were scheduled at the same time. We couldn&#x27;t just move to a different region without going to another continent.<p>3. Each maintenance window was 24 hours -- that&#x27;s just too long. Even though our servers were only down for 10 minutes, we had to be on call and ready for 24 hours.<p>4. Although we have redundant servers in every region, we still couldn&#x27;t guarantee that those redundant servers wouldn&#x27;t be rebooted at the same time. As it turns out, we did lose both of our servers in ORD at the same time.",1412200735

It&#x27;s stunningly simple<p>Yes, but is it <i>true</i>?<p>There are plenty of platitudes that are &quot;fastastic&quot; and &quot;simple,&quot; but aren&#x27;t <i>true</i>.  Maybe you get comfort from believing things even if they&#x27;re not actually true, but I really deeply do not.<p>> Why not tell people to try really hard at whatever they&#x27;d like to be good at? What&#x27;s the alternative... don&#x27;t try hard, because there&#x27;s a small chance you won&#x27;t get good at it despite your best efforts?<p>Did you read my comment?  I am arguing that if someone really wants to feel the satisfaction of success, they should become deeply acquainted with their talents, because pursuing things you are <i>talented</i> at gives you by far the best chance of success.<p>I always wished I was better at drawing.  I&#x27;ve put in some concerted effort at it multiple times (like not a ton, but enough to realize that I am frustratingly non-talented at it).  If my parents had truly made me believe the 10k hour rule, I might still be trying to make that happen instead of following my true talents, which I&#x27;ve achieved a pretty high level of achievement at.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you should steer kids away from things they are interested in, or tell them they can&#x27;t succeed.  I&#x27;m just saying: help them to know themselves, and don&#x27;t plant in them the idea that 10k hours will magically make them awesome at anything.",1412200707

8398033,comment,8396637,8397811,5,0,TeMPOraL,,,"> <i>this is the kind of shallow giving that doesn&#x27;t create lasting change. I believe true impact comes not just from dollars but people having their hearts invested in causes they believe in.</i><p>I don&#x27;t really agree with this. Whether or not this &quot;shallow giving&quot; creates a lasting change depends on what DaD does with the money.<p>It&#x27;s true that &quot;people having their hearts invested in causes they believe in&quot; can have an enormous impact <i>when they act on their feelings</i>. E.g. I care deeply about the current spread of Ebola, or the war that is raging 350 kilometers from my home, but since I&#x27;m doing exactly nothing about any of this, my state of heart has absolutely zero impact on anything.<p>You said &quot;the chance that you help create lasting change and a shift in thinking about yourself versus others is unlikely&quot;, but I believe it is important to explicitly separate those two concerns. When one considers donating to charity, one can have multiple reasons for that (usually at the same timie) - like a) &quot;creating lasting change&quot;, and b) &quot;shift in thinking about yourself&quot;. And maybe c) &quot;positive emotions from helping people&quot;. All those reasons are good, but I endorse the idea that one should consider and maximize them separately, or in other words &quot;purchase fuzzies and utilons separately&quot;[0]. The post I linked is a very good take on this topic.<p>Dollar a Day is not a good way to optimize for a). There are definitely more effective charities out there. It can be an decent way to c) purchase fuzzy feelings cheaply, especially for those who don&#x27;t have much experience donating or helping people in general. As for b), I think it might have a good enough effect given how strong the human need to stay internally consistent is. You find yourself spending money on charity, therefore you start thinking about yourself as a kind of person that donates to good causes.<p>> <i>If you&#x27;re willing to trust Dollar A Day to spread your money to charities, why not just cut out the middle-man and find one charity you trust and believe in to give to?</i><p>That was the point of my comment. Between people who don&#x27;t give to charity at all and people who are willing to &quot;cut out the middle-man&quot; there will always be a group who would give if someone handled the cognitive burden for them. By reducing the process to just subscribing somewhere, Dollar a Day has an opportunity to capture this group, and thus increase amount of money that is given to charities.<p>So TL;DR: if you think this idea is too cheap a charity for your taste, you&#x27;re probably not the target audience - you already are willing to be more effective at donating. So give to whom you think you should, and let DaD guys help capture people who otherwise wouldn&#x27;t donate at all.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/6z/purchase_fuzzies_and_utilons_separately/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/6z/purchase_fuzzies_and_utilons_sepa...</a>",1412200493

8398030,comment,8396129,8397583,4,0,tzs,,,"Here is a longer, more detailed article on the Polgar experiment [1].<p>Unfortunately, since the Polgar sisters were all full siblings, it is possible that they were born geniuses, not made geniuses. Laszlo Polgar wanted to try the experiment again, this time with three boys adopted from a developing nation, but his wife talked him out of it.<p>For the sake of argument, let&#x27;s assume that many or most kids would, if given the Polgar treatment in a field become world class in that field. Then an important and interesting question is how early do you have to start? The Polgars started at 4.<p>The problem I see with starting that young is that it is before the child has a chance to figure out what they are interested in. If you can wait until the child has developed definite interests, and then give the Polgar treatment in one of those, you might have a better chance of the child actually sticking with that as a career.<p>That&#x27;s kind of how it was with Carlsen. His parents did not thrust it upon him. He was taught the game at 5, and showed little interest in it. Later, he developed an interest on his own, studied on his own, and started doing well. His parents then provided good support so that he could develop that interest.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200506/the-grandmaster-experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200506/the-grandmast...</a>",1412200461

That is, collecting money via creditcard AND getting that money to a local NGO in Mali is not going to be cheap.<p>But regardless, 4% does sound like a lot, especially if they disburse to e.g. US based organisations that work abroad.<p>If the bitcoin ecosystem matures it&#x27;d be able to help a huge deal in this regard. Circle just launched offering free and instant purchase using bank or credit, and Bitpay offers 0% payment processing in 33 countries.<p>Anyway, I hope people consider checking out the give well foundation. Giving well is extremely important, and I&#x27;m concerned that getting a daily email with some organisations, without any data, analysis etc, we&#x27;ll be giving very ineffectively to the guys with the most magical story, and perhaps, to the guys with the most money spent on marketing vs aid. Now I definitely am of the opinion that this is okay (great Ted talk on this), BUT if you could spend better, I&#x27;d encourage that.<p>The best example for me was this. Millions of people worldwide are blind due to cataracts, often due to malnutrition. You can largely and often completely &#x27;cure&#x27; these people from their blindness with a cheap $20 operation that commonly happens in countries like India. Alternatively, you have blind people who can&#x27;t be cured, often born blind. We can improve their quality of life, but in say the US it&#x27;d cost $20k to completely raise, nurture and train a guide dog.<p>So we have a choice to either cure someone&#x27;s blindness completely, or literally spend three orders of magnitude (1000x) more to improve a blind person&#x27;s life.<p>As you can imagine, getting one million donors to drop $20 would be a hugely successful campaign. But if they all spent it on guide dogs, it&#x27;d have much less of an impact of merely 1000 people donating $20 to completely cure the blindness of a similar number of people.<p>That&#x27;s why giving well is so important. I fear apps and services like these diminish that. I hope we all appreciate our influence and act accordingly by carefully considering who to give your money to.",1412200436

Generically concluding that people cannot help themselves by trying harder is crazy. Sure, there are specific cases but this conclusion is generic and therefore incorrect.<p>It seems that either I or the author really misunderstand this 10,000 rule. My understanding was always that I cannot truly master something without 10,000 hours of practice. This is very, VERY different than saying I can master anything with 10,000 hours.

Online ad revenues aren&#x27;t going to equal those for print, simply because there is so much more visibility into targeting, reach and conversions. Thus, advertisers have a much better idea of the value of an impression/click, and can price accordingly, rather than indiscriminately shot-gunning eyeballs as in print.<p>Entrenched cost structures contribute to the problem, but the fact is that paying a professional staff to produce quality content every day costs a lot of money, and online there are fewer dollars coming in per reader, even if the total audience is much larger. The exception to this downward trend is if you have content catering to highly lucrative niches such as insurance or banking (although I don&#x27;t know how these compare to similarly placed print ads).<p>Premium video has a similar problem; advertising revenue is unsustainable for anything other than indie YouTube shows.

8397954,comment,8396129,8397805,4,0,selmnoo,,,"10,000 hour rule is a rule of thumb, a saying, and a wonderfully fantastic one at that. It&#x27;s stunningly simple, I think that&#x27;s what makes it so compelling. It&#x27;s basically the phrase &quot;practice makes perfect&quot; modernized. Of course it&#x27;s not 100% true, but for most people it&#x27;s excellent advice. The advice is basically &quot;keep practicing, keep pushing yourself, seek good instruction, try to get feedback from people who know what they&#x27;re doing&quot;.<p>My argument is that 10,000 hour rule has become the &quot;practice makes perfect&quot; of today. Just like a lot of sayings passed down from generation to generation it&#x27;s not 100% true, but to nitpick it is beyond useless, it&#x27;s harmful. Why <i>not</i> tell people to try really hard at whatever they&#x27;d like to be good at? What&#x27;s the alternative... don&#x27;t try hard, because there&#x27;s a small chance you won&#x27;t get good at it despite your best efforts? That&#x27;s senseless. I&#x27;m sorry, I think your criticism is harmful. 10,000 hour rule as it is exchanged today between people, in the kind of Gladwell narrative (which may not be scientifically valid 100%), is advice that&#x27;s easy to internalize, and motivates people to try hard really well. I hate to see it being shot down by this kind of bikeshedding. Because apparently, at least to me, the only other alternative is gutless, feckless defeatist, overly-cautious &quot;be warned that even if you try, you&#x27;re not going to succeed&quot;.

One of the main points is that to practice effectively, do not waste your time playing pieces over and over again. A 50 bar piece might contain only one bar that gives you trouble. If you play the piece over and over again, you will only encounter that bar 1 in 50 times. If you just play that bar, you will be practicing the difficult part nearly 50X faster.<p>You can use a metronome to identify &quot;stress points&quot;. These show up when you gradually increase tempo. Perhaps at 80 beats per minute, you can get through the piece, but around 95 b.p.m. there are places where you start to fumble. Those are the stress points to focus on.<p>Another fascinating observation or insight of the author is about speed. You can play a run of several notes infinitely fast with ease: namely, just strike them at the same time as a chord. There, infinitely fast!  So it&#x27;s actually the in-between speeds that are troublesome; it&#x27;s not true that difficulty strictly increases with speed.<p>In fact, insanely fast phrases are actually played as chords, with staggered timing. The hand comes down to play all the notes, but they are offset so they start at different times.<p>He regards this backwards: start at infinite speed (playing the chord) and then it&#x27;s just a matter of slowing it down from there: stagger the notes so they sound individually.<p>Pure genius!",1412199367

8397900,comment,8396375,8397781,22,0,tjradcliffe,,,"It is always very dangerous and misleading to argue about abstract categories as if they were real things outside of the minds that make them. &quot;Addiction&quot; the label we use for a category we impose on the objective reality we observe. The OP is questioning the utility of that categorization based on more extensive observation of that objective reality.<p>In particular: there is evidence that the population we now group into the category &quot;addicts&quot; may in fact include two sub-populations, one of which &quot;ages out&quot;, one of which does not. We currently have a &quot;lumped model&quot; of addiction, which associates certain additional features with the phenomenology we use to assign something to the category.<p>For example, if we find a person who is a chronic user whose use is negatively impacting their lives and who seems unable to stop, we are going to label that person an &quot;addict&quot;. But the members of that category also get assigned other attributes for free. In particular, the current model of &quot;addiction is a disease&quot; says that anyone who fits the external phenomenology is also never going to get better without &quot;treatment&quot;, or at best is very unlikely to do so.<p>But that association of &quot;uncontrolled harmful use&quot; and &quot;its a disease&quot; is a purely theoretical construct that may be wrong.<p>For comparison: I once worked on the genetics of a particular type of cancer that had two very distinct outcomes but which presented identically in a clinical setting. A physician I worked with described it as being incredibly frustrating, because she could literally see two patients in the same day who were apparently in the same condition based on histology, stage of the disease, everything, but ten years later one would be watching his daughter graduating from high-school and the other would have been dead for nine years. Simply because the diseases <i>looked the same by some measures</i> did not mean they <i>were the same thing</i>.<p>So it could well be that the same external phenomenology is present in two quite different conditions. It would be extremely silly to argue that one is &quot;really&quot; addiction and other is not, because &quot;addiction&quot; is just an abstract category we created to subsume different instances of similar phenomenology. We could call one grue and the other bleen, for all the difference it would make.<p>The possibility of two quite different underlying conditions presenting similar symptoms is one that has been realized often enough to be worth taking seriously, and when it occurs in things like the cancer described above <i>no one ever makes the argument &#x27;well X sounds like it is really cancer type Y to me&#x27;</i>. Yet when the question of addiction comes up, many people say precisely that, and I am at a loss to understand why.",1412199207
8397899,comment,8396375,8397578,4,0,skinnybatch,,,"Heart attack, respiratory failure, and other organ failure to boot. \nTthe math of determining these &quot;average&quot; lengths of addiction are also troubling. When accounting for individuals that may have been addicted for three years, but died at the end of those three years, are we factoring in 3 years as the length of addiction? Are we weighting it in some other way along a point scale? The very title of that statistic is troublesome too: the length of addiction - it is unclear as to whether the lengths being measured and averaged share the same initial and final endpoints: The length of time elapsed between having no drug problem and recovery? Or, having no drug problem and death? Or, as I suspect a combined average, which renders the statistic useless.<p>I find troublesome that the author of the article (renowned neuroscientist and addiction journalist as cited) suggests that addiction is akin to a habit. The behavior itself is certainly habit, but the addiction lies moreso in the etymology and function of the habit than the actual repetitive behavior. For some, the addiction is distraction, for some escape, for others a sense of identity, and so on and so forth. To prescribe &quot;outgrowing the addiction&quot; as a solution is awfully simplistic, almost suggesting that if an addict could only replace that habit with something else, then all would be hunky dory. Well, in theory, sure. Maybe we can start designing rehab centers like they used to do traffic school - Improv Traffic School, Comedy Traffic School, Bikers&#x27; Traffic School - maybe Knitters Rehab: &quot;We&#x27;ll help you put down that needle, and pick up this one!&quot; or Foodies Rehab: &quot;Stop smoking that joint, and learn to smoke these ribs!&quot; The possibilities are endless.

8397889,comment,8396090,8396090,28,0,jasode,,,"Some comments here express some head scratching on what exactly Sway is.  I only saw the demo video like everyone else so I don&#x27;t claim to know definitively but here&#x27;s my take on where Sway fits.<p>It looks like we&#x27;re in a general upward trend of <i>richer interactive documents</i> created by <i>average users</i>.<p>Some observations of the zeitgiest that look unrelated on the surface but nevertheless, seems to point towards a common desire for dynamic user-controlled &quot;documents&quot;:<p>-- Javascript d3.js embedded in stories, blog articles, etc that engages readers to &quot;play&quot; with data (Mike Bostock is a good example of interactive pictures for New York Times) [1],[2]<p>-- Mathematica CDF (Computable Document Format) with things like sliders, etc to let the user control how the data changes[3]<p>-- Bret Victor&#x27;s various demonstrations for dynamic content [4]<p>-- many more examples, etc. I cant remember but play on this theme<p>Right now, there isn&#x27;t an interactive document format (or interactive content creation tool) that dominates the way Microsoft PowerPoint dominates for the old-style static stuff.<p>If one has the skills, one can write d3.js type presentations but obviously, the typical PowerPoint jock isn&#x27;t not going to learn javascript like Mike Bostock.<p>Before d3.js, if I personally wanted to write any interactive charts for presentation and <i>embed that interactivity inside a document</i> that managers could review offline, I&#x27;d create an Excel spreadsheet + add some GUI slider controls + add some Visual Basic code to react to sliders to update the spreadsheet.[5]  Unfortunately, any xls (xlsm) file with a macro throws up all sorts of scary security warnings when a user open the xls file.  It&#x27;s just very clunky to share this type of doc.<p>It&#x27;s hard to tell from the demo, but it seems like Sway is also a tool to author content intended for <i>non-linear</i> exploration.  (Whereas PowerPoint or MS Word docs are consumed in <i>linear</i> fashion ... PgDn, Pgdn, etc).  Therefore, some of its features would overlap with an eLearning-creation tool like Adobe Captivate[6].<p>In short, I believe the market is trying to sort out how to empower <i>averager users</i> to make dynamic presentation content.  The d3.js, the Excel macros, the Mathematica CDF, etc are tools that are too specialized and meant for experts.  This is why the demo commercial emphasized a young child creating materials instead of an adult programming expert.  It&#x27;s the &quot;<i>so easy a child could do it</i>&quot; type of narrative.<p>I can&#x27;t tell from the demo if the content created would be 100% cloud stored and delivered.  I would think that Sway would also have the capability to create self-contained document files.  I can think of big customer like the USA government not using it if it&#x27;s cloud only.  The government loves their Powerpoint presentations.  The government also has tons of locked down computers without internet access that share Powerpoints so a 100% cloud-Sway product would be a no-go.<p>EDIT ADD:  after looking at sway website again, I finally noticed that they have 6 example Sway presentations (&quot;Sways we love&quot;).  None of those examples have any interactive data features that I could detect.  On the other hand, the video @ 34 secs shows the woman manipulating a chart.  The 6 example docs are not that impressive; they just look like a bunch of jquery sliding animations instead of representing the dynamics I see in the video.  Maybe I&#x27;m overestimating what Sway actually can do.  If it&#x27;s just a program with a bunch of themes for sliding animations and adjustable grids that resize to desktop or mobile screens, that would be a huge disappointment.<p>[1]<a href=""http://bost.ocks.org/mike/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bost.ocks.org/mike/</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/language/howto/CreateAComputableDocumentFormatFile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.wolfram.com/language/howto/CreateAComputabl...</a><p>[4]<a href=""http://worrydream.com/#!/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/#!/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable</a><p>[5]<a href=""http://chandoo.org/wp/2013/08/06/how-to-create-a-then-vs-now-interactive-chart-in-excel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chandoo.org/wp/2013/08/06/how-to-create-a-then-vs-now...</a><p>[6]<a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate.html</a>",1412199117

I&#x27;ve been working as a consultant since 1995.  I have extensive experience with Ruby (and Rails), Python, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and many other technologies.  I have a PhD in Learning Sciences from Northwestern University; I researched the intersection between online communities, collaboration, social networks, and agent-based models.<p>My real value isn&#x27;t my extensive technological know-how.  Rather, it&#x27;s my ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical people, and to turn that communication into business value.<p>I know how to take business needs and turn them into software, by myself and with others.  I also know how to describe technical issues in terms that business people can understand, that allow us to make informed decisions.  Many of my clients have used me as a remote, part-time CTO or lead developer.<p>I also help developers and teams improve their coding and management practices.  I frequently teach in-person courses in Python, Ruby/Rails, PostgreSQL, and Git to such companies as Apple, Cisco, Freescale, HP, SANDisk, and VMWare.  I also offer online coaching/pairing services to individuals and teams.  I can be your &quot;personal coding trainer,&quot; setting goals and meeting several times each week to ensure that your code and coding improve.<p>My aim: Long-term, interesting projects with nice people.  (Short-term relationships can also be fine, depending on the work and myschedule.)  Bottom line, I like to speak with and help nice people, and feel privileged that my work lets me do so.  If I can incorporate elements of what I learned doing my PhD -- an online collaborative platform and social network for agent-based modelers (<a href=""http://modelingcommons.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modelingcommons.org/</a>) -- then that would delight me even more.<p>If I can be of help to you or your company, contact me at reuven@lerner.co.il, or on Skype as &quot;reuvenlerner&quot;.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, being able to raise money for charities (assuming it&#x27;s a good cause) is undoubtably a good thing, and will have a positive impact, but this is the kind of shallow giving that doesn&#x27;t create lasting change. I believe true impact comes not just from dollars but people having their hearts invested in causes they believe in.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to trust Dollar A Day to spread your money to charities, why not just cut out the middle-man and find one charity you trust and believe in to give to?",1412198428

To me, there are few things more grating than pop science that isn&#x27;t true, but gets repeated because it sounds good.<p>And the &quot;10,000 hour rule&quot; is worse than just a trivial factoid.  It is a recipe for disappointment.  If you tell someone that, despite their initial lack of talent, they can be &quot;superb&quot; at anything they want, and 10,000 hours later they are still mediocre at best, don&#x27;t you think it would be frustrating to have wasted that much time?<p>I want people to dream, but also to know themselves and to be able to perceive the difference between what comes easily and what doesn&#x27;t.

When she was five she defeated a family friend at chess without looking at the board.  I doubt she had practiced 10,000 hours by then, or that most five year olds with a comparable level of instruction could have done that.  Actually I would seriously wager that even with 10,000 hours of practice I would not be capable of doing what she did at 5.",1412198360

That is definitely minimizing addiction.<p>A perfectly reasonable counter to his arguments is the possibility that the data isn&#x27;t terribly accurate. The data concerning people &quot;classified as addicts&quot; vs the hypothetical set of data for &quot;actual addicts&quot; might look very different (could we actually obtain this). The problem of classifying addicts or even really defining the term is very open as of now. Using datasets for addicts with the same confidence as datasets concerning those suffering from breast cancer for instance is foolish. The gray area as to whether someone does or does not have breast cancer is very small when compared to that same gray area with addiction.<p>My own experience shows that there are addicts who never get better, progressively get worse and tend to die very sad deaths. My family is riddled with this type of addict. The possibility that the author is not suffering from the exact same condition that my family members are afflicted with is not really considered. He spends one or two sentences describing how bad his addiction was as proof to the contrary but this is just shirking the real issue of identification. So yes, I think through the author&#x27;s narrow-minded approach they are indeed treading dangerously on minimizing addiction and the &quot;negative impact of drugs.&quot;",1412197957

Mostly STEM, some business and law courses.<p>My UK experience is pretty much in line with the above summary from my college life between 1986 and 1995. Lots of blackboard lectures, practical coursework where necessary, one, occasionally two exams per subject. Coursework grades determined whether you would be permitted to sit your exams. Broad spectrum of skill and knowledge levels at the start of the course, very even distribution towards the end. You either figured it out, or you failed.<p>My US experience was more like school, lots of handholding, lots of silly child-like exercises, broad spectrum of skill levels and knowledge at the beginning and it remained so right through to the end. Lots more negotation between students and professor about assignments and when they are due, and skirting the rules, especially on the business courses for an MBA I was enrolled in. The pace on the MBA could be described as &quot;plodding&quot; at best.<p>This is also my ancedotal experience and also probably not universal.",1412197817
8397747,comment,8394381,8395751,1,0,jamii,,,"> Is it planned that users of Eve will routinely construct new or modify existing domain-specific editors to the task at hand?<p>Not sure at this point. For now we are focusing on the core interactions and we&#x27;ll build out the rest once we&#x27;ve put tools in peoples hands and seen how they work.<p>> What domain-specific editors are you planning to include in public release? Something for UI construction on the web?<p>The table, rule and function editors for managing data and logic. A UI editor, hopefully with some constraint-based layout model. Various debugging/tracing/understanding tools.<p>> Since first focus of Eve is on web apps (and it&#x27;s hosted on javascript, correct?), will it cover both client and server applications?<p>It will have to. Not sure yet how that will work. We can do websocket-style stuff at the moment but we will want to provide something simpler on top of that.<p>> Will there be an FFI?<p>Yes. You will be able to add new functions / datatypes (like <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/xtypes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/xtypes.html</a>), new table/index data-structures (like <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/gist-intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/gist-intro.html</a>) and new query-plan/data-flow nodes.<p>The editor and compiler are mostly written in Eve. The core language is tiny but very extensible - since execution order is not specified explicitly but determined from data-flow you can drop new logic in anywhere to add new compiler optimisations or new editor commands.<p>The language is also very data-centric - this week I was playing with programs that modify their own code by writing to the ast tables, triggering the incremental compiler to update the dataflow plan.<p>> If I remember correctly, you&#x27;re planning to use datalog+time+constraints and plan to use materialized views extensively, is it so? Will ability to work with changes as a stream and aggregate over them in more interesting ways than &quot;the last always wins&quot; be builtin in Eve?<p>We&#x27;re still trying out different models of time. The ideal semantic model is append-only, never forget. Implementing that on a real machine needs some restrictions to prevent exploding. Dedalus (<a href=""http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/datalog2011-dedalus.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/datalog2011-dedalus.pdf</a>) attaches epochs to each facts and only allows rules to query the current or last epoch. Edelweiss (<a href=""http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/vldb14-edelweiss.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/vldb14-edelweiss.pdf</a>) allows querying any epoch but uses static analysis to figure out when data can be safely deleted without changing the results.<p>> Have you tried to show a prototype to children and how do they respond in learning such system if so? What was the reaction of academic friends who were not too familiar with standard forms of programming (like you did with the first prototype of Aurora)?<p>No children yet. We test things on adult non-programmers regularly. That lead to a couple of surprising changes like getting rid of nesting / scoping (no matter what we did visually, people just couldn&#x27;t figure it out).<p>> If I&#x27;ll ask more questions will it be all right and not too much trouble? :)<p>Keep &#x27;em coming.",1412197812

So I was generally having either mudslides at Applebee&#x27;s or Kahlua Cappuccino at Red Lobster (often with an extra shot -- two drinks with an extra shot each is four shots of alcohol).<p>According to Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahl%C3%BAa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahl%C3%BAa</a>:<p><i>Since 2004, the alcohol content of Kahlúa is 20.0% (21.5% alc. is still available only in Ohio[citation needed]); earlier versions had 26.5%.</i><p>This would have been around 2001-2002 in California. So, you should use the 26.5% figure. I don&#x27;t know what a &quot;shot&quot; is considered to be. I mean as a standard measure. I assume there is a standard measure of &quot;shot&quot; though. So what would 2-4 shots of Kahlua a day be? Is that &quot;alcoholic&quot;?<p>Just curious. I never thought of myself as an alcoholic. I was clear I did this because it knocked back the extreme physical pain I was in at a time when pain killers did little or nothing for me and doctors weren&#x27;t being especially helpful. I just wanted to hurt less and I wanted to SLEEP. So, I would have a drink with dinner or before bedtime, because nothing else was doing a helluva lot for me.",1412197251

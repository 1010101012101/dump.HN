8574064,comment,8572126,8572126,0,0,bmmayer1,,,"This is basically a perfect example of how &quot;capitalism&quot; in the US is not capitalism anymore. No corporation should be insulated from the financial downside of its incompetence. In the real world, Chase should have gone under or at least lost a hundred billion in market cap, but instead they are in cahoots with government regulators to limit their downside and protect their upside from what is their fault.<p>This is not capitalism! And it&#x27;s painful to see how this hybrid growth-corporatist model trump true innovation and economic progress. It&#x27;s an insult to free market economics and  democracy at the same time.<p>Rant over. One addendum: jail time isn&#x27;t the answer. Putting an executive in a minimum security prison for 5 years just lets another one take his place. CEOs aren&#x27;t afraid of jail time, they&#x27;re afraid of losing money. If you let banks <i>fail</i> who deserve it then creative destruction will ensure stronger, better and safer banks in the future.

These two ideas may well have some truth to them, but neither are guaranteed.<p>Frankly, it&#x27;s strange to me that in a society in which we are constantly exposed to the memoirs, memories, junkets, and essays of the roundly accomplished, we still think they are any happier than anyone else. Surely some must be or must have been, but I don&#x27;t know of any confessors. I have heard plenty admit to dissatisfaction, to put it mildly. I hope you don&#x27;t run into the same trap that many do.<p>The only thing I agree with you on is that I, too, am a misanthrope in even some of my best hours. I just don&#x27;t think any more highly of myself for the fact.<p>Still, I would be proud to have made a better world for the people I do care about--and would even be happy with this George Eliot line for an epitaph, although the pronouns don&#x27;t map quite right:<p><i>&quot;But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.&quot;</i>",1415386585

What&#x27;s more, to defray the cost of this and other fines, Chase last year laid off 7,500 lower-level employees. Meanwhile, per-employee compensation for everyone else rose four percent, to $122,653. But no one made out better than Dimon.

So the pseudo assembly for thread 0 might become:<p><pre><code>    > store(zeroWants, 1)\n    > store(victim, 0)\n    > r0 = load(victim) ; NEW DUMMY INSTRUCTION\n    > r0 = load(oneWants)\n    > r1 = load(victim)</code></pre>\n> Since the dummy instruction is a load, the X86 can’t reorder the other loads before it. Also, since it loads from “victim”, the X86 can’t move it before the store to “victim”.<p>> If you do this to both threads, does that solve the problem?<p>This doesn&#x27;t work. Intel specifically calls out these sorts of attempts to get a fake memory barrier: &quot;The memory-ordering model allows concurrent stores by two processors to be seen in different orders by those two processors; specifically, each processor may perceive its own store occurring before that of the other.&quot; This is true in practice as well as in theory.<p>A related trick that <i>does</i> work in practice (though it is also banned by Intel) is to write to the low-order bytes of a word, read the entire word, and get the high-order bytes. It&#x27;s sort of a single-word StoreLoad barrier.

It&#x27;s a global DHT acting as a content-addressible store, where there&#x27;s no &quot;direct me to X&quot; protocol function, only a &quot;proxy my request for X to whoever you suspect has X, and cache X for yourself when returning it to me&quot; function.<p>(Aside: Freenet <i>also</i> does Tor-like onion-routing stuff between the DHT nodes, which makes it <i>extremely</i> slow to the point that it was discarded by most as a solution for anonymous mesh-networking. But it doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to do that. &quot;Caching forwarding-proxy DHT&quot; and &quot;encrypted onion-routing message transport&quot; are completely orthogonal ideas, which <i>could</i> be stacked, or used separately, on a case by case basis. &quot;Caching forward-proxying DHT&quot; is to the IP layer as &quot;encrypted onion-routing message transport&quot; is to TLS. PersistentTor-over-PlaintextFreenet would be much better than either Tor or Freenet as they are today.)<p>I agree that this could totally be done as a library in pretty much any language that allows for runtime module loading or runtime code evaluation. And, like you say, there are tons of interesting corollaries.<p>I think, though, that to be truly useful, you have to push this sort of idea as low in the stack as possible.<p>Unix established the &quot;file descriptor&quot; metaphor: a seekable stream of blocks-of-octets, some of which (files) existed persistently on disk, some of which (pipes) existed ephemerally between processes and only required resources proportional to the unconsumed buffer, some of which (sockets) existed between processes on entirely separate hosts. Everything in Unix is a file. (Or could be, at least. Unix programmers get &quot;expose this as a file descriptor&quot; right at about the same rate web API designers get REST right.) Unix (and most descendants) are &quot;built on&quot; files.<p>To truly expose the power of a global code-sharing system, you&#x27;d need the OS to be &quot;built on&quot; global-DHT-dereferenceable URNs. There would be cryptographic hashes everywhere in the system-call API. Because your data likely wouldn&#x27;t just be <i>on</i> your computer (just cached there), you&#x27;d see cryptographic signatures instead of ownership, and encryption where a regular OS would use ACL-based policies.<p>At about the same level of importance that Unix treats &quot;directories&quot;, such an OS would have to treat the concept of a data equivalence-mapping manifests (telling you how to get git objects from packfiles, a movie from a list of torrent chunk hashes, etc.)<p>For any sort of collaborative manipulation of shared state, you&#x27;d probably see blocks from little private cryptocurrency block-chains floating about in the DHT, where the &quot;currency&quot; just represents CPU cycles the nodes are willing to donate to one-another&#x27;s work.<p>And then (like in Plan9&#x27;s Fossil), you might see regular filesystems and such built on top of this. But they&#x27;d only be metaphors—your files would be &quot;on&quot; your disk to about the same degree that a process&#x27;s stack is &quot;in&quot; L1 cache. Disks would really just be another layer of the memory hierarchy, entirely page-cache; and marking a memory page &quot;required to be persisted&quot; would shove it out to the DHT, not to disk, since your disk isn&#x27;t highly available.<p>—<i>but</i>. Designing this as an OS for PCs would be silly. It would have much too far to go to catch up with things like Windows and OSX. Much better to design it to run in userspace, or as a Xen image, or on a rump kernel on server hardware somewhere. It&#x27;d be an OS for cloud computers, or to be emulated in a background service on a PC and spoken with over a socket, silently installed as a dependency by some shiny new GUI app.<p>Which is, of course, the niches Erlang already fits into.

I even try to force myself to be mindful while checking my email by dealing with a single email at a time (thanks to Mailbox app), and consciously delegating emails and tasks to a particular time if I&#x27;m unable to deal with it immediately. In my experience, multitasking is a sleep depriving, mentally taxing, stress inducing, debilitating activity which only reduces quality of life from every conceivable angle, and hurts productivity in general.<p>It all boils down to one thing: have a single conscious intention when doing something.

More commonly done with higher-level languages rather than machine code, but certainly possible with machine code.  A good fuzzer could do this too.<p>The fuzzer from the article, american-fuzzy-lop (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop/</a>), does something similar to this as it moves forward in execution, trying to find interesting inputs that cause the program to take a different code path.  Symbolic execution could accelerate that process, allowing afl to immediately identify the relevant things to fuzz, rather than randomly mutating and looking for interestingness.  On the other hand, unless the program in question runs very slowly, or uses many complex compound instructions before a single conditional branch, random mutation seems likely to produce results rapidly from sheer speed.<p>Symbolic execution does seem like it would work well if you want to reach a specific point in the program, and you have rather complex conditionals required to get there.  But it would still have trouble with complex cases.  Consider a file format with a SHA256 hash in it, where the header must have a valid hash to parse.  Symbolic execution would have a very hard time figuring out the input relationship required to get past that hash check.",1415385068

When a synchronised block of encrypted traffic turns up at a host, there&#x27;s your probable cause to go image the server: it&#x27;s practically bulletproof evidence that the hidden service corresponding to some black market is running on that machine.<p>The only bottleneck to this approach is finding the datacenters, but there aren&#x27;t that many which accept Bitcoin for payment, and I bet intelligence agencies can easily provide a list of every colocation facility that is running long term connections to the Tor network.

There is absolutely a place for an API like this -- but that place is not as a replacement for OpenSSL.<p>The world has changed.  We must now consider send(2) and recv(2) to be toxic.  They are fundamentally broken and cannot be used safely.  The problem is, what do we use in their place?  Simple sockets should continue to be simple to use, even now that we need to layer encryption on top.  OpenSSL is not a practical replacement for those functions.  This new API is a pretty good attempt.  It may not do everything that OpenSSL does, but it doesn&#x27;t need to.  It only needs to make the simple things easy.  If you have a different use case, you should use a different high-level API.<p>I think the way to understand this API is to see it as a &quot;view&quot;, a wrapper, an abstraction.  It&#x27;s like a database view that hides the dozen tricky joins necessary to answer a frequently asked question.  Also, like a database view, it is one of potentially many, each with a different purpose.<p>As a wrapper, this API exposes only a subset of the full functionality, but it&#x27;s a very useful subset.  Perhaps 80% of the complexity of the OpenSSL API comes from only 20% of use cases.  This API exposes only a small subset of functionality, but that&#x27;s what makes it simple and easy to use and it still covers 80% of use cases.  If you aren&#x27;t in that 80%, then this API isn&#x27;t for you.  But that&#x27;s ok!<p>It seems reasonable to expect multiple layers of cryptography libraries.  We ought to have a set of low-level libraries that implement the fundamental primitives in a general and orthogonal way.  It would be a sort of cryptography &quot;kernel&quot;.  Most developers wouldn&#x27;t use it in the same way that most don&#x27;t directly make syscalls into the OS kernel, but instead use a high-lever wrapper library.  To open a file, for example, we often use a wrapper like the functions in a libc, or a wrapper of a wrapper like libsqlite3.<p>So, if an API doesn&#x27;t cover your particular use case, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad.  You just need to find a different API.  The uses for cryptography are myriad.  It seems unreasonable to expect a single API to cover everything while remaining simple and easy to use.",1415384629

Here it is:<p>Adults in western societies compete with other adults in the market (in its broadest sense). You can see this, for example, in every job interview.<p>Usually, competition is benign.<p>Some forms of competition are not benign. We&#x27;ve decided for example that the competitive tactic of cornering a market and using that position to fix prices is malignant.<p>As a public policy matter, we allow the market to operate freely except in those cases where the competition becomes malignant.<p>As a public policy matter, we&#x27;ve decided that it&#x27;s malignant to allow the form of competition where the winner is the person most willing to compromise their sexual integrity.<p>We can do that even while understanding that different people have different notions of what comprises &quot;sexual integrity&quot;. That&#x27;s because we recognize that if you allow competition based on sexual compromise, the market races to the bottom, and we operate at the lowest common denominator of &quot;sexual integrity&quot;. The market punishes people for not compromising. That emergent property takes on the coercive force of public policy.<p>In the same sense as there&#x27;s no <i>intrinsic</i> moral problem with buying a specific amount of, say, lysine, but there is with buying all the lysine and fixing prices, there&#x27;s no <i>intrinsic</i> moral problem with exchanging money for sex, but there&#x27;s an emergent problem with allowing people to compete based on their willingness to sell sex.<p>Put more simply: legalizing prostitution would be at least in some sense (and I think probably in a very powerful sense) coercive of poor women, and particular poor single mothers who have an extraordinarily powerful obligation to finance the upbringing of their children. Not selling your body would become a luxury. It&#x27;s terrible public policy that allows that to happen.<p>It happens, obviously, regardless of the policy levers we pull.

Mine has none whatsoever (Well, it does have a kill switch so it doesn't go zooming away if I fall off, and it does shut down if it finds itself tipped more than 45 degrees.) Those details are kind of important, and you should think about them carefully before considering building such a thing yourself. With a scooter like this, if it stops working for any reason (software crash, hardware failure, low battery) you will fall, hard, and probably on your face. Imagine zipping along at 10 MPH, and suddenly the platform you're standing on stops dead. Oh, and there's a T-bar in front of you to trip you up if you start to run. So you really shouldn't try to replicate this experiment, and I can't be responsible for what happens if you read this and try to build something.</i>",1251935364

Greyhound goes practically everywhere (just not on a convenient schedule/time frame for most people).  Also, starting off in Chicago, you've got a fairly major Amtrak hub nearby where you can reach nearly any point in the U.S. by train for a reasonable cost as well.<p>I would set aside enough money to take Greyhound back to wherever you plan to call home afterwards (from the furthest point away, so you cannot get stranded), then plan out cost to ride Greyhound from place to place.  This should give you cheaper day to day costs, but puts you at the mercy of where you're going.<p>This is where the blog/donate will help out.  Put at least a week's notice of what date you plan on being in which city, look for folks to interview and a spot to crash.  Ideally you'll be able to ""tail"" someone for a day or two to really see how their business goes while you're interviewing them.  This also would provide for a very interesting read (a day in the life of a entrepreneurs, and not just 1 famous guy, even just in the trenches never heard of them before entrepreneurs).

I doubt that the connectome is sufficient.<p>>A lot of their statements seem to focus on future viability...<p>IIRC they talk about uploading issues under the code word &quot;information-theoretic criterion of death&quot;, meaning that a preserved brain could be totally non-viable while still containing enough information to be uploaded; you&#x27;re only dead if that information is destroyed, i.e. irretrievable &quot;in principle&quot; to an observer with full knowledge of human neurobiology and perfect scanning technology.<p>>future viability of the tissue, and options for biological reanimation - but these are things I have no interest in<p>Agree, I&#x27;m not particularly worried about viability. Side note: it is a lot easier to pitch reanimation than uploading to most peopleÂ (not that it&#x27;s easy either way).<p>>One can only imagine the public outcry involving bringing conserved brains back to life will be magnitudes larger than whatever will happen in respect to AGI soon<p>This being mildly hilarious, because the risks from non-human strong AGI are way way larger than those from reanimated humans or even uploads...<p>>But even if they were as stable as, say a major bank: well, those fail, too.<p>This isn&#x27;t clear to me. Cryonics companies have a totally different business plan from banks. Each customer pays a large fixed cost up front before services are rendered, creating an endowment thing that should pay for them indefinitely. Specifically, they could make very conservative investments, such that it would take a world collapse to drive them under. In theory.<p>>hundreds of years until our nano tech is sufficiently advanced.<p>Hmmm... I think I would be pretty surprised if it took an unregulated nanotech industry more than 50--100 years to develop near-arbitrary capabilities. The roadblock to biological reanimation would be knowing what to specify to build, not the building part. (I agree that intuitively, scanning, if not actual uploading, should be much easier.)<p>>And that&#x27;s too long for two fragile companies to keep afloat in the face of economic crises, religious and cultural disapproval, incompetence and malice, accidents, disasters, and world events - any single one of which can wipe everything out.<p>This is a pretty complicated question, but how do you think each of these risk factors would respond to broader adoption of cryonics? My guesses:<p>economic crises: significantly mitigated, because of economies of scale making it cheaper and overall scale making companies less vulnerable to variance. E.g. cryonics companies could build their own liquid nitrogen condensation plants, which are not that expensive at scale, I believe.<p>incompetence and malice: similar---at scale, companies could afford to defend against these<p>religious and cultural disapproval: unclear to me; how much of a threat would this be, and how hard would it be to get people to come around?<p>accidents: not much to do about this. Hypothetically, with extremely wide adoption of cryonics, there could be safety policy decisions made based on the calculation &quot;How many accidents leading to non-cryopreservable brains will this lead to?&quot;.<p>disasters and world events: no help here. At scale, could slightly defend against tamer disasters with underground bunkers or something.",1432511436

They&#x27;ve spent wildly to keep the building spree going; even now their real estate market is crashing, it has been falling for a year.<p>It begs a simple question: how many more people can China transition out of old China&#x27;s poverty, and into the new China&#x27;s middle class, before they run out of the ability to accumulate more debt to keep it all going (global consumers are tapped out, which has left China&#x27;s manufacturing boom dead in the water, with their PMI contracting during a supposed non-recessionary period).<p>I fail to see how thinking ahead equates to taking on tens of trillions in new debt to fake economic growth.

Banging your head in desperation against a wall - repeatedly - without hope for relief - hard. You cry in despair, doing one exercise after the other. Until forever and ever - until - you get it.<p>And then you have achieved mastering the lesson. But only by working through exercises, thinking, reasoning about possible solutions, talking to your peers, taking a break, sweat and tears, failing, falling, getting yourself up and going again - going the hard way.<p>There is no easy way - Think Bruce Lee training kind of hard way.<p>Easy is for dumb computers - you know the type. simple instruction set. Execution of given command path - without thinking, no personality, no ingenuity, no soul required.<p>The way they teach math in schools, art, history, humanities and STEM. You just need to pass tests. Given command paths. To be executed flawlessly.<p>Understanding is not required, just obedience.<p>And that is what our education system is made for - obedient executors of society - sheeple.<p>Depriving a child of the opportunity of tackling a hard problem is the worst abuse you can do to a developing mind.\nBy dumbing down the goals to achieve - nobody uses math in their real life, you are not gonna need it. History is gone - why bother. The meaning of a poem ? What would that be for ?<p>Another form of abuse is to abandon a failing student - certifying the failure as if it were the students fault, taking all the chances from a young life just because a test was not passed. Throwing away the hopes and  opportunities which might have been realized if only there had been someone to help along the difficult path.<p>And that is something &quot;turning education around&quot; is not going to achieve - if the only thing that is going to change is that we do no longer employ a teacher per 30 students per hour but one recording of one teacher for all mankind once for all eternity.<p>The chance of online education, of transforming the way we learn is about community.

There should be pride and recognition by your peers and families for achieving a goal - and the support to struggle with learning.<p>Like the MMORG players do. Actually, the point in developing a successful game is about balancing frustration and joy. That is what is needed for education.<p>But in most cases the failing of students is just due to the basics.<p>Having a meal when hungry basic.<p>Having security and safety in your life basic.<p>Having someone to confide in basic.<p>Having the opportunity to be allowed to sleep basic.<p>Having the feeling of being accepted, wanted, loved basic.<p>So how to transform education ?<p>Get the basics right.<p>Education is a basic human right and duty, not a personal investment into your future which is only for the rich.<p>challenge the students.<p>Make them work together.<p>Support and accompany them on their journey.<p>Be proud of the students achievements.<p>It takes an entire village to raise kids.

9597939,comment,9595853,9597838,0,0,Udo,,,"<i>> Could you say why you think this?</i><p>During my time as a medical research minion I did some work on preserving tissue samples and even whole organs, including plastination and similar resin casts. What you need to be aware of is that, while the finished specimen look very good and life-like, they are radically altered on a biochemical level. All the water and lipids get replaced by resin. That requires soaking them in formaldehyde, acetone, and other chemicals before resin can even be applied. This process absolutely destroys proteins, in fact it relies on that. Also, the whole process takes days to complete, and during that time bio matter is actually being washed out and the whole structure is in motion. There is absolutely no question that information is lost here, in droves. If you believe plastination has a decent chance of preserving people&#x27;s minds, you&#x27;re operating under the assumption that the connectome itself will yield enough data for an upload.<p>Compared to that, freezing is, well freezing. Molecular motion almost ceases, so the most important aspect to gauge information loss in cryonics is what happens to the brain until it&#x27;s finally cooled down. There are three main problems here. The first is the formation and shape of ice crystals which can (and do) destroy cells. This is a bit more relevant to in-vivo reanimation enthusiasts, because the physical shearing should probably be algorithmically correctable in a scan scenario. The second is the effect of the cryo fluid they pump into patients to prevent said ice crystals from forming, because it&#x27;s also toxic to proteins. It&#x27;s not as invasive as plastination, but it&#x27;s still pretty bad. The third aspect is the time span from asystole to the halting of information loss. This might be a problem, but since current research indicates that a lot of ischemic brain damage is actually a cascade triggered by re-perfusion, there is cause for the assumption that anything up to a few hours might actually be fine.<p><i>> Were you convinced by the experiments done by the Cryonics Institute or Alcor?</i><p>I have to admit to only a passing knowledge of their in-house research efforts. Alcor&#x27;s that is, I know next to nothing about CI. The problem is, they - nor anyone else for that matter - are not in a position to make any substantive claims about information fidelity <i>beyond</i> the continuing efforts to preserve the brain as faithfully as possible. A lot of their statements seem to focus on future viability of the tissue, and options for biological reanimation - but these are things I have no interest in (because I think it&#x27;s both unrealistic and a bad deal). In fact, the last time I visited Alcor&#x27;s site I couldn&#x27;t find any reference to uploading at all, maybe I just missed it though.<p><i>> Political, maybe, if the the legal status of patients changes so that they are required to be thawed.</i><p>Yes, I agree. It&#x27;s a massive taboo, ask any random person on the street and they&#x27;ll be horrified. It&#x27;s not difficult to imagine neuropreservation might get outlawed as soon as it looks like it might actually be feasible. In fact, we&#x27;re seeing the same thing happening now with AGI. One can only imagine the public outcry involving bringing conserved brains back to life will be magnitudes larger than whatever will happen in respect to AGI soon.<p><i>> But why economical or technological?</i><p>By definition, cryonics companies have to operate on the fringe. That makes them especially vulnerable to disruption from relatively minor events. But even if they were as stable as, say a major bank: well, those fail, too. And if they&#x27;re not going bankrupt, one might imagine a power outage lasting for months. Or some other infrastructure catastrophe that results in these companies being unable or unwilling to maintain services. Us western countries are kind of operating under the assumption that we&#x27;re stable and eternal, which is an illusion.<p>That&#x27;s why I said it&#x27;s a solution for the next decades at best. During that time, if we really want to put resources behind it, we could theoretically figure out a destructive scanning -> uploading workflow (simulation can come later in principle). But if we&#x27;re talking about biological reanimation... there is not even a tenuous time frame imaginable. We could easily talk hundreds of years until our nano tech is sufficiently advanced. And that&#x27;s too long for two fragile companies to keep afloat in the face of economic crises, religious and cultural disapproval, incompetence and malice, accidents, disasters, and world events - any single one of which can wipe everything out.",1432508403

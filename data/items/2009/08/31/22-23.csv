796891,comment,796573,796640,0,0,pg,,,"Interesting question.<p>Not all investors are VCs.  There are also angel investors, and we are much more like angels, both in our backgrounds and the part of the startup world we occupy.  Angels don't have a lot of habits, either good or bad.  They're mostly just individuals who got rich from their own startups; their personalities are not much affected by being investors.<p>The one thing that makes us different from angels is that we invest on such a large scale.  We have a brand name and an office and a web site and all that.  Would that engender any habits, though?  I can't think of any.<p>I definitely don't think we have any of the habits of VCs that are mentioned in this list.  The fact that VCs dress up and try to project an aura of power comes from being finance guys, not VCs per se; investment bankers are the same (and in fact are indistinguishable to me).  And we don't have the luxury of being sheep, because we have to decide whether or not to invest in a company the same day we meet them.",1251759259

796884,comment,796685,796828,0,0,enjo,,,"I absolutely think your correct. I fully expect Android to eclipse the iPhone in market share within the next 3 years. I say that with a couple of caveats, however:<p>1. Google has to get serious about competing with Apple. They need to adopt multi-touch, and they need to do it NOW. I get there is a legal question around it, but that didn't stop them from aggressively pursuing YouTube.<p>2. Google needs to show that they're serious. The app-store for Android is a mess (as the article clearly articulates). There is a lot of money to be made there, but Google needs to step up to the plate and make that a vibrant eco-system. They need to be Microsoft to Apples..well.. Apple. Be more developer friendly, more marketing friendly, and let the openness of their system eclipse the closed off world of the iPhone.<p>If they do that, Android should be a huge win. They've built the technology. Just as S60 dominates the smart phone market today, Android is similarly positioned. It can support a lot of price points and a lot of different form factors. That variety allows for a huge number of devices to collectively drive that share through the roof.<p>Since the device is more open, it creates an environment for developers to build truly killer apps that utilize the full system in a much more advanced way. Again, that is predicated on Googles ability to bring a truly robust store to their phones. If they do, that further increases Android's viability and gives them a marked advantage over the iPhone.<p>Google is REALLY close with this.. they just need to take the next step.",1251758890

796881,comment,796470,796470,0,0,natrius,,,"I don't agree with the common diagnosis of what ails the newspaper industry. If newspapers focused primarily on their online products, people would probably enjoy them more.<p>What would that cause? Existing online readers would generate more page views. Many print readers would switch to the digital version. Attracting <i>new</i> readers is unlikely. Local publications have about as much market share as they could ever hope to have[1]. The rest of the market probably just doesn't want their news via text, or doesn't care about news at all.<p>If most of the effects from improving online content are from moving readers from print to online and increasing page views from existing users, <i>you've just lost money</i>. Print ads are more profitable than online ads, so losing a print reader to the online version is a loss. More page views from existing readers isn't much of a gain. Newspapers rarely sell out their online ad inventory. From my understanding, that gives us two scenarios for advertisers:<p>1) The advertiser has bought as many ads as they can afford.<p>2) The advertiser has bought ads for their entire desired audience, and would buy more if it were available.<p>Advertisers in group 1 can't afford more ads at all, so there's no hope there. In group 2, increasing page views of existing readers accomplishes little to nothing. The advertisers already advertise to those readers, and are unlikely to want to show more ads to them.<p>That leaves us with few significant avenues for increasing revenue. You can try to kill Craigslist, or increase ad yield by targeting and delivering ads more effectively, both of which seem rather difficult.<p>Improving the online news experience would be cool, but it's not profitable enough to save the industry as so many claim.<p>[1] For example, <a href=""http://www.statesman.com/search/content/advertising/media_kit/audience.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statesman.com/search/content/advertising/media_ki...</a>",1251758767

It is true in probably every respect of the two platforms, but it is especially true when it comes to the respective app stores. So in that case my prognosmification would be that, even if you're right and Android is where the iPhone is today in a few years, Apple's platform would have grown too by then, maybe even proportionally to Android.<p>Which does not mean one should not develop applications for Android or that they shouldn't ""plan for it"".

After looking at the high prices on the XBee chips I got a few of these same transmitters and receivers from Sparkfun to build a remote control for one of my robots. The chips have a lot of quirks but are not very hard to figure out despite some comments to the contrary on Sparkfun. If you are interested in Arduino I would <i>highly</i> recommend Tom Igoe's book Making Things Talk. The book is filled with a ton of wireless projects and walks you through the Arduino basics. If you are in L.A. and interested in Arduino I recommend checking out the occasional Arduino classes offered at Machine Project (www.machineproject.com).",1251756365

I considered creating a sort of peer kudos/badge feature as well but there are a lot of issues to overcome with that. Basically the same problems Twitter has. How do I stop people from giving the ""free diet pills award!"" :) Thoughts?",1251756184

You will lose some power in the transformer, but the waveform will be much smoother.",1251756031

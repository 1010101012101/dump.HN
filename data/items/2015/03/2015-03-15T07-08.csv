Considering that we (self-organizing collections of matter) exist in a universe where entropy tends to a maximum, doing work is necessary to maintain our existence.<p>As for the moral argument as to why people on welfare are often viewed negatively, I think the reasoning is fairly obvious - most taxpayers are doing work which they don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy, and may become annoyed if they think they are being exploited by people who are not working. Hence why nobody cares if a person who is <i>not</i> on welfare doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Finally, I would be interested to know what specific jobs the author is referring to as &quot;BS jobs&quot;.

9205770,comment,9205177,9205177,0,0,lazyseq,,,"Regarding hackathons, I&#x27;ve felt much the same as you. I let many of my team members go to these events to keep them happy, motivated, and to network. I have met many people from these events, brought them in for interview, tried to find people to start a start-up with, and so on.<p>Full disclosure - I&#x27;ve only gone to hackathons to accompany co-workers to provide advice and to network, I don&#x27;t have any desire to actually participate.<p>Anyway, my general view on hackathons are they are a waste of time. If you want to learn something, learn by doing a real task, not a contrived one for a hackathon. If you are taking a more practical idea into a hackathon, sit on it, use that time to think it through, and build it on your own time, rather than in a noisy room. I get that people want to network, that they need motivated, and that constraints/goals/focus can inspire them, but I really feel that in software development, that&#x27;s just people looking for an excuse. If you want to build something, build it. If you want a constraint, write it on a piece of paper yourself and follow it. If you lack the creativity to make something without the help of a hackathon, you are probably a lost cause anyway.<p>You can experiment with that new technology yourself. You don&#x27;t need the group to tell you what you are doing is right or cool. The group is often wrong or misguided. History is full of bad group think. The way I see it is that if you are really a computer scientist, look at your computer and the world around you for a few minutes. You should easily see thousands of problems that need to be solved or can be solved better. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it is polishing an old tech or a crazy new idea that throws out everything we learned before. I have more problems to solve than I can handle in a lifetime and I cannot imagine wasting that time at a hackathon in that kind of ridiculous environment.<p>You mentioned that there is definitely a bro/framework/money culture and I agree. Look at all the &quot;schwag&quot; and advertisements at most bigger hackathons. People want you to buy things and to use their stuff. Putting time constraints on people doesn&#x27;t make them automatically more creative, often it just forces them into using whatever framework because of the nature of the hackathon so they can get something complete. This is constraining creativity usually, not encouraging it. This is not some romatic story about a lab deep in the bowles of MIT where the next great clean energy will save the universe, it is a gathering of guys trying to out muscle each other&#x27;s egos. The bros will dominate because of this and will always be there in some form.<p>Check the experience level. Notice that a lot of great programmers don&#x27;t go to these events. Why? They are working and don&#x27;t really care, and nor should they. If you want to have some fun with people, start asking your colleagues and friends why they are going to XYZ events, hackathon, whatever. Strangely enough, most people I have asked can&#x27;t explain and give reasons like free pizza, chance to win an ipad, or to hear a presentation about ABC technology.  Is it worth losing a day of work or the weekend for that? Can you not read things in more depth at home or even just watch the video later? What is the point?<p>The point is perhaps to just participate in more group activities and feel part of something. There are similar reasons why people go to religious services, join fraternities and clubs, and post on message boards. People like meeting like-minded people. When a dominant sub-group emerges within a group, it becomes the group and usually drives out the fringes. I remember older and smaller versions of hackathons and meetups at people&#x27;s houses, garages, etc. in decades past. It was really the same thing where bad actors eventually dominated, and perhaps for awhile there was a period where it felt fun, then stopped. Very little has changed, only scale and the way the same personality types manifest themselves in the context of the time.<p>Don&#x27;t get discouraged by these people. They are everywhere, in every sub-culture. If they want to call themselves stupid terms like &quot;hackers&quot; instead of software developers, so be it. If companies want to be idiots and put up job ads calling for &quot;rockstar programmers,&quot; just ignore them and take it as early notice that working there would probably suck. If someone wants to shove their glued frameworks in your face and claim they are awesome, just point out exactly what they have done and how simple, or better yet, just do something better yourself. You be the example, and you be the good guy.<p>But yes, you are right, I hate these people and I too feel they are unethical with stupid ideas that advance nothing. I think this shameful bubble of valuations of companies that don&#x27;t really produce anything including actual revenue based on something real (ads don&#x27;t count, sorry, if advertising would die and take 98% of the internet with it, so be it) need to die a quick death.",1426406271

You have fast compression available that can increase your effective bandwidth and make the effective cost of space cheaper.<p>You can draw on well-understood ways to search, sort, do hash- or sort-based joining and grouping, and so on.<p>Streaming doesn&#x27;t need a big in-memory cache to avoid disk seeks, so you can use those gobs of RAM for other things--aggregating results or holding data to join against, say. (Of course, if you don&#x27;t need the RAM, disk cache might still be useful for some access patterns.)<p>Besides log search, you see a stream-fast approach in analytics-focused DBs: BigQuery, Redshift, Vertica, and open-source ones--Facebook put up a good post about the work that led to the their Hive ORCFile design.<p>Some bioinformatics tools load a big hashtable into memory and, roughly, hash-join against a ton of raw data streamed from disk, then sometimes then repeat the process with another hashtable.<p>These are not at all original observations, but I managed to hear about these sorts of analytics and bioinformatics tools for a while before really getting how or why why they did things all that differently from a typical random-access-oriented database.",1426406001

9205714,comment,9203359,9204474,0,0,cbd1984,,,"> The upshot of all of this, according to Kuhn, is that the criteria for scientific truth are always caught up in certain historical assumptions and that we have to take these assumptions into account when assessing the veracity of a given theory.<p>If your historical assumptions are true in a useful way, your science will progress to the point where you have more-useful engineering; if they&#x27;re wrong in an important way, your science will stall out, or give you the wrong answers. If they&#x27;re neither, and they don&#x27;t affect the ultimate utility of your predictions one way or the other, it all becomes a bit academic: Is it even useful to say your theories are wrong if they keep making good predictions and allow scientific progress to be made? Note well that atomism (pre-quantum) and geocentrism eventually stopped making good predictions, stopped being a gateway to more complete theories, or both. (For example, geocentrism is probably impossible to integrate with universal gravitation.)<p>&quot;Truth&quot; is something mathematics has access to, not physics. Truth-With-A-Capital-T is Absolute, Perfect, Incorruptible, and utterly inconsistent with reality as it is outside of the symbol-games we play in our minds, because Platonism is downright insane.<p>Therefore, &quot;scientific truth&quot; is contingent, sure, but it&#x27;s contingent on more than mere fashions. It&#x27;s contingent on experimentation and experiments don&#x27;t care if your histories are contingent one way, the other, or the other way entirely. Nobody&#x27;s histories were contingent enough to imagine the Earth <i>repelled</i> small rocks.<p>So Kuhn agrees that there is a universe and that there are, at least potentially, facts about that universe humans are capable of discovering. That puts him a few up on some philosophers. However, I don&#x27;t agree that our criteria for scientific truth is fully entwined with our historical accidents as long as we rely on science to predict what the non-human world is going to do.",1426404728

You touch on a lot of hot topics here including agism, hackathons, &quot;hacker&quot; culture, brogrammers, and so on. I&#x27;ll try to write a few replies to address your concerns.<p>I am one of these &quot;older engineers&quot; as you describe. Mostly I am well-respected by anyone who works with me because I tend to intimidate, but also be very helpful and mentor people. I do feel a lot of disrespect from younger people I meet in the industry. I actually look extremely young for my age, but I can hardly pass as a 22-year old.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll start by discussing your generation stereotypically. I&#x27;ve been hiring people from universities for a few decades now and I am increasingly disappointed as time passes. Maybe I am just becoming a grouchy aging developer, my patience is wearing thin, or perhaps what I see is just reality. When I hire someone, especially out of school, I never expect them to know much about XYZ technology we use, ABC framework, or anything else I am using at the time. Simply, I look for smart people who I think my team can get along with in the workplace, are at least a tiny bit motivated to work, and are honest in every sense of the word. I learned the hard way it&#x27;s better to hire someone who is a good, honest, hard worker than someone full of great ideas that can&#x27;t execute or pisses everyone off each day.  Unfortunately, I find myself disgusted by the type people who show up for interview and that I have to deal with from other companies. I do not ask for much.<p>Perhaps in the words of William S Burroughs, a few &quot;words of advice for young people&quot; are needed:<p>Do not turn on your cell phone during an interview, show up on time, do some basic research about us before you arrive, understand at least bullet item we wrote on the job description, etc. I&#x27;m not your dad and most definitely not your bro. Do not show up to the interview in your free give-away Angular.js t-shirt you got. That technology or framework you are named dropping and then trying to use to feign knowledge about? Well, you aren&#x27;t fooling me, I probably used it or read about it, tried it, and realized that my instinct that it was garbage was true. I use more new technologies than you do because I am doing actual work as I have done for decades. Just because I am older than you doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t understand Ruby. Just because I don&#x27;t seem impressed by your node.js github project doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t get it. More likely I am not impressed because your code is terrible and I am shocked that it took you so many weeks and commits to do what you would be expected to finish in 1 day at our office.<p>Remember that class where you decided the professor was as a-hole and that it was just too early in the morning to go to anyway? Was it called data structures 101? Well, it&#x27;s going to bite you one day when you interview with me and you can&#x27;t tell me when you would use a hash table and when you would use a list. Remember when you interviewed with me and you didn&#x27;t get the job which you thought it was because I just didn&#x27;t like JavaScript? Well, you are wrong, you did not get the job because you could not explain basics in JavaScript, your favorite language. Go ahead and criticize us for using Foo technology, because even though it&#x27;s rock solid stable, works great in real-world production, and is making us millions, we were waiting for you to tell us to rip it out and replace it with Bar, which your buddy just put up on Github yesterday. But that&#x27;s OK, because we&#x27;re a lame company, and everything is our fault. We just need you to turn the ship around, so by all means, act like an idiot because there is no way we can live without your genius.<p>Do you want to impress me? Tell me what you know. Explain to me what will make you happy and motivated you. When you do not know something, admit it instead of trying to bs me. I hear enough bs from sales guys, marketing people, and VPs of the department of nothing to recognize bs before it leaves your lips. When you do not know something, do not give up. Tell me how you would do it differently or how you would go about finding the solution. If I give you hints or part of the solution, use it or even ask me for another hint. I am trying to help you because I am tired of interviewing people just like you. I want to hire you so I can get back to coding. I have already seen ten of you today, and I am currently considering offering a 5 million bounty for the next person who can sit in that chair and have even 20% of what we need to do the job.<p>You can be relaxed, just not too much. Most developers who have been at it for awhile really need to stay relaxed and do not take everything too seriously. You can have fun with us and talk to us. That does not give you a license to fool around, act unprofessional, or like an idiot. This is a job, and it takes very little else but hard work like any other job.

Instead I am using the SOCKS5 proxy in OpenSSH together with redsocks and iptables. For me this seems to be simpler and works everywhere. If you have a dedicated IP or your server runs SSLH then you can SSH to port 443 which is rarely if ever blocked.<p>Also, this allows for easy bastion hosts. While some tutorials still miss it, ssh has -W for 5+ years now and it makes creating bastion hosts even easier than when you needed nc in there. Hire a cheap physical server, put OpenBSD on it, run OpenSSH and absolutely nothing else. Firewall off everything from the sensitive servers except this server and there you go. Of course the bastion host does not have any credentials on it, agent forwarding is your friend.<p>Put your SSH key on a Yubikey NEO, the NEO on your keychain and never ever ever depart with it. Make it a habit not to be plugged into your laptop more than for the few seconds when actually log into a server. Stealing your laptop is pointless now.<p>If you work remotely then the exposure to social engineering is bigger as all chat facilities become an attack surface. Practice. Create a Skype account with a disturbingly similar screen name to your own Skype account and try to coax passwords out of your colleagues. If there are no static passwords to be had then you automatically win.<p>To me, full disk encryption was always of dubious value. You are sitting in a cafe someone walks in and suddenly grabs the laptop and runs out the door. What&#x27;s good your FDE? Instead, have nothing stored locally and work over SSH. Now at worst what the brazen attacker has is the files open in your IDE but can&#x27;t open any other files since the connection dropped and the yubikey is still with you. Also, when at the border you are not facing any issues since there are no passwords to be revealed (I do not want to get into a legal debate with anyone whether I can be forced to reveal a password. It&#x27;s easier to not have the issue.). Your laptop boots, runs etc. Just there&#x27;s nothing interesting on it.<p>I like the Yubikey as 2FA better than having some sort of 2FA on my phone because the keychain and the Yubikey is a much lower profile target than a phone. You probably have your keychain affixed to your belt/pocket by a carabiner or similar solutions so ordinary pickpockets, casual coffee shop thieves won&#x27;t easily walk away with it and honestly don&#x27;t want too much it either -- phones and laptops are too easy a target.

The cost is getting closer to netbooks, as well, though I guess the really thin and light laptops are still pretty pricey...they will converge fully eventually.<p>In short, tablet has taken the place of the &quot;crappy tiny laptop&quot;, and the modern good laptop has gotten closer to the size of the crappy tiny laptop without being crappy.

I think it tends towards unnecessary abstraction complication and ends up rather brittle in the end.
Try changing the post frequency from &quot;daily&quot;, for example. The code complexity, in this case, making a previously non-existing abstraction (post frequency) difficult to alter... better to start with the basic meteor 3-file default app (or something similarly simple) and build one&#x27;s app (and knowledge) from there...

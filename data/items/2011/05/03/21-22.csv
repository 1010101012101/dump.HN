Based on performance confirmation data, the NRC will determine whether the repository system or subsystem (natural or engineered) has failed or is expected to fail to meet the performance criteria. If such failure is determined at any time during the preclosure period, the NRC may direct the DOE to retrieve the waste. The DOE could retrieve waste for its own reasons without being directed by the NRC. Such activity, however, must be carried out under applicable NRC regulations governing movement of waste. It should be noted that the NRC retrievability provision in Part 60 is only intended to protect the public radiological health and safety.""<p>Summary: in case the repository method is all screwed up and we gotta put it somewhere else.",1304459924

The same thing can be done in every service provider in the EU as far as I know. I don't for a minute think that Australia's telcos wrote all their own backend software and I don't believe that this would be a high technical cost.

No one really knows why, but a small percentage of people end up getting worse. That could have been at play with your wife. Or it could have been a nocebo (negative placebo) effect, or just the course of the attack. For example, the worst panic attacks tend to come on suddenly with a defined liminal point (not an upward creep of anxiety throughout the day) and peak 3-7 minutes afterward. If she took the Xanax at the liminal point and felt worse 5 minutes later, that's not because of the drug, but the panic attack's initial upward swing.<p>The truth is that benzodiazepines don't really abort a panic attack-- at least not in the short (<5 minutes) term. Nothing really can. What benzos are great for is recovering <i>from</i> a panic attack and preventing it from rolling into another one. If your wife felt shitty for 5 minutes, but great at T=30 minutes, then it's not the drug's fault because the drug worked.<p>SSRIs also have a paradoxical effect. I think SSRIs are somewhat like a less risky version of electroconvulsive therapy: they induce a change of state in the brain, and the brain's response gets it out of a depressive cycle, but it's not clear why one state change (""shock"") works and another doesn't. To make it weirder, when people are on SSRIs for a while there's a tendency for the drug to stop working (""poop out""). No surprise: this sounds like tolerance. However, at this point both raising and lowering the doses can work. So it seems like <i>any</i> change in this state variable is what can cause the improvement, but no one really knows. (That said, <i>never</i> hard taper on an SSRI, and definitely don't reduce dosage without talking to a doctor.)",1304456993

2511658,comment,2511510,2511602,1,0,jerf,,,"""Ideas are worthless"" means that having some idea about how to make some money is cheap and worthless. It has to be instantiated quite laboriously with a lot of additional effort and lots of other ideas supporting the original core one. You can tell this happens because ten startups may start with the same ""idea"" but end up with completely different concrete solutions on different platforms with different tradeoffs and each taking ten man-years of work to create. It's in those ten man-years of work that the value lies, not the core idea.<p>As proof that is where the value lies, many solid businesses exist that have done the work but haven't even hardly got an ""idea"" the way startup founders think of it, just exploited opportunity. What's the ""big idea"" behind a graphics design firm, or a plumbing company? On the other hand, try making money with an uninstantiated idea. Where the value comes from is pretty clear.<p>Now that you've presumably done some of that work, the core original idea remains as useless as ever, but the work done around it to get it some distance down the path to instantiation is not. A new idea would be starting back at square one, and once again be, yes, worthless.<p>I doubt that he really wants the idea so much as he wants to move forward with the instantiation.<p>(Ideas with no instantiation effort put into them are worthless because basically supply is effectively infinite.)",1304456703

I think one reason for this thinking is because unless an idea is converted to an actual product there is no way to tell if it is good. But just because we can't judge whether an idea is good - does not mean ideas are cheap and worthless either. I think this notion was made popular by investors and VCs, and it makes sense in their cases - as they make nothing from mere ideas - only from products that sell. Outside the domain of startups and VCs, ideas are very  precious indeed - just ask scientists who work on ideas  that can create brand new industries. Quantum physics was just an idea with equations - but we would not have any of modern electronics, lasers, computers or mobile phones.  Which brings us to tbe  second part of your question - why can't we think of better ones. My theory is that the human brain is wired to perceive  what exists and act on it, whereas innovation requires perceving what does not exist and seeing the gaps. It is much harder for the human brain to focus on this. Which is why it is easier to improve upon what already exists than it is to create a brand new product.",1304456551

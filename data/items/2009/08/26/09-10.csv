Do you trust Amazon's VPN, privacy mechanisms, etc. or do you prefer a third-party provider? Similar to: do you trust MS Firewall or the one of a third-party provider?<p>But I think it is more than only addressing perception - the alternative until today was building your own VPN by hand and dealing with all those dynamic IP addresses. Very awkward and error prone...",1251280628

Insecure transit was not the primary problem with AWS for those situations and those companies.  There are many ways to securely send data over the Internet, and most don't require IPsec to be provided by Amazon.<p>The network isolation is somewhat interesting...but it makes me wonder why non-""private"" AWS services aren't already isolated at the network layer.  There's no reason why they couldn't be.  They already control everything that goes in and out of every virtual machine in their data center, there's no reason the default should be for any machine to be able to talk directly to any other machine.",1251280010

Serving the country for a few years with passion and vigor is noble and heroic, but long term civil service risks stagnation, politicking, and corruption.<p>A Senator going out into the world to work on problems without government behind them would bolster their worldview. Perhaps after two terms in the Senate, a mandatory one or two terms off, then the Senator could run again. But definitely, lifetime politicians are a big potential problem.

Like idlewords said, it was something where I didn't have a choice.<p>At the University of Pittsburgh, Sodexho is the exclusive provider of on-campus food. The food and service have since gotten better, but my freshman year, Sodexho had a policy of hiring many ex-convicts for their food service positions. I ate at the sub place on campus a lot because it was close to my dorm and decent enough. The full-time workers there were two men 70+ in age, though maybe the hard living had aged them beyond their years. They had faded ink tattoos visible on their arms and had clearly recently been released from prison after near-lifetime sentences.<p>I cannot express how much these men hated their jobs. They hated their customers. Every time I ate there and made the mistake of looking them in the eye, I could tell that they wished death upon me and everyone that ever ate a sub made by their hands.<p>Since then, I have eaten in the private sector, and while every worker is not happy, they are usually at worst indifferent.

I understand it, and I reject it as a useful paradigm for any of the classes of program that I would like to write.  That's an easy ""out"", right?  Whereby it's easy to say ""oh, you obviously don't write programs of type x"", but I have enough confidence in my experience doing both general-purpose commercial programming and very specialist research programming to think that I can at least make that judgement on the basis of a reasonably large set of problem domains.

1257209,comment,1257027,1257099,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"This reminds me of the experiences of GE under Jack Welch, with his ""rank-and-yank"" initiative: 10 percent, each year, gets fired. It relies on the faulty assumption that the percentage of good vs. bad employees is constant.<p>First year, you can fire 10% without much complaint, because most of the people you're getting rid of are deadwood. Second year, it's a bit harder. Third year, the obvious deadwood is gone and nobody wants to lay off 10% of their workers. This is when people start getting pissed off.<p>The enforced rank distribution is just there to make it easier to fire people. They're afraid of termination lawsuits that might occur if someone gets fired with a trail of 4s and 5s.",1271005485

The first couple of versions of C# did indeed suck the rear-end of an ass, but the latest version has functional programming, lambda functions and the ability to extend any class you want with a function.<p>If you want the security of a static language (or, like me, need it to avoid doing stupid things), you really should take another look at it; when I did so, I was quite surprised myself.<p>As for Java, well I don't write Java anymore - these days I mostly just use short cuts in Eclipse so that it writes the stuff I need.",1271005380

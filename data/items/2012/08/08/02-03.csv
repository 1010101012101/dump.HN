Google could have decided not to offer application-specific passwords at all, but from any individual user's perspective, that's exactly equivalent to just not using them.  At least having application-specific passwords gives you the option, and is at <i>least</i> as secure as giving your master password away to every client application.<p>I suppose there is one possible negative consequence to users who opt not to use app-specific passwords: their existence alone removes some of the incentive for client applications to implement 2-factor themselves (which I don't know if Google even has an API for).  And sure, it would be nice to have features like access control on a per password basis (e.g., so I could allow Pidgin to access only gchat, but no other part of my account).  But the implication that the mere existence of application-specific passwords somehow makes Google's 2 factor auth useless is just wrong.",1344394264

4353596,comment,4351689,4352246,6,0,rogerbinns,,,"There are so many things I can think of.  The taxi/rental/on demand model is far more likely to happen because who needs to own a car 100% of the time.  Ride sharing is also easier - I suspect many people would be happy going a few minutes out of their way for halving the cost of their journey.  (Computer systems would automatically manage supply and matching demand, as well as pricing.)<p>Not only do you need less parking for fewer cars, but you could have less parking for the same number of cars.  For example there is no need for stores to have huge car parks - customer and employee cars can go and wait somewhere else and only return to the front door just as you come out with your goods.  This can lead to far denser human centric areas.<p>Some roads can actually be decommissioned.  Vehicles can load balance across existing alternatives and respond far quicker to developing bottlenecks.  Occupied vehicles can be given priority over shorter routes than non-occupied ones.<p>Deliveries can be done without drivers.  For example the delivery vehicle can drive to your home, work or anywhere else and you enter a code to get your items vending machine style.<p>It will give people greater freedom.  For example if your vision isn't acceptable, or you have physical issues then it won't matter.  In general the maladies that come with age won't affect mobility anywhere near as much as they do today.<p>Drives can be over longer distances as there is no driver fatigue.  Perhaps there could be sleeper cars for when you want to go somewhere overnight.<p>Heck they can even do things like deal with you in the vehicle while you are driving to an airport or a border.  You could show your passport, answer questions, check luggage etc.  And then go straight through the border or walk straight to your gate at airport, or even be driven to a closer access point to the gate.<p>And I suspect we never get flying cars out of this.  When the two dimensional earth surface is used so much more efficiently, why expand into 3 dimensions?  And since we can increase the speed the more vehicles are automated, what advantage does flight have?",1344393671

I started off planning to say that 'apposed' is not a word, and that you've made some sort of grievous error. I opened up multiple tabs, firing off google searches looking for a ""common errors"" page or at least a definition of ""opposed"" and the google page redirecting a search for ""apposed"" to it -- but then your counterstroke hit.<p>Google returned ""apposed"" just fine, and gave its definition as ""Place (something) in proximity to or juxtaposition with something else.""<p>Didn't faze me. ""Google must just be reporting the error because it's crept into common usage"", I told myself. I went deeper.<p>Brian's corner of common errors speaks to this briefly[1], but in the context of saying ""I appose your decision"", not in the context of the idiom. It also mentions ""as a pose to"" where ""as opposed to"" is intended, and assumes ""opposed"" instead of ""apposed""[2].<p>I wandered into english-usage-debate forums and found that 'apposed' is disliked for being rare, but not disallowed[3], and an interesting bit of discussion came up about intentionally chosen differences[7] -- which do seem detectable in the modern definitions: ""place beside"", versus ""place against"". I also found discussion about british/american meanings for ""as opposed to"" [4].<p>The online etymology dictionary ([5] and [6]) says that since the 14th and 15th century, these have been marginally separately derived words of ... roughly identical meaning.<p>To sum up, through redundancy 'apposed' seems to have fallen out of favour in contemporary english and taken on a nuanced definition to some of those who still use it. If there were something for me to criticize about your usage it would be that you've chosen a sentence that leans more toward ""place against"" than ""place beside"", so the contemporary idiom to use ""oppose"" would likely apply. But I think you could justify it if you want to. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/appose.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/appose.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/more.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/more.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.essayforum.com/grammar-usage-13/as-opposed-as-apposed-as-apposed-19245/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.essayforum.com/grammar-usage-13/as-opposed-as-app...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.englishforums.com/English/AsOpposedTo/hkvbq/post.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.englishforums.com/English/AsOpposedTo/hkvbq/post....</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=oppose"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=oppose</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=appose"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=appose</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.englishforums.com/English/AsOpposedToOrAsApposedTo/ncvpk/post.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.englishforums.com/English/AsOpposedToOrAsApposedT...</a><p>edit: I messed up the references pretty badly on my initial take.",1344392328

As if the hard part was making a bunch of pictures.<p>Yeah, it really bothered me that the WYSIWYG editor and interactive map features were sold under the guise of a rebranding.  The interactive map feature itself would have monumental complexity. Good ideas are a dime a dozen...this is one I've had before.  But it's not like ""oh, ok let's change some CSS and bingo!

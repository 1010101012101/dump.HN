3471392,comment,3470946,3470946,18,0,crescentfresh,,,"Something about the marketing of this makes me feel uneasy.<p>The graphs that depict size are misleading. The initial release (today) is already at v0.9 and the site (opened 1 week ago?) says it's ""fully ready to use in production""
The video aims to enumerate and demonstrate a number of issues with jQuery UI and Sencha touch (""we can't get anything to work...""). ""Zepto is slow"", Zepto objects are big and have ""large footprints"". ""We polled a large group of developers..."".<p>This is OSS. Why is the trashing of other developer's work necessary in promoting your own?<p>On the other hand I do appreciate that someone has delved into mobile issues and is trying to address them. But why market it like this? Why tack on ""an HTML5-ready jQuery"" for no (apparent) reason. CSS3 transitions aren't html5. querySelectorAll is not html5. Those other libraries don't have their problems because they are not ""HTML5"".<p>I don't know, it doesn't sit right.",1326733145

Switzerland has had them for hundreds of years and is still sane.<p>On the other hand, having a opaque 2-party dictatorship like the US has no does not somehow prevent religion to have a major influence on politics and laws. You have it on your money (in god we trust), you have it in your schools (one nation united under god), you have it in your courtrooms and presidential inaugurations (so help me god), etc.<p>Introducting a switzerland-like mechanism for more checks and balances wouldnt change much, it would just make it easier to prevent autocratic decisions like SOPA, Iraq war, etc.",1326733142

Consider that the language is glorified assembly against a (somewhat) defined virtual machine.<p>The functional description of the routine is ""Hey, so, look at this byte in memory and copy it to this other byte, leave if the byte copied was zero, otherwise increment both addresses and do it again.""<p>There is nothing there that need be ""proven""--it's all right there! If you have a sequence of bytes with a null, it terminates; if you don't, it doesn't. Boom. Done.<p><i>You can't prove logically that the while loop inside will end given any random input.</i><p>It's not intended to be used with any random input. Zed, programs are not written to turn arbitrary data into what you want--that entire notion is absurd. You have to make assumptions somewhere. strcpy() et al. are written with the knowledge that those assumptions are being made elsewhere in the system. With that being the case, the routine can be written as short as is needed to perform its task.<p><i>If you wrote code like that then I'd flag it as a bug, so how is it that strcpy is somehow reclassified as ""unsafe"" but yeah totally not a bug?</i><p>Perhaps because your bug detector is broken, and everyone else knows that tools can be dangerous <i>and</i> useful?<p>It is <i>not a bug</i> because it will do <i>exactly what it claims to do</i>, and nothing different--it is deterministic. It will copy bytes from one place to another through it hiting a null (or segfaults). This is not a bug--the domain of behavior is well known. The implementation is correct and the algorithm is simple.<p>It is <i>unsafe</i> because if you are incorrect in fulfilling the preconditions for using it (i.e., your source buffer isn't null terminated and your destination buffer is too small) it may have undesirable behavior.<p>It is <i>unsafe</i> because in the real world you get strings from other libraries whose authors may or may not have done a good job of terminating them in all annoying use cases.<p>It is <i>unsafe</i> because in the real world you can have another part of the program screw up and corrupt the string pointer it is being given, landing it in the middle of the heap far away from a saving terminator.<p>~<p>There are plenty of very good reasons not to use strcpy() when you don't control the entire flow into and out of it. You don't have to complain about it being buggy (which it isn't, at least in the distro of libc I'm using) or defective (which it isn't, as it does <i>exactly what the spec says it should do</i>).<p>You could just point out these issues and then show how to wrap them. The use of strncpy() would be an acceptable substitute here, as another user has pointed out, as it addresses the safety concern.<p>~<p>Stop encouraging new programmers to be afraid (blindly and without reason!) of their tools, and stop setting a bad example for being pigheaded and imprecise in the language of software development.",1326732189

At the scale of HN now, I think we have to consider people not as individuals but as a swarm of actors; perhaps analogous to particles in a CFD analysis. Then ask the question 'what design changes need to be made to change the direction of these actors'. I don't personally assume the worst in people but I don't think people are naturally moral actors. They won't 'do the right thing' without any incentives. People are driven by the positive and negative consequences of their actions which they measure from the reactions of their peers. In the case of HN our peers are the crowd sourced 'off the cuff' opinions of a random sample of a few hundred thousand random people. Some people are horrified by the idea that morals don't exist and it is a bit of a scary concept being surrounded by potential monsters, but really I think it's just nature and lots of natural things are scary but can be mitigated by design.",1326731487

But honestly, isn't it a little naive to think that the company holding your data won't have <i>some</i> access to it? I tend to believe that unless it's on a machine you own then someone else can and will look at it in some way. They may not look at the contents but they most certainly will check out the file type, size, name, date created, etc.<p>Now if you upload ""HowToBeat37Signals.docx"" to Basecamp you should probably assume two things. There's the possibility, however remote, that someone not authorized will see it (that possibility exists on every farmed out service, no server is hacker proof despite GoDaddy's little badges) and if someone does see it and it gets leaked or used against you, you'll have a damn good chance of suing the bejesus out of them.<p>The word trust is the key word here. Whenever you use a service to store sensitive material there has to be some level of trust. I think it's a mistake to trust that no one within the company or as a result of a security breach will absolutely never ever see what you've stored. What you do trust is that the odds of that happening are supremely low and if someone were to see your data (at least within the company) that they won't use it against you or share it. History has shown us that no web service is 100% secure and reliable so if you aren't comfortable with your odds then you shouldn't use the service.

The US government is fearing a threat that things are about to run off the tracks.  I consider this bill just one of many that will be coming down the pike in various forms - the meta message simply being a war against technology, or trying to contain it to keep the concept of American life in check.  Now that the word is getting out about this a retreat and rethink is in order to figure out how to broach legislation that moves toward this goal.  All the other side has to do is frame this as ""we're moving toward being like China"" and the propaganda machine is thrown for a loop, because clearly, that is the idea to be avoided.

How much ""holding by the hand"" should a tutor do, really?<p>The examples the author gives are very relevant to my point. The behaviour of a web browser when pressing ""BackSpace"" or of an interpreter when leaving an opening quote unmatched ... Those are perfect examples of the kind of things that a future programmer must learn to figure out by themselves. While I don't argue that the pupil has to necessarily find that out from the first time, I strongly believe it is not up to the tutor to point it out.<p>To a certain extent, the role of ""introductory"" tutorials aiming at teaching programming, should be a way to filter potential programmers and select the best from the ones who won't make it. Teaching programming is similar to Martial Arts in the sense that the best teachers are the ones who let their students struggle before earning an achievement.<p>I can safely assume most of us here found out the ""backspace in browser"" issue (as well as ""unmatched quote"" one) without having the solution pointed out to us. We played, tinkered and experimented. This is how we got where we are today.<p>Holding a student by the hand is not doing him a favor. Often, it's simply delaying his giving up.

As it is, they can pass what they want and nobody is responsible. That's clearly not the way the system was designed to work. The entire purpose of representative democracies is that while representatives can freely vote against their constituents, the constituents also can throw them out of office based on the representative's decisions.<p>I've seen this same problem play out in a variety of contexts, and it looks to me like the line-item veto is the only thing that will prevent this corruption of the system we're seeing. While this idea has been a pet cause of conservatives for some time, it looks like supporters of liberty have just as much or more skin in the game as fiscal hawks.<p>Play out the following scenario in your head: it's late in the year, no budget has been passed by Congress (again), and suddenly some third-rail social program is running out of money. Congress passes a law to help the orphans and grandmothers, everybody climbs on-board with huge majority votes, and way in the back section is another version of SOPA.<p>If you're the president, what do you do? Note this is a much different political scenario than just threatening a veto -- this is asking if you're willing to risk pissing off huge special interests groups just to make a much smaller number of nerds happy. It's political math, and it works quite simply. You sign the bill, make a public speech about how bad the new SOPA is, and life goes on. If you're smart you send out mailers asking people to donate so you can get rid of the thing you just signed! One party will pick the ""side"" of SOPA, the other party will pick the other ""side"". In fact it doesn't matter whether you really support or oppose the bill, whoever paid for it got it passed, huge numbers of politicians got to oppose it, and the public can't point the finger at anybody. There's nobody to throw out of office. There's no feedback loop. The system is broken.<p>In my mind the only thing that is going to fix that is the line-item veto. A lot of state governors have it.

What I will disagree with is that braces are completely free. I believe that code which is vertically succinct is a good thing. It allows you to see more context at once which is particularly useful with well designed, well structured short methods and classes. I've always been opposed to excess white space, like the random blank lines within methods that programmers seem to put arbitrarily with no rhyme or reason, other than their personal aesthetics of course. Also spaces around arguments, putting the opening brace on it's own line (which I find terribly redundant anyone can see when a block has started).<p>I've always liked the K&R style aesthetically, but again I'll agree that Zed has found a decent example of where not using braces just because you can is taken too far.",1326730058

For web graphics, it has all I need. For print, I still (have to) use PS.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/image-manipulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/image-manipulation/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pixelmator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pixelmator.com/</a>",1326729905

My list was similar to Andrew's with a few more clothing items.<p>I should write a blog post but DL;DR version is that it was well worth it. I don't want to live that way continuously but it made me think a lot more about consumerism.<p>For the most part I lived in hostels and cooked my own food. My living expenses stayed about the same since I wasn't paying rent or maintaining a car.<p>The biggest problem with owning so few items is convenience. You sacrifice the convenience of doing laundry once a week (or less) and having everything you need at hand.",1326729856

Outside of a major emergency, taking an extra 15 seconds to get your cellphone, wallet, and key's would probably would probably be worth it, come home and your house is on fire just let it burn.

I'd been taking a more active interest in the area, this was an easier way for me to digest a whole load of tweeters. I redesigned it this weekend to make it a little cleaner and faster (slow queries!), and added a Twitter front end to tweet stories that have had a certain amount of retweets.<p>See the site (or ask!) if you want a little more info on how it works.<p>Submitting now (following the redesign) as some of you may find it as useful as I do.

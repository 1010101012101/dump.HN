428929,comment,428489,428751,0,0,anonymous-c,,,"I received a government polygraph test over a year ago.<p>A mock interrogation would not be very effective. The most important
aspect of a polygraph is leverage. There has to be an incentive for the
person being questioned (e.g. they want an out for committing a crime)
so that they <i>want</i> to tell the examiner the truth. There should also be
a real fear of failing the test. Your brother questioning you about who
stole the cookie from the cookie jar wouldn't cut it.<p>As far as I can tell, the goal of the test is to make you spill your
guts. You might consider yourself confident or be a pathological liar,
but when you're <i>afraid</i> of lying, your body will react to it. It's a
very unique experience and I don't think practicing lying or rehearsing
your responses would be useful. They'll dwell on questions that they
think you're trying to deceive them on and ask you over and over. Each
time, you'll give them a little more (""well, one time, but I didn't
inhale!"") to get them off your back. They'll do the good cop/bad cop
routine and occasionally storm out of the room. Eventually, hours later,
you'll crack and think, ""fuck it, I've already told them this much, might
as well give them the rest."" At that point, you're probably crying or
look pretty distraught so they know they've got
everything.",1231657032

And, of course, it is my first preference for <i>most</i> server scenarios.<p>That said, my opinion is that it's a near failure as a desktop OS.<p>I have Ubuntu installed on my Dell laptop and have had it on there for about a month.  It's certainly usable, and I certainly get my work done in it, but it always feels like I'm using something that has been duct taped together.  Everytime I climb back aboard my Mac Pro at work, it feels like I just took a shower.<p>For starters, X has to go the way of Quartz.  I still can't get this laptop to play full screen video at a decent frame rate.  No problem when I dual boot into Windows.  No problem when I had hackintosh installed on this laptop.  Why is this so hard?  It's not the decoding, it's the drawing.<p>Basic shit like window ornamentation is always ""almost there"" and it frustrates me that it isn't ""there"".  It's like the uncanny valley of UI, this linux desktop.<p>Compviz is cool, but feels cheap and has all kinds of redraw issues.<p>Most of the free replacements for professional tools feel like they're designed by people with severe visual disabilities.  Froo, you are in for a rude awakening thinking you can replace photoshop with Gimp, even Gimp 3.0 is still a long shot away.<p>Thankfully, I can get my work done in a full screen terminal for most of it, Eclipse for the rest.<p>That's my opinion after using it for a month.

428924,comment,428785,428785,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"As an engineer and an ex-libertarian that managed to (thankfully) outgrow it, I have to say that what you describe isn't actually libertarianism as practised and understood by libertarians at large, but your own personal interpretation of it. Is is actually somewhat close to my current views and I would never call myself a libertarian, nor would libertarians call me one of them.<p>You seem to believe in a weak central government and strong state governments that try new approaches and get shit done. This is nice, except most libertarians believe in weak governments in <i>all</i> levels of government. No, not a government that works as well, not an efficient government, but a <i>minimal</i> government.<p>As an example, take the health care debate. Compared to some european countries with good healthcare systems, the US spends substantially more (~15% vs ~9% of GDP) covers substantially fewer people (the millions without coverage) and the overall health of the population is poorer. By nearly all objective measures, a good public system is much better than an all-private system and yet, we know this is not compatible with libertarian ideology - you will have to search far and wide to find a libertarian group that supports a public healthcare system.<p>Like I mentioned above, the libertarian ideology is one of <i>minimal</i> government, which is sometimes, but not always the best type of government. This is why libertarianism relies on simplistic catch-allisms (government=bad, regulation=bad, private-good) and parodies of reality like Atlas Shrugged and other Ayn Rand fiction-pseudo-philosophy writings and not your idealistic ""engineering and scientific assessment of reality"" idea.",1231656940

There is no good reason to expect external cost problem to be worse under a genuinely free market than they are now. So libertarians needn't say much about the issue.<p>And anyway, what do you expect libertarians to say about it?  Either one can say that Government is the answer, or isn't. Libertarians are exactly the people who have knowledge about why Government is bad at solving problems, so they are the last people you'd expect to want the Government trying to solve this one.",1231656260

428900,comment,428785,428855,0,0,anthonyrubin,,,"You need to break these problems down further.<p>Let's take Citibank.<p>The government is involved in changing behavior right from the inception of a corporation. It is called limited liability. We as a society accept this as we believe it encourages people to take more risks. It used to be that a corporate charter could be revoked if it were decided that the company was somehow harmful to the public. I am unaware of the last time this has actually occurred.<p>The government also encouraged risky behavior through GSEs (Freddie and Fannie). There was an implication that the government would take care of things when they went bad.<p>I personally believe that all of these problems are exacerbated by large public companies. Other than the possibility of having to find another job there is generally little risk in performing poorly or even maliciously at an individual level. Those at the top likely make enough money to survive a lifetime if they were fired tomorrow.<p>Now let's shift to the issue of energy.<p>Every drop of fuel you put in your vehicle is subsidized by the government. We spend trillions of dollars to fight wars in order to secure energy resources. These costs are externalized through taxes and it is thus feasible to drive vehicles which are not fuel efficient.<p>I have only scratched the surface on these two issues. I'm not advocating abolishing all regulation and government institutions. I do wish for more discussion which considers the effects that the government has on society.

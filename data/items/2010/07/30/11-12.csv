Every time another story of Apple randomly booting an app from the store came out, the whole team quaked. The idea that we could do all this work and then Apple could deny the app, or even keep it in limbo forever, made us second- or third-guess every design decision. “Will this pixel hurt our chances of getting accepted?”<p>Apple is killing the creativity of their developers with the uncertainty of their App store policies. We made it through okay, thankfully, but I can only wonder about how much more interesting the store would be if Apple had given developers a clear list of rules, and promised to stick to it. The Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt people have about the App Store was entirely optional – Apple brought it on itself, and it’s not going away.""<p>=================<p>Totally spot on.  I'm not even in the iphone/ipad development space (yet?) but among the people I run with who are, that's a big question mark for them, and something which is feeding in to the Android hype (rightly or wrongly).  Whether Android is a better platform for a particular need is coming second to ""there's no one to arbitrarily deny our app distribution"" (assuming nothing illegal or malicious still).  Yes, that's still balanced out with 'there's more money in the Apple ecosystem' but that might not hold true forever.<p>With magcloud, there's no guarantee that the next update version will be accepted, or the next one, or whatever.  Based on the reports we've read from others, magcloud might use an icon that Apple reviewers don't like, and magcloud v2 on the ipad might not be accepted.  Insanely arbitrary, and Apple will need to do a lot to win back the trust of devs who have defected (assuming there's anything they ever <i>could</i> do to win it back).",1280490891

Sharps emphasize rising pitch and flats emphasize falling pitch, and can thus be bent slightly higher and lower, respectively.

1560747,comment,1555589,1558322,0,0,sqrt17,,,"There's several central ideas in CS that most people know. (Not everyone knows every single of them, but most people know many of them). One of them is the idea of finite-state automata. If you have a finite set of strings, or a regular language, you can build a DFA to recognize that.<p>Once you know know about DFAs, and you realize that there are only finitely many words that have a Levenshtein distance of less than k, it's just a question of (i) practicality and (ii) technical details. But when you have the idea to combine concepts X and Y, you know what terms to search for and what papers you want to look at.<p>As to practicality, there's potentially many words that have a Levenshtein distance of at most two for some word, but you don't care about the bits that are different, so the automaton is much smaller.<p>Part of being a successful CS background is to know all the kinds of hammers that are around and having a feel for the right hammer to use given a particular nail.<p>In this case, the hammers are abstractions. Algorithms are fundamentally driven by abstractions into which you then fill necessary technical detail - getting the technical details wrong may leave you with a correct but inefficient algorithm at worst (but enable you to recognize a more efficient way when you come across it), whereas you're bound to reinvent a new duct-taped makeshift wheel wherever you go when you don't know the right abstractions.",1280488896

From rock solid software and physically neigh indestructible phones that you could operate in the dark with one hand we've gone to phones that take 5 minutes to switch on, frequently crash and drop calls and explode in to a variety of parts (cover plates, batteries, main boards, buttons and so on) with normal use and that require the memorisation of insane menu structures to use.<p>What a waste of a very good brand image.",1280488875

If I'm using Django, it won't work (or work well) with a non-rel backend. If I'm using jQuery and I need to update one of the libraries (say jQuery UI) I might have to update jQuery as well, etc.<p>What you think saves oodles of times doesn't always. The odd bug, the odd crash etc that keeps popping up may have roots in the framework that you chose and that you're using without having knowledge of its internals. The framework might make your app much slower and cost you in terms of hardware.<p>Not using a framework is harder work initially, but with the right libraries it isn't that big of a leap. Picking up a smaller framework with libraries can be a surprisingly easy and a lot more flexible when your needs end up being different from what the framework intended.<p>Ofcourse, there is a flip side to it all and I understand your point :) Micro-frameworks are the best IMO, not the beasts that Rails/Django are.",1280487927

5440277,comment,5438965,5438965,1,0,tzs,,,"> Again, context matters: youre not just hanging out at a bar drinking with your buddies, chatting up the attractive woman sitting next to you. Youre at an industry function, talking to women who are your industry peers. Theyre simply not there to be hit on  even in ways that might not be creepy in another setting.<p>Wait a second. Is the bar reserved by the conference organizers for the exclusive use of conference attendees? Or is this just the regular bar at the conference hotel, open to not only conference attendees, but attendees of other concurrent events there, and open to individual hotel guests there as not part of an event, and open to anyone who cares to wander in off the street?<p>If the latter, then I can't agree with some blanket rule against asking someone about considering a romantic relationship. Quite a lot of people, of all sexes, genders, and orientations, want romantic partners who are their peers, but must exclude the possibility of such partnerships with their co-workers because of the problems that can cause in their work place. Many such people (of all sexes, genders, and orientations) congregate at parties and bars at conferences because those are one of the few occasions to meet peers in a social situation that allows seeking romantic partnerships.<p>Use common sense. People who are at the bar because they have switched from ""conference"" mode to ""social"" mode and are looking to meet new people for social purposes should be distinguishable from people who are at the bar because they wanted to find a place that they could drink while they continued discussing the subject of the conference. The former should not ask the latter for dates. When in doubt, play it safe and don't ask.",1364252356

5440275,comment,5440221,5440221,2,0,jseliger,,,"There's also an interesting book discussing this called <i>The Origins of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution</i> by (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Origins-Sex-History-Sexual-Revolution/dp/1846144922?ie=UTF8&tag=thstsst-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Origins-Sex-History-Sexual-Revolution/...</a>), in which he notes, for example:<p><i>""Nowadays the idea that one should follow one's conscience when wrestling with ethical problems seems simple and straightforward. Already by 1750 it could be taken for granted: 'that every man should regulate his actions by his own conscience, without any regard to the opinions of the rest of the world, is one of the first precepts of moral prudence,' noted Samuel Johnson. Before 1700, however, it constituted a direct repudiation of conventional thinking about the inherent corruption of humanity and the fallibility of private scruples. To make sincerity the final judge of sinfulness was to bypass the essential duty of informing one's self adequately, of seeking truth and taking responsibility for error. It unjustifiably presumed that individual men and women could judge right and wrong for themselves, without the aid of scripture, laws, or teachers. It even implied that moral norms might be relative.</i><p>Men were seen as being better able to control themselves than women.",1364252346

Will they support you in the low times and not try to screw you in the high times? If you think this will happen if you take money from your particular friends and family, then inuhj's advice is solid.<p>But it sounds more like expectations weren't managed. If you haven't told your investors how you're going to spend their money that is your fault for not telling them and treating your investors how they should be treated.  Every investment dollar should have a purpose. (Yes, treat your friends and family like investors. Not like family. If you treat them like family who gave you money, they'll treat you like family who took their money, as in inuhj's example.)<p>The golden rule of raising from friends and family: If you're trading on relationship, then you put the relationship at risk.

As with an angel investor, they need to be willing and ABLE to lose every penny they put in.  TELL THEM THAT. If they have a problem, or you sense a problem, don't take their money.<p>This then blur's the line between ""friends & family"" and ""angels.""

  MariaDB is a fork of MySQL maintained in the open. The development
  environment is so much better than what has become of MySQL AB since
  Oracle took over Sun. They deal with security issues in a much better
  manner and don't try to hide the tickets or any details regarding the
  issues. Bugs are fixed much quicker and tickets in general are dealt
  with in a much better manner. MariaDB 5.5 will replace the current
  MySQL 5.1 port for the next release.

We want to avoid the situation, years down the road., where we are faced with having to make a decision to either cope with a bad language mechanic or deal with it by introducing backwards incompatible changes that break gopher's code. Both options suck, and the only good option is to avoid the situation entirely by making sure we make the best design choices.<p>""or get used to having it grow organically like every other language.""<p>Most languages dont grow organically.

Go on the other hand does grow organically, atleast it has so far.

If the banning is purely percentage based then a viable business would be to create an entity that laundered AdWords spend. This is how it would work.<p>Let's call our company ""Ads-r-us"" and it contracts with Knife Depot and 1-800 Flowers. It charges Knife Depot a 'premium' to get its 'ban-inducing ads' and it charges 1-800-Flowers a discount because its ads are ""clean."" It structures the premium and the discount such that there is a bit of cream in the middle for it to keep. Then our entity goes off and buys Ad insertions at various bid points. Knife Depot can advertise forever since there is no risk of them being banned because Ads-R-Us is keeping the percentages in check.<p>I looked around for these guys, I don't see them. (And as a web search engine they aren't talking to me either). So either they don't exist (which I reason is unlikely given how much thought people put into 'scamming' the advertising business on internet ads) or such a scheme wouldn't work.

The first is some bureaucratic red tape within Google, where some employee made a poor decision and no one has corrected it yet.

Correct or not, AdWords is counting those as prohibited, the allegation of the OP is that AdWords banning criteria are applied differently to large accounts. I'm suggesting that the criteria is applied _exactly the same_, based on a percentage.<p>What I'm describing is also how Google Product Listing Ads get moderated: if X% of your items are in violation, your account is automatically shut down, pending appeal.

Am I on target?""), you're not only saying to everyone ""I'm willing to publicly humiliate you, too"", but you're also saying something which can easily be misconstrued as ""I need your validation because I'm a bit unsure of myself"" and leaving yourself wide open to revolt from the team with the validating questions. Just one or two disgruntled employees can cause things to spin rapidly out of control.<p>Instead, when I have a situation like this I take Ted privately off to the side and say ""Ted, I expect X, but I saw that you did Y. Why is that?""<p>When said appropriately, Ted might say ""actually, I did Y because of Z"" and then if you find out that Ted had a good reason to see the situation differently, you didn't just charge in guns-a-blazin' to publicly humiliate him only to make an ass out of yourself (I've seen this happen more than once).<p>If you're good at your job, Ted is usually wrong, so you explain to Ted why X is important and the consequences of Y and work to eliminate the underlying problem (which may very well be Ted himself). Once your team learns that you're willing to hear them out but you're going to take corrective action when needed, you can earn their respect. Publicly humiliating them by calling them out in a team meeting, however, is completely unprofessional.",1364249004

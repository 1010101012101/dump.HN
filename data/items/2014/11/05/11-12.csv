8561391,comment,8557958,8557958,0,0,bane,,,"This is a great and brave article. I&#x27;m a white male. As a young child I grew up in a poorer city apartment complex and most of the time, of all the children there I&#x27;d be 1 or 2 of 30 or 40 kids who was white or a native English speaker. I can&#x27;t say I was ever a &quot;minority&quot; there, because <i>everybody</i> was a minority there. Looking back, I&#x27;m amazed that we were ever able to organize any games to play because so few of us all spoke the same language.<p>Perhaps due to this, I always felt <i>most</i> comfortable in that kind of ultra-diverse environment. When I was older my family moved to a very rural, very white area, and I <i>never</i> quite got comfortable with it. These days, when I visit one of the ultra-diverse North-East American cities, D.C., Philly, NYC, or even London, I can almost feel my inner self relaxing. Even though my take on it is different, in that sense I understand the author&#x27;s feelings about Oakland, you feel most relaxed in the environment you grew up in.<p>Still, diversity is quite hard. In my professional life I&#x27;ve tried to adopt a policy that&#x27;s a little different than many diversity programs. Many programs want you to be &quot;diversity-blind&quot;, meaning you strive to have a mix of people from different backgrounds, but then you ignore that difference. I fundamentally disagree with this. I think you should strive for diverse backgrounds, but then recognize and celebrate people&#x27;s differences. Respect them for who they are and where they come from.<p>I know that this is difficult to do sometimes for a couple reasons:<p>a) some people may be doing what the author was doing and desperately trying to fit in, recognizing that they are different runs counter to their effort<p>b) we come into this with lots of our own perceived biases and stereotypes which can color the <i>way</i> we&#x27;re trying to recognize people&#x27;s differences<p>I think that a) is the biggest problem we need to overcome as a society. Of course there&#x27;s a measure of &quot;fitting&quot; in to any group dynamic that an individual has to do, but when the balance swings too far in the group&#x27;s favor, that individual loses their own uniqueness and their own identity and like the article discusses, it&#x27;s ultimately stressful and damaging to that person.<p>b) is also a problem, and despite growing up in a pluralistic childhood environment, I <i>still</i> have my own biases and stereotypes that I bring into a relationship with anybody. For example, though I grew up in an immigrant heavy neighborhood, I never met and know somebody from South Asia (India, Pakistan, etc.) until I was well into high school. I have a personally broken model about people from these places that I&#x27;m working to improve.<p>Still, I think the effort of overcoming these kinds of biases makes us better people in the end, and makes a better environment for our co-workers and friends. We can recognize people for who they are and what they can bring to the table <i>both</i> as an individual, and as a representative of the group and culture they feel they&#x27;re naturally part of.<p>Some anecdotes I chew on that have stuck with me:<p>- An old coworker, white, male, grew up in a military town and hung around with the self-described hip-hop crowd, his wife is East Asian, feels like he&#x27;s understanding and sympathetic on diversity. I overheard him telling a black coworker that he feels that there&#x27;s really no more racism in the U.S. and that any perceived racism is brought onto people by themselves. My black co-worker tolled him that just the day before he and his brother were driving around town, at the speed limit (he&#x27;s a careful driver) and were pulled over and searched for drugs with no probable cause. He called it &quot;driving while black&quot;.<p>- My wife is Korean, at a company she used to work at, she started coming under aggressive sexism and racism from a new CTO. She fought back against it (and became deeply, deeply depressed through the battle until she quit the job). At one point, with HR present, the CTO said &quot;I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;re this upset about things, I thought Asian women were more demure and subservient.&quot;<p>- Another old co-worker, black, pointed out to my work group one day that he&#x27;s immensely proud of hip-hop and other black music and culture because of the oversized impact it&#x27;s had on American culture. His statement has caused me to reevaluate and rethink and see many culturely American things through this lens.",1415188067

8561385,comment,8543866,8556284,0,0,gfrancis,,,"If you feel that the conclusion of the individual bias results are not convincing, then you probably should not trust the estimated base rate from the analysis of the Psych Science articles. I think the results are convincing, and I am not sure why you say there will be a high false discovery rate (false discovery means concluding bias when it does not exist - a Type I error). If bias does not exist, then (in the ideal case where true experimental power is known) the Type I error rate is 0.1. When power is estimated from the data, the Type I error rate is generally much smaller than 0.1.<p>As for a conclusion of bias being &quot;strong&quot;, I think we have to define the term. Certainly I would not suggest that a conclusion of bias means that authors are being dishonest or stupid. There are many ways for published results to become biased. However, I think the appearance of bias does mean that scientists should be skeptical about the validity of the reported results. The impetus is on the original authors to provide good support for their theoretical ideas, and biased data generally do not provide such support.<p>The closest example I know of that relates to your description of contrasting registries and published results is a comparison of theses and subsequent journal articles.

8561367,comment,8557958,8559914,0,0,GardenQuality,,,"While being a long term hn lurker, I finally decided to create an account to post because I think my life experience might have something interesting to contribute to this discussion.<p>While I understand your questions about the end goal of diversity, I feel differently about the benefits people get from it.<p>> Perhaps the value of diversity is not diversity itself, but rather having a selection of possible groups into which a new hire might chose to integrate?<p>Here I disagree. While it might be an improvement for people  to have an option of a group to self-segregate with - I really do feel that having true meaningful relationships with people of diverse backgrounds (across what ever dimension you are considering) provide tremendous value. I know it sounds a bit like a TV Public Service Announcement, but allow me to give a bit of background.<p>To me it is natural. I grew up in NYC - a fairly diverse city. I went to a somewhat diverse high school. Throughout most of my life, the majority of my friends have been of different races (black, white, latino, asian,..), religions (christian, jewish, muslim, buddhist, hindu), wealthy, poor.... I&#x27;ve been surrounded by interracial, interethnic, interreligious marriages and honestly thought little of it.  It wasn&#x27;t until I left nyc for college and afterwards for work, that I realized how rare my life experiences were. At that point I realized how different the average persons&#x27;s life - and how it usually consisted of them being around people that were fairly similar to them.  And it&#x27;s not that there aren&#x27;t tons of self-selecting self-similar groups in nyc (because like everywhere in the world of course there are and it&#x27;s the norm); it was that normal life consisted of so continuously moving between different homogeneous and different diverse groups that people understood what it was like to be both in the majority and in the minority - as well as connect with people who were in either.<p>One example for me was baseball. In middle school, in the span of 3 years I played on 3 different mostly homogeneous baseball teams. An essentially all black little league team one year where I was in the majority, followed by an essentially all latino little league team (a different neighborhood) followed by an essentially all white middle school team. Between the three teams: The first I was a member of the homogeneous group, the second had a different racial minority be the homogeneous group, and the third had the societal majority group be the homogeneous group. All three were different experiences, but in the end... it&#x27;s all baseball.<p>The baseball experience and others like it give you a different view of group social dynamics and people you are different from. One other notable point in my life that shaped my views on diversity and acceptance came during my later high school and early college years.  It was through interactions with a generalized group of people.  In nyc at the time people usually pejoratively referred to them as &quot;bridge and tunnelers&quot; (a term I never particularly cared for). What I saw of them, they were suburbanites living mostly in new jersey or long island who commuted into nyc to party on weekends.  If I had to make a generalization comparison I would say there was some overlap with what people think of as the &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;, but actual real normal people and not absurd reality tv caricatures. So it was a group I hadn&#x27;t interacted with much previously, but as I started hanging out with friends a night a bit more, began to interact with them some more through friends of friends or random city encounters.  There was something about them that I didn&#x27;t like - but I couldn&#x27;t understand why. It was very rare I would have a dislike for a generalized group of people, and am usually pretty easily able to relate to people individually regardless of what particular background they were, but I knew from trying that I couldn&#x27;t successfully relate to them in conversation. Not that we couldn&#x27;t have a conversation, but that it didn&#x27;t feel like a natural conversation, at best just a superficial interaction. I was too young to understand at the time, but I realized later in life my issue with the was that they didn&#x27;t play by the rules that new yorkers did.<p>My view of the rules was that people meet, they have differences, they find commonalities and connect over it.  But they didn&#x27;t seem to do that. They had a specific sub-culture and the implicit rule was that to connect with one of them you needed to match their sub-culture. There was no real sharing, no common ground, no meet in the middle. It was connect by adhering to their sub-culture or not connecting.  And when differences were noted if was often with derision (ex. A version of the &quot;You actually like that food {blah} of {insert ethnic group here} it&#x27;s so {weird/smelly/...}&quot;). And I don&#x27;t mean that they were mean or bad people, or had any form of malice - my conclusion was simply that their values were shaped by being around people who were always very similar to them.  It&#x27;s the exact same way that a new yorker upon meeting someone might comment &quot;You&#x27;re actually a Boston Red Sox fan? That&#x27;s ridiculous - they&#x27;re a terrible franchise.&quot; (side note, people&#x27;s views on sports for whatever reason are somewhat stickier and less accepting than other areas of their lives). It&#x27;s a comment in ny that probably a lot of people wouldn&#x27;t think twice about because they&#x27;re surrounded by so many people who think similarly. It&#x27;s not a negative marker of who they are, it&#x27;s simply that they&#x27;ve essentially been around people who mostly hold similar views.  (And, btw if you happen to be one of those new yorkers who hasn&#x27;t left the city, spend some time outside of the city and you&#x27;ll be shocked to find out how much of the rest of the country can&#x27;t stand the Yankee&#x27;s. Especially when they were winning.)<p>So for that Yankee&#x27;s fan, I think the best thing is for them to spend some time outside of new york. Have lots of conversations where people discuss the yankees before they know you&#x27;re a fan. Hear them talk about their team.  Afterwards the Yankees fan doesn&#x27;t have to feel guilty about rooting for the Yankees, nor feel they need to root for them any less. But sitting in an airport on the west coast having a conversation with someone it might be a bit easier for them to say  &quot;I realize you&#x27;re an SF Giants fan, and I&#x27;m a Yankees fan, but we can still find stuff to connect over because... hey it&#x27;s baseball.&quot;<p>So this post has gone on long enough. I could write a ton more, but I feel that I&#x27;ve made my points as best as I could.  I truly feel that having meaningful relationships with a diverse group of people in all aspects of life is one of life&#x27;s greatest benefits and should be the goal in itself. And I felt the need to share this because I&#x27;ve realized as I&#x27;ve aged that this might be something that some people may not know due to simply not having the opportunity to experience it first hand. If the only thing you&#x27;ve experienced is &quot;diversity day&quot; style diversity, or &quot;token diversity&quot; I could completely see the desire to look for the purpose of diversity vs. seeing it as the actual goal.<p>I could make an analogy to diversity of knowledge of programming languages.  If a person sees learning a second programming language as an exercise in &quot;I should &#x27;know&#x27; a second language because I&#x27;ll be more marketable&quot;, or &quot;because someone told me it&#x27;s good&quot; and spends a week or so looking into it they may not find it extremely beneficial in and of itself.  But learning and gaining meaningful experience in functional programming the first time is a really self-benefiting task. Even if you never use it professionally, or even if you never use it again, the ideas you are exposed to in a language like Lisp or Haskell change the way you program and think in your language of choice. Diversity of views _is_ the benefit.<p>My final thoughts are this. If you&#x27;ve ever traveled to a foreign country and stayed with with a family where you barely spoke the language, didn&#x27;t know the culture, had never tried the food but were completely welcomed like family it&#x27;s an amazing experience and anyone who has experienced it will agree. That is what being inclusive and accepting of people who are different looks like - they accepted you. That type of acceptance in the presence of difference is what the model of successful diversity looks like to me.",1415187090

Readability for the &quot;why&quot;<p>All human-readable description in code is there to make the difference between having a piece of documentation pointing you in the right direction, and having to reverse engineer your understanding. It&#x27;s an optimization problem with definite tradeoffs. Although CS professors and many tutorials will tend to encourage you towards heavy description, over-description creates space for inconsistent, misleading documentation, which is worse than &quot;not knowing what it does.&quot;<p>When you see code that is dense and full of short variables, it&#x27;s written favorably towards modification. It is relying on a summary comment for &quot;what&quot; it does, and perhaps on namespaces, scope blocks, or equivalent guards to keep names from colliding. Such code lets you reach flow state quickly once you&#x27;ve grokked it and are ready to begin work, because more of it fits onscreen, and you&#x27;re assured the smallest amount of typing and thus can quickly try and revise ideas. The summary often gets to stay the same even if your implementation is completely different. And if lines of code are small, you enjoy a high comments-to-code ratio, at least visually.<p>Code that builds in the &quot;what&quot; through more descriptive variable names pays a price through being a little harder to actually work in, with big payoffs coming mostly where the idea cannot be captured and summarized so easily through a comment.<p>In your example, one might instead rework the whole layout of the code so:<p><pre><code>    var urq; /* user request type */\n\n    ... (we build list &quot;l&quot;) \n    \n    /* adjustments for user request */\n    {\n      if (urq==&quot;rns&quot;) { /* case sensitive sort by reverse alphabetical order */ ... }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf you aren&#x27;t reusing the algorithm, inline and summarize. And if you&#x27;re writing comments about &quot;what the upper layer expects&quot;, then you(or your team) spread and sliced up the meaning of the code and created that problem; that kind of comment isn&#x27;t answering a &quot;why,&quot; it&#x27;s excusing something obtuse and unintuitive in the design, and is a code smell - the premise for that comment is hiding something far worse. If the sequence of events is intentionally meaningful and there&#x27;s no danger of cut-and-paste modifications getting out of sync, it doesn&#x27;t need to be split into tiny pieces. Big functions can be well-organized and easy to navigate just with scope blocks, comments, and a code-folding editor.<p>&quot;Why&quot; is a complicated thing. It&#x27;s not really explainable through any one comment, unless the comment is an excuse like the example you gave. The whole program has to be written towards the purpose of explaining itself(e.g. &quot;literate programming&quot;), yet most code is grown organically in a way that even the original programmers can only partially explain, starting with a simple problem and simple data and then gradually expanding in complexity. Experience(and unfamiliar new problem spaces) eventually turns most programmers towards the organic model, even if they&#x27;re aware of top-down architecture strategies. Ultimately, a &quot;why&quot; has to ask Big Questions about the overall purpose of the software; software is a form of automation, and the rationale for automating things has to be continuously interrogated.",1415185851

A lot of people simply cannot afford to lose their job, whereas pretty much every employer can afford to fire almost any individual. This means people are willing to work for little pay, poor benefits and no vacation because they are effectively forced to, even though everyone would be better off if everyone was forced to take vacation",1415185670

They get a warrant, bust down the door and go inside. How do you think they get internal business documents when prosecuting white collar fraud?

If they hurt themselves on the job, they can count on universal health care.

279943,comment,279907,279928,0,0,yawn,,,"It's pretty obvious that he's new to mobile development.  The first thing to understand is that the carriers completely control the playing field.  It's incredibly frustrating trying to write an app across multiple devices let alone multiple carriers.  Hardware on one device may be very easy to work with on one carrier, yet a complete pain in the rear on another carrier.  They just have to get their hands on things and make adjustments.<p>Certification is also way more painful than it needs to be on some carriers.  Access to some portions of the APIs are blocked by the carriers unless certified by the carrier.  The certification process can be very painful if you do not have elevated status inside the carrier.<p>We have had problems getting GPS to work reliably on a specific popular line of smart phones with a specific carrier.  The GPS on the same devices works perfectly on other carriers.  This kind of stuff happens at all levels of the API.<p>Welcome to mobile development.",1219114090

I want people who have seen where the web could be going and who are dedicated to guiding it there. I want the woman who knows when less is more, and when more is more. I want the man who understands how the future of discussion on the web is being shaped, and who is obsessed with getting it right.

279931,comment,279680,279761,0,0,sethg,,,"If the company hosting these stats is charging $25K per licensee, then either they're <i>really</i> good at bluffing or their lawyers have made sure that their data is protected in spite of <i>Feist</i>.<p>For example, if they use some kind of clickwrap ""you must consent to this license before you can see our statistics"" page, then the company doing the scraping could be sued for <i>contract</i> violation, even if there's no <i>copyright</i> issue.  So the site owner can't hit you for statutory copyright damages and has to settle for actual damages, i.e., the $25K of license fees that you're not paying, plus attorney's fees, plus whatever else their attorney can think to lather on.<p>And your would-be partner hasn't even set up a corporate veil to protect his personal assets from this kind of exposure?

279928,comment,279907,279907,0,0,sanj,,,"This argument undervalues just how much carriers can undermine the experience.<p>Part of the success of the iPhone is that his Steve-i-ness managed to wrangle concessions out of AT&T that make the iPhone work well.  I'd be surprised if something as simple as ""Visual Voicemail"" will exist anytime soon on Android 'in the wild'.<p>Apple's strength is in an excellent end-to-end experience.  Until Android can come close to matching this, I think the iPhone will continue to rule.<p>Unfortunately (for Android), this isn't about technology.  It is about having leverage over carriers.  And I think that's where the iPhone will continue to win.",1219112653

I think perhaps the fact I'm young so take things for granted and the fact nowadays I see everything as it appears on the internet makes everything seem more like a progression rather than shocking.<p>I do remember visiting Google Suggest and later Google Maps and being very impressed and knowing it would change the web - until that point JavaScript has largely been seen as a toy. Gmail also really changed the landscape when it came out too.<p>The first time I used Opera's tabs in 2000 wasn't ""holy shit"" as much as a ""well, that makes perfect sense"" moment which are even rarer.",1219112336

In regards to the freshness of certain ingredients, like nuts, they rated them superior.  Godiva charges a premium and puts some of that into fancy boxes and marketing.<p>I used to be quite happy programming in C.  Now, I find I am quite spoiled by the absolute dynamic power, full closures, magical seeming debugger, and everything is an Object environment I have in Smalltalk.  I get paid more, but I also ""pay"" a premium in terms of fewer choices in places of employment.<p>Maybe there is some wisdom in choosing just not to know.

If there is a really good teacher which challenges their students then any course can be a great learning experience (even beyond the material covered).  Obviously, it will always be different between schools.  If I were you, I'd ask fellow students to see if anyone has taken a truly interesting/challenging course.<p>I took a Negotiations course my senior year of college and it was easily my favorite class of all time.  There was a lot of roleplaying and class debate, but the teacher played Devil's Advocate and poked holes in everyone's arguments.  He truly required us to think creatively and analyze a situation thoroughly before speaking/writing, or else he'd rip us apart.  It was a breath of fresh air after many other classes were purely focused on learning concepts, rather than applying them creatively.",1295535542

Lacking a full, deep understanding of your tools is almost a bonus a lot of the time. In fact it is necessary to prevent yourself from going too deep into each tool, if you want to successfully create any art. Music is all about results. There are no 'best practices' in art. This is why I keep failing at learning music production, I focus too much on trying to understand what I'm doing and never manage to create any actual music.<p>Understanding this fundamentally alien (to hackers) relationship to complex technology is IMO of paramount importance when marketing tools to musicians. They are already having to struggle to understand so many things, and the successful ones have learned to only dig as deep as they need to in order to realise their visions. Therefore you should be careful when offering them such complex tools, they may not use them the way you expect.<p>They are used to hammering their tools with unexpected inputs and combinations of inputs, until they get out something they like, and then they run with it, with no care whether they are doing it 'right' or not. If it sounds right, then it's right.<p>Understanding this mindset is key to making products for musicians.<p><i>(Disclaimer: This may not apply to other musicians, especially those making 'proper' music. YMMV)</i>",1295535230

If nothing, understanding basic design principles will allow you to creatively contribute to a designer at some later date.<p>* Learn at least one new language.

Personally, I wish I learnt German (I'm Indian and I find German a lot similar to Hindi and other Sanskrit-derived languages).<p>* Take a course that furthers your hobby: Photography, Art, Snowboarding, Archery and what have you.<p>* Take a course in the biology department.

THERE IS NO REASON FOR THEM TO EVER COME ACROSS IT OTHERWISE.  PLEASE STOP JUDGING A BOOK BY ITS COVER AND JUST SIGN UP.  I'M LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK ON IT'S FUNCTIONALITY, NOT THE PURPOSELY MINIMAL LOGIN PAGE.  SORRY IT'S NOT ANOTHER COOKIE CUTTER STARTUP SITE!<p>EDIT: I'm going to copy and paste a comment I left at the bottom since there's now a good chance it will get overlooked and people will keep posting the same thing (plus it actually already addresses everything you said):<p>I have a feeling I'll get some comments about how its intent isn't immediately obvious but I wanted it to operate like a true application. I am honestly tired of seeing 99% of startups' websites looking like only a slight variation of the last.<p>I've intentially made the initial page is so (seemingly!!) limited so that anyone who visits for the first time is pretty much forced to read what it is (you'll see it if you wait 2-4 seconds!)... and once you know what it is... you know exactly what it is and for that information to remain afterward makes it cluttered. I'm also covering a fairly small niche with the product so most people who visit will know what it is beforehand anyway (by word of mouth - given the nature of the business). You'll notice that if you start typing your name before 2 seconds arrives, the popups telling you what it is don't appear. ;)<p>If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of simplicity and efficiency but with high function. There's a lot more going on with my app than it seems at first glance.<p>I would also like as much feedback as possible regarding the mobile version since I've only been able to test it on a small handful of phones. I'm actually in the process of downloading as many emulators as I can right now.<p>On average I've been putting in 70+ hours a week since July, as I've put it together entirely from scratch. No frameworks whatsoever other than a graphing library and the phpmailer library (more reliable/portable than the native mail function). I think it's time I slow down a little bit and get on with my life... lol... I'm 23 and this is my first startup... and I'm going solo... unfunded... so any guidance in helping this move forwards is GREATLY appreciated!!!<p>And my response to your specific comment:<p>Well... it says it's a video tutorial, not an ad.  The original audio I had for the video actually explained exactly what it is within the first 20 seconds... but I cut it out because 1) I felt it sounded really cheesey and 2) I expect people visiting the site to already know its main function.  It's centered around automatically sending weekly soundscans in PDF form (reports on merch sold at various venues while on tour)... which is a BIG deal for touring musicians, because the current method is a huge pain (all handwritten and faxed).  I expect that they're visiting the site for that reason... but I guess that's a bad assumption.  I really appreciate the feedback though... I'll definitely make its purpose much more obvious.<p>EDIT 2:  I reversed the order of the initial 2 tips so that the ""What is RELA"" tip comes first (instead of the video tutorial), which explains exactly what it does... so there's a MUCH greater chance they'll know what it is before watching the video (and in which case, the video tutorial remains a video tutorial rather than an ad).",1295533898

Watch out for that post here. In the meantime I'm struggling with the name and consequent domain name registration. I really want to use CV, short for Curriculum Vitae for those in the dark, instead of Resume. But I'm not sure whether you guys in the US use CV and Resume interchangeably like we tend to do here in the UK. My tagline will more than likely have the word Resume in it if I do go with CV in the main name. I'm probably making too big a deal of this one word, but I'm concerned about a) recognition of CV by my target market (Silicon Valley tech types like your good selves) b) that Resume has about 10 times the volume of searches in the US vs CV according to SEMRush. So I should probably have resume in the domain name rather than the tagline.<p>Any input that you US readers have on this CV vs Resume debate would be great.

  - better access to more funding

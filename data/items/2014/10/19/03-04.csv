The proper measure of when to cancel a show is not how it compares to its own past, but rather how it compares to what is likely to replace it. The average <i>bottom</i> third of current Simpsons seasons is still better than the typical new Fox show.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see how perceptions of old episodes change. For example, 3F02, &quot;You Only Move Twice&quot;, where Homer goes to work for Hank Scorpio, is seen today as one of the best episodes of the series. On IMDB, it has the lowest rating of season 8.<p>9F10, &quot;Marge vs. the Monorail&quot; is the lowest rated season 4 episode on IMDB, but now is on most of the &quot;best of&quot; lists for the series.",1413691033

The question is whether VR is worth the trouble.  I&#x27;m still not seeing the killer app for this. Hardcore gamers?  Virtual tourism?  Implanting false memories in kids? (The VR group at Stanford has used their system to let kids experience swimming with dolphins. Asked about it a few months later, the kids believe they really did swim with dolphins.)<p>A big problem is that VR has the same problem as gaming - moving and shooting works great, but try to manipulate anything and it sucks.  Early thinking about VR was that it might be easier and more intuitive to do design work in VR than on a 2D screen. Autodesk did some work on this.  Design in VR is like drawing while wearing mittens. No good.<p>Notice that the Oculus Rift crowd totally ignores the input side. The first generation of VR was &quot;gloves and goggles&quot;. Now it&#x27;s just goggles.<p>This may be the biggest dud since 3D TV.",1413690769

8477162,comment,8464532,8470396,0,0,VexXtreme,,,"Ok, I guess we are just going to have to agree to disagree. Our respective systems of values seem to be fundamentally different, because I believe that property rights are sacrosanct and an extension of who we are.<p>In case you&#x27;re curious how I came to that conclusion, here goes: in most cases (not involving criminal situations), private property is basically a store of our previously invested time. We spend a portion of our lives on learning skills and then applying those skills to certain ends, such as making money and acquiring property. If we assume that a human lifetime is finite, then reserving the right to redistribute private property and wealth is basically reserving the right to take the most valuable resource humans have - their time on this Earth.<p>So if I&#x27;m working 10 hours a day and I&#x27;m being taxed some 40% (through a combination of income, property and consumption tax), then it means I am working only 6 hours for myself and my own personal gain, and the remaining 4 hours in fact belong to someone else. Now, I apologize in advance for this loaded language, but to me, that is a form of slavery. No one has the right to demand, at gunpoint, that people give their time and person to an end that they don&#x27;t care about and that doesn&#x27;t directly improve their situation.<p>I feel very strongly about this, to the point where I left my country of birth (a European country with ridiculously high taxes), for a much better place where the taxes are much lower and more reasonable. It&#x27;s a clear example of capital flight, on a smaller scale. I know my opinion is extremely unpopular in this day and age, but it is what it is. To me, strong property rights are some of the most basic human rights, no different than freedom of speech or association.",1413690501

To deal with this variation, each text was matched with its translation in an eighth language, Vietnamese (VI), different from the seven languages of the corpus.

If you store words are 10-bit values, each bit is independent from the other. Let&#x27;s assume if a user makes a mistake the mistaken word value is uncorrelated with the true one. Then parity will only allow error <i>detection</i>, and your method of assuming erasures will simply generate N different correct word hypotheses.<p>Interestingly, if you don&#x27;t need permutation reliability (I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d need it anyway, people create meaning associating the words in the given order), you could use an ECC to achieve M-out-of-N passphrase securely, allowing both erasure and error correction!<p>For example, with 4096 words, you could do 6-out-of-8 words with two errors (or 5-out-of-8 with erasures) by splitting the words in 4 3-bit groups and using a GF(8) Reed-Solomon [2] error correction ([8,5,4] code).

My take on this whole thing is that these array languages (APL, k, J, q) are a perfect fit for things that are essentially arrays - big data, images, etc...\nAnd to those who shy away from the seemingly &#x27;noisy&#x27; syntax, I point them to mathematics. Until you understand the sigma symbols and others, it is noise too.\nWhy are all the new languages getting hot on &#x27;vectorization&#x27; - Julia and company - because GPUs and data are all array-based. To have the array as your lingua franca puts you in a good position for all sorts of attacks on modern computing needs.\nAnd for those who cannot live with the syntax, and say how can you create a dsl - you can. Here is a J example of computing averages:<p><pre><code>  +/%#\n</code></pre>\nYou can set this up as:<p><pre><code>  avg=: +/%#\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  tally =: #\n  divide =: %\n  sumall =: +/\n</code></pre>\nHow&#x27;s that for a dsl? Which allows this now:<p><pre><code>  avg=: sumall divide tally\n  avg 2 4 6\n  4\n</code></pre>\nEDIT: I forgot to add that these operations, as others in J or APL, work on scalars, vectors and arrays without any special typing or handling. See this presentation for at least the first 5 minutes to see J in action with explanation: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/j-language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/j-language</a>\nThe conciseness allows you to start seeing the small patterns in the small expressions just like mathematics, hence bringing clarity and speed of abstraction to your concept manipulations.",1413688249

So when Amazon made this security hole they took some of user tools, namely account-content link.

Twitter. App.net doesn't interoperate with Twitter; it's another, separate silo. There's no guarantees that your Twitter friends will move to App.net with you, which limits the appeal if you live in Twitter.<p>People who hate Twitter hate it for a variety of reasons. App.net doesn't address most of these. If you hate Twitter because they kneecapped their developers, guess what, there's no guarantees App.net won't kneecap their developers five years from now either. If you hate Twitter because it's a centralized, proprietary system, guess what, App.net is centralized and proprietary too. If you hate Twitter because of its scaling problems, guess what, there's no guarantees that App.net (which, as noted, is as centralized as Twitter is) will be any better at dealing with that stuff.

Why not spend the time to tell his story? He gave the judge no opportunity to be lenient.<p>Because nobody cares. Not your defense attorney, not the prosecutor, not the judge, nobody. They see <i>dozens</i> of these sob stories <i>every</i> day. They don't have time for it and they don't care.

Defense Attorney: Just plead guilty, it'll be fine. You: No. Go talk to the prosecutor. Do your job. Get me a plea-bargain <i>in writing</i> and I'll <i>consider</i> pleading guilty. And before you hand me that piece of paper, all of you talk to the judge and make sure everybody is on the same page.<p>Also, every state is different, so make sure to know your local law!

The open-source product does X, but the product from a vendor does X + Y. This is a tempting business model for vendors because you can build feature Y once, then sell it over and over with relatively little additional cost per sale.<p>The other answer is: Trained talent, continuously on tap.<p>If you're a company and you use an open-source product internally, there will be times when you want the advice of an expert. Something has broken and you need help finding the problem. You want to improve performance and you want advice on how. New features have come out in the open-source product and you need someone to explain what they are and how they might benefit your company.<p>What do you do? You can look for free advice online in forums or IRC. But the best advisors don't work for free very often. And those who <i>do</i> work for free won't prioritize your request for help over all the others that flood these kinds of forums. Your company may have tens of thousands of dollars riding on this. You would happily spend many extra dollars to get a definitive answer now. You need a well-connected matchmaker to help you connect your big check with the appropriate talent.<p>You could look for a well-regarded consultant. But identifying the good ones and testing them takes a lot of preparation. Even if your address book has been primed with the contact info of the best consultants, they have backlogs. Just getting them on the phone may be difficult. Worse, what if trouble strikes and you call the consultants and find that they're all booked up, or retired, or they've switched to consulting on iOS development and abandoned your platform?<p>You could find or train a brilliant expert in your open-source tech and then <i>hire</i> them full time to sit around waiting for the need to act. But that's awfully inefficient. And then the expert gets bored playing Tetris all day and gets hired away or goes off to found a startup, and you're back on square one.<p>Enter the support firm. They'll sell you ""support contracts"" (pay advisors/troubleshooters by the hour, with a minimum number of hours per month) or ""professional services"" (pay the developers by the day, week, or project for larger-scale projects than are given to ""support"".

But, people are always coming up with new bots, so it's impossible to apriori block every bot.  So, we are constantly retro-actively checking clicks to make sure they are legit.  For example, if a publisher yields more clicks on a given campaign than we predict, we'll retroactively take a look through a series of methodical checks and in many cases will do a series of manual checks.

We learned an incredible amount about community management, viral marketing, and communication with our users through Likealittle and use those learnings on a daily basis as we develop Circle further.

At times it feels like an impassable chasm.<p>As a similar example, when I was younger I used to cycle a lot. I would go out 4-5 times a week and would cycle as far as I could and as hard as I could. I got to the point where it became frustrating to cycle with any of the people I knew because I was so much faster that I could not get a reasonable workout if I went at their speed.<p>So I figured it was time to take the next step, so I signed up for the youth category of a regional cycle race to see how I would fare there. I remember seeing my competition, who were kids about my age but they had turned up with dedicated vans (embossed with sponsorship logos), support crews, carbon fibre bikes and personal trainers, the works. Many of them were actually the sons of pro cyclists.<p>So I line up at the start and when the gun goes off everyone plows forward, I manage to keep up for a while by working hard and feel pretty good about it. Though after a while it becomes obvious that they were really only just warming up and one by one they start to drop me until I'm stuck right at the back of the race.<p>This put me off cycling for quite a while, because it seemed like the choice was simply between dominating everyone or losing.<p>I sometimes think programming and computer stuff can be similar, everyone knows a kid who is a ""computer genius"" but in reality that can mean anything from knowing how to re-install Windows and fix basic computer problems to someone who hacks on the Linux kernel for fun.",1344280221

Only a small minority of HN can truly <i>identify</i> with those who are in intractable pain; they can understand their plight, but they don't feel it themselves. But when thinking about someone with a great job who was ""on their way to the top"" making one bad (and harmless!) decision, and then losing everything they had worked for because of it, and having to start from scratch with a nearly-indelible black mark on their record--well, I can imagine the mirror neurons of a lot of HNers are firing at that pain.",1344279772

It doesn't sound like he even hired an attorney:<p><i>""The judge who heard James' case accepted the no-contest plea. Then he began stacking on penalties.""</i><p>Were I in this guy's situation, I would not gone to my court date without a lawyer, a plan for getting everything dropped or sealed, and an idea of the worst-case scenario.<p>3.

Still, that's a pretty minor bug considering what a minor deviation from uniformity it causes.<p>Yes, because of the modulo operator and this is not a minor thing in my opinion. Especially with small arrays his implementation will return the the 0th or 1st element much much more often than other elements.<p>I think the correct way would be to use arc4random_uniform(...).<p>> Yeah, this is a common mistake for people making ""additions"" frameworks, and it just strikes me as egotistical.

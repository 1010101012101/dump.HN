The more data points you have, the better a decision you can arrive at, as well as use it as leverage.<p>Just because it's Angel funding doesn't mean that it's necessarily going to be faster, angels are not waiting in tow to give away their money ;-)",1214816215

I think we're (HN) all competent on basic promotion/seo/ads/domains skills IMO. Selling related products, doing custom work and consulting seem to be the most ROI.",1214815983

231827,comment,231758,231820,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I don't think that's 100% true. There are some good new ideas emerging due to new machine models: Erlang for example, which is like the machine language of concurrency. And Haskell wasn't really anticipated by the 70's, nor is much of Fortress -- especially the methods they're using for parallelism.",1214815482
231826,comment,231297,231487,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Indeed, lock-free data structures can be a massive pain to implement. Clojure solves this problem, quite elegantly in my opinion, by making the data structures themselves immutable, any operations yield a new instance of the data structure (with shared substructure of course). You can then update references to the data structure with the new data structure; in Clojure the idiomatic way to do this is using STM transactions, but you could do it with atomic updates or locks in any other language.<p>Presumably, this won't scale especially well with many writers, at least not for trees and hash tables.<p>I surveyed the GC-on-C++ situation a couple of years ago, and nothing was realistically that useful for concurrent applications. Definitely nothing anywhere near as sophisticated as, say, the JVM's garbage collector.",1214815407

231823,comment,231558,231565,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I agree that ticket systems and bug trackers cause some headaches for developers. When you have a problem on the shelf, you're compelled not to think about other things, which may be either nicer, or more important.<p>But there's a lot of value in being able to track things. You don't need a task list loading up your head in the same way, and for a distributed project it's vital for communication purposes.<p>One suggestion might be to have two lists: the central repository for bugs, which get voted on (and the votes diminish over time, like a hacker news of bugs/issues/enhancements). And then for each person, a 'shopping list'.<p>The idea is you don't want to take on too many tickets, because after a while, they go 'bad', like groceries -- they just stay in our fridge and we don't finish them.<p>You also want to be able to judge impact versus the time you think it will take, so you optimize for that -- something like the number of votes divided by the number of hours you think it will take <i>you</i> will give you the priority.<p>Heck, this is actually starting to be a good idea. Maybe I should throw up a little HN clone for tracking, and see how it goes.",1214814725

231813,comment,231678,231678,0,0,DaniFong,,,"One tried and true method is just to schelp your skills to some employer. Open source hacking is usually evidence enough to get you a good job. Sometimes, the project is even strategically important to the company -- Linux and Transmeta, for example.<p>There are a lot of very sane reasons to participate in FOSS, even if you only cared about money. It helps in getting hired. It's terrific technical practice. It builds a large set of technical links not tied to any particular employer, whom you can count on for good advice. It keeps you at the cutting edge of good practices and new technologies. And if you're starting a startup, you can find great developers through it. You can gain major hacker and media cred by open sourcing things.<p>In fact, open source may be one of the only methods, besides hacking with people in college or at work, for finding good cofounders. This is only a hunch, but it's one I'm betting on.<p>The only thing is that you can't immediately make money by that one particular method, but usually it takes a lot of experimentation to find a good business model anyway, and the network effects and the trouble of hosting things is often enough to keep competitors at bay.",1214813702
231812,comment,231621,231757,0,0,narag,,,">Anyway what do you think of marijuana as a stepping stone to heavier drugs?<p>In my experience this is not true. I can remember a numerous group of people that used to join to smoke hashish (here it's the most usual preparation) 25 o 30 years ago. Most of the group is now doing perfectly: architects, engineers, businessmen... only two had any problems, one of them died due to overdose. But it was clear before that something was wrong with both of them. I knew the dead man since childhood and he had something inside that he couldn't control, long before he took any drug.",1214813656

231810,comment,231758,231758,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Alternatively, you can learn macros, as PG might suggest. Fundamentally, compilers just translate one string of symbols into another. The ones we're familiar with just translate a high level language into assembly. But there are others -- every object relational model system has a defacto compiler.",1214813508

231807,comment,231621,231725,0,0,narag,,,">Alcohol is an addictive substance that kills lots of people[1] directly through toxicity and indirectly through impaired judgment.<p>There is strong evidence that red wine is a powerful antioxidant that prevents heart diseases. That'd be ""medicinal ethanol"". I don't find the medicinal argument so ridiculous. Like wine, people has smoked cannabis for a long long time. It isn't toxic and it has several beneficious substances. So why forbid it?<p>>the worst that can happen while stoned is that you waste a lot of time or anger your roommate by eating his cheetos.<p>OTOH, I don't think that's the worst that can happen to you. Heavy frequent use makes people lazy and lose their ""sharpness"", not very good for programmers. And it's still a drug. What you feel while using it isn't real. But I don't even think it's a point against legalization.",1214813031

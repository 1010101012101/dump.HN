And he was pretty good at as well. But having spent my youth on the court I have to say I could never really get the hang of underhand shots. It's Sunday & basketball training is on my mind. The standard shooting technique relies on your lead hand:<p>- assume triple-threat position<p>- holding the ball in the finger tips, fingers extended resting the ball in the palm<p>- the non lead arm rests to the side of the ball, steadying it so it doesn't fall out. It remains in line with the lead arm until the lead arm reaches the chin when releasing the ball.<p>- angle body behind lead foot (so your whole body is aligned towards the ring... extra movement but it straitens the shot)<p>- bringing the ball down to shoulder height, arm crooked<p>- bend knees making sure arm is still rigid<p>- at the bottom of the knee bend, push back up<p>- at the top of the knee-up, push the lead arm upwards brushing the ball past the chin<p>- extend the lead arm pushing it straight upwards, wrist still cocked behind the ball.<p>- almost at the top of the lead arm extension, the wrist is quickly snapped foward releasing the ball with a backwards spin towards the ring.<p>- follow the wrist snap through and make sure the lead arm is pointing forward towards the ring.<p>This is the key to the height the article mentions. If you fail to release the ball it falls short or overshoots. Now the foul-shot is really a pressure shot. If you waiver a bit on the way up, choke and not follow through the lead wrist, you will probably miss.<p><i>""... He was a deadly free-throw shooter, using an odd, outdated underhand style.

And the touch is the hardest to master. I used to warm up standing still, pushing the ball as high as I could controlling where I pushed the lead arm so the ball went straight up. Then move to the side of the key moving away from the ring. Finally to the foul line. You still have to practice your touch to practice your outside/jump shots but at the foul line anything that can improve your percentage should probably be looked at.<p>Here is Barry himself demonstrating his technique ~ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4eJSjwlD5o"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4eJSjwlD5o</a><p><i>""... Of course, lobbing a ball very high so that it comes down nearly straight into the basket would be the most efficient technique, but a shot like that 'is almost impossible to aim' ...""</i><p>That is the weakness of using the standard foul shot. To get the shot up high it is difficult to aim. Not impossible but any wobble going up and lack of follow through to the rim.",1221957761

310148,comment,308332,308803,0,0,dlweinreb,,,"Yes, lisp.org needs to be (and will be) vastly improved. We definitely need the equivalent of a CPAN for Lisp, and several of us are working on producing such a thing.  You're quite about marketing!<p>As for multiple implementations: CPython, Jython, IronPython, Stackless Python, PyPy.  What editor do you use?  Gnu Emacs with Slime; or, some of the commercial Lisp implementations come with IDE's; and there's work being done (""curl"") to make Eclipse work well with Common Lisp.  Java has several IDE's, such as IntelliJ and Eclipse.  For Python, what I'm told by the Python experts I know is that they just don't use any IDE.<p>But much of what you're saying above is very much to the point.  The comments on my blog posting go into these issues more.",1221956906

310146,comment,308332,309070,0,0,dlweinreb,,,"I disagree about that.  It's very, very hard to add Lisp-style macros to something like C or Java.  The best attempt to do it for Java is Jonathan Bachrach's Java Syntactic Extender, but as far as I know nobody has built any software with it.  It's just too hard to use.<p>Until you have read a clear description (e.g. Seibel) or had some experience, it's hard to see what macros are really all about.<p>Lisp macros are extremely important, powerful, and beneficial.  Space does not permit me to go into the full explanation; see Peter Siebel's book and the great lecture he gave at Google, available on the web.<p>Macros allowed us to add object-oriented programming to Common Lisp.  CLOS (the Common Lisp Object System) fits in very smoothly into the Common Lisp language, with a nice, clear syntax and very powerful semantics.  At work, we have built an object-relational mapping system that, similarly, would be impractical (ugly and verbose to the point of unusability) without macros.",1221956429

I think the idea that anyone should be expected to program by using something with the power of Microsoft Notepad is an obsolete view.  GNU Emacs with Lisp mode makes it very easy to work with the parentheses.<p>Meanwhile, we have no ""dangling else"" problem.  Also, we have no need to memorize C's 15 levels of operator precedence, so when you see an expression, you never have to puzzle over how the items are grouped.  In simple cases of C expressions, of course, it's easy, but it can get complicated.  See ""Java Puzzlers"" by Josh Bloch and Neal Gafter to see how C/Java-style syntax can get you into trouble and fool you.  There are pros and cons to each approach (C/Java and Lisp).  I've used all of them extensively, and I prefer the Lisp way.",1221955917

But it is those very same attributes that provide the visual affordance required for users to determine the function they perform. That is, whilst the selection of those attributes, in the beginning, may have been arbitrary, they no longer are. Consistency in application is one of the best ways to pass on knowledge. Whilst blue underlined text doesn&#x27;t have anything that intrinsically suggests its action, consistent application of that visual language builds up the affordance in the user: all blue underlined text is a hyperlink.<p>Look at it this way; at some point in the past someone decided that the highlight on GUI buttons should appear to come from the top-left of the screen. This was a completely arbitrary decision. However, with the rest of the GUI adopting the similar design decision, a cohesive impression is built up. It became obvious to users that this meant that a button was raised and could be clicked with the mouse cursor.<p>But if you design your GUI with the highlight coming from the bottom-right, no matter home much better you think this will improve the GUI and how much more sense it makes, your button will appear to be inset and selected. That is, whilst the selection of those attributes, in the beginning, may have been arbitrary, they no longer are.<p>And so it is with hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are underlined blue text because they are. Unless there is some radical, obvious improvement to be made, any changes to these attributes will be to the users detriment. Most often, these changes are attributed to improving integration with the web page design, introducing cohesiveness, but this is mistaking hyperlinks as elements of the design. They are not, they are UI elements and as such should sit outside the style of the web page.<p>With the politest of respect and IMHO of course :)",1454431177

11020441,comment,11019539,11019859,0,0,mdip,,,"In general, I agree with your points.  In Michigan, with a few exceptions (freeway design limitations/residential roads), the speed limit is supposed to be set at (I think) the 85th percentile.  Effectively -- county/city/township road speeds are set at the speed most drivers are driving.  We&#x27;re strictly set at 70 MPH on freeways with few exceptions for specific freeways not designed to safely travel at those speeds and the limit will soon be raised to 85 MPH for rural freeways.  I&#x27;ve watched the city roads increase speed limits over the last 10 years where I live, which is a busy metropolitan area.  It&#x27;s really quite nice since it&#x27;s less chaotic when everyone is traveling at around the same speeds on the roads.  And it <i>has</i> reduced speeding.<p>I do not speed -- I had received a ticket in my 20s that raised my insurance rates so much that I just don&#x27;t accept the risk.  There&#x27;s a road near my house that practically <i>everyone</i> drove 50 MPH down despite a 40 MPH posted speed limit.  They raised it two years ago to 55 MPH after a traffic survey and as a result, I am no longer passed when I drive at the posted speed.  It&#x27;s an anecdotal account, but I&#x27;m on that road a few times a day many days and it&#x27;s a stark difference.  When the speed limit is set to what people drive, most people stop speeding.<p>That said, residential roads at 25 MPH is a rule that the 85th percentile rule doesn&#x27;t apply to -- for good reason. Parked cars where pedestrians emerge, roads that are not maintained well or cleared for snow/ice, and children who do not have the proper sense to not &quot;run off into the street chasing a ball&quot; all make speeding in subdivisions <i>dangerous</i>.",1454430759

Just because oil is cheap right now doesn&#x27;t mean that people are going to stop working on clean energy and a replacement for petroleum based transportation. It may slow things negligibly but people who are smart enough to be looking into that aren&#x27;t really swayed by the price of a barrel of oil.<p>The Saudis are trying to sweat out the more expensive production methods,(tar sands, bitumen, shale) as part of a long term play to get the price of a barrel of oil to where they want it ~80-100/bbl. I don&#x27;t think they anticipated that US and other producers would just make up for the lost revenue by producing more(again, something that goes back to the beginnings of the oil business). The government is at risk of making themselves insolvent in the next 5 years or so if they continue this policy[1] and Im not really sure why they(or any producer) are making such short sighted decisions. Its not going to get better until the reduce the supply side glut[2]. Most producers are reactionary to this type of volatility and cancel well completions which take many months to bring online. Once we have reduced the over supply look for another swing as consumption overtakes available of supply until new wells can be brought back up to speed. From the information I have being in the business, that will take about 2-3 years or more, which may cause some pretty catastrophic financial crashes as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and other producers run out of money, which is already happening.[3]<p>keeping oil in the 50-100 dollar range is probably best for the world economy, but keeping everyone honest enough to produce the amount needed to get oil prices there is the problem. IMO, the blip in SUV sales isn&#x27;t going to significantly impact the environment. Even SUVs are getting 20mpg hwy in real world driving now. This is easily 25-50% better than the last time oil was cheap 10-15 years ago. Government standards are still mandating better CAFE scores, and everyone will be producing electric cars in the next 5-10 years. Some of the supply glut could be blamed on the fact that most cars are more efficient now and are using less oil.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.rt.com/business/319465-saudi-bankrupt-projection-imf/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rt.com/business/319465-saudi-bankrupt-projection...</a>\n[2]<a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=W_EPC0_SAX_YCUOK_MBBL&f=W"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=W...</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/nigeria-is-running-out-of-gas-2015-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/nigeria-is-running-out-of-gas...</a>",1454430666

I would never argue that there is no state in functional programming, just that the state is more explicit, localized, and easier to reason about.<p>In fact, in pure FRP, there are two fundamental building blocks: Behavior and Event. A Behavior is simply a value over time, and an Event is a value at an instant in time. Therefore, Behaviors are where you store state. However, what makes them &quot;easier to reason about&quot; is that oftentimes the API forces you to construct them in a way that makes all of the possible ways to change the Behavior are clear and present at once.<p>In summary, all inherently stateful concepts require stateful code, at lease somewhere under the hood.

In their mid-twenties they cannot afford to have a home, they are unable to secure the costs of first few years of raising child, when they don&#x27;t know if they will have a job in three months and they have zero savings. Add student loans to the mix, popular desires to travel the world, to &quot;live&quot; and it&#x27;s obvious why the developed countries have problems with natality.<p>One of the reason of population boom in Czechoslovakia in 1970&#x27;s was the policy of support of young families. Newly wed pairs were were provided security, they got their own homes, they had job security[1], they got financial support for raising children. It wasn&#x27;t a luxury, you couldn&#x27;t lead a lavish life, but you knew that if you have a child, everything will be OK.<p>[1] we are abstracting from the fact, that in socialist countries it was unlawful to be jobless.

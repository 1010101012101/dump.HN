5091979,comment,5091700,5091700,1,0,artursapek,,,"Meh, I really don't like the ""Virtuous Cycle of Web Applications"" [1]. It claims that retaining users amounts to doping them up every now and then with a ""new functionality"" to excite them and get them to use it again. Basically, feature spam.<p>This is a novelty approach, and it has no longevity. It doesn't last, and those aren't the users you want anyway. The webapps I use the most are the ones that actually offer something valuable to me. This sort of value is timeless. Google Docs is the first thing that comes to mind. I open Docs all the time on my own accord. Google don't whore themselves out with shiny new features because they don't have to. They wrote good software. It's a useful product.<p>I could see this strategy being more valid with web games, but as long as your webapp is a utility there's no dopamine burst you need provide users. Just help them get something accomplished and they'll be back.<p>[1] <a href=""http://media.tumblr.com/600e20abfacc231409d9a715fd985b86/tumblr_inline_mgu8pmshc11rw2osw.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.tumblr.com/600e20abfacc231409d9a715fd985b86/tum...</a>",1358783852

That was when pharma moved at the speed of software; that is what a landscape free for innovation can produce.<p>Well, we'd get new treatments a decade faster, but a lot of these treatments would not work and/or would kill people. But, as I said above, I don't think this would dramatically increase the speed of innovation, except for diseases where we don't have effective animal models. It's faster to run experiments on animals than people. For these diseases, removing regulations let people try treatments that worked on animals in humans faster. But the problem is really that there are many diseases we can't treat effectively in any organism, and letting people try any treatment they want in humans isn't going to fix this.<p>I think you are vastly overestimating what society has to gain by deregulating medicine.

Fraud is very easily the thing that can sink many small companies that aren't used to the levels of fraud that you will see on the Internet.  And because there are so many ways to defraud a merchant that isn't obvious, merchants need to be extremely careful and educated on the process.  And handling chargebacks will become a full-time job for someone in your company, once your company becomes big enough.  I work at a payments company, and fraud is something that ends up being a headache, although we are at lower-than average industry norms.<p>It seems relatively easy for someone to turn credit card payments directly into cash, by making a trade and then extracting cash through the bank account.  And the gap between your withdrawal policies and the chargeback policies of credit cards are pretty wide.  I would be very careful about this.  Forcing users to enter bank accounts make it a bit harder for average people to defraud, but not a motivated fraudster.  Also, allowing people to take delivery of wine through the purchase of a credit card, and then being subject to a chargeback will be extremely painful, although I'm not sure how easily chargebacks are fought in Europe.  If you do suffer a lot of chargebacks though, even if you successfully fight them all, be prepared to be dropped by your credit card processor.<p>I think your business is actually very interesting, but I'm surprised that credit card companies would allow you to accept credit cards at all, since I would think they would lazily lump you in as a form of brokerage site.  Not that I believe this, but it seems like an easy translation to stock brokerages, which don't accept credit card payments, but force you to transfer real cash into your accounts before you trade.  Then once you have money in a brokerage, they can extend margin, but they maintain their own risk by monitoring the margin levels, etc.<p>Good luck though, I read through your site and I think it's a very neat idea!",1358781480

So the bank was liable for the money lost in those situations - and as a result that put a blanket ban on all fine wine companies. We were able to talk Barclays around on this.<p>2. Storage of wine would be handled by a third party warehouse. If they screwed anything up (e.g. broke the case, had a fire, and insurance refused to pay out), there was a chance that buyers could get the money back through their bank if they paid by credit card.<p>and for us when we did accept this:<p>3. Getting the fees to work with our model - we wanted to offer a fixed fee for trading cases, but all banks / payment services wanted to take a percentage, including for debit card payments (hence my point about doing more work to get the model to work payment charges).<p>Obviously fraud is a major concern, and is something that we do a lot of work on as we scale up (e.g. at the moment we're manually processing all orders, taking ID for anyone buying more than 10k total etc).

I disagree with him because of specific hypocrisy and finger pointing. I am further disappointed that this story is so popular on Hacker News, because I read Hacker News for insightful posts, and this is just demagoguery - popular because it's what people want to hear.

From what I remember, Jeremy said that car has overheated and has reduced power (then they showed car stopping at the side of the track with the sound, which sounded very much like sound-over effect instead of make-believe real sound). At the time I thought that stopping because of overheating is normal and can happen to any car on the race track.<p>The ""does not work"" came later, near the end of the segment, and it was clearly stated, that the car does not work in the real life (because of the charging times), not that it doesn't work literally.",1301994400

The point is that, on a tablet, your parents wouldn't have had to go through the hassle of installing slow antivirus software or ""manage to install"" things. Installation and uninstallation is so  simple that the PC method of multistep installers and uninstallers immediately looks incredibly archaic.<p>There are other tasks like managing photos, watching and  editing movies, installing third-party software, and more that I bet your parents have trouble with or flat-out avoid on a PC. These things are easy on an iPad. Not to mention the constant threat of malware, no matter how paranoid your mom is.<p>If there's a totem that geeks cling to, it's the fear of the PC going away and the fantasy that PCs aren't overly complicated to an embarrassing degree, or that everyone can magically learn how to use PCs if they'd just spend hours every night on them like geeks do. It's symptomatic of a real lack of perspective when it comes to how the public deals with the standard PC. You and I think they're easy because we spend most of our time on them.

8827149,comment,8825456,8825456,0,0,jarpineh,,,"I find the premise of the article odd. Characterization of Hobbit in the movies as something that was made &quot;trying to honor every one of J. R. R. Tolkien’s footnotes, appendices, and letters&quot; and fit into LOTR film trilogy. Since Jackson did not have a licence to anything other than Hobbit, LOTR books and its footnotes, that&#x27;s what they used. Where they went with it made it impossible for me to watch more than the first film...<p>I don&#x27;t get what are the values of this &quot;morally bankrupt&quot; middle class according to Moorcock, if Tolkien&#x27;s work is confirmation of those. Destruction of nature for profit, corruption of power, strong being capable of using evil either blindly or wantonly. That is shown as bad, whereas simple, polite and modest (albeit with great amounts of food, ale and tobacco) life is good. I&#x27;d want a any &quot;class&quot; to adhere to those.<p>As for being Anti-Tolkien, I&#x27;d have to see some one produce as much content, build a world so intricate and even write a fable of it. Works of Tolkien have so many aspects beyond the stories of Hobbit and LOTR, that saying something is anti- to that feels too simplistic. I have read only a few of Eldrich books, but what I remember from those was not so encompassing or ambitious.<p>If you choose this one aspect from Tolkien&#x27;s works and decide to attack that, you certainly can, but what you actually accomplish? I&#x27;d rather read good fantasy from any writer, be it simple or complex. I&#x27;m currently re-reading Garth Nix&#x27;s Abhorsen trilogy, which might be classified as a children book, but it&#x27;s still very enjoyable and intelligent for an adult me.",1420214272

My champion at the company thinks they would balk if I told them $250/hr. - even though I would be saving them that much in the first year.<p>2. Since I intend to have the product finished by the time I negotiate, I could give them a fixed price with very low risk to me – say $25K-35K.<p>3. I could demo a working version when I talk to them. Having something that demonstrably works from Day One should be worth a premium over “I think I can get this done in time.” right? The risk is that part of my Secret Sauce would be revealed by the demo.<p>4. What is a good way to point out how much I’d be saving them? I imagine I can use that to set/justify my price somehow but I’m a little fuzzy on the approach.<p>5. Licensing the software to them (including source) on a yearly basis – say $15k a year. I would have to trust them as this is embedded software and they would have the source. This is the Big Question. I&#x27;ve never done something like this before. I probably won’t be licensing this to anyone else. Can I charge more for an “exclusive” license?<p>6.

I haven’t spoken directly to the company yet but I have an internal champion at the company who is pitching me to come in  to save a critical project that is going to miss its deadline. I&#x27;ve already started writing the software in anticipation and intend to have it finished before I talk to them.<p>The company currently has a non-software engineer working on this project and it is apparent that he will not be able to meet their deadline. Because of the inexperience of their in-house engineer, they will need to use faster more expensive hardware than they might otherwise. Frankly, I don’t think their current approach will work – they just don’t realize what they don’t know. Their deadline is in a couple of months.<p><i>Value proposition: On top of delivering something that actually works, I could save them ~$24K a year, year after year, because my more efficient code will allow them to use a base version of the hardware they are spec’ing instead of the more expensive one.</i><p>Normally, I charge $150/hr.

Sometimes they are deliberate policy decisions, and in this case newer features are at far greater risk of backward-incompatible changes, as with the CSS syntax and multimedia controls examples I mentioned in another post to this thread.<p>The thing is, if your site/app used to work and it doesn&#x27;t work any more after your customer updated their browser, and now you&#x27;re getting paged in the early hours to be second/third tier support, it is highly unlikely that you care about niceties like whether the browser developers consider the change to be desirable. So if nothing else, every time every browser pushes out a major update, a lot of people building sites or apps need to be testing that their own projects still work, which is clearly a much greater overhead if you do it eight or nine times per browser per year than if you only have to do it once or twice.",1420212923

8827041,comment,8826631,8826825,0,0,sparkie,,,"It&#x27;s worth questioning why &quot;proper use&quot; of the file system is never done in practice. The filesystem is the wrong abstraction for this kind of problem, purely because it only offers one-to-many relationships, bar hacks like symbolic links which are rarely used where they&#x27;d be suitable, and because it&#x27;s just simpler to dump metadata into a &quot;container&quot; with the media, and call it a file.<p>Nearly all real-world data has many-to-many relationships - for example, in music, we have several artists for the same song, and of course, artists perform multiple songs. The container formats we use for music are really shoddy and try to force these organic relationships into a limited set of tags, and then our filesystem doesn&#x27;t even have knowledge of this information unless we add plugins for specific file formats - another messy area.<p>MusicBrainz and similar services organize music &quot;the right way&quot; in a RDBMS, and also includes support for things like multi-language tagging, which is sorely lacking in our filesystems. Instead of trying to come up with &quot;one name to rule them all&quot; for a piece of media, each object is just given an identity, a uuid, then all the metadata is related to the uuid.<p>If we wanted to keep metadata and media separate, the obvious solution here is to dump the media in blobs in the same database - give each piece of media a uuid, and create a new relationship table to link the uuid to its metadata. I&#x27;d personally like this solution for my music. To do the same for files, we&#x27;d have an explosion of symbolic links to map the relationships, and no tool to really navigate through them effectively because we&#x27;re missing a query language. If we sat these indexes on the filesystem, we&#x27;d have a big loss of performance because of the extra layers of indirection and searching, for which no optimization is done.<p>A filesystem is really just a limited kind of database, but where we have a more powerful tool available, why not use it? Well, one reason is backward compatibility - our programs are written to look for files on filesystems, rather than streams from abstract sources. Perhaps what would be ideal in this kind of situation would be a FUSE layer which can expose the MusicBrainz database as a filesystem, but the underlying storage be the postgres db.",1420212861

With the levels of computing power we have nowdays, I think we should embrace centralization some more.<p>Another thing - that I do need to check up with history books, but I feel that the current notion of &quot;privacy&quot; is an artificial construct, an artefact of growing urbanization.

8826992,comment,8825456,8825456,0,0,bollockitis,,,"It makes me wonder if Moorcock has ever actually read Tolkien. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, some of the shine of Lord of the Rings has worn off, no doubt precipitated by the movies which relegated Tolkien&#x27;s rich world and epic themes to consumerist junk pocked with spring-action Legolas toys and Hollywood-inspired video games. So, yes, Tolkien&#x27;s world was sometimes very two-dimensional and naive. His characters and dialogue were sometimes laughably simplistic, but I prefer to think of LOTR as a vehicle for exploring larger themes of power and evil.<p>LOTR was written against the backdrop of Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, and a world where good and evil didn&#x27;t seem very ambiguous, yet think about how many times this ambiguity comes up: Gollum. Good or evil? Saruman? Boromir? There is nothing childish or &quot;Pooh-like&quot; about these characters. They are very real, very intense confrontations with good and evil. Even Bilbo and Frodo themselves struggle with this. We assume the ring has the power to corrupt, but is the ring truly doing the corrupting, or is this lust for power something innate within that the ring simply exploits for its own purposes?<p>And what defines true power? Is it the ring itself? Is it the one who carries it? Frodo and Sam, two of the smallest of the races of Middle-Earth manage to bring down the most powerful of enemies with little more than courage and a desire to do what&#x27;s right, while the powerful (the humans of Rohan and Gondor) quibble amongst themselves and their leaders are easily manipulated or go mad with sorrow and fear.<p>Long story short, I think Moorcock is wrong. I find the idea of a drug-addicted elf more ridiculous than anything Tolkien ever wrote. It&#x27;s as though Moorcock defines fantasy as merely a setting through which he can play out his literary amibitions. That isn&#x27;t to say there&#x27;s anything wrong with a drug-addicted elf, it&#x27;s just that drug addiction -- a so-called &quot;real&quot; problem to Tolkien&#x27;s alleged &quot;Pooh&quot; problems -- does not alone elevate one&#x27;s work to higher stature, nor should it be used a bludgeon to demote the work of others. I have learned far more about life and human nature from Tolkien than I have from Moorcock, and Tolkien&#x27;s work was more entertaining too.<p>EDIT: Oh, and if you want to read some incredibly clever and unique sci-fi/fantasy, check out anything by Gene Wolfe or Jack Vance. Wolfe&#x27;s Book of the New Sun is brilliant, and Vance&#x27;s Lyonesse trilogy is amazing.",1420212021

Be it fixed rail, stadium construction for a private team, or putting on an Olymipic event, the leader needs to fulfill their desire to do something.<p>Once the project, let us use the Olympics, are whispered as a possibility, an exploratory probe is performed; probes can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1,000,000 as they include analyses of existing facilities and requirements. Elected officials are excited because there is a remote possibility that the Olymipics could be hosted and sign off on the small funds. Bidding takes a couple of million to draw up plans for the facility deficiencies and shuttle the IOC team around the city; the leader gets to hob nob with the IOC team, press photos, other elected officials get to bask in the glow from local newspaper reports. After the national selection, your city needs to be selected to represent the nation, you move on to global selection committee. Repeat the process and you are looking at $16 million dollars for a successful bid, Salt Lake City was the last American Olympic bid I could find.<p>If you cannot finance this undertaking you need to find investors willing to finance the program; criminal rings are perfect as they can provide liquid assets and assist with the process by leaning on their contacts.<p>The risk management for the criminal entities:<p>* Failure to achieve Olympics, still have a leader to approach when the organization needs assistance with an issue, good result<p>* Success to achieve Olympics, the leader has favored companies to go to for projects during the bid construction process, further cementing the organizations grip, great result.<p>The United States has the funds at the federal level to contribute to the Olympic proposals after selection is won.<p>Reference: I was a periphery in the bidding process.",1420211784

Any time the military tries to design a super-advanced swiss-army knife it invariably fails.  This is the worst example of that in history.<p>> These are the normal teething problems every new advanced fighter goes through. The F-22 went through them. The F-16 and F-15 went through them, though it was so long ago nobody remembers. Nearly every project reaches a point where people say &quot;This will never work. Let&#x27;s cancel it.&quot;<p>Sure but the problems with the F-35 are waaayyy beyond teething issues.  The software is way behind schedule.  The fuselage has very poor rear visibility, so a targeting helmet was supposed to be developed but that&#x27;s way behind schedule and may never work.  The plane was designed without proper onboard lightning strike protection so it currently can&#x27;t fly in bad weather.  The plane can&#x27;t be loaded with fuel higher than 80 degrees in temperature so it can&#x27;t currently operate in a hot environment until retrofits to cooling trucks.  The jet wash from the USMC variant melts the decks of the amphibious carriers it is meant to operate from.  It has a poor turning and acceleration performance compared to Gen 4 fighter aircraft.  It has poor loiter time.  It doesn&#x27;t have the basic video uplink functionality for close air support that even the A-10 has.  It is already so far over budget that the unit price may approach that of the F-22.  Some of the partner nations that were supposed to buy it are backing out, thereby increasing the unit price.<p>The main problem with the F-35 is that the military took a lot of short cuts in drafting the requirements for this program, and when the predictable problems and schedule slippage occurred, they doubled down by relaxing testing requirements.<p>This is supposed to be the backbone of American air power for DECADES.  It would be one thing if this system would eventually perform as billed but it looks unlikely that it will and it will cost twice as much to purchase and operate as originally projected.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to cripple our air power for the next generation becaus of the sunk cost fallacy.<p>> By the way, the &quot;flexible plane idea&quot; has been incredibly successful in the F-18.<p>Yes, but the F-18 is a much, much simpler concept.  Carrier-based strike aircraft.  Then look at the F-35: stealthy land-based, carrier-based, and stovl aircraft that will perform strike, cas, and interceptor roles.  Right off the top the stovl requirement makes it very difficult to design a stealthy aircraft that will also have good enough aerodynamic performance to win a an air-to-air engagement after ther merge.<p>If the F-35 was only a carrier-based strike fighter that added stealthiness, maybe we&#x27;d have a winner.  But it is literally trying to be all things to three different services (one with a VERY difficult implement STOVL requirement) then throwing a difficult to implement low-observable requirement of which no other nation in the world has successfully implemented even a first generation of.",1420211728

Comes down to how much control content creators are willing to give-up, and what partnerships Dropbox forges with software developers.  For example, will Adobe want a user&#x27;s entire photo library synced with Dropbox?  What&#x27;s in it for them?

There&#x27;s a much more interesting discussion around the 90% of the people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> take the falsehoods out of their story, and whether it&#x27;s ultimately good or bad for society that they do so. (I can take either side on the &quot;Are CV lies good for the world?&quot; debate.) This fell short of what I was hoping for.<p>Ok, I&#x27;m going to go back to leading my team of Level 27 ninja-pirates and saving the world with a 468-node Spark cluster now.",1420211076

On Star Trek no one seems to care that the Federation always knows where they are because they trust that their rights are respected uniformly.

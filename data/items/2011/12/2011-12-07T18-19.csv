Countries must borrow money from the banks and banks (like Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, etc) lend money to countries at highly speculative rates.

3325264,comment,3324890,3324890,8,0,noelsequeira,,,"There's a superbly written piece by Xianhang Zhang on Quora, that talks about the same concept. It's titled ""Disregard Ideas, Acquire Assets"" and presents a really convincing case by citing examples of entrepreneurs that focused on building assets, until as he puts it ""they couldn't not do a startup with them"". (Leverage could qualify as one of the more important ones, or if you want to look at it another way, acquiring substantial assets equates to earning leverage).<p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/Xianhang-Zhang/Disregard-ideas-acquire-assets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Xianhang-Zhang/Disregard-ideas-acquire-...</a><p>This notion runs contrary to the standard approach that most early stage entrepreneurs adopt, namely the ""build a laundry list of ideas and filter the top ones out using a combination of a heuristic, common sense and (eventually) customer validation and keep at it until you have traction with a concept that matters"" approach.<p>I'm going to stick my neck out here, and recommend the approach that Zhang proposes - ""focus relentlessly on acquiring interesting assets and then execute on the startups that naturally fall out of them"". This means you might be pursuing something for the longest time that doesn't remotely resemble a startup. I'd qualify this with one caveat - make sure whatever it is, it's something you love doing.<p>And I think this is an interesting way to go about becoming an entrepreneur. Maybe you shouldn't dive in the deep end straight away (if you haven't built sufficient leverage / assets). Maybe that's another way deferring gratification, what with how cool just 'being an entrepreneur' has recently become.",1323284289

If that was true, I've learned a new fact that conflicts with most of what I know about obesity having an effect on, for example, heart disease.<p>The first link when googling for ""lifespan by bmi"" is:<p><a href=""http://wehrintheworld.blogspot.com/2009/05/bmi-and-life-expectancy-results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wehrintheworld.blogspot.com/2009/05/bmi-and-life-expe...</a><p>Which cites two metareviews. The first is a collaboration between the UK Medical Research Council, several British organizations including one out of Oxford, and the US National Institute on Aging (which is under the NIH umbrella). It was published in _The Lancet_ (Impact factor: 33). I will quote the quoted part from said blogpost:<p>> BMI is in itself a strong predictor of overall mortality both above and below the apparent optimum of about 22·5–25 kg/m2. The progressive excess mortality above this range is due mainly to vascular disease and is probably largely causal. At 30–35 kg/m2, median survival is reduced by 2–4 years; at 40–45 kg/m2, it is reduced by 8–10 years (which is comparable with the effects of smoking). The definite excess mortality below 22·5 kg/m2 is due mainly to smoking-related diseases, and is not fully explained.<p>While I found a few studies that didn't find a correlation (including one in AMA), I can't actually find an academic source for the claim that people with a BMI of 25-30 have the longest lifespan and see <i>lots</i> of claims that the optimal BMI is in the low 20s.

I panicked when I realized I didn't want to work in finance after undergrad and felt pressure to please my family.  I was envious of my friends that seemed to have it all figured out, depressed and piling up student debt.  I thought there was no way out.  Then I had an epiphany- what's the point of being pressured to do something that you don't want to do?  Why chase potential status or money when this is a sure-fire way of waking up at 35 and being miserable with what you do?  Most of us are smart enough to be able to succeed as long as what we're doing makes us happy.  I decided to figure out what makes me happy- what do I enjoy doing in my spare time, what interests me?  For me, it was a mix of business and technology.  I found a conversion tech degree program, dropped out of law school (finally manned up and confronted my parents that I was responsible for my life), completed a MS program in about than 1.5 years (I did it in the UK) and never looked back.  Flash forward 3 years from my dark days in law school- I'm in a rewarding job that I love, I'm happily married (I met my wife through a friend that I met in the MS program) and loving life.<p>Takeaways for you:\n1. if you're not happy with what you're doing, stop, I know it is scary, but believe me, the rewards are worth it.  You don't have to completely drop out of your program, you can take a year off (most schools offer that option) and spend that year figuring out what makes you happy and pursuing that goal!<p>2.  don't be pressured into unhappiness- if it is your parents, confront them.  Yes, it is difficult, the convo I had with my parents was one of the most difficult things I have ever done up to that point- but you have to live for yourself, not for anyone else.  Confront the pressure.<p>3. My education (mis)adventures left me with about $100-105K of student debt.  That is a scary number, but is manageable.  Make sure your debt has a fixed interest rate, you can apply for income based repayment plan which will give you plenty of breathing room.",1323283648

Seems a pretty simple problem, yet few companies I talk to want to go down that route.</i><p>No, contractors are usually not a great fit for a few reasons.<p>1. They're expensive. A lot of can cost a 50% to 100% premium on a salaried employee.  Example most good contractors I know (solid, quality devs not rockstar architects) go for about $125 an hour in the SF Bay Area. Over 48 (assume some timeoff) weeks this is about $240,000 a year.  This gets worse working startup hours where you get a cost efficiency with salaried employees when people work massive amounts of overtime.   Imagine the quality of engineer you can get for $200k a year.<p>2. When contractors are done all the knowledge of what they've done goes out of house.  Both in terms of what you lose as well as any proprietary info that can now go into competitors hands.<p>3. Contractors don't have to work your hours.  A lot of people aren't aware of the legal differences between a contractor and a full time employee because its very vague. But you can't just say ""boom"" you're a contractor and expect them to show up every day like a regular employee.  Some do and if they don't complain its fine, but if you piss one off they can easily get you in trouble with the IRS and your state's labor code. If you expect an employee to show up every day, at your office and work 9 to 5, and work off your product backlog then they are by law a ""full time"" employee. You're expected to take out payroll taxes, workmans comp etc.<p>No hire a few very competent people who can adjust.  Where contractors have their place is on discrete pieces of work - doing your iPhone app,  performance tuning your stack etc. These are great places to have contractors come in.",1323283375

They're happy to sacrifice greater market potential to do so- like not allowing carrier customisations, making multiple models, etc. They've compromised this somewhat for the iPhone (they clearly didn't want to have carrier-subsidised handsets originally, for example) but it has worked out for them in a huge way. Still- historically, the ubiquity of the iPhone is in some ways atypical for Apple.<p>Nokia, on the other hand, has always been more than happy to play ball with the carriers. They should be where Android is now- the ecosystem with a ton of different phone models, carrier-bundled apps, cheap phones and a huge market share.

I really don't see Page/Brin/Rubin in a room in 2006, rubbing their hands together thinking they were going to shock the world. It seems more like the Google guys were big Sidekick fans and saw the chance to work with Rubin for relatively cheap. But they kept their options open, made a lot of cautious small bets rather than going all in. They didn't make the iPhone, no, but they placed themselves in a position where they could react to iPhone. By being open to the opportunity and a lot of luck, they essentially became the only choice a monster sized industry had in the face of huge disrupting new competitor.<p>Google often get slagged for the unfocused, perpetual beta thing. But laser focus is overrated. For example, given the choice of only picking Chrome OS or Android, a laser focused Google would have never gone Android.

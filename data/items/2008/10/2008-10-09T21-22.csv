328311,comment,328047,328196,0,0,LPTS,,,"It seems to be a good thing.  We can't be certain it's a good thing.  :)<p>A very good thing you can do to regain open-mindedness, mental flexibility, and willingness to contemplate alternative ideas to remove all forms of ""to be"" from your speech, thinking, and writing.  Most of the certainty comes from the way ordinary language is tainted by forms of the verb ""to be.""  General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, General Semantics, Godel's Incompleteness, basically everything we know about science in the last 60 years tells us everything seems relative to the tools you use to make the measurements about the things you are claiming.  Because we all use our nervous system to make any claims, when we say ""is"" instead of some variant of ""seems to me (or my nervous system, or my instruments)"" we improperly discharge the instrument with which we made the measurement from our claims.<p>Another very good habit to get into is adding ""maybe"" to your thinking and speech a lot more.  If you feel certain about something, you should think of alternatives until you no longer feel certain of it.  You can feel relatively certain, but there is no experience such that there is only one correct interpretation of it.<p>When it comes down to it, you make decisions based on the relative strength of the various maybes.  It seems to me the sky is blue, but maybe it's red and I forgot to eat food with vitamins my eyes need, maybe aliens put a giant sky tarp over the part of the sky I am seeing, so I'm not seeing the sky, or maybe it's cloudy and I'm just so excited for it to be nice out I misperceive the grey.  Even though I can think of alternative possibilities, I can still act on the strong maybe that the sky seems blue to me.<p>I have found ""Quantum Psychology"" by Robert Anton Wilson contains many valuable insights into changing your pattern of thinking to remove the certainty antiquated notions of science and use of the verb ""to be"" incorrectly force into the thinking of people who are overly certain.  I recommend it highly to any entrepreneur, especially anyone who considers themselves a paradigm buster.",1223589063
328310,comment,327279,328003,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'd be willing to try an IKEA chair.  When we start hiring full-time people, I'll give my Aeron to the first hire, and sit in a Markus myself to see if it's up to snuff--if it is, that's wonderful.  I'd love to save $600 per chair over used Aerons.<p>But, frankly, I'm suspicious.  IKEA furniture is not exactly known for quality or longevity (though its quality is often equal to furniture costing several times more...a lot of furniture, even expensive furniture, is just made really horribly these days--I was astounded to note that relatively expensive places like Ethan Allen and Restoration Hardware are now selling MDF garbage just like Walmart and Target...people are often dumb enough to buy based on brand without any knowledge of what they're buying).<p>How long have you been sitting in this chair?  I've got six or seven years of ass time in my Aeron, and it sits exactly the same as when I bought it (the foam lumbar support dingus did just give up the ghost a few weeks ago, so it's slightly the worse for wear--but, just like parts in a high quality electronic device, it's a replaceable component, and I always wanted the upgraded adjustable Y-shaped lumbar thing, anyway, so it's a mixed blessing...and, many people remove that part and sit in the chair with no additional lumbar support, anyway, so the chair is still perfectly functional and comfortable).",1223588888

For me, market research usually identifies opportunities I have missed and obstacles I should take into account. And it helps adjust expectations. A lot of people you'd think would say yes end up saying no.<p>I think many people miss the fact that a lot of this ""business stuff"" was done in the past because it normally took a lot more capital to start a business before the internet. You really had to think through your ideas before you put thousands of dollars on the line. Now all you need to take care of is a domain name and $100/month in hosting fees. It just doesn't pay to spend so much time when the risk is so low.<p>So ask yourself, would a prototype cost you anything?

You don’t need a gym membership — but it’s easier to use weights than gravity, especially with core muscles.<p>I made a comment about lifting weights being a ""cop out."" A cop out, only in the sense that it is not a complete work out. I probably could have phrased this better.<p>I bench 300 lbs (max), squat 400, and deadlift 500 -- lifting weight has been a key part of my strength training program -- problem is, strength training is more than just lifting weights.<p>For example, instead of doing squats/leg press , or lunges, try running the steepest hill you can find 10x at full-sprint --30-60 seconds.<p>2. 90 min/ day<p>This comment was meant to suggest block 90 minutes out of your schedule to work out. Not work out for 90 minutes. If you drive/ride/walk/run to the gym, that takes time. If you stretch, that takes time. If you need to make a protein shake after you workout, that takes time.<p>3. Get in Shape<p>The overarching idea hear is simple: physical fitness, however you define it, is important. I wrote this post to share my own challenges in getting back in shape, and to encourage those who aren't currently in shape to try it out.<p>Really, regardless of whether you want to lift, run, bike, swim, et. al, the idea is to pick something and do it-- make a decision to get in shape, and go do that activity.<p>The decision is more important than the specifics, at least in the beginning.",1223587331

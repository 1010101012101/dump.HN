If so, I think that's a valid point (though I happen to disagree in this case).</i><p>I am in favour of semantic sugar, I just don't think it should be part of the language. Languages should be small, and have features that enable syntactic sugar to be written in the language. These features might include macros (like in Lisp, or at a pinch C) or overloaded operators (as in C++ or Python).<p>Regarding decorators, I don't see that they bring much value. The decorator syntax is no shorter than doing it without decorators, so if you remove the decorator syntax you're making Python a smaller language which makes it easier to learn and understand.",1287824255

1823023,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,waterhouse,,,"At several summer camps, we wore lanyards that carried our dining hall cards.  Occasionally, I forgot mine.  But I gained admittance to the dining hall anyway...<p>The structure of the dining hall was this: There were several tables outside the building, and more tables directly inside, and then there was the entrance to the kitchen/buffet area with the food.  On the right side of the entrance, there was a cashier who swiped people's cards as they came in.  People would go in, get a tray of food, and come out to eat; later, they might bring their tray back in for more food.  Those who went back in just passed by the cashier to the left; you didn't have to pay twice to get seconds.<p>So, here's what I did: Send in a friend, who picks up two trays at once (still stacked; it looks almost the same as a single tray) with an extra plate (again, stacked under another) and comes out.  Out at the table, I take his extra tray, put an extra plate on it, maybe scrub a bit of food on it, put on his lanyard, and carry the tray ""back"" in to get ""seconds"".

1823022,comment,1818954,1819303,0,0,Niten,,,"PHP will bite you, common sense or not.  The language has serious misfeatures – platform-dependent integer sizes, or cgi.fix_pathinfo=1 by default allowing the interpreter to execute files without a .php extension, just off the top of my head – that require knowledge and action well above and beyond ""common sense"" to work around.<p>And all of these faults in the language, even the minor ones, just contribute to the unnecessary cognitive load of using the language.  So the way I see it, if I'm starting a new project then why not just pick a sane language like Perl or Ruby or Python instead and save myself all the headaches?  It's not 2004 any more, we're no longer constrained to languages that have good Apache modules, and with that constraint gone there are very few reasons to pick PHP over the competition.",1287824125

You can't help but learn many useful hacks along the way.<p>Here's one: How to deal with the police.  Their work is boring and it's not unusual for them to go long stretches of time without being paid.  They see you coming up the road-- They're curious and you look interesting.  They motion for you to pull over and unless you've managed to get so close that you can plausibly claim you didn't see the baton waving you'd better obey them.<p>The hack: For goodness sake don't sit their dumbly and wait for them to speak up!  If you do they'll have to justify pulling you over.  ""Document!"", and you're screwed.  The next thirty minutes are spent going through your papers and your belongings while they look for any pretense to hit you up for a fine/bribe.  Yes, it's corrupt, but understand that is the only way of life for them.  Empathy and understanding will get you much further than casting judgment.<p>Be the first to speak.  Raise your helmet visor, smile and ask for help of some kind.  Even something as simple as, ""Skolka kilometer Volgograd?"" will do.  When they answer, nod, smile, shake their hand and say, ""Speciba.""<p>There's a 75% chance you're done and you can go on your way.

Now your acceptance or rejection of this definition is not important.  What is important is that Ocaml and Haskell both strongly encourage the use of OO <i>as you defined it</i>, that they greatly facilitate it, and that they even make it the standard way of writing programs.  I insist because that's definitely <i>not</i> what one would say at first, especially starting from the reasonable looking definition of OO you provided.<p>I don't need strict boundaries between languages, I see them.  Some languages have automatic currying, some do not. Some have duck typing, some have type inference… and so on.  A single difference in two languages' core features can make them quite different.  Of course, if you measure languages along a single given axis (like the OO/not OO axis), the boundaries appear much smoother.  By the way, I don't see how the fact that language designers are influenced by the languages they learned support (or refute) the assertion that the boundaries between languages aren't strict.<p>> <i>Languages evolve. Philosophies evolve. Terminology evolves. Expecting to find a rigid definition within so much change is naive. Your definition will be obsolete before you get it written down.</i><p>Beware.

Now, if you <i>do</i> think that the meaning of the term ""OO"" evolve so fast that it's not worth writing down, then you'll agree that the term ""OO"" itself shouldn't be used at all..<p>I didn't say that Ideas cause flame wars. I said that using some <i>terms</i>,which aren't the ideas themselves, can cause flame wars. (I said «""OO""», not «OO».)

1823002,comment,1822376,1822638,0,0,wyuenho,,,"Decorators and lambdas are completely different and separate topics, one <i>CAN</i> exist without the others.<p>A decorator is a function that takes a function, optionally some parameters and return a function. What this tells you is that a decorator is a special instance of a higher-order function, that takes a (partially applied) function, fudge around with its internals and return that same function, fully applied. When I said function, they can be named of course, which is the case for most of the Python functions.<p>Your second example would accomplish the same thing, but let's change it to something like this:<p><pre><code>  somefunc = dec(def (x, y):
      blabla)
</code></pre>
However, this proposal instead of introducing a new language syntactic feature, you would have to change how the interpreter parses and compiles function argument, namely it'll need to understand a def function definition without a name as an expression. The interpreter would also need to assign an internal name to the lambda and compile it to a function object.<p>That's not a trivial change in the grammar of the language. However, I'd agree that having that instead of a Python lambda would make a lot of HO functional style programming a lot more fluid.",1287822790

    def somefunc(x, y):
        blabla
    somefunc = dec(somefunc)
</code></pre>
The rationale for decorators, AIUI, is that if somefunc() is long, then putting the decorator at the end makes it easier to overlook, whereas putting it at the top is harder to overlook. Personally, I never use them; if I want the functionality of decorators, I write code immediately after the function, e.g.:<p><pre><code>   def add(a, b):
      r = a.getValue() + b.getValue()
      return sm.UInteger(r)
   notify(add, ""ii"", ""i"", ""+"", cascade=True)

Programming is thinking and creating...</i><p>This at first sounds true but really isn't; programming is not pure thought: it's thinking <i>and implementing</i> and seeing how the implementation goes and trying a different way, having new ideas, etc.<p>You can't ""think"" in a pure vacuum; you need to bounce ideas off something real.<p>I do some woodworking and let me assure you the ""ideas"" that I have before starting a project get changed a lot when confronted to the reality of wood and tools.<p>After a while you discover that, to some extent, you end up making your own tools, that fit you and the projects you like to do.<p>Programming-wise, that's also why I dislike IDEs: they add an additional layer between you and the object you're working on; it's like woodworking with gloves (impossible). And they don't contribute much; they advertise ""speed"", but the slow part is thinking, not typing!<p>- - -<p>(I'm typing this on a daskeyboard with blank keys, I've used it for two years, it's fantastic.)",1287821235

You can definitely write code in it that gets shit done.<p>It's that it exists in the same universe with Python, Ruby, Java, Clojure, Erlang, etc.<p>If you have the freedom to choose your implementation language, and those are your alternatives (to name just a few), that's when PHP is harder to justify. Not that it's terrible in isolation. In relative terms.",1287821172

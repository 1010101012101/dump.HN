289330,comment,289255,289255,0,0,iamdave,,,"I think it's a fantastic idea, proposing open standards for books but there's a major incumbent people aren't looking at: <i>academia still doesn't trust the Internet</i>.  Students are often limited to one Internet source and the rest hard copied sources.  We on HN know how well open licensing goes on the Internet because we use it everyday, academia uses the Internet for internal email and checking the weather, otherwise it's treading on their territory and they don't like that.<p>Amazon is pushing a student version of the Kindle out, but just like other tech toys you're starting to see in the classroom, at the most you'll see them used in community colleges and maybe even a few privileged high schools, but the major universities and academies are highly unlikely to jump on the ship and provide DRM free textbooks any time in the near future.",1219945693

Everything shoved into the dictionary named Smalltalk, including ""isA"" methods for every subsystem you've written shoved up to Object isn't a big deal for in-house development.  When you publish a library or grab one from somewhere, then it becomes a big problem.  Then you want namespaces.<p>So the real-world experience for Smalltalk is that the former is mostly FUD.  The latter is a real issue.  I suspect that this pretty much applies to the other dynamic languages as well.",1219945520

What, should I have broken it down into 12 steps?<p>To sum it up: let him solve problems his own way.  Let him develop tools/abstractions that help him hide the sort of details and menial tasks that sap his strength.  Force him to get up and go exercise or relax.  Don't hold a nebulous infinishable to-do list over his head to guilt trip him-- he will come down off of his creative high and beat himself up for being irresonsible and may even shut down emotionally.  Allow him to relate to people one at a time-- a hike with only <i>one</i> of the children, dates and activities without a big crowd.  Don't take it personally when he absolutely dreads doing activities you think are ""fun"".  Go stand by his desk until he gets that nagging little task done.  Tell him things like, ""if you don't get anything else done today, please look into x; it's really important to me.""  And no, he doesn't need all of a June Cleaver, a secretary, and a personal accountant-- he does need someone to play the part of a ""coach"", though.  And someone that can organize some of the pesky details into something he can act on can be critical to this guy getting anything done.",1219944696

The author paints a picture of the VC as an innocent victim of changing times:<p>""VC doesn’t have a greater share of bad actors than the ecommerce or gaming sectors. Large-scale, software VC is simply a formerly great business in decline, and there are a lot of good, smart people who haven’t made in VC yet who are worried about their (and their families’) economic futures. It’s not evil — it’s their job and they may not feel they can switch.""<p>Those poor VCs who have no other career options available to them, and must therefore resort to squeezing every last drop of blood from entrepreneurs who don't know any better.<p>I absolutely believe that there are some fantastic VCs out there, but anger against the industry is only natural when you've been screwed over like some of these companies have.",1219943482

Identifying authorship is important not only to give credit (or blame) where it&#x27;s due, but also for historical reasons, to know how research developed among particular threads in a given disciplines.<p>Naming authors is necessary to verify results, e.g., when authors admit to faking results (not a rarity), other articles by those authors are suspect as they should be.  Publishing anonymously makes it hard or even impossible to know the legitimacy of reports especially as time since publication gets longer.<p>While anonymous publication is highly unlikely to happen, IMO there are a few things that would materially improve the process.  I think <i>peer review</i> and perhaps editing itself <i>should be</i> done anonymously.  That way much of the &quot;politics&quot; is eliminated because anonymous review would have to accept/reject a manuscript <i>only on its merit</i>.  In line with principles of full disclosure, an accepted paper would be published under its authors&#x27; names.<p>It might also help to reduce political pressures associated with publishing.  One change to consider is encouraging reports of research findings or results, but discouraging premature &quot;conclusions&quot;, i.e., when effectively authors&#x27; speculations.  In many fields data is lacking or inadequate to support conclusions, it&#x27;s hard to say what data mean until there&#x27;s enough such that clear patterns emerge.  Constraining the urge to be the first to reach a conclusion could reduce unnecessary competitiveness in research communities.<p>Contributing to the community is important in science, but contribution has a value that needs to be recognized or rewarded if we are to see it continue.  Publishing a scientific report is an accomplishment to be proud of, certainly not selfish to enjoy being known for having done something worthy.",1450599969

If you would like to use the Hoover Dam - one of the largest dams in the world, holding back one of the largest man made reservoirs in the world as my counterexample, be my guest.<p>My point wasn&#x27;t that the dam will fail (although they do) - far from it: my point is that the dam, once put in, is really hard to take <i>out</i> and the dam itself holds back all the debris that usually flows out the river. That debris builds up, until - uh oh - you don&#x27;t have enough water in your reservoir anymore to generate power.<p>That, and plugging up an entire watershed is pretty much akin to destroying the ecosystem that depends on the water flowing free to the ocean. Entire species of fish die off; the natural environment of other plants and animals is hopelessly changed, etc.<p>Some parts of the US only have 5% of rivers flow without a dam. Hydroelectricity is not sustainable now, and is far from inexhaustible.<p>So, back to the Hoover Dam - who&#x27;s idea was it, to build a reservoir for water, in the middle of the desert? Did anyone think, &quot;wonder if the water will all evaporate?&quot; Because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening,<p><a href=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-lake-mead-low-20150429-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-lake-mead-low-20150429-s...</a><p><a href=""http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2666/how-long-are-dams-like-hoover-dam-engineered-to-last"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2666/how-long-are-d...</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Dam#Environmental_impact"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Dam#Environmental_impac...</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qou2KkLkYVg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qou2KkLkYVg</a><p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/25/opinion/too-many-dammed-rivers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/25/opinion/too-many-dammed-ri...</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dam+disaster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dam+disaster</a>",1450599553

Meanwhile Z80 was popularised by Sinclair with the ZX Spectrum (which built on the hugely popular ZX81).<p>Personally as a newbie to programming (as everyone was at the time, to varying degrees), I preferred the simplicity of the 6502 because it only had three registers. Meanwhile, the extra registers on the Z80 also came with programming concepts that were beyond me at the time. I always knew the Z80 was better!!!<p>Despite knowing the Z80 to be better it was the underdog at the time in the UK home computing sector, more accomplished but used in the cheaper Sinclair style machines with the 6502 in more expensive machines.<p>Why were the 6502 machines more expensive? The extra chips that went with the 6502 such as the 6522 IO chip and commonly found chips like the AY-3-8910 sound chip provided useful features that were handled very well by these support chips. They cost money. Meanwhile, in Z80 land with the likes of Clive Sinclair, some ULA chip of some sort would be put together. This chip would work with the CPU to do all of these extra functions badly.<p>On the ZX81 the CPU did everything. This included the screen. In &#x27;fast mode&#x27; you would have no screen. With sound on the spectrum, the same story. Rather than have some neat electronics do the sound properly the CPU would stop everything it was doing to make some &#x27;beep&#x27;.<p>So, in 2015, which to go for? If you are not going to be making millions of these boards there is no point saving money on the support logic. Therefore the Z80 - the better CPU - with a proper set of support chips is what to go for.",1450599453

A critical component to achieving HRT is interrupt response time. Z80 has two complete sets of hardware registers and a one byte instruction to toggle which is active. So with the basic 2.5MHz clock time from raising the interrupt to execution of the first instruction of the handler was 2 usecs. With zero additional context saving to do. Add to that hardware vectored interrupts and it was golden - you landed directly in the handler for the specific peripheral. No need to poll status registers.<p>Not only way ahead of its time, this kind of performance feature is still apparently unknown. Even in GHz SOC systems and modern DSPs.  I&#x27;ve seen some really arcane and baroque interrupt status trees in my time since. All take significant code to parse and dispatch. One really egregious offender was the i960 CPU, sold specifically into the data communications market by Intel in the mid 90&#x27;s. Sold into a necessarily HRT application domain. Even at a 50 MHz clock it still took 6 - 10 usecs to get started doing actual work.

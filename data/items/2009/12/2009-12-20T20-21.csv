When a single machine can generate queries and lookups and log and render results faster, you need fewer machines to handle a given load. I know we increased our web front end capacity by 5x when we migrated from PHP to Java that runs backend queries asynchronously, so we reallocated some boxes and now we won't need to light up new hardware for a while.

I don't think anyone would have looked at LAMP 5 years ago and say it's scalable, but Facebook did it, in steps, because they had very talented engineers. I found the point of ""don't use a relational database"" ironic considering they contrasted Friendster and Facebook. Facebook uses MySQL as their backing store. While they might not use it in the traditional way, they most certainly evolved from joins and normalization to their current scheme as a sharded object store as it became critical to their growth.",1261342329

Whereas the Arc version is built by combining highly orthogonal components that can be recombined to solve completely different problems. Do you really not see the difference?</i><p>This is why the appropriate test is the ability for an average programmer to put together a DSL for a randomly-selected problem domain: it actually speaks to the power of the language. The characteristics of orthogonality and combinatorial flexibility is what DSLs are made to do. Arc doesn't have a monopoly on them. The only thing that is interesting here is your choice to include web-specific functionality in Arc. I think it's a great choice, but it just doesn't say much about the general expressiveness of the language as a whole.<p>We may have reached the point here where splitting hairs over DSLs versus included libraries is not going to get anybody anywhere. From what I understand, I would certainly agree that Arc programmers having such easy access to stateless web programming in a highly flexible manner is a great thing for the language.<p>But I would judge any language by the ability to easily add solutions to other problem domains that are highly orthogonal and flexible, not necessarily by the problem domains that are enabled by default.<p>Hope that makes sense.

X-Factor viewers as a group are probably poorer, older and less educated* than Facebook users. The recent cold spell, the BBC speculates, meant fewer people who would have bought the X-factor single could get to a store to do so - even if a Facebooker wanted a physical CD, he or she would simply order it from Amazon and not care when it arrived, since the sale would be logged. At 79p for a single on iTunes, Facebook users could fix the UK charts <i>every week</i> without even noticing the expenditure in time or money. However what the X-factor has is people who really will loyally buy its single every year; the Facebook crowd has a very short attention span.<p>* I don't mean this in a disparaging way at all.",1261341832

You'd need many more developers working, and the average American emits 20 tons of CO2 per year. So if Facebook has 100 developers hacking PHP code, they'd probably need at least 200, or possibly 300 developers hacking C++ code. 100 developers is 2,000 tons of CO2 per year (at average rates). From an economic standpoint, it would make much more business sense to use carbon offsets. Not to mention that a 10x end-to-end efficiency improvement is AWFULLY optimistic.

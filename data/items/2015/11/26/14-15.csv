All of my questions were posed with genuine curiosity rather than with the passive-aggressive tone I may have unintentionally conveyed. I certainly am not in that group of language warriors. I don&#x27;t have any allegiances to languages, platforms, styles of languages, or even architectures (I&#x27;ll use a Harvard based over von Neumann if it gets the job done better).<p>Most of the people I know choosing C++ over C# are using it for the ability to get soft-real-time guarantees w/r/t performance. E.g. the gaming development guys have a &quot;this next framebuffer ~must~ be done within 16.6 or 33.3 ms&quot; or &quot;I need a deterministic &#x27;buy/sell/hold/not-enough-information-to-say-with-a-high-confidence-factor, defer-to-safety-net-policy&#x27;&quot;. At CppCon &#x27;15 most of the people I spoke to fell into a similar camp. I don&#x27;t think I even spoke with one engineer who&#x27;s day job involved using C++ because <insert CLR language here> failed to have interop capabilities w/ DX or what not. Of course, those who attend conferences will bias in a certain way so I&#x27;m not making an appeal to that demographic as in any way representative of the C++ user-body.<p>My assertion was simply : those who are using C++ are using it out of the benefits of predictable behavior. They can&#x27;t afford that situaiton of: your GC won&#x27;t decide this is the appropriate time to move all those marked as Gen0->1 over and oh by the way they&#x27;re all a few bits big and fragmented so no pre-fetching help for you.  What makes those guys different from the guys who were ASM guys who refused to use C back in the day is that the compiler eventually outperformed the hand-rolled stuff - but even then the ASM guys were steadfast. You make some real interesting points though and you&#x27;re right - I haven&#x27;t looked at the C#7 roadmap. Hell, to be honest I haven&#x27;t even written enough code to take advantage of Roslyn&#x27;s introspective capabilities. Thanks though, insightful comment as always.

For small markets it&#x27;ll never pay the labor and local-FCC-equivalent certification costs.  There would be tradeoffs and other problems; some countries are very locked down and unamused at the idea of someone telling their wifi they are in Japan despite being somewhere else thus enabling unusual power and freq limitations.  Small countries and markets would be discriminated against, likely never getting a pi legally shipped to them, an intentionally avoiding serving poor people is kind of counter to most of the politics and rhetoric of the group.<p>There is a compromise of putting a port on the thing where a locally puchased wifi dongle could be installed.  The port would have to provide power and be fast enough to be wifi usable.  It would be really nice if that port were popular.  The Pi People seem to like community building and a USA distributor could bundle a USA FCC certified wifi adapter with every board, just plug it in.  That port is called the USB port.

The properties of Pascal made it the closest thing to an ideal language for future-proof apps back then. I predicted that, if Borland failed, it would be straight-forward enough to create a replacement stack due to Pascal&#x27;s focus on simplicity. It was good to see each iteration of Free Pascal do exactly that.<p>Not sure if I&#x27;d recommend Pascal today given whats available. It&#x27;s still one of easiest to pick up and should be effectively future-proof. Way better than ending up with COBOL, C, etc codebases. Maybe those will be its legacy.

Between &quot;natural&quot; multipassenger vehicle occupation and the occasional underutilization they would indeed be very unlikely to ever cause a local net improvement. But if they occasionally do motivate actual pooling, that &quot;compression&quot; will carry on to roads without a pool lane because the passengers won&#x27;t pop out their magical inflatable cars from the trunk once the pool lane ends. Therefore, actual usefulness not only depends on the amount of lane-generated pooling and the level of local underutilization (which needs to be non-null to provide a pooling incentive), but also on the fraction of regular road vs pool-laned road distance traveled under &quot;lane motivated&quot; multipassenger occupation.<p>The net result might still be negative, but a purely local observation on pool lanes cannot be enough to come to a meaningful conclusion.",1448549117

While it should not matter (because your authentication and authorization mechanisms are good, right?), merely making it so a user can&#x27;t easily guess what endpoints correspond to another user is an additional protection.<p>For the database itself, the benefits are simply those that come from the fact that every ID, regardless of where it was generated, should be unique. This means you can, per the_mitsuhiko, generate keys in a distributed fashion, but it means more than that. Even rows from disparate databases have unique identifiers, which has benefits all the way down the line, as everyone has a way to refer to a particular entry that uniquely identifies it, regardless of where it came from. It lets you separate, and recombine the data, without worrying (depending on the type of UUID, at least) about collisions (separating being something like a NoSQL database, where based on the hashing key it gets written to one nodeset, allowing you to scale out; recombining being something like that, or you had multiple regions/databases in a SQL solution, but you need to run queries against both and merge the results for insertion into a single database for various metrics or similar).<p>Whether you need any of that is entirely dependent on your use cases; an incrementing ID in the database is perfectly valid for many needs.",1448546764

Sure there are times when you need a mock object for java mail or external services you need to mock out.  But, doing it for every service you have is really a lot of work for questionable gain.  This is predicated on practical experience rather than architecture theory.  The reason you separate your system for testing is to find more bugs.  I found that I wasn't finding anymore bugs by separating things than I was by testing it integrated.  And, in fact I found more bugs in the integration of services than I would if I only tested them in separate form.  Therefore, I stopped doing the extra work to separate them because the payoff was really too small to bother.  It's been much more productive to think like this.",1268065728

In Kerala for instance,  (one of the four states in South India), practically everyone is a non vegetarian.  Hyderabad(in Andhra Pradesh)  is famous for its nonvegetarian food, specially Biriyani. You have no idea about the amount of liquor consumed either. Extremely large quantities of liquor are consumed in South India. There is a thriving illegal liquor mafia which would be very interested in your discuvery that South India is ""not inclined"" to liquor.  The people you interacted with during your stay here may have been largely vegetarian,  but  South India is hardly ""inclined"" to either vegetarianism or abstinence from alcohol, the way the OP describes Japan as being ""inclined to "" non vegetarianism.Show me any locality in Bangalore and I'll find you a couple of dozen non  vegetarian restaurants in a 5 km radius. And lots of liquor shops.<p>I've lived here 35+ years. I should know.<p>I'll grant you that you may not get a steak done the way you want it, but hey I can't get a Masala Dosa in the average restaurant in Arizona.

Beef is <i>slightly</i> rarer (but again not in Kerala). You need to distinguish ""meat"" from the ""exact dish I eat in New York"".
I was saying there was plenty of <i>meat</i> In Bangalore, not sausages made Chicago Style (or whatever). Meat does not dominate the menu as much as in the West, but it <i>is</i> easily available almost everywhere.<p>Some <i>communities</i> of people, e.g Brahmins or Jains or Buddhists are vegetarians.

In the simplest sense, Dehydra can be thought of as a semantic grep tool. It presents a wealth of semantic information that can be queried with concise JavaScripts. It is also useful to find bugs in source code as it allows for much more error checking than C++ is capable of by itself. Dehydra is built as a GCC plugin, thus it is easy to use for projects that already support GCC.
Dehydra is also useful for generating language bindings and is used to bootstrap Treehydra, a heavy-duty static analysis GCC plugin.</i>",1268064359

3591961,story,,,7,6,marcamillion,"If you are a hacker, exercise is not as hard as you think",,"By 'the new' definition, a hacker is someone that builds stuff.<p>Part of the process of building stuff is tackling (and persevering on) problems that seem insurmountable for a number of reasons. Either you don't have the technical chops for one particular thing, or customers seem elusive or marketing seems bizarre.<p>Either way, part of being a hacker is just figuring it out. i.e. it is having the mental strength to push through.<p>That's all exercise is. It's about 80% mental, 20% physical.<p>I have led a sedentary lifestyle for at least the last 8 years (or more my wife would argue) and while I am still 'relatively young' (28), exercising was not something I was fond of (in the least). Perhaps it is partly due to my asthma (cliched...yes...I know), but I think it was because I overestimated the challenge.<p>Now that I have been exercising for the last 2 - 3 weeks, I have found that the hard part is starting (and being consistent day-in, day-out). But....the hard part is mental. Not so much physical (for me anyway). Programming and problem solving is also mentally taxing for me, so I realized that I developed the skills to deal with the mental roadblocks. It's the same ones I use when deciding to start working on something that has been stumping me. I have been doing that for the last few years - so while it's a bit uncomfortable, it's become a habit.<p>Now that I look at exercise like that - it's much easier to get up and do it.<p>Don't push yourself too hard right out the gate, and know your limits - if you feel dizzy and light-headed, that's your limit. Don't always push yourself to your limit at first.<p>Just do as much as you can. The important thing is not so much what you do initially, it's doing it every day (or 5 days for the week).<p>So...go be healthy. Just start...and keep starting.",1329256554

I'm letting him completely define the plot, the characters, the actions, and overall requirements no matter how nonsensical it all seems, I don't debate his choices, I just take requirements as is. I have him involved with every step from designing the artwork, the music, the sounds, the actions, and he is quite obsessed with working on this project continuaously. I don't expect he'll know all the details of how the game works but I want to demonstrate that he can create fun things using a computer.<p>The refreshing part of getting software requirements from a child is there's no tedious debate about implementation details, timelines, and business value.

This way I don't have to scroll past all the books I have already looked through (not as big of a deal at the moment, but I could see it becoming an issue as the collection of books grows).<p>Also as you add features to the site, an option for browsing books in a 'grid view' rather than just a list could potentially be useful.

Most of the time, even if you went to sleep early, there will be some internal resistance to actually leaving the bed (it's warm :)<p>If you put the alarm far away, then you are forced to get up, and by that point you've already fought most of the resistance to actually getting up.  Problem there is that the visual clock is too far away from the bed.<p>The real problem that this solves is decoupling the physical clock presence from the alarm silence mechanism, forcing you to physically leave the bed.

Most tourist areas and theme parks have lots of upcharge attractions of this sort.  The scarcity of their limited capacity drives prices up.  (Remember, in capitalism, prices are set by supply and demand, not by cost.)<p>This sort of service-intensive experience requires a large density of premium customers to justify going for that over a more mass-market entertainment approach.  Indeed, theme parks themselves are moving more and more towards the theater model, because that scales so much better with much more capacity.  Disney and Six Flags and Universal have upgraded many parks with huge theaters and shows.  The best roller coasters and dark rides can run around 2,000 guests per hour; a theater show can hold 5,000 or more with minimal line-waiting.<p>Just like software, a capitalist can duplicate the movie experience for thousands of watchers at nearly no marginal cost.  Compare that to a Broadway play which requires a hundred paid workers to stage a more personal performance.  Broadway does exist thanks to New York's density of wealth, but that's the exception.  Every town has a movie theater, because the pricing fits into everybody's everyday budget, and the physical hardware is easily constantly repurposed to a new movie.",1329255383

So you don't have to read books and search for tutorials on how to do basic stuff like inheritance and choose from a zillion library options. Using coffescript you can at least learn the top best practices in one place.<p>If you're using prototypal inheritance to do the equivalent of classical inheritance, it would be nice to just say what you mean - class and super. The JS language committee seems to hold this viewpoint, say what you mean with keywords, instead of low level blah.prototype, blah.prototype.call(this). The multitude of libraries handling this are inconsistent. If you read Crockford, you might choose the style where everything private is in a closure, you're not using prototype and taking a performance hit. Then if you do need performance, if you have hundreds of instances, Crockford just screwed you and refactoring should make you bitter.<p>Jeremy's own underscore has _.extend which is the cleanest, but to control the wild west JS out there, the language should enforce one true way.<p>Nobody wants to know that ugly low level detail of blah.call(this). I can't think of one example of JS code not using the equivalent of classical inheritance. All these arguments against CoffeeScript seem silly when the official language committee is adopting bits and pieces of it where they can. If they could adopt the whole thing, they probably would.<p>CoffeeScript's real problem is debugging. No one complains much about it, but it would be smoother to see bugs in CS instead of the generated JS.",1329254979

Comparing it to the United States' -- a system that really isn't so good either -- doesn't even begin to describe how serious the problems are in it.<p>Industry groups complain that 90% of college graduates (75% of college engineering graduates) are <i>completely unemployable</i>.  Not merely untrained, but <i>not even worth training</i>.  One of the major industry training companies has recently increased their training period to a full <i>7 months</i>.<p>Plagiarism is endemic and encouraged on every level, from the Dean down, <i>even in graduate schools</i>.  Most students write papers by copying off the internet and citing ""Google"".  Many ""programming"" students assemble programs by begging for ""the codez"" or otherwise copying ""the codez"" from existing projects.  Professors rarely bat an eye when the entire class turns in the same work.<p>By comparison, in America, plagiarism is looked down upon and stigmatized from as early as the start of elementary school.  It's still a major problem, but it's not <i>socially expected</i> in the same way that it's become in India.<p>In this kind of environment, it's not surprising that ""coders"" are being trained rather than ""programmers"".  Programming is about problem-solving, and it's hard to teach problem-solving in an educational system that revolves largely around copying other peoples' work in place of solving problems.<p>A few of the best students manage to succeed -- after all, even a broken system can't stop some of the smartest and most motivated from succeeding.  But even for them, the soul-sucking nature of such a system can hardly be encouraging, and it does no favors for their job prospects -- since being ""Indian"" carries the stigma of being a product of that broken system, even if you managed to become a great programmer regardless.<p>HN often likes to demonize traditional education, but the most important role of education is not to teach skills, but to <i>teach you to think</i>.  That is the purpose of writing a 10-page critical analysis of a theme in a Shakespeare play, or building a toy memory allocator: not because knowing Shakespeare or being able to write malloc is important, but because it teaches students to <i>think</i> and <i>analyze</i>.  By plagiarizing papers and programs, students completely miss the point of the exercise -- to learn to think!<p>Indian colleges are by and large failing this primary responsibility of education, and their students suffer as a result.  In true cargo cult fashion, they have adopted the trappings of education without understanding the real purpose behind it.",1329253543

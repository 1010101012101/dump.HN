I just feel like judging a person just because they use a particular turn of phrase is kind of awful, especially when, as the article explains, they are actually using the phrase in a highly subtle and expressive way, which the entire speech community implicitly agrees on (and has agreed on for hundreds of years, in this case).<p>I don't see how it's any more insulting for me to say that my pet peeve is people like you than it is for you to say that your pet peeve is people who say 'literally'. In any event I'm not proclaiming you ignorant as an insult or name-calling -- I'm simply stating that I believe it's ignorant to think less of a person because you don't think their usage makes 'logical' sense. Language is a locus of communicative intent and its purpose is being achieved marvelously by this usage: otherwise people would not be using it.",1233535827

Better software is only going to happen in addition to software that exists already - i.e. more software, leading to (I suggest) more complexity.<p>Filesystems work. At least, Windows simple filesystems work, Linux's mess is less pleasant. People who want to can learn to put files in My Documents and find them later - it's not massively complex, there's a place for shared documents, a place for your documents, a place for Programs and a place for Windows. That's about all you need to care about.<p>At some point I object to the ""Why should people learn anything? It's all the failings of the computer!!!!"" attitude of your comment - there's always a trade off - any alternative will come with alternative problems. A more complex system (e.g. context awareness) will have more complex problems with it.<p>I often wish for more context awareness in software, but when I stop and try to visualise it in detail, it seems much less desirable.",1233535770

Because you can bet that some gossip rag like Valleywag will eventually run a story like ""Is Disney sponsoring porn?"" all about how a company that Disney does business with has some lead developer whose side project is a porn site.  Elsewhere on the thread I say that reasonable people ""decay"" relationships by social distance.  Well, tabloids are not reasonable people.<p>IIRC we had an issue with this at FictionAlley.  We had a sister site called RestrictedSection.org that was for NC-17 HP fanfiction.  It was a separate organization but had many of the same people involved, and we'd help each other with technical stuff and such.  When FA got Warner Brother's blessing, part of the condition was that there would never be anything more than R-rated on the site, and we needed a warning for anything more than PG-13.  And concurrent with that, a wall went up between FA and RS.org - you had to pick one to be involved in, and we didn't help each other out so much any more.

461665,comment,461518,461518,0,0,rubing,,,"6 years ago I was at a crossroads in my life...wondering if I should pursue a career in IT.  Ultimately, I decided not to, since I realized that anybody anywhere in the world could learn all the programing and development skills needed to be an IT professional.  Instead, I went into the health sciences and now have a shot at a decent career. I still love tech and am trying to find the time to learn LISP, hopefully I can leverage that into a new practical application in my field. I completely empathize with the frustration the author of this craigslist posting has.  Unfortunately, there are so many poor and intelligent people around the world who are willing to work their butts off for relatively little. US citizens who work in tech would be helped out if the government stopped renewing H1-B Visas.  It is not fair to the tech workers here to compete with third world labor.

Central planning doesn't work due to information problems (lack of prices), and freedom issues.

Second, a lot of people object to forcing people to do things at the point of a gun.<p>Productivity & Wage Increase\nI think you are missing a fundamental point, when productivity increases it is normally the result of a capital investment.  The person who makes that investment is the one who profits, not normally the person whose productivity has increased.  For instance if I'm making shoes, and my boss buys a machine that allows me to increase my productivity 10 fold, well he will see most of that reward while I may see a small increase in my wages.

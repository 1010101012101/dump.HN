He never wrote the same line of code twice, writing standard functions and reusable components.  If he knew he needed something twice, he wrote a parameter-driven code generator on the fly and had me collect the parameters for him.  He even coded in Boolean algebra and had an engine that converted it into production source code.  He threw things into production long before anyone else would, figuring it was easier to just keep reworking them instead of waiting until it was perfect.<p>He was a one man shop in a $150 million company.

I mowed a ton of lawns to get a hard drive for that machine.  Shortly thereafter, I received a 486 and a handful of Walnut Creek CDs of various (dated) Linux/BSD distributions.  I'm still not sure how those CDs came into my possession, I believe they were passed on to me from a friend.<p>I spent some time BBSing and learning to write shell scripts.  On a couple of BBSes, I read hacking and phreaking text files and started to learn C/Assembly.  It was free knowledge as our library was lacking in tech books and I rarely got to go to a bookstore.  I also developed a fascination with radio, telephony, and basic electronics.<p>Three to four years later, the family decided it was time we had a computer (that we could all use).  They picked up a 90Mhz box from HP that I promptly installed Linux on and used it to play games, program, and read any sort of documentation I could get my hands on.  I also branched out into Perl and started writing small applications with it.  We got Internet access about this time and I spent hours saving/absorbing documentation and tutorials from gopher/www/ftp sites.<p>In my late teens, I took on a job at the local Radio Shack repairing busted electronics.  I learned quite a bit there, but electronics these days are disposable, so I had to find other work.  I was doing penetration testing on the side for quick cash and ended up getting a contract for the City I lived in.  After I finished the job, I got hired on as an intern in the IT department while going through college.<p>In university, I carried a double major in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics while also attending the local community college for Network Administration.  I never finished either degree as I was offered a full time job as Network Administrator at the City.  I took the job, quit school, and got married.<p>During the year or two before I dropped out of school, I learned Ruby with some friends from the ACM at the university and began doing freelance development.<p>So here I am today, Network Administrator for a small municipality and part time freelance Ruby developer.

I'd suggest that this particular one is real-world as it's straight out of one of our applications. I've no intention of trying to be dishonest here - just offering the measurements of my (and our) internal evaluation of the tool for our needs.<p>While I can't provide the source of the task, I can offer the quick-and-dirty source of the quick little ""PyInvoker"" I'd whipped up (sorry - didn't realize there was something called PyInvoke at the time). It just takes a message, unpacks the JSON, and uses getattr to call the appropriate task. Nothing fancy like e-mail error notifications, retries, and the like: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/18a30689832569d67861"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/18a30689832569d67861</a><p>Anyhow, always and absolutely take any claims regarding the  performance of a tool with a massive grain of salt, and try them for yourself to see if they suit your needs. Octobot's not designed to replace background processing in most applications as tools like Celery and DelayedJob (both of which I use myself) are great, a bit easier to write for, and a bit simpler to get up and running, depending on the application and language being used.<p>There's no intention to have slighted anyone or any other project here. I'm stoked that a lot of tools exist in this space. I just hadn't seen one on the JVM that offered this level of simplicity and parallelism with a bit of restraint when it comes to feature creep. But if you have an application that demands high throughput / low latency execution of tasks, this might be worth evaluating.",1285004774

Don't give up hope or think that your are crazy. What you are experiencing can happen to anyone -- it happened to me and one of my friends had lighter, but similar symptoms too. You can get through this!<p>I don't know your situation, but something very similar happened to me when I was under a lot of stress, away from my family and after several relationships failures. My confidence level was so low and I think that was triggering the whole situation. I didn't trust myself anymore. I didn't trust I was doing simple things correctly. It's an extension to the problem ""Did I really lock the door?"", but with much deeper and frightening questions such as ""Did I really avoid that cyclist or did I hit him without noticing?"". Damn, I should really go back to the ""crime scene"" and make sure everything is fine! Yes, I did that and when I rationalized it I knew it was ridiculous, but the feeling of doubt and stress was so strong I somehow had to go back and check it out. I would look at my car for ""proofs"" of innocence like you. It could help a little bit, but there was always a new scratch somewhere that could trigger the doubts again. Back to square one. The thing is, you do not want to train your mind to continue with this line of thoughts. Finding ""proof"" or going back to the ""scene"" only adds confirmation that there is potentially a real situation when we both know there isn't. It stimulates the brain, triggers other questions, etc. You want to break the pattern <i>as soon as possible</i>. The more you encourage your mind, the more questions, the more stress, the more doubts you will feel. I will give you some tricks that helped me tremendously.<p>As soon as the symptoms appear, recognize them. Know what they are. Not feelings of something real, but something your mind is creating.<p>As soon as doubts appear in your mind, try to dismiss them (I know this is hard). Fight them. Never encourage them by looking for proof or going back. What helped me: running a 5k asap or calling a friend, but more importantly stop caring. I said to myself: You know what, you did your best. You drove the best you could and if this ""accident"" really happened so be it. I didn't mean to and I'll pay for the consequences. I know it didn't happen, but if it really did so be it. I'll deal with whatever punishment. etc. You have to train your brain not to worry. Not to care, because it's not real anyways (you know it rationally, you have to use that to your advantage and train your brain).<p>Also, always remember that if what you think happened <i>really</i> happened you would know. Yes, in addition to feeling guilt and stress, you would know exactly how it happened. There would be memories. Sounds. Images. Odors. Understand that it's totally impossible to kill someone without realizing it. Impossible.<p>The sooner you stop encouraging your brain, the sooner the symptoms will disappear. For me, at first it took a few days. Then a few hours. And know not even a second. It's not instantaneous, but once you know the symptoms and act on them they will disappear eventually. And at some point they will disappear instantly.<p>Don't give up!",1285004022

We live amongst unimaginable competition where getting a job is not a given; it's a privilege that you earn. And creating a job i.e. entrepreneurship - good luck.<p>We live in those conditions.

>companies in exchange for a meager pension after 30 years.<p>I do not see the loyalty that you speak of. I see a craving for security. I see a strong desire to stay at one place for 15 years (or 20, or 30). I know a lot of people for whom work is not the #1 priority. (I am not judging these people. They are all healthier, happier, nicer and more sane than I am.) For some of the younger ones, there priorities might be:<p>1.) education<p>2.) romantic partner<p>3.) family<p>4.) social life<p>5.) hobbies (motor cycle racing, video games, knitting, yoga, jogging, sailing, fishing, etc)<p>6.) work<p>For some of the older ones, their priorities might be:<p>1.) children<p>2.) romantic partner<p>3.) parents (if parents are still alive)<p>4.) social life<p>5.) hobbies (motor cycle racing, video games, knitting, yoga, jogging, sailing, fishing, etc)<p>6.) work<p>Work is nowhere near their top priority, though the money it provides forms the basis of everything else they do. But their focus is on the ""everything else"" rather than the work.<p>To jump around from job to job usually means that work is your #1 priority (or maybe #2). It means you need to keep your skills razor sharp and up-to-date. It means you constantly confront the realities of the market. A great surfer doesn't daydream when they are riding a dangerous wave - that would get them killed. Likewise, a successful freelancer doesn't ignore the market - that will get them killed financially.<p>But, again, when I say all this, I'm not being judgmental about the folks for whom work is the #5th or #6th or #7th priority. I've several friends in that category, and they are all healthier, happier, nicer and more sane than I am.<p>But I do not see the loyalty you speak of. To be truly loyal, these folks would make work their #1 priority and would give 100% of their energy to the corporation. There are exceptions, but that is not what I generally see. In the last 10 years, I've twice worked stints in big corporations. What I saw were a lot of people who  would work a strict 9-to-5 schedule, and they would be gone by 4:30 on Fridays. They gave the corporations the minimum effort to keep the job, rather than giving 100% of what they were capable of. That is not what I would describe as loyalty. However, the corporations were in no way loyal to the workers, so the worker's lack of loyalty was wholly rational and entirely justified.<p>The relationship between big corporations and their workers can get dysfunctional. I see that as one of the big problems that big corporations need to wrestle with - possibly the biggest problem that large organizations face is this problem of motivation. Small companies have a different set of problems.",1285003932

  vector<Rect> v;
  for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i)
    v.push_back(Rect(Point(i, i), Point(i + 1, i + 1)));

  Java:
  List<Rect> v = new ArrayList<Rect>();
  for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i)
    v.add(new Rect(new Point(i, i), new Point(i + 1, i + 1)));
</code></pre>
On a 64 bit machine, the C++ vector will use 16MB of RAM whilst the Java List will use around 48MB of RAM. Also, the C++ Rects will be tight, that is located next to each other in memory and can be iterated over very cache efficiently. The Java Rects will be all over the place. Iterating over them might cause a very large number of cache misses.<p>[Edit] Actually, I belive the Java list will take even more space because I forgot the per object overhead for the Point objects, which is 8 bytes each (in addition to the pointers).

We used some sort of IBM PCs (I have no idea what they were, I just remember booting them up with a 5.5"" floppy and having to punch in the correct time as it booted) and typing in the BASIC commands the teacher wrote on the board.<p>In eighth grade, me and a buddy spent way to much time programming a 'choose your own adventure' story in BASIC on an Apple IIe. Something from that fifth grade class must have stuck. For some reason though, I never connected what I was doing with computer science. I guess I thought I was just playing around with a toy or something, so when my college adviser suggested I major in Computer Science, I said no way.<p>At some point during High School I'd gotten my hands on a copy of Photoshop, Version 3 I think. That somehow led me to major in Information Design, which oddly was in the school of journalism. I took classes on print and web design, some flash even, but most of the curriculum was journalism-oriented.<p>After college I worked in newspapers for about six years, creating info graphics and designing pages, but I was always involved in any IT project that came along. I helped setup a content management system, upgrade servers, etc.<p>I also started in newspapers right about the time their downhill slide started. The conversation du jour was always about how newspapers could make it online. Eventually I transitioned to working on Flash projects, learning Actionscript 3 (basically ECMA script) and eventually taking some .net classes at a community college to learn about object-oriented coding and all that.<p>Now I work for the state IT department and have a few side projects going as well. Someday I might actually post one here. I'm more of a designer than a programmer, but I think where I've landed - at least for now - fits my strengths very well. I still wonder what would have happened if I had majored in CS from the beginning, but I would have probably missed out on some fun traveling and great experiences that I had while newspapering.",1285002894

Just he ability to add a column on a large table without locking the thing for a huge amount of time would be great for us. PostgreSQL can also use multiple indexes which, again, is a serious plus. The error messages that PostgreSQL returns can be much more informative than MySQL. At times when you screw up a query instead of ""this is impossible"" or ""you can't do that"", you get something more akin to ""this is impossible because of X"". Again, this is just my impression. Basically, PostgreSQL feels more like an open source Oracle (a grown up database) than MySQL (which doesn't feel very Oracle-y).<p>Now the tools are MUCH less friendly, but if you come from an Oracle (or probably DB2) world you'll be used to it.

The only difference with DonorsChoose is that we actually give donors a say in how we spend their donation: on overhead, on materials sent to a specific classroom, or a combination. (Donors can decide to send a donation specifically to cover DonorsChoose overhead, in which case all the money goes into our general fund). The donor may also decide to donate to more than one proposal --- it could be two or three or five or ten proposals at once. That is also one credit card charge.<p>I really don't see why you assume that because the money being donated is spent on multiple things that would be separate credit card charges. That makes no sense, who does that? I can't think of any e-commerce site either in the commercial or non-profit space that would do this for no apparent reason.<p>I might add that, though I think this is more or less irrelevant, DonorsChoose does not send the money directly to teachers, but instead purchases the materials itself and has them shipped to the teachers (this is to reduce the incidence of fraud, and to make sure the money is spent on the materials the teacher said they would spend the money on --- the specific materials are chosen by the teacher, but we actually do the purchasing). If a donor specified all their donation go to the teacher and students, then the money they donate goes only to the vendor(s) for that proposal, who then ship goods to the teacher at their school, and the money we spend on staff expenses, web hosting, etc., etc. has to come from donations earmarked for overhead (including the optional donations).",1285002612

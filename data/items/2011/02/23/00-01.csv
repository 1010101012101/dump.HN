I think such large forums are breaking new ground, socially, in ways that do not compare to sites like Facebook.  Where else can I actually speak with my 80K closest friends?  If I am in a room of 500 at work (and not on the stage, because I am not one of the big wigs), only a handful of people around me can hear anything I say.  We all can listen to the presentation, but we cannot converse.  Here, any and all of us can converse.  It is unlike anything you can do ""IRL"".

After beta feedback  it must have become clear to them that it made sense for them to rewrite from the ground up.

They then provided plenty of info on how herokugarden users could migrate to the new Heroku platform for free too. I'm sure they learnt a lot early on about what direction they needed to take the Heroku platform. Anyone remember the web based code editor? Without the early feedback from beta users perhaps they would have pushed more in that direction instead of changing course towards the Heroku we all know and love today.",1298422051

There's a ""basic TP"" niche and a ""premium TP"" niche -- and maybe a couple more, but not many.<p>Okay, you say, since no two products are exactly identical, how is my talk of niches not vacuous?  Because it's not enough for the products not to be identical: they must be differentiated in the mind of the market.  That is, the differences must <i>matter</i> to at least some part of the market.  If you have a small market share, and you are unable to differentiate your product from its competition in some way -- price or features or both -- your market share <i>will</i> go to zero.  The world is littered with examples; I'm sure you can think of plenty yourself.<p>Ask any angel or VC you know what they think of a business plan that proposes to capture a small fraction of a huge market, without laying out a viable marketing plan for differentiating the product.",1298421720

Thing is, reddit already came out with an excellent solution with their subreddit system.  This simply wouldn't be an issue if there were different sections for tech, hacking, programming, startups, science, finance, and general interest.  Keep all of the deeply technical stuff in one place, the cruft in another.  Let's face it, the people who are complaining about lack fo deep tech are also likely to read and enjoy one of Spolsky's blog posts.  There's no need to ban the latter to protect the former, just keep them in separate sections.<p>Now, HN isn't trying to grow, so there's no need to have user-created subreddits (sections, I suppose).

The two features that lack the most are filtering and combinatorial game mechanics.<p>Filtering is necessary so it is easy for the the hardcore tech articles to be easily found by high-karma members, so they can vote those articles up. If it's not findable, it's not voteable. Filtering is also necessary for people to extract the most value out of hacker news. Most users don't want 100 front-page articles everyday. They probably want 10-20 of the highest value articles. Less is more.<p>Combinatorial game mechanics like those on StackOverflow would help as well.

Giving special voting/tagging/burying rights to distinguished members (very high-karma users and YC founders and employees) would go a long way to helping eliminate the crap.<p>I think I speak for most members here, when I say that I don't want Hacker News to be a democracy. I want it to be a technocracy. I want the smart and accomplished people to control what is good and should be visible to all.

2252297,comment,2250905,2250905,0,0,brc,,,"My take on this applies to just about any field with regards to entrepreneurship.  A successful entrepreneur doesn't emerge until the person 'gets it'.  What I mean by 'gets it' is an esoteric combination of these factors:<p>-realization that life is not a dress rehearsal<p>-determination to be successful in their own right, and to not spend the rest of their lives asking other people for permission to trade their precious time for wages<p>-awakening that most barriers to success are mental<p>-development of absolute belief that they alone are responsible for how they feel, how they act, and their success or failure at anything.<p>The big difference between this and other fields is the lower physical barriers to entry for young people.  There are no licences required, no physical assets to acquire, no permission needed to build software. On top of that there is a positive feedback loop where other people are willing to listen to a young software entrepreneur, because young software entrepreneurs have had success in the past.  If other industries had these low barriers to entry, I would expect to find young successful people across other industries.<p>The age distribution I think is just the varying age at which people 'get it'.  For some young people, they come out of the gates with this belief system, either innate or cultivated by their parents.  For others, it requires maybe starting a family and accepting the responsibility of the same, maybe getting fired from a job, maybe a mid-life crisis or a health scare.  The reasons are varied but the outcome is similar - a shifting of focus onto what is important.  Once the shift of focus happens and clear thinking emerges, the entrepreneur can emerge - at any age.",1298420684

(And there's 24/7 coverage.)  HN relies very heavily on a flagging system, but it's just not as responsive to stuff that is broken as is a human who's responsible for what's on the front page and what's in the comments.  Having a handful of humans who are responsible for curating the front page (and possibly also pinning really good stories from new onto the front page) would solve most of these problems.  Is this less democratic?  Sure it is.  Would the unfairness be worth it?  In my opinion, yes.<p>This problem just isn't solvable with code; it takes benevolent dictators.",1298419835

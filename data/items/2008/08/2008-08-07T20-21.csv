269998,comment,269775,269775,0,0,hugh,,,"This is a silly post. As others have said, there's no problem making ""most elements of the set P have property Q"", even when the set P is very large or infinite. ""Most real numbers are not integers. In fact, almost all real numbers are not integers.""<p>The problem with making pronouncements about ""most bloggers"" or ""most youtube videos"" is that we just don't know enough about those sets. They're large and new and rapidly-changing, and although many of us have experience with a large number of blogs or youtube videos, our experience is strongly biased towards the ones we find interesting, so we don't know much about the averages.",1218142691

It isn't filled with $20 knives. If you're using a tool for many hours a day, it pays to have a really nice tool. Even if it's only marginally nicer, that margin adds up. (It may never add up for the home cook, but that's another debate.)<p>But if you're making an order to fill out your kitchen, it's no surprise the cheap but fully functional knives will be ordered. $20 * 10 is a lot easier to justify than $100 * 10.",1218142616

You fortunate soul.<p>It's true, Apple could choose to run their platform more like Dell runs its third-party outlet, or Sony runs Playstation: With a relative handful of very strictly quality-controlled apps. We know they could do that if they wanted to, because they did so <i>all last year</i>... and they were met by an army of jailbreakers and lots of complaints from developers and advanced users. So now Apple is trying something else.<p>Having said that, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's approval policy tightens up in the future. Right now I believe they're still working through an enormous backlog. The easiest way to get through the backlog is to release apps unless there's an obvious reason not to.<p>In the meantime, why not develop a third-party rating service to pick out quality iPhone apps? If such a service is as valuable as you believe it is, and Apple's leaving that money on the table, why not pick it up?",1218142603

269993,comment,269184,269763,0,0,briansmith,,,"Let's say your employer lied to you in the interview, then fired you because you stuck to the original agreement. Then they lied about the reason they fired you so that you will have a difficult time getting unemployment benefits and you will have no reference to use for future interviews. What should you do?<p>A lawyer will be able to give you much better advise than I can. My guess is that your lawyer will help you get a nice little severance package and help ensure that your lying, cheating employer provides you with a solid reference to help you attain future employment.<p>I am not saying that you should get a lawyer so that you can sue them; I am just saying that a lawyer will be very helpful to understand the situation and for negotiating the terms of your departure. A lawyer's stationary is a very valuable negotiation tool.<p>Obviously, you should never sign anything or agree to anything, without your lawyer's advice. I think such a sneaky employer might try to trick you into signing away your rights immediately when they fire you. But, if you refuse to sign, what are they going to do? Fire you again?",1218142427

If you've raised a round and haven't announced it yet, then by all means, don't give it out.<p>However, for many startups, funding details will be public (and available via crunchbase or startupsearch) -- and generic ownership percentages can be pretty easily inferred. Asking whether investors own <10% or 10-40%, etc, isn't really saying much.<p>As for the rest of the information (mostly how the team relates to each other, their background, and previous work experience), I can't imagine this would be sensitive either, but if it is, by all means, don't give it out.",1218142378

I think you need to do it better though.<p>Now, that sounds bad at first glance, but only if you can't be trusted. If, of course, you can be trusted, then there is nothing wrong with tweaking your copy to be more convincing. Its really the only solution, its not like you can show a customer your server room or explain everything in detail. No matter how much jargon you put in, people still won't be convinced. But switch that jargon into marketing copy and phrase it the right way, and people will buy in that their data is safe. Is that a bad thing?

Also we might pay for extended validation certificate, maybe that will work better than our basic certificate to assure people in safety.<p>The only other thing I can think of is teaming up with some sort of a big, trusted name.

234131,comment,233145,233451,0,0,maw,,,"I think it mostly boils down to bad hiring decisions.  People -- mostly nonprogramming managers -- said ""hey, these guys are just as good and only cost a third as much"" and hired more or less indiscriminately.  (As with any other group of people, some Indians are smart, some less so.  Some are passionate about what they do; others view it as just a job.)  So they ended up with some guys who were indeed as good at one third of the price, and many more who weren't.  They got the same result, of course, as what they'd get hiring indiscriminately in wealthier countries.  I don't think companies with good hiring cultures have these problems, in India or anywhere else.<p>There are other problems with outsourcing to somewhere far away (which India is for many people): people will have stay up late or start very early to attend meetings, language can be an issue, and matters that are simple but take a few rounds of communication can end up taking days to resolve.<p>Those problems can all be managed with smart leadership, but when that's lacking, it's easier to point fingers at people with little chance of fairly defending themselves.",1215010779

I didn't use to think much of PHP (I prefer Python), but CI really makes it feel a bit like a real language and they have the best user guide documentation that I've seen for a framework.<p>If you have to use PHP, I do recommend trying CI-- we've had good experiences with the performance, but that's really not why we toyed with it. Django/Python has been good to us, too, but I was shocked to find that a PHP framework could work out so nicely.",1215010467

When you're designing software, if your primary goal is making it easy on your developers, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.<p>There is one situation, and one situation only, where XML is the right tool for the job. That situation is where a computer must produce and/or consume a file that must be read and/or written by a human. That's it. The only time. So, XHTML, ja. SOAP, nein. If a computer is consuming data another computer has produced, why would you want to encode that data in something so hard to parse, and so potentially ambiguous as XML? It's lunacy.",1215009822

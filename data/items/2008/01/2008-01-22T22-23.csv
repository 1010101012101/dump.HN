102495,comment,102410,102487,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"If we can keep just the UI in the Jaxer<->Browser world with logic and DB elsewhere, then this problem may be alleviated. I think that directly manipulating the DOM on the server, rather than working with raw HTML is the big win. Having the client and the server seeing eye-to-eye on the logical representation of the document being transmitted removes one of the many impedance mismatches in web programming.",1201042696

Acquisition offers are almost completely meaningless without an actual acquisition. Also agree with matt, raising $500 from your parents might be ""funding""",1201042664
102493,comment,102410,102410,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"Oh, this is very clever. It's a mozilla-based server-side DOM+Javascript implementation which mediates between a client browser and a backend http server. So you can do DOM manipulation and Javascript processing on the server, the client, or both. It supports connecting to local and remote web services so you can leverage your own backend or an external third-party site. And you can manipulate that DOM before sending the data back to your client! Interesting, very interesting.<p>It sounds promising as a way to tightly couple your server processing to your client display.  Transparently calling between the server and the client is an interesting approach.<p>My big concern is adding what seems like just another layer in your server stack. Aptana seems to think that Jaxer can replace other server-side technologies like PHP or RoR, but I'm not convinced. I also think that tightly interweaving your server and client could generate some massively ugly code and nearly unmaintainable codebases. Proper separation of concerns could be very tricky.<p>Now if they'll just get it running on Linux maybe I can check it out.",1201042479

102473,comment,102354,102461,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I have AT&T expressly because, of the two options in my town, it's the one that doesn't transfer-limit cap. The other option is the local cable company, which offers higher speeds, but caps monthly and bills for overages. I seriously hope AT&T doesn't follow suit.<p>I have no problem with a broadband provider capping speeds and managing their network. The problem I have with monthly transfer limits is that it is hard to keep track of your own usage. I would rather be throttled down than billed more, because being billed for overage is neither transparent nor easy to control. You implement a system like this, and suddenly all those open wireless networks in my apartment complex become interesting points of extra free bandwidth for me. Would I be so nefarious? Maybe not, but a lot of people would, and there is no way you can prove to the cable company that it wasn't you. Capping speed is transparent. I know that the speed of my connection is limited to 6mbps. I know how much I am paying for it. If that is overloading your network, add more capacity or lower the speed caps or hell, shape the traffic, but don't just charge extra for it and assume it'll work itself out.<p>So anyway, maybe these companies can milk it in the short term, but I have faith that in the long term, any time a company tries to hold back progress by abusing it's monopoly, they eventually get smashed.",1201040833

102469,comment,102259,102430,0,0,mojuba,,,"You mentioned intuition - so what is it anyway?<p>There is an interesting mechanism in our minds: when we find an algorithm for doing something and we do it often, the brain decides to hide it under the water - sort of passes it over to our subconsciousness. After that the algorithm or whatever calculations are performed there, in fact much, much faster - sometimes in orders of magnitude. This starts with walking, our first steps, and then continues on in whatever we do in our lives. Chess is no exception. Good hackers can intuitively - and very quickly - find bugs, etc. That's just subconsciousness with its high-performance computer. The only thing subc. needs from us is a well worked out algorithm - that's all.<p>So our intuitive moves or evaluations are just a result of a faster tree search which is performed ""under the water"". We are not aware of it - it's a subconscious process.<p>As for spatial vision of the board - of course we see the board and the position in its entirety, it's a spatial game after all. But whether this vision is of any help in deciding the next move in chess is a big question for me. Or show me exactly how that works. We sometimes can visually evaluate the position, but how accurate is that assessment? Something tells me that purely visual evaluations can be (and often are) wrong.<p>And yes, AI's heuristic is terrible, but the thing is, AIs (and why on Earth we call them AI?) do heuristic evaluation to cut branches in the tree search. If thorough search would be feasible, AIs would be able to give very precise evaluations, obviously. Meanwhile, we pre-program our AIs with best chess heuristics known today - something that can be beaten easily by genuises like Bobby Fischer.",1201039525
102468,comment,101506,102230,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Wow, a comment so long it needs a summary.  Here's the condensed version:  It takes lots of practice to be a good hacker.  Young (HS) girls have more pressure to be popular, which takes time away from recreational hacking.  Older (college and above) girls are at a disadvantage because they didn't start young.  They get discouraged and major in something else.  Repeat over a statistically significant population and voila!  Also, kids haven't lived long enough to accrue the practice.<p>Long version:<p>I'll bite.  While we can't how much of hacking (or anything) is because of innate abilities and how much is from practice, most of the research I've read says that excellence in any field comes from sustained (years) of meaningful practice.  This means that even if you're really smart, you need to spend lots of time to be really good.  And no matter how smart you are, if you don't spend time on something, you won't accidentally get good at it.  (nothing controversial so far)<p>So I'll make the claim that if men are statistically better hackers, it's because they're statistically more likely to have spent more time hacking (solve the children question).  It also explains why people in their 20s who have hacked meaningful projects are better than older, more ""experienced"" 9-to-5ers who do the same types of things over and over again and don't expand their knowledge and experience.<p>As for women, I would say that women statistically find greater rewards for pursuing other interests than computers.    More to the point, I would say that there is more pressure for girls to be attractive and popular than for guys, and greater consequences for not being so.  This both cultural and biological, and I believe that much of it is because most girls have to be asked out by guys.  So, average girl needs to be popular, and as pg explained in ""Why Nerds are Unpopular"" (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a>), being popular is a lot of work.  So much work that it crowds out everything else.<p>Fast forward to college, and girls that would then want to learn computers are at a disadvantage to guys that have been  hacking for years because they didn't bother taking the time to be popular.  They're mentally capable but years behind in practice, and it makes them feel inadequate, so they choose a different major.  Note:  this also works for guys that didn't hack in high school - they're at a disadvantage to those who did, no matter how smart they are.  Most people don't like discouragement so they go somewhere where that makes them feel better.<p>Thoughts?",1201039290
102467,comment,102315,102448,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"1. Without password and encryption keys, access to the hardware is meaningless from a data security perspective.<p>2. I am pretty confident that Amazon's ability to keep the computers running is better than most other options.  And unless their entire service goes down as well as the entire S3 grid, we can very quickly launch a new instance with no data loss (we have a hyperactive back up strategy to S3 to prevent data loss in case of an EC2 instance failure)<p>3. We can launch a new instance in a very few minutes.  So if anything, this seems like an ideal environment where uptime is extremely good, and in the case of a failure, recovery is extremely fast.  I'm not sure where we can get similar service?  The S3 is especially good in terms of multiple backups in different regions - hard to beat for assuring business clients who can't afford to loose data that their data won't be lost.",1201039219

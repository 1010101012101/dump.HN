1435299,comment,1434944,1435078,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> I think you might be missing the point.<p>I got his point, I just think he's wrong.<p>He says Google shifting from trying to compete from Blackberry/Microsoft to competing with Apple was basically an act of war, so Apple is justified in fighting back in the ad market.<p>I think that's wrong for three reasons - first, Google didn't go after Apple, they're building things people want. Their devices resemble Apple's more than Blackberry's because Apple is also doing what people want, whereas Blackberry isn't.<p>Second, it wasn't an act of war/betrayal/attack/breach of the Apple/Google business relationship (which Gruber implies).<p>Third, Apple are kind of being pricks pulling the rug out from a company after Google acquires them. They can do that because it's their business, but it's not justified as some sort of retaliatory measure. It is justified as business if they want, it's kind of prick-ish, but it's their right to do.<p>So, I understood, I just thought some of his points were wrong. I agree with him about not having comments on his site though - except in rare instances with a carefully built commenting community, comments become just noise and take away from a site. I like Gruber and have learned some really good stuff from him. I'm just not with him on this one.",1276689551

It certainly isn't the case everywhere. For instance, in the Church of England here in the UK the person who runs the church on the corner is probably poorer than most of the congregation. (Their salaries are very, very low. There's one big thing that makes up for that, which is that the church provides them with a house, usually quite a nice one.)<p>(Note: I am not any sort of apologist for the clergy; I am an outspoken atheist. But I have friends and family who work for churches, and I have a decent idea of how little they are paid.)",1276689400

My company has developed technology to extract structured data from business websites, data types such as postal addresses, contact details (person name, phone, fax, email, job title, headshot), company logo, products (product name, prices & descriptions), food and drink on menus, business description, keywords/tags and so on. There's a fair amount of text and language analysis, machine learning, clustering algorithms. We can process a million sites (~100 million pages) in a few days.<p>One of the pivots we were considering for this was Word/pdf docs, specifically CVs. We figured that these big recruitment companies and websites must have to process millions of loosely structured CV documents, and would need to extract specific data from these.

I like to stay current, not only on topics relevant to work but also on generic topics on life, society and culture. However this is consuming too much of my time every day, and lately I've noticed too that it ""trashes"" my attention and capacity to focus, by littering my head with so much input.

You can calculate your average commit and contributor volume on your own, or maybe write that into Kiln.<p>If your download count just increased to 1, that's because I accidentally clicked <i>between the headings</i> and got a .gz file with an attachment header from the server (wtf?).<p>I think the most important thing in the original article is the serious point that there are plenty of us out there who have to know and use all of the SCMs and tbh, they aren't really that different. All the ones I use in OSS do one major job: SCM. Even as you put it on your blog ""the enemy of git and mercurial"" (wtf?) subversion actually does a good job at this. For a long time it was king, too. In fact, I still miss the svn/trac combo, but Zeds point about this being a shit to setup and consuming way too much by way of server and admin resources is spot on the money. Not wanting some commercial venture to host it for you / or not liking their specific feature set is taste, but it won't stop anyone that matters from using your code, or submitting patches.<p>Man I should never come to HN, clearly.",1276686459

Installing DRM chips into your ink so that you can't use 3rd party supplies at all, nor refill your own 1st party inks and sue anyone who succesfully works around this under the DMCA: definitely a dick move.<p>Have you not noticed the widespread uproar about the price gouging on ink supplies? Your example of what's an appropriate business move is a textbook case illustrating the opposite.<p>The fact that you're more pro-Apple than Gruber on this should be a sign that you're out in the left-field. You'll need better arguments than inkjet manufactures do it too and the iPhone isn't public domain if you want to be convincing. Unless your argument is that not only can corporations do whatever they want but we have to like it too.",1276686046

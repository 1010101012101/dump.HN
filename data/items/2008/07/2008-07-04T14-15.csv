You probably had to maintain someone else's code at some point, got confused by the linker or debugger semantics, and decided you hated it.  [disclosure: I peeked at your blog and resume, and it seems I'm broadly correct.]  That's fine: work in C is grounded deeper than web development.  You don't have the scaffolding around you to provide a fallback for changes.  Sometimes you need to fix bugs from first principles, and that takes a lot more knowledge up front than web work does.<p>But that's not the same as saying that someone who <i>has</i> that background is as unproductive in C as you are.  Seriously: spend some time writing something serious in C, you might like it better.  It will certainly seem more powerful than it does to you right now.",1215183134

I'd be terrified to go that fast today, even with modern safety gear and a modern bike that's designed to be handled at high speeds.

236221,comment,236008,236023,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I think you're right. Google's page on how Trends works is pretty vague:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/trends/about.html#10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/intl/en/trends/about.html#10</a><p>... but it does include this bit:<p><i>9. Is the data normalized?</i><p><i>All results from Google Trends are normalized...</i><p><i>Remember, Google Trends shows users' propensity to search for a certain topic on Google on a relative basis. For example, just because a particular region isn't on the Top Regions list for the term ‘haircut’ doesn't necessarily mean that people there have decided to stage a mass rebellion against society's conventions. It could be that people in that region might not use Google to find a barber, use a different term when doing their searches, or simply search for so many other topics unrelated to haircuts, that searches for ‘haircut’ comprise a small portion of the search volume from that region as compared to other regions.</i><p>The last phrase of the last sentence is the key: It suggests that Google's ""traffic"" number is a percentage of the total number of searches. (And then they display that number on a relative scale by dividing it by its own average over the time period, removing it even further from the realm of the concrete.)<p>Ironically, right there on the Google Trends page for ""web hosting"" is a chart of the absolute rate with which the term has appeared in Google News stories over time. And that rate is increasing.<p>I'm not sure who deserves the most blame here: Google for publishing graphs that are practically useless, or the original poster for failing to read the fine print. I'd tend to blame Google, for making poorly labeled graphs with a limited choice of normalizing methods (i.e. ""no choice at all"").",1215180534

236218,comment,236158,236202,0,0,ulf,,,"I think the problem is not so much the low standard, but the lack of reliable tests for the personal aptitude, and this should not only be a problem in CS. Universities should spend a lot of effort prior to someone beginning their studies, to find out if the person really wants to do what they chose, in a way that the person itself realizes that quickly. This phenomenon is still huge in Germany, I started studying CS in 2002 and after one year, 60% of the people in my year had quit, mostly because they did not have any idea what was expecting them...",1215180306

The concept of feeling duty for ""one's country"" seems very weird when you look at it with some detachment. In a very literal sense, my loyalties end at my family, let alone my town, county, country, planet, or whatever.<p>In any case, modern wars are <i>far</i> less clear. In terms of this specific post, no-one from Vietnam was getting ready to invade or enslave the US or Europe. It could be argued Vietnam was a necessary show of force to demonstrate that the West wouldn't allow the USSR to mark its mark all around the world, but it'd be a tenuous argument at best.",1215180296

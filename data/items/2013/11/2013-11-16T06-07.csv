My name is Kirk Musngi and I am the Chief Technology Officer of NextDayBetter. (www.nextdaybetter.com)<p>I wanted to post the e-mail greeting that we sent to our hackathon attendees in the hopes of inspiring other devs and designers, in NYC and abroad, to join us in a weekend of building and helping first responders and victims involved in Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan. The attached link is our main blog post about the overall hackathon.<p>&quot;Bayani&quot; is the Tagalog for &quot;hero&quot;. &quot;Bayanihan&quot;, rooted in this word, means &quot;being a hero for one another&quot;. Thanks for your time, guys!<p>===<p>Are you pumped? We are. We&#x27;re excited to have you at tomorrow&#x27;s hackathon. Here&#x27;s what to expect.<p>The Challenge:  How might we build a more resilient Philippines?<p>Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) was unlike any storm before it. The unprecedented damage and the devastating impact on communities, revealed the true threat that weather events pose to communities, cities and regions across the Philippines.<p>While everyone affected by the storm continues to push forward with the slow and challenging recovery process, Typhoon Haiyan has made it clear that we cannot simply rebuild what existed before. When it comes to the sustained long-term rebuilding process of the regions affected by natural disaster, we need to be thinking different this time around, making sure that communities are resilient enough to rebound from future storms.<p>How might we build digital tools and supports to create a more resilient Philippines?<p>Location:<p>Projective Space

6743953,comment,6742514,6742514,1,0,COMS,,,"For the skeptics who say Stratfor is just a news organization, consider basic human psychology. These guys consider themselves to be private spies and they have the highest level connections.  Unchecked power naturally corrupts people.<p>Stratefor supports the GWOT and thus supports the defense industry. They may have acted like amateurs but they were actively training people to turn intelligence sources both in the US and overseas and then trading this information with whoever they wanted. You&#x27;d think some of their activities would violate federal law.<p>I&#x27;ve known a fair number of intelligence employees and contractors. In one strange area of aerospace, I witnessed some unbelievable things. Some things involving fraud. A lot with ego and bravado, using their connections for business deals and other favors. In one instance, I reported these activities to an investigator at the ODNI.<p>My experience with this is limited but from what I&#x27;ve seen, these types of individuals can do what they want with little concern of scrutiny. They&#x27;re on &quot;our&quot; side after all.<p>This is an old e-mail from Stratfor&#x27;s CEO.  However, I can&#x27;t see how anyone could defend them as being a &quot;news organization&quot; after reading it.  This is from George Friedman to Reva Bhalla (a young attractive woman) regarding an alleged Israeli intelligence source:<p>------------------<p>&quot;If this is a source you suspect may have value, you have to take control od him. Control means financial, sexual or psychological control to the point where he would reveal his sourcing and be tasked. This is difficult to do when you are known to be affiliated with an intelligence organization.<p>The decision on approach would not come from you but from your handler. This is because you&#x27;re position is too close to the source and your judgment by definition suspect. Each meeting would be planned between you and your handler and each meeting would have a specific goal not built around discussing the topic of interest which would ideally be hidden but in analyzing him personally and moving toward control.<p>The justification for the op would be specific classes of information and on gaining control the first step would be determining his access. If he failed the test contact would be terminated.<p>the problem of analysts in the field is that they tend to want to discuss the topic, which raises the targets awareness, rather than focus on establishing the control relationship.<p>So from a professional point of view this target knows your affiliation, understands your interests and you have not established any control which is defined as a high confidence in his obedience.<p>So washington is filled with gossip with people whose access is not established.<p>Just laying this out so you understand the core challenge. To be effective your goal is the person and not the subject. Otherwise its gossip which is information that you cannot definitively confirm.<p>This is intended to start our conversation on your next phase.&quot;<p><a href=""http://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/201031_.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/201031_.html</a>",1384583948

I call bullshit! &quot;[...] masters degree in sociology&quot; - I really wanted to stop reading after this line. There&#x27;s a handful of jobs that require only sociological skill and in most cases they don&#x27;t pay that much. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t know that should blame only themselves, not the system or the employers. Go google &quot;what can a sociology major do&quot;. Even Berkley&#x27;s (which I find to be a decent school at least) sociology dept&#x27;s website clearly states that sociology is only an addition to some other skills.<p>Not sure about other countries but in my homeland sociology studies are piss easy and that&#x27;s why they are so popular. People just want to have it all with zero effort. To the really small % of people who study it because they truly love it: 1) you either have to be the best at it in that case 2) if you&#x27;re not, then get a different job. Not everyone can make a living doing what they love the most. I love gaming but I doubt I could ever get to the point where I&#x27;d be able to make a living from it.<p>No jobs for people with a nursing degree, what?? All over Europe there&#x27;s a shortage of nurses! I&#x27;d love to read the whole story of that person. What she tried, what she did, where did she apply etc. It&#x27;s a hard job, that&#x27;s why there are shortages, but if you decided to go into a nursing school I&#x27;d guess you know that.<p>No one will hire you only because you have a degree, geez don&#x27;t people know that? Nowadays everyone can get a degree! Btw. why didn&#x27;t they mention in the article any university names? Anyway even if you, somehow, graduate from a distinguished uni but did nothing extra, or did not find what you really want to to then again you should only blame yourself.<p>As a European who did an exchange in France I met many Italians and Spanish during my life. They were usually quite hard working, focused and new what they want from life. And according to them they were the exceptions. Apparently the majority people from those countries recently prefer to party than work hard.<p>Young people seriously should stop acting like princesses and princes, taking things for granted just because they are <i>special</i> and instead try to do something by themselves.",1384583921

There were no charges filed. Again, his stepfather pulled the gun on his mother and threatened to kill his mother.<p>Saltzman decided that his stepfather should no longer have this firearm. He was likely to shoot and kill his mother. In June, he removed the gun from his stepfathers bedroom and then sold the gun, according to evidence, to feed his drug addiction. It was later used in a burglary.<p>His stepfather found the gun missing and notified the police. Police found the gun in the possession of the young man who had committed the burglary. Saltzman was then charged with armed burglary, grand theft of a firearm, and being a felon in possession of a firearmall for breaking into his own home and taking his stepfathers gun.

6743852,comment,6740324,6740324,2,0,gmarcus,,,"I am of the opinion that semantic markup is not an indicator of a quality product. Tradeoffs need to be evaluated including maintainability, code sharing, knowledge transfer and rapid prototyping among other factors. Purists that say no markup in HTML are constrained to a religion, just as any other <i>must do</i> that drive decisions. I argue that you employ not just the tools, but the techniques and strategies that will allow you to advance. Every situation is unique.<p>Regarding this technique...<p>In some circumstances, it is more than justified. Adding another layer of encapsulation can allow for a separation of concerns that may accelerate some stages of development.<p>I ask myself, is this more of a tooling question? If, we had a view of our stack that
a) allows for these encapsulations and
b) surfaces the right information at the right time
would we not make use of it?<p>For example, my personal frustration is that when building a new feature for Rails for example, I have to conceptually traverse the full stack (html/erb, css/sass, javascript/rjs, views, helpers, layouts, controllers, model, database) -- substitute your own versions these separations depending on your stack. That means that adding a new checkbox to a form could potentially touch 9 different layers! Do I really have to hunt and peck for 9 different files to add 1 checkbox? Oh yeah, don&#x27;t forget your tests...10!<p>I think that organizing the layers allows different experts to optimize different layers...a good thing!, but at the cost of being able to see 1 slice of the 10 layer cake.<p>I often search (and have not yet found) a set of tools that will allow me to view my stack depending on my current task and goals. I am not talking about edit/debug/optimize type views that come with some IDEs. I mean the logical grouping of all concerns related to my current feature.<p>This is a tooling issue in my opinion. Why can&#x27;t my editor give me the right view of my stack at the right time? At a minimum, let&#x27;s have our editors filter project files (and database views) depth first, grouped to all files that are relevant to the feature I am currently implementing. Sure, I can quick open and type out some names, but I would rather have my editor show me the relevant files (and only the relevant files) that make up my current slice of my cake.<p>Is there an editor, or plugin out there that will do this today?<p>Or what about 1 step further...
Instead of surfacing files, what about surfacing just the chunks of code that are relevant. What if my editor let me author bits of all parts of the stack for 1 feature in 1 logical file, and save it out to the traditional locations expected by my framework. I personally would be more efficient, and effective, if I could see my snippets of html/javascript/css/controller code/model code all in 1 tight view. No more would I have to keep all the connections in my head, they would be laid out right there in 1 file. Also required for this type of productivity would be simple ways to reuse and refactor.<p>Just looking for a tool that will let me have my cake and eat it too.",1384581763

I need to think over what you&#x27;ve written to grok the finer points, but here&#x27;s one I can talk to:<p>&quot;Why not replace (insert hugely established system) with (completely new system)&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s not a total rip-out-and-replace. Bitcoin might be the grease that enables the seriously broken parts of our struggling world economy to slip through the entrenched tax collectors and let the actual consumers reward the actual producers. It fills the niche of Community Currencies without the balkanization.<p>One thing that the huge, established system misunderstands about the new entrant is where the most effective inroads will happen:<p>The lower class.<p>Someone already richly rewarded by the establishment is not going to be very interested in Bitcoin (other than as a toy). But someone in a nation outside the US and Western Europe?<p>Bitcoin gives them first-world tools that completely bypass their local currency.<p>It sounds like the classic innovator&#x27;s dilemma. Suddenly trade barriers are being circumvented. Chinese currency can escape currency controls.

(I believe I originally got that figure in my head back from <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/break-cryonics-down.ht.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/break-cryonics-down.ht...</a>. -- I don't think it's an unreasonable one.)<p>I guess if you invent a few data figures and then do math on them, you can get an aggregate of your own opinion. It's like the Drake equation, except at least with the Drake equation there are some terms we actually know.<p>> It's still a better shot than being buried or cremated and worth it given the low prices available today.<p>Every dollar you pay for cryonics is a dollar that you're depriving your actual living children or family members, or it's a dollar you're depriving yourself of in the past modulo time value of money.<p>> Cryonics is a pretty poor business to be in if you're a charlatan. Where are you getting that vibe from?<p>It's the perfect business to be in if you're a charlatan! There's no way to tell if you're doing a good job or a bad job, you never have to provide any results (because those happen in the distant and undefined future), and your customers are already dead.<p>> I'm not going to touch your horrid comment that death is somehow necessary for progress.... Cryophobia is pure evil. It makes people choose death instead of cryonics.<p>Maybe it is horrid, but is it true? Ah, you don't even bother addressing that. Because as we all know, the most rational response to an argument is to accuse your opponent of ""evil"". It seems to me that even if you dress it up in science fiction and call it ""rationality"", religion is still religion.",1323136632

Since the input space that you type in is small, any one-way encryption is easily reversible. This means for every site that the code is good for, you would need to reveal a means to generate the code, rendering it the password problem all over again.<p>Alternatively, the key-fob could have an arrow to select which site to show the key for, but that would be cumbersome. Personally, I think that a solution similar to the ssh one would be best in that you have some sort of pass phrase that you type into your browser, and it unlocks a private key that can prove your credentials on web sites.",1323136546

None of my half-a-dozen Android phones have ever had locked boot loaders.<p>Yes, apps can make notifications. Remove the app, install another to block the adpush service.

Not all Android devices are made the same.<p>The SD card is also infuriating, but again, that's the beauty of Android.

My point is just that they probably view the TV market just the way they viewed the PC, phone and tablet markets: people think they are commoditized, but Apple can qualitatively improve the experience through both UI and manufacturing improvements. Then the margin in what was previously a race-to-the-bottom industry comes back -- and to Apple first.<p>Another obvious course for them to follow is to allow iOS apps to run directly on the TV. They just need a new input device so users can ""touch"" the screen while sitting in their sofa.<p>But I disagree with the end of your point #1.

Sony, LG or Panasonic could be a launch partner, but the aim would be to have every manufacturer clamouring to make compatible sets (as happens now with iPod speaker docks).<p>For the TV manufacturers, the advantage is they have another feature bullet-point to promote their hardware (TV manufacturers love their bullet-points and overly hyped feature names).<p>For Apple, it means they can stay in the business of selling $100 enabling devices for the iTunes store, rather than selling heavy, bulky TVs with razor thin margins.",1323135466

This means that people vote for the direction of our government. When doing so, many different issues are considered. Of these, most are probably outside the area of ones expertise. How can we expect good decisions made by people ignorant of the subjects in question? So we teach basic science, basic math, history, english, and the arts to everyone.

Despite not remembering much mathematics, for instance, how do we know that learning mathematical concepts did not leave a lasting effect on the brain? What about the lessons we learn from history class? We might not directly associate with them when making everyday decisions, but is it not possible that learning those lessons contributed to our current thought processes?<p>In summary, it is very difficult to quantify exactly what you retain from education and even harder to identify specific ways in which it helps you or helped to shape your mind.

So you’re right about that.<p>But we are talking about convenience methods and the aesthetics of code, as opposed to some infrastructure functionality (like an async library) or domain-specific functionality (like a state machine mixin).<p>It’s just a feeling on my part, but it makes much more sense to me in CoffeeScript than it does in JavaScript. It’s easier to write anonymous lambdas in CoffeeScript, so it’s cleaner to use .K and .T in CoffeeScript than if I have to encumber a line of code with braces and return keywords.<p>I wrote jQuery Combinators in old-fashioned JavaScript, so I can’t really dispute your suggestion, just share why I wrote it to appeal to CoffeeScript users.",1323133385

A hashed password sent over a secure channel is generally fine, though more complicated.  A password sent over an unsecured channel is not fine.  Neither is a hashed password sent over an unsecured channel.<p>Hashing the password before transmission gains you basically nothing.  Hashing on the client side simply means that your hashed password becomes the effective password.  Anyone who could theoretically sniff the password could also sniff the hashed password and perform the same kind of impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks.  You're introducing a bunch of complexity (and breaking compatibility with clients that don't, e.g., support Javascript), and you're getting nothing useful in return.  And yes, you could implement some kind of challenge-response and basically try to reimplement a secure handshake and auth, but you'll probably get it wrong because security implementations by laypeople are generally quite broken, and at the end of the day, you should just turn on SSL and do it the way that works.",1323133293

I've never had problems using my iPhone and Acrobits (using G.711u and G.711a audio codecs) and making calls to US/Canada numbers. As long as my WiFi connection is good then the call is great as they use the same Tier 1 carriers everyone else uses in the US.  If you're having problems with call quality it's probably an issue with your connection.",1323133290

They're shouldering what might be considered an unrealistic burden, but this is a potentially major way to improve performance - by recognizing the differences that lie within students and getting 'single-mother-on-welfare' to perform as well as 'book mcbook III'.",1323133274

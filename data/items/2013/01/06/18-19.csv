5017259,comment,5016676,5017138,4,0,green7ea,,,"When people say Linux, they usually mean more than just the kernel. Stallman insists we call this GNU/Linux since a good portion of userspace comes for the GNU project. When people say 'real linux' I believe they are referring to the full userspace that usually accompanies the Linux kernel.<p>The userspace in Android is very different from the userspace in GNU/Linux. In GNU/Linux, it is very easy to program using your preferred programming language. This isn't the case in Android, everything is very tightly wrapped up around Dalvik. Before you mention the NDK, let me say that it's only a subset of C++ (no exceptions among other things). Ubuntu on the cell phone also opens up the possibility of things like shell scripting, local webservers, etc.<p>What this really comes down to is programming freedom that you can find in GNU/Linux that isn't found in Android. You will now have a full fledged computer in your pocket instead of a limited device.",1357498708

This would be no different in your proposal only there will be exponentially more documents (agreements) to keep track of.<p>> and voting is not a realistic way to keep government accountable to the people.<p>Voting is not the only way to keep government accountable (legal action being another -- revolution or threat of revolution being yet another, civil disobedience etc, etc.), but as far as a basic way to make sure government will reflects the governed's will, voting does a decent job.  The evidence for this is that more extreme and direct action is relatively rare...at least in the West.<p>>An individual simply has no recourse to everyday government injustices (like taxation or prosecution for drug possession).<p>Taxation is an injustice?  How so?  I don't find it to be unjust.  I get a lot of value, personally, from the taxes I pay.  And drug possession?  I personally don't feel that drugs should be considered contraband but many people have.  Those laws are changing, however, through voting no less, as public opinion shifts.<p>>If you insist that government represents the people, fine, but it's still tyranny of the majority/plurality.<p>I live in the United States.  It is a Republic.  This means that while most laws flow from the majority and everyone must live under those laws the rights of minorities are protected.  Thus tyranny is held in check.  Also, minority and majority are fluid terms.  They are not so much tied to an individual as a gross bloc, but to individual opinions held by those individuals regarding the laws, rules and regulations under consideration.  The same person will find themselves in the majority on some issues and the minority in others.  In short, individuals often don't find their will wholly repressed by the rules of the majority.  Also, the rules tend to be slow to change and cannot be applied arbitrarily.  This is opposed to a tyranny where the rule is absolute, arbitrarily applied and make no room for unassailable rights.",1357498597

In fact, the interface is more expressive than the function as it describes more behavior than a simple function does. In both cases there is an ""inversion of control"" where the caller has to specify what object is passed in.

5017237,comment,5016716,5016716,10,0,h2s,,,"Testability isn't the only good thing about dependency injection. It's much easier to reason about OO code when objects only tend to interact with objects that they have been explicitly given. Too much willingness to introduce static dependencies increases the risk of creating classes with too many collaborators and/or responsibilities. This is a good example of how a testable design is often also a just plain good design.<p>Sure, the given examples of ""Time.now"" or ""new Date"" are innocuous and I agree that it's a good thing that Ruby allows us to write this type of code without creating a testability issue. But too many people abuse static dependencies for things like database connections which are:<p>1. well-suited to being represented as proper objects that are passed around<p>2. better off confined to a small area of the codebase<p>This is a complex issue and there's a delicate balance that needs to be struck. Otherwise you can end up with a codebase where a few classes are all up in everyone else's shit.

You can't argue against ""talent"" -- talented people are tautologically more capable than untalented people. If you don't want smart people making decisions, who do you want making them? Stupid people? Some unspecified different group of smart people under unspecified different conditions?<p>The article makes the strong point that certain reward systems are harmful. If you give anyone who shows strong short-term results a huge bonus and a promotion and anyone who doesn't a pink slip, you create an overwhelming incentive for people to fudge the numbers and take bad risks in order to stay on the A list. But that's not the same thing as hiring the best and brightest and then (perhaps after some probationary period) giving them the equivalent of tenure and autonomy as long as they don't start any major fires.<p>If the article can be summed up in a single paragraph, it's this:<p>""Groups don't write great novels, and a committee didn't come up with the theory of relativity. But companies work by different rules. They don't just create; they execute and compete and coordinate the efforts of many different people, and the organizations that are most successful at that task are the ones where the system <i>is</i> the star.""<p>Which is bullocks, because it's overly broad. ""Companies"" are not a uniform thing. If you're General Electric or NASA and you make jet engines and nuclear reactors and spacecraft, you need to run everything by the lawyers and the actuaries because if you make a mistake then literally planes fall out of the sky.<p>But you don't design web apps the same way as you design medical devices. The risk profiles are totally, comprehensively different. If a pacemaker fails, someone dies. If Google Maps is not available on your device, you just use Mapquest. Or a paper map. Or ask someone for directions. If some engineer collects wifi data that they probably ought not to have, again no one dies, and the ultimate outcomes in the case of ""collected and then deleted before being used"" vs. ""prevented by bureaucratic process from being collected"" are, as far as I am aware, completely identical for all parties other than from a public relations perspective.<p>When the cost of a mistake is low, it makes good sense to take more risks. If the damage that someone can do is smaller, you don't need to put so much effort into preventing it. Which is good -- it's efficient -- because having to check and double check is slow and expensive.<p>There are legitimately cases where it costs more to prevent a mistake than to clean it up. In those cases it is completely rational to allow mistakes to happen. Science needs negative results. Sometimes we need to be allowed to make mistakes in order to learn from them. And companies in such industries can do far worse than to act as a risk pooling apparatus for a loosely federated collection of small teams of individual inventors.<p>This is probably not a strategy that works well if you're making war machines or dangerous chemicals or massive scale financial transactions. But it seems to be a strategy that works well for making web apps.<p>I mean, they are making billions of dollars. Enron didn't make billions of dollars.

Maybe all your customers have smartphones, and if so you can ignore that, but at least you are aware of it.<p>(BTW, if you want another example of where the prediction goes insane: if you mosh to a server and then SSH from that server to another server, the latency between mosh and the remote client can no longer be measured by the protocol, and the prediction system gets very confused and mostly ends up turning off.

I talked to the developer about the issue, and it didn't seem like something that could be worked around (semantically, I'm not even certain it is possible).<p>(They also may have fixed some of the more insane ""visual artifacts"" mosh was getting when I was using it: every time you'd hit enter in bash it would do this totally-wrong prediction of ""take some characters and move them up a line, but not all of them"".

Why not stub out any global like this though? Because it breaks encapsulation and makes the program harder to understand.<p>Instead of lifting dependencies up to the level of method parameters with good composition, now you have to truly grok the entire method before you can have any confidence you even know what to stub out, and wether that's actually going to produce the expected results.<p>So while I fully endorse this specific, localized, easy to understand example, the poor composition of many Ruby libraries is what tends to make working with Ruby code so damn hard (IMO, see: Bundler). It's not enough to read method signatures. There are no explicit interfaces. Only implicit ones you devine by understanding the full breadth and scope of how parameter A is used in method B, all the way down the stack trace.<p>Fundamentally here DHH isn't talking about ""Dependency Injection"". He's talking about Composition and a pragmatic example of breaking Encapsulation. While sure there are 101 ways in which breaking Encapsulation can be a useful, pragmatic technique to employ for the seasoned code-slinger in the small, in the large it makes for more difficult to understand, and therefore less maintainable code.<p>I find many of these recent posts by DHH a bit ironic considering the subtext of a guy who read the PoEAA, then went off and wrote an MVC web-framework, packed with a nice Table Data Gateway, then proceeded to confuse Unit for Integration tests, and soap-box on the evils of Design Patterns in general.<p>[EDIT]<p>PS: The obvious example for making it easy to test, without breaking encapsulation, would simply be to avoid globals and use a default parameter.<p><pre><code>  def publish!(current_time = Time::now)\n    self.update published_at: current_time\n  end\n</code></pre>\nTA-DA. So trivial examples might show how a very shallow example of monkey-patching can be a nice convenience, you also have simple ""fixes"" that actually take _less_ code to implement.<p>You could easily come up with deeper stacks, presenting more difficult problems, but then you're not really making a great case for the beauty and simplicity of monkey patching if I have to have such a deep understanding of the side-effects in your code before I can even start making sense of your tests.",1357497474

That is what they are getting paid to do and are entrusted with certain powers.<p>It is funny how the tables were turned and the baseline was reset. Now somehow cops who don't fuck up need to be acknowledged and sent a fruit cake. The hidden assumption here is perhaps that everyone starts to accept that there a lot of corruption and screws up by cops (this is indicative by the focus on ""well there are a still some good cops, right, right...?"")<p>> Most of the stories I see that claim how the US is some type of a corrupt police state are selectively filtering and misreporting reality.<p>This is just the normalization of reporting. Before these stories were not reported and were covered up. If it weren't for citizens with cameras (phones) we would have not seen a lot of police brutality videos.<p>When US is claimed to be a corrupt police state that is often in comparison with its propaganda image or the image people imagine US should/could be.<p>Nobody is surprised if North Korean cops take bribes or torture someone. Nobody believe it is a state with the ""rule of law"" in it. But a lot of people are surprised if a cop in US does, because people (fortunately) still expect more from US law enforcement.<p>But as I pointed out that starts to change.",1357497275

That can, and really should, only be done once it's understood conceptually by other mathematicians.<p>There are people working on this, and they are making great strides.  I just get really frustrated when people think a) it's obvious that machine checking is the way to go, b) why don't mathematicians all work on producing their proofs in machine checkable form, c) I don't understand these proofs, so obviously machine checking is better, and d) it really can't be that hard - even I can see it's a good idea.<p>I have no doubt that this will change over the next 50 years, perhaps even over the next 20 years.

An example of this is after you hit enter: you might be running an entirely different program at this point.<p>In essence, the algorithm ""warms up"" as it makes correct decisions, and once it decides ""ok, my decisions seem accurate: when he types a character they seem to echo back to the terminal"" it makes a sudden transition from ""slightly slower than raw SSH"" to ""much faster than SSH and only slightly slower than a local screen session"".<p>These sudden transitions are jarring: when they happen to you with normal connections the expectation is ""oh, my connection is failing"", a feeling that with mosh you have every time you type a command.<p>Meanwhile, for the interactive-shell or complex-text-editor use case, these ""unpredictable events"" always happen at the worst possible moment: when you first start doing something; the result is that the perceived incidence of latency is actually worse than with normal SSH, as every ""new event"" has a higher latency... by the time it starts prediction, you are probably ""in the flow"" enough to not even be paying attention.<p>2) it relies on a specific range of UDP ports<p>Because it operates over a custom supposedly-mobile-optimized protocol, it tends to end up being inaccessible when you actually need it due to pervasive modern firewalls. You'll start a session at home, go to the office, and... nothing... because you can't communicate over that UDP port. This happened to me quite often while evaluating mosh.<p>3) it doesn't have a good way to reconnect later<p>While it supports sitting down at a different computer and taking over your session, it requires you to drop to a rather low-level mechanism based on knowing the secret session key that was established at the time the server was setup. This actually undermines the ""mobile"" use case, as it only lets the connection be mobile, not the session.<p>(I also have some specific issues with a library it relies on for spoofing hostnames in wtmp: just having that library installed on your system opens a vulnerability where any non-privileged user can spoof their hostname as anyone else... their opinion differs, but it seems to mostly be due to a knee-jerk reaction of ""you don't get fired for avoiding setuid"" than ""this is actually secure"".)<p>The result is that after spending a bunch of time testing it, working with the codebase, getting frustrated at a bunch of the design decisions, and then having it both totally fail to work in real-world network settings <i>and</i> become yet another source of infuriating latency, I pretty much dropped all interest in the project and replaced it with autossh, which worked great.<p><pre><code>    function cysh() {\n        AUTOSSH_GATETIME=0 autossh -M 0 -t -e none \\n            -o ServerAliveInterval=2 -o ServerAliveCountMax=4 \\n            ""$1"" screen -xRS ""$2""\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe primary downside of this is that it doesn't handle the packet loss problem well, as you are really just still using normal SSH to do the connections. The session might get weirdly slow and even lock up in these packet-loss situations.<p>However: it doesn't require any special code on the server, which is a downside of mosh I didn't even list above (as it is fairly obvious and something you know going in): this means you get to use it for every connection to every server you might ever care about.<p>Otherwise, you get everything you expect from normal ssh and screen: it works everywhere you might theoretically have been able to connect to the server anyway (so no ending up at the client site and finding out that they firewall UDP), it is obvious how to reconnect to (or even share) the screen session from a different computer or a different client without special software, and you don't need to even contemplate ""what if this introduces a security vulnerability by running a new daemon on my server?"".<p>The other annoyance of using autossh is it is pretty adamant about doing exponential back-off on reconnect, and in the naive way I have it setup in that function it is also going to be doing slow-to-fail DNS requests as it attempts to do the reconnection sequence, so the result is that the ""open laptop, wait for all terminals to connect"" sequence doesn't always click perfectly.<p>However, that is easily fixable by using a simpler wrapper (to be clear: use autossh when autossh is appropriate; it is designed, however, for server-to-server backend links to maintain persistent port forwarding), so I bring you cysh.sh, which is what I actually use (and which I've done some testing with others to verify works on random platforms):<p><a href=""http://test.saurik.com/hackernews/cysh.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://test.saurik.com/hackernews/cysh.sh</a><p>(Yes: you are now downloading a random shell script from someone on a web forum. However, it's like 35 lines of very easily readable sh: you should just read it; hell, after reading it, you might consider it so simple you just want to rewrite it for yourself. ;P)<p>You use this in the same way as the function, which I didn't even document earlier anyway as I knew I'd just be replacing it with this shell script by the end of the comment ;P.<p><pre><code>    cysh saurik@server.saurik.com stuff\n</code></pre>\nThis will reconnect to the existing session named stuff on server.saurik.com with the username saurik. It will disconnect other clients when it connects: if you don't want that, change -dRS to -xRS. It also disables normal screen control with ctrl-A (so it feels more like ""just a console""): if you don't want that, remove -e'\0\0'. If you want some other screen setting: just add it. ;P<p>(BTW, if you are curious why I have it set to do -dRS ""by default"" as opposed to -xRS, is that if you have multiple clients associated with the session the size of window can't be automatically updated; the result is that you often find yourself connecting back to copies of things like irssi or even bash prompts that are now the wrong width; -dRS works perfectly out of the box. Many people, however, know enough about screen that they love -x: if that includes you, you should definitely just change that.)<p>So, if you don't need the ""severe packet loss"" protection, I really think you are better off just passing on mosh and using something infinitely simpler cobbled over ssh. The latency mitigation feature are overrated or even annoying, and it seems many people actually just want mosh for ""easily auto-reconnecting mobile shell"", something you seriously can solve very well with a very short shell script and no special server-side logic.<p>(If anyone tries using that script, it doesn't work, and you want help debugging it, I'm happy to do so; that said, it is purposely not ""a product"" right now because different people seem to want different things, and it is frankly really simple to write this from scratch if you need it, or just kind of pull it apart and fix/change whatever you don't like about it: just attempting to get an automatically-reconnecting shell is a fairly simple problem.)",1357496788

Then the slowness of the Mac Air kinda shows. But otherwise, it's perfect. It's also ideal since I can push jobs to my desktop and use my Mac for personal stuff.",1357495799

5017039,comment,5015973,5016950,1,0,lmkg,,,"And I think the point that zimbu668 is making, is that such situations are still not unique to academia. Perverse or misaligned incentives are the norm in quite a few industries.<p>For example, sales guys are compensated based on sticker price, not profit margin, which means that the guy who sells $2MM of work for $1MM (i.e. at a loss) gets more commission than the guy who sells $0.5MM worth of work for $0.75MM. For another example, grading programmers by lines of code... 'nuf said ;). Another totally ubiquitous example: grading office workers by ass-in-seat time rather than value produced. Another also ubiquitous example: Departments in a company encouraged to spend as much money as they can at the end of the quarter, so their next budget doesn't get cut.<p>I could go on, but I'll stop here. The point is, even if ""publish or perish"" refers to misaligned incentives, that still means it's basically the same as 90% of other jobs out there.",1357495655

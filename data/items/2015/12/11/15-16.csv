Most people do this later in the day out of necessity or habit (e.g. 2-7), but there&#x27;s no reason your window couldn&#x27;t be 6-10.<p>The downside is that you are much more likely to cheat if you do this, because now you have to go all afternoon and evening without eating, and then go to sleep. Psychologically it&#x27;s much easier to wake up and be able to say &quot;only 6 more hours to eat&quot; and go to bed a few hours after your last meal than it is to eat your last meal, have 12 waking hours left, then try to go to sleep with a grumbling belly.<p>Edit: A lot of people practice IF without even realizing it. The most popular form (mentioned in rob_61&#x27;s linked article) is 16/8.

When credit crunches, people who were on the margins or even comfortably in debt end up in precarious positions where there is little help available, and the only bailout beneficiaries are big banks.<p>I suppose the reason far-right political groups benefit is because when people lose their possessions, all they are left with is their identity, and a lot of anger. This can feed resentment at any &quot;other&quot; group responsible for their travesty, whether it be a foreign power (WWI victors), internal distinct subgroup (Jews in Germany; Muslims in America/Europe; welfare recipients), or even religion (Arab Spring and ISIS being correlated with the global recession and rise in food prices).<p>History shows that any extreme cannot last forever, but it can do damage that lasts for generations.

You could Xerox it while competing copiers could effectively compete in the market by making a better product for value and getting fewer sales as a result of less marketing and brand recognition than what Xerox had, whose customers than pay an advertising and brand premium. Same with kleenex, or even search. The dominance of a competitor does not impair the competitions ability to compete unless those competitors use force of law to break a free market.<p>With Uber and Lyft, the more dominant Uber is, the less likely Lyft can get drivers and thus the less likely Lyft can get customers because Uber has all the customers and drivers. Its the same problem you have with operating systems, where you need the software users want, but the software also needs users to justify the investment, which is how Microsoft can continue to dominate with a demonstrably inferior product.<p>I&#x27;d love for there to be a way to break up mindshare monopolies, but destroying Uber through tax regulation and killing an entire fledgling industry is anything but a solution.",1449849384

The fact that the app would not function without drivers is definitely a meaningful one, though it also raises troubling questions over whether Ebay sellers (for example) should also be classified as employees.<p>Like you said, it&#x27;s a multi-pronged and complicated test. I actually think Uber could meet a majority of the IRS factors.[1]<p>Namely:<p>1. Instructions: Uber does not instruct drivers about when, where, or how to drive.<p>2. Training: by most reports, Uber provides no training to drivers. (In fact, this is an argument which Uber detractors often use against it.)<p>3. Services Rendered Personally: as far as I know, Uber doesn&#x27;t forbid you from hiring your friend to drive your car around with your Uber account open. (HIRING, SUPERVISING, AND PAYING ASSISTANTS might also apply here.)<p>4. Set Hours of Work: You can drive whenever you want.<p>5. Full Time Required: You can only drive a few hours a week.<p>6. Doing Work On Employer&#x27;s Premise: This test is somewhat less applicable, but Uber doesn&#x27;t require their drivers to (for example) come to a company HQ at the beginning of their shift.<p>7. Payment By Hour, Week, or Month: The bulk of driver payments depend on miles driven for customers, not hours &quot;worked.&quot;<p>8. PAYMENT OF BUSINESS AND/OR TRAVELING EXPENSES: Uber does not compensate drivers for any of their (substantial) expenses.<p>9. FURNISHING OF TOOLS AND MATERIALS: Drivers provide all their own equipment.<p>10. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT: This is arguable, but many drivers are known to buy new cars just to drive for Uber.<p>11. REALIZATION OF PROFIT OR LOSS: This is definitely plausible. If drivers don&#x27;t keep a firm grasp on their expenses or spend too much time driving around looking for riders, they can definitely suffer a loss.<p>12. WORKING FOR MORE THAN ONE FIRM AT A TIME: Uber drivers often simultaneously work for Lyft or other ridesharing services.<p>This isn&#x27;t cut-and-dry and we shouldn&#x27;t treat it as such.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.mdc.edu/hr/Operations/AFS/IRSFactorTest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mdc.edu/hr/Operations/AFS/IRSFactorTest.pdf</a>",1449848991

I assume at this point we&#x27;re heading into a situation that&#x27;s similar to a post-scarcity economy, so it&#x27;s inevitable that prices will have to collapse whether we want them to or not.

A bad Uber driver typically won&#x27;t last long in the job. There isn&#x27;t much that will get a bad taxi driver to stop driving. Eventually complaints might filter up to their boss or regulators, but it&#x27;s a much weaker mechanism.<p>I think the existing regulations were mostly put in place to compensate for information asymmetry. People get into a taxi unfamiliar with the driver, the car, reasonable costs, and the area. To ensure a minimum level of competence, drivers are regulated. To ensure people don&#x27;t get ripped off, fares are regulated. To ensure people don&#x27;t get driven on artificially expensive routes... well, that doesn&#x27;t seem to have been regulated very well.<p>Smartphones solve this better, though. Rather than some broad regulatory regime to ensure minimum competence from a random unknown driver, you can use an app to find out about your specific driver. To ensure you don&#x27;t get ripped off, you can use an app to get a fare estimate to your destination before you book. To ensure you don&#x27;t get driven on artificially expensive routes, you can just compare the route you take with the route your phone thinks you should take.<p>I wholeheartedly agree that we need an open market, not just another monopoly. But in doing so, we should take the lessons from Uber, <i>not</i> just the lessons from the past. The present looks a lot different. Any system which looks like traditional taxis and doesn&#x27;t take advantage of the easy flow of information is going to be inferior.",1449848540

Those problems arise from lack of activity, diet composition, and other factors beyond simply weight.

Why should I be forced to rent for $1k or $1,050 or something just because last year the person happened to be paying me $1,000/mo?<p>There should be plenty of notice if a landlord intends to raise the rent on an existing tenant (I don&#x27;t think even 6 months is onerous on the landlord), but if I want to double rent that should be my prerogative.<p>To be clear, doubling someone&#x27;s rent to $2k because they&#x27;re a minority so they leave then renting to someone else for $1,100 who isn&#x27;t a minority is a specific thing[0], and it is and should be illegal (in the US).

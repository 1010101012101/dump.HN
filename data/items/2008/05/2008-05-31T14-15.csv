On the one hand, force protection is the responsibility of any commander, and anything that contributes to that mission is a valuable asset.<p>But on the other, if we can go to war with no risk to ourselves, can we also resist the temptation to do so on the slightest pretext?",1212244474

It seems fast to me, but probably there is too little traffic right now to be able to judge its performances. Anyway, very slick execution. Congratulations.",1212243663

Reading puts me RIGHT to sleep.<p>Note that reading things online (RSS Feeds, Twitter, whatever) do NOT work :) They'll probably keep you more awake. Grab a good, or boring novel if that's your schtik and read it for 20 min while in bed. Puts me right to sleep on the days I can't get tired (Or just have sex that works too)",1212243213

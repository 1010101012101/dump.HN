I really doubt that more instances of FDR-like behavior will or won&#x27;t come about because of slight shifts in courtroom decorum.<p>To make a value judgement here: I think it&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable thing if courts became more accessible to the general population. Whether it be through relaxed attire, language, or physical layouts -- discarding some of the cultural detritus of rituals of years past wouldn&#x27;t bring the court system to it&#x27;s knees because of a lack of respect. Rather, it would show the general population that judicial on-goings aren&#x27;t some esoteric world that they need to think sacred. (Because really, why should they? The courts are for and by the people.)

I&#x27;ve done quite a lot of C++ work on Windows and embedded platforms, and a little on Linux.  Yet their HR wanted me to delete all that from my resume.<p>I didn&#x27;t just turn down the jobs.  Each time I explained to the recruiters - who generally are non-technical too - that all that other experience contributes to my ability to write OS X drivers.  Yet the recruiters were unwilling to pass on the message to the HR.<p>I&#x27;ve only known this to happen at just one company.<p>Actually I am quite good at explaining difficult concepts to the uninitiated, as a direct result of my experiences with many of my teachers.<p>I have a BA in Physics, with some graduate school.  I had some courses that I regarded as quite easy, some were quite difficult.  Quite often this was not the result of the material I studied, but the ability of the instructor to explain it.<p>Consider that physics is commonly taught by working out mathematical derivations.  That leads people who either don&#x27;t know math, or don&#x27;t like it, to regard physics as completely unapproachable.<p>But physics can be taught in a purely conceptual way, with no math at all.  For example, I once explained elementary particle physics to a Burgerville cashier by comparing it to the game of pool.  &quot;Suppose you cover the break&quot; - the initial positions of the balls, in a triangle - &quot;with a sheet of plywood.  Your job now is to shoot the cue ball underneath the wood, then determine the shape of the break from the tracks of the balls after they scatter out from underneath the sheet of wood.&quot;<p>She was quite pleased as she grasped it instantly.",1418935382

I found Johnson&#x27;s biography especially inspiring, as he is a man who grew up in a poor family, and worked very hard to become a highly respected aeronautical engineer, responsible for more innovative projects than any of his peers (before or since).  Some of the stories that stuck with me from his book were how his father (a bricklayer in the midwest) used to have to light a fire in a barrel to heat up bricks so that the mortar would adhere to them in the winter.  He also mentions that when he was a child (during the depression), he and his sister used to walk to the curves on the railroad tracks with their wagon, to pick up the coal that fell off trains so that they could heat their house.   The man worked his way through college in the kitchen of one of the fraternities, soon after contributed to the design of the Electra, and then the first American jet fighter to enter service (the P-80).",1418934131

8769440,comment,8768669,8768669,0,0,dcole2929,,,"I agree with the author here in principle. Being able to parse out what someone actually wants from what they ask for is key in pretty much any business type interaction. And as the author argues what is often the case is that people want to learn how to build something not Computer Science.<p>I have a sister in eleventh grade (16-17) who is interested in programming. But if I tried to teach her programming by going straight to data types and algorithms her eyes would glaze over. That&#x27;s not say she is dumb or traditional CS education is hard but it&#x27;s certainly not the most interesting of topics.<p>However I think the argument against starting by building things the author barely even glosses over. The ecosystem and tooling to build things has become so complicated that it makes it hard to start. Someone just learning programming is probably going to be bored to death by ints and bits, but they are likewise going to be equally discouraged by the amount of work outside of coding it takes to get any non-trivial web app up.<p>And honestly the same goes for mobile development too. It&#x27;s slightly less ridiculous but then you run into the issue of things that can&#x27;t be explained simply and get relegated to &quot;magic&quot; you don&#x27;t need to worry about... until you do.",1418934108

If the content changes by a single byte, even if semantically identical, the etag should change. Hence &#x27;{&quot;foo&quot;:1,&quot;bar&quot;:2}&#x27; is not equivalent to &#x27;{&quot;bar&quot;:2,&quot;foo&quot;:1}&#x27;. I can see serving such information directly, or embedding it into a larger JSON response.<p>2. Committed JSON files. This is an anti-pattern, but one I&#x27;ve seen many times. In one case, it was a translation file that was generated in a separate project. When I joined, it had been like that for more than 5 years. It was like that when I left, although I at least monkey patched REXML to emit sorted attributes in XML (also unordered in theory).<p>So while in practice, I don&#x27;t depend on a specific ordering, but I need the order (whatever it is) to be stable. For all I care, it could be sorted by the cryptographic hash of the keys, so long as it is consistent.<p>Just to gather what others have said here: JSONB appears to store fields sorted lexicographically for binary search purposes, and emits them in that order as well. This could be undocumented behavior, yet important for the above two use cases.",1418933134

However, right now the Internet seems to have no shortage of small businesses who claim they had never heard of this change until very recently. I can certainly understand that: I personally run two businesses that could potentially be affected by these changes, both already VAT registered, yet I have no indication that our government has made any attempt to notify either company in any way about these changes.<p>Even some on-line payment services and marketplaces appear to have had no idea, and it looks like some won&#x27;t be able to support the required taxation and record-keeping in time. These are the very organisations that many people in governments seem to have assumed will fix the problem because according to them almost every micro-business uses one!<p><i>This is one piece of legislation that could probably have been stopped or redirected quite early on, if those affected had just bothered to try.</i><p>I&#x27;m not convinced it would have helped even then. This is the same EU that imposed those mandatory cookie notices. More recently, they pushed through consumer protection regulations that mean if someone wants to buy a digital download and gives you their money today, the default is that you must not actually provide the data to them for two weeks, among other similarly unhelpful-to-anyone measures.<p>No doubt some of these measures were promoted with genuinely good intentions, but it is clear that the people writing the laws and regulations are completely disconnected from the realities of running a small business. It will be literally impossible for a lot of small businesses to comply with the letter of the law under some of the new rules.<p>The biggest irony of them all is that the most likely beneficiaries of these changes are... big US businesses, specifically those which function as on-line marketplaces and have the resources no small business does to investigate and comply with all the new taxation and reporting rules and to put up a serious legal fight if they are formally investigated for failing to do the impossible.",1418932950

Consider that my compressor was used in many subsequent projects for clients; we were also able to bid on jobs that would otherwise have required too many assets.<p>So in reality, my three weeks of work ultimately resulted in billable hours to clients, but not at the time I performed the work.<p>One more thing - these days it is quite rare to perform on the job training.

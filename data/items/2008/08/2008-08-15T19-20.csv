Most people have no idea how much money a scientist is or isn't making.<p>It is a valid neurosis, though. Even 20-25 years ago, a scientist wasn't that bad off, economically. My uncle made enough money to buy a house in the Bay Area as a microbiologist at a government lab. Nowadays there is no way  someone in the same position could buy a house in the same area. Even renting your own apartment would be painful. The salary has remained the same, whereas life has gotten much more expensive.",1218830376

Why is this so hard to understand?<p><i>If you do not have a valid certificate signed by a CA, SSL is not providing any security</i>.<p>Yes, the warning you get when you visit a site with an invalid cert is much scarier than what you see if you visit an unencrypted site. But it's the sites that use encryption that users care about, because <i>those are the sites that get their passwords and credit card numbers</i>.<p>Perhaps you think the browser should make an exception for self-signed certs. After all, there's nothing ""wrong"" with their signatures. Nothing's expired. No signature fails to validate. Why not just make the URL bar orange or something? <i>Because anyone can create a self-signed cert and sub it into a Bank of America SSL connection</i>.<p>It sure is annoying that you have to pay $20 every year to keep an SSL cert. I totally agree that this a problem. But right now, without that $20, you have a connection that provides cryptographically zero security. Short of coming up with a way to create a trustworthy CA that runs for less than $20 a year, there is no great solution to this problem.",1218830235

Then after the election ask people to check that their password is associated with the vote that they made. Even if only a fraction of voters do so, it would be hard for any potential vote rigger to tamper significantly with the process.<p>And on further thought, it would be better to use public-key cryptography than plain passwords -- get people to encrypt their vote with their private key -- because then the public keys could be released before the election and it could be verified that there are the same number of keys and registered voters.<p>This would be dramatically more secure than the current system.",1218829397

1)Application state and functionality abstracted into resources
2)Uniquely addressable resources using a universal syntax for use in hypermedia links
3)A uniform interface for resources for the transfer of state between the client and the resource.
4)A protocol which is client/server, stateless, cacheable and layered.<p>That seems like a pretty specific design criteria to me, and not at all dogmatic. Moreover, there have been a number of comparisons of REST Vs. Other architectural styles (see <a href=""http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/11/07/REST_vs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/11/07/REST_vs</a>). And a number of benefits of adhering to REST can be shown.<p>That said, obviously, like everything else it's not perfect, but it's easy for you to refer to people who advocate the architectural style as a working practice because you clearly don't fully understand it yet given quotes like, <i>It is a nice convention for pretty urls, for example</i>.

277246,comment,276002,276958,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"For example, recently I wrote a simple interpreter for a stack-based / postfix language kind of like Forth and Joy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_programming_language</a>) because I'm trying to get my mind around that language family* . It's still very basic and doesn't have much more built into it than the core Lisp PG discusses in The Roots of Lisp does (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html</a>), but I really noticed how the specific interplay of those sorts of forms end up setting much of the subsequent language. Lambda calculus, at least the passing acquaintance I have with it, has given me a conceptual vocabulary with which to think about evaluation, scoping, and which aspects of a language are redundant, can themselves be used to derive others, etc. I guess #2 could have been better said, ""Understanding these mathematical formalisms ... can be really helpful when ..."".<p>As a more concrete example, I originally had words (functions, so to speak) defined Forth-style, e.g.<p><pre><code>  : avg + 2 / ;
</code></pre>
Which roughly means, ""start recording (:) for a function called 'avg' in which we pop two numbers from the stack, add them, and push the result (+), then push the number 2, pop the two numbers on the stack and divide them (so sum/2), then stop recording (;)"". Then, I realized that once I added sytax to the lexer for lists (""blocks"") which are pushed onto the stack as one unit, I could instead use a list of symbols like quoted code, and instead define same by<p><pre><code>  [+ 2 /] ""avg"" def
</code></pre>
which pretty literally means, ""pop a function name off the stack, pop a block of code off the stack, and associate them in the local environment."". It no longer needs to include any state in the interpreter for whether it was in recording or executing mode, keep track of some words (e.g. "";"") which must interrupt recording mode, etc. (Adding code-as-data really adds to a language's capacity for abstraction.) Similarly, ""[+ 2 /] do"" works for an anonymous function of sorts. Much of the rest of the language is contained by how some of the core idioms for things like evaluation and definitions work, and formalisms like the lambda calculus and combinatory logic seem to be frameworks for studying those processes explicitly.<p>By the way, if you'd like to write a quick interpreter as a learning experience, Forth has my recommendation. It's small and (aggressively) simple, but still supports an impressive amount of abstraction. The parser for it is even simpler than for a Lisp, and that's really saying something. (Here is a nice example of one written in heavily documented i386 assembly: <a href=""http://www.annexia.org/_file/jonesforth.s.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.annexia.org/_file/jonesforth.s.txt</a> )<p>Second, OCaml seems to be particularly well-suited for writing interpreters (and compilers, I'm sure), though in this case it was <i>serious</i> overkill.<p>* I'm kind of whining here, but AFAICT it isn't possible to install a working version of Factor (<a href=""http://factorcode.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factorcode.org/</a>) on OpenBSD (or, probably, any Unix) without downgrading to a version of the OS using the same dynamic libraries, installing their binary version, and then progressively updating both in tandem until it's running with current libraries. Maybe I just don't have enough experience bootstrapping new language environments, but that was a disappointment -- it looks like a cool language.<p>(Also, 1 isn't really an argument so much as an observation.)",1218828518

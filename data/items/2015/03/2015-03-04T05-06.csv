From a marketing perspective, &quot;hand written&quot; letters on high quality paper sealed with wax and delivered to a customer is probably a good way to get their attention.<p>However, because of my background, I&#x27;m looking at it from the writers point of view. The almost elaborate ritual of writing a piece starting from selecting the paper, ruling it, selecting the ink, nibs, hand (that&#x27;s what we call fonts) and then getting into a semi-trance while you write it is enormously rewarding. It&#x27;s the opposite of everything tech. You have to plan out the whole piece in advance and can&#x27;t just &quot;iterate&quot;. You can&#x27;t backspace an error and often have to throw away an hour of work just because you lost concentration and wrote an &#x27;e&#x27; instead of an &#x27;a&#x27; in the last word of the piece you&#x27;re working on. It&#x27;s got a lot of room for &quot;disciplined freedom&quot;. Using a non standard letter form in a place so that the overall piece is more harmonious is very gratifying. Another interesting thing is that listening to music while writing can disturb your rhythm as your hand and pen starts to pick up the beat of the song rather than the letter forms and the piece is damanged. Several things like this come into play while doing the piece and almost therapuetic for me. I wish Bond luck with their product but it&#x27;d be a loss for people to not indulge themselves in actually writing by hand just because this (or other similar) products exist.",1425448589

I personally like the NXT algo; its basic approach in simplified form is:<p>seed(genesis) = 0<p>seed(block) = hash(seed(block.parent) + block.proposer.address)<p>No grind capabilities at all. No matter how many times you try, you will always generate the exact same result. The randomness basically comes from absentee proposers, so the only way to influence the outcome (not proposing) is costly as you sacrifice your reward and all other influence over the block beyond signing / not signing it.",1425448575

It eliminates overflow, and the need to analyze each int to see if it will overflow the type you&#x27;re sticking it into.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind being able to have a &quot;RangedInt<min, max>&quot; type either, in addition. If the bounds are tight enough, the compiler could just use the next-bigger machine integer type (and do bounds-checking, please!). I think a integral type that was always modulo the max would be useful in many applications as well (i.e., unsigned, and overflow is well-defined to wrap, but you explicitly opt-in to this behavior.) You can imagine,<p><pre><code>  int: signed, bounded only by memory
  ranged_int<min, max>: integer type capable of holding anything in [min, max].
     Over/underflow is an error (exception? panic? [1])
  modulo_int<min, max>: unsigned, overflow wraps.
     (Mathematicians probably have a better name here… &quot;ring&quot;?)
  &quot;usize&quot; or &quot;size_t&quot;: capable of holding any memory address, so useful for indexes.
  native::uint8, native::uint16, etc: whatever your hardware gives you, if you really need it.

In my opinion however, the differences in these two areas are rather marginal when it comes to how life plays out. To me it comes down to this: Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m an Alien from outer space who tries to integrate into human society. How free am I to do whatever I&#x27;d like. Let&#x27;s mount Maslow&#x27;s pyramid.<p>* changing the atmosphere with the gas I like to breath didn&#x27;t go over too well - got imprisoned for a while, will not repeat.<p>* eating a human was even worse!

Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.<p>* Alright, I&#x27;ve learned that human life is sacred and that I shouldn&#x27;t try to change the environment too much that humans like. Next I had to get was some food source. After searching through what humans throw away (tasty!), some humans came and brought me to a place with a roof. I talked to some other human with a suit who hooked me up with some idea of theirs, I think it&#x27;s called a &#x27;bank account&#x27;. I learned that I can use that to go to a &#x27;store&#x27; and exchange that thing using some electrons with fresh food. Pretty neat!<p>* Good news! That suit guy even organized a home for me! Well, the thing is, other humans there didn&#x27;t quite like my morning roaring rituals, so I had to give them up. Noise is not such a good idea here, especially when silly humans are &#x27;sleeping&#x27; - whatever that is, noone could explain so far. Some guy even called in other humans that came in a dress with the word &#x27;police&#x27; on it.

This picture:<p><a href=""http://swiftdoc.org/type/Int/hierarchy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swiftdoc.org/type/Int/hierarchy/</a><p>Tells a lot. And this is from unofficial documentation that has been generated from Swift libraries. When you read the documentation Apple provides there is little explanation of this huge protocol hierarchy and the rationale behind it.<p>It seems to me that: Swift has been released in a rush with bugs even in the core language and compiler. Lacking documentation. And of course even a larger number of bugs in the IDE support, debugging etc.<p>Secondly: Swift battles the problem of easy-to-understand typesafe generics like so many other languages only it has it much worse: It carries a lot of stuff from Objective-C and it has to support easy interoperability. Plus it has ideas like not allowing implicit conversion of number types (requiring an integer added to a double to be explicitly converted to a double) causing the big type system to show it&#x27;s messy head again and again.<p>I really want to love Swift but it will take years for Swift to be as clean and productive as Objective-C.<p>I my opinion what Apple should have done was to create the &quot;CoffeeScript&quot; of Objective-C.

We are wildly thrilled about this and hope you will be, too.<p>So you may be wondering…..<p>Why is this good for me? 
You will get an even more robust and well-supported way to give and get local recommendations. By combining our GemShare expertise with Nextdoor’s team of over 100 super-smart people, all deeply committed to building the most useful local platform ever, we are building you something amazing--and not just on iOS.<p>What should I do next? If you are not already a member of Nextdoor, we hope you will join up and give it a spin (over 35% of US neighborhoods already have!). You’ll be able to use it for everything from sharing neighborhood recommendations and events, to posting classifieds, to keeping your neighborhood safe and sound.<p>What will happen to GemShare? GemShare will continue operating for the next little while as Nextdoor works on developing its recommendations capabilities. When we feel the time is right, we will offer you the option of moving your Gems to Nextdoor so that you can continue accessing them after we transition GemShare.<p>So what are you waiting for :-)<p>Click here to check out Nextdoor<p>Thank you all for the beautiful recommendations you have shared with each other using GemShare. It has been heartwarming and delightful to hear the many stories of people finding the perfect piano teacher, handyman, tailor, and so much more.<p>If you have any questions, please drop us a line.<p>Warmly and with gratitude,
Maryam and Claudine<p>P.S.  Here see these lovely examples of how people around the country are using Nextdoor to build vibrant, helpful neighborhoods every day.<p>EDIT: not sure why this was downvoted. The article refers to NextDoor&#x27;s strategy being to build a local trusted recommendation system, and they just bought GemShare (a trusted recommendation system) to help with this.",1425445388

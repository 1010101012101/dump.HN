764154,comment,763850,764001,0,0,wcarss,,,"I think that any programmer worth their weight must disagree with the larger message you're giving here.<p>C does _not_ suck at networking, concurrency, security, or readability.<p>Most code you write in a 'modern language' like Java, Python, or something similar, is implemented on a very low level in C. So those nice, clean, safe networking functions Python pulls out of nowhere are just well written C code being presented to the user through layers of abstractions. The same goes with modern type-safety and security (that 'proofed' kernel from a few days ago was Haskell mapped into C).<p>From a readability standpoint, C represents a tradeoff. The core C API can be kept in its entirety in a programmer's mind. Starting from scratch, you are able to know (essentially) every language feature C has, how to use it, and what side-effects it could cause. Compare this to Java, Python, or even C++, and you get into a scary world that's just too big to keep in mental RAM all at once - but a lot closer to english and more compact.<p>There was an article which came out a few days ago talking about how C has been and will continue to be the top choice for software over C++ _and_ assembly in embedded projects over the past 12-15 years. Given that embedded systems make up something like 98% of the computer market and the number of computers grow with each passing year, the argument should flow the opposite way:<p>Every year that goes by, C becomes more useful.<p>In addition, it's an ideal language for teaching the notion of pointers, the reasons for security, the value of good program structure, and yes, it's difficult. If you teach people to be comfortable dealing with C, they'll feel like Python is pie. (or.. py :P)<p>All that said, I cannot disagree with the value of functional, object oriented, or other paradigms being taught to students. Many people do not really learn to deal with recursion until they've learned a dialect of Lisp. Many people do not really learn the power of design patterns and the object model until they've written something in a high level language that uses it (take your pick).<p>The fact that these are good things to be exposed to and to use does not in any way diminish the importance or usefulness of C for both career programmers or computer scientists.<p>tl;dr: ""C is still good too homg""",1250296409

764152,comment,763850,764001,0,0,halo,,,"I believe the choice of C isn't really about ""how computers work"" as much as ""how algorithms work"", with C only providing a minimal toolkit of architecture-independent efficient high-level functions that allow for a simple mental model of how algorithms in higher-level languages work underneath, which is extremely useful in the real-world for getting a good overview of algorithm efficiency.<p>Another good reason is that C is useful as a sort of mid-level psuedocode. This pseudocode is useful for providing a mental model that allows you to make the leap from a modern high-level language to C to an assembly language much more easily than making the straight cognitive leap from a high-level language to the specifics of an assembly language or architecture.",1250296166

After some discount I had, it was about $145 for 14 months prepaid -- including phone, minutes, and double minutes for life.  As long as I don't go over about an hour of calls a month (and so far I'm doing even less than that), it will work out to just over $10/mo for the first 14 months.  My landline was around $50/mo.  I kept the landline as long as I did in part for a reason I don't seem to see mentioned here:  If there is a natural disaster and power is out and you need to call emergency services, you can pick up your landline and it will work.  Of course, this assumes you have an old fashioned phone hooked up to your landline and not one of those newfangled wireless phones.  Those require electricity to work.<p>The next time I buy minutes for my Tracfone, I plan to get another $100 card good for another year.

280261,comment,275328,278343,0,0,apgwoz,,,"> and you decline to use them because they're in a ubiquitous proprietary format, you are maybe missing the free-software forest for the trees.<p>I didn't decline to use them. I suggested that it would be nice if these documents were in a format that was more open. Perhaps something with a half-life of 10 years.<p>I didn't mention it before, but I've noticed that in Office for Mac 2008(7? whatever) the default file format is .docx. OOXML to my knowledge is now a standard, so it seems as though Microsoft is _trying_ to play nice with others. However, there's already another standard, OpenDocument.",1219143472

Especially if there's a chance of locking users in to a device with DRM. And it seems impossible that there won't be a change. The whole economics of printing is built on the realities of.. printing. How long can they keep pretending that books are being printed?<p>But I guess you're right. It's not 'no sense' it's 'no cojones'.",1219143026

It also helps to keep in mind that ANSI Common Lisp is not really about ANSI Common Lisp, but an ideal Lisp that doesn't exist. To actually learn Common Lisp (which I can heartily recommend), try Paradigms of AI Programming (despite the title, it's not especially an AI book) or Practical Common Lisp. CLOS is also well-covered by Sonya Keene's CLOS book.",1219142181

280252,comment,279865,279982,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Actually, it makes tons of sense.<p>Amazon is the king of online book sales. They're connected to the world's publishers and authors and they're really enjoying their position above everyone else.<p>If the way we view eBooks were to change, if eBook prices were to reflect their true costs, the entire online book industry would be shaken.... it most likely will happen, sooner or later, but Amazon (smartly) doesn't want to be the one to instigate such an upheaval that would leave them in a risky situation.<p>It's very likely that should such an event occur, they would adapt and remain the kings of online media sales - but it's a risk that they don't <i>have</i> to take - they're already at the top so it's nothing to gain and everything to lose.<p>They're trying to shape the emerging market by their own hands in their own way, a step at a time, to ensure that they'll always be safe.",1219141964

I know you have a paragraph of text on the slave page but I think that needs to be the first thing you see.  It's a feature which distinguishes you from many other services.  Shout about it.<p>- Your guidelines state that a good password will, ""Be seven or fourteen characters long, due to the way in which encryption works. For obvious reasons, fourteen characters are preferable.""  The default on the form is 8 characters.  Try to be internally consistent.  My knowledge of encryption is fairly weak, why is 7 or 14 characters best?<p>- Your privacy statement says, ""API page only permitted SSL(https) requests.""  I seem able to access the page using plain http.<p>- What is the significance of ""You generate password 50 times in the an hour. Because, we check SPAM requests.""  The way I'm reading it you only generate 50 sets of password each hour and if more than 50 people come to your site you just serve the same set of passwords again.  I doubt this is correct but that's the way I read it.",1219141085

569443,comment,569103,569103,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"- LED and OLED lighting. When prices fall enough, classic bulbs, fluorescent bulbs, CFLs will be out the window. Lighting, and therefore atmosphere, will completely change. Can you imagine an office without strip lighting? With varying warm, friendly colours and intensities of low power OLED panels dotted around? Computer controlled lighting <i>features</i> will become common because they will be cheap and easy. Homes without a kilowatt of halogen uplighters?<p>- The next iPhone. Even after owning one for a year, which was a year old when I got it so it was being designed three years ago or more, I still turn it over and marvel at it, at what it does, how well it does it and how good it looks and feels while doing so. It's the biggest consumer success of HCI in a long time, and that's really pleasing. They're addressing the lag when opening the SMS app, adding MMS, adding better bluetooth support, an autofocus camera, enabling and encouraging an accessory market, and twisting the arms of the mobile carriers like other handset makers haven't been. It's exciting.<p>- Small, LED driven, no-moving-part ""pocket"" projectors. See: Microsoft surface and Epson's coffee table and similar. One day they wont be driven by a big expensive noisy projector hidden a few feet beneath or behind. It need not be a massive screen itself, but an improvement of today's pocket projectors - when they can do 1280x1024 at better brightness, look out basic office CRTs and LCDs.",1240152915

For ""Apple's business model"", substitute ""Apple's business model, which involves not caring much about the low-margin, high-grief corporate IT hardware business."" And, for ""contempt for its users"", substitute ""contempt for the people running corporate IT departments"". (Remember, IT doesn't care about the people who <i>type</i> on the computers. It's the people who <i>set up</i> the computers who are the primary ""users"".)<p>I'm sure it really does suck to try and maintain Macs in a Windows-centric corporate environment. But it's not as if corporate IT has anyone but themselves to blame. They turned away from Apple in the <i>early 1980s</i> and have never really looked back until now. Apple has learned to survive without their business and now has no real incentive to become the next Microsoft. Somebody else needs to step up and do that.",1240152107

Driving is fun, for a start!<p><i>human errors make up 93% of the causes of car accidents</i><p>What kind of human errors? Running out into the road in front of cars? Driving while too tired? Arguments with passengers? Not looking when changing lanes? Too busy looking for road signs to see a stopped car ahead? Driving horribly to try and go back for a missed turn?<p>Technology could help with a lot of these problems without replacing cars altogether. Current Volvos can have a blind-spot warning system, they can ready the brakes for you as you get close to a car in front so they will react quicker, they can silence incoming phone calls when the car detects too much activity (e.g. sharp cornering) so it wont distract you.<p>I look forward to the day when all road signs are gone and replaced with informational broadcasts that my car will interpret, and on the dashboard I get a neat summary of the current speed limit, the GPS navigation route to where I'm going, and that's about it.<p>You also aren't clear which figures you mention are worldwide and which are USA only.

You also need to develop self confidence in your own independent decision making ability<p>#2 - is that, just because someone has ""been there, done that, been successful"" doesn't mean that their advice/approach will work for you.

All numbers in JS are 64 bit floating point numbers. This allows for a crazy amount of NaNs (and oh the fun stuff you can do with that). To be sane, NaNs are not the same when comparing them (there is a lot more subtlety in that - comparing quiet and signalling NaNs, and so on and so forth)",1395323990

See the recent thread on the glibc mailing list: <a href=""https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2014-03/msg00408.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2014-03/msg00408.html</a> and the bug tracker issue linked.<p>At this point both musl and glibc only cover a very small portion of C11 additions. glibc has a GSoC project proposal (with 3+ students interested in it) to add C11 threads, which is one of the big missing areas. We&#x27;ve been holding off on doing so in musl in an interest of making sure we do it in a way that&#x27;s ABI-compatible with glibc, so we&#x27;ll probably add C11 threads in the near future too.",1395323937

In one case you have a high priced escort who takes on a select few clients and earns like a star stockbroker.

7435481,comment,7435011,7435234,12,0,knome,,,"It looks like clang creates it&#x27;s data structure representing the template instantiation, caches the instantiation for the parameterizing types, then begins instantiating the types for the members. When it first hits the static bool, it reserves space for it&#x27;s static value, then recurses into the static bools type in order to determine the value. Since the recursion uses the same parameterizing types, it finds the type it was midway through constructing, finds the space-reserved-but-no-appropriate-value-set static member in it, takes a 0 from that memory ( presumably from having allocated and zeroed the memory when initially saving space for the final value ).<p>For the MutualRec it may not set the static const value as being derived from a constexpr until after having retrieved the value, causing it to access the member in the cache before it&#x27;s constexpr&#x27;ness has been determined.<p>For the Contra example, it would return 1 from having not&#x27;ed the 0 it found in the uninitialized static const.<p>Russel&#x27;s paradox would be subverted in the same manner as the Contra example, returning true because it found false ( 0 ) in an uninitialized member variable after looking up the partially instatiated template instantiation in a cache.<p>This is all conjecture, but it fits, and it&#x27;s where I would look first if debugging this. I do not know whether this is allowed by the standard, but I&#x27;d wager they did not account for referring cyclically to partially instantiated template parameterizations in a cache.

The best first step into SOA to take is offloading work that doesn&#x27;t need a user response to a pool of workers (often by publishing to a message bus, as mentioned elsewhere in the thread). I&#x27;ve implemented systems like that using Rabbit and Redis and it worked fairly well.<p>However, some kinds of requests are fundamentally about integrating the results of a bunch of different services into a response to send to the user. In that case you somehow need to gather the results of your rpcs/events in one place to integrate them.  An example is Google search where the normal results, ads, and various specialized results/knowledge graph data need to be integrated to present to the user.<p>Another consideration is how much you want to be able to isolate services. If you have a user/auth service as in the article which completely encapsulates the database and other resources needed for data about users then you&#x27;ll end up with a lot of calls into that service.

While the blogger took pains to protect his identity – he claimed falsely to be in Quebec and used an assumed name online – a Microsoft team dubbed Trustworthy Computing Investigations attempted to track the blogger down.<p>While searching the blogger’s account, Microsoft investigators found an email from Kibkalo in which he shared Windows 8 “hot fixes” through an online hosting system, the FBI agent continued. Windows 8 had not been released to the public at the time, and was the subject of much speculation in the industry.<p>Investigators claim to have recovered instant messages Kibkalo exchanged with the blogger showing Kibkalo was sharing trade secrets illegally.<p>“I would leak enterprise today probably,” Kibkalo told the blogger during an Aug. 2, 2012 exchange, according to charging papers.<p>“Hmm,” the blogger replied. “Are you sure you want to do that?

In my experience everytime it has seemed like the interface was too complex too support services correctly, it&#x27;s been because the break for the services was at the wrong level of abstraction. SOA tends to work best when you define discreet chunks of functionality and each service is only responsible for that chunk. Just like developing testable code, you want to make those chunks as small as possible, without losing your mind at the shear number of services. For example having an order service and shipping service as opposed to a just an order service that handles everything is more likely to make sense IMO.",1395320651

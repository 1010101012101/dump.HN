2020733,comment,2020378,2020632,0,0,Groxx,,,"I still don't see how this is 2D or 3D.  They are very very strictly related, both visually upon dragging and technically as they simply send back their values (which is exactly 1D of data).  Visually/semantically, I'd argue this falls somewhere between 1 and 2 dimensions; they're so tightly bound, they <i>are</i> a single thing, you're just dividing it up.  (Visually, a linear relationship is probably better signalled by manipulating a pie chart than a bunch of sliders.)<p>From a programming standpoint, all these are indistinguishable from numeric fields.  If they are related, they belong in a fieldset, and/or probably have a naming scheme implemented in their IDs (slider_a_1, slider_a_2, etc).  Screen readers will have to be hinted anyway, probably by a chunk of text before it, ie: for blind users.  And there again we fall upon problems with non-linear relationships between the sliders causing trouble if it's all in HTML.<p>The reason I argue for behavior is because HTML <i>is</i> structure.  CSS is its display, and JS is its behavior.  That's its <i>purpose</i>; any holdovers (<font>) are just that - holdovers from before a better system-wide structure was enforced.  Thus, as this is merely a <i>behavior</i> of a set of sliders, it belongs in the JS layer.<p>Scrapers are doomed to have trouble with behavior anyway, as HTML has no ability to define that clicking checkbox_1 causes textbox_5 to be prefixed by ""squish "".  And it shouldn't.  That's why we have JS.",1292720330

2020729,comment,2020594,2020594,0,0,mquander,,,"I don't understand their reconciliation of this case with the printer toner case in regards to Warden ""effectively controlling access"" to WoW's dynamic elements.  From the decision:<p><i>...In Lexmark, the plaintiff sold laser printers equipped with an authentication sequence, verified by the printer’s copyrighted software, that ensured that only plaintiff’s own toner cartridges could be inserted into the printers. The defendant sold microchips capable of generating an authentication sequence that rendered other manufacturers’ cartridges compatible with plaintiff’s printers.<p>...The mere purchase of one of plaintiff’s printers allowed “access” to the copyrighted program. Any purchaser could read the program code directly from the printer memory without encountering the authentication sequence. The authentication sequence thus blocked only one form of access: the ability to make use of the printer. However, it left intact another form of access: the review and use of the computer program’s literal code...it seems clear that this provision does not naturally extend to a technological measure that restricts one form of access but leaves another route wide open.</i><p>By the same token, wouldn't you say that Warden blocks only one form of access to WoW's copyrighted dynamic elements -- the ability to access the game when running a bot -- and leaves intact another form of access -- the ability to access the game normally when no other programs are running?  Can someone who understands the fine print here help explain the distinction?",1292720246

I cannot quote any specific source, but as long as I've been around, you're only supposed to downvote comments that add nothing to the discussion.  Now sometimes this is a gray area, as you are biased.  I don't think this is something we can fix, you just kind to have to deal with it.  That said, if someone types up a thoughtful comment, and you disagree with it, you should probably actually upvote it rather than downvoting it, since it adds to the discussion.  If you haven't figured it out by now, disagreement is good for a community, because it causes people to think about what they believe.

I think he worked for someone else for a time and/or worked from home and decided to open a shop.  Once he opened a shop, then my mom, who sews, got involved as well and it became a place where they also sold patterns and material and sewing supplies.  I don't think they ever did very well and I think they really couldn't get on the same page. There also weren't the resources there are today for assisting small businesses. The store eventually folded. My mom brought home leftover material, thread, patterns, etc and stocked her sewing room with them and spent years using up some of that stuff.<p>My mom also took in sewing at home for years and years and later became self-employed as a cleaning lady.  Her skills were in high enough demand that when my dad went through chemo about 16 years ago and she had to mostly be home to care for him, she could make one phone call and have work on her terms for the hour or two she had available on some afternoon when he was doing well enough to be left alone briefly.

We had a rule that said ""A good compiler generates assembly code that an assembly programmer would be fired for writing.""  Early releases of that compiler would get bug reports from the OS implementation team that ""this code is wrong"".  We would sit down and walk through the generated code, and there would be an ""Oh"" moment where the programmer would realize that it was simply different, and in all cases, faster.<p>Similarly, the code generated by good Python, to a CPU, looks like crap because it repeats stuff, allocates and releases memory, makes unnecessary calls, swaps stuff between stack and registers, and a whole host of other sins.<p>But we don't care, because what we care about is the end result:  the Python or Lua or Ruby code generates lovely computational results.  Perhaps 1% of spend time looking in detail at the actual machine code generated.  The purpose of these languages is to 1) Let us write good, readable code and 2) generate a useful, sometimes beautiful result.<p>Similarly, the purpose of this particular Arc program is to generate a useful result, that is, a readable, useful set of html files that our browsers render readably.<p>So really, ""it doesn't matter"" if the assembly language is junk, or if the html is not something early versions of Patrick would turn out with notepad.<p>Think of the generated html as assembly language.

When Android first came out, it's ""native"" applications were all apps that were written more or less from scratch using the Android APIs. When Android first came out, there were essentially zero apps. ""Native"" usually isn't raw ARM binaries either, it's in the form of dalvik vm bytecode, optimized not for speed, but for executable size. The only time native is useful is with truly performance critical applications, and the vast majority of apps aren't performance critical. Javascript runtimes are getting faster with each release and the huge amount of competition between browser vendors. Chrome also has Native Client, which would be the equivalent of Android's NDK.<p>If by ""native"" you mean the user interface consistency, acknowledging that web apps will be significant pretty much destroys that anyway. Lots of iOS/Android apps don't even use the native UI widgets anyway, so it's not a really worthy goal.<p>Android started with a huge disadvantage: not having any apps. Yet only a few years later, the platform hundreds of thousands. Chrome and the web as a platform is much more approachable, and for every existing android or iOS app, in a short time, there will be rough equivalents that can be made.<p>From the start, Chrome has millions.

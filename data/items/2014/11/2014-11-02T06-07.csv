Technically it&#x27;s sound specifications wise that indicates it shouldn&#x27;t have major problems with gaming with the exception of the Intel Iris Pro GPU which in many demos has show to be a pretty capable graphics processor. Yet there are details of the GPU that simply don&#x27;t make sense for example how can it score so low on general firestrike benchmarks yet run League of Legends and Assassin&#x27;s creed at 90FPS. It&#x27;s even been tested playing WoW at 120 FPS in some instances yet a game that wouldn&#x27;t at first guess be so demanding like Diablo 3 runs at a unexplainable low 20FPS, what makes that specific game so different? My guess is Particle or general physics which the GPU doesn&#x27;t handle well however Starcraft 2 seems to run just fine which in my option should be the same as Diablo 3. Also most games are designed to default to CPU processing if bullet or PhysX options are not available. Maybe someone else can unravel this mystery.",1414910751

There are several solutions in the space of this.<p>A simple solution would be to split or abstract the logic with handling the data versus the functionality of the mobile app itself. In which case you should not be tied down to specific backends.<p>Anything that works for mongodb or other databases you can usually find something that converts said backend to something working for postgres or whatever for server side.<p>As for mobile your data backend should be something lightweight and it may be beneficial to use something that is agnostic to mobile like html5. Key players for web data usually are Indexedb and somewhat basket.js : <a href=""https://addyosmani.github.io/basket.js/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addyosmani.github.io/basket.js/</a> .

8545894,comment,8544788,8545788,0,0,droithomme,,,"Excellent take down. I&#x27;d also like to add that Mr. Selingo&#x27;s paragraph here is so disingenuous that it can not be considered anything but a blatant lie:<p>> A second problem is that when MOOCs replace traditional courses, an extremely high number of students fail. A well-publicized experiment backed by Gov. Jerry Brown of California at San Jose State University flopped. In one of the MOOCs, just 25 percent of students passed; in another, only 50 percent passed, much lower rates than for the on-campus equivalents.<p>The experiment in question involved a remedial algebra class offered to students at SJSU who had not only failed &quot;elementary math placement tests&quot;, but who had previously paid for and taken a on campus &quot;SJSU Plus math&quot; course and failed it. These were not normal students, these were from among the 50% of entering high school graduate students who were incapable of meeting basic requirements. They paid $150 to take the remedial class, much less than normal tuition at SJSU. When you fail the remedial class at SJSU, you are kicked out of the university and made to go back to community college and reapply to SJSU later. These students were given a chance at a second chance - to try their hand at an online class.<p>The results[1] were that the SJSU on campus college algebra class has a 64.7% pass rate. The Summer 2013 pilot of the on line version had a 72.6% pass rate. That is a higher rate. For the remedial math class called Entry Level Math, the on campus pass rate has been 45.5%. For the on line summer 2013 pilot the pass rate was 29.8%. That is lower. However, in this case these students had already failed the on-campus one and were selected from that population. They were not the general population of students. The class was not replacing an on campus class since these students did not have the option of taking remedial class a second time, their only option was to leave the university and go to community college.<p>When offering the same class to the general population of students, and not students that have failed remedial classes already, results are always better. The numbers for college algebra are above and represent a tremendous tuition savings. For SJSU&#x27;s Circuits and Electronics class, 40% of on campus students got C or lower. For the online version of the same class, offered for SJSU credit through the EdX platform, only 9% got a C or lower. [2]<p>In reporting these results, Mr. Selingo states that &quot;when MOOCs replace traditional courses, an extremely high number of students fail&quot;. This claim is false.<p>1. <a href=""http://blogs.sjsu.edu/today/2013/sjsu-plus-fall-2013-update-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.sjsu.edu/today/2013/sjsu-plus-fall-2013-update-...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/technology/california-to-give-web-courses-a-big-trial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/technology/california-to-g...</a>",1414910618

As a pretty much exclusively .net/visual studio dev, the experience for development, while the machine is powerful enough to handle it, is utterly abysmal.  Visual Studio and SQL server (which uses the VS shell) does not support touch screens in any sensible or usable way.  I&#x27;m not asking for gesture rich smart windows here, just being able to scroll a text editor with one finger.  Every other MS app on there seems ok, just not the VS based ones.  Nothing but text selecting when you&#x27;re expecting to scroll.  The physical keyboard is too flexible and cramped to use on your lap - despite all the marketing videos claims, and probably my single biggest annoyance is that when that physical typecover is installed, it still pops up the soft keyboard every time you touch a textbox, anywhere.  That, and if your soft keyboard isn&#x27;t set up right, many times it will take maximized or docked left/right windows and resize them, only to leave them resized once the keyboard goes away again.<p>So while I love to hear people say it&#x27;s good for &quot;creating content&quot;, as long as that content is a drawing, that might be true, but if that &quot;content&quot; is any kind of written work, spreadsheet, or coding task, it&#x27;s almost useless.<p>Also, the version of OneNote that comes with it is so handicapped that it also borders on useless.

Even if you work longer, you will not necessarily accumulate significantly (or perhaps even any) more wealth.  And if you are in poverty currently (ie, effectively earning nothing), multiplying that by another 300 years still leaves you with zero.<p>2. If there <i>is</i> any change to the accumulation patterns of money, I would suspect that either the rich would get (individually) richer -- or perhaps more money would be printed, thus de-valuing the existing money.<p>3. Being at the median global living standard does not guarantee that you will produce fewer children.  For example, there are many people in Western countries who for religious reasons continue to produce large families.  More time for them would presumably result in even larger families.<p>4.

Obviously, education takes a backseat and somehow student graduates with huge debt.

Ideally I&#x27;d like to stick to it, especially Postgres, as we&#x27;re dealing with financial transactions. We already have HTTP/JSON APIs to read/write data. We can also develop fine-grained APIs using Thrift, if required.<p>Now, my question is, is there a project/service/SDK out there which has already solved this data sync problem? What about conflict resolution when it comes to transaction data? I understand that this is like resolving merge conflicts in git, which basically requires human intervention, but is there an SDK that will reduce dev time for such scenarios? Can said SDK work with a custom backend API?",1414908365

I think it is reasonable to e.g. force companies to put &quot;Not FDA approved&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to preclude sale at all.<p>There are a number of medical treatments that have been proven safe to EMA (the European version of the FDA) standards, but were either mired for further years in the FDA approval process or were never approved at all due to the increased complexity and cost of the FDA approval process. Take a look at <a href=""http://www.bioworld.com/content/ema-trounces-fda-2013-drug-approval-tally-81-vs-27"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bioworld.com/content/ema-trounces-fda-2013-drug-a...</a> to see the disparity.<p>The argument I always hear against allowing people to purchase  drugs that haven&#x27;t been officially approved by whatever agency has jurisdiction over the patient is &quot;But what if some unscrupulous drug salesman bamboozles them into buying snake oil?&quot;. It seems to me that the existence of the FDA, EMA, and any number of other national and private certifying bodies is more than sufficient to allow people to make an informed decision for themselves.<p>I think that any argument for drug decriminalization or bodily sanctity can be applied in favor of allowing people to choose what drugs they wish to consume (even though some people <i>will</i> make unwise choices).",1414908340

When I asked for more, the indian-born Indian CEO of the company went apeshit on me.<p>No real story only that almost everyone is scum. It&#x27;s not just the companies. When I told the director of my org what I was getting paid she hired me full time right away at a competitive salary. And I was just lucky that she happened to like me. Other people who complained simply got let go.<p>I sense there is something else at play here
 IT work isn&#x27;t that hard, yet for some reason instead of increasing awareness that there is huge demand for these jobs, we fly people in from india. We pay 150 bucks an hour for them, when an eager college kid can do and would do the same job with a bit of training for a fraction of the cost. Something else is going on here.",1414908334

Employers use visas as a club against local talent, so you go without equity, work 3 times as many hours as you&#x27;re paid for and when the company is sold you&#x27;re out of a job. Not to mention taking &quot;hair cuts&quot; so you work without pay and do without basic necessities to make someone else rich, this shit has ruined my life being a coder in Los Angeles, yes I survive but I can&#x27;t even afford a computer for myself, the employers game the system until you have to go without food to make someone else rich, forget about the dream of being able to own your own computer.",1414908318

If everyone on earth started living to 400, the world&#x27;s population would rapidly shrink.<p>If you brought the bottom ~2 billion up to the median global living standard, the total human population would begin to contract due to the reduction in new births brought on by the higher standard of living. If you reach an income level on par with poor Eastern European nations ($10k to $15k), you start to see a decline or flattening in population.<p>With accidental deaths, and the huge drop in new births, it wouldn&#x27;t take very long - relative to the new life expectancies - to cut the population of the planet in half.<p>If all people stopped dying at 65, and say lived to 400, the wealth accumulation would be substantial for most of the poorest (which currently reside in China and India). Their standard of living would skyrocket, as they&#x27;d have perhaps 300 good working years. Those 1.5+ billion poor living in China and India would also likely live long enough to see the conditions of the poor in said countries improve immensely. Not to mention the remarkable breakthroughs in technology / medicine that would occur during their lifetimes, a further multiplier lifting them up out of current levels of poverty.",1414908296

Compared to modern IDEs like VisualStudio or IntelliJ products, however - not so much.<p>vi users tout the rapid text editing features, but you can generate and navigate code just as fast with an IDE - out of the box - no configuration incantations or third party packages required.<p>Until very recently (early to mid-2000s), IDEs for open source web frameworks were non-existent, unaffordable, or slow. Once you have a working vi or emacs setup, there&#x27;s a lot of inertia in place that discourages switching.<p>That explains the continued popularity of vi, imo.",1414908237

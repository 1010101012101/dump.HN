I imagine with a few years&#x27; of experience at startups, you&#x27;ve learned a lot at a &quot;design&quot; level rather than simply an implementation level (not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that).<p>Consider interviewing for a developer management position.  Instead of focusing on specific languages & technologies, maybe take a step back and figure out how to apply other things you&#x27;ve learned:  how to direct a project, how to take higher-level ideas and turn them into realities.  Those types of jobs tend to be more marketable than &quot;I use X, Y, Z technologies&quot;.<p>If not management, I&#x27;d still say try to get a little more &quot;meta&quot; than just &quot;I know Rails, Node...&quot;  Market yourself at a business-level, if that makes sense.

Get some basics down on the endgame, some strategy concepts, but just the very basics, and then just study tactics. And by that I mean do tactical exercises. Most of your games, as in 98% of them, will be lost/won due to tactical errors and blunders (a blunder is just a really, really bad tactical error). If you keep to tactics you&#x27;ll get pretty good over time. When you reach, say 1800, you can start getting to grips with some deeper strategical ideas, study more openings, etc.<p>Oh, and since you asked about books, here are two books that came to mind and are pretty good (and you can go through them in this order):\nWinning Chess Tactics by Seirawan\nWinning Chess Tactics for Juniors by Lou Hays<p>Oh, and don&#x27;t mind the &#x27;Winning&#x27; in both titles.

You can&#x27;t just order a circuit from AT&T/Verizon/Sprint and inject whatever you want.  First you have to have an AS assigned to you (if you&#x27;re to have the ability to announce anyway) and then beyond that it&#x27;s generally a process of negotiating sane terms of what you&#x27;re presenting to them and what they&#x27;re presenting to you (generally as the customer you want the entire table, but there are exceptions).  At that point the config on the far end will mimic what was agreed upon (prefixes advertised and general length protections such that you don&#x27;t spam out thousands of /30s from your transport or something horrid like that).  While there is no way to truly validate the authenticity of the update - there is generally a decent chain of custody.<p>BGP is a great playground for injection research.  The best part is via looking glass sites it&#x27;s very trivial to target specific, and core, platforms.<p>That being said...  Regardless of BGP itself beyond certificate validation and pinning we should also be doing path checking.  I mentioned this to Moxie for a potential addition into Convergence, and from the page:<p>&quot;Convergence trust notaries use network perspective to validate your communication by default, but can be extended to use whatever methods the notary operator would like. This might include DNSSEC, BGP data, &quot;SSL observatory&quot; results, or even CA validation.&quot;<p>...AS path should be looked at more closely in all secure communications we&#x27;re delivering.  It&#x27;s trivial to get the AS path for the hops and, since it is generally static from known origination networks it would be relatively easy to build history of known AS path order and vet with regionalized crowd-sourcing.<p>Huge path swings should be obvious, today they&#x27;re not to most.  Some good resources are:\n* Team Cymru - <a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.org/Monitoring/BGP/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.team-cymru.org/Monitoring/BGP/</a>\n* Colorado State BGPmon - <a href=\"http://bgpmon.netsec.colostate.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bgpmon.netsec.colostate.edu/</a>\n* Cyclops (UCLA) - <a href=\"http://cyclops.cs.ucla.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cyclops.cs.ucla.edu</a><p>...and there&#x27;s also BGPMon (the service), but it has turned into a more paid for service (although you can monitor 5 x AS for free).\n* BGPmon - <a href=\"http://www.bgpmon.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bgpmon.net/</a>",1385052202

To make the same money from a dollar game you need to sell 50x as many copies basically. As an indie dev with minimal budget, making money in a market where significant revenue means significant volume, it is going to take a lot of advertising to make a dent.<p>What the bigger companies have done is made games that are F2P with a much higher value via micro transactions. Their revenue per install might be something like $10 whereas the indie dev who doesn&#x27;t want to charge as much revenue per install might be closer to $5. That means the people with the higher RPI can advertise more or spend more per install and still be profitable.<p>It&#x27;s not unfair to indies so much as it is that indies aren&#x27;t charging enough to make the numbers work. Also, if indies don&#x27;t have the cash flow to float that $5 per user over 12 months that it takes to get it, they aren&#x27;t going to be able to afford the $2.50 CPI.<p>The same economics play out in many, many businesses.

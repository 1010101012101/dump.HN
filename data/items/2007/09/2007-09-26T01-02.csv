Especially in web development, you can get these huge honking Javascript libraries that do maybe 1 thing you need. Just build it already.<p>
On the other hand, once you start writing a _system_ to do something, like tag clouds or rounded corners or something like that, use some common sense and at least take a look at what's out there. Sometimes you can pick up some lightweight stuff that can save you a bunch of time.<p>
What's the saying? Good authors borrow from others. Great authors steal. ",1190769922

59657,comment,59473,59618,0,0,nailer,,,"I think you've been modded down as noting the differences between races is seen to be discriminating against them in the US.<p>There could be a number of factors that determine the difference between university entrance scores for different racial groups. While those places are free, lower caste groups may be too worried about feeding themselves, or trying to protect themselves in rough environments, to worry about studying. They could also be, in general, less genetically gifted. <p>Though unpopular, it is no more racist to state the second options than it is to analyse the difference between African and European performance in athletic  sports. People once though that a more athletic society was responsible for the generally better performance of Africans. these days most sports physiologists will acknowledge that African people have a genetically higher percentage of 'fast twitch' muscles.<p>Just because something is unpalatable does not mean it shouldn't be discussed.",1190769055

Value can be created through innovation that results in job destruction. Furthermore, a product or service that eliminates one job can easily be responsible for creating one or more new jobs.<p>The author&#x27;s Salesforce example is particularly naive. While it would probably be inaccurate to claim that Salesforce alone slayed Siebel[1], the reality is that Salesforce did upend the CRM market. In doing so, Salesforce created significant value, but at the expense of established CRM software providers and many of the integrators that relied on the demand for their products.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fortune.com/2014/01/23/lessons-from-the-death-of-a-tech-goliath/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortune.com/2014/01/23/lessons-from-the-death-of-a-te...</a>",1407214698

If there aren&#x27;t any -- if they&#x27;re a toy, a novelty -- it seems completely fair to hold them to a higher standard.<p>By the same token, we could argue that movies should be banned because the images can trigger PTSD and epileptic seizures, and movies have no practical, non-entertainment benefits.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to say that a product should be re-designed to provide the same utility in a safer manner if that&#x27;s an option. But it is not the government&#x27;s place to make wholesale subjective decisions about utility to begin with. That is, it&#x27;s one thing to require that Ford fix the design flaw in the Pinto that made it conducive to explosions because no one really wants an exploding car.

Another major factor is that many of the most expensive commercial payloads (such as major geosynchronous comsats) need to end up in equatorial orbits. The latitude of the launch site is also the minimum inclination of the initial orbit the launch vehicle can provide. At the equator you can launch into any orbital inclination. At the North Pole you can only launch into polar orbits. At 45 deg. latitude you can only launch into orbital inclinations of 45 to 90 deg. The higher the initial orbital inclination the more work you&#x27;ll have to do (the more delta V you&#x27;ll have to apply) in a plane change burn in order to get into an equatorial orbit.",1407214402

Your key point that one needs to know SQL in order to use an ORM is absolutely true.  However, the value of the ORM is not that it hides awareness of relational databases and SQL; it is in that of <i>automating</i> the task of generating database-specific SQL as well as that of mapping SQL statement execution and result sets, specific to the database driver in use, to object-oriented application state, and keeping these two states in sync without the need for explicit and inconsistent boilerplate throughout the application.   I discuss this in many of my talks (see <a href=""http://www.sqlalchemy.org/library.html#talks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlalchemy.org/library.html#talks</a>).<p>If you worked in soda bottling company, you probably still know how to fill a bottle of soda by hand.  It&#x27;s the complex machinery that does this automatically which allows this task to scale upwards dramatically.   Configuring and using this machinery wouldn&#x27;t make much sense if you didn&#x27;t understand its fundamental task of putting soda in bottles, however.    The situation is similar when using an ORM to automate the task of generating SQL and mapping in-application data to the rows it represents.   Removing the need for &quot;knowledge&quot; has nothing to do with it.  The goal instead is to automate work that is tedious and repetitive on a manual scale.",1407212881

But it&#x27;s definitely not about neglect, at least not for most of the topics listed in the article.<p>For example, the recent AAAI 2014 conference had a bunch of papers on online algorithms for various problems. [1] Likewise, COLT had five or so papers on online learning. [2] Same with KDD [3], SODA [4], and the many other conferences this year that accept papers about ML.<p>And learning in the presence of noise? Unsupervised learning? Feature engineering? I am literally doing multiple research projects in all of these areas right now! The only way I can imagine that you think they&#x27;re neglected is that you just don&#x27;t know where to look for them, because these topics are all over the place in my world. For example, one common term for &quot;feature engineering&quot; is &quot;representation learning,&quot; and this was a big topic at this year&#x27;s SDM conference, specifically w.r.t. data mining in networks.<p>Why can&#x27;t you find a book you like for topic X?

At a previous company I built a solution (was forced into java but ultimately the same process...) that  used many of these techniques.  Some suggested next steps/additional enhancements if you need to do this repeatedly and at scale.<p>Implement global throttling on a per domain basis.<p>Consider some abstraction.  I implemented an abstract fetcher (with a number of concrete fetchers that were runtime selectable), and an abstract/concrete parser.  Compose a Scraper with these two things.  Allow for a runtime switch that will determine which fetcher to use (javascript enabled, straight requests, etc.).  If you want to get really fancy, in your database of urls, you can flag urls that need to use a heavier, full fledged browser.<p>For the fetcher, use the selenium bindings.  We tested phantomjs and chrome and chrome outperformed phantom. It might have been the java bindings (ghostdriver) but w/e, something you just have to test for yourself.  Once we settled on chrome, I built a chrome plugin to block ads and other unrelated calls.  This adds LOADs of time.  Its pretty tricky but you can inject in a list of well crafted regexes and it drops initial load times dramatically.<p>For the parser, you may want to consider a fallback system.  Often times the particular piece of data you want (say a title) can be found in a handful of places on the page.  It will make your parsing much more reliable.<p>Compose a &#x27;bot runner&#x27; from the Scraper.  We had json documents that described fields we were abstracting and all the fallback rules used to locate the needed data.  Lastly, the bot runner can be expanding to include things like navigation and other fancier tricks.<p>If you go for broke, build a system for generating bots, think chrome plugin.<p>Don&#x27;t forget, pruning dead URLs is a tricky little problem but an important one.<p>To scale this whole operation linearly, we used a queue (redis at first, eventually kafka) and storm.  Storm allowed us to arbitrary expand and contract our bot runners.<p>Scraping is a problem that just about everyone encounters and alot of the most standard  solutions seem to really fall short.

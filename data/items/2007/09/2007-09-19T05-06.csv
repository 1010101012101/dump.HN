It scrapes the front page, figures out which stories have commenters in common, and plots it in polar coordinates.  The radial coordinate is the total number of comments, on a logarithmic scale (with the inner 1/3 or so reserved to reduce clutter).  The angular coordinate attempts to cluster together stories with similar commenters.  It updates every 6 hours, and there's a delay while scraping to keep from overloading PG's server.<p>A lot of the features (animation, selection, title/domain swapping) are basically gratuitous - I wanted to get more practice with JQuery since I need that functionality in my startup.  Hell, the whole thing is basically gratuitous.  But it was pretty fun to write.<p>John was working on a scraper for Reddit...that may be a bit more interesting, since it updates more frequently and the larger audience means more posts in common.",1190181591

56735,comment,56626,56696,0,0,Readmore,,,"I remember hearing about someone making a 'desktop' out of firefox. That would be the perfect way to implement some of the extra functionality he's talking about. Just run a browser as your window manager. Then you could build your interpreter into that and copy and paste between web applications as much as you want.",1190180767

I think this is one of the key things Flash had to make its strong start (besides being fast and small) - as a bundle with IE<p>then again I'm not sure how much freedom MS has this time around (anti-trust lawsuits and I think there may be some more pending settlements) or it would have been done with .NET on Windows already<p>I could be premature - but I still think Adobe will eventually own web ui in the future... assuming that they eventually get it right on mobile devices",1190180267

I would like to understand better how many Yahoo stores there are, how many are inactive, how many use the different services Y provides (shipping, inventory, etc.)  Is it fair to say that Yahoo hasn't added many features to the stores since Viaweb?  There are a lot of functions which Yahoo store operators have to perform which Yahoo has never added provisions for.",1190180223

56729,comment,56626,56697,0,0,natrius,,,"I'm surprised that you're the first person to point this out. That's the first thing I thought of when I read this:<p><i>""But then somebody you've never heard of, some bratty Y Combinator startup, maybe, is gaining ridiculous traction selling NewSDK, which combines a great portable programming language that compiles to JavaScript, and even better, a huge Ajaxy library that includes all kinds of clever interop features.""</i><p>No, it won't be some bratty Y Combinator startup. It'll be Google (but the Facebook/Twitter integration features won't be there, mainly because they're silly).<p>Even when GWT matures into the world-dominating SDK Joel speaks of, I still won't use it. To paraphrase jwz: Some people, when confronted with a problem, think, ""I know, I'll use Java."" Now they have two problems.<p>I'm waiting for someone to generate Javascript from Java through GWT from Javascript through Rhino. I wonder if that's possible...",1190179603

56725,comment,56626,56626,0,0,paul,,,"He has some interesting ideas and analogies, but it's not clear that Joel actually understands AJAX/JS. The browser incompatibility problems are largely overblown, and the most annoying limitations are imposed by the browser (meaning that no JS library is going to fix them). He also doesn't seem to realize that all of the Google JS running in his browser IS generated by a compiler (from JS in most cases, from Java in a few others).",1190179092

The actual pleasure of playing a game comes from the brain learning to recognize patterns.  But the aiming seems completely random, making it frustrating, not fun.

What I fail to believe is that this is going to be a language or a SDK.<p>Instead the real war in the internet will be who will keep your data together and present it to you in a uniform way.

56719,comment,56496,56511,0,0,brett,,,"I got a beta invite a couple weeks ago and tried it out. It's pretty useful. Integration with the first two accounts I entered was really easy once I decided to commit and give them my credentials. I noticed later integration with another bank was much more complicated due to the security measures on the bank's site. Mint did a good job of explaining why they needed so much info and how to extract if from the bank's site. <p>Categorization of transactions is done really well. Most things were categorized correctly by default and I like the ui for manual categorization. You get one big overlay with every possible category visible at once. <p>My main complaint so far is how many times they've emailed me so far. This is aggravated by the number of places I've had to ferret out to get the emails to stop. There isn't one email pref page; you have some global email preferences and then preferences for each account that operate independently. ",1190178093

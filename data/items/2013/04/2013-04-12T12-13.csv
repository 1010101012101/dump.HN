That's because the data are not from a random sample of the relevant population. One professor of statistics, who is a co-author of a highly regarded AP statistics textbook, has tried to popularize the phrase that ""voluntary response data are worthless"" to go along with the phrase ""correlation does not imply causation."" Other statistics teachers are gradually picking up this phrase.<p>-----Original Message----- From: Paul Velleman [SMTPfv2@cornell.edu] Sent: Wednesday, January 14, 1998 5:10 PM To: apstat-l@etc.bc.ca; Kim Robinson Cc: mmbalach@mtu.edu Subject: Re: qualtiative study<p>Sorry Kim, but it just aint so. Voluntary response data are worthless. One excellent example is the books by Shere Hite. She collected many responses from biased lists with voluntary response and drew conclusions that are roundly contradicted by all responsible studies. She claimed to be doing only qualitative work, but what she got was just plain garbage. Another famous example is the Literary Digest ""poll"". All you learn from voluntary response is what is said by those who choose to respond. Unless the respondents are a substantially large fraction of the population, they are very likely to be a biased -- possibly a very biased -- subset. Anecdotes tell you nothing at all about the state of the world. They can't be ""used only as a description"" because they describe nothing but themselves.<p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tstart=36420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tsta...</a><p>For more on the distinction between statistics and mathematics, see ""Advice to Mathematics Teachers on Evaluating Introductory Statistics Textbooks""<p><a href=""http://statland.org/MyPapers/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MyPapers/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p>and ""The Introductory Statistics Course: A Ptolemaic Curriculum?""<p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>I think Professor Velleman promotes ""Voluntary response data are worthless"" as a slogan for the same reason an earlier generation of statisticians taught their students the slogan ""correlation does not imply causation."" That's because common human cognitive errors run strongly in one direction on each issue, so the slogan has to take the cognitive error head-on. Of course, a distinct pattern in voluntary responses tells us SOMETHING (maybe about what kind of people come forward to respond), just as a correlation tells us SOMETHING (maybe about a lurking variable correlated with both things we observe), but it doesn't tell us enough to warrant a firm conclusion about facts of the world. The Literary Digest poll<p><a href=""http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/</a><p><a href=""http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf</a><p>is a spectacular historical example of a voluntary response poll with a HUGE sample size and high response rate that didn't give a correct picture of reality at all.<p>When I have brought up this issue before, some other HNers have replied that there are some statistical tools for correcting for response-bias effects, IF one can obtain a simple random sample of the population of interest and evaluate what kinds of people respond. But we can't do that here on HN.<p>Another reply I frequently see when I bring up this issue is that the public relies on voluntary response data all the time to make conclusions about reality. To that I refer careful readers to what Professor Velleman is quoted as saying above (the general public often believes statements that are baloney) and to what Google's director of research, Peter Norvig, says about research conducted with better data,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>that even good data (and Norvig would not generally characterize voluntary response data as good data) can lead to wrong conclusions if there isn't careful thinking behind a study design. Again, human beings have strong predilections to believe certain kinds of wrong data and wrong conclusions. We are not neutral evaluators of data and conclusions, but have predispositions (cognitive illusions) that lead to making mistakes without careful training and thought.<p>Another frequently seen reply is that sometimes a ""convenience sample"" (this is a common term among statisticians for a sample that can't be counted on to be a random sample) of a population offers just that, convenience, and should not be rejected on that basis alone. But the most thoughtful version of that frequent reply I have previously seen in online discussion did correctly point out that if we know from the get-go that the sample was not done statistically correctly, then even if we are confident (enough) that HN participants are young, we wouldn't want to extrapolate from that to conclude that the users of any technology site are young, or that users of the Internet as a whole are young.<p>On my part, I wildly guess that most HNers are younger than I am in part because this kind of poll recurs often on HN. Other preoccupations of younger rather than older people make up frequent topics on HN, and I've tried looking for signs that there are large hidden numbers of old participants here without finding many.",1365770074

I think you already said you were planning a CRUD test.  Consider a tunable ratio here, something like 10000 R to 100 U to 10 C to 1 D.<p>2. Exercising synchronous web service (JSONP) calls in two modes: (a) to some web service that is consistently fast and low latency, say, the initial JSON example from this test suite running in servlet mode, and (b) to a web service written in the same framework as the one being tested, again using the initial JSON example.<p><i>(The idea here is that many frameworks fall on their faces when confronted with latency.  This is why synthetic tests are usually so poorly predictive of real world behavior -- people forget that latency causes backlogs and backlogs cause all parts of the stack to misbehave in interesting ways.)</i><p>3. Test async ability if the framework has it, with a system call (sleep?) that takes a randomized 0 - 60 seconds to return. Would help understand when a framework is likely to blow up calling out to a credit card processor, doing server side image processing, etc.<p>4. Exercising authentication (standardize on bcrypt, but only create passwords on 1 in 10K requests), authorization, and session state, if offered.<p>5. Exercising any built-in support for caching, where 1 in rand(X) requests invalidates the DB query cache, 1 in rand(X) requests invalidates the WS call cache, 1 in rand(X) requests invalidates the long term async system call cache, and 1 in rand(Y) requests blows away the whole cache.<p>For the enterprise legacy integrators, it would also be interesting to test XML as well (in particular, SOAP), anywhere we're testing JSON.",1365769853

Markup is reserved for higher-level things and is not done within Unicode.</i><p>Well, I’m not sure what authority you’d cite for your statements about what is or is not Unicode’s concern, but right on page 3 in chapter 1 we have:<p>“The Unicode Standard began with a simple goal: to unify the many hundreds of conflicting ways to encode characters, replacing them with a single, universal standard. [...] Whenever textual data was converted between different programs or platforms, there was a substantial risk of corruption.”<p>That sounds familiar, given the various contexts I mentioned before. I wonder whether the cost of all the software bugs ever caused by getting quoting/escaping wrong is greater than other repeat offenders like dereferencing nulls.<p>Then on page 8 in chapter 2 there are several explicit text processes mentioned, including user interaction and treating text as bulk data.<p>I do understand that a basic principle of Unicode is to represent plain text rather than mark-up, but it seems to me that avoiding problems with representing widely used text strings in different ways using different quoting and escaping conventions is consistent with that principle and exactly the kind of lack of standardisation that Unicode should help with.<p>There are already more than 60 control characters in Unicode. There are also many characters that aren’t described as control characters but which convey things like layout information or rendering hints, such as the non-breaking space, soft hyphen, and direction controls. I know that language tags are deprecated, but those are rather complicated and context-specific and, as the standard itself observes, supporting them is a significant burden on implementers, so I don’t think it is reasonable to equate that situation with what I suggested.<p>On balance, as a practical matter, if you're working in a text-only medium, your character set is all you have. If anything else must be done using some form of mark-up <i>built with the same character set</i>, then a simple, unambiguous, standardised way to switch from one to the other seems entirely consistent with the general goals of the Unicode project.<p>Links to relevant sources:<p><a href=""http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/ch01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/ch01.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/ch02.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/ch02.pdf</a>",1365769778

This powers ShareLaTeX and ScribTeX, and I'm really keen for others to use it, and for the standard to evolve with more focus than just what I decide to add on a whim! As far as I'm aware, it's the only documented API for calling an online LaTeX compiler, and the design of the API is meant to be separate from the backend, so that the other online services could also expose a compatible API. If you're interested in perusing some sort of integration for LyX, then we need to talk further! My email address is in my profile.",1365768124

Life is short and you only get one shot at it, so if you get a lot of enjoyment out of a new car every 5 years, hell, go for it. Be smart about it, make sure it's something you really enjoy and not just a temporary distraction, but do it if it brings you lasting enjoyment.<p>Some people, in my experience, really enjoy being frugal. Having a wad of cash in the bank is what makes them feel secure and happy. Others, not so much. To each their own.<p>One nice thing, being able to live reasonably happily on $25k is nice to see if nothing else than that's probably what a lot of today's middle classers are likely to get in SS benefits down the road. And given the dismal savings rates, that's a fine thing. The trick is to pull it off you need to have a paid for home and live in a relatively affordable location.<p>Of course that's another thought, retiring at 30 means your SS benefits are going to be small or non-existent. If this guys rental properly burned down and his investments tanked, that could turn into a pretty bad situation someday. As much as I hate to rely on SS for retirement it's the closest thing to a guaranteed income many of us are going to get, and retiring early means opting out of that.",1367031509

5616562,comment,5609445,5612989,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"> So you're ignoring the stored energy vs. energy storage distinction. Yes, yes, oil and coal are storing energy from the sun from a  billion years ago.<p>While that's an astute observation, it's not my point.<p>It's also somewhat imprecise:  most petrochemical deposits were made ~650 - 65 million years ago.  But that's just a nit.<p>I'm not concerned with where and when existing hydrocarbons were deposited.  Merely their very high energy density and (for now) extremely high prevalence.  High enough that it's more feasible to operate cars by <i>combusting</i> petroleum than it is to run them on batteries with 10 year lifetimes and 93% recoverability in recycling, <i>simply because there isn't enough accessible lithium on the planet to create enough batteries to replace the cars already on the road</i>.<p>Even if you had a cost-effective energy source, lithium-ion batteries aren't going to give us enough storage capacity.  Due to a shortage of storage medium, not energy.<p>Which means something else has to give:  we don't all own private automobiles (leasing or hiring autonomous vehicles when needed might make this possible).  Or we use other storage media:  lead-acid, flywheels, compressed air.  Or, as you suggest (and I suspect), synthetically generated hydrocarbons, either liquid or gas.<p>The known efficiencies of this last process are low:  at best, maybe 10% of incident sunlight, more likely somewhere between 0.1% to 1%.  Which is actually far better than the net efficiency of the production of existing fossil hydrocarbons, it's just that they've accumulated over hundreds of millions of years.  As the paper below illustrates, in <i>one</i> year (1997), human fossil fuel consumption amounted to some 422 <i>times</i> the plant matter fixed via photosynthesis (net primary productivity or NPP).  Fossil fuel consumption from 1751 - 1998 corresponds to over 13,300 years of NPP.  Which is actually somewhat less than I'd have thought.<p>Net photosynthetic efficiency is around 2.4%.  Conversion of biomass to hydrocarbons is the great unknown.  Transportation amounts for roughly 1/4 of global energy use.  I'll assume that large measures of this might be substituted by other than liquid fuels (EVs, human power, electrified passenger and freight rail, substituting high-speed rail for air), but a significant portion of long-haul land, water, and virtually all air traffic will likely require a highly dense chemical fuel.  That will mean one or more of:  synthetic (carbon-neutral) hydrocarbons, carbon offsets while continuing to use fossil fuels (while they last), and/or a hell of a lot less transportation.  Or create a runaway greenhouse situation.<p>Frankly none of the options is great.<p>Replacing <i>all</i> present fossil fuel use with existing biomass would require 22% of the <i>present</i> total primary productivity of the planet, a 50% increase of the amount of NPP humans already consume.  And that's if we're counting on using biomass directly, not relying on conversion to other forms (e.g.: ethanol), which drastically reduces net photosynthetic conversion efficiency.  Last time I checked, we don't typically run cars on wood or straw (though ships once ran predominantly on solid coal).<p><a href=""http://globalecology.stanford.edu/DGE/Dukes/Dukes_ClimChange1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globalecology.stanford.edu/DGE/Dukes/Dukes_ClimChange...</a>",1367029873

Given that, it's trivially easy to retire by 50 or even 40 for most people; for a software developer (like MMM), it's quite possible to do it by 30.<p>Honestly, though, I would argue that his plan gives him a sense of false security: no one knows what the economy will look like in ten years, let alone twenty or thirty, and building his retirement on the assumption nothing drastic will change in it or his personal life is folly.<p>And he spent the first... seven or so years of his working life in some soul-sucking corporation. That's a shit load of time wasted. So his problem?<p>I'd say it's that he retired too late.<p>If you take his definition of retirement as ""having enough money that you can do what you want to do,"" all you probably actually have to do is save up 100k-200k, plus or minus a bit. That's because most people want to have some integration into the economy; they just want it on their terms. And integration into the economy means you're getting paid some amount. Given a fluid nest egg to last you a frugal decade or so really gives you all the financial security you need. (Of course, shit can happen, but any shit that can burn through that kind of nest egg is likely to ruin whatever plans you have anyways.)<p>If you have $200k saved up at this point and no real commitments but have grand plans for how you'll retire sometime in the next five to ten years and then do what you really want to do--teaching, or open source projects that interest you, or traveling around the world as a photographer/blogger--more likely than not you can do it now, within a year. You should. Money will come to you, and there's no reason to put off your dreams.",1367028782

5616506,comment,5616143,5616143,21,0,sethrin,,,"On the one hand, I agree with most everything MMM says. On the other hand, a life of consumerism is its own reward -- and who is to say it is not earned?<p>I am nomadic. I have no dependents, and a severe case of wanderlust. My impression, after many conversations on the matter, is that this is a mild form of insanity. I think that I have my lifestyle more or less sorted out at the moment, but I have in the past been more or less willing to trade stability and an income above the poverty line for the freedom to search for a place that perhaps I want to live. I'm from Alaska originally, and don't particularly enjoy or identify with the rest of the US, so hopefully this is at least somewhat understandable.<p>I digress. I know exactly the kind of perspective from which $25k per annum is considered wealth. I also know the freedom  that comes from not being owned by possessions -- and I hope that MMM does as well. You can still practice accumulation on a budget, but it's hard to see that as a healthy motivation. Being rich is not dying with the most toys. Although I don't believe the majority the HN community would agree with that sentiment.<p>To be a nomad, you are forced to make a very deliberate choice about every possession. Each one adds a burden that must be carried to each new place -- quite literally carried, in my income bracket. There is the temptation to transform this practicality into a moral virtue, but there are many other reasons besides.<p>On the other hand, there are many virtues in accumulation. Besides the advantages conveyed by a visible display of wealth, owning many things serves as a buffer against misfortune. Consumer goods provide pleasure, and capital assets can be themselves a source of profit.<p>I feel like  I should be the most fervent disciple of MMM, and yet I would say instead: neglect not your comforts, nor your consumerism. The trades you may make in pursuit of a purer life, are at the least uncomfortable, and at worst dangerous. Poverty may be virtuous, and while you may yet find that virtue, seek it not for its own sake. If your charity compels you to be poor, accept that with good heart, and do not be miserly no matter how much you own. If, alternately, you are not compelled towards sainthood, at the least enjoy your comforts in the knowledge that you are living a blessed life, which  may like as not never come again.",1367028271

Not a long one, but something that makes you clear your head, focus on your body and your health, and starting missing creating cool stuff. If your mind's constantly occupied with day-to-day concerns, you can be overwhelmed and it's hard to regain focus.<p>If you can afford it, change your scenery a bit and go hiking or get away to a beach for a week, 'til you get bored of it.<p>What is your goal in making a startup? If you can get a continual sense of reward from accomplishing these things, that'll keep you going :)",1206622706

Most implementations are not what he intended -- at one Smalltalk Solutions keynote he excoriated all of us.  He said that he never intended Smalltalk to become a programming language.  He wanted to create a Montessori toy for the mind.  That said, I don't think that Smalltalk as a programming language is that far from what he intended.  He just never intended it to stop there.",1206621101

I think this has some real potential given the runaway success of YouTube, etc.<p>I'm not sure I like the overlay comments, but I suspect the Omnisio guys will work something out. Cut transitions are a little jarring at the moment, but I'm sure that can be fixed for version 1.1. :)<p>In any case, well done so far!",1206620107

It doesn't typically take down the browser as it used to as plugins are (I think) now run in a separate process on Opera and Firefox. Konqueror can still crash because of Flash. That said, I'm not running the latest version of Flash on Linux because it doesn't even work in anything but Firefox (or presumably anything not Gecko-based).<p>As far as I can tell, Flash is very stable on Safari on the Mac, there are probably subtleties in the Flash code that cause occasional breakage on non-Webkit browsers.<p>The whole plugin situation is a travesty anyway. Adobe don't care about anything but IE and Firefox on Windows, so Flash runs like crap on everything else. I suspect Apple paid Adobe to get Flash working properly on Mac OS X + Safari.",1206619695

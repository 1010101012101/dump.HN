The city I live in (Cork) is just an hour flight from London, and it costs 30 ($40) return including taxes and charges on Ryanair.

3714085,comment,3712626,3714008,3,0,halostatue,,,"The specifics of this situation was that my wife was declaring several bags of ketchup-flavoured potato chips, which are quite popular in Canada but virtually unknown in the U.S. My wife said that a lot of people liked them, and his statement was something on the order of ""they can't be that good because they're not available in America.""<p>So, yes: he told my wife that he believes that products available in America are superior to products available in Canada; it's not a far stretch to say that he ""absolutely didn't want to experience anything Canadian, because everything American is obviously superior."" Further, it's also not a big stretch to suggest that this man should be cycled back to the U.S. because he's an absolutely horrendous ambassador for Americans.<p>Your other statement (""ICE is a minor problem"") is complete nonsense given the discussion at hand. ICE is often the first American face a foreigner sees coming into the U.S. The arrogance (and other negative attributes) displayed by <i>many</i> ICE officers is absolutely a problem for America, because it's a bad impression.<p>I don't travel much to the U.S. (at most once or twice a year, and sometimes less despite the fact that most of my extended family is in the U.S.), and as an American citizen I can't be refused entry. Inasmuch as that matters, I don't care how asinine these folks are. However, I care deeply when the first view of Official America that a foreigner gets is someone with a bad attitude and distrust and/or dislike for non-Americans. (I also think that any ICE officer who is stationed in a foreign country needs to act like they like that foreign country and skip the whole America First act that I've seen far too often at Toronto Pearson. It's offensive.)<p>EDIT: I'm rather offended that your immediate assumption is that someone is making something up when they say something. Maybe you haven't experienced it, but the Ugly American Syndrome is alive and well. It bothered me as a U.S. military brat when my father was stationed in both the Netherlands and in Japan, and it bothers me as an adult expat (and now dual citizen). America's a great place and has great people, but if you work for the government and are stationed in a foreign country, you <i>are</i> America to the people you're around. Act like you're representing your country well and don't be an ass.",1331916845

If a title bump is included, then the question becomes--is that what the company wants?  If he becomes a manager, will one of his team want to be team lead?  If a director, a manager?<p>Second, the line between a Sr. SysAdmin and a manager is a fine one.  Often, it's the size and bureaucratic-leanings of the company which determine which side of the line one falls.<p>In the case of your ""employee"", much of what he does lines up with the duties/responsibilities of a SAGE Level 4 systems administrator ( <a href=""http://static.sage.org/pubs/8_jobs/chapter1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.sage.org/pubs/8_jobs/chapter1.pdf</a> ).  But, it also lines up with what one would typically think of a manager's responsibilities.  Once again, company dependent.<p>Third, you never told us his current salary or range thereof.  Maybe he is in a competitive range already.  The last SAGE salary survey is from 2007--a bit dated with all the economy has been through.  But in 2007, the national average for a Level 4 sysadmin was around $90K.

I plugged some data at random (12 years experience, Columbus, OH, $80K/yr salary, etc) on PayScale.  For a Sr. SysAdmin, $80K is at the 62nd percentile; $75K is average.  For a Network Ops Manager, $80K is right on the average for that area.<p>Of course, you could also speak with your HR department to have them pull local salary surveys.<p>But what it REALLY comes down to is this. He's done some comparison shopping. Based upon what he's found, believes he's not being fairly compensated for what he does.  He likes the company, likes his co-workers, etc, and is giving you guys the first shot at ""making things right"" in his mind.  From your standpoint, he's highly competent and a good cultural fit.

Those pipedreams will follow you to the grave, and no one will speak of them when you're no longer around to do so. But the world <i>will</i> reward you for the one idea you managed to bring to life. Maybe you won't strike gold, and maybe you won't become a ""rock star"" fixture on the scene of your choice. But you'll have created something real. You will have turned your time into great personal meaning, and, hopefully, into value for others. And, if nothing else, you'll have learned that becoming good at the task is more important than what started the task.

I enjoyed the status that this self-imposed job description bestowed upon me -- or, more accurately, upon my own self perception.

No. Instead, I focused on my ""day job,"" and continued to nurse the daydream.<p>Maybe something about turning 30 brought things into focus for me.

The biggest advantages of a downpayment are protecting against just the sorts of problems we've seen. For one, saving up a downpayment shows that you are a fiscally responsible person with stable employment in the past. For another, it gives you instant equity and protects you against being upside down due to market fluctuations.<p>You put in your downpayment and a year or two of mortgage payments and even in the market goes down a bit you still have enough equity to avoid being trapped.

People don't just step down a rung though, it's not some ideal efficient labor market, they just use seniority to stay where they are. While it's  obvious that a decade or two of experience can trump the 20-something hotshot more often than not - IQ peaks in the 20s and then declines but it's not as useful as people think versus experience - I am not so certain that the experience of someone in their late 60s or mid 70s can outweigh the cognitive decline they will experience (new medical research might hold some promise there I suppose).",1331915006

And educational institutions themselves are deeply political - D/R ratio in some academic disciplines is 30/1, some institutions are completely ideologically monocultural, and teacher's union NEA is 6th biggest political donor, donating almost exclusively to one party. There are also numerous documented cases of teachers involving pupils into political activities for the causes of their choosing. So it would be very hard to find an education venue where indoctrination would not take place.<p>The whole point of the homeschooling (one of) is that people choose what is actual education for them, not for somebody else. Of course, you or I may not like their choice, but why should they care?",1331914504

In NaCl you have an environment that lets you take C/C++ code and deploy programs written in that code to the browser. The Python interpreter (and the ones for several widespread languages) is written in C. Why not put the two together?<p>I've seen a proof-of-concept of this on webOS, which is essentially a browser since JavaScript programs can run natively. In webOS 1.4.5 and above, there is the PDK, which is a library that lets you make C/C++ programs compatible with webOS and run them on-device. Part of the PDK is the plugin interface, which allows JavaScript code to call C-compiled functions, which the C-compiled program exposes to JavaScript with special PDK functions.<p>Since the Python interpreter is in C, it can be adapted with the PDK to allow Python programs to run natively. Here is a post demonstrating it:<p><a href=""http://www.ezequielaceto.com.ar/techblog/?p=359"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ezequielaceto.com.ar/techblog/?p=359</a><p>In Chrome, NaCl is analogous to the PDK, so why not have Python as an NaCl plugin and use it to run Python in the browser?

I can't blame people who didn't take us seriously, because we ourselves didn't take that first summer program seriously in the very beginning.</i><p>I attended the ""How to Start a Startup"" talk in 2005. I remember going home and reading pg's website, the whole thing, cover-to-cover.  Later that year I met Steve Wozniak at the first Startup School held in Cambridge.  Woz, Chris Sacca and pg left a lasting impression on me. I had never witnessed that level of information density and knowledge sharing. Amazing to look back at those humble beginnings. Always grateful for YC and the HN community.",1331913686

The tax structure encourages this kind of behavior, but the day I quit my job 5 years ago I started cutting a check for my own health insurance. If people actually looked into the cost of catastrophic coverage with a high deductible (the point of ""insurance"" in the first place), they'd see that it's not as expensive as they think. It's getting more expensive thanks to government interference, but all insurance is affected similarly.<p>Pay cash for regular visits. Save money instead of buying toys, and magically you don't fall into the trap of ""I have to choose between food and health coverage.""",1331913671

I'm sure you've all seen the promotions for the service in any O'Reilly book you purchase.  I'm a subscriber, and it's a great service.  I get electronic access to almost every book in the O'Reilly library, plus books from a number of other tech publishers, all for a little over $20 a month ($45 if you want to get rid of the 10 books/month limit).<p>It's been great for when I need to review some new technology (e.g., HTML5) but don't want or need to read an entire book about the topic in question.  And it works great on my Kindle.  Also -- and I'm sure O'Reilly is aware of this -- when I find something particularly good on Safaribooksoline, I sometimes end up purchasing the ""deadtree"" version of such books so I can have a physical book to read when I'm away from the computer/Kindle.",1331913657

I think society as a whole benefits from increases in home ownership (homeowners are stakeholders in neighborhoods). I think the tax code can either be simple or effective.<p>You are free to disagree at length with both of those beliefs and I won't fault you for doing so, except that if the best argument you can muster is ""no fair, I just want to rent"" I may roll my eyes.<p>But the thing I really wanted to point out is, there are 104905480 things we can debate on HN where a change of perspective might be productive. This isn't one of them; the mortgage interest tax deduction is a psychological pillar of the middle class of the US and eliminating it would be painfully disruptive to huge numbers of voters.<p>Narcotics will be decriminalized nationwide before we lose deductible mortgage interest, is my prediction. People have strong feelings about drugs, too, but the decision to legalize them or not doesn't change whether they can still afford the cable bill.",1325980782

3438426,comment,3437028,3437852,4,0,jsnell,,,"In this case there is not even any reverse engineering as such. These are values that IIUC Fruit computes at startup while Rybka has them precomputed. What that section was showing was merely that these tables were most likely computed using the code from Fruit, but with scaled and (automatically?) adjusted weights.<p>So you're totally correct in that displaying the hypothetical source code in such situation was questionable. It's not a horribly strong bit of evidence, and as an isolated incident, this would hardly be interesting. But as one more piece in a pattern of persistent copying, more so. In particular, it's worth noting that e.g. the code from earlier versions of Fruit would require larger changes than just tweaking these weights to generate the same output tables, making it pretty unlikely that this is just a case of convergent evolution.<p>So if the PST tables are weak, what's the stronger evidence?<p>First of all, there's the circumstances of the rebirth of the project:<p>- Older versions of Rybka were indisputably based on Crafty.  (Including replicating some harmless bugs in exactly the same places as a certain version of Crafty, making it possible to pinpoint the point of plagiarism fairly closely to a specific Crafty version).<p>- After Fruit was released, suddenly Rybka loses all the similarity to Crafty, and acquires similarities to Fruit. 
This coincides with:<p>++ Rybka becoming a dramatically stronger player.<p>++ Rybka losing features that it previously had in support code.<p>++ Rybka gaining new idiosyncracies in support code, matching those of Fruity.<p>++ Rybka losing some game playing / evaluation features that it (and Crafty) previously had but Fruit didn't.<p>++ Rybka suddenly acquiring an evaluation feature set that is a very close match to those of Fruity. Very close, as in 
much closer than any unrelated engines are to each other, than previous versions of Rybka to the then current versions, or that version of Rybka to much later versions.<p>++ Rybka suddenly acquiring new fairly arbitary data structures that match those of the same specific version of Fruit, while not matching those of other Fruit version (e.g. the hash structure).<p>And probably other things, it's been a while since I read the papers.<p>It's very surprising to me that somebody could read through all of the evidence and believe there's no foul play going on. It seems totally unreasonable to assume that he first wrote from scratch a chess engine that managed to very exactly replicate the foibles of a top open source engine, then threw all of that code out and rewrote from scratch a new engine that happened to replicate the idiosyncracies of 
a completely unrelated and stronger open source engine.<p>It seems much more believe that substantial parts of the code of Rybka were copied verbatim from Fruit, and that other substantial parts were ported over to use a different structure in a way that's not really showing a lot of creativity.<p>Did Rajlich also substantially improve on the code? Clearly at some point he must have, it did eventually become a much stronger program. It's hard to say how much of this original innovation there was in Rybka 1/2, which as I understand are the particularly contentious versions.<p>Did Rybka later evolve beyond the Fruity origings? Almost certainly so.<p>Does any of that excuse either violating the GPL or claiming that it was all his own work, at most ""inspired"" by others? Clearly not.",1325980588

3438420,comment,3436244,3438350,3,0,joebadmo,,,"Thanks for the thoughtful response.<p><i>That certainty is a sign of ignorance and therefore I am ignorant because I am certain is false because that argument is circularly invalid. This statement: ""If you are certain about something, it's time to re-examine your assumptions."" Seems pretty certain to me.</i><p>Ha, I love the meta-cognitive logic judo! It's a fair point, but I hope the subtext of my entire meta-point is that I regard my opinions with little certainty. Even my defense of affirmative action as a policy is measured, because I think it's a very complex issue that I'm not an expert on. Maybe a better way to put it would've been: ""When I'm certain about something, I find that it's generally time to re-examine my assumptions.""<p>But again, what I take issue with is that your argument starts with the premise that college admissions should be about past performance.<p><i>However, I do fully grapple with the opposing arguments that are in favor of Affirmative Action. I just reject them. I understand their side, I've just been lead to believe it is suboptimal.</i><p>If you did, I missed it. AA is about equal opportunity. It's about providing opportunities to people who are circumstantially impoverished of them.<p><i>I don't know and I don't care because to me it is racist to favor or disfavor one group based on race.</i><p>From behind Rawls's veil of ignorance and with the premise that education leads to higher wages, one's race should have no bearing on whether they can get into college. If one race is systematically denied that opportunity, then it's racist to not address that systematic oppression.<p>Now there are plenty of premises there to argue with, but I didn't see you argue with any of them. You instead talked about certain consequences that you perceive from affirmative action that you find suboptimal. But suboptimal increase in tensions between sub-cultures is not something affirmative action was meant to address. Also:<p><i>If they are wrong, then their competitors are able to get black graduates cheaper, and, at the margin, grow faster.</i><p>It sounds like you're saying that companies that don't subscribe to us vs. them will then outperform companies that do, so it'll sort itself out.<p>So, what's the problem, then?<p>I apologize for resorting to ad hominem, I didn't mean to. The last thing I want is to start a flamewar. I should've phrased my response more carefully. The reason I brought up my meta-point is that I read a tone of certainty in your prose. I recognize both that that's subjective and that sometimes it's enlightening to stake a hard-line position and defend it vigorously.",1325980186

3438414,comment,3438031,3438031,6,0,d4nt,,,"This is good news for Microsoft, and I really do hope they do well, but there's still a mountain to climb: tech reviewers are not the same as normal consumers and impressing them for the limited period of time it takes to write a review does not necessarily translate onto having a successful product. Here are a few challenges Microsoft still face:<p>1. Getting the mobile networks to take handsets running Windows Phone.<p>2. Training handset retailers on this new platform and promoting it enough to ensure that these handsets are actively sold to consumers.<p>3. Their advertising and PR must not be lame, like Microsoft advertising sometimes is.<p>4. The UX must be consistently slick enough over a long period of time that word of mouth among non-technical people really takes hold and the phone moves beyond the early adopter segment of the market. Phones must run for several days without a reboot. Calls must not be dropped because of crashes. UI Lockups or moments where the slick facade falls away to reveal clunky technical menus are a big no no. And the inevitable bugs must be fixed and rolled out in a timely and seamless mannor. Otherwise, when Bob from accounts notices you have a Windows Phone and asks ""what's it like?"" he'll sense the hesitation in your voice and choose the iPhone.<p>5. If things start to work out, the team will need top level executive cover to prevent in-fighting or politics from ripping the team appart or forcing an unwanted technical strategy tax (think ""Windows Phone - Bing/Azure/Office Edition"") from destroying the product.<p>6. Microsoft need to make money from these things, otherwise the project will be shelved and resourced diverted to MS Office 2020.",1325979909

They simply have a huge, very unfair advantage against us, who do business legally.<p>2.) This is personal experience, a lot of them, not a single case, and common sense in Hungary.

There is really no reason that family concerns should inhibit the day to day activities of a start-up. There is also no reason that a start-up should be in a situation where employees are having to dedicate more than 60 hrs a week on a long term basis.

They definitely need better ways to highlight or identify elements with contextual menus. It's a guessing game at the moment, at least for me.<p>Really, my biggest gripe is the lack of apps that meet the same levels of functionality as their Android/iOS counterparts. I feel like the stock Twitter app is terrible and none of the other Twitter apps are as good as the top 5-6 on the other platforms. The same goes for Facebook. That comprises a large percentage of my usage outside of built-in functionality.<p>I will say though, I dig the People hub for managing all of the contact information. The social networking built in is good for at-a-glance usage but wouldn't replace a dedicated client for me.",1325977216

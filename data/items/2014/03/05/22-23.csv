7350588,comment,7350169,7350514,8,0,nonchalance,,,"The problem is that Mozilla&#x27;s policy applies to distribution but not necessarily to installation.  Since this is a legal issue, the details are very important.<p>In this case, the process of ensuring that a functioning version of Firefox resides on the machine involves:<p>1. Transferring the Firefox software to the machine<p>2. Explicitly preparing the machine so that the Firefox software can be run (in this case, installing Firefox)<p>The Policy only applies to the first item.  No part of the policy refers to the second action, and it&#x27;s fair game for Dell to charge a fee for the labor associated with installing the software (they cannot, of course, charge a fee for the part of the process where the software is distributed to the machine).<p>If this sounds like nitpicking, welcome to the world of law",1394060365

If you know have a proof that uses this interpretation of number that is tied to one particular &quot;implementation&quot;, then there is nothing incorrect about it leading to weird or &quot;meaningless&quot; results, they would be correct for SetsNumber but not for GeneralNumber (or someone might need to take a good look and see if they can be made to work for GeneralNumber too).<p>(I know, the words are all wrong, it probably sounds either &quot;all wrong&quot; or like a gibberish to mathematicians that don&#x27;t also happen to be programmers ...someone should figure out more appropriate terms :) )<p>And about leaky abstractions, I think they happen a lot in software because of the tradeoffs we make, like &#x27;but we also need access to those low level stuff to tweak performance&#x27;, &#x27;but we need it done yesterday so it&#x27;s no time to think it through and find the right mode&#x27; or &#x27;our model has contradictions and inconsistencies but it&#x27;s good enough at delivering usable tools to the end-user, so we&#x27;ll leave &quot;wrong&quot; because we want to focus on something that brings more business value right now&#x27; etc. Also, there&#x27;s a biggie: for some problems using no abstraction is not good enough (initial developing/prototyping speed is just to small), but if you figure out the right abstraction it will end up being understandable only by people with &#x27;iq over n&#x27; or &#x27;advanced knowledge of hairy theoretical topic x&#x27;, and you can&#x27;t hire just these kinds of people to maintain the product, so you knowingly choose something that&#x27;s leaky but works and can be maintained by mediocre programmers, hopefully even outsourced :)",1394059894

7350496,comment,7347735,7348197,5,0,IgorPartola,,,"You know what? Sometimes, it&#x27;s fine. You should not share a root account with other users. This advice comes from a time where you&#x27;d have the &quot;root password&quot; and log into remote servers that way. Then, when someone leaves your organization, you&#x27;d hopefully change the root password to make sure they person that left no longer has access.<p>However, there are some concrete cases where logging in as root is just fine:<p>- Making a database backup remotely. You have to give the backup user enough privileges to initiate a database dump, stop the database process, grab the backup, rotate the backups, start the database process up again. You can go through the giant pain of setting up the permissions just so, or you can put a separate SSH public key into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys and just let root do all of this.<p>- Initial VM setup. If you are automating something like provisioning EC2 instances, sure go ahead and set up individual users, but it&#x27;s a lot easier to first connect as root using your own keypair.<p>- A remote monitor that logs into a single purpose VM to restart a process. Same as the backups example, but more broad. Once again, you <i>could</i> set it up using specific users, but the system would be more brittle.<p>- Lots of other cases where root is really what you want and doing sudo won&#x27;t work because the session is not interactive.<p>I figure it this way: if I compromised a local account on a server, I&#x27;d just add `alias sudo=~/.bin/my-evil-sudo-that-emails-your-password` to your .bashrc. That way I&#x27;d get root without any local exploits in the kernel, etc. Basically, adding extra protection around the root account does nothing if you are a sudoer.<p>Some steps you can take to actually increase your security instead of following the advice that is so misunderstood:<p>- Set the root password to a long random string, then lose the string. `su` should never be used by anyone but root.<p>- Disable password logins. Period. Do this now, and do it everywhere.<p>- Disable password-based sudo. Use pam_ssh_agent_auth [1] to escalate privileges and ssh-agent to forward your key through your ssh session. I am not sure why this isn&#x27;t the default, but it really ought to be.<p>- Make sure your local key is encrypted with a strong passphrase. Once again, use ssh-agent to not have to enter the password every single time.<p>- Set up a VPN to access your servers and only allow ssh from the VPN.<p>- For the truly paranoid, set up two-factor auth over SSH. This is easy to do with Google Authenticator (it&#x27;s just a random number with the seed being shared and secret and the number being generated every 30 seconds), or using SMS which is just slightly more complex/costly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pamsshagentauth.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pamsshagentauth.sourceforge.net/</a>",1394059514

Or a neat WebGL demo. This is the former.<p>I totally agree with that, but I think it&#x27;s a tangential point to the one I was making. I certainly think that developers should only use javascript where it&#x27;s actually more convenient to do so than to use CSS, HTML and server-side code.<p>I personally find it extremely irritating navigating to sites which use javascript for something which naturally lends itself to another technique (like sites which request all text using javascript, as &#x27;bphogan&#x27; pointed out above).

As the line shrinks between desktop apps and web apps, we&#x27;ll have to find ways to make overcome the web&#x27;s shortfalls in interactive application development, namely state management and responsiveness. If the use of noscript increases, then this becomes harder to do, and makes it a lot less possible to make interactive web applications look like anything more than a poor mockery of interactive desktop applications.

7350410,comment,7347589,7347589,3,0,tedsanders,,,"Honest question: does it make sense for startups to hire inexperienced but smart people? Unlike big businesses, startups have less time to train/develop/mentor talent. They also usually have one focus: shipping product. Because of that, it seems better for startups to hire older, more experienced people who can be productive immediately. Of course there will be exceptions, but I think that on average big firms should hire fresh grads and startups should hire experienced workers. Is my thinking wrong?<p>Edit: I suppose the main benefit of hiring smart inexperienced people over smart experienced people is that you can hire more of them for the same price. Plus, maybe inexperienced people tend to be young, and young people tend to have more hours to devote to work? Are there other benefits I&#x27;m missing?",1394058710

I can&#x27;t find percentile charts from back then, but I believe the distribution has stayed roughly the same, which means that Yale has gone from a median score in the top 4% to one in the top 1%.[2] In 1976, about a million people took the SAT, so a top 4% score was a pool of about 40,000 potential students. In 2013, about 1.7 million people took the SAT, so a top 1% score was a pool of about 17,000 potential students.<p>So population growth explains part of it, and much of the rest can probably be explained by improved financial aid causing applications at Yale to go up by a higher percentage than the overall increase in number of test-takers.<p>What&#x27;s really telling is that, despite all the criticism of the SAT, Yale responded to the increasing number of applicants by using the SAT more aggressively to filter applicants. In other words, when faced with a larger applicant pool, Yale decided to reject students with SAT performance that it had previous deemed adequate, because it couldn&#x27;t think of any better criteria to use to distinguish the additional applicants.<p>[1] Yale&#x27;s data: <a href=""http://oir.yale.edu/sites/default/files/W032_Fresh_SATs_5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oir.yale.edu/sites/default/files/W032_Fresh_SATs_5.pd...</a>.

7350393,comment,7349607,7349895,40,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Iâm going to respectfully disagree with almost everything there, based on our experience.<p>TL;DR: The changes do not benefit us or our customers, caught us by surprise, and created customer support issues almost immediately. As a direct result, we are now working on moving to a stripe.js form where Stripeâs branding will be hidden as much as possible and we retain full control of our user experience.<p>I do want to start with my usual caveat that while Iâm discussing negatives here in the hope of promoting improvements, weâre generally positive about Stripe, and Iâve waxed lyrical about checkout.js specifically in the past. This appears to have been a blip and hasnât particularly shaken our general confidence as Stripe customers.<p>I should also acknowledge that I did promise to send the information below to one of Stripeâs people who replied to my e-mail several weeks ago, and I havenât; <i>mea culpa</i>. I might as well put it here for general discussion at this point.<p>So, weâre planning to dump Checkout for a few reasons, but first among them is that Stripe changed our usersâ experience for the worse, without our knowledge or consent. That simply shouldnât happen. I appreciate the desire to incrementally improve things, but not everyone will share the same views on what is an improvement, so pushing changes to our user experience in an uncontrolled way is not really acceptable to us.<p>For example, our customers typically sign up once for a subscription and then never enter their card details again, so the remember-me changes do absolutely nothing positive for them or us. On the other hand, almost the first customer we had sign up after the changes went live then contacted us to say heâd put in an incorrect phone number and could we please change it to a different one he mailed to us. Our first reaction was that we didnât collect phone numbers. This is how we discovered Checkout had been changed. Then we looked on the Stripe dashboard to see how to update the information, and itâs not there, so all I can do is mail the Stripe support team to ask for help (and, to be fair, they did, very quickly). So now Iâve gone from having a reasonably streamlined sign-up process to having a paying customer who is distressed because theyâve made a mistake <i>and I canât even fix it for them</i>. Epic fail.<p>We had similar reactions to the prompt for an e-mail address, when we had chance to watch some users signing up in person a few weeks ago (not watching them actually enter their card details, of course). Theyâd just entered their name, postal address and e-mail address on our create-account form, clicked through to pay by card, and now the next thing they get is a prompt for much the same details again! I think every person who signed up that day challenged something at this stage in the process, several being suspicious of spam.<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing to me, as someone whoâs seen overwhelmingly positive views of Stripe on forums like HN, is that the Stripe brand was a <i>clear negative</i> in the sign-up process. In the UK, Stripe is not a well-known organisation in the way that say a high street bank is, and we appear to be losing some level of business immediately because of the branding. For example, someone mailed us essentially asking why weâd let this Stripe organisation hijack our site. There was clearly some general uncertainty from that particular user â they also thought the Stripe form was not secure, because on their iPad it popped up in a separate tab and they didnât see the padlock icon in the usual place â but uncertainty is to be expected from non-technical customers.<p>I wanted to send them links to authoritative sources to prove that Stripe was legitimate, but this proved surprisingly difficult. Googling any likely variation of âStripe PCIâ or âStripe securityâ turned up more negative links than positive ones on the first SERP (justified, correct, or otherwise, there they were). When I searched for âStripe hackâ I found numerous links to a site called Hacker News, which of course is no surprise to us but more so for our non-geek customers. When I went to look up Stripeâs entry in the Visa Global Registry, as linked from their own site (<a href=""https://stripe.com/gb/help/faq#pci-compliance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stripe.com/gb/help/faq#pci-compliance</a>), it only showed them as operating in the US and Canada, but both we and our customer were in the UK.<p>So the bottom line is that weâre going to move away from both Stripe-controlled UX (where the changes have been a clear negative in our case) and the Stripe branding that comes with Checkout. Itâs a shame, because the idea is still a great one and obviously itâs more work for us to redo the integration, but when 100% of the customers youâre watching sign up donât like something about your sign-up process...",1394058470

The end of the paragraph said that reimbursements aren&#x27;t given for flights cancelled due to weather, safety, strikes, etc. I would be far less confused by the service if a simple answer was given here instead (don&#x27;t mention the EU stuff if you&#x27;re trying to reimburse Americans, and hopefully just put a single statement like &quot;Sorry, you are not eligible for reimbursement because your flight was cancelled due to weather&quot;.<p>Another question related not so much to the website but just the reimbursement service. For the particular IAH->LAX trip I was hoping to get reimbursed for, I had a Saturday flight delayed then cancelled, then got reschedule to Sunday morning, which got cancelled, and then got rescheduled to Monday (which actually went through). Could I attempt to get reimbursed for both cancellations or just one?",1394058275

Asking to pay for the services would not have been a jerk move, <i>because Amazon wasn't responsible for the extra costs either</i>. I usually root for the little guy, but in this case, if anyone else might be <i>expected</i> to foot the bill, it should be Google for building a system that needlessly slurps 250GB/h without any apparent capping or rate-limiting, <i>caused by a single spreadsheet</i>. Just because Amazon S3 is huge and probably doesn't feel a thing doesn't mean it's a good idea, what if it were 500 spreadsheets doing this?<p>What if that FeederBot were to gorge itself onto one Google's own CDNs? Sure it's probably just a drop in the ocean for Google as well, but I bet they'd rather not experience this ""minor inefficiency"".",1335441571

I'd like to firewall it such that it can only talk to my ISP's SIP server and other parties authorised by it. How do I do this? The firewall must deep-packet inspect SIP packets to work out what point-to-point RTP traffic should be allowed, and only allow this.

Au contraire, the upgrade manager takes care to disable third party repositories automatically.<p>Now, that doesn't mean that things are always flawless.  My main complaint is with a) bugs in the release itself, and b) the many reckless changes in paradigm, sometimes flawed by design, and implemented with half-finished software (upstart and Unity come to mind).  Because of a), I usually wait a month to upgrade.<p>b) is more serious, and though it sometimes isn't Canonical' s fault (I'm looking at you, Gnome!), it is why I dread dist-upgrades.  Finding reasonably functional and bug-free alternatives to the junk they want to shove down my throat sometimes takes months.  For instance, I have only just yesterday found a decent desktop to replace Gnome2 (Mint's Cinnamon), after being homeless since the release of 11.04.<p>Still, I wouldn't swap Ubuntu for any other distro (not even Mint, which is just another _buntu, so why bother)!  The PPA system is brilliant.  The community is huge, so even if bugs aren't fixed, workarounds and patches abound.<p>And last but not least, it's the only distro I can even <i>consider</i> doing a dist-upgrade with the hopes of having a working system after it's done.",1335441211

Because if it can indeed route my 10.something/192.168.something internal network, all the routers in between most likely can't. Maybe that's why because think NAT is safer: firewall holes are, in practice, much harder to exploit in IPv4.<p>(Well, that, plus the firewall rules are much simpler.

And obviously being able to make sure all accounts of a user are properly locked or deleted is more important to them than giggling at centrally storing potentially tens of thousands of passwords.<p>The system I know and maintain stores your current password and history in an encrypted form and protects them through various means, so if you got a full DB dump you would still have to brute-force.

It's actually called <i>IP masquerading</i>, and it does not protect you of anything.<p>Without a firewall rule that drops incoming packets, outside can readily reach your internal network with the proper route (your router already knows how to route external/internal, since it's its very role), even with NAT. The exact same incoming packet drop rule can readily be used with IPv6. And you can punch holes in the firewall for your internal services the same way you always did, you just don't need address swapping part anymore, nor ""port forwarding"", since all machines have all ports to them. In fact, the firewall stack actually gets two rules added each time you define a ""port forwarding"": the firewall rule to not drop the packet, and the NAT rule to forward it. Guess what forwards natively packets to the correct IPs? <i>Routing</i>. And that's precisely the purpose of NAT: being able to route IPs not meant to be routed in the first place, virtually extending the IP address space by having LAN machines sharing one address. The thing is, every IPv6 address is routable, hence NAT simply has no purpose in IPv6.<p>The only real problem is that people have been framed to think that NAT is how things work. The truth is, having no NAT anymore is a <i>bliss</i>. Everything is easier, from DMZ routing to authorization to abuse handling, mostly because many issues, limitations, and extra work vanish.<p>PS: and don't start me on ""NAT is good at using a single IP to connect to your machines"". That's what DNS is for.<p> except local-scoped addresses, but those are constrained to the link, since they are automatically assigned by the machine itself, and made to provide <i>automatic peer-to-peer link-local connectivity only</i>. By design, having only a link-local address means you have no internet connectivity whatsoever.",1335438814

Another method to ""tricking yourself into being awesome"" (also called <i>learning</i>) is to jump right in and start working on a project.  Like the author, you'll come up with loads of questions that need answering, and if your project is going to be successful, those questions <i>must</i> be answered.  Otherwise your project/startup will die.<p>Personal experience: this is exactly how I learned Ruby on Rails as a non-programmer.  I had an idea for a project, so I tried reading books and tutorials for months.  Nothing stuck.  It just didn't make sense.  I couldn't translate the words I was reading into code.  So I said ""screw it"" and started hacking away at my project, with absolutely no idea what I was doing.

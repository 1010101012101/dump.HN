Instead of then selling the property, they sell the shares, which is taxed as capital gains (instead of corporate income) for them.

Well, it&#x27;s\nwarm, soft, and moist (<i>succulent</i>) and\nis big on salt, black and/or hot red pepper,\nsweet, sour, fat, smoke, and the Malliard \nreaction.  So, it hits really\nhard on nearly all the <i>elements</i>\nas in:<p>Gray Kunz and\nPeter Kaminsky,\n&#x27;The Elements of Taste&#x27;.<p>For the <i>secret</i>, one of the\npillars has been explained\nby some <i>food chemistry</i> --\nkeep the proteins in the \nmeat fibers below 185 F.\nDo most of the cooking \nwith the meat at about 160 F\nfor melting the collagen.\nThen you do have <i>food safety</i>.<p>Overheat the meat fibers with the\nproteins, and they\nwill shrink, get rid of their\nwater, and become not good.<p>The long cooking times at\nrelatively low temperatures\nare to <i>melt</i> the collagen\nwithout overheating and, thus,\nruining the proteins.  \nSupposedly the proteins are\nalways tender; only the collagen\nis tough.  So, melt out the\ncollagen without ruining\nthe proteins.\nThe melted\ncollagen helps make the\nmeat moist and <i>succulent</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t know about beef\nbrisket BBQ -- it&#x27;s a\nTexas thing.  I was in Texas\nonly once, did have some of their\nbeef BBQ, and it was good.\nBut I don&#x27;t know how they do it.\nOn that trip to Texas, the story\nwent that some early immigrants\nwere German butchers, and they\nworked out how to BBQ brisket,\nno doubt, as a way to have people\nable to like that cut of meat.<p>For ribs, which I also don&#x27;t know\nabout, maybe the smoke plays\na really important role, e.g.,\nfor a <i>smoke ring</i>.<p>But for Memphis BBQ, picnic pork\nshoulder, I long suspected that\nall the smoke was mostly just\nadvertising <i>smoke</i> to attract\ndownwind customers\nand, really,\nnot very important to the\nfinal meat as served.  One reason\nis that about half the shoulder\nwas still covered by the skin.\nAnother reason was that for the\nrest of the meat, the ratio of\nsurface area exposed to the smoke \nto meat volume was\nrelatively small.<p>Another big secret (definitely\ndon&#x27;t tell anyone this one!):\nActually, get a good oven\nthermometer and carefully adjust\nyour oven to hold about 220 F.\nNot much higher than 220 F\nand maybe a little lower\n(don&#x27;t want the meat to\nget over 185 F).<p>Get a roasting pan and a\nroasting rack.  Put a \npicnic pork shoulder, say,\nskin side down, on the rack,\nwith a dry rub on the exposed\nmeat surface if you want,\nalthough I doubt that it\nwill contribute to the final\nproduct as served,\nplace it in the oven with\na meat thermometer deep \nin the meat but not next to\na bone (that might give a \nmisleading reading).<p>Cook to an internal\ntemperature of 185 F,\nmaybe a little less, not much more,\nfor maybe 16 hours.<p>Will get a lot of fat\nand melted collagen \nin the bottom of the roasting pan.<p>Place on a cutting\nboard, remove the skin,\nremove the meat from the\nbones (the arm bone and the\nshoulder joint),\nremove as much fat\nas you wish,\nand coarsely chop the rest.<p>Add favorite red BBQ sauce, likely\none with smoke flavor.<p>Place, likely with some salt\nand hot sauce,\non a white bread bun\nand top with\na simple white coleslaw.<p>It&#x27;s good.<p>Refrigerate what&#x27;s left;\nit reheats well in a\nmicrowave oven.<p>For the coleslaw, my quick\nguess at what Memphis has\nbeen doing is to take\na head of ordinary <i>green</i>\ncabbage, quarter it by\ncutting through the root,\nand cut out the solid, stiff\nstem parts.\nThinly slice the rest.\nAdd ordinary Ranch dressing\nand mix.\nDone.<p>Last time I bought\nabout 9 pounds of cabbage and\nused 127 ounces of shredded cabbage\nand 13.2 cups of dressing.  Might\ncut that back to, say, 12 cups.\nGot eight quarts.<p>No doubt Memphis was not using\nRanch dressing, but with my\nguess the results are not\ntoo far off.  I got the\nRanch dressing idea from\nthe back of a package of\nshredded cabbage for coleslaw.<p>So, here I&#x27;ve described\nhated <i>ersatz</i> <i>oven-Q</i>.\nIt&#x27;s also surprisingly good.<p>For doing BBQ, picnic pork shoulder\nis forgiving, from all I&#x27;ve seen\nmuch easier than beef or chicken.\nShould get good results if even\nroughly follow what I outlined.\nEven with pork, the shoulder is\nlikely much more forgiving than\nribs.<p>I have no desire to return to Memphis!<p>If my business does well and I retire,\nI want to go to, say,\nNew Hampshire,\nenjoy challenging the\nwinters with a 4 wheel drive\ncar with a lot of road\nclearance and big, aggressive\nsnow tires,\nattend operas, concerts, and\nlectures on mathematical\nphysics in Boston,\nfeast on New England seafood\nand maybe French, Italian,\nGerman, and\nChinese food,\nand, maybe, sometimes\nBBQ a pork shoulder!<p>Memphis?  Naw.<p>For the business, as of yesterday,\nI got all the planned software\nrunning.

Of course, the entirety of our argument is over the definition of religion.<p>| Unlike religions, cryonics is not exclusive.<p>I think we&#x27;d both agree that exclusivity isn&#x27;t the principle quality of religion, though many religions are exclusive.<p>Religions typically have some core set of beliefs - some of which may be untestable, ceremony, dress, and often attempt to explain the mysteries of the universe.  I&#x27;d also throw in the quality that religions advocate their followers either do something they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise do or abstain from something they would otherwise enjoy.  Its possible some religion lacks proscriptions for life, but I certainly haven&#x27;t met it.<p>Cyronics certainly has a core set of beliefs (faith!?) that lead to action. I very much doubt that even if we were to develop sufficient technology to unfreeze all those heads, future humans would do so.  Perhaps we&#x27;d unfreeze some heads for science and then a few more for the novelty.  We both agree cyronics is unlikely to work and that there is no way to run this experiment within our lifetime - cryonics requires faith (by any other name) in humanity and technology.<p>|In contrast, cryonicists rarely assign high probability to being revived. Most think of it like an experimental cancer treatment: Unlikely to work, but better than the alternative.<p>I know Christians that would describe their experience in similar terms.<p>| The most important difference between cryonics and religions is that religious people are typically convinced of the afterlife.<p>Christians believe in an afterlife, but not all religions do, or even weigh in on the matter - Judaism immediately comes to mind.  Apropos, cryonics proposes its own cycle of rebirth!  Well, possible rebirth until the great robot wars, the sun explodes, or the heat death of our local cluster.<p>As for the other attributes I mentioned - dress, ceremony, and the like, cryonics offers bracelets, (non)ceremonial decapitation with ensuing vitrification, and requires its devotees to die somewhere convenient!

I kind of disclaim the term &#x27;wage theft&#x27; because it brings in all sorts of legal connotations like breach of contract etc. It basically says that the law is the only thing that matters.<p>It makes much more sense to simply reason about what is morally correct (assuming we accept capitalism and the idea that employers deserve to dictate to employees to some degree).<p>In the full blown Marxist world view any appropriation of surplus value is essentially &#x27;wage theft&#x27;. Of course, if that were completely returned to workers, there would be no point in bothering with employees.<p>Instead, we can consider that if a worker has a wage low enough that their quality of life is really bad (e.g. complete inability to build capital as 100% of wage goes on absolute essentials), if there exists any more surplus value with which they could be paid more, it is reasonable for the employer to do so and unreasonable for them not to.<p>Is it &#x27;theft&#x27; not to? Well... no. In the same way that my landlord doesn&#x27;t &#x27;steal&#x27; my labour by exploiting the fact that buying property is difficult. It&#x27;s still not great though.",1432426144

Today&#x27;s USA Freedom Act is significantly watered down from last year&#x27;s version, and lacks the support of key privacy groups including ACLU and EFF (it is supported by the NSA and DEA, though). The USA Freedom is a fake reform bill that extends the PATRIOT Act and opens up new avenues for even more invasive spying.<p>Here are some gems from this so-called &quot;reform&quot; bill:<p>- The government can still use broad search selectors to target large portions of the population. They will be allowed to collect even more personal data from people &quot;connected&quot; to their primary targets.<p>- The bill expands the type of information the government is allowed to include VoIP calls and video chats, and likely will allow the government to access all data related to smartphone activity.<p>- Companies are rewarded with blanket immunity for sharing information with the NSA, even when they breach their own privacy agreements with consumers.<p>- The NSA can share data gathered for counterterrorism purposes with the FBI, which can then use the data for unrelated investigations with few meaningful limitations. This will allow the FBI to engage in parallel construction of criminal investigations unrelated to terrorism based.<p>- The public FISC advocate that USA Freedom creates for the FISA Court can be blocked from seeing anything the government wants to keep secret from them.<p>I&#x27;m relieved the Senate blocked this bill and hope this spells the beginning of the end for the PATRIOT Act. Check out my op-ed on The Hill for more info on why USA Freedom Act sucks: <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/242736-no-congress-did-not-just-vote-to-end-nsa-spying"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/242...</a>",1432426072

I heard a trillion dollar bailout was awarded, because those greedy scamsters were &quot;too big to fail&quot;.<p>One could also argue that &quot;technically the didn&#x27;t break the law&quot;. Which just proves the original argument. When you can abuse a system to get billions for your company, and then have the state get you out of trouble with public money unscratched (and you get to keep all your earnings), and that&#x27;s not considered a fraud, then it&#x27;s clear that &quot;laws against fraud&quot; ARE a tool of the rich, and have been designed so that their kind of crimes go unpunished.",1392972958

I could barely even bring myself to eat pure milk chocolate from them.

Then the store would deliver your order to you. I didn&#x27;t actually know how to make use of hardware devices like modems, but it was possible to make the user interface work reasonably well on a Macintosh LC II. I was of course bummed that there was no color. (HyperCard was black and white only unless you used proprietary extensions, which could sometimes make things run very slowly.)<p>The author of this post seems to think that HyperCard was &quot;before its time,&quot; but it wasn&#x27;t. It defined its time, and ours. It was a huge part of what made the Mac so appealing to so many people--the ability to sculpt new technology in a custom manner. There was no comparably easy-to-use tool on the PC--Visual Basic didn&#x27;t come close--and there never would be. The result was that all kinds of Mac owners developed their own stacks that solved exactly whatever problem they thought needed solving; PC owners had to hope that a software company would make something for them.<p>What&#x27;s sad is that now our computers are so much faster than the LC II I used in fifth grade, but even if they&#x27;re a hundred times faster, they&#x27;re certainly not a hundred times easier to develop for. Most fifth graders, even smart ones, probably couldn&#x27;t write an app in Objective-C that does today the same things a HyperCard stack did in 1994. HTML5 is the next best option, but it&#x27;s still not as easy.<p>I worked on a prototype of a modern-era web-based HyperCard with a friend, but we stopped working on it because there was no VC interest and it wasn&#x27;t clear if there would be a good business model. It&#x27;s a shame, because HyperCard is one of the things that most excited me about computers when I was a kid. I still miss it.",1392971342

The framework is of course PostgreSQL-only (and relies a lot on system catalog lookups).<p>My experience, backing what you are saying, is that if you know what you are doing, and you write good, maintainable stored procedures/UDF&#x27;s then the power is totally worth it.  Unfortunately, there are still some obstacles, and most of these are tooling.<p>I think the hatred of SQL from the parent (in the context of this quiz) is that if you separate performance from result, as SQL does, then you have to think about performance differently.  In <i>theory</i> you code for results first and then tune performance later.  In <i>practice,</i> this only gets you so far and you need to code with some knowledge of performance limitations.

I just notice that other people said that MIT <i>could</i> have put an immediate stop to the proceedings:<p>&quot;Here are the facts: This report claims that MIT was neutral  but MITs lawyers gave prosecutors total access to witnesses and evidence, while refusing access to Aarons lawyers to the exact same witnesses and evidence. Thats not neutral. The fact is that all MIT had to do was say publicly, We dont want this prosecution to go forward  and Steve Heymann and Carmen Ortiz would have had no case. We have an institution to contrast MIT with  JSTOR, who came out immediately and publicly against the prosecution. Aaron would be alive today if MIT had acted as JSTOR did. MIT had a moral imperative to do so.&quot;<p>(from <a href=""http://tarensk.tumblr.com/post/56881327662/mit-report-is-a-whitewash-my-statement-in-response"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tarensk.tumblr.com/post/56881327662/mit-report-is-a-w...</a>)",1375235970

6131430,comment,6129148,6131204,3,0,ericHosick,,,"As some people have mentioned in this HN post, it is hard to define what programming means.<p>A program is the result of the automation of some process (system) that people have thought up (even things that couldn&#x27;t exist before computers). Programming is the act of taking that process (system) and describing it in a computing device of some kind.<p>Programming currently requires some kind of mapping from the &quot;real world&quot; to the &quot;computer world&quot;. The current mapping is done primarily with source code. So, it currently seems that people who are good at programming are good at mapping from the &quot;real world&quot; into the &quot;computer world&quot; via coding.<p>You seem to be making the point that some people are just good at programming because they can do things like &quot;re-discover the bubble sort algorithm&quot; or understand CAP theorem. These are very domain specific problems.<p>For people who are able to &quot;re-discover inventory control management&quot; they would do a great job of automating it (programming) if they had an easier way to map that process (system) to a computing device.<p>The ultimate goal (other than maybe AI) is a 1-to-1 mapping between a &quot;real world&quot; process (system) and a computing device that automates it.",1375235926

In addition, the author writes about his own fairly significant fasts.<p><a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/95722979/Starving-Your-Way-to-Vigor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/95722979/Starving-Your-Way-to-Vigo...</a><p>After reading that article and doing a little bit of further research online, I tried a pair of fasts. The first was a week, followed a few months later by one of 10 days. My experience was very similar to what the author describes. That is, I felt good during the fast after the miserable 2nd day. Coming off the fast was no problem, either. Food was actually not a significant temptation during the fast and I found the discipline aspect to be much easier than the couple of standard diets I&#x27;ve ever tried.<p>I&#x27;m tall and about 50 pounds overweight (~200 lbs would be my target weight). In the 10 day fast I lost roughly a pound per day, but for me the weight came back within just a few weeks. I suspect that to have the best results I&#x27;d have to continue my fast for 5-6 weeks.<p>In fact, I only broke my fast because I was leaving for a road trip vacation in which I had to drive. My focus was actually fine and I was able to write software with no problems during my fast, but wasn&#x27;t willing to experiment with long stretches of driving.<p>I&#x27;m actually looking forward to my next fast which I hope I can make last at least several weeks.",1375235789

6131413,comment,6129148,6130889,3,0,slacka,,,"> We&#x27;ve been doing concurrency for many years now; it&#x27;s called pthreads.<p>Sometimes, the major advances come when fresh ideas are infused from the outside. In Darwin&#x27;s case it was his geological work that inspired his theory. In concurrency maybe it will be ideas from neuroscience.<p>> No radically different solution to concurrency is magically going to appear tomorrow: programmers _need_ to understand concurrency, and work with existing systems.<p>The environment is changing. In 2007, the oxygen levels started increasing, single threaded CPU scaling hit the wall. It has gone from doubling every 2 years to a few % increases per year.<p>We are only at the beginning of this paradigm shift to massively multi-core CPUs. Both the tools and the theory are still in their infancy. In HW there are many promising advances being explored, such as GPUs, Intel Phi, new FPGAs, and projects like Parallella.<p>The software side also requires new tools to drive these new technologies. Maybe a radical new idea, but more likely some evolved form of CSP, functional, flow-Based, and/or reactive programming models from the 70s, that didn&#x27;t work with the HW environment at the time will fill this new niche.<p>For example, one of the smartest guys I know working on a neuromorphic engineering where he&#x27;s creating a ASIC with thousand of cores now and may evolve to (b)millions. If this trilobite emerges on top, whatever language is used to program it might have been terrible in the 70s or for your &quot;existing systems&quot; but it may be the future of programming.",1375235750

It is the most efficient for the monopolist. Think of it as a local maximum.

One isn&#x27;t prepared with drones appearing from nowhere and watching your home, you know. Imagine you see a car approaching you fast, everyone seeing you would think &quot;jump or run to the side, now&quot;, but when it happens to yourself in a moment you weren&#x27;t ready, then you just freeze.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen it first, but felt the vibration and after touching the window for about 10seconds I was sure that this wasn&#x27;t my neighbours music or something else. It was weird because I didn&#x27;t hear such deep sound before, it wasn&#x27;t very loud, but had a very low frequency, I guess that&#x27;s why the window vibrated so strong. One could feel the pressure or tingling on the skin.<p>Then it came into eyesight, I don&#x27;t know if it switched that red triangle shaped thing on, or if I saw it after starting to look for something that could make such strong vibrations. Everybody would look for a car parking there with loud music,  so did I. But I didn&#x27;t see it, so I looked up.\nThe thing I focused my eyes on first was to see, if there is some movement below it, like rockets, lights or anything, I was really afraid of what would happen next. I couldn&#x27;t run away, it was just there. After starting to realize the situation that I was in, I hid at the side of that small room, but could still see how it stood there in the air. After some time, it flew higher and increased it&#x27;s speed, without the red triangle shaped thing in sight, it was hard to make out. The first thing I did, was to call mum and ask, if she&#x27;s ok.<p>Summing it up: It had some kind of engine that allowed it to stand still in the air and move to different directions, it was gray or dark, not sure. The engine wasn&#x27;t loud enough to get aware of it from a distance, but when &quot;near&quot; you could feel very strong vibrations. It could accelerate pretty fast. It had no flashing lights, but it looked like there was something moving below it, I couldn&#x27;&#x27;t make out what it was. I don&#x27;t remember the shape good enough, sorry.

We expect that as a base and small deviations from it, especially favorable ones. But anything else has to be tied to very rational reasoning about why the discrimmination is happening.<p>So we can say insurance for women vs men is generally OK because it is two large groups and the discrimmination is tied to real justifiable costs in the difference of insuring them. We can say students vs others is OK because everybody has the experience of and choice to be a student. Similarly with seniors - we will all get to be seniors one day, with luck :-) So you&#x27;re not discrimminating between people - everyone will get to experience these benefits at some stage.<p>The geographical segmentation is difficult because (just like race), it&#x27;s something beyond our control - we can&#x27;t help where we live, and it will never change. Suffering a selective negative consequence for something that is beyond your control violates our basic sense of right and wrong about human equality.<p>The time honored way to segment a customer base is to offer tiers of product. Identify a few special features and sprinkle them into a &quot;professional&quot; version. Then sell that for a higher price. If Australians on average are more affluent, more of them will buy the higher priced version, and you will still be making (some of) your extra money.

IMO this is one of the most important concepts in computing, but too few people are explicitly aware of it.  Unfortunately he didn&#x27;t mention it.<p>Really what Victor is complaining about is the web.  He doesn&#x27;t like the fact that we are hand-coding HTML and CSS in vim instead of directly manipulating spatial objects.  (Although HTML is certainly declarative.  Browsers actually do separate intent from device-specific details.  We are not writing Win32 API calls to draw stuff, though he didn&#x27;t acknowledge that.)<p>It has been impressed on me a lot lately how much the web is simply a distributed Unix.  It&#x27;s built on a file-system-like addressing scheme.  Everything is a stream of bytes (with some additional HTTP header metadata).  There are bunch of orthogonal domain-specific languages (HTML/CSS/etc vs troff/sed/etc).  They both have a certain messiness, but that&#x27;s necessary and not accidental.<p>This design is not accidental.  It was taken from Unix and renamed &quot;REST&quot;.   The Unix/Plan 9/REST principle is essentially the same as the Alan Perlis quote: &quot;It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.&quot; [1]  The single data structure is the stream of bytes, or the file / file descriptor.<p>For the source code example, how would you write a language-independent grep if every language had its own representation?  How about diff?  hg or git?  merge tools?  A tool to jump to source location from compiler output?  It takes multiple languages to solve any non-trivial problem, so you will end up with an M x N combinatorial explosion (N tools for each of M languages), whereas you want M + N (M languages + N tools that operate on ALL languages).<p>Most good programming languages have the same flavor -- they are built around a single data structure.  In C, this is the pointer + offset (structs, arrays).  In Python/Lua it&#x27;s the dictionary.  In R it&#x27;s the data frame; in Matlab it&#x27;s the matrix.  In Lisp/Scheme it&#x27;s the list.<p>Java and C++ tend to have exploding codebase size because of the proliferation of types, which cause the M * N explosion.  Rich Hickey has some good things to say about this.<p>I would posit that Windows and certain other software ecosystems have reached a fundamental scaling limit because of the O(M*N) explosion.  Even if you have $100 billion, you can&#x27;t write enough code to cover this space.<p>Another part of this is the dichotomy between visually-oriented people and language-oriented people.  A great read on this schism is: <a href=""http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html</a> .  IMO language-oriented tools compose better and abstract better than visual tools.  In this thread, there is a great point that code is not 2D or 3D; it has richer structure than can really be represented that way.<p>I really like Bret Victor&#x27;s talks and ideas.  His other talks are actually proposing solutions, and they are astounding.  But this one comes off more as complaining, without any real solutions.<p>He completely misunderstands the reason for the current state of affairs.  It&#x27;s NOT because we are ignorant of history.  It&#x27;s because language-oriented abstractions scale better and let programmers get things done more quickly.<p>That&#x27;s not to say this won&#x27;t change, so I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s working on it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html</a>",1375234855

You essentially need some sort of scheduler to give various threads access to the shm via cas primitives.<p>Let&#x27;s take up the second point first: you have implemented tasks that communicate using pipes without sharing memory (rt/rust_task.cpp). You&#x27;ve exposed the lower-level rt/sync via libextra/sync.rs, but it&#x27;s frankly not a big improvement over using raw pthreads.  The scheduler is a toy (rt/rust_scheduler.cpp), and the memory allocator is horribly primitive (rt/memory_region.cpp; did I read correctly? are you using an array to keep track of the allocated regions?). The runtime is completely devoid of any garbage collection, because you started out with the premise that manual memory management is the way to go: did it occur to you that a good gc would have simplified the rest of your runtime greatly?<p>Now for the first point: Rust really has no way of accomplishing it, because you I don&#x27;t get access to free(). The best you can do at this point is to use some sort of primitive reference counter (not much unlike cpython or shared-pointer in C++), because it&#x27;s too late to implement a tracing garbage collector. And you just threw performance out the window by guaranteeing that you will call free() everytime something goes out of scope, no matter how tiny the memory.<p>Now, let&#x27;s compare it to the go runtime: arena-allocator tracked using bitmaps (malloc.goc), decent scheduler (proc.c), decent tracing garbage collector (mgc0.c), and channels (chan.c). For goroutines modifying shared state, they even implemented a nice race-detection tool (race.c).<p>The fact of the matter is that a good runtime implementing &quot;pretty&quot; concurrency primitives requires a garbage collector internally anyway.  It&#x27;s true that go doesn&#x27;t give me a free() either, but atleast I&#x27;m reassured by the decent gc.<p>Now, having read through most of libstd, observe:<p><pre><code>  impl<&#x27;self, T> Iterator<&&#x27;self [T]> for RSplitIterator<&#x27;self, T>\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s the big deal here?  The lifetime of the variable is named (&#x27;self), and the ownership semantics are clear (& implies borrowed pointer; not very different from the C++ counterpart). Whom is all this benefitting? Sure, you get annoying compile-time errors when you don&#x27;t abide by these rules, but what is the <i>benefit</i> of using them if there&#x27;s no tooling around it (aka. gc)? Yes, it&#x27;s trivially memory-safe and I get that.<p>Lastly think about why people use C and C++. Primarily, it boils down to compiler strength. The rust runtime doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s getting there; atleast not in its current shape.",1375234746

And that&#x27;s absolutely a product management failure, not a marketing failure.

That last point was inexcusable, a product management fuck up of Apple Maps proportions. The whole point of Surface RT was Office, and every review of the device said &quot;Office RT is slow and buggy.&quot; The overwhelming feeling with Surface RT is that &quot;I&#x27;m really going to be kicking myself in 6 months when they release the next version with flagship specs to match the flagship price.&quot;<p>Re: Surface Pro, Microsoft launched at a Macbook Air 11&quot; price point, without the Air&#x27;s great keyboard and with substantially weaker battery life (in Engadget&#x27;s test, half the battery life of the comparably-sized Acer W700). The overwhelming feeling with Surface Pro was &quot;I&#x27;m really going to be kicking myself when they release the next iteration with Haswell and usable battery life.&quot;<p>On top of all that, the segmentation was arbitrary and capricious.

How much market share has it captured?<p>Another difference: the ecosystems of iOS and Android dwarf that of the games market, making playing catch up much harder (when will Nokia catch up to Samsung?)<p>Can MS become a viable tablet option?

6131204,comment,6129148,6130993,2,0,astrobe_,,,"The difference between setting parameters and programming is obviously that programming allows the creation of new functions.\n&quot;Coding&quot; is literally the act of translating a more-or-less formally specified program (that is, a set of planned actions) into a particular computer language.\nHowever, if being a programmer was only like being a translator, programming wouldn&#x27;t be too hard for mere mortals. That&#x27;s on the other part - the one that involves methods, logic, knowledge like the CAP theorem - they have problems with. The fact is, not every one can re-discover the bubble sort algorithm like we all here did when we were 8 or so. That&#x27;s why we are programmers, and that&#x27;s why they are not (and don&#x27;t even want to be -- but they are nonetheless nice people and have other qualities, like having money). And these problems don&#x27;t vanish if you switch from control-flow to data-flow or some bastardized-flow; they just change shape.",1375232664

6131202,comment,6115727,6120970,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"I&#x27;m wondering if we&#x27;re talking about different things here. You&#x27;re talking about vectors, which to me suggests an ordered collection of primitives. I&#x27;m talking about sets of relations.<p>The main difference is that a relation is not a primitive. It is a tuple of primitives.<p>The point being that sometimes you care about those relations being ordered by date, sometimes by amount, sometimes by ID and so on and so forth. The database imposes no order on you and so you can impose one at will.<p>The database equivalent of maintaining order for every single-column selection is to have per-column indices.<p>Try that in production on a busy OLTP system and let me know how you go.<p>Where array/vector languages and SQL see eye-to-eye is in basically abolishing the loop and having a logical model where operations are applied simultaneously to whole collections.<p>From talking to you the difference is when order is imposed. In cases of time series analysis, where there are single numbers and a natural order, I see the value of array/vector languages (or one of the various proprietary temporal-SQL databases). But most problems of interest aren&#x27;t vectors with a single natural order.<p>Incidentally, I don&#x27;t see why you think the tax-bracket thing is such a killer case. Oh noes, a small join!",1375232653

If the prepwork doesn&#x27;t include git, learn git (Recommend CodeSchool, GitHub&#x27;s tutorial, and generally spending time using git). Reading Pro Git or something like that doesn&#x27;t really help unless you&#x27;ve been using git for a while. Learn how to use GitHub (fork, cloning, pull requests, issues, etc). Build a good internal mental model for what is going on.<p>3. Get in the habit of <i>properly</i> touch-typing if you don&#x27;t already (meaning all ten fingers and using the pinky). You&#x27;d be surprised how even a lot of programmers don&#x27;t properly touch type. Get comfortable with a standard text editor (I recommend Sublime Text for a beginner. You can learn vim later, maybe after the course).<p>4. If the course curriculum does not include <i>basic</i> data structures and algorithms, get a good overview of basic data structures and algorithms. Meaning learn about hashes, arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, binary search trees and how to implement them. Learn about order of growth, etc. If the course does cover those topics, then you can go ahead and hold off on learning them (or not). You <i>can</i> read about these topics, but I think getting it explained to you by a teacher, assuming those topics are covered in the course, is a lot easier and intuitive.<p>5. Some courses don&#x27;t go into much depth about HTML and CSS (for good reason - those topics are just pure memorization, lots of busywork and trial and error, not very much educational value). If so, brush up on HTML and CSS, especially advanced CSS. A lot of web dev interviews will (sadly) involve those two areas.<p>6. Code as much as possible. Jump ahead. Read as much as possible.  If it&#x27;s a Rails school, take the initiative to go through the Hartl tutorial, learn/read/code about advanced Ruby metaprogramming. Ditto if you&#x27;re doing JS or Python.<p>7. Start a personal website and blog. Make it look good (this can be your practice for #5). This is not important for success in the course, but is important for branding yourself after the course. By the way, I personally believe you should avoid branding yourself as a &quot;junior&quot; developer. Avoid that.",1375232605

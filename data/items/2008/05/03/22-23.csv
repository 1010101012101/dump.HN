180480,comment,180311,180472,0,0,DenisM,,,"The idea is that there is enough chaos in the Internet to produce practically random result with sufficiently large number of users.\nRandom is pretty good, unless you must proactively shift load to least-loaded systems (in which case you have to be super careful to avoid oscillations) .<p>One drawback is that you can't take system out of rotation as quickly, but this can be somewhat mitigated by setting very low TTL (60 seconds).",1209855325

I shop online at Peapod for groceries, and I'm scanning some docs to email to my accountant, so the ""mail-slot"" is about right too. Although, looks like they're predicting this for 1989, so they were a little optimistic. The funny thing is that this seemed wild and futuristic then, and now it's just mundane.<p>I try and maintain my sense of wonder...",1209854943
180477,comment,180311,180311,0,0,brianr,,,"I'm using nginx in a couple different setups:<p><pre><code>  nginx -> paste (pylons)</code></pre>\nnginx on one machine, three other machines with 8 instances of paste each. Nginx proxies directly to the paste port (which incidentally is also itself a threaded server, but I've gotten best results by running several instance per box). Volume has been as high as ~8mm dynamic requests/day.<p><pre><code>  nginx -> lighttpd -> php-fcgi</code></pre>\nnginx on its own box proxying to 8 app servers each running 160 php-fcgi instances. Volume here is ~16mm dynamic requests/day.<p>Both have worked pretty well so far. As anortherjesse said, there's not a lot of feedback, but it's done everything I need so far.",1209854774

Web 2.0 and/or cloud computing is not about the old ""thin client"" idea, in fact, it's more like the opposite (with ""fat"" clients being part of the cloud).<p>The writer is just trying to re-hash a very old debate nobody is having anymore.

For example, the load on your servers would be determined by the caching behaviors of all the various DNS servers and clients out there. I think this scheme should only be used as a front line that leads to another layer of load balancers.",1209854237

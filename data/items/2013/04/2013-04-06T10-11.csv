5503240,comment,5501425,5501425,1,0,mprinz,,,"I was not a Sierra adventure fan (except Gabriel Knight), but I loved EVERY ONE of the Lucasfilm Games. Why? I think they managed perfection in these four areas:<p>ACCESS, FUN, CHARACTERS, DESIGN<p>ACCESS:
You fired up the game and could immediately start playing. Most of the games had no or very short intros or cutscenes. Lucasfilm was very strong at telling the story throughout the game. ""I'm Guybrush Threepwood and I wanna be a pirate"" -> There you go!<p>Controls were also very easy, I think they were even the first games that you could play through by only using your mouse. That's important, because you could just literally lean back and play.<p>FUN
Maybe it's just me (obviously not) but Gilbert's and Schafer's writing style, that's my idea of fun! Well written, perfectly executed and timed. Often with very few or no words at all. Sometimes Bernard or Guybrush just turned to you and said nothingall said!<p>CHARACTERS
The teams put a lot of effort in creating unique characters. Why the hell do I know names like Guybrush, Elaine, Stan, Bernard, Hoagie, Laverne, Ben, Bobbin, Manny, Glottis; but I can hardly remember any other adventure game character names.
It's because I was emotionally bounded with them. They were mostly struggling with their environment but managed their obstacles often with unorthodox methods.<p>DESIGN
Especially Ron Gilbert and Hal Barwood established adventure game design that is still considered standard today. Brought to fame by Ron's article ""Why adventure games suck  And what we can do about it"" (<a href=""http://grumpygamer.com/2152210"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grumpygamer.com/2152210</a>).

5503208,comment,5500095,5501619,5,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>The same overselling that happened with Java is happening again, don't worry, a magical JIT is right around the corner that will come within spitting distance of native C</i><p>For many purposes the JVM achieved the goals you mention. Humans have an infinite capacity for hand-made optimizations, which is why it's pretty hard for a virtual machine or a compiler to beat hand-written assembly by a developer that knows his shit, but it takes a herculean effort to build big, long running, highly concurrent apps in C/C++ and it takes companies with the resources of Google or Mozilla to do it.<p>For instance Mozilla is still struggling with memory leaks in Firefox. Why is that? Because memory gets fragmented due to improper allocation patterns, not to mention hard to prevent memory leaks due to cyclic references. And to get around that without a generational garbage collector, you have to use object pools and manage allocations to a really fine level of detail. Or you have to make your app use multiple processes and simply not care much about it, like Google did in Chrome with their one process per tab model, which is why Chrome chokes on multiple long-running tabs opened.<p>With a precise generational garbage collector for instance, problems of fragmentation and memory leaks due to cyclic references simply go away. People complain about the latency of JVM's CMS garbage collector, but after seeing it in action in a web app that is able to serve 10000 requests per second per server in under 10ms per request, I'm actually quite impressed. It gets problematic when you've got a huge heap though, because from time to time CMS still has to do stop-the-world sweeps and with big heap sizes the process can block for entire seconds. However CMS is actually old generation and there's also the new G1 from JDK7 that should be fully non-blocking when it matures and if you need a solution that works right now you can shell out the cash for Azul's pauseless garbage collector.<p>It's really hard to build a precise generational garbage collector on top of a language that allows manual memory allocation. Mono's new garbage collector for instance is not precise for stack-allocated values. Go's garbage collector is a simple parallel mark-and-sweep that's conservative, non-precise and non-generational. The most common complain you'll hear about Go from people that actually used it is about its garbage collector, a problem that will simply not go away because Go is too low-level.<p>And I'm really happy about Mozilla improving Firefox. Firefox is my browser, but how many years did it take for them to solve the memory issues that Firefox had?<p>Yes, you probably couldn't build a reasonably efficient browser on top of the JVM right now, especially since browsers also have to run on top of devices that are less efficient, but most developers can't build browsers anyway. And in a couple of years from now, mark my words, security will be considered much more important than performance and suddenly the usage of languages in which buffer overflows are a fact of life will be unacceptable.<p>Also in regards to big iron, I chose Cassandra (a Java app) instead of MongoDB (a C++ app that's the darling of the NoSQL crowd). I did that because Cassandra scales better horizontally and because performance degrades less on massive inserts. Apparently low-level optimizations can't beat architectures more tuned to the problems you're having, go figure.",1365244497

The Intel solutions are stable, heat up a lot less and get the job done, in case you are not into some serious graphics processing.
The wireless card may be another issue, Broadcom support has recently been built in into the kernel, but out of box support is still not there(you need to download the firmware, which is proprietary). Rather, go for an Atheros card, which has much better support.
The rest of the hardware should not be an issue.
Had experience with a lot of machines, including Dell, Acer, HP, Asus, MacBooks as well. Have found the systems with Intel graphics to be most stable and usable. One particular system you may want to look into is Dell Vostro, though am not sure of the Wireless Card in it.",1365244319

5503172,comment,5501425,5503137,1,0,PetitPrince,,,"While not a point and click, Psychonauts is widely considered to be a worthy successor of the golden age Lucasarts craziness. Let's have a look at the synopsys: a runaway circus boy goes to a summer camp for psychics lead by a international team of superspy. He discovers that a mad dentist is stealing everyone's brain by making them sneeze, and in order to get him he has to travel into the mind of several deranged persons. Certainly on par with the purple tentacle trying to take over the world or the deathly travel agent, if you ask me :) .<p>Also, while not being a point-and-click game stricto sensu, you should really have a try at Stacking. It maybe not as brilliantly written as Psychonauts, it has some pacing issue but it's a really charming adventure (with Matryoshka dolls !) from the start to the end !",1365243319

I would do the same thing. In my case, OkCupid is a product I've tried and I am entitled to my own opinions about it, even if they are negative. What we're doing isn't complimentary in the same way. I know they don't want to help us out because I've done enough research on IAC to understand it's not in their corporate DNA to want to work with their competitors. Their mission is to buy or shut competitors down.<p>Some early stage startup founders genuinely want to help other founders out because they're both in the same boat. In this case, I'm referring specifically to a media mogul who has an agenda of keeping competitors out of his space. He fears the Internet because it is a way to bypass middlemen. He knows that artists may eventually go out and promote themselves, but he wants them to be perpetually stuck on Ticketmaster. He doesn't care about innovating, he's only out for the money.<p><i>It would be insane not to talk with these people just on the fear of wasting half an hour because you don't want to be acquired.</i><p>I'm giving up half of my day to meet with anyone in SF.

5503170,comment,5501425,5501425,1,0,b0rsuk,,,"Here's a provocative thought:
RPG games have boomed because they're the descendants of point&click adventure games. I'd like to have the name ""cRPG"" changed to ""Adventure"". It describes much better what the game is about, the majority of players doesn't care about role playing, and many cRPG games don't even support that. Diablo is often called Action RPG for some reason despite not offering a choice at all, the story always unfolds in exactly the same way.<p>Anyway, old point&click games were usually about a story. Now cRPG games are the vessel for that. Exploration is also crucial to both genres, I know of no cRPG game which takes place in the same area, where variety comes from changes, events, new people arriving rather than unlocking new zones. Baldur's Gate 2 and Planescape: Torment are a good example of what I'm talking about - both have big cities, but what you're really doing is getting access to new areas within them.",1365243294

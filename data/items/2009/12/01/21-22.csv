The amount of effort something takes almost always decreases.<p>> The time spent is a small price to pay for total security against remote theft. At the very least, those of us who are not terminally lazy ought to have the option of paying it.<p>How does this system provide 'total security' and guard against remote theft? There is no such thing as 'total security,' you're just mitigating risk. From the way it sounded, you punch in the amount at the time of physical swipe. Once you try to buy something online, you're outside the scope of your physical card.<p>I do agree however that you should be able to opt in for services that require more verification for transferring money. If you want to spend $25 to get an RSA token to provide a code every time you purchase something, I don't see anything wrong with that service being offered to you.<p>> Ever have your credit or bank card stolen? Thieves typically split their theft into numerous small transactions.<p>No, I guess I personally did not. As far as the information I read about and had limited contact when I was associated with a security lab, carders distribute cc numbers in the thousands and resell them, and eventually do get charged in small amounts. Again, I don't see how a two-factor system would prevent this. But also admittedly, I've never spent any amount of time thinking about it nor did I personally research into this.",1259704470

Most people would say no - but yet it's the simplest, easiest to calculate, and least burdensome in terms of processing cost (both for the filer and the taxman).

970835,comment,969952,970478,0,0,Dove,,,"It is not being metaphysical in nature that makes Pascal's Wager nonsense.  It is that it demands action without sufficient rational foundation.<p>The rational reaction to a possible crisis in which one lacks information is not to jump immediately away from what looks like the scariest outcome.  That tends to make things worse.  The right reaction is to focus on research until a decision absolutely cannot be avoided--and even then, make the minimum decision the evidence warrants.<p>I view that as the case here.  If the evidence is sufficient to convince and act on, okay.  Act on it.  But if it is not, the stakes being high do not change anything.  By all accounts, there's time yet to be more certain, so let's take the time and be more certain.<p>Incidentally, ""a lot of reputable scientists are concerned"" is a statement about state of the evidence, and not a very persuasive one to me.  I know a thing or two about simulating complex systems; a non-predictive simulation, a theory concerning a single variable input, a loose-but-not-awesome correlation?  In a complex system, that really <i>is</i> street preacher kind of evidence.  Absolutely it warrants theoretical concern; follow that line of research.  But as a call to action?  Nah.

A worker's exposure to mercury vapor shall at no time exceed this ceiling level.</i><p><i>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has established a recommended exposure limit (REL) for mercury vapor of 0.05 mg/m(3) as a TWA for up to a 10-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek.</i><p>Now all we need to know is that a 12 foot by 12 foot by 8 foot bedroom is about 4 by 4 by 2.5 meters, which adds up to about 40 cubic meters. Break a mercury bulb in that room, disperse 100% of the mercury in the bulb throughout the room, assume the room is leakproof, and stay in the room breathing deeply for several minutes after the bulb breaks and you'll get exposed to 0.125 mg/m(3). This is about twice as high as the maximum amount that you should be breathing for 10 hours per day, 40 hours per week. But it is barely above the maximum legal exposure limit for workers.<p>Now consider that your bedroom isn't airtight -- assuming your house is either properly ventilated or improperly insulated. ;) Not only will the mercury distribute itself through the house, but it will then leave the house, within a matter of an hour. Also, not all of the mercury is likely to leak; some of it will condense in the bulb. And all of this will only happen once per bulb failure.<p>Conclusion: I'd find something more important to worry about. You probably don't have to look very far, because this risk is pretty low. If you just can't stop worrying without taking action, turn on a fan and open the windows for five minutes every time a bulb burns out. You'll still save plenty of energy.<p>Second-order conclusion: Take a class on solving Fermi problems. ;)",1259703939

Similar to the author's observation, my own experience is that consumer patterns have changed dramatically in recent years and a new generation of entrepreneurs is now at the best and unique vantage point to visualize what their peers need and want. So this is not about solutions looking for problems or problems looking for solutions. It is about creators of solutions being also the consumers of solutions (""entre-sumers"").

OTOH, if you write a parser on your own, you're likely to miss stuff like section 4.2, which explains that header values can be multiline if they include LWS. The parser from this article will fail on (just looking at the source, I'm 99.5% sure of this):<p><pre><code>    abc:\n     def\n</code></pre>\nIt also doesn't like tabs and will not support comma-separated header values. It's not rocket science to write a ""good enough"" http parser, but writing a fully compliant one is something completely different. There are also cool parts of the spec that you can read 10 times and come to different conclusions - for example what does the ""\" CR LF section mean if it's inside a quoted string and does it finish the header value or not. Writing a ""correct"" parser is a LOT of fun...<p>Keeping separate states for characters in HTTP saves you a couple of cycles probably, because you match as you go and can reject the message early and with the exact place that didn't match.

We have now had three incidents of bulbs spontaneously cracking open at the end of their life. Why is this a problem? Mercury exposure. I have no idea how much mercury we have inhaled since this began. We have also had some bulbs die without obvious cracking [edit: and I wonder if maybe they have leaked too, since I wasn't looking for the problem until now], but the most recent bulb to die did so while I was in the room, and I noticed it happening, so I got to see what was going on.<p>The bulb was flickering and the gas at the base of the tubes (where they enter the body of the screw-on portion) was turning orange. I decided to remove the bulb before it had a chance to break. Very shortly, in the few seconds it took me to remove the bulb, the bulb started heating up. At first it wasn't even warm to the touch, and ten seconds later it was so hot I was starting to wonder if I would get it out in time to not need a glove or cloth. At that point I turned off the power (should have done that to start with) and noticed acrid plastic-smelling smoke coming out near the base of the tubes.<p>I'm guessing some sort of plastic or epoxy/resin material is used to seal the tubes at the base, and this was melting. And the next step, had I not been there to catch and prevent it, would have been the heating of the glass to the point where it broke.<p>I'm not really super thrilled about myself or my children breathing mercury vapors repeatedly as the light bulbs in my house expire one after the other over the years.<p>Question for HN: Has anyone else seen this? Since these bulbs are supposed to last for seven years, maybe it's a hidden problem until now? I was hoping LED lights would be the solution, but they are so dim they don't really act as an adequate substitute.<p>tl;dr: Upon aging, my CF bulbs have been cracking open, presumably releasing mercury vapors into my house. With 50+ light bulbs in the house, I'm concerned about this and wonder if others see it too.",1259701470

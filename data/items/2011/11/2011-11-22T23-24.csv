One approach which would help curb corporate power would be to start removing the civil liability limits on many sectors. To use the oil industry as an example, the reason BP got off so lightly after causing damage to nearly all industries reliant on the gulf coast was that there was a $75M cap on civil damages, where without that cap, BP easily could have gone out of business after being sued under Tort law.<p>The United States in it's early days was a decent example of a near-free market functioning, as there was no central bank and minimal regulation on business.<p>Also, I'm glad to see you're interested in learning more.

Also, lots of larger plants depend on the tracking motion of the sun to grow normally.  Think about the last time you saw an indoor tree that looked like it was growing nicely: it almost certainly had a glass roof over it, because they really need that all that light to survive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pesn.com/2005/07/27/9600139_Fiber_Optics_Bring_Sun_Indoors/p2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pesn.com/2005/07/27/9600139_Fiber_Optics_Bring_Sun_In...</a>",1322005856

3267977,comment,3267428,3267628,26,0,femto,,,"It's the future, representing a convergence between Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and the microprocessor.<p>Gate arrays are vast arrays of logic gates, which can be wired together in almost arbitrary patterns by a sea of ""fuses"", typically controlled by state stored in on-board SRAM.  They are real time and blindingly fast due to their massive parallelism, achieving supercomputer type speeds when applied to the right type of problem and programmed well.  They are more difficult to program than a microprocessor.  One way of looking at an FPGA is as an array of tens of millions of very simple computing engines.<p>Over the years, the number of transistors on an FPGA has been rocketing up.  Generally these transistors have been put to use by providing more and more simple logic blocks.  We are now to the point where we have almost more gates than we know what to do with, and the chip is being dominated by interconnects.  This has seen a move towards including a limited number of elaborate hard wired blocks, such as CPUs and multipliers, in addition to the array of logic.<p>The logical evolution is to stop providing more blocks, but make each block more complex as transistor counts go up.  Eventually we will see arrays of tens of millions of microprocessors, rather than tens of millions of logic blocks.  There will be no distinction between a multicore CPU and FPGA.<p>It's worth noting that the first Xilinx FPGAs, thirty years ago, provided arrays of around 144 logic blocks, similar to the processor count in this chip.  Extrapolate 30 years and we will have an array of 10 million microprocessors.",1322005310

Have a complex catalog structure with a few million SKUs, add in a few tens of millions each of users, orders, coupons, and push thousands of orders an hour, and you have a LOT of DB traffic.  Add in things like real time inventory checks on product pages, dynamic shipping option/cost calculations based on the user's address (if logged in) or IP address (if not logged in), determining applicable coupons, cross-sell, up-sell, CTAs, dynamically based on the user's history and profile data, etc...  You make a lot of db calls.  Even caching stuff on the app tier you have to load that stuff in from the db at least once, etc...  Again this is all dependent on your application and needs, but saying you should rewrite it to move more logic into the DB isn't really useful in many scenarios.<p>If you need things like dynamic cloud scaling, read only slave replication, etc... chances are you're doing a lot of DB transactions as well, and that latency can and will kill you.",1322004562

3267916,comment,3264102,3264102,4,0,c52Andy,,,"After posting this last night, I've been positively (literally) overwhelmed by the feedback both on and off HN. Discretion on some 'harsher' emails definitely appreciated :)<p>I wanted to revisit and expand on the original topic. I'd posted literally to ask the question hypothetically (no ulterior) of whether the scenario sounded equitable - not to actually try and source talent or 'fish.' That's one reason I was being vague on description... didn't see the need to go into it.<p>I now see the error of my ways. This is a community for hackers and while we are ""idea people"" on one level (not hackers), we're not just that... we're also (perhaps) misguided enthusiastic idiots who've also grown a couple profitable businesses along the way... ""lifehackers"" if you will (problem: earn money, feed family. solution: whatever it takes).<p>Since there's been a recurring ""what's it about"" thread I'll expand on this. Firstly, we have someone on board to start protoyping based on my designs; he plans to do so in Rails using an existing framework he's built. He's not in our basement. We're planning to pay him for that service, and are working with him on another job (not the start-up). In other words the post wasn't a 'hacker wanted' plea, but more of a ""would it seem out of line"" as we consider the prospects of how we could move from payment toward a push (on limited cash) to get something released in exchange for some kind of equity. A potential perk to building a team on limited resources.<p>One reason we need to consider it is that this guy, like every talented hacker on this board, has other irons in the fire and a career of his own to manage. So start-up may not be his bag, baby.<p>Who's bag might it be? Tough to say, but a lot of the feedback has been 'get personal already'. So, my name is Andy Johnson, and my wife is Michelle Blaine and we have a start-up company called Chef 52, Inc. Here's a bit about it from the late YC application we submitted if you're interested. It ought to give you the basic overview of the business, name our <i>potential</i> partners (disclaimer: nothing signed in blood yet) and give you a view of both our living room, and 'us' as people.<p><a href=""http://chef52.posterous.com/chef-52-described-for-ycombinator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chef52.posterous.com/chef-52-described-for-ycombinato...</a><p>Don't let the bad hair and casual dress fool you. We bring a lot more to the table than an idea. We have 8 kids (yes, 8) that are alive, healthy and prospering in this world. Food was a critical component to that equation, and we're both passionate 'foodies'. Michelle is a stellar cook and has spent years working in the food industry; initially to support her habit spending years working in the film/TV industry - which she did so very successfully. She's also worked in music licensing and managed to build real value and equity for clients. She's a shrewd business woman, and a loving mother (more of the latter seen on video).<p>I was a touring musician 'in a past life' and have been passionate about food and cooking since I was a teenager. First because my Dad was an excellent cook so I grew up thinking a man's place WAS in the kitchen. Then in my early 20s as a necessity because my health went down the tubes... rock'n'roll lifestyle perhaps or luck of the draw. But either way, I used food and nutrition as the singular means to regain my health and well-being. Successfully! It was a total trip and changed my lifestyle forever. As a result I've been a vege/pescetarian coming up on about 19 years now.<p>About 11 years ago, having taught myself several 'creative' software apps and blagged my way into some print-production gigs, I took a job at one of the largest branding agencies in the world, Landor Associates. I spent 4 years forming the foundation to become an expert in digital production as it pertains to brand... This mostly meant font management and consultation, building logo suites for global brands based on initial designs, extending design into brand guidelines and stationery/presentation 'packages' including print mechanicals and digital equivalents (Word/PPT templates), creating interactive PDFs, and very rarely getting to do a little hand coding on HTML 'comps' for clients.<p>Since leaving Landor I've managed a freelance career as a designer/producer, continued to tour as a musician, wrote a few short film scores, had another baby, moved our family back to Maui (we've been in/out of the islands all our lives), skirted death in a motorcycle accident (and 'mostly' walked away), and hacked together a number of websites with Michelle as a passionate pursuit - sometimes for money... maybe even more than we should've been paid (see ""shrewd business woman"").<p>Since leaving film/TV and music licensing, Michelle has continued to raise our family, helped me grow my freelance business into what has become Johnson Beesley (we're a branding agency compiled of free-agents working cooperatively), built a mom-blog following and become a writer for food-buzz (which incidentally came on the heels of her deciding to write about food exclusively). She's also developed a modest following on twitter (@mControl); far more than I have (@johnsonbeesley).<p>We're friendly, astute, and staunchly creative people. We follow our hearts wherever they take us and let our brains catch up. We love people that surprise us with their kindness and intelligence and often loathe people that fail to surprise us by reaffirming our occasional desire to join what Bill Hicks coined as the ""people who hate people club.""<p>Our project, Chef 52, aims to be a culmination of our collective life experience. It represents something we know a lot about - people, friends, family, food, health and self employment.<p>The latter two are critical to our vision. We believe there's a behavioral change opportunity in this idea that would help people get 'out of the drive thru and back to the table.' We've watched childhood and adult obesity, diabetes, heart disease and all sorts of other nutritional fails claim people's lives. Some who were loved ones. So, we now have an idea that if effectively produced could put a dent in our declining eating habits as a culture (yes, we're doing market research on that too). The self-employment part is obvious. We've been 'without boss' and also location-independent as a result for close to 8 years now. We appreciate the freedom while never forgetting that we've actually been at that ""oh crap we've got $7 to our name"" point - with kids to feed, clothe and house. But we choose that lifestyle because we believe it's the best path in this single life we have.<p><segue> ""Single life we have"" - we're not religious people, but to call us 'spiritually motivated' would be fair. Not 'crunchy' but a bit hard around the edges. You could call me an enthusiastic aethiest and I'd say that's pretty close to accurate. </segue><p>So, that's us in a nutshell, and I felt like it was fair to post this given the personal feedback and time people have taken to express an interest in what started as hypothesis.<p>Now for some hacker comedy entertainment... Here's a collection of sites that Michelle and I have designed and/or built over the past several years... no 'web applications' but you'll get a sense of both our strengths and shortcomings in this domain. We're not clueless - but certainly not as thorough or knowledgeable as the people we'd like to help us execute the platform to deliver our vision and business:<p>www.johnsonbeesley.com (WP, not updated in ages)

It's safe to say they were crap (more so than what you may think of the above) but were a learning adventure nonetheless.<p>Thanks for reading, and if any of this makes you think ""damn, I might want to work with these people"" you can drop a line at ajohnson at johnsonbeesley and mblaine at johnsonbeesley.<p>Aloha~",1322004134

For some unfortunate reasons, I did not get sufficient vision therapy and this turned into amblyopia (lazy eye).<p>20 years later, as an adult, I had weekly vision therapy for close to 1 year (once a week). All the other patients where kids less than 10 y/o. Although it is considered very hard (or impossible) to correct amblyopia in adults (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia#Treatments"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia#Treatments</a>), my doctor was very open minded and we tried a lot of different exercises with more or less success.<p>I made some progress so the brain can learn some tricks. For example, I learned to switch my point of view from one eye to the other. I can also force my brain to see from both eyes at the same time though I then see double and the images are not aligned and the lazy eye's image is darker.<p>At the end, I stopped active therapy for two reasons. First, because I was scared that I would end up in a state where I would see double all the time and not be able to control it anymore. I know it is not very pragmatic but as talanvor said, I will not risk loosing my one good eye.

Work your way out, one component at a time.  Eventually the bigger picture comes together.  The same would probably work for this, though unless you're well versed in game and graphics programming nomenclature some of it will go over your head, which is expected - when you see something like that, think of it as an opportunity to learn a new concept and look it up.",1322003137

Both of these activities being useful to success.<p>I sometimes wonder why some people tend to feel the need to come down hard on one extreme or the other of an issue when so often in my experience the optimal path tends to be the middle road. I think it's because extremes are easier to grasp and seem more definite, more solid. But I also think this can be an indication of lazy thinking and should be called out more often.",1322003128

Now I know his real name is Chuck Testa!!!<p>On a more serious note, what we need much more of is not the processing speed. What we need much more of is what I call ""memory processability"", which roughly means ""how many times per second can you process the whole memory"" - or something like that. Basically how much CPU is there per RAM. Indexing is a great hack, but a hack it still is. Memory and processing cells must be merged into a single, massively parallel chip.",1322003042

Graceful degradation, progressive enhancement, and so on. The only exceptions have been sites specially targeted for iPads or similar cases.<p>But now, people I work with are making the claim that JavaScript can become a forced requirement for all future websites. In this world, if you're without JavaScript, you might only get a minimal, unstyled skeleton page via HTTP, so that search engines can index the URL and social sites can share it. Or even a blank page, if those things are handle by APIs.<p>The majority of the UI is then to be implemented with Backbone/Spine, Underscore templates and similar technologies. It will be fully HTML5 compliant, elegant and accessible, but it just won't work without JavaScript.<p>My question is, do you think the web is ready for this transition? Are there compelling reasons, other than just ""historical principles"", for this not to happen? Can we consider JavaScriptless users an increasingly ignoreable relic like IE6 users? Are there other key points to consider - are we throwing out some baby with the bath water?",1322002893

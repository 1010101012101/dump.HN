You are free to do what you want, but I of course will call out sexism. There are tons of resources going over the basics a simple Google search away, so there is no excuse for someone to come into this thread and brush off people who are rightly pointing out this marketing stunt as sexist.<p>> You are not our proctor.<p>True, but that doesn't mean I can't call sexism out when I see it.<p>>  You clearly subscribe to a post-structuralist/Marxist belief system and thankfully most of us do not.<p>Actually, I don't. Calling sexism out doesn't make me post-structuralist or Marxist.<p>> What you are doing is equivalent to a Evangelical Christian going into an Atheist discussion forum and telling them all they must consult the Bible to find out why they're behaving incorrectly.<p>Except I'm not telling anyone to consult my preferred religious beliefs and implying that not obeying my religion is behaving incorrectly.<p>The fact of the matter is dismissing people's criticism and experiences is simply moving the goal posts. That commenter could have easily done the bare minimum of googling to learn more, but instead they went with a brush off. I do personally behave that treating people ethically is the duty of folks who could otherwise treat people poorly, but that's just polite behavior.",1359766423

Java's greatest weakness, after all, is not the verbosity per se. If all of its other failings were addressed I would probably scarcely care about the amount of code it takes to perform a given task.<p>Likewise, compactness is not what lies behind the current FP trend. Compactness, after all, while related to programming paradigms is more directly tied to the strength and level of abstraction afforded by a given library / API. Ruby's standard library, for instance, allows for some pretty insane one liners.<p>This is to say nothing of the development time overhead involved in switching paradigms (non-trivial, IMHO). This alone offsets ""compactness"", both from the standpoint of up front dev time as well as readability / correctness, for (IMO) up to half a year.<p>As an aside, that code could be made yet more compact if written in Groovy (Groovy-as-a-Java-superset and not functional Groovy, necessarily).",1359765728

Granted, other cities (London, Vegas, Phuket, Barcelona) will have different behavioral mechanics for this sort of business, but that misses the mark altogether.<p>The main point is this: a shift in paradigm is what's needed regarding sexual health and protection. Seeing condoms as something that people will wait for (for up to 1 hour, no less) before they engage in sex is a catastrophic bag of fail.<p>The whole point of prevention is well being prepared, ahead of time, on the ready.<p>A monthly condom delivery service like Mexico's <a href=""http://rubberit.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubberit.co</a> is something I can see growing on better footing. It's sustainable in that it retains clientele through membership, it is discreet in that it allows the user to place any name as the sender, and it is also socially engaging because for every condom they sell they donate another one to rural and disadvantaged communities.<p>I mean, good luck to Durex.

I'm glad it got some reads from the community, but I'm sad it got dismissed so quickly due to flaming in the comments. This leads me to question the algorithm for flamewar detection, since it seemed like a valuable conversation.<p>I also fear Hacker News readers are mistaking ""complaining about sexism"" as an attack or complaint about males in general. I think that's why we get so many defensive, flaming comments in threads discussing gender bias. This behavior only proves how much being male is engrained into the identity and culture of the tech community. When a woman says something about the tech community, males feel their gender is being attacked and very emotional posts result.<p>I consider myself a member of the tech community working on building it, not a person attacking it, so this response was unexpected. This is a good lesson to consider when writing about gender in the future.<p>There is a lot of good work we can do together to get more women into tech, and to give women here more confidence (did you know there has been a flight of women from the industry?). As tech becomes such a vital part of every company, I feel women are missing a huge opportunity if we don't become more involved here. Women need more encouragement than men do to make a go in this industry. I think that's worth writing about.<p>So many bay area companies are doing great things to help with this cause. That's part of why I was so shocked that the online community was so dismissive of this post.<p>I have another post planned to try to inspire the tech community to get more engaged. The reason these posts keep coming up is that there is still a lot we can do to make working in this industry better (if we can agree that having more technically skilled women is something worth working toward).<p>I believe discussions about how to attract, maintain, and train developers are important to this community. I also believe there is a lot of opportunity in encouraging women to build skills and join us.<p>I ask the Hacker News admins and flaggers of my post today to please consider the value of this discussion.<p>PS: I think I will make it a point not to use ""Sexism"" in the title for future posts.

Providing my e-mail address is slow, awkward and annoying, because retail staff can't spell my name. I have no way of checking that I've actually received a receipt during the transaction, which might cost me money if I'm unable to return the goods or make a warranty claim.<p>Paper receipts aren't a meaningful environmental problem. A major British supermarket recently reduced their receipt paper consumption by half, by fitting double-sided thermal printers to all of their POS terminals. The total environmental benefit amounted to less than 300 tonnes of CO2; In a business with revenues of 21bn, that amounts to no more than a rounding error.<p>Paper receipts are very valuable to many businesses, because they can substantially reduce shrinkage. Many catering businesses have a clearly stated policy that ""If you don't get a receipt, your order is free"". This makes it far harder for employees to serve a customer and pocket the money, which was historically a very expensive problem for many businesses.<p>Most retail businesses have a lot of money invested in their POS equipment - not just the equipment itself but also the staff training and support infrastructure. Paperless receipts offer no obvious benefit to most businesses, but the costs would be substantial - replacing their POS equipment, retraining their staff and the cost of lost sales due to the inevitable teething problems of any new system.<p>I don't see why any business owner would pay you money for this. They don't see anything wrong with printed receipts - they're easy to deal with, keep their employees honest and cost them virtually nothing.",1359765439

5154442,comment,5150326,5153536,10,0,rogerbinns,,,"> Most focus on multi-user security, which still has its uses, but they fail to focus on application isolation. Applications should be installable by anyone and isolated completely from other apps unless specifically granted permission by a user/administrator.<p>Incidentally this is exactly what Android does.  They provide the isolation by creating a new user account for each app and by default apps get no permissions.  The permissions you accept at install time then allow extra access.  (Behind the scenes there are also mechanisms to provide security permissions across processes so that a second process doing work on behalf of your process is limited to your processes permissions.) Multiple problems have happened.<p>The initial default permissions in Android 1.0 were a little too permissive and for example allowed reading from the sdcard.  While that seemed harmless at the time, it was in retrospect a bad choice.<p>There is no hard validity checker.  For example if an application ignores the API call to find the location of the sdcard and instead just uses /sdcard then no one would know.  This means that it is very easy for apps to not comply with best practises to be available, the developers don't even know it, and the platform has problems if they want to fix the issues due to the large installed base.  (If Angry Birds stopped working because they hard coded things instead of using APIs would Android or Rovio get blamed?)<p>Android also made a decision that you either accept an app and its permissions, or not install it.  There are good arguments both ways of only allowing them as a whole or being able to disable some permissions. But the net effect is that many apps have more permissions than they do use, and have to declare them if there is any chance they could be used.  Users can choose to not install apps with too many permissions, but you can't leave a review explaining that.  I see a lot more pushback over permissions in app store reviews these days, but the many years of prior practise mean far too many apps have too many permissions.  (BlackBerry had this scheme where for each permission you could set it to grant, deny or ask on each use.  For the tech crowd it is great, but for someone who just wants to play a game it is annoying and probably not helpful.)<p>The permissions themselves are not sufficiently granular - for example ""Internet"" is on or off.  An email app contacting my email server is great, but contacting a command and control server in another country is a huge problem.  Of course some sort of per connection prompting could happen, but isn't really practical for the vast majority of users.<p>Commercial issues have a been a problem too.  For example the Google Play Store is not available in China (and many other countries).  Consequently users have to use a different store, and some have different incentives as app stores are not lucrative.<p>Finally we have the ""fragmentation"" issue.  Google did not implement Android in such a way that the majority of core could be upgraded by Google.  Consequently you end up with full stack releases which depend on manufacturers and carriers deploying after they have already sold a device - something they have no incentive to do.  This would need to be solved by aligning incentives, and is hard.<p>TLDR: the hard stuff is hard.  Application isolation is already done by all the mobile operating systems.  It is the nitty gritty details beyond that that need solving.",1359764474

Flying, turning, maintaining altitude, lining-up with the runway at the right place, time and speed and flying it in are entirely different matters.<p>I also have a relative who flew 747's.

I don't really see what you're accomplishing by adding a social layer on top of it.<p>If the killer feature is the recommendation engine social or otherwise, I don't think that you're selling it well enough. I also don't think that you have a good enough feature set for a decent learning model to consistently offer up good wines.<p>I once attempted to play around with this kind of domain space in the past. I was really disappointed at how hard it was to get the actual descriptions and star ratings of the wines I was looking at. I think the descriptions would actually be what would be useful for discovering new, awesome wines. For example, ""You consistently like wines that were described in terms like honey or berry, so we suggested this Chenin Blanc to you,"" or, ""This 2002 Cabernet Franc was suggested because you consistently favorite aged reds that are described with terms like 'tobacco' and 'leather'."" If you have that, then you've created an AI wine sommelier. Start pairing things with food, and you have an app that might go places. But the data you need to make that happen is really hard to come by.<p>Wine is also a messy topic because of the ridiculous amount of local producers, which means that in places where people actually enjoy wine, there's a good chance they're drinking something that isn't available on the API, at all. In fact, if you're a wine connoisseur, odds are you're trying to find progressively more obscure wines in the first place. In other words, why would I, as your target audience, want recommendations from anything unexhaustive?<p>This project shows a lot of skill integrating with APIs, though, and the design isn't bad. But it seems like more of a weekend hack project than a viable service. Still, from someone who once used a beer API to teach people about search engines, well done.",1359763550

A larger example is support for a bill that's bad for corporations but good for individuals.<p>The case of academic publishing is particularly strange. The following parties want articles to be freely available: the authors, universities, funding agencies, and the taxpayers who pay for some funding agencies. The flow of money is so perverse, and the culture of tradition so strong, that no one has a good immediate incentive to switch to open access, though.<p>This is an important problem because 99% of the world has no access to research that essentially everyone involved, except the publisher, wanted to be free. Or, if you think money is more important than access to research, consider that in 2011, Reed Elsevier made more money than any of these: Verizon, Nike, Mastercard, FedEx, Bank of America, Delta, or Amazon.com.

You might be able to buy a nice car, but don't expect a place in the Bahamas.<p>Work there if you really love the people or the idea. Enjoy your monthly paycheck.

127743,comment,122276,122281,0,0,gruseom,,,"This is an old thread, but I ran across the following statement by Philip Greenspun on p. 325 of <i>Founders At Work</i>:<p><i>The people who were really good software engineers were usually great writers; they had tremendous ability to organize their thoughts and communicate. The people who were sort of average-quality programmers and had trouble thinking about the larger picture were the ones who couldn't write.</i><p>I wish I had remembered this earlier. That the point was articulated by a sharp observer like Greenspun illustrates that it deserves attention beyond the rather glib formulation in the post we were discussing.",1204511604

Add meat to the bones: 500 LOC.<p>3. Start testing & find gaps: 700 LOC.<p>4. Keep testing until it works (almost) perfectly: 1000 LOC.<p>5.

127739,comment,127675,127675,0,0,dkokelley,,,"We need to know the answers to a few questions:<p>Do you know how the equity is currently divided? Is it 40-40 for the two founders (assuming only 2) and 20% left over? Have they taken any equity funding yet? Is it just starting out, or would you be employee number 13?<p>Knowing what they have available to offer, where they are along the start-exit line, and their current equity position will give you a good idea of how to negotiate.<p>Another angle, will you be taking a salary? If you're making a modest salary then it is perfectly acceptable to be offered only a small fraction of equity. You may very well be making more than the founders are.<p>If you want more equity in the company, offer to forgo a salary or take only what the founders are taking.<p><i>working at a startup is riskier for employees than for founders.</i><p>I disagree. The founders take the most risk, and get the most reward because of this. Founders typically make millions or $0. Employees don't typically make millions, but it's against the law for them to make 0. They earn a regular salary, which is less than the millions the founders might make, but they earn it consistently. There's a trade off.",1204511028

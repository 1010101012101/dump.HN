One way to further reduce risk is not actually charge the card until the product is delivered and buyer/seller happy. The initial charge would only be an authorization for the amount to make sure there were enough funds to cover. Either that or do a simple $1 authorization to make sure the card is valid. Either way the actual charge though would not be processed until buyer and the seller are happy.<p>Also, I would make sure that your terms & conditions on the site clearly outline every detail and protect you from liability.<p>From the US side I have never seen banks out right refuse as long as your personal/business credit is good and you would qualify for a merchant account under normal circumstances. Most here simply require a greater reserve and/or charge a higher percentage. I do know that Visa has some special requirements such as filing an application direct with them, paying a premium application fee, and then an annual fee on top, but I am not sure about the other cards.<p>You may want to talk to your bank directly. Go in with all the details, a flow-chart of how the process works, have the website ready to go, and all the details for your company/founders. It is sometimes easier to talk to a person face-to-face and have them understand clearly what you are trying to do.

Such a thing musn't be a secret. It's wrong to cover up a bad thing because it's hiding something that could hurt you and others in the future. If the government's job should be to keep the society's justice then it's absolutely necessary not to hide bad things otherwise they're lying. So it's not the government's place to hide bad secrets.<p>Good things don't need to be lauded (humility) and they don't need to be covered up either. Since it's not going to result in a bad thing and hurt the society then it doesn't have to revealed unless you would like to use the good thing. For example, if private stuff in his life is actually private and not hurting anyone else, then he should be allowed to keep the secret if he decides to because it's his own life.<p>If there is this principle to tell good and bad in people's activities then it solves his question.",1291675838

If you had $10 million dollars 2 years from now, and a 5% stake in your first venture, contacts lots of happy people and a reputation for succeeding with your first venture, don't you think you could own the shit out of your next company?

Put together a great team. Find VC firms who like to invest in your kind of thing. Develop just enough to get them interested. Set up appointments. Get funded. Exit with $10m or more in the bank.

",,"I'm involved in an online dating startup with one other cofounder and it has the interest of a prominent angel investor who is willing to pull the trigger with a full-time CTO on board (we are both mostly non-technical). 1.5 months in, and communication issues are beginning to surface (we didn't know each other that well before forming the company.) Although I know he is invested in the company/adds a lot of value, he maintains a consulting gig on the side to pay the bills, and he is very particular about how he divides his time between the two commitments. Whether it's for this or other reasons, he occasionally falls off the map (sometimes for days at a time) and doesn't pick up 99% of my calls first time around. Having said all this, he has been meeting his deliverables and progress on the company is being made.<p>At this point, I've sat him down twice to discuss the issue, but nothing has sunk in as there have been no improvements. My options are threefold:<p>a) Go solo with the project - risk him doing the same - and search for someone as a cofounder and/or CTO to build the product. I'm very into the concept but this will be a process as I'm a first-time entrepreneur, so I imagine attracting someone will be tough.<p>b) Give up on this project and commit full-time to another project I had been working prior to this opportunity. The other is more of a ""dude business"" (can easily outsource dev) which I am at least AS into as the former and I think I could learn a lot from. However, no interested investor and it's a monetized Q&A community, so probably won't have the same reach/credibility as an online dating site, assuming success in both cases.<p>c) Try to work out my differences with the cofounder (although it seems I already attempted this...) and try to forge a path forwards.<p>Any advice or feedback on this situation would be hugely appreciated.",1291675206

That doesn't mean Dynamo is an ACID system. You have to view the system as a whole, not just the component parts. The information systems I refer to in large banks, stock exchanges, and logistics are often composed of thousands of instances of ACID-compliant databases, but as a whole operate with eventual consistency guarantees. EC is kind of a misnomer for Dynamo anyways, because it's really TUNABLE consistency. Dynamo can operate in a fully consistent mode, but you're going to sacrifice availability.

1977039,comment,1976763,1976940,0,0,hesitz,,,"On a slightly different note -- and if your LaTeX needs aren't too complex -- I'm working on a clone of Emacs' Org-mode that runs in Vim.  Org-mode has a kick-ass export to LaTeX/PDF that adds a good portion of the markup based on your outline structure and some other simplified markup ( <a href=""http://orgmode.org/manual/Structural-markup-elements.html#Structural-markup-elements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orgmode.org/manual/Structural-markup-elements.html#St...</a> ), so a lot of the messy LaTeX markup can be left out of your main document.<p>I originally started work on my Org-mode clone in Vim because:<p>(1) I was a Vim user and couldn't quite make the switch to use Emacs' Org-mode,
(2) I loved Org-mode's export to LaTeX/PDF, and
(3) when I switched back to Vim from Org-mode I gave LaTeX-suite a try, but it felt a little too ""low-level"" for me.<p>So my thought was to write a simple outliner in Vim that was basically file-compatible with Org-mode (which was not too difficult), then call out to an Emacs server when I wanted to print to LaTeX/PDF.  (Same principle works to export to nicely formatted HTML document or any other export Org-mode has.)  This works very smoothly; assuming I have my Emacs server running initiating the export from Vim is just as fast and easy as if I were working directly Emacs.<p>Now I'm moving on to the more difficult task of duplicating other functionality in Org-mode, but if you just want a great way to author LaTeX docs in Vim my clone is already a decent solution for many uses.  You can alter the LaTeX preamble defaults and enter LaTeX commands directly in the Vim Org-mode file, but I'm not sure how usable it is for more complex documents.  Could do a little checking into Org-mode newsgroups to find out. . .<p>Anyway, for info on Org-mode's LaTeX publishing functionality see here:

<a href=""https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer</a><p>Caveat: The project is in its early state, there isn't much documentation, and there are of course bugs and incomplete features.  But for a basic export to LaTeX PDF or HTML all you need to do is (1) start up an Emacs instance to work as your server, (2) write or load an Org-mode outline into Vim that has the VimOrganizer ftplugin, and (3) issue command :OrgToPDF or :OrgToHTML.",1291673611

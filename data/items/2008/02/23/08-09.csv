Unless you meant ""internally-public"", in which case I think it's a pretty good idea.<p>Unfortunately, in most cases it is not simply employee laziness that drives people to waste time online, but a dull, non-challenging task which could be completed in an hour or two if it did not mean simply receiving additional work with no real benefit. In other words, I feel like the situations where it would be necessary would almost always be the same situations where the employee is actually acting rationally.",1203757016

At this point, however, I'm still debating whether or not I want to take another 15-30 minutes to go back and finish going over it.",1203756781

I'd rather HN be a resource for people who actually do things, and not a therapy session for people who can find no other reason to do something than that they should ""fucking doing it"".  For anyone with a soul, anything is more motivating than that.",1203756532

It's just that I always find it funny when someone echoes an idea almost exactly that they seemingly missed in the article. I think it's part of my assumption that the people on Hacker News actually read through an article before voting or commenting on it, but that could be changing (or I could just be wrong).",1203756428

121939,comment,121926,121926,0,0,mercurio,,,"It's a reward mechanism. It's mere existence makes it valuable.. kind of like fiat money :)<p>But seriously, on the micro scale, earning a single karma point feels good because it means somebody appreciates what you said. On a macro level, it lets you compete with other people, and serves the same purpose that high scores in video games do. Humans respond very well to an abstract notion of wealth, and humans are naturally competitive.",1203755480

121933,comment,121310,121781,0,0,mercurio,,,"I wonder about this too. Sometimes you come across thought provoking articles that cry out for comments, but there are none. If the article is already a few hours old and fallen off the front page, and you do post a comment, it probably won't get a response. This greatly decreases the incentive to comment (since what you want in the first place is to discuss it with others).<p>I now try and leave a comment if I find a good article that has slipped through the cracks.",1203754563

4273690,comment,4268525,4271919,1,0,einhverfr,,,"With the ability to define columns which store composite types, the line between a custom data type in C and a composite type plus casts is blurring.<p>Back in the 7.x line at one point I discovered that you could do something like:<p>create table foo (...);<p>create table bar (myfoo foo);<p>And this table would be write-only, and indeed the backend would <i>crash</i> when reading from it.  That's the only really interesting bug I ever found in PostgreSQL.  However, I made the case that it would be nice to be able to treat tuples as full-fledged data types and now by at least 8.1, that was supported.<p>So now I can:<p>create type foo as (...); -- works with create table too<p>create function foo_to_text .....;<p>create function text_to_foo ....;<p>create cast......<p>create table bar (my_foo foo);<p>insert into bar (my_foo) values ('my.foo.as.text'::text);<p>So the point is that composite types can now be used to blur the lines quite a bit between traditional custom types and the roles that composite types are traditionally used for.

See <a href=""http://www.genderads.com/page5/sexobject/sexobject.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.genderads.com/page5/sexobject/sexobject.html</a> for plenty of counter-examples.<p>> A long, reasoned debate showing how intelligent and wise a woman is won't do much for a 20-second ad.<p>Right, of course not. As I mentioned earlier, advertising is not the only medium in which this sort of objectification is prevalent.<p>>  I don't find this any more objectionable than ads using tan, muscular men to appeal to women, which I don't find objectionable at all.<p>Again, I don't think you can simply swap genders and call it a fair analogy. Additionally, at least in my experience, the number of advertisements, music videos, etc. that use the sex appeal of female body parts for commercial purposes far outweighs the number of equivalent things using tan, muscular, and similarly exposed men for commercial purposes.<p>> I completely agree. However, I don't see anyone defending it, people are mostly just saying ""this is just childish, not sexist, and isn't that big an issue"".<p>When confronted with criticism, arguing that the subject at hand is not a big deal is defense, is it not? I'm not saying anyone's promoting more use of 0xB16B00B5 in code, but there seem to be several commenters in here saying it's fine.<p>> If I am wrong about this, it will be precisely because I do not know how a woman would feel in this situation, so that's a bit of a moot question to ask me specifically.<p>It's actually not moot. I was interested in how you thought a woman might reacta question only you can answer. The actual reactions of women would vary quite widely from one to the next, of course. I'm sure some would laugh it off; I'm sure some would be offended. Personally, I'd be afraid that more women than men would be uncomfortable in this situation, and I don't like the idea of a development culture that makes women feel less comfortable or welcome than men. That's why I personally find it offensive. If you think women would be just as comfortable with this as men, then I would understand why you would not find it offensive.",1342835316

""Are you responsible"" is active voice but ""if papers were left on your desk"" is passive.<p>But this also gets to the problem of avoiding the passive voice which too many grammarians push, which is that there are times when the use of passive voice clarifies things.<p>The question, ""Are you responsible if papers are left on your desk?"" illustrates this very well.  The questioner assumes it doesn't matter who left the papers on the desk, and there is no way to better word the sentence.<p>So in this discussion I have intentionally split infinitives (to emphasize that the goal is to do better at wording sentences), and illustrated why the passive voice is great, and in so doing have probably permanently disqualified myself from a job where grammar nazis rule.",1342834953

You can characterize me as a stubborn child all you want (really solid argument tactic there BTW), I think abandoning users is a crappy thing to do. I also don't think I'm the only one who supported them with this opinion.<p>> Because I think a $9.99 mail client sale doesn't make a developer your indentured servant.<p>No because it has no bearing in reality. Your users don't care and aren't going to be understanding that you abandoned them. The theories you espouse are just things devs can tell themselves to make themselves feel better about doing what is, in essence, a really crappy thing to their users.<p>They don't change the reality. Likewise, users being mad at you doesn't equal indentured servitude. The only thing that defines indentured servitude is your ability to leave. They left. Is anyone demanding they return and continue the app? No. We're just making it known we support devs that support us.<p>> I think they'll be fine.<p>So long as they stay in the corporate world from now on. Should they switch back to a startup, plenty of users will hear ""from the Sparrow team"" in the future and avoid the product because they can't trust it will be available & useful for them in them when they need it.<p>They sold out their reputation in the iOS & OS X software world for jobs at Google. I hope that you're right and it was worth it. From what we've seen in the past, that won't be the case. Most startup types abandon those jobs within a couple years and are back to independent development right away. They might not find the user community so welcoming the second time around.",1342834458

4273577,comment,4273460,4273460,13,0,nhashem,,,"A lot of the job postings to me from YC startups seem absurd, since a lot of them seem to be looking for ""expert""-level roles.  For example, a lot of them are looking for a ""growth engineer.""  My interpretation is that they're basically saying, ""We have a cool product and anyone that hears about us seems to like us, so we need someone that can write code that will help more people hear about us.""<p>Or, more generalized: ""We have some huge thing we want to do, and can't do it ourselves, so we're looking for someone that can pretty much just come in and do it for us.""<p>And all the postings offer in terms of describing/selling why such a immensely talented individual would work for them is: ""We're reinventing the future of everything, we work hard and play hard, we can offer competitive salary and equity.""<p>The OP seems to feel this is borne out of some sort of maliciousness, but I really think this is mostly just cluelessness.  When you get a little bit of traction and you have a little bit of money in the bank, and you're trying to go even faster and you have 20 major initiatives you want to do and you can only work on like 2 at a time, it's easy to conclude, ""We need to hire!  We love our company, this is so much better than working at some corporate stuffy job, why wouldn't anyone think the same?""<p>Most of these companies would probably just be better served forgetting about hiring and building out the core product until they have more product-market fit, so they have enough revenue/funding to compensate employees closer to their talent level, and have a ""popular"" brand that people would want to actively work for.<p>Unfortunately this would mean delaying that 3rd party API, or porting your applcation to iOS, or started using SEO/SEM to drive some traffic, which all have huge learning curves that are tough to navigate while you have a ton of other things to do.  But if they were THAT critical, I would suggest those startups prioritize them over those other things and doing it themselves.",1342832837

The companies look like they were designed to get talent acquired in the first place!  They both have very small teams (2--5), Sparrow at least appears to have taken very small amounts of funding (just seed a year or two ago), and I can't name a consumer desktop application (especially a really generic one like mail with tons of free competitors) that has become a major $1bn+ (or even $100m+) business in the last several years.  There probably aren't enough eyeballs for ads, and App Stores have made consumer software cost expectations too cheap.  What's more, Sparrow is pretty much designed to make Google's offering better.<p>Is this interpretation wrong?  Could these small teams have built independent companies (rather than attractive teams for talent acquisition) on Mac desktop software in 2012?",1342832532

The developer would determine the trial period.  The developer would also decide if you get to try it on both an iPhone and an iPad or if you just get to check it out on a single device.  The OS would enforce the mechanism and keep everyone honest.<p>Once the trial period expires you have to pay for the app or it auto-removes itself.  Of course, you can always go back to the app store and purchase the app to get it back.<p>What I would hope this might do is create a situation where one could price apps at a higher level right from the start.  There are lots of apps that are not even worth $0.99.  I've certainly purchased a number of them.  At the same time, there are apps that are grossly under-priced.  The problem is that it is tough to get people to spend money on some of these apps, particularly if they've been burned by paid apps that are crappy.  An OS-enforced trial-period mechanism might allow developers to do quality apps and charge accordingly.  It would also allow users to really explore and find exactly what they want without having to waste money.<p>Having said that, my gut feeling is that Apple makes a ton of money from crap apps that go for $0.99.  People buy them to try them out and, because they are cheap, don't really get too worked-up about them afterwards.",1342832469

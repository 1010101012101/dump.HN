6625433,comment,6624701,6625178,13,0,rz2k,,,"Clearly meant as a rhetorical question, what do you really mean by it?<p>How many auditors caught the problems with Worldcom, Enron or Tyco? Extremely small minorities did, and yet people don&#x27;t question whether &#x27;accounting works, but they may question the incentives for companies to provide honest books to auditors, and the compensation awarded independent auditors.<p>Let&#x27;s say that you need someone to think that it will be sunny tomorrow, and you believe that it will be sunny tomorrow. The meteorologist&#x27;s forecast is for 20% chance of a thunderstorm. You tell your investor that meteorology is not a science. The real probability of a thunderstorm, given the conditions and the most accurate model possible is 18%, or maybe 4% or 93%.<p>What does any of this mean? Have you ever heard someone say that economics is not a science? Unfailingly, it comes from someone who has a bias toward a specific conclusion, and has no method explaining how they arrived at their conclusion other than something like &quot;common sense&quot;.<p>There was a renaissance for economic data collection in the wake of the 1929 crash, and the collapse of classical economics (How could the same capital equipment and human capital in 1932 produce about 48% of the industrial output it had in early 1929?). That was when most of the data collection programs were created, and the industrial classifications that were only revised again in the late 90s and early 2000s.<p>It is about as difficult to imagine the world of 7B people without modern economics as it is without integrated circuits or container ships or antibiotics or industrial and agricultural advances of the past 70 years.<p>Often in medicine, advances have met strong resistance from the respected people and overwhelming expert consensus (a very long list including how to prevent Pellagra, Yellow Fever, stomach ulcers, etc), and yet that is not a sane argument for abandoning medical research funding, condemning the practice of medicine as unscientific, or for choosing folk or &quot;traditional&quot; remedies instead.<p>And yet, that is what has happened over the past six years. To understand the value of this proposition regarding inflation requires an understanding of the mechanisms and justifications they describe, and then an attempt to assess the most likely outcomes of a course of action. In other words engagement, not people throwing up their hands and stating that it is impossible to choose any actions as better than any other, as though defeatism and fatalism are wise.",1382939961

When the money supply rises, firms in strong bargaining positions with few substitutes are in the best place to raise prices, because their customers can&#x27;t readily switch to competitors.  So basically, Google will come out of it like a bandit, because they&#x27;re the only game in town for search advertising, and their auction pricing means they don&#x27;t have to take any active effort to raise prices.  Walmart will come out of it pretty well, since in many communities they&#x27;re the only game in town.  Software engineers, skilled managers, and other workers with in-demand skills will do okay.  The folks competing for all the unskilled labor positions?  They&#x27;re going to get screwed.<p>So it&#x27;s only partially true that the poor benefit from inflation.  They&#x27;ll benefit from cheaper debt payments and possibly higher employment.

I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s even more extreme in legal and some professional services.<p>Property prices do not simply depend on the number of people looking to buy. They are also determined by how much people are willing and able to pay. If you strip out the inflated salaries they pay in finance, it&#x27;s going to trickle down to all other salaries and prices.<p>The financial sector employs large numbers of foreigners. If they leave, demand gets crushed. Also, let&#x27;s not forget that London property isn&#x27;t just bought to live in. It&#x27;s also an investment for rich people from all around the world.

But correlation is not causation, he says. Nevertheless, we were advised to reduce fat intake to 30% of total energy and a fall in saturated fat intake to 10%.<p>He points out that recent studies have not supported any significant association between saturated fat intake and risk of CVD.

He seems pretty addicted to it.<p>Let&#x27;s look at perhaps Greenwald&#x27;s biggest article critical of a single individual in recent times, his roast (let&#x27;s call it) of Sam Harris [1]. He starts by asserting that Harris &quot;[has] increasingly embraced a toxic form of anti-Muslim bigotry masquerading as rational atheism&quot; -- that &quot;he and others like him spout and promote Islamophobia under the guise of rational atheism.&quot; He then goes on to observe that &quot;Harris does far, far more than voice criticisms of Islam as part of a general critique of religion&quot; and presents quotes by Harris himself. He explains that &quot;Harris has used his views about Islam to justify a wide range of vile policies aimed primarily if not exclusively at Muslims, from torture [...] to steadfast support for Israel,&quot; that &quot;Harris sided with the worst Muslim-hating elements in American society by opposing the building of a Muslim community center near Ground Zero.&quot; Greenwald writes: &quot;In sum, he sprinkles intellectual atheism on top of the standard neocon, right-wing worldview of Muslims&quot;...<p>Yes, he labels the rhetoric that Harris &quot;spews&quot; as &quot;bile&quot;.. Yes, his own rhetoric is often of the pointed sort (&quot;That is the Harris worldview: obsessed with bad acts of foreign Muslims, almost entirely blind to - if not supportive of - the far worse acts of westerners like himself&quot;). But when it counts, his criticisms of people he disagrees with are usually maintain a careful composure, afaik.<p>In the comments section of his Guardian articles, it&#x27;s a different story. &quot;Do you know how to read?&quot; from a month or so before Snowden is the example that sticks out in my mind.

For example, the linked fact sheet notes that young girls who are treated in the chest for hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma (one of the rare types of cancers that young people get) have an elevated lifetime risk of ordinary breast cancer.

Whatever the counterfeiter buys that is in limited supply, the rest of the people have to do without.<p>To the extent that debt resembles counterfeiting, it is evil. Here&#x27;s an example: suppose you want to buy a prime waterfront property which is offered for auction. You&#x27;ve worked hard, saved your money in the bank, and you finally have enough deposited to make a substantial offer. At the auction, you meet Joe. Joe also wants the property. Joe hasn&#x27;t saved as much money as you have, but he has a line of credit from the bank, a line of credit made possible because the bank is using your on-deposit money as a reserve against which it can loan out new money. Whether or not you win the auction, the price of the real estate is higher than it would otherwise be because of Joe&#x27;s ability to bid against you. This seems wrong. Why should the fact that you saved money enable a non-saver to drive up your prices?<p>Note that without fractional reserve banking, Joe&#x27;s line of credit would be backed by money deposited for a term. So the saver&#x27;s prices should not be affected by the borrower, because the while the borrower is using the money, the saver has agreed not to use it.

Because the fundamental disagreement between the Austrians and the more mainstream academic schools of thought is epistemological. Data can only settle differences when both sides agree on the epistemological ground rules.<p>I have an advanced science degree. I&#x27;m not afraid of math, and I&#x27;ve plowed through Keynes &quot;General Theory&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t come close to passing the sniff test for basic scientific rigor. It <i>can&#x27;t</i>.<p>Economists can&#x27;t control their variables, and they have no way of knowing what their error bars are. They can make empirical models that work most of the time, but they can&#x27;t know what regime those models are valid for, and where the breaking point is. There is every indication that economic systems are chaotic, and prone to sudden discontinuous phase changes.<p>Worse, unlike a chaotic system like weather, the underlying primitives are not at all primitive. We can say very precisely how a cubic meter of air (for example) behaves under widely varying conditions. This is why our weather and climate models keep getting better -- you can use more processing power and better algorithms and use the basic laws of physics to get the right answers, despite a system of incredible complexity.<p>But economists have nothing like that to work with. There is no meaningful sense in which we have good statistical models of human economic behavior. We have very limited snapshots, that are invalidated the moment customs or conditions change beyond the originally observed regime.<p>All of this means that you can&#x27;t even build empirical models unless you have a preexisting, <i>a priori</i> theory of economic cause and effect, and you have no experiments strong enough to falsify bad <i>a priori</i> assumptions. The Austrian argument is simply that all economists are actually engaged in <i>a priori</i> theorizing, despite their protestations claiming to be empiricists.<p>I find the assertion that the Austrian school is more &quot;intuitive&quot; and accessible to be silly. Nobody who has actually tried to study the primary texts would claim so. It takes a pretty strong background in philosophy just to follow the first several chapters of Human Action -- precisely because they focus on epistemological issues.<p>It doesn&#x27;t require a conspiracy theory to explain the popularity of econometrics. Lots of social sciences spent the whole 20th century pretending to be as rigorous as physics and chemistry, to bask in the reflected glow of progress.

NOT that he calls a lie a lie, but instead he frequently both uses insults, and assumes malice.<p>In writing for the public, especially if you hope to convince anyone of anything, those are huge mistakes.<p>Glenn consistently calls things and people &quot;stupid&quot; (very little on earth is stupid, when it looks that way there are factors influencing the behavior you aren&#x27;t accounting for, and addressing those factors has a far more persuasive effect than cursing the person who behaves under their influence as &#x27;stupid&#x27;).<p>Secondly, Mr Greenwald _very_ frequently implies people are behaving with malice. Malicious action is the worst thing you can accuse someone of; if a person is truly malicious they are beyond reason (because their reasoning ability tells them to hurt you.) Very few people on this planet operate with malice outside of the moments they&#x27;re passionately enraged. Instead, tons of us hurt each other because we&#x27;ve been conditioned to do some action that has effects we don&#x27;t acknowledge, because we&#x27;re faced to choose between hurting ourselves or offloading it onto someone else and don&#x27;t know how to do it better, or a similar reason.<p>I believe Glenn will end up an editor, or in some senior position where his instinct informs other journalists where to look for stories, but as for the actual research and writing? To maintain the relationships you need with sources and the public, you have to understand the points I&#x27;ve written above, and Mr. Greenwald doesn&#x27;t seem to show any tendency to move in that direction.

When I think of enterprise or over-complication, I think of a system where logic is so deeply embedded in the server and client that if the client or server changes in any way, everything breaks. REST was designed to better handle changes between a client and server. For instance, if you built your API to use something like Collection+JSON, then it could be instantly read and understood by any Collection+JSON client (much like in the way the HAL browser works [1]). You could change things, move things, even redo URLs, and the client will still work.<p>If, on the other hand, you don&#x27;t conform and use HATEOAS, you have to go look at the documentation on how to build the URL to make a call to the API. Your client can never explore an API, but must be built to make certain calls to certain URLs that are built a certain way.<p>True REST with HATEOAS was what HTTP 1.1 was built around. It may take some extra work to implement, but it was designed to make communication over the web simpler (and it&#x27;s worth the trouble). Unfortunately, this article is not really endorsing what REST is, but rather a very common RPC that has been popularized by Rails and labeled as REST.<p>[1] <a href=""http://haltalk.herokuapp.com/explorer/browser.html#/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haltalk.herokuapp.com/explorer/browser.html#/</a>",1382937140

6625266,comment,6624701,6624701,6,0,acslater00,,,"I&#x27;m happy to see this article written, and it will hopefully start to change the attitude of evaluating central bank actions through the lens of &#x27;high inflation bad, low inflation good&#x27;.<p>This whole debate is an unfortunate example of what&#x27;s called &quot;Partial Equilibrium Reasoning&quot; (as opposed to &quot;General Equilibrium Reasoning&quot;). All things being equal, higher inflation is bad. That&#x27;s clear. But all things aren&#x27;t equal, and so appeals to logic about how inflation is a hidden tax on &#x27;the people&#x27; and so forth are essentially worthless when applied to real-world situations.<p>Here&#x27;s why. One weird thing about inflation is that inflation expectations become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because when people predict inflation, they demand escalating prices on things like 10-year leases and labor contracts, and when they don&#x27;t predict inflation, they don&#x27;t.<p>The situation today, in 2013 America, and not fake-year hypothetical-country in your economics textbooks, is that \ninflation expectations are extremely low. They are low because inflation is essentially a by-product of economic expansion, and most people predict that economic expansion will be weak for the foreseeable future.<p>As it turns out, the reverse of this is true. If people expected the economy to start growing strongly, their inflation expectations would likely rise, which would probably be enough all-on-its-own to cause inflation to rise. Weird, right?<p>So it turns out that if the economy were to strengthen, one thing you&#x27;d notice in the data would be slightly higher inflation. And you&#x27;d go, &quot;Well that&#x27;s no good, but at least the economy is improving!&quot; And you would be looking at a General Equilibrium in which most people are better off <i>even though</i> inflation is slightly higher, because many other things (Nominal Growth, Real Growth, Unemployment, Long-Term Interest Rates for savers) would be moving in the _good_ direction.<p>This dynamic is why the Fed needs to break the attitude that its job is to keep inflation  as low as possible. The worst thing that could happen in the above scenario is for people to think &#x27;Uh oh, inflation is going up, that means the Fed will probably raise interest rates&#x27;, which would have the (expected) effect of reducing economic growth. But we need growth! And we need to accept that a few percentage points of inflation will be a by-product of that in a healthy economy.<p>So to summarize, the issue here is not that inflation is good. It&#x27;s that there is more to this picture than inflation, and that if you have a dogmatic belief that inflation is evil in all situations and should be avoided, you&#x27;ve probably read too much Hayek and it has melted your brain.<p>[sorry, had to drop a snipe]",1382936785

(My dad wrote his Ph.D dissertation on it, and he had a HD and some game disks before I somehow destroyed them.) I remember that computer fondly. When I was in first grade we got a new machine, and we took the Mac Plus out and left it next to the apartment complex dumpster that morning. By the afternoon it was gone. Sometimes, I still think about it...who picked it up, whether they plugged it in and found out it was still completely functional, and if they still have it today.<p>Memories.",1382936627

6625251,comment,6623935,6623935,1,0,CamperBob2,,,"Sounds like the right solution would be for Facebook to lower the social weight attached to the &quot;friend&quot; bit.  They could turn it into a scalar quantity that&#x27;s boosted when you interact with your &quot;friend&quot; in some fashion, and that otherwise decays over time.  When it reaches zero, the unfriending process happens silently and automatically.<p>That way, if you don&#x27;t visit your &quot;friend&quot;&#x27;s page in x days, they are no longer your &quot;friend.&quot;  You can always restore the connection later by visiting the person&#x27;s page -- and of course Facebook would continue to track the link forever as part of their attempt to run their own private NSA or whatever they do with their graph data -- but from the users&#x27; point of view, the act of unfriending would become an inoffensive, passive one that no one can be blamed for.",1382936488

The answer is in details.""<p>One of the other relevant details is that any subsidies that are provided are done so by the wireless carriers, not Apple. Apple gets paid in full for each iOS device sold, either by the carrier (iPhones), or by the customer direct (the other iOS devices). By being immediately profitable on each iOS device, Apple has no ""subsidy variables"" to factor into its profitability -v- product lifecycle calculations.",1317574745

(One Medscape article, for example: 'bipolar II depression. . . carries the highest suicide risk among all subtypes of major mood disorders.')""<p>This is some of the most important information in the article. Just before the quoted paragraph, the author notes that it is unusual for people in the hypomanic phase or manic phase of a mood disorder to seek treatment, because most people in that mode state feel great. Treatments vary for mood disorders between those with manic and hypomanic phases and those without, because of course many treatments that elevate mood can cause vulnerable persons to switch into hypomania or even mania from depression.<p>It's a bit early (over the course of the author's lifetime, and in terms of the number of patients who have tried to apply his advice) to conclude that what he thinks helped him function better would work for a lot of other patients. He sometimes concedes that, in his own words in his article, but seems to end with a flourish and announcement that he has found a general answer. Anyone dealing with this issue would be well advised to do what the author advised in one part of his article and check with an experienced M.D. before figuring that self-treatment will do the whole job.",1317574339

They're the ones who are getting screwed.<p>The context of what most people are saying is that founders are now getting their pound of flesh from VCs/investors (summary of other comments, not this thread.) The tone of those comments is that founders are simply putting steps in place to ensure they don't get screwed.<p>If this is the case (I don't know how true it is) then the marker for who gets hosed lands squarely on those early employees, and THAT will be a gigantic problem for startups. If early employees begin to distrust founders and investors, it's not just a headwind -- it's pretty much game over. Early employees are quite often the difference between success & failure. Those top-flight team members you need to execute on that idea will use the only leverage they have in that relationship -- they simply won't join the startup.<p>I hope AirBnB is an anomaly, but I expect this type of scenario to happen more and more. As for founders wanting to put themselves in position to do this -- who could blame them? But, it's not without consequence and their reputation as startup founders will be summarily tested with any future ventures.<p>The smartest startups will very quickly learn that success will only come when all parts are working together, doing their jobs -- founders, investors, early employees.",1317574290

I meant no offense and basically have been trying to tell you (among other things) that your use of ""stupid"" is just asking people to chime in!<p>I was born and raised in Argentina, though this should not matter, nor does it need to be ""disclosed"". I knew what the WolframAlpha plots would look like because I have lived the situation. Look, Argentina has been an exceptional country for many reasons (mostly bad), and it's not a too-big-to-fail state such as the US or Italy, so clearly its experiences need not apply to other countries.<p>In that respect, I <i>do not</i> agree with crag's suggestion that <i>anything</i> applicable to Argentina in 2002 could be applied to the rest of the lot in 2011. The thing is, though, that instead of raising your valid points about simplistic causation, etc., you mistakenly pointed (and in a snarky way) to Argentina's ""currency crisis"", i.e., devaluation, then to default, in turn linking them to social distress. Please convince yourself: in Argentina things got way better after default, devaluation and big spending, <i>which took place at the same time</i>. Argentina's real currency collapse can be found here [1] (with relatively little unemployment and poverty, by the way). There was no IMF-imposed austerity after the default: most of that austerity was recommended in order to meet debt obligations up to 2002, and leaving that cycle was the whole point of the default! Even though Kirchner was smart enough to pay the IMF debt, following the steps of Russia and Brazil, <i>just to get them off his back</i>, there was no state austerity after the default.<p>As for my first link, I thought (mistakenly) you implied that Argentina had gotten worse since the default, and I provided a recent article with a snappy reply. Not very constructive, I admit and concede.<p>Beer in hand, I salute you!<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#Argentina"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#Argentina</a>",1317573176

Like you, I typically write HTML in HTML, but often use asciidoc for other purposes (documentation, recipes, quick notes, etc.), because:<p>- One source document can output to multiple formats, like XHTML, LaTeX, PDF, DocBook, EPUB, Man page, etc. It's even trivial to output to a specific HTML DOCTYPE. That's pretty neat!<p>- Diffs are far more readable when not swimming in markup soup.<p>- HTML is overkill for many purposes. In fact, lightweight markup has its roots in email/newsgroup markup. HTML email is still a compatibility nightmare. Wouldn't it be great if a new standard for rich text email was developed, based on something as simple as markdown? It would be trivial to support it in webmail interfaces and the source would still be readable in plaintext email clients or if the sender went overboard with style choices.<p>- Archivability. Many old HTML documents render poorly in modern browsers, mainly due to style choices that seemed sensible at the time. Lightweight markup focuses more on the content and discourages going off on a stylistic tangent you may regret later. In other words, it does a good job of separating content from presentation, so your source documents will always remain readable and transform to something readable with relatively few tweaks in external stylesheets or configuration files.<p>Because it's easy to learn without getting lost in the arcane details of validation and compatibility, it's understandable why it's gaining popularity.",1317572310

[Probably the can of Mace in the short term, iPhone photo in the long term, and yes, you don't need Color for the still. But for documenting a crime in progress, easily pushing photo + live video to 700 friends is probably going to be as or more effective than calling the police.]<p>3) Instant web meetings and tours of distributed facilities.

They tried something like this a few months ago with the Royal Wedding, but it's much more interesting when it's not ""experience static photos of people near you"" but rather ""experience life through a video camera held up by a person far from you"". This is because photos of the event are not novel for the few people that are near, but live video of the event is novel for the many people that are far.<p>5) If they ship this soon, I expect it to be used for people to vicariously experience the Occupy Wall Street thing...or else perhaps for Halloween and then New Year's Eve.

However, despite the link title above, Markdown isn't a web design language at all. It's for writing and editing copy, which is a very different task.<p>Let's say you have a bunch of untrained writers who needs to do some semantic formatting. They don't know HTML, so you can't ask them to just write HTML. If you let them run rampant with a WYSIWYG word processor (probably Word) you'll wind up with monstrosities where fonts were manually bolded and enlarged to indicate headers and such, and someone has to clean up after it.<p>If you have Markdown editors, though, you can turn an untrained writer loose with a cheat sheet (""write # to get a header"" and such) and you're all set. As a bonus, you can put the Markdown document in version control, export to formats besides HTML, and a few other useful things.<p>Some major websites like reddit have also successfully made use of Markdown and its competitors to permit rich text comments from people who know nothing about HTML.",1317571244

It really is amazing when you look at how these things work. I also used to collect late 1800's typewriters but they were taking up too much room.<p>What amazes me about antique tech is that the ergonomics and the engineering were inter-meshed.  Today we can put a button and a chip anywhere so the design and engineering are quite separate as long as one accommodates the other.  But if you look at for example a mechanical typewriter, the entire thing is engineered to function in an ergonomic sense as well.  Not only does the lever have to work, it has to require not too much force to activate, strike the ribbon with enough force to transfer ink, return to position quickly, avoid the other levers in their paths of motion, while all being arranged in such a way as to fit our big meaty hands comfortably.  It truly is a lost art form.",1317571203

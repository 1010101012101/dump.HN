2455426,comment,2453988,2454729,10,0,danenania,,,"These are well-worn fallacies. First, falling prices do not cause hoarding--demand for goods will increase if anything. Mild deflation is actually the sign of a healthy economy, competition, and technological innovation. Just look at the consumer electronics industry. Why do people buy iPads when they know a cheaper and better one will come along in the next couple years? According to your theory, wouldn't they just sit on their money?<p>The second fallacy is that 'hoarding' (long term saving, in other words) is a problem for an economy. It simply demonstrates a longer term time preference, which is actually necessary for larger and more complex uses of capital which can often take 10-20 years of investment and planning to pay off. It is axiomatic that the only purpose for hoarding cash is to eventually spend it.

Their website is incredibly clean and intuitive and they're not trying to sell you something on every page like GoDaddy does.<p>I bought a domain name from a guy in Brazil. We exchanged over 100 emails back and forth with the help of Google Translate and when it came time for the guy to transfer his domain, somehow Name.com had a woman on staff who spoke Brazilian Portugese who helped facilitate the transfer.<p>I'd never go back to Godaddy",1303005944

So, that guy buys your couch for $300 (in the promo video) and guess what, no $ gets deposited into your bank account. In the merchant world, that's called a chargeback. 99.9% of the consumers have no idea what this means...you don't get paid and it typically costs you additional fees.<p>Merchant clearing companies ONLY provide an authorization and a money transfer service for their vig. This means, consumers (and businesses) have nobody working for them and no protection against the deadbeat or scammer.<p>So, you can buy that 108"" LCD TV on your AMEX, have it delivered to a friend's house, call the merchant back and claim you didn't receive it, and the merchant will get the chargeback since they can't prove you signed for it.

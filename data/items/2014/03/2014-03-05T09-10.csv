7346197,comment,7340810,7346087,8,0,mbrock,,,"I appreciate bluntness; here&#x27;s my blunt response to that thought.<p>Your comment and the comment you replied to have very quickly established an argument with two sides, a duality. This is a tired old debate that is based on a confused pseudo-theory about human nature.<p>I&#x27;ll just address the side you have chosen. You&#x27;re postulating that the person who has issues with the drug probably has issues in general. The logic seems to be that since the drug has no will of its own, it is a kind of neutral object that should not be blamed. Fine; that&#x27;s reasonable enough.<p>But is there also an aspect of defensiveness? That is, this herb has a positive valence for you, and so any negativity associated with it must be shifted towards some essential source -- so that the neutrality of the drug is maintained.<p>Personally I think it&#x27;s both amusing and sad that it&#x27;s so difficult to have a rational, clear-headed conversation about these things. Part of that is probably because the issue of criminality looms in the background, making everything into a heavily value-loaded &quot;statement,&quot; causing stigma and demonization and, on the flip side, valorization and blame-shifting.<p>It&#x27;s the same thing but much worse with stronger psychedelics. The whole discussion becomes &quot;are they good or evil?&quot; And by extension, &quot;are people who use it good or evil?&quot; It&#x27;s simply stupid, unenlightened, regressive.<p>Because the real discussion is &quot;What should we do given that these molecules do exist?&quot; How should we think about them? When are they useful and when do they cause harm? How do these particular kinds of harm work? How can we provide help and guidance to people who -- for whatever reason -- experience these molecules as a negative, seductive, destructive presence in their lives? How can we harness whatever good potential they have? Etc etc etc.<p>We&#x27;re treating these molecules as if they were capricious Olympic gods, but they&#x27;re just substances that happen to affect the human mind in different ways.",1394013532

User forgot their password: he contacts staff that uses their key + web server&#x27;s key to move funds to new destination.<p>2. Hackers have taken the web server: they see the key, but it&#x27;s not enough to move anyone&#x27;s funds.<p>3. Staff lost their keys: users still can access their funds if they still remember their passwords.<p>4. Hackers stole user&#x27;s computer: they may instantly withdraw some amount up to an arbitrary daily limit. (Withdrawal can also be protected by 2-factor authentication.)<p>5. Hackers stole staff&#x27;s keys (e.g. from a personal computer): they still need to break into web server. When staff realizes that keys are compromised, all funds must be moved immediately to new keys.<p>In other words, users have a hard proof of ownership of specific coins.

Thhere can&#x27;t be must overheard to a single include to pull in the html, but you could render the enter page.

I cut my teeth on a Mac only system that more or less only talked to Filemaker, which was only as fast as the actual screen could redraw and search out the data.  It could be painfully slow.<p>In a way I am glad, as I learned how to do things and think differently when most were just running a &quot;select * from foo where bar = &#x27;x&#x27;&quot; which was a 15 minute luxury I didn&#x27;t have. There were no joins, no tables, you actually ran applescripts on the database and it returned the data somehow back to a web server on the Mac.<p>So we used the database on the backend, where admins could be more patient, or do more intricate things, but almost always generated out some HTML, so in the end, the site was semi-dynamic.  I think I was doing &quot;caching&quot; of data as a result almost 15 years ago.<p>The rule was, no more than 2 database calls per page, ever.  And you couldn&#x27;t do things like update foo set name = &#x27;me&#x27; where id = 1, because there was no exposed notion of a record id, it was internal, so you had to select name from foo where name = &#x27;whatever&#x27; which would return the name, but also a RedID value, which you then got to run another query to update foo set name = &#x27;me&#x27; where if = <special RecID token><p>Made me think a bit different.",1394011327

Linus was behaving as though he believed something like this:</i><p><i>8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.</i><p><i>Or, less formally, ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.&#x27;&#x27; I dub this: ``Linus&#x27;s Law&#x27;&#x27;.</i><p><i>My original formulation was that every problem ``will be transparent to somebody&#x27;&#x27;. Linus demurred that the person who understands and fixes the problem is not necessarily or even usually the person who first characterizes it. ``Somebody finds the problem,&#x27;&#x27; he says, ``and somebody else understands it. And I&#x27;ll go on record as saying that finding it is the bigger challenge.&#x27;&#x27; That correction is important; we&#x27;ll see how in the next section, when we examine the practice of debugging in more detail. But the key point is that both parts of the process (finding and fixing) tend to happen rapidly.</i><p><i>In Linus&#x27;s Law, I think, lies the core difference underlying the cathedral-builder and bazaar styles. In the cathedral-builder view of programming, bugs and development problems are tricky, insidious, deep phenomena. It takes months of scrutiny by a dedicated few to develop confidence that you&#x27;ve winkled them all out. Thus the long release intervals, and the inevitable disappointment when long-awaited releases are not perfect.</i><p><i>In the bazaar view, on the other hand, you assume that bugs are generally shallow phenomena—or, at least, that they turn shallow pretty quickly when exposed to a thousand eager co-developers pounding on every single new release. Accordingly you release often in order to get more corrections, and as a beneficial side effect you have less to lose if an occasional botch gets out the door.</i><p><i>And that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s enough. If ``Linus&#x27;s Law&#x27;&#x27; is false, then any system as complex as the Linux kernel, being hacked over by as many hands as the that kernel was, should at some point have collapsed under the weight of unforseen bad interactions and undiscovered ``deep&#x27;&#x27; bugs. If it&#x27;s true, on the other hand, it is sufficient to explain Linux&#x27;s relative lack of bugginess and its continuous uptimes spanning months or even years.</i>",1394011092

CSS scales in big sites, reduces load times and lets you do many, many clever things you couldn't do in raw HTML and makes life easier, especially when combined with a CMS.<p>And that site is ugly and it's not because of tables. The site would look better without any graphics of styling at all. Hating Photoshop is not a good reason for having a site that's horrendously ugly.<p>But I do agree content is king. Just as well that he has something worthwhile that makes people look past the godawfully bad site.",1212922363

For example, it's the scripting language of Cisco routers, so that number may include the salaries of CCIEs.<p>I myself am quietly delivering Tcl/Tk apps in my organization, people are liking what they see and not questioning the language :-)",1212921949
212063,comment,212005,212005,0,0,BSeward,,,"The author pooh-poohs CSS, and pooh-poohs bulky sites, but the table-heavy pages on the site have many repeated, wasteful inline styling tags. Some trivial, cross-compatible CSS would streamline the site further (admittedly, down from almost never more than 40kB HTML, but streamlining is streamlining).<p>That said, I was jonesing for Zelda seriously less than 10 minutes ago, so he can do whatever he wants for so long as he makes getting my fix possible.",1212921923

212060,comment,211888,211888,0,0,aneesh,,,"Trains work well for short distances.  The commuter rail from Baltimore to DC for $7, and 45 minutes is great.  But if you're traveling 3+ hours, it's probably cheaper to fly.<p>I recently rediscovered another underappreciated mode of transportation:  the bike.",1212920908
212059,comment,211782,212019,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My point was that it is an additional bit of friction that isn't present in Ruby or Python (though they also have their own bits of friction).  Even though I've written a lot of code in my life, I've never been a full-time software developer, and so it's one of the tricky bits that drops out of my head during the breaks in between writing code.  I'm interacting with code written by someone very comfortable with these idioms, and so they show up all over the place, and I never quite get them right the first time.  I just think it's an area that makes Perl trickier than it ought to be...it's not a deal breaker (PHP's lack of first class functions, for example, now <i>that's</i> a deal breaker).  I'm basically a raving Perl fan, but arrays only holding scalars is a nuisance.<p>And, as I mentioned, Perl 6 goes a long way to correcting pretty much everything I don't like about Perl 5.",1212920353

It should be possible to develop a set of metrics for code quality that would apply to apps using particular languages and libraries. These metrics would be general and very imperfect, but they would still have some utility. For example, it would be fairly easy to develop an automated metrics program to run on a given Ruby on Rails app. Things like depth of nesting in code, reported errors per statement, average lines of code per function.<p>What if there was a website where you could download a metrics app, which would take the measurements, then upload the data to a web app, where someone could login and see how well their shop stacks up in comparison to the general population of shops using the same language and library?<p>This would give hiring shops some way to quantify the maturity of the shops a prospective hire has worked.",1333659551

3804583,comment,3803715,3803715,10,0,jordhy,,,"One CAN get initial traction and customers without having to be an internet celebrity.<p>A fantastic first step is to ask to the internet marketing community. I'll summarize my tips on this issue to try and help the readers as much as I can, but please reach out to SEO/SEM/Branding people in the community at each stage of your start-up journey so you can keep learning, growing and driving traffic to your site.  So here's my advice to find those early customers:<p>- Build a fascinating product. Something that is better than every competitive proposal in one or more dimensions (design, speed, simplicity, robustness, etc). You know you have this when you feel passionate about your product. At this point, it doesn't matter to have erred in some minor market assumptions. Just do a solid MVP given your current understanding of the market needs.<p>- Go to search.twitter.com and find 50 people that are looking for the solution you provide (i.e. search for ""i want a widget that does x"")<p>- Network with this group of 50, give them premium accounts and give them early access to your product. Congrats, you've got a nice beta testing team with a desire for your product.<p>- Reverse engineer the ""mind-set"" of this group of people: do they want speed, low price or robust functionalities? Then, according to this create ""personas"", ergo user profiles.<p>- Now comes the fun part: you're going to market to each independent user profile with a separate marketing effort. Before doing this, install Mixpanel and make sure you're tracking EACH distinct user profile. Then place one Google Adwords campaign for each profile. You want to discover which user profile prefers your product, which type of user converts best, etc. To get ideas for keywords I recommend Wordtracker.com (some people like the Google keyword tool, but that's ok as well).<p>- Since now you know the type of user you want to target raise your bets: create multiple landing pages for this user type (the article gives you a good idea of how to do just that).<p>- Tweak the conversion rate (ratio of sign-ups per visits) that each page gives you. Ideas to do this include: creating professional introductory videos, adding testimonials, doing basic A/B testing, refining your copy, etc.<p>- Keep refining you product. And. keep. marketing. There's so so much you can do on a budget: pay for press releases to boost your page rank and get initial awareness (under 400 dollars on prweb.com), join several interest groups and promote to their mailing list, etc.<p>- Internet famous celebrities don't have THAT high of an advantage over you (when it comes to marketing). They DO have great advantages when it comes to raising money but, for the purpose of building a compelling MVP... how many people do you need? Not many. You're better off with a mix of the right people and a tight knit community.",1333659304

You don't need considerable planning for something such as a phone, as the cost of entry is low enough that it typically falls closer to the impulse buy end of the spectrum.  The exceptions are poor economic markets, or heading into the holiday buying season.  Even televisions are at a low enough price and have enough points-of-sale where they end up being more of a casual purchase.<p>Cars get away with the concept approach because the average person won't go out and just drop the cash required for a Type 981 Porsche Boxster ($50K+) or even a Subaru BRZ ($26-30K).  However, if the hole in a hungry market is large enough, sales will blow well past sales projections regardless (see Subaru BRZ).  Yes, you'll always have enthusiasts that always will throw money at manufacturers regardless of pricepoint, but that's largely unsustainable except for very low volume vehicles (special edition sports cars) or immediately following availability unless you have something truly novel (see Toyota Prius upon initial availability).<p>When you start dropping to more around a $1000 price point for something you're not yet planning to produce as depicted until years from now, there's a term for that: vaporware.

In my examples, you have effectively tied a person's hands by banning the use of firearms, and now they are dead because of it.  They had no chance because you wanted to feel safer.  In your example, I merely enable people to act rationally and in their best interest by allowing them to own a firearm for their defense and the defense of others - this sometimes goes wrong, as people do not always act rationally.  I don't feel bad about that, as they are responsible for their actions, not me, much in the same way I don't feel bad about owning a vehicle when someone drives theirs through a crowded market.<p>In response to your second argument, we can go on about that all day as to who is capable of evil and who is not (the answer is probably everyone).  My point still stands - violent crime is on the decline, and no amount of hyping up the (relatively) few deaths that occur per year due to some 'random crazy guy with a gun' is going to change that fact.  Most gun violence is drug related.<p>In the end, this argument comes down to a principle.  Are you willing to try and disarm everyone to make a 'safer' society, even though you know that in doing so you are basically denying people the right to defend themselves, saying that their death is necessary to prevent the death of many more (maybe) and a generally safer society (arguably)?  Or are you willing to give people the ability to purchase weapons from a legal (regulated) market to defend their lives, knowing that, in the end, the police can't be everywhere and can't save everyone?<p>Both have pros and cons, but I find the first option to be a particular form of collective restraint against the freedom of the individual that is morally unacceptable.

I think that a situation where you must roll a completely custom in-house compiler that generates binaries which exceed 1 GB in size in order to get adequate performance of your app is a good candidate for a new architecture, despite Spolsky's claims. Spolsky's article discusses throwing out pages of code because the programmers ""don't know what half of these API calls are for"" and ""[wanting] to build something grand"" -- these are quite different impulses than the real-world problems staring Facebook in the face by its continued usage of PHP.<p>I think also that there is a difference between writing a new backend for something that is solid and in place and just throwing the whole product out the window and re-imagining it from the ground up, and I think the latter is the kind of rewrite that should be avoided and considered dangerous. When you could throw 4-5 guys on a real C# or C++ rewrite and tell them the final product has to behave identically to the PHP version, you have a much less volatile situation.<p>As for the PHP workflow, I agree it's nice not to have an intermediate step, but that intermediate step can usually be circumvented pretty rapidly by throwing a script or two (or just flipping a config option) into your development environment.",1333658106

Most people have average values.  If someone is on LinkedIn, I'm more interested to see if they have X hundred followers per years in industry up to some maximum lifetime value.

Most engineers are like that -- again, the public numbers are biased to certain individuals.  Maybe there is a way for candidates to quantify the projects they have worked on?<p>* What I would love is a way to automatically assess FizzBuzz on candidates.

Not that white males who drink dry martinis cant do the job, but theres no real difference between advertising for a Ninja and throwing half your resums away because you dont like unlucky people. Either way, you end up with fewer resums.</i><p>This is so true, so important, and so many startups (and even bigger companies!) miss this.  Job ads provide cues, conscious and subconscious, to the people reading them.  Not everyone reading the ad is identical to the person writing it, and a badly written job ad can easily send the message <i>""this company isn't for you""</i> to a large number of skilled potential applicants.  This applies not just to categories like gender or race, but even to personality types and personal interests.  Unless you really want a company of only extroverts, for example, don't write a job ad that scares off introverts.<p>In the canonical example, if you constantly ask for ""rock stars"", you will turn off people to whom that doesn't appeal, including tons of good programmers.  But it goes beyond that: don't assume that all your applicants are any particular kind of person with certain interests.  A job ad should focus on what the job actually is, and things that are important to the job.<p>The best programmers often have a lot of choice in where they work, and as many HNers know from experience, if they see a job ad that turns them off in some fashion, they will probably not even bother reading further: they know they have better options, so yours probably isn't worth their time.  If the vast majority of skilled programmers skip over your resume, it's no wonder you only receive resumes from unqualified applicants.<p>In short, when writing a job ad, you need to <i>think from the perspective of people applying</i>.  Use your empathy, put yourself in their shoes, rather than just writing what you think looks cool.",1333656665

Bit of a shame, as many will go away without adapting, and there are still opportunities for them to adapt/pivot and carve out new niches.

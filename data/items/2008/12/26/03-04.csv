409928,comment,409562,409924,0,0,albertni,,,"That's a little harsh. It was a pretty significant anecdote - a 6.5x decrease with the only clear change being Pallotta's company-charity being forcibly stopped from continued involvement. Is there room for other plausible reasons to have caused the drop? Definitely. And of course if, hypothetically, Pallotta's company-charity was involved with sufficiently many causes, you would even expect there to be at least one anecdote with such a substantial drop. But to call it ""1/10,000 of a good start"" is much more unreasonable and illogical than thinking the anecdote might be of worth.",1230262437

409923,comment,409774,409774,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I'd go for the gold.  30,000 years of history deserve more respect than 100 years of a weird economy with major problems and a dearth of good explanations.  So, physical gold, some silver, some mining company stocks, and maybe diversify by buying some stock in an farm company in US.   Have some cash stashed away, and maybe buy some index funds.<p>My ideal portfolio:<p>25% bullion (Mostly gold, some 14k gold rings, some silver, along with a digital balance and a jeweller's touchstone kit for determining purity).<p>15% cash in a sock.<p>16% mining company stock.<p>12% index fund.<p>7% ag company (basic foodstuff, like wheat or other cereals).<p>15% in a savings account.<p>1 pistol, 1 body armor and 3 years of ammo.  Consider investing in self-defense and food.<p>I know, it's very reddit of me, but this way, if the shit hits the fan, you'll only lose a small amount of your portfolio, and the rest will go way up.  If things are fine, you're fine.  Not as fine as your peers, but fine nonetheless.",1230261493

I just think that cultism stems less from a blind devotion to the ""specialness"" of the computers, and more from a general appreciation of them. I think OS X is better than Windows, and I've tried a few times to specify why, but mostly it's a combination of a lot of little things that are all very good, rather than any particular feature which crushes Windows. (I don't use Dashboard or Spaces, for instance, haven't turned on Time Machine for a while, and I'm not a big Unix person, so the big crowed-out features aren't it. But I still am absolutely certain that the OS is better quantifiably.)<p>The problem is that it's <i>not</i> easy to explain. There's a logic behind it, but it's a difficult one that depends on a bunch of little factors rather than one big one. That gets interpreted as cultism and fanboyism, but there's more to it than that. And I don't think that ""special"" ever had anything to do with it. Apple doesn't sell ""special.""",1230261383
409921,comment,409774,409774,0,0,xayide,,,"Gold worries me these days.  It's gone up so much lately that I think it's overvalued.  Of course, I discouraged my husband from buying up gold when it was much cheaper a year ago for this same reason and he still hasn't forgiven me.  For a civilization collapsing catastrophe, I still think we're better off with the bags of rice and bottles of bourbon we hoarded instead.<p>I'm not a fan of index funds.  At the risk of going against popular wisdom, I think it's better to put your money in a fund that is actually managed by a financial professional.  Index funds follow the general market hell or high water, and even though their fees are generally lower since it doesn't take any brains to manage one, you'll never maximize your returns (or these days minimize your losses) with one.  The key phrase to look for is 'no load mutual fund'.  These funds will generally minimize fees at the time of your deposit and withdrawl.  I've been happy with the Muhlenkamp Fund overall, of course they're in the gutter like everyone else at the moment.<p>The thing to remember is that the price of both gold and funds will fluctuate, and in either case you wouldn't be able to get at your money right away.  I keep an HSBC high interest rate savings account for emergencies.  There's enough money in there to pay my insurance deductibles if I crash my car into my house and both burn down.  I contribute monthly to pay my semi-annual insurance premiums plus a little extra to give me that deductible buffer.  It's probably around 2 months living expenses, which is within my risk tolerance, but you might want to sock away at least 3 months worth before investing the rest.",1230261291

O&#x27;Rourke wrote.<p>&quot;In the 2,500-year history of democracy since ancient Athens, a few politicians have arisen who more or less could be trusted with great powers, up to a point, briefly, in times of dire crisis, sort of.&quot;<p>Another of my favourites: &quot;
Individual politicians can’t save us either. Democracy means electing people. Politicians are the people who get elected. I’ve spent some time with politicians. I like politicians. I’m friends with politicians from both sides of the aisle. Politicians are fine until they stick their noses into things they don’t understand, such as most things. Then politicians turn into rachet-jawed purveyors of monkey doodle and baked wind. They are piddlers upon merit, beggars at the doors of accomplishment, thieves of livelihood, envy-coddling tax lice applauding themselves for giving away other people’s money. They are lapdogs of demagoguery returning to the vomit of collectivism. They are pig herders tending that sow who eats her young, the welfare state. They are muck-dwelling bottom feeders growing fat on the worries and disappointments of the electorate. They are the ditch carp in the great river of democracy. And that’s what one of their friends says.&quot;<p>&quot;The American political system is like a gigantic Mexican Christmas fiesta. Each political party is a huge piñata - a papier-mâché donkey, for example. The donkey is filled with full employment, low interest rates, affordable housing, comprehensive medical benefits, a balanced budget and other goodies. The American voter is blindfolded and given a stick. The voter then swings the stick wildly in every direction, trying to hit a political candidate on the head and knock some send into the silly bastard.&quot;<p>I think Australia has managed to get by as well as it has in spite of it&#x27;s more recent politicians not because of them, along with some favourable economic circumstances, which the current set of silly bastards appears to be doing their utmost undo. I&#x27;m not so concerned though because not only are politicians generally incompetent they&#x27;re also mostly impotent and economics tends to exhibit some cyclical behaviour regardless of what this weeks politicians are up to.",1436709412

9873497,comment,9873140,9873377,0,0,shoo,,,"The &quot;extraction-economy trap&quot; comment reminded me of Jared Diamond&#x27;s book Collapse. It has a chapter titled &quot;Mining Australia&quot;, which starts like this:<p>> Mining in the literal sense -- i.e. the mining of coal, iron, and so on -- is a key to Australia&#x27;s economy today, providing the largest share of its export earnings. In a metaphorical sense, however, mining is also key to Australia&#x27;s environmental history and to its current predicament. That&#x27;s because the essence of mining is to exploit resources that do not renew with time, and hence to deplete those resources. Since gold in the ground doesn&#x27;t breed more gold and one thus has no need to take account of gold renewal rates, miners extract gold from a gold lode as rapidly as is economically feasible, until the lode is exhausted. Mining minerals may thus be contrasted with exploiting renewable resources -- such as forests, fish, and topsoil -- that do regenerate themselves by biological reproduction or by soil formation. Renewable resources can be exploited indefinitely, provided that one removes them at a rate less than the rate at which they regenerate. If however one exploits forests, fish, or topsoil at rates exceeding their renewal rates, they too will eventually be depleted to extinction, like the gold in a gold mine.<p>> Australia has been and still is &quot;mining&quot; its renewable resources as if they were mined minerals. That is, they are being overexploited at rates faster than their renewal rates, with the result that they are declining. At present rates, Australia&#x27;s forests and fisheries will disappear long before its coal and iron reserves, which is ironic in view of the fact that the former are renewable but the latter aren&#x27;t.<p>> While many other countries today besides Australia are mining their environments, Australia is an especially suitable choice for this final case study of past and present societies, for several reasons. It is a First World country, unlike Rwanda, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and China, but like the countries in which most of the likely readers of this book live. Among First World countries, its population and economy are much smaller and less complex than those of the U.S., Europe, or Japan, so that the Australian situation is more easily grasped.<p>(i&#x27;ve typed this out manually from my copy of the book, any stupid typos are my fault, etc)",1436709279

It involves websites, and it takes up about 10-20 hours of our time per year. It costs us about $150/mo to run and earns us anywhere from $1000-$2400/mo (probably $1,600/mo average). It&#x27;s earned around the same income for about 3 years, and before that it earned $400-$800/mo for most of time during the first 2 years.<p>We could continue working hard to increase the amount our business earns, perhaps until it reaches $8,000-$10,000/mo (very realistic, but would require about 2 man months or so each), but for some reason neither of us are ever excited to work on it. In his spare time, he&#x27;s busy doing his stuff (completely unrelated work), and I&#x27;m busy working on the next big thing (creating an SaaS, or at least trying to determine one to work on). It&#x27;s really stupid, because we have this boring thing that earns us huge returns on our time invested, and currently pays us nearly $1,000/mo each for doing basically nothing, but we somehow find every excuse to work on something more exciting with little monetary returns, or perhaps simply scratching our own itches.<p>I think the lesson you can take from this (which I clearly haven&#x27;t learned) is that you shouldn&#x27;t seek to &quot;create a SaaS&quot;, necessarily. Instead, figure out the path of lease resistance to the dollars you want, and don&#x27;t worry about the &quot;passive&quot; nature of it. You can automate things later, in theory. Worry first about finding easy money. It really is out there.<p>I know that money isn&#x27;t everything, but it is pretty important.

My observation is that people generally imagine disaster scenarios that do not come to pass when it comes to large traffic changes. Two short anecdotes to support the observation.<p>1) My wife and I visited Ireland for a vacation a few years back. Neither she nor I had driven on the left side previously. We drove around the southwest of Ireland for a week and a half w/o incident. Driving on the left side wasn&#x27;t really a big issue. Pulling away from the curb was the biggest challenge, but it became &quot;natural&quot; after a day or so.<p>It was much more difficult navigating very narrow roads with (it seemed) mere inches from a stone wall on the left and oncoming traffic on the right.<p>Our situation was helped quite a bit by our familiarity with driving standard and familiarity with circulars (rotaries). Either of those factors would have made the situation much more difficult if we weren&#x27;t.<p>2) Two years ago, several key roads in downtown Providence, RI (a state in the US) were switched from one to two-way. Everyone predicted a large increase in accidents. I&#x27;m unaware of any increase in accidents to date. Our largest traffic problems continue to be caused by road construction sites with poor signs, RI&#x27;s overall inability to communicate effectively with signs, and college students from non-urban areas who walk into the street w/o looking and under the assumption that cars will just stop.<p>Despite my skepticism of a switch to right side driving being a big issue, I fear that we won&#x27;t see it any sooner than we will see the US finally switch to the metric system.",1436707700

9873390,comment,9871341,9872380,0,0,kerkeslager,,,"Well, I see a problem with your approach (and Greene&#x27;s approach) here, which is that science doesn&#x27;t give you a &quot;should&quot;, at least not in a general sense. Science only helps us understand facts and processes.<p>If you have a goal you want to achieve, science can often tell you how to achieve that goal, that is, science can tell you what you &quot;should&quot; do, <i>if you have a goal</i>. And sometimes science can help you guess what your goals might be (because people often have similar goals).<p>This gives us some insight into these questions. We can ask, what&#x27;s your goal?:<p>> <i>&quot;If science tells me that I love my children more than other children only because they share my genes (Hamilton, 1964), should I feel uneasy about loving them extra?&quot;</i><p>This depends on what your goal is. Evolutionary theory tells us that most people want their offspring to survive and reproduce, and have no such goal for the survival of other people. So if that&#x27;s your goal, then you <i>should</i> love them extra. If that&#x27;s <i>not</i> your goal (and for some small percentage of the population it won&#x27;t be) that doesn&#x27;t give you any imperative, so there&#x27;s no basis for saying that you should <i>or</i> shouldn&#x27;t feel anything about your kids.<p>> <i>&quot;If science tells me that I’m nice to other people only because a disposition to be nice ultimately helped my ancestors spread their genes (Trivers, 1971), should I stop being nice to people?&quot;</i><p>Again, this fact only gives you an imperative if it relates to your goals. If your goal is to spread your genes, then you should be nice to people. If that&#x27;s not your goal, then Trivers&#x27; research doesn&#x27;t provide any guidance as to what you should or shouldn&#x27;t do.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that there are plenty of other goals for which science might tell you that you should love your children or be nice to people. Is your goal to have someone take care of you when you&#x27;re old? Then you should love your children. Is your goal to have a successful career and make lots of money? Then you should be nice to people.<p>The most interesting part of this, to me, is that it forces us to take responsibility for our ethics. Within this framework, when you tell someone that what they are doing is wrong, you&#x27;re telling them that it doesn&#x27;t fit with your goals. When a society makes laws against behaviors, they&#x27;re declaring that those behaviors don&#x27;t fit with the shared goals of the members of the society.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that there is no basis for forcing one&#x27;s ethics on others--often one&#x27;s goals require it. For example, it is my goal to live an adequately long, healthy, and productive, so I have no qualms forcing my ethic of &quot;do not murder&quot; on other people. And most people share that goal, which is why murder is illegal everywhere I know of.<p>There are a lot of different directions to explore this idea. The core, though, is simply that there&#x27;s no &quot;should&quot; without a goal.",1436707049

There is a general perception amongst the more conservative side of politics that renewables will indefinitely require heavy subsidies, that India and China will be an inexhaustible coal market and that the use of wind and solar energy will have unintended consequences (be it health or economic).

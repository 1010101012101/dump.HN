When I graduated, I had decided to go back and do a Ph.D. to be able to continue learning about cool stuff.<p>But I worked in industry several years before going back, and loved that too. I quit the Ph.D. program after one year, mostly because I liked working in industry better.

TV shows, given an almost unlimited time budget, have a nasty tendency to ramble unfocused all over the place, telling 20 stories badly as opposed to 1 story well.

The inability to move from place to place for employment, vacation, or recreation is, again in my opinion, detrimental to society's mutual respect and wellbeing, and leads to economic and cultural segregation.<p>But a pervasive public transit system, combined with cycling and walking, achieves that. What it doesn't achieve is the capacity to ship large items between arbitrary points, and a distinct comparative slowness when traveling long distances (vaguely defined).<p>And you could just as easily argue that the health of a society is degraded by the over-usage of what amounts to an isolating coffin on wheels. There are no opportunities to casually chat with a stranger (unless you carpool with different people, or yell out the window at stopped traffic lights) while in transit: only the endpoints of your trip matter for the cross-pollination you speak of. I would expect this results in zones of high quality surrounded by the mortar of low quality areas.<p>Incidentally, I picked up this book today: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Walkable-City-Downtown-Save-America/dp/0374285810"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Walkable-City-Downtown-Save-America/dp...</a> I haven't read it yet and thus cannot recommend it.",1366701013

5593715,comment,5592886,5592886,15,0,pbbakkum,,,"Very cool project! I'm glad to see this area is getting some attention. I did research in GPU databases a couple summers ago at NEC, if anyone is interested the project is at <a href=""https://github.com/bakks/virginian"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bakks/virginian</a> .<p>Some background mixed with some opinion:<p>This is an area still without a major commercial competitor and there aren't yet any such public product efforts as far as I know (IBM has a couple of researchers publishing on the topic). The difficulty is that really exploiting the GPU requires rethinking architecture from the ground up, including how your query plan handles parallelism, how your data is stored, and most significantly, how to efficiently move data to the GPU for processing. Most databases aren't partitioned nearly well enough to shoehorn GPU processing in on the backend, and it seems like the vast majority of recent database development has been around highly distributed systems and commodity hardware, eg Hadoop. A German company called ParStream has a DB that uses GPUs for certain indexing operations, though last time I spoke to them it sounded like there is much much more that can be done with GPU hardware.<p>In general, speedup is highly variable, and depends on the data set, indexing characteristics, data type (fixed vs variable length), individual query, etc, but its fairly common to see 10x speedups over optimized multicore query execution. Though the extreme parallelism of the GPU is responsible for some of this, in my opinion the big win there is just absolute memory throughput. Newer Tesla GPUs have a memory throughput of > 100 GB/s without breaking a sweat, while most CPUs are around 30 GB/s. If you can push data through your hardware that quickly, its easy to see how the GPU can have such an advantage.<p>The difficulty, however, is actually moving the data into GPU memory (1-8 GB generally) to exploit this throughput, which is a major bottleneck (some of my research was around doing this better). I understand that GPU direct disk access is just becoming a reality, which could make this easier. The holy grail, however, is a full-powered integrated server CPU/GPU. If both of these components had equivalent main-memory access and this architecture becomes cheap and commoditized, then GPU databases will immediately become extremely relevant.<p>I expect that there will be a serious commercial competitor in this area within 3 years, either in the relational data warehousing space (think Vertica) or closely integrated into MapReduce type execution. My guess as to the reason it doesn't exist is that 1) production DB development is really hard and 2) GPU processing is only a really big win for certain workloads, namely heavy analytical/research workloads over fixed-size data. As I said, if GPUs become commoditized in server hardware or fully integrated with CPUs, however, I expect this domain will quickly become extremely important. This is a very cool area and its common to see 10x speedups even with optimized CPU implementations.<p>Always happy to chat about this stuff, feel free to shoot me a message.",1366700971

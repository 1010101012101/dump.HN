They hire a consultant to deploy wifi and hook it up to random ISP. ISP is paid out of the grant.<p>2) Mid-range or high-end housing pays a small local provider $10-25 per unit per month to provide X Mbps on a 2-3yr contract.<p>Both cases remove the up-front cost. The former doesn&#x27;t care about managing infrastructure and the latter has outsourced it to the ISP.<p>For us, we try to avoid running new cable/fiber/cat5 because asbestos and cost, but we&#x27;re working off different assumptions. Your model has cost per unit at $600 and we aim for less than half that otherwise ROI is too far out. Fiber costs basically the same as cat5 but you can frequently reuse copper for 100BaseT if there&#x27;s a wiring closet per floor which greatly reduces the cost of running cable.<p>Right now we don&#x27;t worry about delivering more than 100M because most people we talk to care more about cost than speed once you reliably deliver 15-25Mbps (e.g. not over wifi, no cable/telco peering congestion BS/<10ms to google.com).",1423875270

My last 3 jobs (each better than the last) all came from recruiters finding me on LinkedIn.<p>2 years ago I was trying to move upwards in my career path. I had a good job, but boring and I could go weeks with doing almost no work. I was simultaneously considered a valuable employee while actually operating as fluff. I decided to move into the world of configuration management and &quot;devops&quot;. I spent a few months implementing puppet in our lab and in a few places. Then I updated my Linked with puppet experience. A few months later, I got an offer at a local university that was implementing Puppet. I figured I would work there a year and get really solid Puppet Experience. I worked there about 3 months, got much better with puppet, but hated the place. I updated my LinkedIn resume again with my additional Puppet experience (all my responsibilities at the new job were puppet/automation related). I instantly started getting calls. Then I landed an awesome job with a large service company. I loved that job, hated the commute.

If anyone wanted to produce a game without Nintendo&#x27;s permission, they would be claiming to use the word &#x27;Nintendo&#x27; without a licensed trademark, and therefore Nintendo would be in a position to sue them for trademark infringement. We figured out that with just a resistor and capacitor - around 1 cent&#x27;s worth of components - we could find out how to beat the protection. The system read the word &#x27;Nintendo&#x27; twice - once to print it on the screen at the boot up, and a second time to check if it was correct before starting the game cartridge. That was a fatal mistake, because the first time they read &#x27;Nintendo&#x27; we got it to return &#x27;Argonaut&#x27;, so that was what dropped down the screen. On the second check, our resistor and capacitor powered up so the correct word &#x27;Nintendo&#x27; was in there, and the game booted up perfectly.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-04-born-slippy-the-making-of-star-fox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-04-born-slippy-the...</a>",1423874132

If you don&#x27;t trust the runtime, then why would you trust the built-in zero&#x27;ing? I get the &quot;defense in depth&quot; argument, but it feels a bit like doing this:<p><pre><code>    {
      int a = secret;  // Get secret.
      assert(a == secret);  // Check &quot;a&quot; is actually that.
      a = 0;  // Ensure &quot;a&quot; is zero&#x27;d on exit.
      assert(a == 0);  // Just because.
    }
</code></pre>
And yes, I get that you can build this into the language so it&#x27;s not quite as ridiculous - you actually wipe tainted stack, for example.<p>But the point is: the runtime has an ABI and a machine model. Information is allowed to leak across function boundaries, beacuse <i>it doesn&#x27;t matter</i>. Without using the &quot;unsafe&quot; keyword, there are no methods of getting around the machine model and dipping into the underlying actual machine.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t have a &quot;safe&quot; language and runtime, it&#x27;s still of limited value. It protects against threats involving data or control flow corruption <i>after</i> key usage, and where there isn&#x27;t sufficient control of the program to perturb the secret-consuming functions. That&#x27;s more of an annoyance than prevention. On the other hand, it gave the programmer a false sense that it was properly wiping secrets.",1423873771

There is a big chunk of behavior that can differ from client to client without the network fragmenting and without bad consequence to the clients whose behavior diverges from the majority&#x27;s.<p>For example, clients have complete choice about which nodes to talk to and which received transactions to propagate. In fact, clients have complete choice about <i>all</i> functionality that depends on data that is not (or not yet) incorporated into the blockchain.<p>That&#x27;s why we have the notion of consensus-relevance. There is a lot of stuff in Bitcoin Core that simply is not consensus-relevant, and Bitcoin Core&#x27;s developers intend to continue to segregate the consensus-relevant stuff from the stuff that any client is free to make its own choice about. Yes, in the future it might be true that there&#x27;s a big kernel of code that every client needs to use, but that kernel will not be all of Bitcoin Core as we know it today.",1431453579

9533624,comment,9527072,9529689,0,0,themeek,,,"It all depends on time, though it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;ll do a dossier on the EFF unless something prompts it.<p>I will say broadly that their coverage of information sharing, surveillance law, and intellectual property is rounded down to their specific issues and narrow perspective - and these issues aren&#x27;t necessarily one-for-one mappings to &quot;what&#x27;s best for the internet/civility&quot;.<p>One example that comes to mind was their coverage of the recent Obama Administration Executive Order 13694 [1][2] where they dropped the international purpose and nature of the order entirely, as if the sanctions weren&#x27;t directed towards, and enforced by law, at actors in China and Russia (and Iran and smaller players) overseas.<p>Following Snowden - who truly did show that the NSA was surveiling hundreds of millions of Americans - the EFF&#x27;s speculatory, alarmist and misleading coverage of national cybersecurity and civil rights confused and angered a confused and angry group of people we would rather have engaged in deliberate and reasonable debate. Namely, despite how different in kind, scope, purpose and method EO 13694 is, the EFF reported on it with the tone of the Snowden disclosures and its audience associated the two.<p>I have spoken, too, with the EFF - and was disappointed both by their their inability to use PGP (even after suggesting it to others) and the way they engaged with the material I provided them. [I sent them evidence of a backdoor in popular software and an analysis of a possible convenient backdoor location for a popular hardware brand; they quietly acknowledged these reports but AFAICT did nothing with them - as a comparison when I sent similar material, using PGP, to cryptome they were immediately published.]<p>I should not have been so disappointed by what they did with the materials I sent to them: I did not understand at the time the scope of the EFF - that even their published matrix of trustworthy communication software was a stretch of their operating scope.<p>So this isn&#x27;t to rag so very much on the EFF. I think they have a role in advocacy and journalism and the legal landscape. I&#x27;m just not willing to invest my full and unquestioning faith in the reports of any interest group - for even those with good intentions are not infallible.<p>[Anecdotes only today, I&#x27;m afraid. :)]<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/whitehouses-new-executive-order-cyber-crime-unfortunately-no-joke"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/whitehouses-new-execut...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/01/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-engaging-significant-m"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/01/execu...</a>",1431453572

When I got it in the mid 90s, you paid something like $20/mo for 15 hours (it&#x27;s been a long time) and then paid something like $2/hour for every hour after that.  I ran up a $60 charge and then had to be much more careful about how much time I spent online.  Lesson: because aol was so expensive to use, it incentivized people to use raw internet which had much less content at that time.  But some local isp offered $20/mo unlimited use pricing.<p>2 - they basically missed the transition to broadband<p>Had they realized they were a content business that had to run access infrastructure out of necessity, I think they could have had a shot at owning the internet.

The WSJ organization says, you must pay us $28.99 a month for full access to this content. That&#x27;s the value they&#x27;ve placed on their content, that&#x27;s the price they are charging, and that&#x27;s what people should pay.<p>> The fact that they also make most if not all of the content available on a &quot;complimentary&quot; basis via Google suggests that they do value occasional visits from non-subscribers.<p>> However if millions of non-subscribers were to install a paywall avoidance app and access the full content on a daily basis, this would probably violate the spirit of &quot;occasional&quot;.<p>WSJ certainly deserves to set whatever price on their work that they wish, and they also deserved to be compensated according to the value of that work.<p>However, if the workaround is no more in violation of the &quot;spirit of occasional [visits]&quot; than this publisher practice is in violation of the &quot;spirit&quot; of web navigation.  That spirit is that users should not be discriminated against based on their navigation source.<p>Google search results should not be a representation of content that is not allowed to direct visitors.  If WSJ wants to represent to Googlebot and Google visitors that the content is open, then it should be open to direct visitors as well.<p>If I, a user, did nothing special to access the content, I should be able to pass on the link to a new set of users.

We are doing OK on accuracy - we do keep all approved versions in an archive.<p>The problems relate more to the plethora of ways lite can fail - I don&#x27;t have my full list in front of me, but as a minor example, deleting an entire bulleted item from a list leaves the bullet in place within the editor as normal text. It sounds nitpicky, but it really makes the documents look funky, and the formatting is very important to our people, so the content editors spend extra time reformatting documents, which is not ideal.<p>Nevertheless, I haven&#x27;t found a solution that does any better, and we don&#x27;t have the resources to reinvent that wheel (yet), so we do have lite in production... it just is one of our pain points.<p>And to be fair, lite is improving - our list of complaints is smaller than it was a year ago, and each new release fixes a few things.",1431452001

9533422,comment,9531822,9532445,0,0,cicero,,,"I&#x27;ve been programming for 35 years, and I remember when object-oriented programming advocates seemed cult-like. As it turned out, O-O is a very useful tool, but it is not the ultimate programming paradigm. Time has shown that the early adopters of O-O were mostly justified in their enthusiasm, but tended to overstate the benefits of the technology. The O-O naysayers had concerns about performance, which is an issue in some O-O languages, but one that C++ solved. They also had concerns that O-O was hard to understand, but that is something that has been mostly solved through education. These days, the expectation is that a good programmer understands O-O.<p>Today, I see similar reactions to leading edge technologies and languages that are difficult to understand, whether they be FP, Rust, or Haskell. Time will tell whether these things break into the mainstream as did O-O, C++, and Java. I personally think that Rust is onto something, but it is too early to know how much impact it will have on the mainstream. Who knows, 10 years from now, we may see a dominant OS and application ecosystem written completely in Rust that has a level of quality seldom seen today. Or maybe we will see some of the ideas in Rust incorporated into a future version of C++. Or maybe Rust and its ideas will prove to be too impractical and will fade away.<p>I hope to have the time to learn and use Rust soon, but I certainly understand those who prefer to wait and see. What I don&#x27;t care for is a knee-jerk reaction against something because it is unfamiliar.",1431451976

What do you get back? Maybe the morning standups are not beneficial for the team, and just distracts everyone? Maybe story points are not worth the overhead of agreeing on, allocating them, etc and your team can do just fine without them?<p>If some methodology doesn&#x27;t really stick to your team, maybe it&#x27;s an indicator that they are totally fine without it?

Hand-me-downs were no big deal. And not everyone drove a new car. The really well off drove Cadillacs. We got McDonalds or Pizza once a week, to give mom a break.<p>If you take the equivalent lifestyle today, things are much different. Homes are bigger and better equipped. Cars are nicer -- and just about everyone in the family of driving age has one, of some kind. Vacations are more extravagant. People eat out more. Clothes are stylish.<p>The middle and upper-middle class don&#x27;t aspire to the standard of living we had 40 years ago. Many of them would turn their noses up at it.

Marijuana used to be &quot;mom and pop&quot; businesses, often with legitimate businesses used as fronts.  More recently, we&#x27;ve seen more Mexican cartel activity which has increased the violence, among other things.<p>I now live in Colorado where I voted for marijuana legalization (though I neither use nor grow), but back home, the growers don&#x27;t want legalization because it would destroy their profits.<p>It&#x27;s a very interesting market to look into.  There&#x27;s also a show called Weed Country that follows growers in the emerald triangle.",1431450050

Its a moderately strong beta emitter and the range in water (close to human body) is about 2 cm or so.  There are probably no parts of your innards more than 2 cm from the nearest bodily fluid (blood or whatever).<p>Humans are surprisingly radioactive BTW.  We each have about a hundred grams of potassium happily radiating away.  An interesting technological challenge for a startup might be using purely passive radiation monitoring to detect humans.  For security sensing or something.  Maybe in a 100 years automatic supermarket style doors will sense humans radioactively rather than current microwave doppler and infrared systems.  Maybe.",1445374794

When does the US become a police state?<p>I see people claiming that because we can discuss whether we are in a police state openly, we are not in one. This is a mistake because it assumes the goal of a police state is oppression. Oppression is not the goal of harsh policing or surveillance. Oppression is the means to achieve the goal of political stability.<p>Oppression can be used to liquidate protesters which threaten stability, as it has been done in the US as well as many other places. Oppression can be used to squash unorthodox thought, as it was done in the USSR and East Germany. Oppression doesn&#x27;t have to do both of these things, though. Power is free to decide what items constitute the biggest threat, and how oppression should be applied to best mitigate that threat.<p>Openly using forceful oppression to prevent people from criticizing the government&#x27;s policies is likely to stir up far more bad will and instability than merely using oppression to protect physical assets via invasive scanning etc. It is not intellectually realistic to envision a 1984-esque police state where speaking out against Big Brother gets you black bagged. That is far too obvious, and far too simple for reality.<p>Our current situation is as real of a police state as it gets. If you live in NYC, you&#x27;re 24/7 surveilled via a multitude of vectors, even if you&#x27;re not suspected of any crime. The police are not accountable for anything, and allowed to conceal their methods and programs, even to your detriment. A police state.",1445374642

We have secret courts that authorize the killing of American citizens. We have National Security Letters, requiring people to do exactly as they&#x27;re told and not allowing them to tell anyone (in some cases even their lawyer) they&#x27;ve been served with one. Government agencies operate outside the bounds of the constitution on a routine and mass basis (NSA&#x27;s phone spying program was found to be illegal/unconstitutional) with zero repercussions to government employees and agents who violated the law.<p>It also defines this:<p>>An electronic police state is one in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record, organize, search, and distribute forensic evidence against its citizens<p>America is the poster child of an electronic police state.

Granite is quite radioactive, you know.  Some kitchen countertops are much worse.<p>0.1 uSv is also the generally accepted as the &quot;banana equivalent dose&quot;.  Bananas are a decent source of potassium, which aside from being an essential element is also somewhat radioactive.<p>There is no fixed accepted dose rate for flying.  More than a couple and less than a dozen uSv/hr is about as accurate as you&#x27;re gonna get.  Depends on flight path and altitude and who knows what all else.  The claim that its a couple minutes of flight is not all that far from the truth, more or less.<p>People who don&#x27;t really understand what they&#x27;re afraid of can&#x27;t rationally minimize risks anyway.  Perhaps the granite in a kitchen countertop or architectural decorative feature would increase cancer death rate by 0.0001% but cancer due to chemical catalyst contamination in a replacement laminate countertop MIGHT be ten times the cancer death rate of radioactive granite.  Or maybe not.<p>Assuming they&#x27;re telling the truth about the dose, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the radiation dose.  Its small enough to be measured but biologically irrelevant.<p>What is highly suspicious is a police state violating constitutional amendments probably isn&#x27;t very concerned with citizen health and probably feels no need to tell the truth.  I could see some PR guy claiming its only 1 banana-equivalent-dose or an hour sitting at a granite countertop or whatever because he knows its irrelevant, even if the actual dose is so high that passersby hair is falling out and they&#x27;re getting radiation burns because its an enormously higher dose.

10421634,comment,10418345,10418409,0,0,fpp,,,"Within the last 3 years a lot of UK government agencies and related organisations have learn the true MS Windows TCO the hard way.<p>It was not only the MS upgrade / new licensing terms & cost increases that hit some of them pretty hard, it was also the end of life for MS Windows versions (XP, servers) and that many have outsourced their IT services / departments to 3rd party providers like CapGemini, Accenture, CGI etc.<p>This year e.g. with the EOL of Windows 2003 server, we have heard the word &quot;extortion&quot; quite a few times too often with some of the agencies.<p>To start with, the migration of a MS Win 2003 server to e.g. MS Win 2008 R2 or 2012 can easily take 20+days.<p>Now multiply this with £1K p/d, plus 3rd party service uplifts, training etc.<p>When you look at a larger scale data-intensive agency (10k+ staff) you are talking 800-1k+ servers running MS Windows. Only a fraction of those requiring an upgrade - e.g. 70-100 - already means £Millions. The licensing cost within that are of course marginal compared to the overall TCO. What is hitting the hardest is that the 3rd party suppliers will treat the new OS versions as a &quot;different&quot; OS. Such migrations (MS 2003 server, like with XP to Win7) require that quite some of the legacy software running on those servers has to be upgraded / needs new service contracts / does not immediately run / has to be fully re-tested. Plus new HW of course (not included in above cost).<p>Similar can be said for the XP to Win7 upgrade. While there are some automation tools to test your end user application estate (larger agencies have / had 800+ &quot;standard&quot; applications installed) a good estimate for such a multi-year upgrade programme is in the region of £3-5M+ for 12-15k end user computers. Windows licensing costs within these figures are marginal (e.g. 5-10%) or even included within the new HW that will cost on top of this migration (est. £600 * 8-10k+ -> £6M+ computers over 3-5y). These numbers go up substantially if you are upgrading high-security environments.<p>These figures are for mid-size / larger UK agencies with annual IT budgets in the region of £200-300M+ - the largest UK agencies / government departments have £1B+ annual IT budgets. The situation with local government is completely different - they have to calculate with &quot;every penny&quot;, often have only a few £M annual budgets, not having these &quot;favourable&quot; MS licensing terms (heard about massive increases in the last years for local governments), are already overstretched in their other budget areas - as a result of IT cost increase they will often have to cut services elsewhere. FYI, MS is much better in this arena - as for example - Oracle. There was a case documented this year when Oracle sent a UK local government a £600M annual licensing bill (increase)- Oracle, after this &quot;shock therapy&quot; then normally negotiates & settles for a much lower sum. Oracle claims to have an almost 80% profit margin with these kind of &quot;licensing deals&quot;.<p>Hope these real-world figures help to better understand where the issues are. The main cost - IMHO - are with the way how IT is delivered & serviced (3rd party at very high cost), constant changes in licensing terms for smaller to mid-size organisations, application licensing for specific MS Win versions, end of life of core IT building blocks vs continuity and gradual upgrades. If only a fraction of these amounts go into improving (end-user) open source solutions, we will have a boost in usability & features with most of these solutions. Additionally in these cases those improvements can then be shared across all government agencies, in the UK & world-wide. In the moment each improvement or application adaptation is always charged for multiple times (within the larger gov.agency scenario often by the same 3rd party suppliers).<p>It would be great if someone in those government agencies would document these actual cost and Central Gov would collect this data e.g. for base-lining against e.g. Linux (there are e.g. already thousands of Linux / Unix servers running within UK government agencies).<p>As with the Munich example mentioned a few time in this discussion, the above numbers / ballparks would have to be used for true comparison as Munich would have had to upgrade from XP to Win7 and also face the whole server upgrade scenarios. Instead much lower MS upgrade costs have been used and most importantly - upgrades required to all the (end user) applications, forms, macros & services that would most likely also have been required within the MS Win upgrades XP -> Win7, are now being told as Linux specific cost.",1445373226

You can look at their patent applications.[1]<p>The overall system is described in their patent application #20120300593.  This shows the overall plan: focus big transmitting transducers tightly on small receiving transducers. This resulted in a patent, #9094111.  But to get the patent, they had to narrow the main claim to include &quot;a receiver communications device adapted and configured to send input to the sender, the input comprising a power requirement that causes the sender to change a dwell time of the sender on the receiver&quot;.  That&#x27;s not an essential component of such a system, so it&#x27;s not a broad patent.<p>There&#x27;s an application on beam-steering, #20140281655. That&#x27;s a known technology, and the USPTO has sent back a non-final rejection based on prior art.  But that tells us the plan - big phased array of ultrasonic transducers aimed at a tiny target.  Direct line of sight is necessary between transmitting array and pickup array.<p>How could they generate 155dB of ultrasonic energy? They applied for a patent on their transmit transducer, application #20140265727.  That has an image of the sending transducer.  It&#x27;s a piezoelectric device with a silicon membrane, with a vacuum behind it. (The vacuum in back is to avoid pumping half the energy back into the device itself.)   A &quot;thin film&quot; piezoelectric element makes the membrane vibrate.  Devices like that have been built before, and the USPTO accordingly just sent them a final rejection.  There&#x27;s no new feature there which allows generation of more audio power than existing devices.  So assume their device has performance roughly comparable to existing devices.<p>Here&#x27;s a product list from American Piezo, a commercial supplier of high-power air ultrasonic transducers.[2] Their highest power unit that transmits into air is 119dB.  uBeam is claiming 155dB. That&#x27;s 36dB more, or 4000 times as much power.  That device needs 30V into 2K ohms to power it, or about half a watt.  So uBeam&#x27;s transmitter would need about 2 kilowatts, comparable to a small clothes dryer, spread over a large number of transmitting transducers.  An array 64 square would do it. The American Piezo transducer is 16mm across, so the transmitting array needs to be about a square meter.  That&#x27;s a big transmitting array, with 4000 elements, each with its own drive electronics. All that energy, or as least as much as they can focus, gets aimed at a tiny target.<p>The parent article discusses the attenuation problem. This gets worse with frequency.[4]  Measured values of attenuation in air at 1MHz at 20C are between 160-165dB/m. This is huge.  1m from the transmitter, all the power is gone, used to heat the air.  uBeam wants to operate in the megahertz range, but no way will that work.  At 50KhZ, where most air ultrasonic systems work, attenuation is only 2dB/m. Their demo system (with about 1 foot range) used off the shelf 40KHz transducers.<p>This thing might work in the 50-100KHz range, with a rather large and expensive transmitter array, when the target device was facing the transmitter.  Safety remains an issue; if they actually built a 155dB system, they&#x27;d have a steerable ultrasonic welder.<p>They could potentially build a nice demo system. Build a meter square array of off the shelf transducers running in the 50-100KHz range and mount it in a large picture frame.  Cover it with speaker grille cloth, maybe with a picture silk-screened on so it looks like a framed picture.  Have it scan at low power until a cooperating device reports a signal. Then focus the beam and turn the power up to full.<p>It&#x27;s not going to be totally silent, because some harmonics will get through and some objects in the target area will vibrate with the ultrasonics and resonate at a lower frequency.  But it probably wouldn&#x27;t be noticeable at a noisy trade show.<p>You probably don&#x27;t want to be near the focus of this thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/patents/assignee/ubeam-inc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/patents/assignee/ubeam-inc/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.americanpiezo.com/standard-products/air-transducers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.americanpiezo.com/standard-products/air-transduc...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonic_welding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonic_welding</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.ndt.net/article/ultragarsas/63-2008-no.1_03-jakevicius.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ndt.net/article/ultragarsas/63-2008-no.1_03-jakev...</a>",1445373140

And it&#x27;s not because short code is a bad thing...when you find code that&#x27;s well structured and broken down such that no method/function needs to be long, it&#x27;s a joy to read. The problem comes when people learn the rule without learning the why behind it. And that leads to one logical function/method that&#x27;s huge and has now been broken down into many nested methods/functions simply to satisfy the &quot;none are long&quot; requirement. Now, as a reader, I&#x27;ve still got to keep the entire context of the method/function in my head, but I now have to jump all over the code to find out what the single, large method actually does. I&#x27;d rather have a single, 200-line code block to look at than this sort of jumble.<p>What developers need to learn is that short methods/functions are a consequence of good techniques, not a technique in and of themselves and that long methods/functions are not bad in and of themselves, but they indicate that it&#x27;s very likely that the developer hasn&#x27;t put the proper thought into separating concerns and ensuring that each unit of his/her code has a single responsibility.<p>Sorry to get on my soapbox, but I&#x27;ve seen this &quot;lesson&quot; make ugly code even uglier when programmers don&#x27;t understand the why behind the lesson.",1445372032

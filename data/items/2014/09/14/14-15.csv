The whole process, furthermore, reads like a dialogue between Gwern and the reader.

Since you probably don&#x27;t have much experience in selling software (services), just a small tip:<p>I read in your article that you offer a bit of support. If you manage get to make a deal with someone, do make sure that in your agreement you explicitly mention for how long you will offer support. Make it nice and short, like 3-6 months, perhaps just a few weeks.<p>If you are tired now, you will only become more tired if your support of the project goes on, and it will keep worrying you if there&#x27;s always someone who contacts you about things of your project.<p>If the amount offered justifies it, perhaps find out if your university can get you in touch with a nice contract lawyer that can go over the transaction for you, but don&#x27;t worry about it too much. There&#x27;s not that much can go wrong, as long as the agreement is clear that everything is supplied &#x27;as is&#x27; and the support is properly time-constrained and makes no promises beyond &#x27;best effort&#x27;, and especially if the other party is allowed to inspect the goods before receiving them, not much can go wrong.<p>If you are the worrying type, you could put the funds received in a savings account and not touch them for a year or so, so you&#x27;ll always have funds to settle any disagreement.",1410704120

And usually not their own government either. They don&#x27;t see any reason why anyone would want to subject them to surveillance.<p>Because of the shock and horror that people displayed when the extent of the Stasi surveillance was uncovered - at the time, even the most ardent regime critics tended to be surprised at the Stasi revelations.<p>It seemed impossibly paranoid for anyone to engage in the level of surveillance that the Stasi did.<p>Granted, technological progress have made Stasi level surveillance vastly easier, but I don&#x27;t think most people are even now accepting just how much data is being captured and analysed.",1410703946

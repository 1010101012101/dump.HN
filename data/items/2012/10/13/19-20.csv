The exclusivity thing is a bummer for US users for sure, but that will be short-lived, if my sources are correct.<p>I disagree about the lateness. That's dependent on the release of Windows Phone 8 by Microsoft. You may argue that the announcement a month ago was too early, but the counter argument to that is that Nokia is growing mindshare.<p>I think Nokia's big chance is the apps they're providing. No other manufacturer produces apps as useful as Nokia. We know Maps and Drive will now be available on all WP8 devices, but there's City Lens, free streaming music, Nokia Transport, Nokia Xpress...<p>Android was never an option for Nokia, given Nokia Maps. As we know from many sources, Symbian was dead in the water, and awesome as it is, the N9 wasn't competitive with iOS and Android (there being even fewer 3rd-party apps today than Windows Phone went live with).<p>As for one great phone not fixing anything for them? Not sure. It worked for Samsung. Sure, that doesn't mean it'll work for Nokia. But predicting where this goes is like predicting the weather. I've owned every smart phone of Nokia's starting with the 9000 Communicator, and ending with the N900. I'm optimistic.<p>Elop is playing a long game, and his strategy makes sense to me. The 920 will, by all accounts, be the most innovative device when it's released later this month.",1350158395

4649503,comment,4649461,4649461,6,0,ChristianMarks,,,"Alan Kay has been giving talks on this for some time. He says there is no equivalent of the arch of civil engineering in software development, which is at the architectural equivalent of the pyramids. Analogies like this are difficult to sustain, but one might argue that civil engineering has a head start over software engineering by a couple thousand years. Others might protest that macros and algorithms have been around at least as long. I think this misses Alan Kay's point that the Empire State Building took 3000 workers 500 or so days to build, and those kinds of coordinated efforts are unheard of in single software engineering projects. One could counter that many large programming incorporate the work of thousands of others in the form of algorithms, techniques and standards, but civil engineering is no different with respect to accumulated wisdom--over a somewhat longer period. Civil engineering does provide for coordinated efforts among thousands of construction workers on a single project.",1350158116

Yet, Nokia tried to kill it and in fact <i>still tries</i> to, because it does not sit well with their earlier strategy(Symbian) nor with the current one(Windows Phone).<p>Nokia was brought down by the internal issues between divisions, Symbian people fought against Maemo/MeeGo people and executives threw plans and requirements around at such pace that whatever got nearly finished had to be scrapped and the whole process began again. Add in other strategy decisions, issues with hardware(LTE not available, no-go for North American market) and fierce competition and it's not really surprising they've gone down at the pace they had.<p>Well, luckily there are people who still believe on what MeeGo and N9 were built upon...",1350158042

By now the average age must be over 60.  There must be about 50 people living there, though there were thousands a few generations ago when it was an oil town.

Dropbox does have a sort of version control but it only keeps files for about a month (and even then you wouldn't want to rely on it if you definitely wanted the files back!).

The impression I got of Symbian of that time was that it was painful to develop against. J2ME was less painful but very, very limited. Think no animation support, just bitmaps, and I have to write my own game run loop, collision detection, etc.... This was most probably due to the limited hardware of the time but nonetheless, it was primitive.<p>In comparison, iOS and to a lesser extent Android are basically fully featured OSs with mostly full exposed functionality. iOS gives you core graphics, opengl es, core text, core animation, grand central dispatch, networking, etc... Android gives you views, animation, background tasks, activities, intents, etc...<p>The distribution model was also broken. If you wanted something distributed, you had to basically go with a carrier. There were attempts at an app store but there were not successful.<p>Contrast this with the App Store, Google Play, and iOS enterprise development program where you don't have to go begging to a carrier to get your app distributed.<p>To summarize, Symbian was coming from a previous era and had no chance.

Food stamps, soup kitchens, etc.  Almost nobody in the US or any other first world country will die of hunger without options to abate it.  I wouldn't mind having everyone in a country just get a foot stipend from taxes though.  While I am traditionally libertarian, I have this strange thing about the fundamental belief one of the reasons we erect society and prosperity is to attempt to eliminate the inherent inequalities and mortalities born into our existence.<p>I live in PA, and I know there is an electric subsidy on households below the median per capita income.  I'm pretty sure if you went unemployed you could get an electric rate around 1 cent a kilowatt, which is around 20% the normal rate.<p>Healthcare is an outlier, in that if (by circumstances beyond your control) you need others to save your life, without health insurance you are basically getting a free bankruptcy card.  And there goes any credit for anything for a decade at least.  If your house is on fire, the fire department will come and attempt to extinguish it and save your life without footing you a bill.  Police don't charge you for their emergency services.<p>So should those whose houses burn have to pay the bill for firefighters putting it out? (fire insurance on the house is independent of it, and I mean that instead of everyone paying taxes to cover the costs of fires, individuals pay when they possess something firefighters need to be called for).",1350155398

Second, login to their services (which uses that same God password) is performed by downloading JavaScript (and perhaps HTML and/or chrome; I forget now) from their servers, which means that they can at any time choose to intercept as few or as many user passwords as they wish—or as someone with legal authority wishes them to.<p>> Had it not been proposed as a joke, I would already be looking forward to those Emacs-patches incorporating Webkit as the new embedded browser.<p>I thought that there was a serious effort to do that.

We estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals with logistic regression adjusting for matching factors and confounders.<p>Results: Fewer patients with PD than controls ever established a smoking habit. Among former smokers, those with greater difficulty quitting or using nicotine substitutes were less likely to develop PD, with the risk being lowest among those reporting “extremely difficult to quit” compared with “easy to quit.” Nicotine substitute usage was strongly associated with quitting difficulty and duration of smoking, i.e., most strongly among current smokers, followed by former smokers who had used nicotine substitutes, and less strongly among former smokers who never used substitutes.<p>Conclusions: Our data support the notion that patients with PD are able to quit smoking more easily than controls. These findings are compatible with a decreased responsiveness to nicotine during the prodromal phase of PD. We propose that ease of smoking cessation is an aspect of premanifest PD similar to olfactory dysfunction, REM sleep disorders, or constipation and suggests that the apparent “neuroprotective” effect of smoking observed in epidemiologic studies is due to reverse causation.<p>&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2014/09/12/WNL.0000000000000879.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2014/09/12/WNL.000000...</a>",1436794568

The bulk of the article raises entirely real issues.<p>Edit: I think the open source issue is this: if an AWS customer uses open source software (or, more simply, if an OSS project is hosted on OSS) how far up the user/employer/vendor/contributor chain does the non-assert clause reach? If I contribute to project X, which is hosted on AWS, do I become a party to the non-assert clause? What about my employer? What if I contribute to the project as part of my employment?

If a scientific paper finds a correlation between red wine and heart disease this may be interesting and important clue for scientific study but this is not enough to develop a model of nutrition and certainly not enough to recommend consuming red wine for hearth health. Plenty of people don&#x27;t realize this and you see articles &quot;red wine good for your heart&quot; - without a robust model of human metabolism/nutrition we just can&#x27;t make claims like this.

Look for abusive queries coming in and kill those, the temporary files will go away at that point. Based on the size of the files, simply looking for long running queries should be sufficient; if it&#x27;s the backend for a web server, it&#x27;s likely that the client and server have already given up on the query (or in the worst case, re-sent the debilitating query).<p>As stated by other users, truncating random files will cause more problems for MySQL than just restarting mysql. In fact, I&#x27;d recommend going in and restarting it now, to ensure that you&#x27;re at a good state. Failing over to your slave (you do have a slave and failover procedure, right?) is less of a headache than trying to identify what problems were caused by manually truncating these sort files.<p>Finally, have a look at Skyline from Etsy[1]; a trend monitoring tool like this would have alerted you when the ramp started closer to 1am, well before this was suddenly an outage event.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/etsy/skyline"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/etsy/skyline</a>",1436793140

My preferred model is: every piece of persistent (beyond a single method scope) mutable state is owned by an actor, and accesses to that state are performed by sending State values to that actor and receiving values back. The type system enforces that any state modification happens in the appropriate actor; since State is an ordinary value you can refactor safely without worrying that you&#x27;re changing concurrency boundaries. Monadic syntax (for/yield) makes it easy to compose state changes that should happen atomically, and since the call to actually perform the modification is explicit, it&#x27;s easy to see which changes are atomic and which are not.",1436792946

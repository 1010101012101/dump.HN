I would look into the hands-free Bluetooth speakers (meant for auto use) with a Wheelchair power to USB convertor (most likely the easiest would be via an auto 12V DC adapter). That way you can have a mic/speaker mounted on the wheel chair to control the machine as well (if you dont have a wireless mic already). Any Bluetooth device capable of being paired will work though. This will prevent someone going through your laptop while you are away. I actually have one I use on occasion at coffee shops called Bluetooth Screen Lock available on the App Store, but there are other free and low cost apps that do the same thing available. The on I use allows me to set the sensitivity so that it will lock after being about 6 feet or more away, and unlock when I am within that distance.

I&#x27;ve always appreciated Logic&#x27;s clean, well laid out interface (as opposed to say, Cubase) and its general sense of respect for the intelligence of its users.<p>Unfortunately it seems Apple has gone in the direction of Garageband-ifiyng Logic; pushing it towards amateurs who want to easily piece together their musical ideas from other people&#x27;s sounds. The interface is dominated by the flashy new features such as the &#x27;Drummer&#x27; and &#x27;Drum Kit Designer&#x27; which effectively let you combine a limited set of preset drum sounds with a limited set of preset drumming styles. The result is a similar &#x27;toy&#x27; feel to that of Garageband.<p>Professional tools for creativity afford the user the ability to manipulate, combine and repurpose them in as much depth and complexity as user can manage, so that they may seek out new forms, rather than just creating pastiche rehashes of existing ideas. It is apparent from the direction Logic has taken that it is no longer aimed at the professional market, but rather more to the &#x27;Prosumer&#x27; category, who aspire to be &#x27;Pro&#x27;, but who still need a lot of hand-holding.<p>The most displeasing change I&#x27;ve noticed so far is that the &#x27;bypass&#x27; button on each instrument and effect, which neatly fitted in with Logic&#x27;s formerly clean and understated visual style, has now been replaced with a large glowing on/off &#x27;light&#x27;.

The problem is the way segregated infrastructure is promoted: here in Ottawa, they have green circle signs with bicycles, as if to say &#x27;bicycles are allowed here&#x27;. This gives drivers the impression that bicycles won&#x27;t be on streets without the signs, and that they can be inattentive (dooring, cutting people off while turning, etc). All of our cycling fatalities locally come from driver inattention, not malice - even though it&#x27;s douchey to overtake aggressively, it doesn&#x27;t kill nearly as often as opening your door without looking.<p>I guess my point is that road cycling culture is a chicken and egg problem. If more people of all ages are riding, drivers will be more conscious, and it will be safer. If everyone stays constrained to the walking paths and bike lanes, the utility isn&#x27;t there ( because the lanes and paths don&#x27;t go where you want ), and the drivers get to stay oblivious.<p>Finally, your last point about the dual carriageway misses the point completely. Yes, people who like biking a lot are the &#x27;early adopters&#x27; who push for more radical social change.

Ultimately it seems very challenging to know why we have succeeded, but our brains are very capable of designing reasons in retrospect. It&#x27;s my understanding there are a wealth of studies that support this theory. In &quot;The Black Swan&quot; Nassim Nicholas Taleb goes into some nice detail on the topic. Basically, we create narratives that make sense. &quot;Our company was successful because of our culture&quot; - that sounds good, but who knows if that really was the cause. The solution is not to look at all the companies that were successful to see if they also had a similar company culture, but to look at the companies that failed to see if they also shared that trait. If they did, then that trait is not THE key to success. But successful entrepreneurs(/people) are very prone to create a narrative cause to their success, and attribute that cause to actions - instead of chance.<p>Have you learned more from your failures or your successes.

Such as:<p>Reusable tools - Q comes with a lot of reusable tools you can just drop onto a page, many with their own back end and they &quot;just work&quot; when you Q.activate the page<p>Not refreshing the whole page - Q has virtual pages loaded with AJAX and slots (content areas) to fill on the page. Q.handle(url) simply loads the url for example and activates all the tools for you.<p>Event system - you nee to be able to remove event handlers when the page is unloaded or a tool is removed<p>Integration with PhoneGap, jQuery, touch vs non touch environments, etc.<p>But the coolest stuff is the middleware. You can literally write apps that get objects like this:<p><pre><code>    Users.byId(uid, function(err, user) { ... } );
</code></pre>
and not care how it gets the user object. If it already cached it then it uses the cached version. If it already requested it, it puts your callback on a waitlist instead of sending again. When response comes back it calls all callbacks on the list. It also can do throttling, and batching of requests. And all the while you just have to use the construction above to get objects.<p>Oh and Q supports socket.io so if you have node running you can update caches via a push so they are almost NEVER out of date!<p>Furthermore a lot of the time your JS code has a functional programming character, such as &quot;wait until these objects are fetched, then do this&quot;. So just use this:<p><pre><code>    var p = new Q.Pipe([&quot;user&quot;, &quot;stream&quot;], callback);
    Users.byId(uid, p.fill(&quot;user&quot;));
    Streams.get(publisherId, streamName, p.fill(&quot;stream&quot;))
</code></pre>
You can even use it with any unsuspecting library since it produces callbacks you pass to this library.<p>So basically:<p>Virtual pages and tools you drop on them, set and forget<p>Model done via caching and realtime updates, query and no worries. Use Q.pipe to wait for some objects then do what you wanted to do<p>Connect everything together with event handlers<p>Boom your app coming together quickly.

The EFF&#x27;s argument is basically that these organizations&#x27; expression has been chilled by the general knowledge that their communications are being collected. Laird v. Tatum seems like challenging precedent to overcome: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_v._Tatum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_v._Tatum</a> (Court held that the fear that the army might cause some harm in the future with information collected pursuant to surveillance was an insufficiently concrete injury to support standing).<p>The Due Process claim is iffy because it does not seem that any plaintiff has actually been prosecuted pursuant to a vague legal interpretation. If some poor sap got prosecuted in a case involving that legal interpretation, that would be a much better basis for a lawsuit.<p>I hope they make some progress with this, but I&#x27;m not optimistic because of the standing issues.<p><i>As an aside:</i><p>I personally don&#x27;t think litigation is the best way to approach privacy issues.

Prior to the 18th amendment, the federal government derived 30-40% of its revenues from liquor taxes. The beer barons had paid off plenty of political types. The nation was full of Irish and German immigrants who loved to drink. Yet, in 1919, the Anti-Saloon league and associated lobbyists got the 18th amendment passed to ban liquor. It was an incredible political maneuver.<p>They didn&#x27;t accomplish this via litigation. They accomplished it via single-minded politics: Wayne Wheeler would lend the League&#x27;s support to anyone who was in favor of Prohibition, regardless of their stances on other issues. He drew on the Protestant community, anti-Catholic sentiment, and the womens&#x27; vote (the suffrage movement in the U.S. was heavily driven by the desire of womens&#x27; groups to ban alcohol). They had a singular, clear, if ambitious, end-goal: the banning of alcohol.<p>If people are interested in electronic privacy, I think there is a lot to be learned from the success and methods of the Anti-Saloon league.",1373999678

Over cases when it&#x27;s <i>incorrectly</i> implemented? That&#x27;s true for anything. Over cases when no policy is actually in place? That&#x27;s also true for anything that introduces some form of order, at least in the beginning. Compared to other PM techniques? Good luck implementing Agile in projects that require hardware design.<p>> You dont just need a good programmer, you need one with good communication skills, one that understands the business enough to work with it productively and one that is savvy enough about why tactical and strategic decisions are made.<p>Arguably, a programmer with poor communication skills, who does not understand what the system he&#x27;s building does and why it&#x27;s being done the way it&#x27;s being done <i>is not a good programmer</i>. It may be a good programmer from the perspective of the head of recruiting, or from the perspective of someone in accounting who sees the smaller paycheck they&#x27;re giving, but arguably not for someone who is interested in, you know, <i>the programs</i> that guy/gal is writing.<p>This perspective that focuses on the code churning aspect of a programmer&#x27;s work rather than on the problem solving aspect is typical of people who have actually not worked on a non-trivial programming project. The truth we all painfully learn in our first four or five years on the job is that writing code isn&#x27;t the hard part in programming (well, it is for those who made a wrong career choice...). Coding is the most visible and the least cryptic of the activities we do. To someone in a management position without any programming experience, it looks like the programming language and the technologies are the main obstacles to anyone becoming a programmer. Truth is, any idiot can write code.<p>> Programmer Anarchy presumes that everyone in the team is totally passionate about the projects success<p>I&#x27;d say programmer anarchy presumes that everyone in the team is totally passionate about <i>what they do</i>.<p>Just in the paragraph above this, the author argues that PA worked for Fred George because he had a team of good programmers -- but this is a methodology that won&#x27;t work for unskilled programmers. If the determining factor was actually passion about the project&#x27;s success, why would the level of skill matter? A poorly-trained programmer can be just as passionate about seeing a project succeed as a good one, especially if he&#x27;s just starting out and is a bad programmer as a result of lack of experience, not lack of raw skill. In fact, in my experience, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of poor programmers scoring high points on the passion thingie, simply because they tend to compensate their lack of programming productivity with really loud talking, and engineering skills with social skills.<p>Martin Jee seems to look at this with the eyes of someone who&#x27;s managing names on paper, not real people. There are factors that the waterfall model doesn&#x27;t put into play, like peer pressure and team solidarity. It also scores high points on other motivation factors like trust; good developers are skeptical to project managers whose methodology has more buzzwords than ideas -- and Agile&#x27;s thin, broad tent is a prime candidate for people who do that -- and more favourable towards solutions which they perceive to be closer to their actual job.<p>> You find that many other members of the team prioritise their private lives more when it comes to spending time in the office, or that their minds are somewhere else when they are sitting at their desks.<p>This is true of any project management methodology. Unless I&#x27;m missing something, waterfall also presumes people are actually doing work during their work hours. PA also doesn&#x27;t come with an increased number of work hours.<p>> With a central leader figure you also get one person who has staked the next part of their career on the success of the project and they become the driving force behind its delivery. Programmer Anarchy presumes everyone is their own leader, but again not everyone is like that. Lots of people dont want to take control or drive through the delivery, they just want to do a day job.<p>This is fallaciously presuming that every central figure is &quot;staking&quot; the &quot;next part of their career&quot; -- i.e. that every central figure&#x27;s purpose in life is to climb the corporate ladder. This is usually symptomatic of malformed meritocracies. <i>Everyone</i> in the team is staking their careers on the success of the project they&#x27;re working on; it is far easier to find scapegoats when you have prominent leader figures, and scapegoating is a fundamental component of the corporate ladder. But informal leadership can <i>functionally</i> provide some of the needed advantages.<p>I think the fundamental difference in view is this:<p>> I think the most powerful idea in Programmer Anarchy is the idea that programmers take personal responsibility for the success of each project<p>There is a <i>very</i> small set of products whose success depends more on marketing, sales or the IP lawyers than on the product&#x27;s technical merit. This is extremely small, confined to a handful of monopolized domains, more often than not with products that are <i>not</i> under serious active development, and while an investor might consider them successful, no self-respecting programmer would want to claim that as one of the high points of their careers.<p>For anything else, the success of each project preeeeeetty much depends on the product it aims to develop actually, you know, working as expected, which is obviously up to the programmers. This is true for any field: a well-financed real estate project will fail if the architects and builders come up with houses that crush under the weight of the roof, a heavily-advertised car that doesn&#x27;t start or breaks down every hundred kilometers because the engineers and workers didn&#x27;t do it right will not earn much income and so on.",1373999499

That is, an effective leader must be a jerk.<p>But there are lots of other companies that are successful where people don&#x27;t act like jackasses. For example, Google culture is anti-jackass, Googley means not being a dickhead. If you have a problem, explain what&#x27;s wrong calmly and coherently, it&#x27;s more efficient. Simply telling someone that they, or their code, is a piece of shit is not likely to be as efficient.<p>IBM is another, when I worked at T.J.

But I don&#x27;t believe good works earns you a pass from criticism of behavior. The founders of the United States are forever thanked for the Constitution, but that doesn&#x27;t let them off for being slaveholders.<p>I expect there will be some reflexive downvoting on this for criticizing the prophet, but honestly, Linus makes geeks look bad socially.

Do you even read?<p>The link claims that a group called Consumer Watchdog made those claims, and then goes on to describe a pattern of partisan attack by that group, preferentially against Google, including wild and implausible allegations.  Again, the majority of the column-space at PC World is casting doubt on these allegations.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re an NSA agent, mrschwabe, raking muck on innocents to cover up your tracks.  Can you prove that you aren&#x27;t?  How much money have they paid you?  Way to undermine the free market, you commie nazi!  Best case, there&#x27;s no money changing hands, and you&#x27;re a liar because you think it&#x27;s funny.  Worst case, you&#x27;re a traitor.  (Note: in case you got hit by Poe&#x27;s Law, this paragraph is satire of your laughable reasoning, not an actual accusation.)<p>If Google were in bed with the NSA, they wouldn&#x27;t be leading the charge against NSL gag orders, by successfully campaigning the feds to let them publish approximate numbers.  (Credit where it&#x27;s due, Calyx Internet is the bravest corporate foe of NSLs that I know of.  But after Calyx, I know of no company as active as Google in resisting over-surveillance and fighting for privacy.)  (Also, note that NSLs, despite the name, are more-associated with the FBI than the NSA, but my point still holds, because it&#x27;s fedgov surveillance.)<p>And Google&#x27;s just-this-week petition to increase transparency over FISA surveillance is also not consistent with favouring the NSA.  More broadly, Google has been trying to draw attention to this for years, but obviously cautiously, because it&#x27;s too easy for irrational crackpots to make the claims you made.<p>We don&#x27;t know for sure that Google isn&#x27;t doing horrible things.

Those character codes is what helps &#x27;em look for key words, and enables the opportunity to snoop.<p>So instead if we doodle our text [1] in free-form and in language/lingo of our choosing (augment steganography with raw data/images) then we are perhaps closer to making it difficult for the snooping algorithms to parse and detect the keywords these people bank on.<p>I have significant reasons to believe that OCR across all languages for 400BB mails a day is next to impossible with available technology today.

5884480,comment,5883790,5884434,17,0,jholman,,,"He&#x27;s slightly exaggerating, IIRC, but it&#x27;s conceptually correct.<p>Regarding the share structure, Google has two classes of shares, or maybe three by now.  Class C shares don&#x27;t get to vote, and I can&#x27;t remember if they exist yet (IIRC they were voted into existence a year ago, but only pending various hurdles that I think might not have yet been cleared).  Class B shares are worth 10x as much as Class A shares, for voting purposes.  Guess who owns most (all?) of the Class B shares.<p>Anyway, the various share classes are all a bit beside-the-point.  The real point is that when you add up all the <i>votes</i>, Larry and Sergey control a lot of them.  And then there&#x27;s Eric.  And then there are a few CxOs/SVPs with meaningful shares.  So basically a small group of people, who have led Google to its current state, are in control.  Other shareholders are just along for the ride.<p>On top of all that, Google has always warned potential buyers that they don&#x27;t give a shit about quarterly earnings, and they care about long plays and such, from the IPO forward.  If minority shareholders were to sue the company for lack of fiduciary care, I think this would go poorly for them.<p>You could look up modern SEC filings to have a more-detailed breakdown, but here&#x27;s a years-out-of-date summary I found with a few minutes use of... you guessed it.<p><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10440005-265.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10440005-265.html</a>",1371283639

From all that I&#x27;ve heard on the German media, practically all surveillance techniques they use to get at encrypted communications consist of compromising your machine and thus getting at the unencrypted data.

As we already had a Facebook group for the company it made sense.<p>This is not a tool to compete with LinkedIn. It is a tool that competes with e-mail/mail lists.<p>Somethings now make much more sense. From a security point of view, in a company over one thousand employees, it is easier to add or remove employees as they are hired or they left the company.\nAlso it is easier to share work content for a limited audience while using your private Facebook account in a more casual way.<p>The main problem is that people doesn&#x27;t have so much interest in checking what&#x27;s in there. We have already other communication methods like the old good mail. So &quot;Facebook at Work&quot; is just another one to add to the list.<p>If you add it to your phone - I have done that - you will get notifications as the usual app. One of the problems is that you also will get them on weekends or when on vacations. That is not ideal.<p>As any social tool it requires a lot of fine tuning and also to match the culture and preferences of the company.\nProbably it is a good move for Facebook taking into account cost/benefit, but it is never easy with social tools as Facebook competitors have seen in the past.",1454474434

These confrontations can be so profound and emotional that they leave a permanent impact on you. If you wrestle with the problems in your life, identify them as caused by ADHD symptoms, and commit to solve them while on LSD, you&#x27;ll end up being very motivated to solve them.<p>This experience can be as impactful as when people &quot;find god&quot; while struggling through something and then finally find the willpower to overcome it. Actually it can be more impactful; consider that a psychedelic user perceives that they are meeting with God and God is directly telling them what they need to change and how they need to do it, while the born-again Christian has only thoroughly convinced himself that his own will is actually God&#x27;s will instilled within him, via faith. The psychedelic experience is much more powerful and much less fragile than the religious experiences that we are used to hearing about helping people through hardships.<p>And ADHD is a condition whose effects can be entirely overcome through willpower.",1454474277

A close friend recently went to Mexico to do ibogaine therapy and she says it&#x27;s changed her life, mostly for the better.<p>They have actual clinics in Mexico where they hook you up to an IV of the drug (oral ingestion problematic for whatever reason) and assign you a trip-sitter who has two jobs: for the first hour or two, when the drug makes you ill in an ayahuasca-like way, they help you get through it, go to and from the bathroom, etc. For the second part, which lasts around eight hours, the trip-sitter just hangs out and chats with you.<p>According to my friend, it was an emotionally much deeper journey than ayahuasca, with much more pronounced long-term results.<p>Evidently it gets rid of a lot of your deep-seated emotional and psychological issues (specifically, she says she&#x27;s parted with &quot;a shitload of petty little grudges against random people&quot;), but it also, as she puts it, &quot;takes all of your armor off&quot;. For example she reports that aggressive drivers used to be a source of mild amusement, but now she gets very saddened and anxious when another driver gives her the finger and refuses to let her change lanes.",1454472496

Mine takes about 35 minutes to go from near empty to full if I use the supplied wall charger, and is substantially slower if I use most other things (though oddly, my Anker DC->AC 2-port USB-A charger is able to support rapid charging).<p>When you plug it in, turn it off, then back on.  Down at the bottom, near the fingerprint, it should indicate the type of charging you&#x27;re getting.  I&#x27;ve seen three modes, and I apologize for not knowing the distinctions, but they&#x27;re &quot;charging slowly&quot;, &quot;charging&quot; and &quot;charging rapidly&quot;.<p>Times are commensurate to the charge mode, and rapid charging is unsurprisingly quite fast.<p>Another thing that might be the case is if the OP is going from actual empty to full without turning it on, which should (to some extent) expedite charging as there is no discharge happening at the same time, maybe.",1454472284

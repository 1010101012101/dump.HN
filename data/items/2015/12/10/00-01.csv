Insofar as your financial mass distorts economic spacetime for everyone int eh vicinity, it&#x27;s not unreasonable that you will be asked to pay some of the costs of said distortion. If you stay in a hotel that&#x27;s only half-full and make your bed before you check out, would you expect your stay to be free? Probably not.<p>I&#x27;m being a bit tongue-in-cheek here, but your repeated claims that taxes are too high presupposes some objectively correct level of taxation. In the real world, what happens is that tiny poor jurisdictions set tax rates that would be economically unsustainable but for the prospect of attracting some huge international firm whose revenues are so big that even a tiny percentage of them is a lot of money for the poor jurisdiction, and the extra administrative costs of domiciling the corporation there are less than the difference between the unusually low tax rate and that of a more economically logical place for the headquarters, based on actual factors of production.<p>Why should taxes come down to the level of whatever the poorest country is willing to charge in order to attract itinerant capital? Why not (as we are sort-of in the process of doing) just deny market access to firms that don&#x27;t want to pay prevailing rates?<p>It&#x27;s not that I hate capital as such, but as an individual I have to pay some sort of taxes and my international economic movements are somewhat restricted, because of the basic fact that people can impose costs on an economy as well as contribute to it. I&#x27;m not enthused about paying taxes on the income I receive in return for my work product, but I recognize that there&#x27;s a <i>quid pro quo</i> here as I prefer to live in a civilized society and transact business using money rather than live in a cave and subsist on fish or something.

Bottom line I&#x27;ve seen <i>a lot</i> of promising AR technologies come and go.<p>My personal take on this is that they may indeed have some very good, if not revolutionary, display technology. <i>However</i>: The big, big obstacle to delivering credible AR is latency. Contrary to VR, true see-through AR needs to have total latencies (device motion --> display photon hits the retina) of no larger than 10 - 15 ms max. The reason is that in see-through AR you&#x27;re essentially competing against the human visual system in latency and the HVS is <i>very</i> fast.<p>Moreover the HVS is also extremely good in separating visual content into &quot;layers&quot;. Whenever two things in your field of view don&#x27;t move in perfect continuity with their surroundings (as it is when there AR content overlaid with latency) your brain will immediately separate them from one another, creating the impression of layers, and, in the case of see-through AR, breaking the AR illusion.<p>So right now I&#x27;m a semi-believer. Iff they can sort out the latency problem <i>and</i> deliver stable yet ultrafast tracking in a wide variety of conditions (also by far not a trivial problem) then this has a bright future.",1449707336

It also has a different, perhaps less clearly defined, meaning for you.<p>Again, it&#x27;s fine for you to disagree.  But to say that their definition is <i>wrong</i>?  That sounds both arrogant and childish.  More to the point, it seems unlikely that you are right that their definition is [objectively] wrong.<p>[Edit:  Where did Go come from?  It came from trying to solve the problems of working on ten-million-line code bases for a decade or two.  That experience gave them definite ideas about what &quot;simplicity&quot; means.  It&#x27;s fair to say that most people don&#x27;t have that definition.

I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try their headset out, but I know some people who have, and I haven&#x27;t heard a single bad thing about it. The closest metaphor I can think of is seeing a GUI for the first time or seeing a TV set for the first time. I&#x27;ve used almost all of the other technology on the market or in development, and nothing comes anywhere close to what Magic Leap has.<p>Not many people realize this, but Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Google, and everyone else is pouring millions into AR/MR technology. You only hear about Google and Magic Leap because internal R&D budgets aren&#x27;t public, but this is a huge area of research for everybody. A number of the largest tech companies have recently opened up small research shops in Seattle, Israel, and Cambridge, where AR/MR researchers have traditionally been based.<p>Proper AR/MR won&#x27;t revolutionize entertainment consumption. It will revolutionize all of computing, especially productivity.

Good AR/MR is a significantly bigger leap for computing than iOS and Android were over Blackberry, Palm, and Windows Mobile. Again, the best metaphor I can think of is the GUI vs. text-based computing.<p>Lastly, ML does have an amazing patent portfolio and a world-class workforce that would be a dream acqu-hire for any large tech company, but top-notch VC&#x27;s don&#x27;t invest in startups for their patent portfolios.",1449706544

I was meaning something more like this so that you can skip the quoting business entirely and have the visual hierarchy match the conceptual hierarchy:<p>Well, if it&#x27;s supposed to be compatible with all the HTML crap out there, and even most MUAs&#x27; broken encoding of plain text email, it might be hard, but in principle, I&#x27;d think this should actually be rather simple:<p>Simply specify an algorithm that defines how to segment a text/plain body into paragraphs and how to thus generate MIME object-scope IDs per paragraph (by simply numbering them) and use that same structure to provide UI elements per paragraph. Then, if the user writes a per-paragraph reply, generate a multipart/alternative body, with one text/plain part in traditional quoting style, optionally with format=flowed, and one alternative application/fancy-paragraph-foo part which contains in some sort of serialization format references to the message+paragraph IDs, that paragraph&#x27;s text, and the corresponding reply text. This way, a receiving MUA that doesn&#x27;t support application/fancy-paragraph-foo will display an ordinary quoted plaintext body, and also, if a communication partner uses different MUAs, you can still reply to an email sent using an MUA without application/fancy-paragraph-foo support and still have the feature work if the reply is then read in an MUA that does understand it. Also, including the text of the original paragraph makes sure you can still display a message sensibly when the displaying MUA doesn&#x27;t have the mail it&#x27;s in reply to - you&#x27;d just have to be careful to not misrepresent the authorship information as reliable.<p>> What if user A deletes the entire conversation they were having with user B, and user B replies to the deleted conversation [...]<p>* g * (is there any way to escape asterisks to their literal meaning?!)<p>Well, the rationale I&#x27;ve heard is that it&#x27;s easier to make sure new participants in a conversation can read up on what has happened so far ... which obviously would be solved far better by attaching a thread of message/rfc822 attachments when adding a new participant that the recipient could navigate using their MUA&#x27;s usual UI instead of having to read a close to unreadable unstructured mess of emails.",1449706315

It seems very reasonable to me to consider a raw HDFS as a type of NoSQL data storage mechanism, with other components of the Hadoop framework acting on top of it as query languages and other utilities.<p>Of course we can bikeshed all day and split hairs about the precise definitions, but in the spirit of pragmatism, I would absolutely put &quot;Hadoop&quot; as a form of NoSQL storage solution. In fact, I&#x27;d say the most distinct of the items mentioned is Redis, and Redis is the tool from this list that has use cases that tend to differ the most significantly from traditional RDBMSs (I&#x27;m thinking specifically cases where Redis is used as a buffering layer to help relieve congestion for a highly visited base data store).

While it&#x27;s definitely true, what makes it more awkward in Go is the necessity to translate back and forth between the &quot;traditionally typed&quot; and &quot;unityped&quot; dialects of the language. I&#x27;m not (only) referring to performance here, but ergonomics. Because javascript is unityped everywhere, a unityped implementation of those sorts of functions is natural, but because Go is mostly type-based, it is less natural and more boilerplate-y to pass and return `interface{}` everywhere. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s a good point.",1449705799

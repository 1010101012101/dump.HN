19523,comment,17947,18997,0,0,harb,,,"Well there are a couple solutions. One, you could tabulate votes based on the karma of the users. So someone with higher  Karma gets bigger weight. That will probably focus the discussionsa and submissions a lot. <p>Two, you could have interesting comments, based on people voting them up or down, and their replies. <p>Also you could do some kind of geomtric progression instead of linear, or combine that with the voter's own karma.

Only rebooting seems to fix the latter.<p>Anyone know how to solve either of these problems?  ",1178311772

19519,comment,19155,19278,0,0,Terhorst,,,"You're right. I do occasionally visit the site, but I normally don't, because it's all in my reader. <p>\nEven so, you get these benefits:<p>> An expanded audience.<p>As a blogger, I think this is your most important asset. Vastly more important than any money you might get from it. An audience is actual power, and besides: It's not who you know--it's who knows you.<p>> Word of mouth, because of the first point.<p>Even if this portion of your audience isn't looking at your ads, if they like what you have to say, some of them are bound to tell other people. These are extra referrals you would not have had otherwise.<p>This is important because growth by word of mouth is naturally compounded. Over a few years, I bet the difference really builds up.<p>\nNow, I don't have any numbers to back this up, but my gut says this stuff will end up earning you more AdSense dollars in the long run than trying to maneuver your audience into captivity.",1178311696

19515,comment,19443,19445,0,0,nostrademons,,,"+1 all the Subversion comments - I would never use CVS for new development nowadays.<p>Anyways, your question is really about directory layouts, so here's what I do:<p>I have everything in SVN, under a relatively standard webapp directory structure (eg. /src for dynamic code, /static for static content, /i18n for localization files).  My webroot is set to /home/www, with one directory per virtual host.  Inside these directories are symlinks <i>only</i>.  So I have /home/www/www.bootstrapacitor.com/static/images symlinked to /home/bootstrapacitor/svn/static/images, etc. For uploaded data, I have directories in /var/, so /home/www/www.bootstrapacitor.com/static/logos is symlinked to /var/bootstrapacitor/logos.<p>When I bring new code over, I just do a subversion checkout, and everything is automatically in its proper place.  Eventually I'm planning to write a webscript that'll auto-deploy to staging and production, ensure that any necessary symlinks are in place, and check for database compatibility, but I haven't gotten around to that yet.  I guess in the real long term I'll be ditching all webserver filestorage for a distributed filesystem like Mogile or Akamai, but that's way off in the future.",1178311355

8303684,comment,8303027,8303027,7,0,jrapdx3,,,"Fact is &quot;depression&quot; is among the most prevalent illness among humans, and a leading cause of disability world-wide.  It affects people in all regions though incidence is higher in industrialized countries for unknown reasons.<p>Part of the problem in talking about the condition is that the word &quot;depression&quot; may refer to a variety of feelings or behavioral states--in everyday usage it&#x27;s not a precise term at all.<p>But in the context of the article, I infer the issue is &quot;clinical depression&quot;, a very serious illness that has specific diagnostic meaning.<p>Distinguishing depression-as-illness from a passing mood, or transient discouragement is important.  It&#x27;s normal to have these moods at times of loss, high stress, etc., but <i>not</i> normal when it becomes persistent and affects thinking, energy, motivation, interests, or physiological rhythms.<p>As the article points out, suicidal thinking and action can be associated with depression.  The mortality rate of severe depression is high, on the order of 15%, a decidedly non-trivial matter.<p>One more statistic to point out is the cost burden of depression.  A very recent study estimated depression costs the US nearly $200 billion per year, more than cancer ($131 billion) or diabetes ($171 billion) annually.  Considering that a minority of patients with depression receive adequate treatment, we can surmise much of the high cost of depression could be reduced by earlier intervention.<p>Depression is a treatable disease, the majority of sufferers respond at least moderately well to medication and non-medication therapies.  Treatment doesn&#x27;t always work as well as we&#x27;d like, but the problem is not being neglected. Since there&#x27;s so much at stake, it&#x27;s an extremely active field of research; our treatment tools will get better.<p>The important message is depression is a real illness that can be and should be vigorously treated.  Ignoring reality does not make it go away.  No one is immune, not entrepreneurs, programmers, engineers, doctors, janitors, or the fabulously wealthy.<p>Let&#x27;s not continue to let a treatable illness turn into tragedy.",1410454709

Uber&#x27;s CEO recently said that Lyft wanted to be acquired by Uber but that Uber isn&#x27;t in an acquisition mode. That&#x27;s not too surprising.

Thornton, 646 F.3d 199 (5th Cir. 2011).) The court in that case observed that the delay between accusation and trial becomes “presumptively prejudicial” near the one-year mark.  It found no compelling reasons for the delay and noted that the defendant promptly asserted his speedy-trial right while the proceedings were pending.

8303669,comment,8297091,8300633,1,0,tachyonbeam,,,"Indeed, static analysis is generally rather costly. It&#x27;s usually a fixed-point computation that iterates over the code multiple times. You generally need to allocate many objects to keep track of facts the analysis produces about different instructions, which need to be propagated around. Running a general-purpose static analysis on this test program would probably be more expensive than what I&#x27;m already doing.<p>In the case of my minimalist test program, it&#x27;s easy to say &quot;well, ha! that&#x27;s obviously not an accessor!&quot;, but in the general case, it&#x27;s much harder. Consider, for example, that there could be load() or eval() statements in the code. That means invisible code you haven&#x27;t seen yet, and can&#x27;t analyze. Then consider a much more trivial case where you find this somewhere in the code:<p>function foo(o)\n{\n    delete o.a;\n}<p>Now, you know that &quot;o&quot; is very unlikely to be the global object... But can you prove that with absolute certainty?

I&#x27;ve also tested btrfs.<p>Why is ZFS better (IMHO):<p>+ Tooling. The zpool and zfs commands are clear, easy to use and well documented. btrfs e.g. has no way to get a list of files with checksum problems. Also automounting and setting flexible mount points as well as the whole zfs get/set concept felt like a really concise way to configure all aspects easily.<p>+ Architecture. ZFS uses merkle hash trees with multiple copies spread over the disk (ditto blocks). This means that disk failures likely won&#x27;t affect metadata and every possible disk problem is accounted for (except main memory). btrfs only uses crc32c and has 2 copies of the metadata tree on disk (but not spread over the disk afaik) or simple RAID1 in case of multiple disks. So in case of disk problems btrfs tends to corrupt faster. I&#x27;ve actually tested this and it&#x27;s almost impossible to corrupt ZFS metadata even with hundreds of bad blocks. btrfs tends to switch faster to read-only mode with bad disks.<p>+ Compression: LZ4 is slightly better than LZO<p>+ L2ARC/ARC - easy to plug in a SSD cache. ARC is better than the pagecache for most workloads.<p>+ It&#x27;s really fun to work with. A lot of good documentation. Dealing with btrfs felt very different...<p>+ RAIDZ(2-3) and copies=n for datasets. Both don&#x27;t exist in btrfs (yet).<p>Reasons against ZoL:<p>- Memory. I&#x27;ve got out of memory errors because ARC memory is not freed fast enough. Also ZFS hogs a lot of memory. At least 750MB to 1GB kernel memory with several disks. btrfs needs far less. There is upcoming work to fix the ARC out of memory issues through.. it&#x27;s on the roadmap from the developers.<p>- Stability. This also applies to btrfs but it&#x27;s not as rock-solid as ext4. Especially with broken disks and usage of advanced features you&#x27;ll run eventually into bugs. But the &quot;normal&quot; operations where 100% stable for me with ZoL.<p>- It&#x27;s not native Linux. You have some Solaris Porting layer modules and integration into the Linux kernel is not as tight as you may like it to be. E.g. cgroups based io throttling was not possible, last time I looked. This may change in the future but it&#x27;s work to integrate it and if e.g. the module does not not compile for a new kernel you are screwed.<p>- btrfs will be supported and be a default choice in 1-2 years in likely all major Linux enterprise distributions. SLES already made it the default. For most workloads ZFS is likely not worth it. At least it&#x27;s tough to sell against a default option.<p>- rootfs on a ZoL volume is quite a lot of work and difficult to get working. But this is largely a distribution problem.",1410454276

Your example proves the point:<p>> Let say you have two directories A and B to sync and both contain a file f but the one in B is more recent than the one i A. A consistent strategy would be to always favor the most recent file and end up with A and B containing the same f file that was the one being in B at the beginning of the syncing.<p>Yes, unless that&#x27;s not what the operator wants.

Naive set theory isn&#x27;t adequate to cover file operations. Files have sizes and dates, but members of sets don&#x27;t normally have these properties.<p>File synchronization isn&#x27;t necessarily a simple and blind union of two sets. Some synchronization operations require that files be deleted, others require that files be restored or provided if absent. Which is true is left to the operator -- he must decide.<p>Consider this example. Two directory trees, A and B, contain the same number of files, but some of the files have sizes different than the other. Does the synchronization operation copy files from B to A, or A to B? <i>The answer is that the operator must decide</i>.<p>Rsync, a popular file synchronization utility, can delete files, or not, depending on what options the operator selects. It also much be told which is the source and which the destination.<p>> Do you have a reference for the technical definition of sync that this fails to meet?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_synchronization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_synchronization</a><p>A quote: &quot;File synchronization (or syncing) in computing is the process of ensuring that computer files in two or more locations are updated via certain rules.\nIn one-way file synchronization, also called mirroring, updated files are copied from a &#x27;source&#x27; location to one or more &#x27;target&#x27; locations, but no files are copied back to the source location. In two-way file synchronization, updated files are copied in both directions, usually with the purpose of keeping the two locations identical to each other.&quot;<p>In the first case, algorithm must be told which is the source and which the destination. <i>The operator must decide</i>. In the second, the algorithm must know how to proceed -- are newer files overwritten, or are older files overwritten? <i>The operator must decide</i>.<p>Most people don&#x27;t understand this -- in all synchronization operations, the role of the operator is key to getting any desirable result.<p>In answer to your question above, the online definition I quoted above doesn&#x27;t allow for a simple union of two file trees, because <i>there is no such thing</i> -- the algorithm requires additional information, information provided by the operator.<p>In a two-way synchronization, if the algorithm encounters a file that is (a) not present on both systems, or (b) one copy is larger, or (c) one copy has a newer date, the algorithm cannot proceed unless and until the operator expresses a preference -- establishes the rules.<p>In short, there is no automatic file synchronization -- all examples require the conscious participation of a decision-maker.<p>Let&#x27;s say I have edited some files in a large, complex programming project. The outcome is successful. I want to synchronize two file trees to reflect the successful outcome, but with a minimum of file operations. Therefore I tell the synchronization program to copy newer and/or newly created files from B to A.<p>Next example. I have edited and changed a complex software project, but the changes are a disaster and I want to recover the original state, but with a minimum of file operations. So I tell the sync program to restore older files from A to B, and delete new files from B not present on A.<p>Neither of the above operations can proceed to a desirable outcome unless I give the sync program explicit rules.<p>Conclusion: There is no such thing as a union of file systems that doesn&#x27;t need to be told how to accomplish that end.",1410453746

8303573,comment,8303036,8303519,7,0,MCRed,,,"I haven&#x27;t worked in the Kindle division, but there is a huge cultural gulf between Apple and Amazon.  Apple is very much a software company (well they&#x27;re a design company that encompasses both hardware and software).  They care a great deal about getting software right.  At WWDC each year they have a session on how to do great software that illuminates a process that involves a lot of design and upfront work before you begin coding.  A process that virtually nobody does these days. (I say these days because back in the 80s this is how CS students were taught &quot;write your program out in paper before writing it in code&quot;.  Nowadays nobody barely thinks about their work before they start writing code, for the most part.)<p>This is the polar opposite of Amazon, which I worked for in the past.<p>Amazon is perceived as a high tech company but it is a retailer and its management is the management of a retailer.   Amazons engineering is overseen by non-engineers and the company culture is highly political and focused on making a show more than making a product.  Quality is the last thing they actually care about (when it comes to software.)   You get ahead at Amazon with press releases-- it never matters if your product makes no sense. (EG: Movie listings on amazon.com, mail-order catalogs, literally scanned, and posted to amazon.com, innumerable initiatives and features that were put up there getting someone a promotion, only to have the team disappear in the next quarterly company wide reorg and the result to just rot.)<p>This is why I would never buy a tech product from Amazon.  They really don&#x27;t give a damn as a culture, and any engineer who gives a damn will not survive long there (and will be punished).<p>Giving a damn about design and quality doesn&#x27;t play well with stack ranking.<p>What plays into stack ranking is kissing your bosses peers butts, playing political games and making splashy new features.",1410453522

The words &quot;abstraction&quot; and &quot;function&quot; are pretty-much interchangable, although we might use &quot;abstraction&quot; to specifically refer to a &quot;new&quot; function definition, like this:<p><pre><code>    \\x. x\n</code></pre>\nAs opposed to a &quot;calculated&quot; function, like the result of an application:<p><pre><code>    a b\n</code></pre>\nRegarding precedence, application is &quot;left-associative&quot;, meaning that<p><pre><code>    a b c\n</code></pre>\nis the same as<p><pre><code>    (a b) c\n</code></pre>\nAbstractions &#x27;capture&#x27; everything after the &quot;.&quot;, so<p><pre><code>    \\a. b c \\d. \\e. f\n</code></pre>\nis the same as<p><pre><code>    \\a.

There are two &quot;x&quot; variables, one per abstraction, although those abstractions just-so-happen to look the same. In other words, we could replace one of the &quot;x&quot; abstractions with &quot;\\y. f (y y)&quot; (known as an &quot;alpha conversion&quot;) but we can&#x27;t rename one of the &quot;f&quot;s without renaming all three occurences.<p>Regarding your last point, the only <i>semantic</i> values in lambda calculus are functions, so &quot;t&quot; can&#x27;t be anything else.

Yes there will be, most notably on webpages, for example those with box borders defined as &quot;1px solid&quot; lines. The lines will look fuzzy and unequal. Check the last image at <a href=""http://www.paintcodeapp.com/content/news/2014-09-11_iphone-6-screens-demystified/line.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paintcodeapp.com/content/news/2014-09-11_iphone-6...</a> : it shows a &quot;1 CSS pixel&quot; line rendered as 2 black lines + 2 grey lines (one of the greys is very, very light). Some lines will not be interpolated the same way: some will be 2 black lines + 1 grey line, some will be 1 black line + 2 grey lines, and the shade of the 2 greys will be unequal and will vary depending on their precise alignment on the 1080p physical grid. The end result is that some lines will look slightly thinner/lighter or slightly thicker/darker than others. Heck, on my Nexus 5 which has an even higher PPI (445 PPI) than the iPhone 6+ (401 PPI) I can still clearly notice this effect, when holding the phone at arm&#x27;s length (and I don&#x27;t even have 20/20 vision), when simulating the downsampling that the 6+ is going to have to do. I can do it by zooming out[1] to simulate an effective pixel ratio of ~2.61, which is equivalent to what the iPhone 6+ is really doing graphically (1080 physical pixels wide / 414 logical pixels wide = ~2.61).<p>Contrast this with most Android devices where it <i>is</i> possible to get pixel perfect rendering because most (but not all) of them use a non-fractional pixel ratio (1.0, or 2.0, or 3.0, or 4.0) and to my knowledge none do downsampling (though with thousand of devices on the market I am sure 1 or 2 obscure models do it).<p>[1] If you have a 1080p Android device with a pixel ratio of 3.0 (eg. Nexus 5, LG G2, Galaxy S4, HTC One M7, etc), you can simulate the downsampling of the iPhone 6+ by zooming out in your browser by a factor of 360/414 = 0.8696<p>Edit: I did NOT downvote you. I agree that for many apps it won&#x27;t be noticeable, but it will be in some apps. Many users spend a lot of time in the browser, and many sites use 1px lines, and they <i>will</i> be a distracting artifact (unless Apple implemented a special hack to interpolate 1px lines in the browser - maybe Safari bypasses downsampling and forcibly rounds them up to 3 physical pixels, but then what about other browsers?)",1410452383

Then I had my central AC unit serviced and the tech showed me little dots of mold throughout the inside of the unit in the basement.

So Apple focused on perfecting a 163PPI display material and then tended to use it on multiple products.  They&#x27;d do the same thing for the retina display material as well (I think at one point the iPhone and iPad used the same display material and it was just cut to different sizes in making the display)<p>Apple could do this because they work so closely with their display manufacturers and they care so much about fidelity.   It just happened that doing rigid multiples of the original display size was convenient for software as well.<p>However, displays have become more commoditized, especially retina resolution ones (at the time it was introduced, Apple was the only one shipping these kinds of displays in such volume) and Apple&#x27;s volume has only increased over the years.<p>So we&#x27;re seeing a shift to more commodity display production, I believe, because the commodity market has caught up with Apple&#x27;s standards.  Beyond 300 pixels per inch there isn&#x27;t much advantage to higher density.<p>But there is a huge advantage to unit volumes of a display also used in portable TVs or whatever.<p>The software cost of downscaling isn&#x27;t significant at this point so it is an economic change.",1410452106

People of color continue to be economically and socially disadvantaged, which plays into the negative perceptions that society might have toward them, which makes it more challenging to elevate oneself above such problems, which allows the cycle to repeat, generation after generation. So if a large portion of the population consciously or unconsciously sees a group as the lesser, then that perception reveals itself socially, legally, politically...that perception to some degree immutable on account of its existence. This simultaneously creates a counter-culture whereby the mainstream is rejected on account of the rejection it creates, which further feeds into the cycle of poor racial integration.

8303331,comment,8298766,8302367,2,0,vidarh,,,"First of all, note that I absolutely agree that exercise will matter a lot. I don&#x27;t agree that it will make a huge difference in BMR <i>for someone who maintains similar weight</i> though. What it will certainly do is simply burn lots of calories both through the exercise itself, and short term increase in metabolism, as well as increase your energy levels to a point where you may end up being more active outside of exercise too.<p>But about BMR: Lean body mass between two people of same height and weight can certainly make a difference, but people tends to overestimate how much of a difference it will make assuming weight stays relatively similar.<p>(Note that difference in lean body mass certainly can have very substantial effect when you ignore large differences in <i>weight</i> because that opens the door for much larger variations in lean body mass, but note that bronbron was explicitly talking about similar weight)<p>I&#x27;m an amateur power lifter. My lean body mass after abut 10 years of exercise is about 15kg higher than when I was pretty much the same weight but fat. If I&#x27;d stated lifting younger (I was about 30) or used steroids, or spent more time with a trainer early on learning the right way to train, I might have added substantially more, but people tend to overestimate how much muscle you can realistically add. My current weight and performance means I&#x27;m an advanced lifter, within the top 10% of gym goers easily.<p>I often see people think they need to add on huge amount of calories when they start exercising, but that&#x27;s rarely true. My average calorie intake to maintain my weight <i>including</i> what I burn during 3+ intense weight sessions a week, at a weight of 106kg is about 2400. That is not estimated, but measured by tracking weight + intake in detail over periods of weeks. Subtract my exercise and some other activity, and that easily puts an upper bound on my BMR of 2000kcal/day, most likely more like 1800. A lot of kids freak out when they see those numbers, because they&#x27;ve looked at stories about steroid filled freaks of nature that eat 5000kcal+ a day and think you couldn&#x27;t possibly add muscle at my intake...<p>Schwarzenegger during his career as a bodybuilder was about my current weight when competing several seasons (he was heavier when he was a power lifter), but he probably had another approx. 15kg of lean body mass where I still have excess fat (if only I could magically transform my stomach fat and shift it to my chest and arms..).<p>That pretty much bounds the lean body mass difference for someone at around my current weight to around 30kg. I&#x27;m sure you could find someone with less lean body mass than I had when I was untrained if you went looking for really sickly people, but I was <i>weak</i>; you couldn&#x27;t find many with more than Arnold without bumping the body weight up)<p>It&#x27;s fairly normal to estimate about 12kcal per kg of extra lean body mass. The difference between untrained me 10 years ago and trained me today then adds up to only about 180kcal. And between untrained me 10 years ago and Arnold, about 360kcal/day.<p>Of course that&#x27;s not nothing - 360kcal is a small/medium meal if you&#x27;re careful. But very few find themselves towards the top of that range, so a difference that large at the same weight is likely not common (I was <i>totally untrained</i> and extremely sedentary when I started training), and if you do, your exercise will tend to dwarf the difference in basal metabolic rate. E.g. one of my workouts burns in the 500kcal range; I end up burning about 200kcal more per day on average. A top level bodybuilder will spend 3-5 times as long in the gym as me every week, maybe more (and on top of that, you are highly unlikely to get remotely close to Arnold level physique without steroids). But note also that this is before secondary effects: When I exercise, I am generally more active outside of the gym because I feel more energetic. I&#x27;ll be more inclined to walk to/from the train station instead of taking the bus, or take a walk during lunch hour.<p>You can certainly find &quot;mass monsters&quot; amongst steroid using body builders today that have lean body mass way above that (e.g. Ronnie Coleman), but they are few and far between, and again the amount of exercise you&#x27;d put in makes the BMR relatively irrelevant.",1410451263

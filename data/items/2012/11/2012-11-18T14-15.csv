4800653,comment,4800245,4800245,1,0,FrankFrank,,,"The market does not work in objective economic ways. The market prices different stocks because of various different factors - the weights of which are continuously changing. IMHO, this phenomenon is well explained by George Soros in his FT lectures from 2009:
<a href=""http://www.ft.com/indepth/soros-lectures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/indepth/soros-lectures</a><p>Some good examples or this behavior:
- The run up in the overall market, and specifically in the Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) and the eventual crash was not based on good economics and lasted for several years.
- MDBX (MedBox) recent run up and correction is also a good example (TechCrunch, of all things, brought this to my attention)
- The recent drop in DDD (3D Systems) after a negative Seeking Alpha article, is also an example of how the market doesn't always behave in objective economic ways.",1353250630

4800645,comment,4800449,4800449,6,0,mjn,,,"I agree with much of this, and tend to be fairly ecumenical/pragmatic in my own choice of tools, but there are two things that lead to the ""identity statistics"" that are only briefly covered here, I think.<p>One is the entire philosophical debate, e.g. at least some Bayesians think arguments against the coherence of frequentist statistics are damning enough to make it questionable whether the methods should be considered rigorous statistics at all (admittedly this is basically the hardline view) [1].<p>The other is that it's not always agreed when it's appropriate to look for coverage versus to analyze beliefs, partly due to the philosophical debate, and partly because often what you ultimately want is a <i>decision</i>, and there are arguments for whether you should base decisions on frequentist-coverage machinery, or on belief-update machinery. For example, to move slightly afield from bounding a parameter, let's say we want an estimate of the region in which bombs are likely to fall. This can be formulated in frequentist statistics as a tolerance interval, with two decision thresholds, one for how many bombs we want to bound, and one for how confident we want to be in the bound: we want an interval that includes at least x% of the population with y% confidence, e.g. that with 99% confidence we'll bound 99% of bombs [2]. On the other hand, it can be formulated as a question about belief: essentially, we want to find the range in which we believe (for some suitably conservative definition of belief) we are going to find falling bombs, which Bayesian predictive statistics looks at.<p>[1] One famous/infamous such argument: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_principle</a><p>[2] I wrote a bit on why tolerance intervals should really be a more prominent part of the frequentist toolbox: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/tolerance_intervals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/tolerance_intervals.html</a>",1353250339

4800640,comment,4800245,4800245,3,0,Cookingboy,,,"It comes down to this: most shares of Apple are being held by large institutional investors, and they have guidelines on how much of their portfolio can be consisted of a SINGLE stock. Before the drop, Apple has grown almost 70% this year, which has made it a huge portion of a lot of investment institutes' portfolio. Selling some of the shares for a profit-taking and re-balancing of position is what happened next. That's exactly what happened back in May when the stock dropped close to 20% as well.<p>Now you may ask why it has dropped close to 30% this time? Simply because the market in itself was not doing well during this past month either. After the usual 20% correction, the market was hit with Obama's reelection, the fiscal cliff uncertainty, uncertainty on next year's capital gain tax increase, plus the usual end-of-year-profit-taking. So the correction went quite a bit further than those investment institutions have expected. That is why pretty much all analysts on Wall Streets right now are EXTREMELY bullish on Apple, since those fund managers will inevitably use this opportunity to restock (pun intended) their portfolios with cheap AAPL shares in the near future.<p>And don't listen to anyone who tell you Apple is ""over-priced"", right now it has a lower P/E ratio than Microsoft, so unless you really believe it has lower growth potential than Microsoft in the near future, the stock is quite undervalued. The stock has outgrown MS, Google, etc by quite a bit in recent years, but Apple's bottom line have grown by even more.",1353249868

They overload the purpose of the arrow keys which screws me over big time if I misspress slightly while trying to scroll down. The article I got moved to then switched to using the arrow keys to change between pages of the article, not between articles, and so I could no longer go back to the previous article. Even the back button on my browser was broken by their website and would just end up taking me back to the place that I was at. It makes reading so damn annoying; why do they do it? Wired even had it that if I accidently hit, say, right arrow and then tried to go back with the left arrow key it would 'forget' the fact that I had all the pages of the article open so I would no longer be able to see where I used to be.<p>Please don't make arrow keys do things!

4800636,comment,4800333,4800333,1,0,mattmanser,,,"I'm going to be honest, as not being defies the point of your post. You say it's for absolute beginners.<p>If this is something you'd like to do, you need to think of it from an absolute beginner's perspective.<p>The first post:<p>Why bother with csc. You don't give enough information to make it worth it. There's no mention in the first post of how the console works, how to open it, navigate using cd, etc. You don't tell them to create the new helloworld.cs file in the csharp folder, notepad++ will probably save to the user documents folder by default.<p>So if they even manage to open the console, they'll probably be in the wrong place and most of your commands will fail.<p>Even skilled power users capable of complex Excel, etc. will probably trip up on these.<p>Personally I don't even know why it goes into csc, which I've never used in 7 years coding c# professionally. Lots of books do this too, I just don't understand why! msbuild, yes as an advanced topic, but csc? Why would you self-compile or write C# without visual studio? Especially as you ask them to download visual studio.<p>You also don't tell them how to run the code. If they do notice the play button, it'll close as soon as they run it, as the consoles automatically close on run in the default debug mode, unless you ctrl+f5. That means no-one will see your program run unless you put a Console.Read() or Debug.Break() in there, which will be very confusing.<p>The 2nd post:<p>I feel the namespaces post is far too complex and is focusing on completeness in the subject rather that comprehension. All an absolute beginner needs to know about namespaces is that to use certain bits of built-in functionality they need to reference the dll and then use a using statement.<p>A new programmer's not going to be mucking around with namespaces, all their code will run in the namespace of their project. OTOH they will need to know they need to change the namespace if they cut and paste code though, to fix the problem that will inevitably occur because they've introduced a new namespace by accident.",1353249575

4800631,comment,4800521,4800584,9,0,gvb,,,"Agreed.  Historically, it has been cheaper to buy a high volume existing piece of hardware and throw away the pre-installed (and paid for) software than it is to build linux-oriented hardware.  The price breaks that come from manufacturing million of units simply swamps the cost savings of not paying for an unused OS (e.g. Windows, Android).<p>You can install Ubuntu on the Nexus 7 today. <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Installation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Installation</a>  The Nexus 10 will probably happen too.<p>Another interesting trick Canonical has talked about is Ubuntu on Android <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android</a> - essentially running a virtualized linux on the Android kernel.

I suppose that would fit?<p>I notice that some keyboard bindings[1] are different in ""Terminal""-mode (I suspect that means in terminal on GNU/Linux and possibly *BSD, but I suppose it might include MS Windows cmd.com (if supported) and OS X Terminal as well) -- as compared to the GUI-variants (MS Windows and OS X appear to just substitute control for command - while the ""Terminal""-variant uses e.g. meta-control-n, rather than just meta-n or control-n for new file).<p>I think I'll stick with VIM, thanks. Still having another powerful editor available isn't a bad thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://foicica.com/textadept/api/_M.textadept.keys.html#Key.Bindings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foicica.com/textadept/api/_M.textadept.keys.html#Key....</a>",1353248340

4800580,comment,4800394,4800394,8,0,larsberg,,,"I agree with his sentiment of ""integrate the tools more tightly."" In practice, though, that's pretty hard to do in a way that still lets third parties integrate easily into the IDE (I guess it's fine for Apple) because it results in very complicated APIs both in terms of their interfaces and semantics. Semantics (call M1 then M2; if you schedule filter F1 you need to call the old filter chain F1' even if you do nothing, etc.), btw, are where third parties really break IDEs. And then people blame Microsoft/Eclipse.<p>Further, scaling up nifty ideas to all programs and the entire development development process, both in terms of performance and interactions is hard. One guy on my team (I lead a team at MSFT for a bit) implemented ""Omniscient Debugging"" on steriods (you could also resume from the previous point in time) back in 2002 that we demo'd around, and it took many years to figure out how to build it in in a way that users could understand - happened long after I left.<p>We also had a full working IDE in web browser in 2001; more tightly integrated debug/edit/profile/unit test tools; etc. Fundamentally, though, many of these are user interface problems and it's much easier to come up with a spashy demo than it is to build and ship a real project that works with real code.<p>So, I'd say it's not that the ""PL community"" has been too focused on static code as separate from dynamic execution of the program, but rather that as IDE designers we don't (or at least didn't ~6 years ago) know how to convey the information to the user without requiring they use an IDE that looks like the cockpit of a 747.",1353247343

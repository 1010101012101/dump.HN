8281705,comment,8281511,8281511,3,0,kevinpet,,,"I think the game is the following:<p>1. Bukkit is GPL, developed without help from Mojang, but with a questionable use of the decompiled source.<p>2. Mojang likes Bukkit, hires some of the devs and buys name. And I&#x27;ll assume the these core devs would be willing to assign copyright to Mojang.<p>3. (Eventually) One of these core devs, now a Mojang employee, makes a new release of CraftBukkit, including Bukkit and linked against the Mojang official server blob.<p>Although the timing is different, this is exactly the situation with GPL libraries like Readline. You can&#x27;t use them in a proprietary product.<p>On the other hand, I suspect if this went to court, Mojang could argue that since that&#x27;s all bukkit ever did, and this dev contributed to it while that was the case, the license should be interpreted as including something like the classpath exemption, because it&#x27;s absurd to assume that people wrote code and distributed it but did not legally intend for it to be used in exactly that way.",1410109190

No, there were only three channels, and things were shown at one time, and you had to be watching then or you&#x27;d miss it, and you couldn&#x27;t watch it again. And it was horrible!<p>(Called my dad today, he was most amused too.)<p>This was provoked by having to explain to her that we couldn&#x27;t just get all of Season 17 X and Y, because it hasn&#x27;t all been broadcast yet, that there&#x27;s just a new one every week. And of course it&#x27;s unavailable in the UK ... except on the net.<p>She watches lots of CBeebies/CBBC. So I pay for a TV licence even though we don&#x27;t have a TV.

It uses deobfuscated, reverse engineered java code from the official server, and has never been given the actual source from Mojang. While Bukkit was sort-of folded into Mojang (They own the name, and a few of the developers went to work for Mojang), no one at Mojang is paid to work on Bukkit and they still don&#x27;t get source access.

Don&#x27;t want to think about how much I was carting back home that night. Hell, replace wedding with any situation - I have had to cart around a fair amount of money in general between my parents and their friends that are in a war with each other over gifts/paying for things, sometimes unknowingly when people stuff an envelope in my purse/bag or somewhere in my car and then only tell me after the fact. (If you&#x27;re Asian, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.)<p>- Me hauling ~$5k to go straight from my restaurant and bank across the street, to one of a couple of restaurant supply stores that offer a cash discount because they don&#x27;t want to deal with fraud and fees (and nor do I). It&#x27;s rare I buy a piece of equipment with cash, but sometimes it&#x27;s urgent so I go in person instead of ordering it online.<p>- The other day, dad was in the hospital and they wanted payment asap. I had been in a rush and I didn&#x27;t have my CCs on me only like $60 in cash and an ID, so I went to my restaurant and brought the payment over that was otherwise going to be deposited in the bank later that day.<p>Some of this is cultural though - older or still very Asian folks that like the feel of cold, hard cash. They&#x27;re a lot of small business owners with businesses that deal with a lot of cash on a regular basis too. So you know what some of the deal is ;)<p>Having dealt with $10k+ checks in general though, I almost want to just deal with cash but it&#x27;s just too easy to lose. I deposited a ~$50k bank check in my business account that took _three weeks_ to clear. As in, fully guaranteed by the bank funds.

The thing I&#x27;m trying to figure out is not only whether what happened was legal, but also whether what you did was, for lack of a better phrase, a dick move.<p>I can understand that hiring people can be difficult to get right. But if you ask someone to move to a different for you, if you decide it&#x27;s not right in the end, not giving them some sort of severance (even if it&#x27;s just 2 weeks pay) doesn&#x27;t seem like the &quot;startup&quot; thing to do.<p>I&#x27;ve only been on the employee side of the relationship, so there might be things I&#x27;m not seeing.

That money could be considered part of hiring costs, and the professional relationship could terminate as amicably as possible.<p>I don&#x27;t think you really get credit for &#x27;treating him with respect&#x27;, if (according to your description) you seem to have caught him by surprise by letting him go immediately.

Loaning him money to help pay for rent is cool, but should also have been a sign to you that maybe he didn&#x27;t have much money to deal with becoming jobless.<p>I can understand letting him go if he didn&#x27;t fit the team.

The relevant clause is below.\n- &quot;While we hope that your employment with the Company will be mutually satisfactory, employment with the Company is for no specific period of time. As a result, either you or the Company is free to terminate your employment relationship at any time for any reason, with or without cause. This is the full and complete agreement between us on this term. Although your job duties, title, compensation and benefits, as well as the Company’s personnel policies and procedures, may change from time-to-time, the “at-will” nature of your employment may not be changed except by an express writing signed and dated by both you and the President of the Company.&quot;<p>This was also explained thoroughly upon signing of the actual contract, which was a standard contract of full time employment within the Portuguese law, which includes 3 months trial period, by default. At the time we did not have our contract translated to English, which is why we took great pains to make sure everything was clear, but shortly after all the contracts were translated to English.&#x27;<p>While there are similar terms in the German law (6 months in most cases) at least in Germany it makes a really bad impression if people get fired while in the trial period. This is about one step above &quot;hellbanning&quot; the employee, since you can rely on the fact that the next employer where you apply, will ask lots of question if you were fired in the trial period. Thus if a company fires people unfairly while the employee was in trial, the employee has reasons to react really harshly.<p>I really don&#x27;t know how this is in Portugal, but if there is a similar culture, I can understand Andreas Wild completely.",1410107147

8281558,comment,8281486,8281486,7,0,nkurz,,,"This is a long but prescient 1974 article by Donald Knuth on the tradeoffs between readability and performance.  Following are some choice quotes to entice you to read the whole thing.<p>-------------------------------------------------------<p>I should confess that the title of this article was chosen primarily to generate attention. There are doubtless some readers who are convinced that abolition of go to statements is merely a fad, and they may see this title and think, &quot;Aha! Knuth is rehabilitating the go to statement, and we can go back to our old ways of programming again.&quot; Another class of readers will see the heretical title and think, &quot;When are diehards like Knuth going to get with it?&quot; I hope that both classes of people will read on and discover that what I am really doing is striving for a reasonably well balanced viewpoint about the proper role of go to statements. I argue for the elimination of go to&#x27;s in certain cases, and for their introduction in others.<p>...<p>[I]t seems that fanatical advocates of the New Programming are going overboard in their strict enforcement of morality and purity in programs. Sooner or later people are going to find that their beautifully-structured programs are running at only half the speed--or worse--of the dirty old programs they used to write, and they will mistakenly blame the structure instead of recognizing what is probably the real culprit--the system overhead caused by typical compiler implementation of Boolean variables and procedure calls.<p>...<p>At the present time I think we are on the verge of discovering at last what programming languages should really be like. I look forward to seeing many responsible experiments with language design during the next few years; and my dream is that by 1984 we will see a consensus developing for a really good programming language (or, more likely, a coherent family of languages). Furthermore, I&#x27;m guessing that people will become so disenchanted with the languages they are now using--even COBOL and FORTRAN-- that this new language, UTOPIA84, will have a chance to take over. At present we are far from that goal, yet there are indications that such a language is very slowly taking shape.<p>...<p>My own programming style has of course changed during the last decade, according to the trends of the times (e.g., I&#x27;m not quite so tricky anymore, and I use fewer go to&#x27;s), but the major change in my style has been due to this inner loop phenomenon. I now look with an extremely jaundiced eye at every operation in a critical inner loop, seeking to modify my program and data structure (as in the change from Example 1 to Example 2) so that some of the operations can be eliminated. The reasons for this approach are that: a) it doesn&#x27;t take long, since the inner loop is short; b) the payoff is real; and c) I can then afford to be less efficient in the other parts of my programs, which therefore are more readable and more easily written and debugged.<p>...<p>There is no doubt that the grail of efficiency leads to abuse. Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.<p>Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%. A good programmer will not be lulled into complacency by such reasoning, he will be wise to look carefully at the critical code; but only after that code has been identified. It is often a mistake to make a priori judgments about what parts of a program are really critical, since the universal experience of programmers who have been using measurement tools has been that their intuitive guesses fail. After working with such tools for seven years, I&#x27;ve become convinced that all compilers written from now on should be designed to provide all programmers with feedback indicating what parts of their programs are costing the most; indeed, this feedback should be supplied automatically unless it has been specifically turned off.<p>...<p>For some reason we all (especially me) had a mental block about optimization, namely that we always regarded it as a behind-the-scenes activity, to be done in the machine language, which the programmer isn&#x27;t supposed to know. This veil was first lifted from my eyes in the Fall of 1973. when I ran across a remark by Hoare that, ideally, a language should be designed so that an optimizing compiler can describe its optimizations in the source language. Of course! Why hadn&#x27;t I ever thought of it? [...]<p>The programmer using such a system will write his beautifully-structured, but possibly inefficient, program P; then he will interactively specify transformations that make it efficient. Such a system will be much more powerful and reliable than a completely automatic one. We can also imagine the system manipulating measurement statistics concerning how much of the total running time is spent in each statement, since the programmer will want to know which parts of his program deserve to be optimized, and how much effect an optimization will really have. The original program P should be retained along with the transformation specifications, so that it can be properly understood and maintained as time passes. As I say, this idea certainly isn&#x27;t my own; it is so exciting I hope that <i>everyone</i> soon becomes aware of its possibilities.<p>...<p>The Future<p>It seems clear that languages somewhat different from those in existence today would enhance the preparation of structured programs. We will perhaps eventually be writing only small modules which are identified by name as they are used to build larger ones, so that devices like indentation, rather than delimiters, might become feasible for expressing local structure in the source language. (See the discussion following Landin&#x27;s paper [59].) Although our examples don&#x27;t indicate this, it turns out that a given level of abstraction often involves several related routines and data definitions; for example, when we decide to represent a table in a certain way, we simultaneously want to specify the routines for storing and fetching information from that table. The next generation of languages will probably take into account such related routines.<p>Program manipulation systems appear to be a promising future tool which will help programmers to improve their programs, and to enjoy doing it. Standard operating procedure nowadays is usually to hand code critical portions of a routine in assembly language. Let us hope such assemblers will die out, and we will see several levels of language instead: At the highest levels we will be able to write abstract programs, while at the lowest levels we will be able to control storage and register allocation, and to suppress subscript range checking, etc. With an integrated system it will be possible to do debugging and analysis of the transformed program using a higher level language for communication. All levels will, of course, exhibit program structure syntactically so that our eyes can grasp it.<p>...<p>A great deal of research must be done if we&#x27;re going to have the desired language by 1984. Control structure is merely one simple issue, compared to questions of abstract data structure. It will be a major problem to keep the total number of language features within tight limits. And we must especially look at problems of input/output and data formatting, in order to provide a viable alternative to COBOL.",1410106257

The root problem is the required bridging overhead between the cross-platform code and the platform&#x27;s native runtime (the ObjC runtime on iOS; Dalvik/ART on Android). Using C/C++ for the cross-platform code is the lowest overhead approach on iOS, but it&#x27;s suboptimal on Android.<p>So why does this matter in practice? A few reasons:<p>Multiple coexisting memory management systems: In general, my understanding is that a garbage collector behaves best when all memory, or very near all of it, is under the collector&#x27;s control. My fuzzy intuition is that the least optimal situation is two coexisting garbage collectors, e.g. Xamarin.Android or a JavaScript engine other than Rhino on Android. But mixing a garbage collector with reference counting or manual memory management, such as with native code on Android or RoboVM or Xamarin.iOS, also seems to be suboptimal. If a significant amount of memory is allocated outside the scope of the GC, then the GC doesn&#x27;t have as much information with which to intelligently decide when and how much to collect. Also, in hybrid systems like the ones being discussed here, objects under the GC&#x27;s control sometimes have to be pinned so they can be accessed by the outside code; this interferes with copying or compacting collectors.<p>More information:<p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-tips.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-tips.htm...</a> (see the section &quot;Use Native Methods Carefully&quot;)<p><a href=""http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/advanced_topics/garbage_collection/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/advanced_topics/...</a><p><a href=""http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/memory_perf_best_practices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/applicati...</a><p><a href=""http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=360"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=360</a><p>Basically, having two coexisting memory management systems is messy. I&#x27;d rather avoid it.<p>Bridging adds overhead: Consider the cost of copying strings between the cross-platform component and the native string implementation, or mapping an array of cross-platform objects to a native array of wrappers so the objects can be used from UI code. There&#x27;s always some overhead for marshaling. Maybe it&#x27;s not much in practice, and I&#x27;m just being anal. But just knowing that it&#x27;s there bothers me. The best way to keep software fast is simply to minimize the amount of pointless crap it has to do. So it seems best to minimize indirection and overhead by having just one implementation of strings, collections, etc.<p>Heavy use of external functions obstructs whole-program optimization: The Android performance tips document referenced above mentions this in the context of JNI methods and JIT compilation. I imagine the same applies to ART&#x27;s AOT compilation, since the native methods are still opaque to the compiler, unlike the Dex bytecode. And for combinations such as Xamarin.Android or a JS engine other than Rhino on Android, there are two JIT compilers working suboptimally, because neither of them can see into the other&#x27;s world.<p>Hybrid setups thwart obfuscation on Android: It&#x27;s common for Android developers to use ProGuard (or its commercial big brother DexGuard) to shrink, obfuscate, and optimize their apps. Having a significant non-Java component in the app seriously limits the effectiveness of this practice.<p>Hybrid setups limit the usefulness of debuggers: If you&#x27;re mixing Java and native code on Android, or using Xamarin, RoboVM, or a JavaScript engine, can you get a single useful stack trace across the platform-specific and cross-platform components when something goes wrong, as it inevitably will?<p>So are we doomed to rewrite the same common logic in Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android, JavaScript for client-side web apps, and (C#|JavaScript|C++) for Windows Phone, if we want that code to integrate well with the host platform? Luckily, no.<p>RubyMotion has the right idea, I think, and there&#x27;s apparently an Android version on the way, but nothing for Windows Phone/WinRT or client-side web apps.<p>Another option is to write common code in Java, then use J2ObjC for iOS, IKVM.NET for Windows and Windows Phone, and GWT for the Web. Some teams within Google are doing this (minus the part about IKVM.net on Windows, AFAIK), including the team that developed J2ObjC. This approach certainly doesn&#x27;t have the polish of a commercial product like RubyMotion or the Xamarin tools. But on the other hand, all the tools are free, so this should appeal to cash-strapped indie developers. One thing I don&#x27;t like about J2ObjC is that the JRE emulation library has a larger footprint than I&#x27;d like. On a more aesthetic level, I don&#x27;t like the fact that this approach takes Java, which is designed to be a platform unto itself, and tries to make it work on other host platforms.<p>And then there&#x27;s RemObjects Elements (<a href=""http://www.remobjects.com/elements/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.remobjects.com/elements/</a>), a compiler toolchain with two language front-ends and three platform back-ends. On the language side, we have a choice of C# or Oxygene (a language based on Object Pascal). Either of these languages can be compiled to .NET bytecode, JVM bytecode (and from there to Dalvik bytecode for Android), or native code for the Objective-C runtime. (Note that the C# language front-end only provides the language; it doesn&#x27;t attempt to bring the .NET class library to the other platforms.) Each platform back-end uses the target platform&#x27;s preferred memory management system. That means GC for .NET and Java, and automatic reference counting for the Objective-C runtime. There&#x27;s a cross-platform standard library called Sugar for things like collections, date/time manipulation, making HTTP requests, and XML, but emphatically <i>not</i> UI. Sugar has a very small footprint; in fact, many Sugar classes and methods are mapped to their platform-provided counterparts at compile time. Like the Xamarin suite, RemObjects C# and Oxygene are commercial products, but the pricing is very reasonable. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying this toolchain on a real project, probably using the C# front-end.<p>I know this has been a long comment; it covers a topic I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot for more than a year. I know a lot of developers will just accept the added complexity and inefficiency I&#x27;ve described, for the sake of getting things done, i.e. accepting complexity and runtime inefficiency in exchange for developer efficiency. But then, added complexity translates to developer inefficiency at some point, especially when something goes wrong. And inflicting runtime inefficiency feels wrong when the machines in question aren&#x27;t ours. That is, the trade-off between programmer time and machine time is different for client-side apps than for server-side apps. Luckily, it appears we can have the best of all worlds, especially with the RemObjects products, at least if we&#x27;re willing and able to pay for excellent tools and accept that some of those tools will be closed-source.<p>(I guess readers will have to trust that this whole comment isn&#x27;t actually a marketing piece for RemObjects. I just discovered the RemObjects products last night, and they don&#x27;t seem to be well known, so I&#x27;m excited about them.)",1410105683

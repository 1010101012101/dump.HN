Every conversation has a frame of reference, a shared context within which it is communicated. Somebody has to frame that context, and I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with trying to be proactive about framing the context, as long as you do so in a way that is not disingenuous, deceptive, or manipulative. Controlling the narrative is not necessarily &quot;spin&quot; in this sense. It may be just seeking the truth. In fact, I have a hard time finding a better description of integrity in action that doing what you explicitly said you would do. How can you get any more straightforward than that?<p>The fact that it was said at the start makes all of the difference. It means that anybody who got into a relationship with Amazon knew at the beginning what kind of company they would be from an investment perspective. Amazon was setting out specifically to avoid misleading or deceiving anybody.<p>Even the kid in your example is not putting a spin on anything. He is being transparent and honest, not disingenuous or deceptive. To work within that analogy, as a parent I would have said that his attitude was unacceptable, because part of a parent&#x27;s job is to teach and help their child learn how to make responsible choices. I would encourage the child that I think they <i>can</i> excel at both and that I won&#x27;t accept a cop-out. If they <i>really</i> couldn&#x27;t do both, then I would tell them I appreciate their honesty and make them drop sports. The same should be true for Amazon. If people really had a problem with Amazon&#x27;s approach, they should not have bought stock in the first place, after Amazon told them plainly how they were going to operate.<p>That&#x27;s exactly the point: the parent knows ahead of time and can make a decision with full and accurate knowledge of the situation. People knew up front that Amazon would continue to invest the profits back into the business. If people <i>still</i> choose to invest, they have no right to claim they were deceived or manipulated, because Amazon was clear from the beginning. How is that &quot;disingenuous, deceptive, or manipulative?&quot;",1406339483

Ellis, the physicist-mathematician-cosmologist, an authority on the Big Bang and other cosmic mysteries. [...]</i><p><i>Horgan: Lawrence Krauss, in A Universe from Nothing, claims that physics has basically solved the mystery of why there is something rather than nothing. Do you agree?</i><p><i>Ellis: Certainly not.  He is presenting untested speculative theories of how things came into existence out of a pre-existing complex of entities, including variational principles, quantum field theory, specific symmetry groups, a bubbling vacuum, all the components of the standard model of particle physics, and so on. He does not explain in what way these entities could have pre-existed the coming into being of the universe, why they should have existed at all, or why they should have had the form they did.  And he gives no experimental or observational process whereby we could test these vivid speculations of the supposed universe-generation mechanism. How indeed can you test what existed before the universe existed? You can’t.</i><p><i>Thus what he is presenting is not tested science. It’s a philosophical speculation, which he apparently believes is so compelling he does not have to give any specification of evidence that would confirm it is true. Well, you can’t get any evidence about what existed before space and time came into being.  Above all he believes that these mathematically based speculations solve thousand year old philosophical conundrums, without seriously engaging those philosophical issues. The belief that all of reality can be fully comprehended in terms of physics and the equations of physics is a fantasy. As pointed out so well by Eddington in his Gifford lectures, they are partial and incomplete representations of physical, biological, psychological, and social reality.</i>",1406337928

Sometimes we make assumptions about a particular group of people and this poll seems like a great way to challenge those assumptions and take a closer look at who makes up the hacker news community. So....<p>How do you identify yourself spiritually?\n(Please comment if you choose Other.)",1406337551

You say that it&#x27;s fine because nobody gets hurt as long as the lie can be made good. The whole problem with lying (putting aside for a moment abstract moral ideas that it&#x27;s wrong in some pure sense) is that it eventually comes crashing down.<p>Sure, it all works out fine. Sales over-promises, engineering delivers anyway, the customer is happy. Until sales promises something that not only doesn&#x27;t exist, but can&#x27;t be done. Then you have a binding agreement to deliver something impossible. You get hurt because you&#x27;re now revealed as untrustworthy. The customer gets hurt because their plans are built on something that isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>I&#x27;m especially impressed that you&#x27;re unable to see the parallels with your own story. Much of your post boils down to, &quot;don&#x27;t lie (especially to yourself), because it eventually catches up to you&quot;. Yet here you are, saying that it&#x27;s perfectly fine to lie as long as it doesn&#x27;t catch up to you.

I&#x27;ve done it with five servers on AWS, and that was spatially indexing billions of GeoJSON polygons through storage while running queries against the index.<p>Many companies need far in excess of a million writes per second. Basically, most machine-generated data sources, whether it is personal location data or any other kind of telemetry. Many companies that do not generate that data themselves buy and consume it. I know of companies doing over a billion writes per second.<p>Cassandra is pretty good for this type of thing among open source software but it is not nearly as efficient as it could be in terms of write throughput. If the storage engine is correctly designed, you should be able to drive 10GbE all the way through storage -- call it 1 GB/sec per node. However, that does mean you can&#x27;t do things like mmap()-ing files; those interfaces are slow due to poor scheduling by the OS when the throughput is very high.",1406336556

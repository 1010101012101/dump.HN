10492067,comment,10490931,10490931,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"You have to be careful with articles like this. Most system design people work at large scale companies because they&#x27;re the ones who can afford them. But it&#x27;s a mistake to think that because something makes sense for Google or Amazon, it also makes sense for your small/medium business.<p>For example, cloud providers pay less for disk than you. They may even <i>charge you less</i> than it would cost for you to buy it yourself. But how much storage do you actually use? For most companies your entire storage budget is probably a rounding error in your cost of doing business. Amdahl&#x27;s law says if you&#x27;re looking to save money there you&#x27;re wasting your time, particularly if it comes at the cost of anything important.<p>Which it kind of does. Even putting aside the entire privacy debate, cloud storage creates third party dependencies. Put the only copy of your data on cloud storage and now you&#x27;re dependent not only on the cloud provider, but also their ISP and your ISP. If any of them has downtime, so do you. If the cloud provider loses all your data, they say &quot;oops&quot; and have bad PR for a while, you go out of business.<p>And as the article mentions, these numbers are idealized. It is possible to build a network that has a 2ms latency to cloud storage, but you have little control over that. I currently have a 28ms ping to youtube.com. And it&#x27;s not as if you can measure the latency and then make assumptions as if it will never change. If your ISP gets into a peering dispute you may go from 5ms today to 50ms tomorrow. If your ISP over-provisions its network tomorrow you may start seeing three digit round trip latencies when the network exceeds capacity. And it&#x27;s not as if you have much choice in ISPs if this happens; if you have any at all the alternative could be as bad or worse.<p>But probably the most important thing to understand is that the question is not even relevant to most people. With the amount of memory supported by even fairly old servers, your entire working set may fit in memory and make disk access latency quite irrelevant.",1446476242

10492058,comment,10486271,10486271,0,0,kefka,,,"Sigh. I will buy online for most things. Things I don&#x27;t: groceries, clothes. (Why: Our meat guy takes orders and we pay and pick up. Avg bill~$55. Grocery doesn&#x27;t have automated picking -krogers-. Would use it if we could.)<p>Now, why do I buy online? There&#x27;s many reasons.<p>1. I&#x27;m price sensitive. I don&#x27;t make that much, so my money must count. Doing X means not doing Y, even for small values of X. Online is just cheaper.<p>2. Your place doesn&#x27;t have what I want. I&#x27;ve went into electronics stores, looking for X. Except what I see is some version less and something much higher. Or they play with model names, where kwin-123xyz-tgt is at Target and kwin123xyz-wmt is at Walmart, and have no differences, other than a model ID that&#x27;s dependent on store, to prevent price matching.<p>3. Salespeople are idiots. I&#x27;ve had them try to &quot;inform&quot; me of all sorts of inane &quot;Its really true that...&quot; and other lies or mistruths. I don&#x27;t need your research, salesperson. Nor do I think you deserve your commission for your BS.<p>4. Salespeople are pushy (and worse; hard sell). Nothing turns me off from shopping than that behavior. I hate it, and will walk out as soon as they start engaging in it. One case I went back to them after making the sale and told them that their hard sell is why they did <i></i>not<i></i> make the sale.<p>5. Lines suck. As in, really suck. I have the non-choice of waiting in a too long line for some disinterested clerk to ring stuff up. Compare this to Amazon and other web stores where I can click buttons and &quot;BUY....DONE!&quot;. Yeah, there&#x27;s shipping. But I can get on with my day. Lines suck time I&#x27;ll never get back.<p>6. Other shoppers. We&#x27;re approaching the &#x27;Black Days&#x27;, where you will be neck-to-neck with other crazed deal-going shoppers. Some are in various states of unbathedness whilst many others are completely rude. The net eliminates this, completely... unless you go to forums like Reddit and intentionally find areas like /r/SRS<p>7. Going to another store = loads to time. I&#x27;m looking around 5 mins to park and walk, 10 mins to find, and 5 mins to pay, and 2 mins to leave. Total 22 mins. On the net, I can search a dozen stores at the same time. And nobody complains if I search another company while on the first&#x27;s web site.<p>8. I don&#x27;t get real-time reviews on items in store. I have to rely on the box (marketing), the ads (more marketing), and general feel if there&#x27;s a sample. Online, I can see the reviews of pretty much anything, can analyze trends in good and bad, and can make a generally informed decision.<p>9. Pricing issues. I regularly get problems with incorrect prices on things. Usually it&#x27;s taken care of, but turns out to be a big &quot;Stop registers, send someone to look, and report back&quot;. Retarded and inefficient.<p>10. Coupons/cards. I have an account on some eCommerce site. Or I use Paypal directly and not make an account. It just works. Versus the brick and mortar stores, where they play games with &quot;discounts, but not this way, and not here, but only on that with that&quot;. And you need those damned shopper cards. It&#x27;s one thing to have a single card, but every store wants you to have one.<p>That enough reasons why?",1446476119

If one side KNOWS you have the capability to pay more, then you&#x27;re at a disadvantage.<p>But really, a disadvantage compared to whom?<p>There&#x27;s of course the 99.99% [0] of people that simply can&#x27;t have this &quot;disadvantage&quot; because they&#x27;re not rich enough to &quot;suffer&quot; it. Given that the fact that the 0.01% will still be 0.01% after this terribly disadvantageous negotiation, it&#x27;s not really a disadvantage. I say &quot;fact&quot; because it is both expected from the qualities of exponential wealth distributions, as well as evidenced from the real world where there&#x27;s very little movement at the top.<p>Then there&#x27;s the specific party on the other side that KNOWS. They are of course part of the 99.99% too, so the same thing happens. Before the negotiation they are at a huge disadvantage compared to the ultra-rich, and after the negotiation they are roughly at the same disadvantage, except insignificantly less so.<p>Say I were to go on holiday to a country where cost of living is much, much lower than at home.

Men also don&#x27;t go to the doctor or confide in others for emotional support as much, instead opting to &quot;man up&quot; directly into a shorter lifespan than women.<p>Women egg men into this by overtly preferring brutish unexpressiveness as it&#x27;s &quot;more masculine&quot;, but at the end of the day it&#x27;s mostly men bullying each other starting from birth when this code is violated. Men are expected to rarely, if ever, dip into their emotional support structure-- this makes it largely useless. You&#x27;re just expected to deal with it, repress those emotions, and put on a brave face to carry on.<p>Aside from machismo and being discouraged from getting help from anyone, men are frequently burdened by the responsibility to provide for their family, which is considered their primary (only) purpose. If a man loses his job, it&#x27;s an affront to his worth as a human being. This is why middle aged men frequently kill themselves when they lose their job or are having trouble paying off their house; they suffer deeply and largely silently for perceived failures of manhood. The suicidal want an escape from their suffering, and as I&#x27;ve said before, there&#x27;s really no way for men to ease their suffering in an acceptable way.

It&#x27;s not a &quot;market failure&quot; because a fringe group of consumers are inconvenienced. You make this sound like an orphan drug.<p>Second, and more importantly, Dell, HP, and Lenovo are not free to combine and stand up to Microsoft. U.S. antitrust laws would shut that down immediately. In other words, government interference is contributing to this problem you&#x27;re lamenting. That&#x27;s not a &quot;market failure&quot; either -- it&#x27;s a political failure.<p>As to established, profitable companies &quot;having more options,&quot; as you say; it&#x27;s just as easily said that smaller, newer companies are more nimble and able to spot undeveloped, unsatisfied niches in consumer demand.

Facebook stock has a Price/Earnings ratio of about 70; that means that at the current rate of earning, it will take them 70 years to justify the value of the share price. There&#x27;s no way shareholders are going to be willing to wait that long. Strong market forces are pushing Facebook to quickly grow profits, and in that process, privacy just happens to be an externality that&#x27;s not worth protecting.<p>All employees will definitely feel the pressure (directly or indirectly) to contribute to profits, because Facebook management &quot;owes&quot; that to shareholders who&#x27;ve funded this whole operation (under current market ideology).",1446472825

There&#x27;s a lesson here to be had for all of us, which is that sometimes you&#x27;ve got to step back and let someone who isn&#x27;t as emotionally invested in the company as you take the reins, as you can end up doing extraordinary damage to yourself by acting rashly.<p>I speak from experience - I&#x27;ve been at this lark for a decade now, and have on more than a few occasions found myself sincerely regretting how I&#x27;ve responded to a situation, as I&#x27;ve ended up emotional and escalating the matter, rather than responding rationally and calmly. I recall literally pounding my head on the office wall - in front of an investor - painfully to this day. Childish.<p>We all mistakes, but we also have to learn when to admit our fault, and when to step away from a situation because we aren&#x27;t the right person to handle it.",1446472810

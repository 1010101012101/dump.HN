7466219,comment,7431209,7436794,1,0,ThePhysicist,,,"Well that&#x27;s an interesting website, but honestly I think it&#x27;s not possible to fund fundamental research using crowdsourcing: For example, the last group I worked in consisted of about 6 full-time researchers, 4 PhD students and about 3-6 master students / interns. The salary and infrastructure costs there probably already amount to more than 1 M$ / year. In addition, expenditures for electricity and other required materials (in our case liquid helium) amount again to several 100k$ / year. And this is just what keeps the lights on, doing actual research projects typically requires again several million dollars per project over the course of 3-5 years. To raise that amount of money through crowdsourcing seems very unrealistic and would put the scientists at the &quot;mercy of the masses&quot;, so with all due respect I think it&#x27;s not a viable idea.<p>There could be other interesting use cases for this kind of platform of course: I think in research education this could be a great tool to collect money for student projects at schools and universities, which in the long term will benefit science a lot by producing more scientists :) I just think that funding professional, institutionalized research is and should stay the job of the government.",1395759449
7466218,comment,7465078,7465858,4,0,MicroBerto,,,"Man this thread really has me wanting to get my personal blog going again.<p>First off, MJ recently discussed in his forum (which I no longer frequent, I like it here better) about how he had too much stuff, and was happy just hanging out in his GF&#x27;s small apartment.  So even very wealthy people can have these types of existential crises.<p>Now here&#x27;s my untested thesis that I&#x27;d like to blog about:<p>In the US, there was a study that shows something like &quot;happiness stops growing after 75k&quot;.<p>There are several reasons, but I feel that a large part of it is that once you have over 75k income, you start buying more things which end up causing you more problems.  That Mercedes that always needs repair?  That big suburban house that needs constant work?  Wife wants to go on vacations, pressure to have kids, etc etc.<p>So now you&#x27;re making 125k, but you&#x27;re no happier than someone making 50k.  Because:<p>* You&#x27;re working harder for the 125k<p>* You have more crap cluttering your life, and it keeps breaking and finding ways to abuse your time.<p>* You&#x27;re invited to more parties and social events, especially if you have kids.<p>YET, you&#x27;re still not making so much money that you can afford to have someone handle the small stuff for you.  So you&#x27;re awash in crap and tiny things and the next thing you know, you&#x27;re not doing what you truly enjoy.  you&#x27;re running errands.<p>So it becomes a Mo&#x27; Money Mo&#x27; Problems type situation.<p>* One solution is to live minimalistically.  Something I personally prefer.<p>* Another solution is to get rich enough and have an assistant, cook, maid, etc do the small stuff for you, so you can enjoy your time again instead of running errands all day.  This is also what I&#x27;m going after.<p>* A third solution is to move to a cheaper country.<p>Anyway, the point is, you <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to be rich.  But if you want the &quot;stuff&quot;, you&#x27;re going to get a hell of a lot of headaches that go along with it, unless you&#x27;re seriously ballin enough to not give a crap about hiring people to do the nonsense work.  Otherwise, you&#x27;re just paying for more work for yourself.<p>That&#x27;s my little offtopic thesis.  I need to get back to work now.",1395759415

There&#x27;s no legislating from the bench here. There was a law that was judged to be unconstitutional, so it got struck down. As it has in other jurisdictions for strikingly similar reasons. And that Random Internet Guy disagrees with a variety of federal judges on how to apply the rational basis test is interesting I guess, but you can see how I&#x27;d be unmoved.<p>The purpose of civil marriage is mainly to promote families. That being the way we insure the continuance of our society down the ages. Some people make their families in a way that is perfectly fine on outcome measures, but other people find squicky. My view, one with which the courts are agreeing, is that &quot;eeew&quot; is not a rational basis for excluding those people from the institution of marriage, because the 14th amendment demands (and our sense of natural justice requires) that people be equal before the law.<p>Of course, I am also on team gay, because I have gay friends and gay family members.

I mean, in theory parts of it are nice, but conflating it with the spam problem is probably not accurate; merchants will just pay for positive reviews for themselves and negative ones for competitors. I ask honestly: are there examples where this has worked?<p>eBay works this way [1], and I believe this is how Silk Road operated as well, although I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Merchants who pay for positive reviews for themselves and negative reviews for others have greater expenses than merchants who refrain from this, and, consequently, are less competitive.<p>Imagine a market place with hundreds or thousands of vendors (which is the size an established market place will grow to, if not much larger). Let&#x27;s say the average total sale volume per merchant is $10k (I think that&#x27;s a low figure). To nudge all your competitors&#x27; total review score 10% in the wrong direction you&#x27;d have to buy 1,000 * $10,000 * 10% = $1M USD worth of items from them, and leave <i>all</i> of them a 1 star feedback. Does this sound like an economically viable business approach?<p>Paying for positive reviews for yourself is cheaper than that, but you&#x27;re still less competitive than the merchants who actually satisfy clients, and don&#x27;t have to spend funds to increase their own rating score.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t combine this approach with something else, that might very well be the best solution. But I do think the best solution will require paying for reviews, in some way or another.<p>> I feel like the much better system is to increase the available information about transaction and/or review volumes associated with a particular account -- that makes it much easier to filter out bullshit, and mimics the way fakes are detected on the rest of the internet.<p>I think I would need more details on this approach to understand what you&#x27;re suggesting. How would you achieve this in a distributed system? And how do you get around the problem of vendors being able to increase their review score for free?<p>[1] <a href=""http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html#how"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html#how</a>",1395758823

Despite all this crisis taking place now, Greeks still live much better than 10 something years ago. All of that because of the EU money floating around. And that&#x27;s why the Greek majority still choose to stay in the Euro zone and play by the rules instead of parting on their own.

I volunteered to help pump out water and clean basements.  I did this in primarily two neighbourhoods.  A very affluent neighbourhood with multimillion dollar homes.  The other neighbourhood was middle class, 30-50 year old bungalows.<p>In the affluent neighbourhood, the neighbours all hated each other.  It seemed like at some point, everyone had done something to piss off someone else.  We set up a large pump on a driveway and were told by the neighbour that we had to move the pump since it was on their side of the driveway (which they were not using).  The neighbour also moved the 4 inch pipe into their neighbours garden which basically acted as an excavator until we noticed it.  It was actually upsetting to see in times of such crisis.<p>Other the other hand, and you likely can predict how this story will go, the middle class neighbourhood was full of community, helping hands and people willing to go out of their way to assist others.  It actually came to a point where there was too much help.  People were driving around with coffee and home made sandwiches which they couldn&#x27;t give out because 3 other cars with the same had just driven by.  People were thankful and would rush across the street to help you move a heavy refrigerator.<p>I realized over that week that if getting rich means hating your neighbours/being hated by your neighbours, having no one to reach out to, maybe I don&#x27;t want to be rich.  At least not financially rich.",1395758237

None of that requires me to be constantly &#x27;consuming&#x27;, but it&#x27;s still very useful.<p>In fact, For a full two years I had a smartphone (Nexus) with no data plan, and it was still worth having.

In a way you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s not GitHub&#x27;s fault, except to the extent that such interruptions seem more common than one might expect.  This is often what happens when we use web services to make something more convenient.<p>What&#x27;s important is that people should consider this downside along with the upside of greater convenience and operational simplicity.  Often they&#x27;ll choose to forward anyway.  More power to them and their providers.  OTOH, some would be better served by sticking with a truly distributed alternative.",1395757929

Its because programming languages really do matter.  However, experience with Java isn&#x27;t enough to have a wise perspective on Java and experience with Javascript isn&#x27;t enough to have a wise perspective on Javascript.  All languages aren&#x27;t alike and all languages aren&#x27;t equally good (even if Turing equivalent). University exposure to various programming languages is helpful, but programming in a language amongst other experienced programmers is more valuable.<p>I learned C while in grad school, but I really learned it at IBM while working on the Unix kernel.  That gave a useful perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of C.  So I can say that Java has some real advantages over C for certain kinds of work while C is the right language for kernel work.<p>Here, on HN, I&#x27;ve learned that Java programmers like programming in Java and that Javascript programmers love programming in Javascript.  But please don&#x27;t pontificate on how wonderful functional programming is in Javascript if you haven&#x27;t got a reasonable amount of experience with a real functional language (OCaml, Haskell, etc.).

Here&#x27;s my take on it:\nI switched from Windows to Linux over a decade ago...but as somebody that has to often write a lot of C/C++ code, man do I miss Visual C++. I&#x27;ve gone through all the IDEs (Eclipse, Code::Blocks, Anjuta, QtCreator, etc). QtCreator comes close for me, but I feel most comfortable with Sublime Text and a terminal for compiling/debugging/profiling.<p>Visual C++&#x27;s intellisense actually worked...not perfectly, but much better than what I&#x27;ve seen on Linux (QtCreator is close). Their debugger quality, source control integration, profiler integration, target code quality, compiler error messages/feedback, a call browser (a feature I still can&#x27;t find on any other IDE, not the same as grep)...all wonderful. All of that stuff can be leveraged for writing cross platform code, including the Linux kernel. I know it sounds insane to use a Windows-specific IDE, but VC++ is that good of an IDE. Personally I would think it&#x27;s way more trouble than it&#x27;s worth, but apparently the OP felt otherwise :)<p>I don&#x27;t have many good things to say about Microsoft&#x27;s products, but for Visual Studio I only have praise. MS has always excelled with compilers, languages, development tools. People mock Steve Ballmer for his &quot;developers, developers, developers!!!&quot; rant, but IMO MS&#x27;s dev toolchain is a big part of how they attracted developers and achieved market domination.",1395757900

7465909,comment,7465034,7465458,4,0,vidarh,,,"Jonathan Haidt touches on this in &quot;The Happiness Hypothesis&quot;, though not specifically applying it to TV watching.<p>There&#x27;s the standard issue of measuring happiness, sure, since it&#x27;s hard to find other than a self-reported subjective measurement for it.<p>But in general, the principle that what matters most to keep us happy is a steady &quot;upwards trajectory&quot; where things keeps getting somewhat better is getting quite decently researched from a lot of angles. According to Haidt, the studies he refers to in his book supports the claim that once basic needs (food, shelter) has been met, happiness deviates from a lot of what we people tend to think:<p>It is only mildly correlated with wealth, for example, and then largely because being wealthy allows for more opportunity for an upwards trajectory. However, people who suddenly come into wealth (e.g. lottery winners) report a lot of happiness for a short interval after winning, but then quickly return to &quot;base level&quot;.<p>And another example of the &quot;hedonic adaptation&quot; is that while mental illness such as depression can have a long term impact on happiness, but most other illness does not. Amputees, people with long term horrible chronic illnesses, people who are told they have only a few years left to live etc., that we often feel sorry for and assume will be miserable, all tend to return to base level happiness fairly quickly on average with the exception of those with degenerative conditions that put them on an ongoing downward trajectory. In fact, some groups will tend to be <i>more</i> happy than typical: Those who are slowly <i>recovering</i> from a horrible situation, and who thus see steady improvement in their situation.<p>With respect to the TV example, I find it quite plausible (with the caveat that I&#x27;ve not read the study either), as pacing in story-telling has <i>already</i> follows a pattern where you set up tension, release it and slows down the story, then set up tension again, for pretty much as long as people have been telling dramatic stories.<p>Pretty much all movies follow a pattern with &quot;tension release&quot; at least once or twice before the climax as well. I remember my English teacher drawing up diagrams of pacing a bunch of movies when I was in school even.<p>A perfect example of the alternative - to try to maintain an upwards trajectory as much as possible - would be Crank and Crank 2 with Jason Statham (though arguable even those movies cycle through periods with &quot;lulls&quot; in the action, just on a very accelerated schedule), which indeed tries to keep an insane pace throughout. In those movies it&#x27;s used as a gimmick (Statham needs to keep his heart going with drugs etc. in the first movie, and needs to keep an artificial heart charged in the second, with antics that in no way try to be realistic at any point), but when you contrast the start of the first movie with the latter parts of the second, you see the result: To make it feel like the pressure is &quot;kept up&quot; the pace keeps accelerating to absolutely ridiculous levels. It&#x27;s almost tiring to watch.<p>That ad breaks could provide some of the function in TV programs would thus not seem strange to me at all.",1395756422

What are these regulations? Are they government imposed or member imposed? What exactly do the regulations say? I wish the article didn&#x27;t just throw out &quot;there&#x27;s regulations&quot; without explaining what said regulations are and how they effect co-op lending.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of credit unions and they usually rank higher in customer satisfaction,[1][2] and tend to have better rates. They tend to be more community oriented. Though some credit unions can suck too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=842677&show=abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=842677&...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=855037&show=abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=855037&...</a>",1395756054

They let you establish a database that represents people as collections of identities across various services. These services could add a feature that discovers public keys hosted with keybase.io for your contacts based on proofs offered by the identities you&#x27;ve already mapped to each contact. This could be presented as a simple &quot;have key yes/no&quot; indicator, and symbols showing which service-identity pairs have vouched for that key, as well as warnings if any of the identities have vouched for a DIFFERENT key.<p>Obviously client-to-client is always best, but you could extend this model to cloud services, even email. It could provide an organic authentication layer.<p>Now, you can argue that it&#x27;s only as secure as your twitter / github / domain. Fine. But your twitter / github / domain ARE you on the internet. For most purposes, you&#x27;re just &quot;User X on Service Y&quot;. It can be useful to be able to prove that outside of Service Y. In addition, it&#x27;s really valuable to be able to have multiple &quot;proofs&quot;. An attacker would need to compromise four separate services to successfully spoof your identity (keybase, twitter, github, domain). That&#x27;s not impossible, but it is hard and probably slow, especially if you&#x27;re using two-factor authentication.<p>Finally, you can add additional out-of-band proofs. Hand-deliver a print out of your key to your associates, then they can pin that proof in the client and use keybase of on-the-fly verification, comparing everything to the key you provided them at your cypherpunk birthday party.",1395756031

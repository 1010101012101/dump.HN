What I thought was interesting was the discussion of all the variables that go into these predictions -- so many that I can understand why these predictions are often so far off.<p>Strength of the dollar, energy prices, Obama's stimulus package... Though my gut-instinct feelings on the first 2 are not particularly good, who really knows?

You might as well go for a Mac. I mean, all that tells me is that you care about how your lappy looks and not about what it does. Get a Sager for god's sake. you can configure one for about 1k and it will run better and last longer than any silly overpriced vaio out there.

My experience with high-end notebooks these days is that they can run basically anything -- fairly high end games, as many desktop apps as you can download, even Matlab runs pretty well on my laptop.

Sorry I assumed wrong...<p>If you're asking for anything 100% ""hackintosh compatible"" I don't know what to tell you. By 100% you mean pop DVD, install and go, no? Well, that's asking for a bit much. I have friends who have it running on dell and HP laptops all around. All took plenty of screwing around. And same goes for linux. If you can't deal with driver issues, you probably shouldn't be using linux...though you say you've used it for a long time. Are you just fed up now?<p>May I add that Wubi eliminates all those problems, and the slowdown is minimal. It really is, I used a wubi installation for quite a long time.<p>There is another option: install ubuntu with wubi, and then use LVPM.<p>here: <a href=""http://www.linuxhaxor.net/2008/12/06/graduate-from-a-wubi-install-to-a-dedicated-partition/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxhaxor.net/2008/12/06/graduate-from-a-wubi-in...</a><p>It even says ""Purely performance wise you wonâ€™t see much difference when you move from a wubi install to a dedicated install - considering that you have a fairly fast hard drive and that your windows partition is not heavily fragmented.""<p>Also, you have been checking dealcatcher.com and slickdeals.net right? there are a lot of sites out there with awesome deals on laptops that you can get cheap (and reliable).

I don't believe that this older group of people known as a faculty whom make up a department really give two shits whether or not their <i>words</i> and <i>methods</i> are really teaching me something or not.<p>This is a harsh generalization, but unfortunately as much as I don't want to believe it, I've found truer more often than not. Human communication is hard, it's even harder when your terms of agreement is in the form of a syllabus.<p>I don't mean to undermine some of the finest minds I've ever encountered in real-life, I'm just saying that more often than not, the people who <i>do</i> take it upon themselves to <i>know</i> is hardly worth the modern student's money or time. This is simply proven given what the web has become; I've made more meaningful connections by actively participating in what other people are working than I'll ever make in any formal arrangement for the rest of my life. The problem is in how we reassure ourselves, since we often rely on these tried-and-true techniques that aren't really measuring anything of value other than who originally did it and why. Self-directed learners don't fit into the modern University's model.<p>In short, I don't believe in universities because I think we don't have a <i>real</i> way to hold these institutions accountable given all the money we give them.

I have two of the ""dream"" machines you have mentioned: Thinkpad T61 and prev. generation Macbook Pro. Both are junk: Lenovo uses one of those el-cheapo dim and terrible colored screens and MBP also uses a 6-bit LCD albeit with LED backlight.

Please don't moan: I've learned to be <i>VERY</i> productive in Gnome+Compiz and while I like Macs, I highly recommend you guys check those out.<p>Back to the hardware: I keep jumping between the two. I wish I could just run Ubuntu on a Mac, but I absolutely need Adobe software for work: our designers as well as business people use Fireworks and Photoshop all the time, so I gotta be able to read and modify those files, so I'm trying to bear with OSX/Finder... Ughh.<p>I am also a photography nut and the situation with laptop LCDs is grim right now: the total degradation compared to what we've had 2-3 years ago.

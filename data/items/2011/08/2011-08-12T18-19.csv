2878704,comment,2877563,2877563,2,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"I'm sure that there is a lot of good material in that book, especially on core computer science topics.  But the book is only an 'introduction' since for many of the topics for serious interest in practice it will be important to go deeper than the book.<p>In places the authors of the book have bitten off more than they can chew well.  E.g., in linear programming they have:<p>""Gaussian elimination begins with a system of linear equalities whose solution is unknown.  In each iteration, we rewrite this system in a equivalent form that has some additional structure.  After some number of iterations, we have rewritten the system so that the solution is simple to obtain.  The simplex algorithm proceeds in a similar manner, and we can view it as Gaussian elimination for inequalities.""<p>NO!  They blew it!  That just ain't the point!  They failed to 'get it'!  They don't understand!  With liberal grading, they get a gentleman C- for effort!<p>They get a grade of B until they get to:<p>""we can view it as Gaussian elimination for inequalities.""<p>where they get a big red mark through their effort!<p>They emphasized the role of inequalities, but that is really trivial.  With no difficulty at all, we convert a linear programming problem with inequality constraints (<= or >= but not < or >) to one with (a) equality constraints and (b) all the variables greater than or equal to zero.  Fine.  But notice the part (b) where we still have some inequalities although some simpler ones.<p>That conversion was easy.  But it didn't do us any good at all for the main point of linear programming or the simplex algorithm for finding solutions since the main point is optimization, that is, doing good things for the objective function.<p>So, with the equality constraints, in the simplex algorithm, we proceed with elementary row operations.  Yes, each ""iteration"" is in terms of elementary row operations on a system of linear equations.  It is MUCH better to mention ""elementary row operations"" than ""iterations""(s) because the 'iterations' can't be easily justified but the elementary row operations can.  That is, there's no doubt that elementary row operations yield an equivalent system of linear equations; either we learned this well enough in high school or we can easily establish it ourselves in a few minutes.<p>Yes, so does Gauss elimination use elementary row operations.  But, for the simplex algorithm itself, directly, that's the end of the connection with Gauss elimination!<p>Why?  Gauss elimination, for numerical stability, should emphasize careful selection of the 'pivot' elements, e.g., as in<p>George E. Forsythe and Cleve B. Moler, 'Computer Solution of Linear Algebraic Systems', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs.<p>and the simplex algorithm of linear programming does not have that freedom or luxury.<p>So, each 'iteration' in the simplex algorithm is just an application of elementary row operations on a system of linear equations.  Nice to know this.<p>Next, and the main point of the simplex algorithm, which elementary row operations are selected?  That is, there is enormous freedom, and all the freedom would result in an equivalent system, so how to exploit the freedom?<p>Well, the authors omitted a step!  Once we have converted the given linear program with, possibly, some <= or >= constraints, to all equality constraints and all variables >= 0 (and all the right sides >= 0), we want an 'initial basic feasible solution'.  How do we get one?  We in effect just 'glue it on'!<p>So, if for some positive integer n we have n constraints, then we glue on, that is, append, n more variables, that is, n more columns, where the n x n matrix in the constraints is just the identity matrix.  These variables are called 'artificial'.  We (temporarily) modify the objective function:  We set each of the old cost coefficients to, say, 0 and the cost coefficients of each of the artificial variables to, say, 1.<p>What's going on with the artificial variables?  Sure:  The first question about a linear program is, does it have a feasible solution or not?  We say that a solution, that is, values for the variables, is 'feasible' if it satisfies the constraints.  It may be that there is no feasible solution; we want to know.<p>So, this work with artificial variables answers the question about feasible or not.<p>How?  The problem with the artificial variables is obviously feasible (before we appended the artificial variables, we multiplied some of the equality constraints by -1 so that all the constants on the right side were >= 0).  So, if we just assign the right side variable values to the artificial variables (the only way we can given that n x n identity matrix), then we will have a basic feasible solution to the problem with the artificial variables.<p>Then we apply the simplex algorithm to minimize.  We look at the resulting optimal value of the objective function.  If that value is positive, then the initial problem is infeasible.  If the value is 0, then the initial problem is feasible and we have a feasible solution for it.  With some inspection, we also have a basic feasible solution for the initial problem after dropping some redundant rows.<p>Also, easily we can put the original cost coefficients back where they belong in place of the 0s we inserted.<p>So, due to the artificial variables, we have a basic feasible solution and, if you will, an identity matrix that is the goal of Gauss elimination.  So, Gauss elimination can't really help us.<p>But some elementary row operations can help us, and they do, that's what we use, and that's the core of the simplex algorithm.<p>Now we address a crucial issue:  Looking at what are called 'reduced costs', it may be that they tell us that our present basic feasible solution is optimal.  If so, then we stop.<p>Else, we pick a variable not in the basis and ask what would happen to the objective function value if we (a) increased this non-basic variable and (b) adjusted the basic variables to maintain equality in the constraints.<p>Now we address another major point:  Looking at increasing the value of this non-basic variable, it may be that we can increase it all we want, without bound.  In this case we have just discovered that our problem is unbounded.  That is, assuming we are minimizing, we can save all we want.  Else, there is a maximum value to which we can increase this non-basic variable without driving one of the old basic variables negative and, thus, giving us an infeasible solution.  That is, increasing this non-basic value to its maximum value drives one or more old basic variables to zero.<p>So, we say that this non-basic variable 'enters' the basis and some old basic variable at zero 'leaves' the basis.<p>This calculation needs only elementary row operations.<p>So, each iteration of the simplex algorithm, actually including finding the reduced costs, needs only elementary row operations on a system of linear equations.<p>Then, the big point, the HUGE point, the main point about the simplex algorithm is WHAT elementary row operations are used.  The answer is, we use elementary row operations that, one non-basic variable at a time, improve the value of the objective function.<p>THAT'S what's special in the simplex algorithm and NOT that it's 'Gauss elimination on systems of inequalities'.<p>For more, geometrically, the feasible region is an intersection of finitely many half spaces and, thus, is a closed, convex set with extreme points, edges connecting pairs of extreme points, and flat sides.  Each basic feasible solution corresponds to an extreme point.  One simplex iteration, when it improves the value of the objective function, leaves its extreme point and moves along an edge from that extreme point.<p>It is possible to move from one basis to another with no change in the value of the objective function; in this case it is possible for the simplex algorithm to 'cycle', that is, return to a given basis infinitely often.  By being more selective about entering variables, we can avoid cycling.<p>If there is an optimal solution, then there is an optimal basic feasible solution; there is an optimal basic feasible solution where the reduced costs will show that the solution is optimal; and the simplex algorithm that does not cycle will find such a solution in finitely many iterations.<p>Once again, don't go to computer science people, not even the ones at MIT, to learn some applied math, not even applied math as simple, elementary, old, and beautifully polished as the simplex algorithm of linear programming.",1313175447

2878702,comment,2877442,2878020,3,0,jsnell,,,"> I think accusing someone of ""bordering on tinfoil hat territory"" is essentially a personal attack.<p>I was talking about the claim, not the person. I'm sorry for expressing it in a way that could easily be construed as a personal attack, that was in no way my intent. I still think that it's a totally ridiculous idea.<p>Google doesn't have any obvious motivation for wanting to suppress dissent. Google does have a motivation for making a popular social network that can supplement their other products, and hopefully be a profitable business sometime in the future. You suggest that the motivation might be a secret US government order, and it is pretty sad when that is the most plausible theory.<p>It's one thing for the government to force the handover of some data. It's totally another for them to be secretly controlling the minutiae of R&D at a company all the way from the secret inception of the project...<p>Additionally a ""real name"" policy will in practice be a ""real-looking name"" policy, and thus not all that useful for censorship. If you use the pseudonym Mike Johnson or Steve Smith, how likely do you think it's that Google would be checking your identity? Is there any evidence at all that people with some political views are being singled out for id checks.<p>> You claim there are plenty of practical reasons, but you didn't list any. I can think of some, but none that are appropriate for a social network.<p>Well, the biggie for a social network would be that there's empirical evidence that social networks using real names seem to be more successful, and more useful. Nobody ever got fired for copying Facebook.<p>Using real names means that people who know you by your real name can easily find you. The network is less likely to be run over by novelty  / joke / abusive accounts. People will in general behave better than when being pseudo- or anonymous. All of this will translate to better user experience and engagement for a large group of people.<p>So if you want to create a product with mainstream appeal it seems totally reasonable from a business perspective to go somewhere near closer to the real identity end of the spectrum. No sinister conspiracy needed.<p>Maybe some of these reasons are fallacious, either for everyone or small niches of people. It doesn't matter; all that's needed is for the people in charge to believe that they're valid for 95% of the people, and it'd still lead to the same decision being made.<p>> Thus the comment you're replying to is not out of line-- it is a primary reason to use a pseudonym. And it is a real threat in countries like North Korea, Iran, etc.<p>It might be a reason to use the pseudonym, but that in no way implies that wanting to prevent that is the main reason to forbid pseudonyms.",1313175425

Python has multi-threading - due to GIL, only one of them execute at a time, which isn't very different from running multiple threads on a single processor machine. It facilitates concurrency, not parallelism.<p>>  claiming that multi-process is the way to do parallel computation across the board is not a sane argument at all.<p>If you have n processing units, anything greater than n isn't parallel.

Isn't this going to happen if you have multiple threads running even if the GIL is blocking them from running?<p>I don't think it would. If there is a GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) only one thread of the process can be scheduled to run at any time. As the poster (Sturla) says, Python threads are native OS threads so they should be scheduled by the OS kernel (right?). A good scheduler would use affinity scheduling and schedule all threads of the Python program on the same processor/core every time to get benefits from cached data and code. I believe modern kernels (Linux, MacOS, Solaris, probably Windows as well) use this kind of affinity scheduling, so if we're lucky the Python process gets scheduled on the same processor every time and there will be no need any cache synchronization.<p>> I'm not a hardware expert, but I'm not sure how constant locking would prevent cache synchronization just because they weren't truly running in parallel.<p>I'm not sure if you misunderstood the mail. The constant locking would only be used if they <i>were</i> running in parallel.<p>Anyway, if you have a GIL you don't need that kind of locking described in the mail. You only need to do explicit locking on shared data structures when you read or update the contents of those data structures. If you have reference counting, threads that run in parallel and no GIL you would have to lock even if you are just assigning a reference to such a data structure to a new variable. If you have a GIL you are certain that only one thread at a time are updating the reference count. That is indeed what the GIL is, one coarse lock for all data (and the interpreter) instead of fine grained locks for every data structure.<p>(I don't know Python very well, I just answer from general knowledge of computer architecture and language implementation. But I've read about the Python GIL several times, since it's the most discussed GIL of any language.)",1313174370

If I'm shooting a panorama, I might take 12 or 13 shots in ~10 seconds.<p>I usually shoot more like 10,000-15,000 in a week, but I've gone closer to 20,000 in a couple cases. It's only 1500 photos a day for a 10,000 shot week. Which averages just a bit over 1 a minute for an 8 hour day (but who says I only spend 8 hours out and about?) but in truth, the shot times are more clumpy. For example, I shot about 30 photos in 2 minutes of Vasari's fresco inside the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore (the Duomo). I'll probably combine all those into one or two larger photos stitched up.<p>Differently, walking up to the same Basilica along a street in Florence offered several very different compositions of the same street. In 5 minutes I was able to shoot 20 pretty decent shots, and probably 1 or 2 really good ones.<p>That's 50 shots of the same building in a total of 7 minutes.<p>Riding on local public transport often gives you views of lots of neat things, and only one or two seconds to shoot them.<p>I'm not even counting the family photos I also took in the meantime.<p>And yes, I'll actually probably start looking for a replacement camera body sometime next year. I shoot with a D60, so it's only about $400-450...trivial compared to the cost of 5 or 6 2- week trips overseas.<p>My wife used to think I was crazy, but now years later, going over these old photo archives, we can remember in fantastic detail many of the great places we've traveled together.",1313172687

The cost of buying a feature, team, or technology goes up over time.<p>You could make the argument that this creates wonderful incentives for the startup environment in general, thereby attracting much more talent to the space. But in large part, this talent is poached or drawn away from existing tech companies. Increasingly, you're even seeing talent bounce from one pre-exit startup (!) to another. In addition, there may come a point where the end-stage acquisition market dries up, because the price of acquisitions gets too high for positive payback/ROI on would-be-acquirers' balance sheets.

1484571,comment,1484308,1484428,0,0,Lewisham,,,"""Apple's bet is that users will reject the platform with more features in favor of the platform that works better.""<p>For as long as Mac OS X 10.2 (that's when I jumped on board, so I can't comment about the OS 9 days), this has been how Apple has operated.<p>Mac OS X is actually pretty feature devoid, out-of-the-box. First thing I have to do when I get a new machine is install Google Search Box, Growl, Skitch, MarcoPolo just so it feels like it works right. I don't count these as applications; I think of them as base OS features. By laundry list of features, Windows comes out on top.<p>What is different is that Mac OS X's UNIX underpinnings, coupled with a thoughtful Cocoa API means that developers can fill in the gaps for power users, whereas everyone else is happy with the experience they get. I'm not sure if Apple's strategists really understand this, or if it is just the engineers. You could be forgiven for thinking the UNIX core is just some accident of history due to NeXT rather than any conscious effort.<p>iOS doesn't support extension like this, and it's deliberate and calculated. The App Store is not there to protect normal users, it's there to protect Apple. If you gave users the option of App Store apps and also the ability to install unsigned apps (with appropriate scary warnings), all the people Apple claims to be concerned about would function exactly as they do now, downloading from the App Store and avoiding everything else. Why would they need to do otherwise? Instead, we have an App Store that seems to be all about sticking it to Google and maintaining some Disney-esque political landscape. It's nothing like the Apple we used to know.",1278194214

Everyone is required to pay sales tax for purchases made over the Internet, there's just no way for the states to enforce it.

What I'm saying is when people use the phone search they are trying to search the phone part of the device (SMS, email, etc...).  That doesn't preclude developeres from putting search in their own apps they just can't clutter up the phone search with results from their apps.<p>That in mind I see Apple's point here as being ""we think developers will abuse search if they are allowed in and we don't think users want that so we're keeping them out"".

I don't know about you, but I'm not a good enough marketer (or developer) to overcome yet another 10% vig on my productivity.</i><p>Is this a general principle that you're willing to defend? I mean, there are many marginal businesses that are not viable right now but that could be viable if they didn't have to pay taxes. Do you believe that all of these businesses should be forgiven from having to pay taxes?<p><i>Not to mention geolocation issues.</i><p>The article seemed to speak entirely about physical goods. And when you're talking about physical goods, it seems that geolocation issues aren't really a big deal: just tax based on the delivery state.<p><i>competition can be squashed by raising the barriers to entry through taxation and regulation.</i><p>That's one way to look at it. Alternatively, one might simply say that freeloading is bad and that internet retail allows some people to unfairly reduce their tax rates without a corresponding reduction in their use of state services. So, if young upper middle class folks buy lots of stuff on the internet and save $500 of sales tax every year, then the fact that they've come up with a clever way to screw over their fellow (older, not-so-upper-middle-class citizens) isn't really a sufficient justification for the state to preserve their little racket.",1278193841

That was the idea of my comment, there probably isn't such a thing as passive income without buying an object(not asset) that pays a royalty/dividend, I just thought you were using the word in a way in which it isn't intended.<p>3.) Totally, i think you need to build the support systems around the business. People will want to buy a money machine, not a hassle. Having as much of that handled before you go to sell it will make it at least at first glance a way better investment.  if they are looking at buying a business, aside from them being a competitor, they are basically saying, ""You know, I don't trust TNK, and i'm really tired of buying stocks, maybe i'll sink some money here"" then they look at your recipe for making money and decide if they want to buy the whole lot.<p>I just think if you are making 200k you can probably find someone that would be happy as hell to manage most of it and you dabble in it a few hours per week. So mathwise (rounding a week to 50) 4k a week..you can certainly find someone that wants to take some equity and try to build upon that, figure out some sort of metrics for gain aside from salary handled things(what you don't ever want to see, q/a etc) and go from there.",1278193767

The sweet spot cost/performance wise is the GTX295.<p>2) you can stick 4 top notch cards in a machine, with 2 GPUs each, giving you a net 8 fold increase over the results in the paper, or if you take their 2.5 times figure as a baseline for a 20 fold increase over a regular CPU (if you believe the rest of the claims the paper makes).<p>3) GPU speedups can not be 'averaged', you either have something that maps well to the GPU or you don't, if you do extreme speedups are possible, if you don't you'll end up spending a large amount of time trying to adapt your problem to the architecture of a GPU, if your time is cheap or of the problem is large enough that your time spent is a small fraction of the total cost this may be worthwhile.<p>4) So, if you have a problem you need to solve only once and the trade-off is your time vs cpu time then most of the times cpu time will win out, but if the problem is recurring in nature and matches the model well then GPUs are pretty much unbeatable for FLOPS/$ and FLOPS/W (at the moment, and no doubt this will change at some point in the future).",1278193347

It also ends up being somewhat regressive, because well-off people buying expensive things are much more likely to order them off the internet than poor people buying cheaper things are--- so poor people pay their local sales tax, and well-off people avoid it.<p>It's also logistically a bit easier to do it with physical goods, because you're necessarily shipping to an actual address.",1278191480

I know that nutritional science generally is a bit patchwork (hard to do rigorous long-time studies), but isn't the cave man diet still a bit of a fringe topic? Last time I checked this, it seems that the general opinion was that it's eating too much that's most of the problem, not eating the wrong stuff (gross simplification, of course).<p>That's my main problem with nutritional advice, once it goes beyond ""don't eat too much"": Not enough scientists.

But you're clearly a software person (as are most people here), just like me, and we see the world as simple and properly abstracted.  The reality here is that this is not a simple problem, and will never become one: there are just too many variables.<p>Here's an example that might be simpler to relate to: audio.  The power of sound is measured in watts (as any stereo will advertise).  If someone were to make a noise measurement tool, they might display the level in watts.  This would be wrong because we don't perceive sound linearly, and ""a little more"" would actually display as much more particularly at higher decibels.<p>But even reporting volume in decibels does not reflect how ""loud"" something is.  We perceive loudness in a complex manner, and even at low volume a person yelling can sound loud.  This is why pop music and commercials are louder at the same volume[1].<p>Now imagine that we will create a display of 5 bars that will show how loud something is.  We would start with the logarithm of power (dB) because thats pretty easy.  But now people put their hand over the device and it still sounds loud, even though our display shows it to be half as loud.  Is this a broken system?  Not really - just a complicated one.<p>So please, I understand that you do not understand.  But try to understand that this is complicated, and Apple actually has some idea what they are doing.<p>[1 | <a href=""http://www.propellerheads.se/substance/discovering-reason/index.cfm?article=part3&fuseaction=get_article"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.propellerheads.se/substance/discovering-reason/in...</a>]",1278191281

It's got very little to do with ""features"" and everything to do with the experience. So yeah, Android might have features that make the average geek go weak at the knees but Google, at least so far, hasn't shown the ability to get past the engineering and into the joy of the interface. I'm hoping that Gingerbread will get there, but it takes a supreme focus to do good UI. Apple's got it, Google needs to get it.",1278191090

Dividends aren't only a good way for a company to return value to investors (which a public company is legally obligated to do), it's frequently one of the most tax-friendly ways.<p>Secondly, you need to consider that Apple's two biggest competitors, Microsoft and Google hold large cash reserves also. It would potentially be catastrophic to has significantly less cash on hand than either. Essentially, all three companies are forcing each other to hold cash on hand.<p>Finally, there's a limit to how fast a company can grow, and there's a limit to what cash on hand says about a company when that company is doing quite well. Looking at a number on a balance sheet and saying ""that's not going to work"", when the company is turning over profits, inventing new markets, and has comparatively killer margins is wrong.",1318913781

3123932,comment,3123507,3123608,6,0,gojomo,,,"I think Groupon's model preys on small businesses unskilled in accrual accounting and pricing strategy. Also, both my readings and personal interactions have given me the impression that in their hyper-growth they have become a deeply dishonest organization.<p>All that said, however, there are still some interesting non-predatory wrinkles in their model.<p>The single deal at a time served to create consumer focus. The trigger threshold gave merchants confidence a deal would have a certain minimum impact. The time limit and trigger threshold served as an especially powerful call-to-action: now or never.<p>Though Groupon quickly tuned things (and grew) such that every deal was essentially guaranteed to 'tip', the group-threshold-mechanics were important for accelerating early adoption, overcoming vendor- and consumer- resistance to coordinated action. This mechanism, rooted in economics and game theory and related to the 'assurance contact' concept, still has utility for other endeavors, among them Kickstarter, even if that mechanic standing alone does not provide any sort of defensible advantage.<p>By all means, throw out the baby. But don't forget there's still something interesting in that bathwater.",1318913516
3123931,comment,3122233,3123369,6,0,JangoSteve,,,"You misinterpreted my comment. I wasn't looking to comment scores as a measure of ""correctness"". Hell, I can find out correctness on my own by actually researching the topic. I used comment-scores as a measure of consensus. That is, after all, exactly what it is.<p>Simple example:<p>> Ask HN: What's the best way to perf-test my server?<p>> comment X: <i>I use httperf, it has great features and is very robust.</i><p>> comment Y: <i>Check out Apache Benchmark (ab).</i><p>There is a huge difference between whether comment X is marginally higher than comment Y (i.e. it has slightly more upvotes), compared to if it's a factor of 2-5 or more. In the former scenario, I know to spend an equal amount of time evaluating both, while for the latter scenario, I know one project has much greater user-adoption among the HN community than the other (or at least more passionate adoption).<p>Likewise, if a comment thread has a question that has 50 upvotes, then many more people seem to be interested in that particular facet than another question with 3 upvotes.<p>My point is that comment points provide an additional form of context. I actually want to know ""what the cool kids think"", because that in itself is useful info. In most cases, I take it with a grain of salt, but that's really up to me. If other people misinterpreting comment points, or abusing them, means I can't have them... well, that's a shame. HN will continue to be the fraction of its former self for me.",1318913458

Likewise, in Scotland, the rivalry between Rangers and Celtic maps onto the conflict between Protestant, British unionism and Catholic separatism. This extends as far as Ireland.

Living in such groups necessitated political maneuvering and caused an ""arms race"" of increasingly sophisticated tactics used by the group members to gain status. This theory also claims that living in such groups had a far bigger impact on the development of intelligence than toolmaking did and resulted in each of us possessing a theory of mind and being capable of introspection.<p>What I thought was interesting is that if political decision-making is performed by an area in the brain that is completely separate from, for example, problem-solving, then this fact doesn't play very well with the above theory.",1318911877

5062957,comment,5060936,5062162,7,0,crikli,,,"I'm doing an extraordinarily poor job of communicating today.<p>I've had the Black Dog, as Churchill called depression, at my heels since I was a kid.  Hereditary type thing, history of suicide in the family.  11 years ago I saw myself headed towards the edge of a cliff and made a phone call that saved and ultimately changed my life.<p>Having dealt with the type of depression that leads one to that edge, I also know that one of the side effects is extreme self-absorption.  You feel so shitty and hopeless that all you can think about is how shitty and hopeless things are, which creates a downward spiral that can ultimately lead to someone deciding to take their own life.  Everything becomes about you and your pain, and there is not a way to just ""suck it up"" and get out of the pit, because depression doesn't work like that.  It takes help from without.  I.e., counseling, medication, etc, but because the person is so down just reaching out for those things can be like trying to reverse gravity.<p>But I've also been on the other side of things, where a friend decided to kill himself, and I've seen how his decision emotionally eviscerated the people that loved him.  Suicide truly is an incredibly self-centered act; the self-centeredness isn't a character flaw, it's an outgrowth of the disease.  But that doesn't make it different from what it is, and it doesn't make the effects of that decision any less devastating to a person's loved ones.<p>I fully realize that the above two paragraphs are somewhat ambivalent and that's because I'm pretty ambivalent towards those who commit suicide.  Part of me feels sorrow that they got to that point, the other part feels like they're selfish a-holes.  And somehow each part makes up more than half.",1358283562

That's not what he's doing.<p>He's presenting another view of the world where, even in a free and democratic society, the media has institutional, structural weaknesses that cause it to serve power. To amplify certain messages, and attenuate others.<p>It's an attempt to explain how a free society could have committed such atrocities as the Vietnam War, and later, gotten suckered into the Iraq War.<p>I have seen the debate about this shift in my lifetime. In the early 90s, when the Manufacturing Consent movie came out, I was in a journalism program and even interviewed the makers of that film. Many of the other students in my classes found the film bewildering. They quite honestly believed the media were just serving the people in the great engine of democracy.<p>Nowadays everyone is aware of how badly the media is failing the public. There are satirists who make this point on a literally Daily basis.<p>Of course, the general public's cynicism is often unsophisticated, and manifests itself as accusations of intentional bias. But there is more and more awareness of how the structure of the media itself affects what gets covered - perhaps because the Internet offers a counterexample.",1358283541

It's a beautiful UI, but changing banks is an awful pain in the butt and I'm pretty happy, in general, with Bank of America.<p>My wife and I have our personal and joint accounts there. I hardly ever use my debit card (nobody should! Debit cards are, in general, awful. Credit cards give you actual protection and far more perks). What I care about in my bank is that I can easily connect everything with my wife, that I can easily do bill pay, and that I have full-service ATMs and iPhone apps that include deposit features.<p>But if I was 20 again and had far simpler banking needs, I think I'd use Simple.<p>Oh, another thing is, when it comes time for a mortgage or other installment loan, it's sometimes beneficial to have my money at the same institution. If we decided to dump BofA I can see us moving to a credit union (Alliant is great, for example), but as Simple isn't a full-service bank I'd have to pass on it.",1358282917

Anthony is a very well known PHP developer - by which I mean he develops PHP, not just <i>in</i> PHP, and has voting rights regarding the direction the language takes. (Please don't hold that against him, Jeff.)<p>While I'm sure he was posting a lot of submissions for his own site, it was really great stuff. The first I really heard of him was due to a series of articles he and another developer wrote as a guide to understanding the internals of PHP with directions on what various C code was and how it hung together. It wasn't spam, at least not by any definition I care to recognize.<p>This didn't matter. Quality didn't matter. Apparently, one of the moderators to /r/php even went to bat for him with the admins, asking that the ban be lifted. The admins didn't care.<p>Meanwhile, many people submit a lot of content they also made themselves - memes. If you want to make a bunch of advice animal image macros and upload them to imgur, that's fine. If you write a five part dive into the guts of PHP's internals, you're banned.<p>It's funny too, because maybe I'm remembering incorrectly since it's been so long, but I seem to recall early reddit specifically saying that it was cool to submit your own stuff, and even encouraging it.

5062638,comment,5061916,5062416,14,0,Jun8,,,"Your glasses analogy is interesting but I think is misleading, in that it assumes there's a correct way to view things. This approach is one of the major problems I have with Chomsky and other writers like him, i.e. ""you have been duped by the (mostly US) media, the military-industrial complex, by the secret powers that may be; <i>here</i> is the real truth about matters"". Rather than being presented as <i>the</i> truth, these opinions be seen to be another viewpoint that enhances your understanding of the situation.<p>Let me give an analogy that may not be totally appropriate but I find is kind of illuminating: Many people, based on their everyday experience, believe in the existence of the centrifugal force (otherwise how to explain what they are experiencing daily). Then, their physics professor explains to them that <i>in reality</i> there is no such thing. Only if they study physics farther than the freshman year do they learn that <i>that</i> is not true either. Other similar examples of hypercorrection can be given (see this interesting answer: <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/13568/852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/13568/852</a>). The intent of the professor is benign, i.e. not to confuse the students, but it perpetuates a half-truth.<p>Coming from a non-US country, I have to say that those of you who heavily criticize US media for manipulating opinion should look deeper into the media of other countries (not that I'm saying that the US media is non-manipulative, it's that the breadth of publicly sharable opinion is astonishing).",1358280404

People working for small companies can usually make a good case that they are working on something different.<p>Fourth, there is a real difference in culture.  In California it is common for people to do things like""start companies on the side"", and therefore the natural response upon finding that someone has done so is to not try to contest it unless they have specific cause to.

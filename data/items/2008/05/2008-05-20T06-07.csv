They need to have a domain where a given candidate solution can be quantitatively measured, or alternatively where you can induce a relative ordering. This could possibly require human input (""rank these three pictures from best to worst""), but you need to at least have the ability to say that one solution is more fit than another.<p>2. A candidate solution's fitness needs to be at least somewhat continuous. Ideally there needs to be a gradient of success and opportunities for incremental quality improvement with corresponding incremental fitness improvements. Evolutionary methods cannot solve needle-in-a-haystack problems.<p>3. They're of greatest utility where human ingenuity is of the littlest value: i.e., where the problem domain is little understood. For example, finance, and, apparently, things like radar design: black arts where no one really knows what the fuck. Ths should help mullify claims about human verification and the human element of design: these things work best where a lifetime of experience doesn't buy you much and you kind of have no other choice.<p>4. As with any search heuristic, you face an eternal battle between exploration of the search space and exploitation of it: you can exhaustively explore one part of the space, but that will generally come at the cost of ignoring alternative solutions. This manifests itself as a struggle against premature convergence. Depending on how much domain knowledge (an often-overlooked component) you can incorporate in, this may not be a problem (you can modify your fitness criteria to automatically avoid settling upon certain undesirable parts of the search space).<p>5. Finally, always keep in mind that this is not ""AI"". This is not trying to model human cognition. The stuff about being inspired by natural selection is true at first, but when you get more sophisticated you'll deviate more and more from this. Hybrid solutions are common; for instance, you may have a normal stochastic evolution scheme at first, but then at the end greatly slow down the rate of learning and at the end when you've settled upon a satisfactory solution you may wish to incorporate traditional local search methods, which really have no biological inspiration, it's just that they just freakin' work, so you  use it because you care more about <i>solving your problem</i> than constantly aping nature.<p>Biological or natural inspiration can be useful, but only in the context of practical problem solving, which is what evolutionary methods have always been about. The first widely read book on genetic algorithms was written by an oilfield roughneck with a PhD in civil engineering and the field is still kind of a pariah in academia because of its relative lack of formal foundations. All this is disregarded in the name of practicality, which is an attitude, flawed or not, much closer to what prevails in the real world.",1211266747

How about Paxti's, gyros gyros, Homma's Brown Rice Sushi, the Counter, Vino Locale?  A bit of a walk north will take you to Cafe Borrone and Jan's Deli, the latter of which happens to have one of the greatest turkey sandwiches ever.

You can type in ""Dachshund Lovers"" and find ten pages of search results about them. If a group is any smaller than that, there just might not be any content to find, or at least not enough for a social news site.<p>I assume you've used Google Blog Search and Technorati, then followed links from the blogs you did find?

194785,comment,192058,192058,0,0,sunkencity,,,"Major reason to use TextMate is that it's got a good file tree overview, like eclipse. I find that working with rails and constantly looking around and inspecting the file tree is very pleasant in textmate. I like emacs, but not for jumping around between files, and the speedbar is horrible. On textmate if something happens in the file system it's instantly reflected when you switch back into textmate. I wish the speedbar would recieve a good rewrite in emacs.<p>Otoh, development on textmate seems to be pretty slow or nonexistent, it would be nice if split view would have been implemented by now.",1211265140
194784,comment,194334,194505,0,0,tx,,,"Last time I've been to Silicon Valley it was 2003 and I hated it: the place had no soul compared to our beloved Austin. Then I got hired by a kick-ass Austin startup  staffed by some ex-SV (and ex-Seattle) residents who acted like moving to Austin was the best move they ever did.<p>Fast forward to 08 and I have started to think about moving to SV again due to supposedly better ""startup climate"" and my recent trip to the startup school cured me again: no way in hell I'll ever live there, despite their 200+ VCs and ""energy"" that PS was writing about: that's not enough to compensate for the overall dullness. Silicon Valley simply isn't inspiring: one of the reasons I want to work for myself is because I despise the corporate environment (walls of cubicles). Guess what - the entire SV feels like a wall of cubicles, even when you're not at work.",1211265109

It's also a hassle to return stuff, even if it's free).<p>2) I can imagine with your atrocious rate ratio of returns, you'd be far more inclined to pay a few more dollars to make that experience better via Zappos then stinge out and deal with paying for the return shipping and poor customer service issues elsewhere. (i.e. if they raise their prices, who cares? Everyone knows Zappos was built on their excellent customer service and selection, not their prices)<p>(Note: I personally haven't used Zappos myself, but I've heard Tony talk about his customer service oriented culture in person and they sure seem to be doing just fine with it).",1211264638

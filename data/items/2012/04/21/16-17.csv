In order to get the raw data that requires complex and high speed algorithms to parse in to useable data, you'll still need a website, built by a rails/backbone code monkey and a Photoshop designer and with the help of a decent DBA, at the very least.

[2]<p>So yes, many times yes: This article is completely and totally wrong. And as adrianhoward says, it's the same sentiment that my parents chided me with back in the 90s, and that I hear all the time from people who imagine that the silver bullet is just around the corner that will make it so that we need fewer rather than more programmers. (FWIW: My degree is in ""Cognitive Science"", the ""other CS"", and I haven't had problems getting jobs when I've wanted one.)<p>And as an aside, if you look at the graph with yellow and brown bars about 2/3 of the way down [2], getting a job where math is the primary required skill looks like a slog (looks like about 2x as many math grads as math jobs), while in order to hire people AT ALL, companies are going to have to ignore whether they have a computer science degree, because there are nearly 3.5x as many jobs in CS-related fields as there are graduates in CS.<p>Based on these numbers it looks almost inevitable that we'll see echos of the ""You've put together a web page? By yourself! You're hired!"" dot com boom, just because it will be so hard to hire anyone at all.<p>So, while the story was cute, its premise is FUD that has a chance of scaring people away from CS at precisely the time that we need more people in CS.

Only versions released under GPL are out in the wild as ""lost sales"", and are more likely to garner good will than cause a loss of profits. As for BSD, well you wouldn't want your competition locking up your code and selling it back to you, now would you?

3872219,comment,3870478,3871709,2,0,kijin,,,"That looks like a too rigid view of what REST requires.<p>It's possible to view different versions of an API as different representations of the same data. For example, an HTTP server is permitted to return different responses, or even return an error, depending on the contents of the client's ""Accept:"" header. If versioning was done with a header instead of the URL, it would achieve essentially the same results. The client would be saying ""I want /user/123/posts/recent, and I want it in the APIv3 format.""<p>If an API method changes so much that it is no longer recognizable as a different representation of the same data, the URL should probably change to reflect the new content. The old URL would then return data only when the old version is requested, and ""406 Not Acceptable"" when the new version is requested. So I don't see any reason why API versioning can't be RESTful. It's just slightly more difficult to do it RESTfully, compared to adding the version in the URL.<p>In any case, I'd rather take practicality over RESTful purity.",1335027170

3872172,comment,3871846,3872088,10,0,brandall10,,,"I absolutely agree.<p>I've actually had this thought lingering in the back of my head as I'm in the midst of making the transition from primarily MS desktop/embedded C++/C# guy to open source stack web app guy.<p>A few years back, in a review my supervisor put in a recommendation to go into management. I asked if I would be able to code anymore. Nope. I felt that was some subtle death trap - to lose my skills through non-use, and turned it down, 20% pay bump be damned.<p>So now this transition, and began to think of it in the same light. But it doesn't work. It's been 13 years since I graduated, and I'm probably better at most CS'esque interview questions than anytime since then. Why? Because of what I did that led me to making this transition, essentially becoming unhappy in my job and looking for anwers, which started with a book called ""The Passionate Programmer"", which led to maybe 20-30 other books, completing some classics (such as K&R C), some incomplete (SICP, only halfway thru chapter 2), but in general exploring my craft in a way that my job did not require me to. I'm a much better programmer because of it, language be damned.<p>So here's the question I have:<p>Who is more likely to be aware of things such as CLRS, SICP, Hacker News, Stack Overflow? Who is more likely to understand (or even be aware of) languages like Clojure, Haskell, Prolog, Python, Ruby, etc? Who is more likely to give you more lucid answers to problems with big data, having even touched a NoSQL database and pontificate on the advantages/drawbacks of that vs. relational? Your typical enterprise dev, or your typical open source web dev? After talking about all this stuff to a team of 30+ engineers over the past few years, I'd have to put my $$ on and double down firmly on the latter.<p>Of course, this is only an example of one engineer's experience. But I think there's a more meta issue at play here... it's more of the 501s vs. the non-501s, the latter being ones who well, just are more aware of what's actually going on in their respective industry. If the industry as a whole makes a tectonic shift toward algorithmically more difficult problems (ie. machine learning), I trust the open-source web devs will be on it and synthesize it faster than your typical enterprise guy will even be aware there is a need.",1335025972

They forgot that they had jQuery loaded in already. You can see this by looking at the lines when they define w and h.

They are using some tools to check for or create automatic clean javascript. Not a semi-colon or tab out of line.

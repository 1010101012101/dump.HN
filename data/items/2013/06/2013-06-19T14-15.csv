In that case there&#x27;s nothing to prevent the IRS from doing something because there&#x27;s no reason for them to do anything at all.<p>If the IRS is unable to execute enforcement of the law concerning taxation then that&#x27;s not a loophole, it&#x27;s likely a criminal act. That would imply that something could possibly change in the future that would no longer prevent the IRS from collecting the tax, with penalties.<p>I see these two as completely separate things.<p>People need to get out of this mindset that the big companies are using loopholes in the tax code to cheat the government out of tax revenue. If the loophole exists due to the law then there is no cheating, just bad law. Public companies are practically obligated to reduce their tax liabilities as much as possible and if the government gives them the abilities to do so, then why is that the company is considered the evil entity in the matter? They are simply doing exactly what the government and the law has told them they are obligated to do.",1371653927

[1] It incentivizes providers like Netflix to continue increasing their value proposition and ensures profits are flowing back to creators/library owners commensurate with their value.<p>If Netflix fails, at this point, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be too big a blow.  There are plenty of services in the same space and the feeding frenzy for Netflix library contracts would ensure the survivors are offering the same library to the same market.<p>And I&#x27;m not sure why you think Hollywood feels no pressure to get their content in front of viewers.  Their proper interest is to maximize the return on their libraries, and they can hardly do that if they enable the creation of an 800 lb gorilla in the streaming market that can dictate terms.<p>Should Netflix be the undisputed one-true-service for digital delivery, <i>that</i> would almost certainly become bad for viewers.  What incentive would <i>they</i> have to work with MS/Google on enabling federated/integrated search/navigation?  What incentive would <i>they</i> have to work with new device makers as they have?<p>Netflix fantastic value proposition is a product of how intensely competitive that space is, due its future up-side.  Things that preserve that competition are Good, even if they are bad for Netflix specifically, up until the point they are bad for the entire streaming market.<p>[1]  The current division between Hulu, Netflix, ABC, HBO Go, et al. is about as high a wall as you&#x27;d want. Different services, same box, same-ish interface/behavior. If you couldn&#x27;t get multiple services on the same hardware, it&#x27;d be too high.  And, of course, if you could get XB1/GoogleTV-style federated search/navigation across services, the status quo would be just fine.",1371653791

5905879,comment,5905391,5905391,3,0,gnosis,,,"I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Opera, who switched back to Firefox and then back to Opera a couple of times.<p>Opera has been consistently <i>much</i> faster and better designed than Firefox.  But it has one major, glaring fault: it&#x27;s closed-source.  I just don&#x27;t trust closed-source software anymore.  I also had concerns about privacy-invading directions Opera was taking (such as sending all of one&#x27;s keystrokes to a search engine as you typed them in an address bar search -- your typing rate could be used to aid the search engines in uniquely identifying you).  So I switched back to Firefox and have been using it steadily for a few years now.<p>With Pentadactyl, Firefox is much more usable in many ways than Opera was.  Though even Pentadactyl can&#x27;t make up for some of Firefox&#x27;s ingrained faults, such as it&#x27;s atrocious bookmark manager, or Firefox&#x27;s incredible slowness.<p>I refuse to use Chrome on principle, because it spies on its users by default.  This behavior can supposedly be disabled, but I have serious ethical objections to any browser that starts out in that state, and is associated with a spyware company like Google.  Chromium is better in that at least it doesn&#x27;t start out by spying on you, but it still lacks addons that are as capable as Firefox&#x27;s Pentadactyl and NoScript.<p>Most recently I&#x27;ve started migrating as much as possible away from all of these bloated browsers.  On 99% of the websites I visit, I now use w3m embedded in emacs.  This integration gives me far more power than even Pentadactyl in Firefox, and it&#x27;s far faster than any of the popular browsers.<p>w3m&#x27;s main weakness is that it can&#x27;t handle Javascript, but that&#x27;s a strength too -- as I don&#x27;t have to worry about Javascript exploits.. and 99% of the websites I care about don&#x27;t require Javascript to function.<p>I am happy to get what I care about most: the content -- usually in plain-text format.  And for the few sites I care about which annoyingly insist on using Javascript for full functionality, I can always use the other browsers as a backup.  This approach might be a bit extreme for most people, but it works well for me.",1371653751

The only new process should be the  rendering canvas/window. An iframe, or any nested resources can re-use cookies associated with a window/process, including caching. In order to persist tokens/cookies/cache between processes you hand them their own copy when you spin them up and write them out to a common, re-usable place when you close, but for the most part I consider browser statefulness to be more like a flaw than a feature (I constantly clear my cookies, form data, and history). how about a &quot;save session&quot; button, rather than the default being to cache objects and cookies in some common blocking profile that only allows one session and that, when it crashes, it all comes down... If you really want to share, you wrap those services up in a library - which is closer to the present model - but you have to know that in doing so you are making it harder to isolate things when they fail...

For every new vehicle concept, I expect the manufacturer to find at least one safety-related design flaw after production begins.<p>If you are that manufacturer, you can save a little money by quietly telling your service centers how to fix it without informing the public. Auto manufacturers do this on a regular basis, even with serious powertrain safety issues like the ones found in Ford&#x27;s 2009+ Ecoboost engine and Audi&#x27;s 2002-6 CVT. Like Ford and Audi, you will probably get away with it. Your customers won&#x27;t notice the pattern until their cars are well out of warranty, and then they&#x27;ll blame it on age. If anyone dies as a result (and their family connects it to you) you&#x27;ll just settle confidentially out of court.<p>As far as I can tell, that is not what Musk chose to do.

Optional brackets and braces are something most languages have (bwim you can usually bracket or unbracket an expression without changing it), so it doesn&#x27;t bother me that scala has them in slightly more places.<p>Using _ for partial application of an object method is simpler than you make it sound; you always need it. That page misunderstands. I dislike the complexity but it allows UAP to work which is awesome; are there languages with a similar UAP and functions-as-values without requiring disambiguation?<p>Agreed that relative imports and renaming imports are evil bad and wrong.<p>Construction requires new; I think this is largely there because it&#x27;s a major difference at the JVM level and some people care about knowing when it&#x27;s happening. Personally I agree we&#x27;d be better off without it.<p>Macros are new and experimental.

Going off phinergy&#x27;s number (8 kWh/kg), and assuming Tesla-parity range of 260 miles for an 85 kWh fill-up, you need 10.5 kg Al per fill-up, which costs $1.80/kg on the London Metal Exchange as of today, costing about $20/fill-up, or -<i>eep</i>- eight cents a mile, before considering tax, transit, manufacturing etc. For comparison my 2009 Toyota Prius (yes, I -am- that lame) costs nine cents a mile for fuel (350 miles, nine gallons, $3.50/gal). So aluminum-air largely negates the cost advantage of an electric battery, unless phinergy can come up with a superior way of making aluminum, which is already one of the most optimized processes in modern industry: the cryolite process has absorbed millions of hours of human attention.<p>If the power-density problems can be solved, zinc-air or similar may still be a good idea.

I highly doubt Leaseweb wiped the Megaupload servers &quot;just because&quot;.<p>This looks like an attempt by Kim to create outrage and bad PR for Leaseweb.",1371650576

My personal story on this is going across the border to see an NFL game in Detroit last year, turning off data because of the usurious rates Canadian carriers charge for roaming. When leaving I couldn&#x27;t navigate at all -- despite the relevant map being available -- so I had to turn data on for a couple of seconds just for Google to get the route. $20 for 3MB of data. Someone relying upon it when they&#x27;re out of cellular range would be in a much worse situation.",1371650574

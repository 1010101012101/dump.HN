Yes, there is undoubtedly some spin on it, but chucking out the entirety of Gladwell also dismisses, as just one example, implicit cognition research done at Harvard.<p>As techies and scientists we can gloat all day that we know correlation doesn't equate to causation, but exploring the stories behind correlations can help uncover the causal chain.<p>Goodness knows a great deal of qualitative academic research  (in top journals, no less) suffer some of the same criticisms Gladwell is enduring. Social sciences accept different ontologies and epistimologies [e.g., 1], and postivism is only one such, albeit the most common. Properly done, interpretivism, too, is accepted.<p>I think my biggest frustration with the Gladwell-bashing is that even though Gladwell's connections between research and anecdote are sometimes tenuous, those engaging in the critique don't first demonstrate an understanding of the epistimological/ontological standards in social research.<p>1: <a href=""http://misq.org/misq/downloads/download/editorial/25/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://misq.org/misq/downloads/download/editorial/25/</a>",1344193113

4342255,comment,4341812,4341903,4,0,dkarl,,,"As do many other people, but the difference between Malcolm Gladwell and the many, many successful authors who have written much more (and much better) is that Gladwell lets his readers <i>buy</i> the vicarious enjoyment of success.  It's just like watching an action-hero movie and feeling the thrill of being that brave, that strong, that resourceful, that much tougher than the bad guys.  Except that Gladwell has managed to combine the best parts of reading a book about Vietnam and watching Rambo:  First Blood Part II.  You get the virtuous smart-person feeling of the former and the escapist fantasy of the latter.<p>If Gladwell has any value, it's that he inspires us to imagine ourselves rising above our current limitations.  He does for us as adults lusting after career success what books like the Hardy Boys adventures did for us as kids. And maybe  we might elevate ourselves by acting out these fantasies in reality.<p>However, in his article in the latest New Yorker (about the distance runner Alberto Salazar) he steps back from inspiration and embraces the vicarious, voyeuristic nature of his work.  After taking us through the vicarious thrill of being so committed to winning that we run through our self-protective mental limits all the way up to the true limits of our bodies, eliminating all <i>slack</i>, he absolves us of responsibility:  Salazar's competitive career ended ten years too early; Gladwell himself abandoned competitive running because he couldn't take the pain; we need feel no self-consciousness about failing to follow Salazar's insane example.<p>The perfect time to read it would be while taking a nice break at work.",1344193055

There is a place for people who expose ideas to broader audiences, and in fact it is important for catching the interest of people who might one day go deeper and challenge some of the ideas.<p>I would liken him to my exposure to Martin Gardner and AK Dewdney in the back pages of Scientific American as a kid.  They weren't setting out to use their platform to do basic research in math and computer science, or to write definitive texts, but instead were popularizing interesting and though-provoking ideas in these area in a manner that was challenging yet accessible to a broader audience.<p>I know that I definitely would have been far less likely to pursue a career in science and technology had it not been for those who popularized the biz, like those two, Hofstadter, Tracy Kidder, et al.<p>As for people blinding taking what they consume as gospel, that seems to be a fairly universal human characteristic, whether the source is a cable news outlet, a religion, etc.  It is a high bar to set to require all written communication to be immune to misinterpretation or over generalization, and the burden rests more on the audience.",1344192692

I also, frequently tell my friends my password so they can do the same.  How many of you have typed your Apple ID password on your Apple TV with others watching?  I wouldn't really ask my friends to exit the room to type in a super secure and long password with many characters groups (one that should be required for remote wipe functionality).<p>How many users keep their password secure knowing the main place they enter it is on their iOS device?   For the many every day Apple users I know, they set their passwords to something easy so they don't have to hit their keyboard too many times when entering them.<p>If Apple, can separate the two authentication functions as they do with OS X and FileVault it would go a long way to preventing these types of rare but high impact events.  Another suggestion would be to separate the remote wipe into two phases, erasing the keys and cleaning up the data.  The initialization vectors (seed) do present a bit of a problem but I think the FileVault solution is more than adequate.  If the encryption keys and the key escrow system is cleared remotely, that would leave me comfortable that my data is still secure.  If we really trust our crypto algorithms, then erasing data and removing the encryption keys should really be no different.  Users that do not have iOS data protection and OS X FileVault turned on, cannot be considered any level of secure anyway.  And even with that data protection turned on, there are still many issues due to each app needing to implement security properly.  It would be really great to see Apple improve their App Store to really audit the security of each application more than they do today.<p>Most of the work lies with Apple but it is a hard problem that will take time.  I think Apple is going in the right direction by centralizing on iCloud rather than the PC as the central hub.  This will give them a lot more flexibility and agility to move quicker and deliver secure results to the masses.",1344192078

Visionaries have a strong and clear focus, but are grounded enough to recognize the merits of their competition and work within the ecosystem that customers / users already enjoy. Delusionaries pour scorn on their competition (or even claim to be so revolutionary that they HAVE no competition), and try to create a walled garden or vendor lock-in with zero install base. Even Apple made iTunes for Windows.<p>My first job out of college was at a startup. The founders were reasonable people who were heavily influenced and invested in by a delusionary, who saw their company as a vehicle to realize his ""vision"" of how technology should work. As a result we never really managed to grow beyond a couple of million in revenue, and that mostly from what amounted to R&D outsourcing from large firms with technically naive execs. Said delusionary repeatedly vetoed our attempts to make our product more relevant to a wider range of customers since it would compromise his vision. I bailed out of frustration, and a year later one of our customers just outright bought the firm to acquire the founders. I heard the delusionary was very satisfied with his exit. :p",1344190734

4050020,story,,,7,1,rasengan,"Tell HN: SQL Injection Vulnerability in latest Ruby on Rails",,"From the Rails Security List:<p>There is a SQL injection vulnerability in Active Record, version 3.0
and later. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
CVE-2012-2661.<p>Versions Affected:  3.0.0 and ALL later versions<p>Not affected:       2.3.14<p>Fixed Versions:     3.2.4, 3.1.5, 3.0.13<p>Impact<p>------<p>Due to the way Active Record handles nested query parameters, an
attacker can use a specially crafted request to inject some forms of
SQL into your application's SQL queries.<p>All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.<p>Impacted code directly passes request params to the `where` method of
an ActiveRecord class like this:<p><pre><code>   Post.where(:id => params[:id]).all
</code></pre>
An attacker can make a request that causes `params[:id]` to return a
specially crafted hash that will cause the WHERE clause of the SQL
statement to query an arbitrary table with some value.<p>Releases<p>--------<p>The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.<p>Workarounds<p>-----------<p>This issue can be mitigated by casting the parameter to an expected
value.  For example, change this:<p><pre><code>   Post.where(:id => params[:id]).all
</code></pre>
to this:<p><pre><code>   Post.where(:id => params[:id].to_s).all</code></pre>",1338494324

Great to see that you stuck with the project through what I'm sure were many ups and downs :)<p>I'm curious to know how you see the product benefiting people.  What do you see people actually using it for?<p>Right now it seems like a cute demonstration of a data mashup though not entirely factually correct. For example, if I search for ""Coldplay"" it says 85% affinity for Asian Indian and 82% Plastic Surgery and high Z-score for Hindi?  How do you ensure the accuracy of this data?<p>I think you need to display the results of this data differently to users. If its correct, people without statistics backgrounds will get confused because not everyone can interpret what a z-score means, nor will they understand how it is useful to them.",1338494242

4050013,comment,4049764,4049907,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"It's easy to assume Microsoft is basing decisions on what Apple is doing but I don't think Apple's design choices have any bearing on the new Windows8 interface. I can definitely see why it's easy to assume the connection because of Microsoft's ""embrace and extend"" motto and their one-step-behind lime of products like Zune, Windows Phone, etc. This time I really think they're thinking independently. It seems as though they've taken note of all the criticisms of Aero and tweaked it to be better and unique to Microsoft. If they've taken cues from anywhere I think it's Google and the minimalist web in general. The new UI chrome is very reminiscent of Google's design across all their products. It's very minimal, functional, and focuses more on readability and utility than what they've come up with n the past. Metro itself is a very cool idea that I really haven't seen from their competitors in any form.<p>I think you're right that they're deliberately going in a certain direction but I don't think Apple is playing as big a role in that decision as you imply. Despite Apple's growth and popularity Microsoft is still by far the biggest player in the OS market. Because of that I would doubt that they're as concerned with what Apple is doing on the desktop front and more interested in taking cues from them in the mobile device space.<p>I'm actually a huge Apple fanboy but I have to say the new Windows desktop is really beautiful! I haven't used a PC in years but I'd be happy to look at the New Windows non-Metro desktop all day. Microsoft is still making a lot of mistakes in cluttering their UI with buttons and ribbons and the like but hopefully the next step is to continue their momentum with the new Windows8 UI chrome and tackle the button/ribbon mess next.",1338494228

I'm the guy.<p>So, you're pretty much exactly who I wanted to reach with the second half of this post, because there is a great gap between a) your prior prediction of reality and b) the actual state of reality.  The actual state of reality is ""350 emails submitted in the last hour, approximately 60% confirmed.""<p>This is useful signal for you, because the next time you have to make a similar prediction about the nature of reality, where that prediction might be consequential, you will ideally make a <i>better</i> prediction.  All HNers who run a business have to make predictions like ""I have a limited budget in terms of time, focus, and resources.  If I spend effort on getting permission to email customers and then emailing them, will that do good things for the business?""<p>You might have had incomplete data prior to making your prediction of reality.  Here's some things which are probably material to that prediction which would have suggested biasing it in the favor of more confirmed opt-ins.<p>1)  I've spent a wee bit of time on HN for the last three years or so, and some folks around here find that I say helpful things.<p>2)  People will, generally, leap at the opportunity to get something which is presented as being something of value.  (Covered, in depth, in the blog post.)<p>3)  A lot of people -- including people who are very similar to you in many ways -- would happily ask to receive email if that were communicated to them as being something of value from someone they trusted.<p>There's other things which would have suggested guessing a lower number than one might have otherwise:<p>1)  The call to action in this blog post is not graphically prominent.  (See my other comment on this thread regarding a squeeze page, which means a page designed to encourage conversions to an email submission.  This page is very much not a squeeze page.)<p>2)  You have to read things, go to a separate page, and <i>then</i> take action.<p>3)  The list requires double opt-in (the first opt-in is giving your email address, the second is clicking a link in an introductory email to you saying ""Yes, I want to receive email from you""), which will always and everywhere decrease uptake versus single opt-in.",1338494025

That requires more effort than analog plumbing but can provide a far richer experience.<p>The other big issue is power (beyond the original 5V 500mA).  Apple have gone one (incompatible) way with that while the USB standard went a different way.

However, don't disrespect practical just because it isn't your bag of chips, particularly to an audience that is <i>full</i> of practical engineers.

4049749,comment,4047725,4049294,3,0,vbtemp,,,"> software engineering is still largely a collection of (fairly subjective and contextually-sensitive) best practices.<p>I agree<p>I'm glad I did computer science. Even though my title now is Software Engineer, I learned most software engineering best practices on the job. What's very difficult to learn on the job is computational complexity theory, advanced data structures and algorithms, or simply a solid background in discrete math. Basically, you probably won't find yourself contributing hard, cognitively challenging problems in computation with a ""software engineering"" degree.  In hindsight, if I had done some kind of ""software engineering"" program, I really would have sold myself short.",1338490980

4049745,comment,4049041,4049599,14,0,ja2ke,,,"Amnesia is fantastic example of using gameplay mechanics and rules to create mood.<p>Amnesia wants to use its interlocking game systems to make you feel afraid: You stay sane longer in the light. You have a limited amount of lamp oil with which to create light. Monsters make you insane (and kill you). Monsters can see you better in the light. Monsters make you go insane more quickly if you look directly at them (in the style of Lovecraft, gazing on things you should not see rend your mind).<p>The end result of this is a pretty wonderful set of rule balancing where, upon seeing a monster, the player immediately douses their lamp and hides in a dark corner staring at the wall, slowly going insane from a horror they cannot look at, knowing that looking at it will make them go truly mad, and turning on light for comfort will bring them a swift death.<p>It helps that on the art side, the visuals and audio are all built around creating and enhancing the mood, of course, but it's rare that there are a bunch of interlocking systems which can shape your behavior in a way that's that harmonious with an expected emotional output, a mood, tone, etc.<p>The game is rough around the edges and definitely created by a small team, but what it achieves is pretty rare.",1338490915

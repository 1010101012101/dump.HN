These behaviors include earlier initiation of sexual activity and less frequent use of condoms (Adler, 2006).</i><p><i>Unstable housing has been linked to risk for HIV infection, including IV drug use and unsafe sexual behaviors (Aidala, Cross, Stall, Harre, & Sumartojo, 2005).<p>Individuals who are homeless or in unstable housing arrangements are significantly more likely to be infected with HIV compared to individuals in more stable housing environments (Culhane, Gollub, Kuhn, & Shpaner, 2001).<p>Lack of socioeconomic resources is also associated with risk factors for neuropsychiatric dysfunction, such as exposure to environmental toxins and injuries. These factors can make persons with HIV more vulnerable to the central nervous system effects of the virus, including more rapid cognitive decline and onset of dementia (Satz, 1993).<p>HIV status often has a negative impact on socioeconomic status by constraining an individuals ability to work and earn income. Research indicates that up to 45 percent of people living with HIV are unemployed (Rabkin, McElhiney, Ferrando, Van Gorp, & Lin, 2004).<p>The effects of HIV on physical and mental functioning can make maintaining regular employment difficult. Patients with HIV infection may also find that their work responsibilities compete with their health care needs. Individuals infected with HIV are often discriminated against in the workplace, leading to their termination or forced resignation (Dray-Spira, Lert, Marimoutou, Bouhnik, & Obadia, 2003; Kass et al., 1994).<p>Children infected with HIV often exhibit cognitive deficits when compared with their uninfected peers (Martin et al., 2006). These deficits can adversely affect learning and earning ability later in life.<p>SES status often determines access to HIV treatment. Individuals of low SES have delayed treatment initiation relative to more affluent patients, reducing their chances of survival (Joy et al., 2008).<p>Patients of lower SES with HIV have increased morbidity and mortality rates. Research suggests a correlation between low SES and earlier death from HIV/AIDS (Cunningham et al., 2005).<p>Accordingly, individuals of higher SES levels experience slower progression of HIV infection (Schechter et al., 1994).<p>Decreased access to health insurance and preventive services is a major contributor to health disparities between high- and low-SES individuals. Low-income individuals are not likely to have health coverage or receive optimal treatment and care for HIV/AIDS, such as Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) (Wood et al., 2002)</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/factsheet-hiv-aids.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/factsheet-h...</a><p>Psueodoscience and outright bigotry is &quot;rarely PC&quot;, that&#x27;s for damned sure.",1373071191

You might have legacy reasons or have some portions of the code that are very performance sensitive and you can augment your non-C++ app with C++ code for those reasons - that would be understandable. But a full fledged C++ web app - tsk tsk. Let&#x27;s see -<p>1) Programmer availability and economics. Ton of RoR/PHP/Java and hopefully soon Go programmers, but good C++ programmers - good luck finding and retaining one.<p>2) Security - However competent YOU are - it just isn&#x27;t possible to write a complex web facing system that is also secure. I was part of a failed project to write an IdM system in C++. It was a huge pain when we hired a external org to do Penetration Testing. After they were done we were left with lot of damage. Part of this is language, part is a lack of lot of great framework/best practices/expertise.<p>3) You reinvent the wheel a lot. Want to talk to LDAP - write your own load balancing and failover aware C++ classes or maintain somebody&#x27;s unsupported OSS one. Equally headachy.

Tough job convincing the customers to use the same compiler/linker/libraries to build their plugins.<p>5) Performance monitoring, debugging and profiling tools.

It&#x27;s a syndrome. And the diseases which do the damage aren&#x27;t caused by the HIV virus. He just points that out like it&#x27;s something which no-one else is brave enough to mention, when he&#x27;s really just attacking strawmen.<p>The really crazy bits are when he talks about whether or not HIV can damage the immune system, by killing T-Cells. I counted 8 mentions of the word &quot;immune&quot;, and 7 mentions of the word &quot;T-cell&quot;; and he only mentions them halfway through the document.<p>Because of the complicated chain of causality (untreated HIV eventually wipes out the immune system, which causes a whole bunch of weird diseases to take hold), it&#x27;s easy to write thousands of words about why rare diseases (which are called AIDS, in HIV positive patients) are only correlated with HIV, not necessarily caused by it. But in the middle of the article, the crazy bits are there.<p>It&#x27;s like reading a long rambling article about why CO2 doesn&#x27;t necessarily cause global warming (which has a grain of truth to it - it&#x27;s a little more complicated than that with the role of positive and negative feedback effects), and halfway through the article the author suddenly mentions the greenhouse effect for the first time, then says it&#x27;s unfounded (which changes the article from slightly crackpot to stark raving mad) .",1373069830

To shut down FISC they would have to pass a new law, which they could not do tomorrow because they are not in session tomorrow.  And then the president would have to sign the law, or Congress would have to override his veto.  Yes, it is possible to change the law, but it&#x27;s not easy.  Likewise, the Constitution could be amended to rescind Roberts&#x27;s Article III privileges.  So the situation is exactly analogous.

What matters is that <i>until</i> the changes are <i>actually</i> made (by whatever process is needed to make them) the situation is what it is.

And I really doubt it was because of potential head of line blocking or lack of header compression.  I think users just were not clued in about pipelining.<p>The speed up between not using pipelining and using it is, IME, enormous.  1 connection for 100 files versus 100 connections for 100 files.  It is a huge efficiency gain.<p>Yet most users have never even heard of HTTP pipelining, or never tried it.  If they really wanted such a big speed up, why wouldn&#x27;t they use pipelining, or at least try it?  Why wouldn&#x27;t they demand that browsers implement it and turn it on by default?<p>Users are being encouraged to jump right into SPDY, a very recent and relatively untested internal project (e.g. see the CRIME incident) of one company, most users, if not all, having never previously experimented with even basic pipelining, which has been around since the 1999 HTTP/1.1 spec and has support via keep alives in almost all web servers.<p>Noticeable speed gains would be seen if www pages were not so burdened with links to resources on external hosts.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s really slowing things down, as browsers make dozens of connections just to load a single page with little content.  The speed gains from cutting out all that third party host cruft would make any speed gains from avoiding theoretical potential head of line blocking during pipelining seem miniscule and hardly worth all the effort.<p>If you want to see how much pipelining speeds up getting many files from the same host, you do not need SPDY to do that.  Web servers already have the support you need to do HTTP/1.1 pipelining.  (Though on rare occasions site admins have keep-alives disabled, like HN for example.

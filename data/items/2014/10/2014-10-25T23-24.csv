Instead have them do more investigative leg work before seizure so that it is whittled down further.  Or even freeze the money only for a month before which the IRS needs to make a case to a judge about why further time is warranted before returning the money.",1414281569

If the addresses are known ahead of time, processors are great about issuing loads as soon as possible.  They &#x27;retire&#x27; them in order, but if the situation is right they can &#x27;execute&#x27; them dozens of cycles ahead of time, even across loop iterations.<p>My guess would be that the slowdown from the interleaved searches is because spreading the loads across multiple cachelines actually works against you, since stalls become more rather than less frequent.  Ivy Bridge can have (about?) 10 outstanding L1 requests, which it can issue two per cycle.  With a 5 cycle (I think?) L1 latency, this is enough to cover up the latency.  Sustaining the two loads per cycle is hard, though, since only 4 ops per cycle can retired.  But there are not many other operations here, so the unrolled loop may come close.",1414279034

There&#x27;s a reason the NYT article focused on specific stories—the overall stats aren&#x27;t exactly that scary.<p>Of 639 seizures in 2012, 128 were legitimate. While 80% false positives doesn&#x27;t seem good at first glance, consider that it&#x27;s out of over 700,000 reports. Less than 0.1% of reports actually led to people&#x27;s money being wrongfully seized—that&#x27;s a low enough rate that it&#x27;s hardly worth worrying about. If anything, I&#x27;m more worried that they&#x27;re not catching more money launderers and tax evaders (only 128 seems awfully low in a country of 316 million).<p>I think most of us would be hard-pressed to come up with a system which had a similarly low error rate. Paypal, for example, hardly does any better. Probably the biggest problem here is just that we don&#x27;t provide effective enough mechanisms for remedying it.<p>But this article doesn&#x27;t even provide sufficient evidence of that. Take the Hirsch brothers who have been having trouble reclaiming their money. While that&#x27;s unfortunate, I can totally understand how an all-cash family business which paid vendors in cash might have trouble providing adequate records.

The Java SecurityManager is supposed to allow that by sandboxing code with limited permissions, but has had a number of bugs, some of which can be exploited to let malicious apps break out of the sandbox. That&#x27;s bad for cases where you are actually relying on running potentially malicious code, like applets in browsers. But not too relevant to the case where you&#x27;d be considering whether to choose Java, C, or C++ for a desktop or server app. In that case, treating the app itself as potentially malicious is not a common threat model: people don&#x27;t normally run C/C++ apps in a sandbox.

US needs a &quot;Constitutional Court&quot; that filters out unconstitutional bills after they are signed by the president, and before they become law. Some might still get through, but everything else will function just like it does today, so there will still be a chance for for that bad law to reach the Supreme Court and be struck down once and for all.<p>The benefit of a Constitutional Court however is that it should filter out <i>most</i> of the unconstitutional bills trying to pass the government. I feel that right now it&#x27;s <i>way</i> too easy for Congress/president to pass an unconstitutional bill, and then waiting anywhere from 5 to 20 years (or to never), to strike down that law, time in which a <i>whole generation</i> can be abused by the government (which I find unacceptable - bad laws should be struck down <i>much sooner</i>).<p>I also think special Courts are usually bad news as they tend to become <i>biased</i> towards their purpose. So for example a &quot;patent Court&quot; will become biased towards patents, a spying Court will become biased towards spying and so on.

Standardized tests even more so. Without any actual learning from the class itself, you can generally come close to ace&#x27;ing most high school tests by being moderately intelligent.<p>There was one class where I got busted for copying the homework and actually had to apply myself for the rest of the semester to avoid being failed, and this was only because the teacher felt I could rise to my potential if challenged to do so. Thankfully, that was actually one of the more interesting classes I had to attend.<p>I was warned constantly that college was going to tear me apart if I didn&#x27;t instill good study habits, but it was mostly more of the same.

After my freshman year, I went to class about 2 hours a week (out of ~18) and still kept above a 3.5 GPA.<p>At the two corporate jobs I&#x27;ve held so far, the same formula still seems to apply where you can avoid applying yourself 98% of the time as long as you can shine during the corporate equivalent of &quot;tests.&quot;<p>To date, it&#x27;s the hardest thing in the world for me to garner the self control to apply myself to a task if I&#x27;m not passionate about it (even forcing myself to pay bills is a challenge), and I think a large part of that is due to the fact that I&#x27;ve been able to coast through every &quot;challenge&quot; quite easily, and everything has seemed to work itself out so far.<p>This next month I&#x27;m actually striking out on my own, thankfully on something I&#x27;m passionate about (and have been working on for the past six months on the side), and I&#x27;m scared to death I won&#x27;t be able to actually follow through on the hard work required to be successful as an entrepreneur.",1414278507

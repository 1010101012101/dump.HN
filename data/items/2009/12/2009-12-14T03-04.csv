Long tail SEO is dominated by on-page factors, domain authority, and information architecture [+].

I am fairly upfront about what I'm doing: there are about 700 pages on my website which cost me about $3 each to write, and they are all designed to rank highly for a single search term or small basket of search terms.  Probably 95% of them deserve the #1 ranking on Google because they are the best content for that search term on the Internet.  (Better than 80% of them are the <i>only</i> content for that search term on the Internet.)<p>Similarly, the context the discussion I had with Thomas was also about creating user value out of a resource he already possessed but wasn't surfacing in a manner optimal to either searchers or his business interests.<p>[+] Edited to add information architecture, which I forgot to mention because I haven't worked on improving it in a while.

You could as easily argue that AT&T has had three years to fix their network, so it must be Apple's fault because if the blame lay at AT&T's door it would have been fixed by now. And _of course_ the number of complaints will rise as iPhone users rise if the problem is some interaction between the iPhone specifically and AT&T's network: there are more iPhone users in existence to complain!<p>All in all this is very, very poorly done.

It's fine for individual users, but it violates the contract of how network clients (browsers) are expected to act.<p>Once there's a sizable number of people using the technology it becomes a problem that affects everyone.<p>To say that the issues only occur in large metropolitan areas does not completely exclude the iPhone itself from being a contributing factor.",1260760099

NP are dying breed simply because its inconvenient.<p>If you already have cable tv and internet, NP is another way of getting the same news but much later when news has been beaten to death by other news source. Its not fast enough, you don't get instant update or instant follow-up. You have to wait for next day to get follow up on an interesting news, by the time you get update on that news; its already old stuff.<p>Comics and puzzle is not good enough to sell newspaper.<p>Newspaper has a special place in my childhood memory. I grew up reading multiple newspapers a day, waited anxiously for comics or movie reviews. It made sense then.

You need a few hours to start printing papers, so let's say all articles have to be in by 2 PM. Then you need time to let people write articles and analysis and whatnot. So you wouldn't really be reporting on things that happened during the day - it would only really be events that happened in the morning in the US, late at night in Asia and towards the end of the day in Europe. Seems to me that there's not enough of a market for that..",1260759805

3298862,comment,3297788,3298818,2,0,lmkg,,,"Personally, I classify any sort of sequence comprehension as a DSL, including LINQ and python's list and generator comprehensions. JQuery is basically as close to a LINQ-like DSL as you can get in a language like JavaScript that doesn't have metaprogramming support. Related to sequence comprehensions, there is Common Lisp's controversial LOOP macro, which is basically an iteration comprehension DSL.<p>I'm somewhat on the fence about whether format control strings qualify as DSL's. They don't as much, but they tend to have very complicated and specialized syntax.<p>I feel that Monads are a DSL in Haskell, but whenever I see ""Monads in Blub!"" I don't feel the same way about them. Part of it is probably that Haskell provides not only infix operators, but do-notation for supporting monads. Part of it is also that monads don't do as much in other languages, because their type systems aren't rich enough to fully express them, nor restrictive enough that their capabilities are useful.",1322728446

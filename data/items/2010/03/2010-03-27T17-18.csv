You make it sound like the enslavement, genocide and the systematic extermination of their culture and national language was a charity. You must mean the railroads they very generously set down in order to hasten the exportation of their crops (which the Irish slaved to harvest) in order to feed the rest of their empire while the Irish themselves starved, this even while the only crop they could afford to consume witnessed a blight, killing 2 million of them and forcing another 2 million to emigrate. They could though leave their religion and change their name as a token to bear this witness for a single bowl of soup if they wished so perhaps this is also the mixed bag you speak of.<p>I must tell you too, the infighting was and is not religiously motivated. This is a common mistake. The fight is and was between nationalists (those who desire an Irish republic) and loyalists (those British settlers and their offspring who desire British rule). Their religious affiliations are an aside.",1269712479

It's subtle, but it feels like the argument you put forth implies the colonized were lesser than the British in a fundamental sense.  Hence why I said ""inflammatory and libelous"" feelings are justified.  You also gloss over a lot of complex issues in regards to the Empire itself (which I wrote about here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1223286"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1223286</a>).<p>As a general rule, you're not wrong in the sense that a strong government can provide stability to a region.  But it's important to remember the native population had no role in government.  They never were taught how to govern by the British or allowed to develop their own methods of governing, because it was the British intention that their colonies always be dependent on Britain.  The collapse after British withdrawal backs this up I think.  Had the native population played a larger role in governing themselves or been given the freedom to develop their own system, they might have been able to create a stable government after Britain left.<p>There's also the fact that the British enslaved millions while building their empire.  The military that created the stability you admire was paid for by the lives of millions of Africans.  Seems like there is something wrong about glorifying that stability, given how it came about.<p>I guess what I'm trying to get at is that the stability provided by the British Empire was a false and immoral stability.  But factually your right that there was <i>some</i> temporary stability.  That said, you can stabilize a region by enslaving <i>everyone</i> if you wanted to.  Clearly there is a continuum for moral and immoral ways to stabilize a region.  It's my belief British colonialism leans more towards the immoral side, but I understand where you are coming from.<p>Sorry, that was stream of consciousness haha.  I know it's not well formed.<p>EDIT:<p><i>Is there a way I can put that point of view out there straightforwardly without tweaking people?</i><p>I'm not sure.  I think there is something important to what you are saying, but it is difficult to frame it without implying that the colonized are inferior.  There are positive things to say about the British system of government yes, but who's to say the native populations wouldn't have developed something just as good given the chance?  Do I wish all the lives in Africa since the British withdrawal could be brought back?  Yes.  Do I think subjecting the entire African continent to British rule for two centuries is a fair price to pay for that?  I'm not sure.  Ultimately African nations need to learn (with international help) how to govern on their own.",1269712206

Kids ""get"" patterns; what they struggle with is algorithms applied to symbols.<p>I went through ""normal"" school and was always way ahead in math.  My Montessori-educated sister, 3 years younger than me and not particularly mathematically inclined, could intelligently converse with me about my algebra homework when I was in sixth grade and she was in third.

Although you're right to point out that Iraq has more social infrastructure to begin with, that social infrastructure provides resources to ""the other side"" as well as ""our side"".<p>In other words, I think that there being less of a foundation to build on in Africa is actually beneficial -- even after considering Barnett's point, and agreeing with it. I think it's beneficial because it allows us to more easily provide resources to impoverished people without having to fight them for it. Think about it: there are no schools to blow up in some of these areas, so we can build them from scratch and introduce education to a population that hasn't had it.<p>I [EDIT: don't] think it's right to say ""we don't know how to do that""; though Barnett may say the same thing, I think it's more of a statement that ""we don't do that"". Certainly Barnett has some good ideas about doing that, as do some aspects of the U.N. and organizations like the Peace Corps.<p>To underline my point: Iraq did indeed have a uniformed army, police, and some government -- and it is the remnants of those things which we are still fighting in that country to this day, and <i>that's</i> why Africa would be easier to administrate.",1269711676

That's just not [EDIT: always] true.<p>Slavery was the core of the British empire in the West Indies and many other areas until it was abolished in the early 1800s.  I'm not sure you can claim the safety provided by slavery is valid and without corruption.  Slavery is by definition corrupt.  No longer able to use slavery to control the population of colonies, Britain opted to smuggle Opium into China (in defiance of Chinese law I might add).  This eventually lead to the collapse of the Qing Dynasty. Not exactly the kind of stability you claim the British Empire provided.<p>Hell, even today the British Empire is responsible for a lot of conflict in the world.  Kashmir, Palestine, Sudan?

""<p>You have no idea what you are speaking about.  ""serious decline in prosperity""? yeah right. If you can prove that you should  get the next Nobel prize for economics.<p><i>No one</i> in India wants the British back. While we have our problems, we are <i>more</i> prosperous , have <i>less</i> religious violence than when the British were here.  (to be clear, we do have religious violence. I'd like data for ""less"", since you seem so confident). The British Raj was hardly some kind of genteel and benevolent rule. It was highly exploitative and highly repressive.<p>The Bengal Famine resulted in the deaths of 3 <i>million</i> people,largely due to British policy.<p>from wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943</a>)<p>""During the British rule in India there were approximately 25 major famines spread through states such as Tamil Nadu in South India, Bihar in the north, and Bengal in the east; altogether, between 30 and 40 million Indians were the victims of famines in the latter half of the 19th century (Bhatia 1985).<p>Though malnutrition and hunger remain widespread in India, there have been no famines since the end of the British rule in 1947 and the establishment of a democratic government.""<p>Decline in prosperity? You have no idea, you arrogant idiot.<p>If you are arguing that the Germans, say, would have been worse than the British,  I agree, but that isn't what you were saying.<p>You make two points.  one, that all former British colonies has inevitably declined   when the British ruled it is laughable when applied to India (it might be true when applied to some African countries that have since fallen into anarchy).<p>We have our problems sure, but we are <i>way</i> better off than under British rule.<p>""resurgence of the caste system"" my ass. The caste system while still present and still harmful is <i>way</i> less powerful than in the period under British rule. You have no idea what you are speaking about.<p>Anothe point is that unlike Egypt (say, or even Hong Kong) we didn't move from British rule to more autocracy, but toward more freedom. Indians are more free today then <i>ever</i> under British rule.<p>The other point is   ""If I was alive in the times of the British Empire, I'm pretty sure I'd want to be under British rule.""<p>Sure, if you were British. An independence movement (like the Indian Independence movement) by <i>definition</i> consists of people who lived during british rule and <i>didn't</i> want to.  But by your logic all of them would have wanted to live under British rule forever. Millions of Indians sacrificed a great deal  to kick the british <i>out</i>.

1223236,comment,1223025,1223025,0,0,BornInTheUSSR,,,"Maybe you're already doing this, but you generally want to optimize the funnels from impression -> click -> landing-page -> some conversion event.  Focus on one at a time.  To get better click-through rates, ensure that you have tight integration in your ad groups between the keywords and the ad copy.  If you're not using keywords people are searching for in the ad, it is much less likely to be clicked.  Also try dynamic keyword insertion in the ad copy if you don't feel like breaking up your ad groups.  It's a bit of work, but once you find a combination that is effective, it's a matter of continuing to test new keyword permutations and dropping the stinkers to laser-target your adwords campaigns for high ROI.<p>It is also generally a bad idea to include price in the ad copy.  You want to give enough honest information about what you're selling to make an interested user click; it is the job of your landing page/web site to build value and sell, but test to see what works for you.

This allows for very granular commits if you are trying to keep good history/notes in your commit messages.  This also allows you to easily commit changes specific to what you are trying to accomplish with the commit.  I prefer small commits with comments specific to the changes rather than ""well its working, time to commit everything"".

You actually quoted me -<p>> This is what you said: Say what you like about colonialism, but this kind of shit never happened under the British Empire. They'd come in, kill the local armies and resistance, then they'd start building roads, hospitals, and schools and generally managing their territories fairly well.<p>Cutting off people's lips and ears, and arms, and mass rapes, and general brutal chaos - that didn't happen under British rule. By ""say what you like about colonialism..."", I mean that I don't think it's all roses and there were legitimate problems with it. However, I think peaceful, stable, prosperous colonial rule is one far superior option to bloodbath and no rule of law. Maybe it's not the best option, but it's certainly not all bad either.<p>> You then linked to a map of the British colonies and few short comments about a few countries<p>I tried to cover all of the Empire. Did I miss anywhere? They did some bad things - the largest was religious persecution in favor of the Church of England. Some of the monopoly Crown trading companies were bad. Tariffs and shipping laws were corrupt by modern standards; though, on the other hand, the British Navy did a very good job of protecting their territories' ships, transports, and people from pirates and raiders which was a very big problem back then. So it's a mixed thing. Again, not all roses.<p>> Burma was literally the wealthiest country in Asia under British rule - For the ruling white minority.<p>Okay, historically, the ruling minority has always done well everywhere. Pretty much everywhere in history was still reasonably comfortable for the ruling minority. That said, I actually just did a lot of reading about Burma recently because I was debating going there. The common people were <i>much</i> better off, wealthier, safer, and more free under British rule than they have been since. The biggest thing the British do well (that the Romans also did) is they let the local people keep their customs and cut off almost all local factional infighting. Burma has many different ethnicities of people in it, that have historically killed, raped, and pillaged each other with abandon. The period of the least amount of this was under British rule, when it was reasonably safe to be of any ethnicity, and you had almost complete religious freedom, and infinitely more free speech than you do today, along with much more free action, freedom of mobility, economic freedom, and economic prosperity. Burma was a hell of a lot better under British rule, almost infinitely so, for almost everyone in society. The British traders and governors there got wealthy, so did the local people, and they all lived exceptionally well. Again though, I might take issue with trade monopolies and tariffs as one of the worst things about the British Empire, so some of that ruling elite wealth was ill-gotten. True, but on balance, Burma was exceptionally better off under British rule, for everyone there.<p>> Britishness as a metric of success .. wasn't half of Canada French? did they fare worse?<p>But I didn't say Britishness was a metric of success - I said they used the British systems and turned out well. Common law, classic international trade law, reasonably open borders and consular protection, free markets, well-equipped and well-trained hierarchical professional military, limited powers with checked and balances - these are good systems. There's other good systems - I actually like the Napoleonic Codes from France, and prefer civil law to modern common law. So there's other alternatives, sure. But I point out, you could do a heck of a lot worse than installing the basic English governing system in a place.<p>> The crooked King Farouk was a womenizing gambler and European puppet.<p>This is a little ""No True Scotsman"", no? I'm saying British colonial rule was superior to what came after it, you're saying, ""Well, it doesn't count because he was a womanizing gambler and puppet."" Well, yes, I might agree. Colonial rule is better than womanizing gambling puppet rule. The assumption that !colonialism = goodgovernment just doesn't hold. Many places threw off colonialism and descended into something much worse. The places that didn't descend into worse largely kept the British system - common law, trade, military, habeas corpus, constitution, professional military, etc, etc.<p>> If you think English colonization is the true recipe for success, look at Turkey :-) Never been colonized, and fares better than all the colonies in its neighborhood.<p>Ah, so you point out that colonization is flawed by choosing one of the three most badass colonial empires of all time? Right, Turkey was a colonial power for over 600 years, only ending with WWI. Rome, Britain, China, and Ottoman were the four most successful empires in history. Also, it should be noted that Mustafa Ataturk did not serve the will of the people - I'm a huge admirer of his, and he went outright against the spirit of his times, ended the Caliphate, and basically forcefully modernized Turkey against the people's wishes, with free speech, free religion, a secular government, and other such modernities - these were actually not wanted and resisted by his people; his rule was tenuous in the beginning as a military dictatorship, opening up only later. But he was a great man, he's why Turkey became what it is instead of going the way of Germany after WWI. He's worth reading about if you haven't read about him, Ataturk was a great man.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk</a><p>> Very safe to say that in the internet. After a thousand years, English occupation loses its novelty. I wonder how happy are the Irish with it?<p>I'm part Irish and I said Ireland was a mixed bag. I'm not sure that's exactly an unsafe thing to say in person, considering a good many of my relatives are Irish and I spent time in Dublin. But yeah, you've got some Oliver Cromwell type stuff, and some Church of England type stuff that was terrible. It's a black mark on the British record.<p>To be clear, I'm not saying the British Empire is the greatest thing ever. There were problems. But many regions had their most prosperous times under British rule, for the people on the bottom, and the middle class, and the wealthy. But I'm not arguing for the British Empire, it's just an example I picked of good colonial governance. I'm a supporter of good governance, not colonialism itself. The Dutch, for instance, would brutally massacre the people they colonized, which is one reason they have very few friendly ties with anywhere they used to rule. The Spanish, likewise, were more interested in plundering and converting than establishing good government and live-and-let-living. But Rome, Britain, a couple of the Muslim Empires, a couple of the Chinese Empires, and so on - they brought good government to people. Maybe self government is better than foreign government, but if forced to choose, I'll take good foreign government over bad self government any day of the week.",1269709542

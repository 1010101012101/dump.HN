Maybe it is a waste of effort for many scenarios, but if you can do it well, you can still add all sorts of algorithms to pick the best recommedations from the predictions?",1238392756

538232,comment,538067,538228,0,0,blackguardx,,,"They are pretty good for that. Honestly, if you didn't want to go through the trouble to get a PCB fabbed by a commercial PCB vendor, wire wrap is a pretty good choice for simple circuits.<p>When I do that simple stuff like that, I use wires and solder instead of a wire wrap tool. Wire wrap might be a little faster.<p>If you want to prototype high speed analog/RF circuits without PCBs, take a look at ""dirty"" or ""dead-bug"" construction. HAM guys love it for building radios. You assemble your circuit over a piece of bare copper-clad board and solder the pins either directly together or short pieces of wire. People do this with both SMT and thru-hole parts.<p>Jim Williams has a great tutorial on this technique:\n<a href=""http://www.linear.com/pc/downloadDocument.do?navId=H0,C1,C1154,C1009,C1028,P1219,D4138"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linear.com/pc/downloadDocument.do?navId=H0,C1,C11...</a>",1238392498

538221,comment,538157,538215,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That's also a bit of a misinterpretation - nobody can learn <i>all programming</i>, particularly not in 10 years.  Heck, it's basically impossible to keep up with just the programming going on in the Googleplex, because new knowledge is created faster than anyone can learn it.  Just keeping up with the new features and best practices for the <i>webserver</i> used on the <i>search</i> property (that's one component of one product) is basically a full-time job.<p>Rather, 10 years is how long it takes to become an <i>expert</i> in programming.  Someone who's base of knowledge is broad and deep enough that he can form new connections between subject areas that advance the state of the art.  Basically, the amount of time it takes to do useful, creative, original work.<p>Expertise in a bunch of programming languages is a necessary but not sufficient part of that.  Hell, I know at least half a dozen languages, including OO, functional, macros, coroutines, parallelism, etc.  I've been working seriously at being a programmer for about 5 years (plus dabbling with occasional programs since I was 10 - that's another 12 years).  But Norvig's definition also includes significant domain knowledge, and having experienced all phases of the lifecycle of a project, and knowing what other people value in code, and fundamental algorithm knowledge, and plenty of other stuff besides languages.",1238390927

Most of the sites that offered video back then all had some funky player that required downloading some codec that only worked half the time. Youtube just worked everywhere thanks to Flash. If they had gone with a less ubiquitous format, even if they had all the other features they mention, I don't think it would be what it is today.<p>The biggest take away for me from this was just how recent this whole video UGC thing is. Its hard to imagine a world without YouTube now.",1238390485

For big projects, drilling out all the vias or thru-holes is tedious. There are also registration issues and etch time issues.<p>There is a reason why commercially made prototype circuit boards are so popular.",1238390341
538215,comment,538157,538157,0,0,smanek,,,"He misinterprets Norvig. The author claims that Norvig said:\n""it takes about ten years to develop expertise in [a programming language]."" The author then goes to say Norvig was wrong, and he explains why.<p>Norvig really said that it takes ten years to learn programming. There is a difference. Norvig explicitly includes learning half a dozen languages (including one OO language, one functional language, one with macros, one with coroutines, one with parallelism, and so on). Norvig's 10 years is how long it takes to learn <i>all</i> programming. After following his program, you should have expertise in pretty much every major paradigm and style, and be able to pick up any new language quickly.",1238390287

With careful PCB layout, you can create circuits that operate at microwave frequencies due to the lower parasitics.<p>Wire wrap circuits can't operate at high frequencies. There is too much series inductance and cross-coupling.<p>Also, chips are increasingly moving towards surface mount only packaging.<p>By the way, where are you getting your wire wrap supplies?

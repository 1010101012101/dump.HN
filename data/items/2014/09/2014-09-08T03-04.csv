It is a significant advance.<p>Yet, the Wikipedia editors continuously delete the Nimrod programming language article, claiming Nimrod is &quot;not notable&quot;.<p>Wikipedia editors will say that there aren&#x27;t enough third party articles or something, but that isn&#x27;t true.  And then they will say, yes, this is notable compared to quite a lot of other garbage or trivia that has articles on Wikipedia, but just because &quot;other crap exists&quot; isn&#x27;t an excuse to allow this article.<p>I think that notability has to be a relative concept, and Nimrod is notable.  At this point its just small-dick Wikipedia editors asserting their control.  Either that or some editors are invested in other programming languages and are trying to stop this one from becoming mainstream.<p>This proves to me that Wikipedia is utter crap.  But unfortunately, we are stuck with Wikipedia and it has quite a lot of influence.  I wish someone who had pull on Wikipedia or knew how to make it work would fix this problem.  I have tried.  It seems like maybe it actually just made the editors band together more to try to continue to keep it off, just as sort of a reaction.

But the smaller the gate the worse the transistor is at being able to turn off the current and leakage current starts to become an issue. This is the main issue that is killing Moore&#x27;s law as we are no longer able to ignore leakage current as it becomes more and more dominant to the entire power budget. This along with increased density of the circuits also cause risk of thermal runaway. These factors mean that as we shrink geometries the transistor architecture has to get more and more exotic (while still being manufacturable) to deal with these issues. So, yes the switching power is decreased but EVERYTHING else gets much more complicated.",1410148064

Motorola inexplicably chose an ancient 1GHz single-core Texas Instruments OMAP 3 SoC to power the 360. For some perspective, that&#x27;s a 2010-era processor in the same league as the iPhone 4 or Nexus One. Smartwatch processors don&#x27;t need to be as powerful as their smartphone companions, but there is no reason for them to be old. It&#x27;s almost as if Motorola raided a dumpster outside the TI factory for parts.<p>Haha, this is a good joke. Why do you need to have so much CPU power for a smatchwatch anyway, that won&#x27;t be driving tons of pixels every microsecond ? What&#x27;s really the issue there?

If an unbiased third-party, then observes the groups (still without knowledge of which group had which treatment), and if one group shows markedly different results (say, 490/500 of the treatment group recover, and only 10/500 placebo group recover), is it fair to say that in this particular scenario, that correlation of recovery with the treatment implied that the treatment caused the recovery?",1410147261

8283312,comment,8282780,8283208,8,0,lpmay,,,"Depending on the context, your friend may be right.<p>Power dissipation in a CMOS gate is made up of two primary components: static leakage and dynamic losses.  Dynamic losses are related to the &quot;dissipation&quot; capacitance (Cdiss or Cpd in CMOS datasheets) and the switching frequency. If you want to understand why, consider charging an RC circuit.  How much energy is lost to the resistor and how much is stored in the capacitor at the end of charging?  How does the selection of the resistor and capacitor value impact this ratio?<p>So for minimum <i>dynamic</i> loss you want to minimize Cdiss which involves making gates as small as possible.  However, this makes the static leakage higher.  So it may not be universally as simple as &quot;a smaller process is lower power&quot;. For a system which spends most of it&#x27;s time in sleep, or clocks slowly it may actually be better to eat the dynamic loss of a larger process in order to get the lower leakage, which is something I believe TI did with some of the FRAM &#x27;430 parts (but I can&#x27;t find the link now).",1410146612

In other words, I would not think this because I can do basic math.<p>>> &quot;But the only KKK member to be elected to the Senate, Robert Byrd, was Democrat, and he retired in 2010, not 1960.&quot;<p>Not exactly true. Byrd dropped his membership in 1952, as he was running for the House, where he served from 1953 until 1959, when he ran for the Senate. But this is hardly relevant, since it all took place a decade or two before the great political realignment triggered by LBJ.<p>>> &quot;I don&#x27;t know why you call them &quot;Dixiecrats&quot;.<p>Because that&#x27;s what pro-segregation southern Democrats are called. And because that&#x27;s exactly who we&#x27;re talking about. So you know, &quot;Dixiecrat&quot; was the informal name used by a short-lived, pro- segregationist breakaway faction from the Democratic party. The group flamed out in 1948, but the name hung around, finally sticking to the southern, white, and openly racist Democrats who were vehemently opposed to the Civil Rights Act and who subsequently formed the core of today&#x27;s predominantly Southern GOP - which is <i>precisely</i> who we&#x27;re talking about here.<p>>> “There is simply no evidence there was a mass conversion from Democrats to Republicans in the South.&quot;<p>Um, wow. Where do I even begin? I mean, saying something this demonstrably wrong is a bit like saying &quot;There&#x27;s no evidence that the Earth is round,&quot; or &quot;There&#x27;s no evidence that the Titanic really sunk,&quot; or &quot;There&#x27;s no evidence that Boston is north of New York City.&quot;<p>I could go on, but you get the point. And yes, there&#x27;s is <i>lots</i> (and lots and lots and lots) of evidence there was a mass conversion from Democrats to Republicans in the South. Chiefly, the <i>public record of election results for the United States of America</i>.<p>Here&#x27;s but one summary of the shift. Scroll down for the helpful charts that document the shift on a year by year basis. The section you want to pay especially close attention to is marked &quot;1964 Election – Regional Realignment&quot;.<p><a href=""http://mattsmaps.wordpress.com/2011/07/14/southern-realignment-nears-completion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mattsmaps.wordpress.com/2011/07/14/southern-realignme...</a><p>Again, this shift <i>started</i> in the Civil Rights era. It grew under Reagan, and it went ballistic in the 1990s, as you correctly note. Like I said originally, this didn&#x27;t happen overnight. It took about three decades to unfold, by which time the home of southern, white voters who are generally opposed to strong civil rights legislation has completed its swing from the Democratic party to the GOP.<p>Today, the South is solidly Republican. In general, Democrats don’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of representing these states. Indeed, this is where they face their very toughest odds. And that’s not because there’s been some sea change in the population, culture, attitudes, or beliefs commonly held by white people in the American southeast. It’s because the party that was once aligned with their interests abandoned them, and because the party that once opposed those interests was captured and radically changed by them.<p>I accept this change, by the way. These shifts are par for the course in American politics. What I don’t accept is present day Republicans who try to deflect well-grounded charges of racism by claiming that they’re members of “the party of Lincoln” while ignoring the near-perfect realignment in the major party’s respective bases that happened between now and then. It&#x27;s like somebody who has had a sex change trying to insist that they were born in their current state. I don&#x27;t object to the operation. I do object to the lying.<p>Seriously, if the point your making only sounds convincing to people with zero grasp of history, then what you&#x27;re asserting is just straigh-up bullshit, which is like lying, except worse.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit</a><p>So you know, honest, intelligent, decent people who respect the truth don&#x27;t behave like that.

This you not knowing your ass from your elbow, behaving in an intellectually dishonest fashion, and getting schooled accordingly. So you know, debates revolve around opinions, ideas, and perspectives. What we&#x27;re talking about here are matters of well-established (i.e. non-debatable) fact.",1410145645

For instance, we can look back at the past and realize that choices were made in certain situations that were flat out in opposition to reality, and in such a way that the people of the time KNEW (or had the tools to know) that it was the wrong choice.  Looking at present society through this kind of lens, ignoring social convention and analyzing things objectively, is, I think, helpful.  For instance, it would not surprise me if within 100 years our current culture is looked down upon for being extremely oppressive and prejudiced against adolescents, harming them tremendously by denigrating them during a very formative period of their lives.  It follows the pattern of every form of prejudice we have overthrown in the past.  We view ourselves as superior, construct very poor scientific arguments for that superiority, and go about enacting great oppression, controlling the group &#x27;for their own good&#x27; while expecting the worst of them (humans react poorly to oppression, so this expectation will be met).<p>Similarly, it is very likely that we will find many of the general ideas we have about sexuality will be shown to be very destructive and unhealthy.  Our research already shows that increasing sexual activity by any amount results in real measurable health benefits.  And history can show us that we exist in the most non-sexually-active period in human history.  We&#x27;ll certainly correct that at some point, history pretty much guarantees it.  Wherever our society is a freakish unique outlier on something as basic as that, I think it&#x27;s safe to expect it to be shown to be folly later.",1410145255

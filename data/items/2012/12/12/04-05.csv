Common Lisp systems were offered in 1984 maybe.<p>Commercialization of Common Lisp was huge on Unix from day one. Lucid was a commercial vendor. You might want to read the description of RIchard P. Gabriel of its business. Franz is a commercial vendor on Unix. Harlequin was one / now Lispworks. When Steve Jobs sold his first NeXTStation, a copy of Allegro CL was included. Every major Unix vendor in the 80s sold a Common Lisp implementation. SUN had the Symbolic Programming Environment (SPE). HP. IBM. Most of the major Lisp software of that day got ported to Unix (some also to Windows). Macsyma ran on Unix and Windows. KEE on Unix. Knowledge Craft. G2. etc etc.<p>Franz describes their history: <a href=""http://www.franz.com/about/company.history.lhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.franz.com/about/company.history.lhtml</a><p>Lucid:\n<a href=""http://www.dreamsongs.com/DiBona-OReillyLetter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamsongs.com/DiBona-OReillyLetter.html</a><p>RPG writes: from 1984 until 1988/89 we were the premier provider of Common Lisp.",1355288285

Don't bother with embedded http server or rpc etc. Add a --daemonize option (it's _really_ not too complicated) for customers who don't like crontab. And finally customers who don't want to run your agent can write their own against your published API. Maybe they don't want out bound http directly from their db. They could implement different transport and have a shim to your API service.<p>PS: keep batching in mind when doing API.

But then, I've been using Django for a few years now and know the ins and outs quite well.<p>I can see how you'd be enticed by a simpler framework such as webapp2 or Flask as a starting point.

I started thinking about doing something similar a few months ago, but the project I needed it for kind of fell through and I moved on. Anyway, a few thoughts I had at the time:<p><pre><code>  -should support FFT/convolution\n  -could tie into http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/ for\n   vector/matrix stuff (excellent library!)\n    -I emailed jcoglan about the possibility of adding\n     complex number support to Sylvester, he encouraged me\n     to try but thought it might introduce too much function\n     call overhead (caching function results might help a\n     bit?)\n  -I didn't get to look at it too closely, but\n   https://github.com/jtobey/javascript-bignum looks\n   interesting, as does https://github.com/pr1001/MathPlus\n  -polynomial fit (least squares regression) and\n   interpolation stuff is in high demand\n  -it should be super easy to integrate output with d3.js\n   (like the equivalent of MATLAB plot function)\n</code></pre>\nHonestly, I doubt I would have been able to pull it off, but I intend to contribute to this project as much as I can.<p>EDIT: Formatting",1355285257

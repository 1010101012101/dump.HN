Google have redrawn the traditional lines separating commercial activity, academic research, and public service.<p>Speaking of Google books, our local university library has many books available online, especially up-to-date research literature that is hard to get in print form. You can only read this stuff if you're sitting at a workstation in the library, or if you have a student/faculty account. That's reasonable. But they use proprietary e-book software that is so awful and clunky that it's unusable. I keep thinking about that crappy software company that was good at nothing but selling to university executives, and wishing the library could just cut a deal to use Google Books instead.",1268374003

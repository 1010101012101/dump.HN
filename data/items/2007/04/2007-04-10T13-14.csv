11256,comment,11189,11189,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"One of the reasons I asked this question is because recently I  participated in a webinar by marketingexperiments.com .  The folks at MEC said they tested three different price points for a product - $10, $12, $15 (something like that) and asked the audience, many of whom were marketing professionals, which price they thought performed the best.  The majority of them were wrong.<p>The moral, in that case, was that a marketer's instinct is a fine thing, but doing online testing gives you real knowledge of the situation.  By doing testing not only can you learn if your instinct is right, but you can glean information about your users/visitors as well.",1176213034

11253,comment,11189,11189,0,0,mdakin,,,"Back when I was in school I noticed a pattern emerge while taking tests over freshman year: If I changed a test answer a statistically HUGE amount of the time I changed it from the correct answer to an incorrect one.  After noticing this pattern I stopped second guessing myself!  ",1176212634
11252,comment,11189,11216,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Another way to frame the idea would be to rely more on your subconscious - all those automatic responses to situations based on a lifetime of experience.  This is standard practice for designers who spend a great deal of time absorbing the aspects of a problem at hand, then put it aside.  A minute/hour/day/week later comes the Aha!, a subconsciously formed integration solving the problem.  (No magic involved).   <p>One experiment I tried was for a very large multiple choice test.  (For the Architect exam, 3 days of 10 hour tests).  I found that when taking the practice test, 95% of the time that I went back and changed an answer, thinking I had answered it wrong the first time, I actually changed it from right to wrong.  So for the actual test, I went through the test once only with one answer, left hours before every one else, and aced it.  The moral: The Subconscious is a good thing - you can rely on it.",1176212627

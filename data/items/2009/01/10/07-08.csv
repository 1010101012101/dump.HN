Sure, it's a centralized place to get mobile software, but it's not hard at all to find software online for other platforms (Palm, Windows Mobile,etc.).  If anything, the App Store with its renowned restrictions, simply limits the number of interesting applications released for the iPhone.  It may be good for the developers, I can't argue that point, although I don't understand why it would be.\nAnd about ""success.""  The Razr had enjoyed more ""success"" than the iPhone by how you must be measuring success.  I measure success by how satisfied I am with the phone, even if no one else bought the thing.  I'm not saying the Palm Pre will be great, because there's no way to know.",1231574082

So you're in the top quartile, for me, of Ask HN stuff here.  Praise aside, let's get to the helpful specific crits:<p>You really need to Photoshop the pictures in your quiz to make them as standard and innocuous as possible.  Telling people to ignore the floors, walls, etc. is just impossible.  Ideally, you'd be able to stage your own photos.<p>Also, the interface needs to be 1) consistent and 2) less cluttered.  I'd recommend really blowing it out with whitespace to figure out what you need and don't, then incrementally making it tighter.  CrazyEgg might be super-helpful to you given that you have a very visual site.<p>As for ""going viral"", having quick page loads is necessary but not sufficient.  You can make the page load quicker.",1231573970

This is why almost all shopping carts these days use 1-2-3 style steps. The technical term (from User eXperience) is scent, and it's what gives the user a continued incentive to keep going.<p>I almost quit the StyleEngine until I saw that, but I almost didn't see it at all.",1231573921

Can a software tool make that easier or more transparent?",1231573895
427771,story,,,16,10,unalone,"Ask HN: How do you create a ""limited fixed div""?",,"I feel a bit embarrassed asking an HTML/JavaScript question, but this is tough because I don't know exactly how you'd describe this effect easily.<p>What I'm looking to do is create a div that moves along with the user's scrolling - exactly how a fixed div does - but that only does so within the confines of a certain space. I have a site design that's split into two pieces. I want the div to move within the top space, stop when it gets to the bottom space. After that it quits moving down.<p>How would I get this to work? The problem is, I'm not at all familiar with using JavaScript to manipulate physical location, so I'm not certain how exactly I'd make this solution. And, to the best of my knowledge, this isn't something that HTML/CSS can do on its own: fixed is all-or-nothing.",1231573536

When I was building white label digital music download shops, iTunes was constantly the thing that haunted our every move.<p>The seamless iPod -> iTunes integration is a killer feature. While I think it's not an insurmountable barrier I think it's definitely a factor. They don't just have to beat the iPhone they also need to beat parts of iTunes.",1231572157

427758,comment,427740,427740,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Nice article, but I have one thing to say: your list of priorities for features is probably what you <i>think</i> you want. Before I got the iPhone, I never browsed the internet on my Treo because the experience was just absolutely terrible (the experience on blackberry is also terrible). Now I browse the web on my iPhone more than I use it as a phone.<p>While investigating how to make the best UI, I've found that people's priorities come from their habits and not necessarily from their needs. At first this seemed kind of illogical to me. But if you think about it, before the iPhone, no normal people really could imagine a mobile browser as good as mobile Safari, so no one really put ""a desktop experience web browser"" at the top of their requirements lists for phones (obviously tech people did, but average people did not).<p>I wonder what would happen if you bought an iPhone.",1231571594

427753,comment,427292,427663,0,0,unalone,,,"You could say the same thing about every character ever written. They're all extensions of the author. Even a character as complex as, say, Stephen Dedalus, is in the end a product entirely of his creator's mind. One of the catches of reading fiction is that you always need to remember that they are the product of a single mind.<p>> There is certainly a lot to be said for enlightened self interest and personal freedom, but the absolutism of objectivism is just as wrong as communism.<p>But which <i>concept</i> is better? When you subscribe to an idea you do it for the practical idea of it. Communism says that you should put everybody in front of you, and do what everybody else thinks you should. (Or rather, subjectivism does, since that's the true opposite of Objectivism; Communism rather states that the community is more important than the individual, which is closer to subjectivism.) Objectivism says that you should rely on yourself to do what's right. The one is much healthier mentally, and that's a good sign.",1231571128

I don't really want to work with an entity whose income isn't really determined by the satisfaction of their customers.

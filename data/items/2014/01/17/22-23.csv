7079048,comment,7077883,7078602,2,0,Zancarius,,,"> I mean, one of the principal challenges of empirical data analysis is putting together data from disparate sources in order to come to actionable analysis. One doesn&#x27;t just publish the data that&#x27;s easy to come by and then call it a day.<p>I thought it was curious how the most dangerous &quot;toy&quot; is the bicycle. I suppose that&#x27;s not surprising, but other charts indicate that the greatest hazard to children is choking. I&#x27;d wager it&#x27;s difficult to choke on a bicycle save for disassembling it and ravenously ingesting the smaller parts.<p>Given the CPSC&#x27;s recent history (think Buckyballs), I also wonder if the relative number of product recalls has increased due to changes in regulation, changes specific to the CPSC itself (organizational, leadership, mission, etc), or increased pressure from consumer/physician groups.<p>Products containing lead appear to be responsible for a sizable portion of the recalls, but I&#x27;m not completely sure I agree with the implicit suggestion that modern toys are somehow more dangerous based on recalls alone.

7079041,comment,7076632,7077391,2,0,eevilspock,,,"You say Libertarians are focused on &quot;unjust property laws&quot;, but sadly most Libertarians these days seem to be royal libertarians, supporting land as private property where the owner is 100% sovereign and are opposed to such things as inheritance tax on land. If you agree with the arguments of this article (I do), this is fundamentally unjust property law. People who don&#x27;t own land are at the mercy of land owners and so are not free.

IO looked like lazy streams of events, but it was pretty messy and pretty possible to deadlock, from what I hear.  Writing modern Haskell, doing IO without any use of the IO <i>type</i> isn&#x27;t possible, but you can - in principle - avoid ever using the fact that it&#x27;s a monad by simply calling unsafePerformIO immediately on any IO action.

You&#x27;ll never do anything interesting at any age if you decide to take on big challenges based on others opinions, and there are naysayers at every age.  But also, the fact is that if someone says they&#x27;re going to do some amazing huge thing I will be polite but I will probably not believe they can actually pull it off until they do so.  This has nothing to do with my life experience, but just that talk is cheap and people like to dream. It&#x27;s just a statistical fact that on average there&#x27;s a lot more talk than execution, or perhaps a better way to look at it is that one ambitious idea might take 10 years of full-time dedication to execute successfully during which time who knows how many more lightbulbs would come on.<p>But perhaps more to your point, what does my experience tell me about bold ambitions?  Well, mostly I&#x27;ve learned that making big predictions is foolish.  The older I get the more I discover how extremely subjective life is, and how dependent everything we know and take for granted is based on personal experience and perspective.  I&#x27;m much less likely today at 35 to predict the outcome of a project than I would have at 25.  My experience comes in at a smaller scale on more specific issues.  Engineering choices for instance, I have a much finer tuned sense of where to balance hackery and YAGNI, or how to manage different kinds of business relationships.

Make sure you have knives, cutlery and bowls/plates; potentially more if you have people working silly hours (eg enough facilities to knock up a plate of food). Don&#x27;t baulk at supplying a minimum of tea/coffee/sugar/milk, nice water and potentially snacks too. If people are using the milk too quickly for whatever reason, it&#x27;s really simple; buy more.\nPrevious places have done Pizza Friday (weekly, monthly or quarterly) which is always nice. It brings the entire office together which is great for getting to know colleagues and amazing things can happen when distant arms of the business sit down together over food.<p>Be easy with timekeeping and have some sympathy for the length of people&#x27;s commute. This isn&#x27;t possible with all roles, but my current contract doesn&#x27;t have start/finish times or even an amount of hours in it -and it&#x27;s amazingly liberating. Lots of our people have silly commutes (I&#x27;m driving for about an hour and a quarter) but I don&#x27;t think anyone has a stressful one. Everyone (who&#x27;s in) tries to get in before 10am (we never schedule meetings earlier) so people arrive between 7-10 and tend to leave some time around 4-8. If you get stuck in traffic and end up running late then it&#x27;s annoying but it&#x27;s not _stressful_.<p>With the right team, this seems to work extraordinarily well. People are happy and healthy and personally invested in doing a good job and take pride in it. When a deadline looms, something serious breaks or even if you&#x27;ve just got happily engrossed in something interesting then no one bats at eyelid at being in the office at >10pm. We have an on-call rota, but most people have set up personal alert systems so we get notified when we&#x27;re not holding the phone -it&#x27;s a matter of pride and respect both to our customers but also to each other. -tldr: bosses often expect people to work late but all is doom if you&#x27;re not at your desk ten minutes before your official start time.<p>It&#x27;s very distancing and disjointing to know you can&#x27;t put anything down (from thoughts in a notebook, spare laptop charger, _my_ selection of random cds and usb sticks), basically make provision for future and be able to find it in weeks to come. I think physical carries across to the mental too; my brain finds it easier to resume from where it left jobs at home time when my general workspace is in the same state in the morning. At the very least people should be given a locker or a set of draws they control, especially if they&#x27;re out of the office for periods of time. In technical roles I find hotdesking and hot-computering sucks more balls than imaginable; it&#x27;s awful to the point where I actually used &quot;sucks more balls&quot; on HN. Oh, and if you have to refuse me local admin rights (and even if you don&#x27;t), give people a couple of VPSs in a safe DMZ that they have root (and snapshot/rollback ability) on.<p>Open office culture can be fantastic (your mileage (or relevancy) may vary), but please don&#x27;t think I mean stick everyone together in a big echoy room where you can&#x27;t hear yourself think. If you&#x27;re working on a laptop then really it shouldn&#x27;t matter where you&#x27;re doing it so make sure people get just as good wireless at their desk as in the office next door, the quiet room or outside next to the pond. Open culture should mean that no one is afraid to ask questions and that no one takes questioning personally and is willing to explain anything. If you&#x27;re having a meeting or discussion (that isn&#x27;t specifically private/privileged) then anyone is welcome to sit or wander in, listen and ask questions or offer explanations. Everyone gets to put forward their best ideas and then you pick them all apart with everyone else and hopefully all come to a consensus. Personally I love it when people see flaw in my &#x27;obvious&#x27; ideas well before I&#x27;ve tried implementing them and then explain exactly why it sounds great but here&#x27;s the key you missed -or simply, it&#x27;s nice to know we&#x27;ve got each others backs. All this relies on good people and good leadership, but when dev, ops, networking and even sales and management are all on the same page then great things will happen.<p>Night/Shift workers: If you&#x27;re a 24/7 operation then you&#x27;ve got people that work even odder times than the rest. Night and shift workers (I&#x27;ve seen 7-7  is relatively common and people end up out of sync with the rest of the business. Make sure they don&#x27;t miss out when people get fed or when the office comes together -these are the people keeping stuff going when everyone else is asleep or enjoying weekends; imho it deserves more respect than is usually awarded to it.",1389998219

7078934,comment,7076599,7077811,3,0,pron,,,"Java <i>currently</i> only stores primitives inline (in arrays or in objects). However, the memory allocation scheme (at least in HotSpot) places objects that are created one after another by the same thread consecutively in memory.<p>Nevertheless, cache-friendly data structures are still very much possible on the JVM. Consider something like a B-Tree node, with an array of references to the children and an array of keys. The node object and the arrays will be stored together in memory, so the only cache-missing pointer following you&#x27;d do is when you jump from one node to another, just as would happen in C/C++. So the memory placement is certainly not as flexible as in C/C++, but you can certainly be pretty cache friendly. In fact, this is a very active topic, as a lot of people are starting to use Java in low latency applications. For example, look at the discussions here: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechanical-sympathy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechanical-sympathy</a><p>There is work being done to support value types in Java, that are immutable, cannot be referenced (hence only compared by value), and stored inline in arrays (well, the latter is an implementation issue and up to the particular JVM to decide).

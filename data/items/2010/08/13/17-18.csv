Being a generalist, having experience with a lot of different disciplines, being self-taught those are all desirable qualities.<p>I also think that generalists make for good community managers, especially with a bit of experience developing and support. You're able to translate well and understand both the community's point of view and that of the developers.<p>With a few years of technical experience, if your resume isn't opening doors - for either experienced or entry level positions - I think it's worth considering some extra help.

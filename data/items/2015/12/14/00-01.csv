Boredom can definitely lead to study fatigue, but the people in this example were medical students preparing for a high-stakes board exam at a top-10 institution. Boredom might be less of an issue at this level - it&#x27;s more about efficiency and a tremendous feeling of stress and pressure. Indeed, several of these students who were in danger of failing were studying as much as 10-12 hours per day... essentially spinning their wheels in the mud.<p>That being said, combatting boredom is a really important thing to consider.",1450054776

I&#x27;m also Canadian and have worked in technology in SF, LA, NYC, Vancouver and Santiago Chile.<p>I have a very different perspective on this. Australia has had more than just one Atlassian. They&#x27;ve also got Campaign Monitor, BigCommerce, Canva, Where 2 (became Google Maps), Envato. Australia is also growing Freelancer (I don&#x27;t believe it was initially built here), and I&#x27;m sure many others.<p>Now, let&#x27;s look at the comment regarding the newly announced innovation strategy does provide lots (probably too much) money to incubators, but so has every country. The incubator thing is just not successful outside a the few outliers YC, TechStars and maybe 1 or 2 others.<p>However, one of the large components of the plan is tax incentives to early stage investors. There are also bankruptcy law reform. There is also a new Entrepreneur Visa.<p>Now, Silicon Valley will almost always have an advantage to the history and network there. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that Australia is &quot;a crappy place&quot; for tech business.<p>I find Australia a refreshing change from North America. There is a realistic view on revenue models, less money is &#x27;wasted&#x27; on poorly thought out businesses. Australians are bright resourceful people.<p>I think this is a great place to be in tech. It punches above it&#x27;s weight on the world stage.<p>If you look at regions with major technology successes, what do you end up with? A bunch in the US, a few in China, a few in India, a few in Canada, a few in Germany, a few in the UK. Where would Australia end up on a list of population vs. influence?

With your pricing a consumer using your product would only have to use it for 5 months before the self-hosted option becomes economically attractive.<p>To buy Photoshop CS6, alone, would cost $700. Adobe CC prices it at $9.99/mo - meaning you could use their CC option for 6 years before breaking even. In those 6 years, with CC you would get upgrades as well - OTOH even if you were to upgrade every 3 years, you wouldn&#x27;t break even.<p>IIRC, Master Collection was $3,000, and is now $600/yr. Meaning if you bought Master Collection you would break even with CC if you only upgraded 5 times a year.<p>To make your analogy more apt, you should price your non-cloud offering at $600, and then compare how many people prefer it to cloud.<p>Personally, I think their decision to end their standalone offering had more to do with simplifying DRM than anything.",1450054685

10728734,comment,10724309,10725521,0,0,chubot,,,"I like this analogy between reading and travel.  I&#x27;ve never heard the thesis that business is the only authentic way to travel -- but it appeals to me!  I have friends that travel to Asia for business, as well as those who go to Europe to drink and hang out.  Certainly there is a considerable difference between these modes of travel.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that reading for comprehension, or travelling for business are the ONLY way of doing those things.  That would be a bit presumptuous.  But they resonate with me.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to avoid is the ailment of unproductive information addiction.  Many people are complaining about this these days.  It happens with fiction too -- there was a piece in the NY Times Book Review awhile back, where the author was questioning why he was such a voracious reader, when he could seldom remember things he read.  He felt guilt at not remembering.  It&#x27;s even the case that some people forget THAT they read a book, not just the contents of the book...<p>To elaborate on reading, I feel like some good tests of whether reading was worthwhile are:<p>1) If I can build something that I couldn&#x27;t build before (usually programming, but sometimes other things).  This often requires concentrated reading from many difference sources, and following citations.<p>2) If the material comes up in a conversation, or an Internet forum like HN.  Being able to explain something in your own words, in a different context, means you actually understood it, rather than just passively consuming words.<p>3) If I&#x27;m reminded of it while reading something else, and especially if I&#x27;m compelled to make notes about it.  I have a wiki with 2300 HTML pages of notes, accumulated over 11 years.  Each page has dozens of links... if I manage to keep all this information relatively accessible, then I feel good.  I like when I make a link to a page/idea that hasn&#x27;t been touched in 2 years, 6 years, 10 years.  That means I&#x27;m adding some value over the long term.<p>Basically it boils down to connecting it to other things, so you are consuming ideas rather than just words.  I&#x27;m reminded of Paul Graham&#x27;s idea of &quot;forgetting who said something&quot; --  you are learning some truth, rather than just what one author happened to believe and happened to argue persuasively.<p>On travel, I always feel like a curmudgeon when I&#x27;m not excited about vacations.  In the &quot;social circles&quot; I seem to be in, vacations are somehow a mark of status.  People like to talk about vacations.<p>I feel like it&#x27;s a lot of sitting in planes and cars, walking, and eating and drinking.  That&#x27;s fun for <i>part</i> of the day, but I don&#x27;t want to do it all day for a week or more?  It just sounds boring.  I would rather be engaged somehow.  Consumption is not engagement IMO.  Consuming should hopefully aid in production, and business is a good example of production.<p>Some people are good at making lifelong friends abroad, and I would say that is a worthy pursuit.  But most people are not,  (In any case I feel like the dynamics of this kind of friendship have changed a lot with the Internet -- its value has been reduced for better or worse.)<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m just saying what I am trying to get out of things.  It&#x27;s just one way of looking at things, but people seem to appreciate the idea of having some focus rather than chasing gratification.  To be clear, I don&#x27;t really consider myself a &quot;productive&quot; person, in that I spend a lot of time laying in bed too.  But if I&#x27;m going to get out of bed, IMO that energy should be well spent :)",1450054404

More formally, we had at least an agreement to work together if we met their objectives.  We blew them out (way better than they anticipated), which worked strongly in our favor.<p>Unfortunately, while you are correct it is our, and specifically my (the buck stops with me) fault, I&#x27;ve run into variations on this from very small &quot;free advice&quot; requests, through what amounted to fake RFPs, where the &#x27;customer&#x27; loved our design, and in one case specifically asked us to train our competitors and share our IP (with no compensation) to have them deliver it.<p>This POC was piggy backed atop another project that had ended, and it amounted to getting some run-time in for them, after they indicated a strong preference for us (given our recent domination of an industry benchmark at the time).

The government needs to regulate this industry to protect people from themselves and ban these mechanics.&quot; This is roughly as simple to regulate and ban as it is to ban any other type of mechanic. It is what leads to weird laws such as some of California&#x27;s casinos having weird bingo-based slot machines, or pachinko machines in Japan needing you to trade a pseudocurrency for goods.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that it is impractical, costly, probably impossible and dangerous to attempt to limit the mechanics the OP is really pissed off about in a way that does not also impinge upon the freedom of the majority in order to protect those with poor impulse control.<p>I am capable of going to a casino and walking out of there without losing my shirt. I am equally as capable of going to have a few drinks at a bar without becoming an alcoholic, or to have sex with somebody and not turn into a raging sex addict. Should my ability to go to casinos, drink, or sleep with people be regulated too, just because some people&#x27;s lives are ruined by these things?<p>You can project this argument into a thousand different things just because people like them. For example, I spend an absolute eternity on the Internet. The vast majority of my life is spent reading, writing code, or doing other coder-type things. Because of this, I have also had to eat the opportunity cost involved; I have missed out on some social gatherings, I have lost friends and also lost any and all experience I would get otherwise. It&#x27;s safe to say, by some general decree, that I&#x27;m addicted to what I do. I&#x27;d argue I&#x27;m passionate. Should my work and passions be regulated because there is an opportunity cost to me doing so? Should I not be allowed to have the Internet at all because someone else has racked up inordinate amounts of debt at World of Warcraft?<p>I don&#x27;t believe it is the fault of the mechanic that these people have poor impulse control, for some reason or another, and I also don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s fair to limit the existence of these types of games because some people are incapable of walking away from them.

For example, if we are going to launch the v2 dashboard view, users should be able to opt-in for beta access. Storing half of your user ids in a leveldb/redis array and iterating each time over it is not efficient.<p>- Changed user ids from integer to strings. We are using uuids, but everybody should be able to hash the integer user id to an efficient string randomized represantation (hmac, sha1, md5).<p>- Using a hashing function to represent user ids on a scale between 1 and 100 is not efficient. What happens if you allow 5% traffic and only users with hash > 10 are using your site ? Hashing user id to a 1..100 key always yields the same result. Users having hash key 1 will always see the new features and bugs. Not a nice thing.\nWe are going to implement a more efficient way: first time a user is checked for a feature we put him in a bucket (there are 100 buckets).

Game of War is the largest player in a sub-niche of this small niche.

Does it matter whether the person gambling understands the situation they are being steered into?<p>Is it OK for bars or clubs to offer a happy hour early in the evening to get patrons going, then turn up the heat and make it hard to find water so those patrons keep ordering more drinks and getting more and more drunk throughout the evening?<p>What about phishing attacks? If someone is ignorant of the possibilities for impersonating e-mail from someone else they know, should we turn a blind eye to those who would send such e-mails to trick someone who thinks they&#x27;re helping a friend in need into parting with their money?<p>What about confidence tricksters who do similar things on the doorstep of old people who may not be familiar with what sort of credentials a genuine representative of their water or electricity supplier would carry today?<p>Or payday loan companies, who will offer what looks like a lifeline to those who have fallen on hard times, yet charge astronomical rates of interest that can rapidly lead into a vicious and sometimes devastating cycle of debt and despair?<p>How about law firms in jurisdictions where everyone normally pays their own legal costs after a court case, who send threatening letters alleging infringements of copyright and offer to settle for just less than it&#x27;s likely to cost to go to court to challenge the allegations?<p>What about outright grooming of children or other vulnerable people for the purposes of sexual exploitation?<p>For these and many other similar reasons, I think it <i>is</i> appropriate for the state to regulate industries where one party may flagrantly take advantage of another. No-one can possibly be an expert on all areas of society, and laws exist to protect us all from those who would otherwise unfairly take advantage of those weaknesses. Of course there are sometimes grey areas, but the principle that governments should never step in to protect the vulnerable from exploitation seems a very bad one to me.<p>Also, I dispute your characterisation of the entire marketing and advertising industry as if everyone does these things.

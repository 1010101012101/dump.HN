It's stuff that you should avoid, not that will necessarily break your application on any web browser.<p>Why should you avoid it? Because, basically, if it's explicitly forbidden, or not covered by spec, you can't be sure of what will happen in all (or newer) browser implementations.

4134144,comment,4133467,4134009,2,0,mturmon,,,"Smart suggestion.  There is a grain of truth in what the article says, but it's a little confused.<p>The article is also conflating two things: the (unknown) internal state of the system, which could live in a very high-dimensional space, and the system inputs, which move the internal state around in a not-understood way, but which you at least get to choose directly.<p>The cases the article examines use an internal state of a number, inputs of +1 or -1, and the system dynamics:<p><pre><code>   state(t) = state(t-1) + input(t)
</code></pre>
(E.g., ""state"" is ""number of open files"".)  The CLT does apply in this case, but it's clear that this is a very narrow case.<p>I'm not aware of convergence results that hold in any generality here.  There are concepts from control theory of observability and controllability (where can the internal state go, and how can you read it out).  And there are the concepts from nonlinear dynamics of attractors.",1340139534

4134130,comment,4133739,4133739,7,0,ethanpoole,,,"The relationship between language and thought is unclear. To be polarising, psychologists believe that language influences thought/culture and linguists believe that thought/culture influences language. There are evidence to support both conclusions, but most of the debate in popular media focuses on examples that are severely misinterpreted. For example, if Language A does not distinguish green and blue, it does not necessarily mean that the speakers of Language A cannot distinguish them, but only that Language A does not distinguish them <i>linguistically</i>. A more concrete example: many languages, such as Chinese, lack linguistic tense (e.g. past, present, future)using instead aspectual markers (e.g. perfective, imperfective), but this does not mean that Chinese speakers cannot understand temporal relations (nor that they could not still express such notions linguistically). Similarly, Russian has separate words for light blue and dark blue, but English speakers can still express these two distinct shades despite not having two separate, distinct words. In short, one has to be extremely cautious about making such broad generalisations without fully understanding the empirical data and, ideally, linguistic theory.

Disclaimer: I live in NYC and not the valley, but I think this just makes my point stronger.<p>Ideas are a dime a dozen. Many can be great. Execution is what separates the wheat from the chaff. And most of the time, the Minimum Viable Product has become cheaper to produce and iterate, than ever. So the startup costs are minimal.<p>I would actually say the opposite. People live lives, companies create products. You will have MANY ideas in your life. Make sure to maximize your chances of succeeding in your first venture. If you do, and then you exit, you will have connections, a reputation, a track record, lots of money, and you will be able to own the crap out of your next companies and do whatever you want.<p>That probably means your first venture shouldn't be the next Google or Facebook, so that you can bear giving away equity in it to people and give them responsibilities. Investors, mentors, coders, designers, marketers, etc. People who do things better than you in their respective fields. If you are reluctant to give up equity, your first startup will be hobbled in its resources, you will have to wear many hats and wear yourself thin. Why do it?<p>Companies create products. People live lives. Enjoy yours while you are young. Create a group around you that is passionate. What was that Aesop's fable? Oh yes:<p><a href=""http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/milowinter/13.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/milowinter/13.htm</a><p>I think that the individualistic culture in the USA has produced some amazing things, but the power of groups is just beginning. The open source movement is a great example, but as people get better tools to organize themselves, groups will become more and more efficient.<p>The nice thing about groups is that they can do more. An individual is just a group with one person. If set up right, larger groups are also not as fragile, if one member leaves or decides to take a break. They have more connections, they have more resources to grow.<p>In short: you will have plenty of ideas. Don't make your first one into something that you will take responsibility for and take on the risk all by yourself. Rather than letting it consume your life, land your first success. You will always be able to own and enjoy your next ideas, and have more OPTIONS to execute them how you want.",1340139264

After some more investigation, it seemed like they were actually being disconnected completely from the Internet. Bit odd.<p>Upon more investigation, I found an acquaintance had something like 10,000 bots (spybot/rxbot) going through my server (yes, a simple /list could have sufficed...) and when I looked at the topic of his channels, and noticed they consisted primarily of commands to control to the botnet. ""startkeylogger"" sort of thing.<p>A few more pokes, I realised it was Norton Antivirus that was listening to port 6667 for any ""bad"" commands, and then disconnecting the user from the internet.

I rarely get nervous but occasionally it hits us all. I do have some notes on watching great speakers in person and learning from my own mistakes.<p>1. Do NOT ask for a 'show of hands' from the audience. Even some practiced speakers do this. They think that it engages the audience, but it is a crutch, an attempt to turn the focus away from the speaker onto the audience. It's always clumsy and delays the audience from hearing the content. Some speakers claim that they want to know more about the audience before they proceed. We all know that's not true. Are you really going to completely modify your speech, dropping that five minutes of solid material just because not enough hands were raised when you asked about it? Of course not.<p>2. Note cards are not 'bad'. I had to learn this one the hard way. If you are professional orator, you will eventually get to the point where you can pontificate the same speech verbatim without a single note. But for the rest of us, a note card of bullet-point topics can keep us on track. Just don't have a ream of pages and stare down at them, reading monotonously without looking up.<p>3. Everyone hits that middle 'death valley' at some point. It's the point of a talk where you are very aware of your own voice, and you aren't getting any perceived feedback from the audience. This is the hard slog where you have to know that while time has slowed to a crawl for you, it hasn't changed for the audience. Remember how you feel when the situation is reversed - how often have you ever seen a speaker so bad that you actually noticed it and remembered it? Not often, if ever. Boring speakers are forgotten - bad speakers are ignored - great speakers MIGHT be remembered.

There is not disputing the fact that the Windows ecosystem dwarfs anything else out there.  If I heard the numbers correctly, more Windows computers are shipped in a single year than the entire installed based of Macs.  Not a put-down, just a fact.<p>As an iOS software and hardware developer one of the things that I continue to clash with is the nearly despotic hold Apple has on, well, everything.  Developing hardware for any iOS device can be a very expensive and painful experience.  For example, you can't develop a universal serial cable.  Yes, there's a serial port on that connector but Apple will not let you use it without a decryption chip and you only get authorization to make a cable for a specific app.  To think that in 2012 you can't get unencumbered API access to a serial and a USB port is just, well, unreal.<p>Microsoft Surface is, by definition, open.  I will be able to run any and all Windows software on this device the minute it becomes available.  That, again, dwarfs the Mac/iOS ecosystem.  I will be able to run Solidworks on a tablet.  How cool is that?<p>It'll be interesting to see how consumers react to this reality.  I have a feeling that, if pricing is right, adoption will be swift.<p>Of course, we'll continue to work with and produce products for the iOS landscape, but it'd sure be very interesting to have an open option out there where you could experiment and offer things that Apple simply will not let you approach.  It's about creativity, not technology.<p>EDIT: Apple is, of course, entitled to rule their own ecosystem as they wish.  No issues there.  Their toys.  Their rules.  Not complaining.

When he was in his 20s, he was absolutely terrible at speaking in front of a room. At one point early in his career he was giving a presentation and his boss turned to the HR guy that had hired him and said 'is it too late to undo this one', purposely, loud enough for him to hear.<p>Over the course of 5 or 6 years he dramatically improved at public speaking.<p>Public speaking is a learned skill. You can practice it. Do not leave making the presentation to the last minute, finish it a week before hand and practice 40 times. Comfort comes from being prepared. Walk the room beforehand.

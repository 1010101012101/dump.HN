An app developer could reasonably have dozens of third-party SDKs in an app. Say, Flurry, Applause Analytics, Google Analytics, Maps, Facebook, Twitter and so forth. Same with various APIs.<p>I remember one developer I was talking to on Twitter last year was so fed up with third-party SDKs that he basically swore them off except for the most essential ones.

That&#x27;s both the reason for the bad data and the time lag issue. It&#x27;s just impossible to make a decent guess at the necessity of acquirable skills on a useful timescale. Even technical skills that have a fantastic outlook from todays vantage point… Our visibility is not really that far, 15-20 years at a stretch.<p>For example, it seems like a good bet that for the next 15-20 the skills that allow you to write programs for a living will still be marketable, assuming a non trivial amount of re-skilling along the way. past that, who knows. For a 20 year old, that&#x27;s one third of a career.<p>Take the skills required to be employed in the enormous and affluent financial sector. Accounting, finance, data analysis, math.<p>Can you imagine that over the next 15-20 years something happens (bitcoin?) that turns this business on its head and makes a big chunk of its employees obsolete?<p>For the opposite, can you imagine that 15-20 years from now gene-tech has created industries that demand geneticists the way programmers are now in demand?<p>Pace of change is itself a meaningful change.",1440431881

You aren&#x27;t wrong, per-say, you just list all things that have literally 0 to do with the actual problems. Its a very common political trick for an ideologue like yourself to grab a bunch of things they think are bad and argue they are the cause of all your ills. You are approaching things from a &quot;this is good for people, it must be good for the country&quot; point of view. A national economy is not a person and doesn&#x27;t function on the same economic rules as a person does.<p>The real problem in this country, frankly, is the Federal Government has been badly mismanaging economic & tax policy for 30+ years. They&#x27;ve repeatedly used short term solutions and short-changed everything from highways to R&D in the name of military, taxes, & social spending. Many long term investments in physical goods [e.g. buildings] are really only rated for a 30ish year timeline for depreciation for a reason.<p>That combined with the demographic shifts, labor market arbitrage, massive private debt load are the actual problems.

Look at the line representing private debt. It clearly is not parallel to the GDP line and, indeed, reflects a rapid growth of private debt relative to GDP.<p>> Look familiar? Time and again, that’s the story we found: A major financial crisis is preceded by a runup in private debt relative to GDP. In fact, there seems to be only one other ingredient required for a crisis: that the absolute level of private debt is high to begin with. We found that almost all instances of rapid debt growth coupled with high overall levels of private debt have led to crises.",1440431858

The cost to the economy both in terms of government spending and workforce depletion as national guard troops were mobilized for duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.<p>American worker productivity has remained high, which has kept real wage growth low, as employers leverage they &quot;be thankful you even have a job&quot; meme over the heads of employees who perhaps just scraped by in the great recession or spent months or even years unemployed.<p>America&#x27;s largest trading partner, China, is running a partially managed economy with a fiat currency that is priced more on government policy than market realities. That pricing has lead to some unsustainable conditions in the Chinese economy which are being &quot;addressed&quot; by some pretty big moves (currency devaluation is not something you do lightly in the worlds second largest economy).<p>So the interesting question is how does the world see it? And how will it play out? Everyone has their bets, but and you can read about some of them in Barron&#x27;s or the Economist or the WSJ.<p>The current disaster is Chinese. By devaluing their currency they are effectively &quot;taking value&quot; from people who were trading with them relative to the partner&#x27;s home currency. So lets say someone like Apple contracts to buy 10 million iPhone 6 baseboards, in Rmb at an exchange rate of $100 per board, and now when it comes time to actually take delivery and buy the boards they cost Apple the equivalent of $150 each. Apple needs to pony up an additional half billion dollars for their phones. This then will hit their bottom line in terms of revenue, which means their stock price will go down (they won&#x27;t be as profitable a company) and so funds holding Apple will lose their value in proportion to their Apple stock. And China has done this by devaluing its currency.<p>It doesn&#x27;t change how strong Apple&#x27;s market presence is, or that they can sell a phone for a ton of money, but it changes the cost/value equation faster than Apple can respond and so there is a disruption in their earnings. That will ripple across a lot of companies.<p>But is that a &#x27;health&#x27; issue for the American economy? Not really. Rather it puts pressure to restructure the costs of the economy into a different place. People still buy iPhones and will for the forseeable future. So the economy is still strong, but if the price of those iPhones doubles their volume will likely fall and so Apple&#x27;s earnings might be &#x27;weak&#x27;.<p>The stock market is responding to the adjustments in China, internalizing the lack of fiscal oversight in that economy, and pricing it into the value of companies that do a lot of business there. I expect a hell of a correction and some interesting new markets opening up (like India, Vietnam or Thailand if the Thai can get their governance under control) as the cost of doing business in China begins to more accurately reflect the real costs of doing business there.<p>EDIT: As folks have pointed out the currency hit is reversed, Apple would get its parts for less if they priced them in RMB vs Dollars. Any RMB they were holding in their cash pile would have lost value, so to the extent that their sales in China have not been moved into Euros (we know they aren&#x27;t repatriated into Dollars for tax reasons) are going to buy less than they did before.",1440431388

(1) people are adequately warned before-hand that there&#x27;s a camera. (a warning sign will do, but a tiny sticker wouldn&#x27;t, hidden cameras thereby can&#x27;t be legal in any case) or (2) the camera doesn&#x27;t film actual people. (e.g. bird watching, a live internet cam that watches the traffic or weather, or a busy square where the camera is zoomed out so much that individual people aren&#x27;t recognisable).<p>Security cameras in public areas fall under similar conditions, but of course most of them are on private property where there are different rules. However, a shop is also public domain, despite being private territory, because shop owners open their doors to the public. So here, too, cameras surveillance must be communicated, too. (which can be the camera being very openly visible, a monitor showing camera footage indicating there&#x27;s surveillance, signs, or e.g. a warning on the ticket of say a concert).<p>In short, what he did wouldn&#x27;t have been allowed as it appears like he built this camera, &#x27;hid&#x27; it (or didn&#x27;t position it so it&#x27;s easily visible to all), and didn&#x27;t inform those being taped that they were being taped.

Another list of clauses are null when they are not unreasonably limiting. So any contract within Dutch jurisdiction is limited in that way.<p>A contract with X.com would not hit Dutch jurisdiction directly, although with a Dutch website / translation and perhaps a Dutch office you easily come into reach.<p>Examples: You cannot be held to TOS that are not willfully handed to you. (So no tiny signs in stores, or hidden on websites. Exact translation obviously ambiguous.) Changes in pricing, especially early in the contract, usually give the right to cancel the contract. Should be able to cancel contracts anyways. Should deliver timely, and cannot contract &#x27;untimely delivery&#x27;.<p>Still, daresay that contract law on the internet in the Netherlands is not a big field of litigation. For one thing, our damages are usually only &#x27;true (financial) damages&#x27;. So in the context of (nearly) free products, you hardly get any litigation. Class action is limited, too.<p>Example here: consider a webshop that cancels your order after a discount gets too popular. You could probably demand fullfillment, since they could easily deliver from other retailers at a loss. But considering the costs of litigation are many times the difference in price, most people resign upon ordering elsewhere.

However, I don&#x27;t think food nutrition is obvious to a significant portion of the population.  Proof of this is how the food industry advertises and labels their products to take advantage of buyers&#x27; ignorance:<p>-- orange juice with labels saying that it&#x27;s &quot;fortified with extra vitamins and calcium&quot;.  (Many people will associate oj with positive connotations of &quot;fruit&quot;, and the vitamin supplement is a bonus.  Result:  unsophisticated buyers think of oj as &quot;healthy&quot; when it&#x27;s really concentrated sugar water that will contribute to obesity and tooth decay.)<p>-- lean cuisine &quot;low-fat&quot; microwave dinners with a &quot;heart healthy&quot; icon on the box.  (Naive buyers see the &quot;low fat&quot; as a signal for &quot;healthy&quot; but don&#x27;t realize that manufacturers have to amplify the taste by adding lots of salt.  The heavy carbs in those meals are also controversial.)<p>-- granola bars and &quot;energy&quot; bars.  (The packaging has pictures of active hikers, bicycle riders, mountain climbers, etc.  Some granola bars even prominently feature &quot;fiber&quot; as a benefit.  The ignorant don&#x27;t realize that these snacks are really glorified &quot;candy bars&quot; with clever marketing to lessen the guilt trip of eating a stick of sugar.)<p>-- fat free yogurt.  (They took out the fat but now the yogurt has lots of sugar, which is another form of calories, which most people won&#x27;t burn off, which then gets stored as fat anyway.)<p>-- photographs of celebrities with milk mustaches shown on billboards and magazine ads and associated slogans like &quot;<i>milk does a body good!</i>&quot;.  (Those ads are promoted by the dairy industry and it&#x27;s questionable whether it&#x27;s healthy for adults to drink milk.)<p>-- USDA food pyramid.  (The uneducated don&#x27;t realize that the USDA (and hence the chart) is influenced and manipulated by the meat & dairy industries.  Because the nutrition advice is officially published by the government and plastered all over school walls, it feels authoritative.  Naive consumers don&#x27;t realize that if the food pyramid was designed by nutritionists not financially linked to meat & dairy, they would place vegetables as highest priority.)<p>For the consumers that get exposed to nutrition information in a passive way, they really <i>don&#x27;t know the difference between healthy and unhealthy foods.</i>    There&#x27;s so much misinformation and manipulation that the American consumer is less knowledgeable about what&#x27;s healthy than the African bushmen eating wild berries and hunting antelope.",1440428665
10110304,comment,10107937,10108710,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Crash-only is rather different from power cycling. The unit of granularity in a crash-only metaphor is at a higher level (process, thread, green thread or other schedulable entity), the whole point being that you delegate to a supervisor tree for restarting crashed subtasks/processes to a known good state while maintaining the uptime and integrity of the entire system (i.e. crashes are not typically user-visible). It works really well because in any complex system running on top of so many layers, the state space expands combinatorially so that performing intricate error diagnosis and recovery procedures will often be a losing proposition from the number of code paths you&#x27;d need to properly exercise.<p>Power cycling is different. A system that expects you to power cycle often because it consistently fragments or cannot dynamically update/reread its configuration is broken and a major annoyance. In many ways, systems that require lots of power cycling are as such because they&#x27;re designed in a way antithetical to crash-only.

They cheat because of many factors, but according to surveys, they cheat more often out of a need for physical satisfaction, while women cheat more out of a need for emotional or intimate satisfaction.<p>As far as need for online services to help? That&#x27;s completely dependent on the person, again. True, women get hit on more often & indiscriminately, so they&#x27;d have more choice.

7793885,comment,7790065,7793452,2,0,aaronem,,,"> step into the state of a man&#x27;s spiritual condition and all bets are off<p>The religion best represented on HN, and that to which hew most commenters here, includes among its basic doctrines the tenet that all spiritual beliefs are equally invalid, and therefore equally meaningless, save only that religion&#x27;s own such beliefs, which are believed to be empirical rather than spiritual. This makes it trivial for believers to produce public displays of simultaneous tolerance (&quot;whatever works for you&quot;) and superiority (&quot;but you can&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s The Answer because there is no one answer&quot;), something which they find both personally satisfying and socially beneficial.<p>Of course, their beliefs are no more empirically demonstrable than those of any other religion, nor are they derived from pure reason as their adherents prefer to believe. For example, believers in this faith universally misunderstand the nature of religion, so as to imagine that no system of beliefs can be called religious save that it involve at least one deity; indeed, this misunderstanding constitutes a crucial slab in the foundation of their dogma, for on it rests the belief that they are virtuous skeptics who can&#x27;t be fooled by mere religious faith, and are thus apart from and above (all other sorts of) believers:<p>> Some people [like my own worthy self] just aren&#x27;t wired to be religious<p>Which leads us to a popular explanation, among atheists, for the vexatious popularity of other religions: that the human nervous system is so wired as to produce religious experience entirely by accident, and thus meaninglessly. [1]<p>Well, everyone <i>else&#x27;s</i> nervous system, anyway; they themselves &quot;aren&#x27;t wired to be religious&quot;, obviously, because if they were, they&#x27;d have a religion, and atheism isn&#x27;t a religion -- it can&#x27;t be! It has no deity! -- so atheists aren&#x27;t religious, so they must be &quot;[not] wired to be religious&quot;, which must mean they&#x27;re necessarily smarter and/or &quot;more evolved&quot; [2].<p>The former belief is hardly limited to atheists, of course, and is merely smug and pretentious. The latter, though, rests in a fundamental misunderstanding of the workings of evolution, and is thus utterly senseless; it is every bit as much a matter of faith as, for example, the idea of divine providence.<p>(How marvelous it is that these fellows presume to offer counsel on the subject of <i>humility!</i>)<p>The truth of the matter, of course, is that, if any of us are &quot;wired to be religious&quot;, then all of us are. (All of us are.) The only remaining question, which applies equally well to all the many other filters inherent in our perceptual mechanisms, is whether we recognize it as such and attempt to account for its effect, or instead fail so to do and believe its input to be a reliable representation of reality.<p>That latter category is shared by theists and atheists alike -- each believing, however he represent himself in public, that he has found The Answer, and that those in the other camp must just not really understand the world, because if they did, they wouldn&#x27;t <i>be</i> in the other camp.<p>The former category is sparsely populated by comparison, and, would-be bodhisattvas excepted, most of us in it tend to keep our mouths pretty well shut on the subject; neither a theist nor an atheist is often well equipped to comprehend an <i>areligious</i> perspective on anything, and to detail one thus rarely has any effect save to start a pointless gunfight. (Besides, being a member of neither camp makes it very easy to get along with those in both, and why not do so?)<p>I break my habit of silence on this occasion not because I have any hope of unusually productive discussion on the matter, but instead simply in order to place myself outside the argument which will probably ensue from my observation that I&#x27;m favorably impressed, sir, by your bravery and courage in contravening publicly the popular faith, and by the altruistic impulse which motivated you to do so. Irrespective of the reception you encounter in doing so, the act itself speaks well of your honorable character, and that&#x27;s something I&#x27;m always glad to see.<p>[1] An apparently popular work of atheology on the matter: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_Explained"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_Explained</a><p>[2] Think I&#x27;m kidding? <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/03/100303-liberals-atheists-smarter-evolution-evolved/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/03/100303-liber...</a>",1400953761

But that&#x27;s my biased view where finding a way to implement something is perceived as creative. For non-programmers, I&#x27;m implementing something boring in  fundamentally the only possible and utterly boring way: the program will get some boring input and produce even more boring output.

A quote from Richard Feynman himself, describing events in 1940-ties:<p>&quot;Well, Mr. Frankel, who started this program, began to suffer from the computer disease that anybody who works with computers now knows about. It&#x27;s a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is you <i>play</i> with them. They are so wonderful. You have these switches - if it&#x27;s an even number you do this, if it&#x27;s an odd number you do that - and pretty soon you can do more and more elaborate things if you are clever enough, on one machine.<p>After a while the whole system broke down. Frankel wasn&#x27;t paying any attention; he wasn&#x27;t supervising anybody. The system was going very, very slowly - while he was sitting in a room figuring out how to make one tabulator automatically print arc-tangent X, and then it would start and it would print columns and then bitsi, bitsi, bitsi, and calculate the arc-tangent automatically by integrating as it went along and make a whole table in one operation.<p>Absolutely useless. We <i>had</i> tables of arc-tangents. But if you&#x27;ve ever worked with computers, you understand the disease - the <i>delight</i> in being able to see how much you can do. But he got the disease for the first time, the poor fellow who invented the thing.&quot;<p><a href=""http://benjaminjcousins.wordpress.com/2014/04/01/richard-feynmans-computer-disease/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benjaminjcousins.wordpress.com/2014/04/01/richard-fey...</a><p>(Of course, finding a best way to calculate arc-tangent on a given platform is a serious task.

That, it can be said, is an engineering problem, not a problem for a &quot;developer.&quot; But still, we&#x27;re just moving towards the &quot;only&quot; effective and correct way.

As you say, it has some issues.<p>Also, while the page I linked to was the first time I saw anyone offer a convenient name and write-up to cite, I should acknowledge that there had been discussions about using tab widths that varied by context long before that page was written. Many editors have provided related functionality where hitting tab once would automatically align your code blocks, function parameters, etc.<p>I suspect that for anything closer to the specific elastic tabstops idea I cited to become established, we&#x27;d need a distinct character rather than reusing ASCII spaces and tabs. This could work rather like the way various typesetting systems and DTP packages have &quot;align to here&quot; markers that don&#x27;t necessarily introduce any extra horizontal space themselves but do indicate that consistency should be enforced across related lines.<p>I personally think that a standardised character like that and support for it in tools like editors and diff displays could bring several modest benefits: aside from the immediate convenience of aligning code more neatly if that&#x27;s helpful, it could actually clean up a lot of whitespace-based diffs that tend to confuse tools today without necessarily having to ignore all whitespace, and of course it would improve the usefulness of proportional fonts when reading code, which I think is where we came in.",1400952336

How do we measure fluency in &quot;coding&quot;?<p>Think about it. A crash course on basic procedural constructs like loops, variables, functions and maybe some simple exercises where one makes use of a language&#x27;s standard library is not particularly useful. Even the conceptual knowledge that one gains is relatively minimal.<p>It&#x27;s not like the huge percentages of people &quot;knowing how to code&quot; will do anything meaningful with it. Why? Because they wouldn&#x27;t have the skill.<p>Many discussions revolving around compulsory code education seem to completely ignore the tons of domain-specific knowledge one requires to put coding skills to any real use. It&#x27;s likely that little of the &quot;code literates&quot; will ever contribute to an open source project, for instance.<p>This is because besides code, you have (potentially): a build system, continuous integration, documentation generator, actual protocols that must be understood (HTTP, DNS, FTP, etc.), use of OS-specific system calls and constructs, general knowledge of memory layout, knowledge of system administration, etc.<p>These are merely condensed into a nutshell. Code by itself is of little use without actually knowing how computers work in general, which is no small task to comprehend, and requires tons of domain-specific knowledge as to the many abstractions we have created around software and hardware. It&#x27;s a perpetual learning experience. A person who has learned rudimentary C is of little use in any serious project that requires knowledge of the POSIX and/or glibc API, for instance.<p>It&#x27;s a completely meaningless metric in general. Most people will just do some basic imperative coding in a highly abstracted knowledge with no real conceptual understanding of what actually goes on, and promptly forget about it. Maybe they&#x27;ll remember how to write a recursive Fibonacci sequence procedure.<p>Software is more than code. It is complex and multi-faceted. I can see blind coding having some uses for things like VBA macros, but those can be picked up by individuals on a case-by-case basis, when and if they need them.",1400951353

4653827,comment,4653653,4653799,4,0,chimeracoder,,,">  the same sort of questionnaire that you'd find on the Internet.<p>Unfortunately the methods vary, and not all professionals care to (or even are trained to) conduct the more elaborate diagnoses. However, for differential diagnoses (ie, the most difficult to make - 'is this really ADHD, or just the way that Joe's depression/OCD/etc. happens to manifest?), there are some more elaborate diagnostic methods. I can't comment firsthand, but I know these tests can span multiple media (in-person interviews, written self-evaluations, third-party reports, IQ tests, fine motor skills tests, achievement tests, etc.). I had a friend who went through a battery of these tests before her final diagnosis.<p>Very few people actually bother, because it's very expensive (and often not covered by insurance). The only reason you would go through this is if you want to be <i>really</i> sure that you have ADHD, or if you're trying to identify whether cognitive treatment (ie, therapy) is appropriate or whether a hidden neurological condition, etc. is actually the problem.<p>However, even for a professional, it's almost impossible to make an accurate self-diagnosis (or even a diagnosis of one's own children, for example). It's just too easy to fall into the trap of confirmation bias - or worse, ignore signs that may be visible to others, even if obscured.<p>I do agree that it's unfortunate that not all professionals are properly equipped to make these diagnoses - this is <i>especially</i> the case for children - because it leads to an overdiagnosis among healthy children, while those with less obvious (but still debilitating) symptoms slip through the cracks without ever realizing they have a problem, since they are able to 'make do'.<p>> (Though perhaps the tester was also observing my behavior, and the like.)<p>I am almost certain that this was the case as well (at least to an extent)!",1350276815

The point is not to frame the discussion so you can ""win"".<p>Whether you want to admit it, there <i>are</i> things you can never know. That's incontrovertible. You have two choices: you can throw your hands in the air and say ""oh well I'll never know"" or you can start to learn how to sense when other people have a depth of knowledge or experience that is unavailable to you, and use their knowledge to help you act in the world.<p>Many very bright people are constitutionally incapable of working this way. Unless they can reduce a concept down to first principles that are grounded in their personal experience, the concept is wrong to them.<p>To me, that's a huge epistemological limitation, and I think it will hamper your ability to grow intellectually. I have found that with certain things I had to <i>first</i> accept them and live with them, after someone I trust and respect, with different experience than I have, suggested they were true. Only later, after living with and applying the ideas, was I able to rationalize them.<p>This realization is the greatest gift Feminist theory has given me, as a thinker.",1350276663

They did in fact avoid a war.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement</a><p>But since the agreement was made possible by the fear of the potential alternative outcome (failed negotiations -> risk war), which was of different significance to the opponents (one could say, with hindsight, that one of the negotiating parties <i>wanted</i> an opportunity to go to war), an advantage could be gained by the party with attached less significance to the bad outcome.<p>The result was in fact positive for all the negotiators : they all got what they wanted. But the ones with an interest in a war were given the zone where the border defenses and the banks were - even if the result was positive for all, some gained more - and not just ""more"", but strategically more.<p>In other words, reaching an agreement failed to consider the strategic significance of the advantage that was given away.<p>Slippery slope?

Brought my 2009 MBP in because the screen was starting to have some issues.  As part of the documentation, the rep asked me to input my username and password to their report form.  Not thinking, I did so, assuming my password would be hidden.  It was not - it was right there in plain text.  Not to worry!  It doesn't get printed out.  It only gets stored in case the repair facility needs it to access my computer.  It was at this point I woke up and had a WTF moment.

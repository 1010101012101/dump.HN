In and of itself, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad idea.  However the $180,000 registration fee seems a bit like a money grab, the lack of restrictions on the allowed names (e.g. .sucks) and the land-grabbing by large companies on a wide range of generic names (mainly from what I&#x27;ve seen Google and Amazon) have made the process a bit of a mess.",1428739182

There&#x27;s a very good reason that Bitcoin Script should be simplistic, why the hell would you want to be doing any sort of detailed computation at that level? With n nodes on the network you amplify the load n times, why not do it on an oracle where it&#x27;s practically free? There&#x27;s already comments by the Ethereum developers that it will be incredibly hard for a client to ever bootstrap from genesis once they launch, just due to the insane amount of script execution time.<p>If you&#x27;re taking input from an oracle (you almost always are), you have the same level of trust in it anyway, you just moved computation into the stupidly expensive and massively redundant portion of the system.

9358823,comment,9354650,9354650,0,0,stinos,,,"Some of the functionality is builtin into VS - not always exactly the same, but sometimes close enough. So if you&#x27;re afraid it will crush VS performance (the proper way would be to try it of course) check these. Just metioning this because not everybody knows these and when VS2013 came out I decided to try it with a minimum of extensions and see it it&#x27;s doable. For C#, I&#x27;m too spoiled by Resharper so it&#x27;s unbearable. For C++ however I really like it: super snappy IDE with just enough builtin navigation etc functionality. Startup time alone for the VS2013 install is 5 to 10 times faster than the VS2012 one (Resharper and Visual Assist X).
So:<p>- <i>go to everything</i> (except folders): Edit.NavigateTo and don&#x27;t forget to turn on the Show Details checkbox<p>- <i>go to file or folder</i>: Window.SolutionExplorerSearch<p>- <i>switch between header and source files</i>: EditorContextMenus.CodeWindow.ToggleHeaderCodeFile<p>- <i>find usage</i> and the likes: Edit.FindAllReferences or EditorContextMenus.CodeWindow.ViewCallHierarchy - doesn&#x27;t always work properly though and can be slow<p>- <i>go to file member</i>: built-in dropdown at top of file, not sure if there is a keyboard shortcut for it though<p>- <i>live static_assert evaluation</i>: built-in<p>- <i>rename</i> and the likes: I once forced myself to learn at least some of the regular expression syntax and combined with builtin Find/Replace it served me pretty well for this<p>In general I&#x27;d advise people to check all VS has to offer (list it via command window or in keyboard customisation): if you haven&#x27;t ever done so I bet you&#x27;ll find commands you&#x27;ll come to like and use but never heard of before.

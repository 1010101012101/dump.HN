It's bordered on the south side by I-280.

So small developers usually settle before going to court even on bogus patents.<p>Is it a different when applied to patents than to copyright? So on which cases are the defendant actually awarded its costs? Which ones are not? What's the difference? Is this case in the article maybe an exemplary case that might change how judges award defendants with its costs? Could this help set patent trolls back from suing small developers?",1331690174

My company, along with 15 others in our group, radically changed their idea to the point where it didn't matter what idea we came through the door with. We started out with a Facebook app for sports stuff and ended up as a successful video advertising business. Absolutely zero correlation. PG bet on us in the beginning, not because he loved our idea (it actually was a pretty bad idea), but he saw that my co-founder and I gelled and that we were determined to make whatever damn thing we touched into some form of success.<p>The other thing to think about is that everyone, i mean everyone has some idea they have thought about which could be a business. If you're the 1% that have never thought of something that could use a change in this world, then the no-idea application probably doesn't apply to you. For the other 99, you can come in with a handful of things that bother you in the world which could be solved by software and YC will more than likely help you pick something they know has a pretty good shot if you are willing to put in the hours.",1331690135

There is still a major social component to trade that is too often ignored by economists, and people will sometimes pay even when they don't have to.<p>I think the case of podcasts is illustrative here. Despite a lack of DRM, a convention of free-as-in-beer, and a zero lawsuits (that I know of), the field has been thriving for 10 years using incentive structures which do not require IP:<p>- Pure Promotion, such as comedians who put out a free podcast to attract fans for live performances.<p>- Up-sells, whether for additional premium content, apps, t-shirts, etc.<p>- Donations, which at minimum can defray overhead costs. (It's worth noting that Kickstarter is fairly indistinguishable from a donation/gift economy, assuming the reward isn't a simple pre-order.)<p>- Advertising, while a dirty business model for producer and consumer alike, still can pay the bills, especially if ad content is tasteful and targeted.<p>Now, these methods are by no means the only ones possible, and that's my point. Rather than to try to create scarcity out of abundance, I think we're better off embracing it, and finding new, indirect ways to profit. To re-use PG's analogy, rather than suing the smell-stealer, the restauranteur could invite people to enjoy some free smells, knowing that some would be enticed to pay for a meal.

3701276,comment,3698118,3698118,1,0,kragen,,,"The thing I'm puzzled about here is why saving silicon makes your solar cells cheaper.  I mean, silicon is really cheap, right?  Metallurgical-grade silicon is 77 cents a pound: <a href=""http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silicon/silicmcs06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silicon/sil...</a>  and that works out to around a penny a watt.<p>I tried to dig into this a few years ago.  Evergreen Solar's 10-K for 2007 <a href=""http://edgar.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/947397/000095013508001256/b68105ese10vk.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edgar.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/947397/000095013508...</a> has some information.  Evergreen's competitive advantage is supposedly that they use less silicon than other manufacturers because they don't saw their wafers  they grow them.  They say they use about 5g of silicon per watt (in 2007, planning to reduce it to 2g per watt by 2012), and it sounds like they get paid about US$3.87 per watt on average (US$58M revenue in 2007, maxed-out manufacturing capacity of 15MW/year, 276 full-time employees in manufacturing).  Their ""cost of revenue"" (i.e. manufacturing cost) was US$53M, or US$3.53/W.  But 5g of metallurgical-grade silicon at the price above is US$0.008.  If each employee costs US$120k per year (including health benefits, and remembering that a bunch of them are Ph.D.s) then that would be US$2.20/W in labor costs, which already accounts for the majority of that cost of revenue.<p>But they're not buying metallurgical-grade silicon; they're buying ""polysilicon"", short for ""polycrystalline silicon"", which is perhaps a bit of a misnomer, since how many crystals are in each piece of silicon supplied by their suppliers is somewhat immaterial, since Evergreen melts the silicon down and crystallizes it in polycrystalline silicon ribbons in their ""String Ribbon"" furnaces.  Maybe that costs a lot more than metallurgical-grade silicon?<p>It used to be hard to find that information!  But it's much better now; <a href=""http://pvinsights.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pvinsights.com/</a> lists current PV-grade polysilicon prices at US$29 to US$35 per kilogram, and  <a href=""http://www.pv-tech.org/news/polysilicon_prices_declines_will_continue_sector_shakeout_says_gtm_research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pv-tech.org/news/polysilicon_prices_declines_will...</a> explains that this is a major drop from previous prices of US$80/kg.  5 g at US$35 per kilogram is US$0.175.  But ""Silicon PV Module Price Per Watt"" ranges from US$0.75 to US$1.40.  Dropping 17 off that price still isn't going to get you to 40.  And if Evergreen has really made it to 2g/W, silicon cost is even less of the total cost.<p><a href=""http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/008483.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/008483.html</a> mentions that in 2008 polysilicon prices peaked at US$400/kg.<p>Anyway.

Imagine assembling a ""A"" team of scholars and scientists, getting them to make substantial, substantive contributions in each of their respective areas of expertise, and publishing the results under the guidance of a top editorial board. The results echoed in the western world at the highest levels for no less than two centuries, culminating in a famous 1911 edition that was widely regarded as the pinnacle in assembled human knowledge to that time - something to be marveled at. For years, collectors paid a great premium to buy the 1911 edition, just for that reason. Even in the period leading up to the 1960s, the EB was a staple in most every western home where parents valued education and academic achievement for their kids. Whole hordes of door-to-door salesmen supported their families very comfortably just by selling this particular product.<p>So, yes, the EB became kind of laughable with its clumsy marketing efforts and awkward efforts to adapt to modern technology in the past couple of decades, but be kind to its memory. It was one of the great attempts in all history to try to do what many dream of doing today through the internet and the advantages of the digital age: limited by the resources of that day, for sure, but an amazing achievement nonetheless. There is something special that has died here and, if only for old time's sake, we can mourn its passing.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3700881"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3700881</a>",1331687401

59103,comment,58825,58929,0,0,michaelneale,,,"I would second that. At the risk of hyperbole, the ""mini-lisp revolution"" could be one of the more important things to happen to the state of the art. Lisps just have so much going for them, but common lisp can not be the answer. No idea about arc, but at least there is some potential for leadership to be shown. 
People need to just start using stuff for ""hobby"" projects. 
Its possible that lisp could become very popular, due to ""language oriented programming"" - which is just a silly name to attract people (notice how ""DSLs"" are now so popular, well lisp is nothing if not a platform for creating a DSL which solves your problem for you). heh, its not anything knew, I think words to that effect are mentioned in the SICP notes.",1190671139

59101,comment,58025,58025,0,0,ww,,,"The main purpose of philosophy is to find truth without exceptions.
There are people, like descarte, that spend their lives trying to find something that is true, and then measure everything else within that truth<p>Metaphysics: What is true, without exceptions, about things that are not physical or on the boundary of being physical.
Ontology: What is true, without exceptions, about existence (being)
Epistemology: What is true, without exceptions, about how you know what you know
Ethics: What is true about the way things ought to be, without exceptions.<p>Epistemology/Ontology/Metaphysics have provided lots of value for those that love truth without exceptions.<p>If you read philosophers and try to see the problems they want to solve within those branches of philosophy, ask yourself what are the exceptions.  When you try to battle with them, you will have the feeling of thinking you are the first one to climb a large mountain, only to find a whole city at the top with a lot of people saying, 'What took you so long to get here? PS here are the <i>real</i> mountains for you to climb!'  <p>Is there anything that is true (epistemology)?  If false, why have an essay?  If true, what is it?<p>A simple start, can a self refuting statement be true?  Well the vast majority of philosophers would tell you no.  That is to say they would believe the following statement to be true:<p>1) Self refuting statements are false or inscrutable.<p>So you have plenty of people in the world that deny (1).  Philosophy allows the Descarte types to relax when dealing with these people.<p>So lets take a Descarte truth based on (1).  That would be:<p>2) I cannot doubt doubting.<p>Or in other words I do not have the ability to doubt my ability to doubt.
Then when someone says something like this:<p>4) If I am multiple pieces, I do not exist (?!)
5) Empirical data has shown that I am multiple pieces (cells)
6) Therefore I do not exist<p>a descarte type doesn't waste brain energy on either (4) or (5) (or both).<p>To sum this up, philosophy is the domain of what is <i>necessarily</i> the case.  Science (positivism) has nothing to say about this.  That is what philosophy brings to the table.  But only a descarte type would enjoy this.<p>For programmers, an analogy could be said as lisp programmers laugh at the 'pattern circus' and the 'aspect oriented design' of other languages (which basically fix what should not have been broken in the first place), philosophers laught 10X as much at people that say things like 'I don't exist' and 'there are no true statements' and wish that they could help them, but know that some people love their circus so they let them have their fun.<p><p>",1190671057

59068,comment,58915,58955,0,0,Shooter,,,"[for sufficiently vague definitions of ""idea""]<p>Upmodded.  That is brilliant.<p>As an entrepreneur, I have very specific thoughts on what constitutes a ""good idea for a business.""  To me, it suggests that you have four things:<p>1. a keen insight into what a group of people (with money) want <p>2. you have a means of delivering a solution to those needy people <p>3. you have a way of targeting those needy people to let them know about your solution <p>4. you can deliver your solution at a profit.  <p>When I started investing in startups, I learned that my definition of a good idea for a business differs GREATLY from what many are willing to pitch to me as a good idea.
Many people are willing to pitch a very nebulous 'idea.'<p>
There are also certain ideas prevalent in the startup community now that are MOSTLY or SOMETIMES true, but that I think people take too literally or misunderstand.<p>""Ideas are worthless, execution is paramount.""  Look, if you have a truly great idea...execution becomes much less important.  With a great idea (which implies an actual business model), you can make quite a few execution mistakes and still end up with a great business.  If you stumble, investors are more forgiving and will usually find the help you need in the execution area.  <p>""Your final business is almost always different than what you initially intended to do"" is another startup cliche that I think some entrepreneurs sometimes take too literally.  This pearl of wisdom is basically telling you that you need to be flexible.  Being flexible is very different that attacking an industry because it is hot and hoping something shakes out.<p>""Get the users and figure out a profit model later.  It is easy to monetize millions of eyeballs.""  Again, this may be mostly true for a certain class of business...but it can also be a ticket to FAIL.   <p>With apologies to Mrs. Robinson, I'm actually getting pitches like this:<p>Entrepreneur:  ""I have a GREAT idea!""<p>Me: ""Yes?""<p>Entrepreneur: ""Plastics!!!""<p>Me: ""What do you mean 'plastics'?""<p>Entrepreneur:  ""They're gonna be huge.  Plastics are the future.""<p>Me: ""What is your actual idea?  How are you going to make money?""<p>Entrepreneur:  ""Advertising?""<p>",1190668094

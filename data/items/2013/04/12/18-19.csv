That said, this issue (Taliban extortion) was covered on the major news channels as well. But the questions that were raised were two fold. One, how did people validate that their bribes were actually paying for protection, and the relative cost of bribes versus the relative cost of private security (aka Blackwater) to protect the supply convoys.<p>I don't think anyone in the stories had credible reasoning (they were pushing the ""Taliban Toll Roads"" meme pretty hard). Now I can believe that actually getting a handle on what was or was not going on here, given the situation with both Pakistan and Afghanistan is difficult if not impossible. And I can certainly believe that percentages of these contracts are going to shady people. But what wasn't clear was how much of this was simple theft and how much was part of the ""war effort.""",1365793057

Let me try to address them for you.<p>inDinero shook up our whole business model at the beginning of 2012, pivoting from a self-service model to a full-service model.  As a result, weve been dedicating the vast majority of our resources to our full-service clients.<p>This has impacted response times for our self-service clients, but we see that as a necessary compromise in the growth of our company.  Im glad you decided to upgrade to our full-service package!<p>It looks like we could have done a better job on our calls with you today in describing our payroll offerings.  Yes, its absolutely true that we use Intuit as the backbone of our payroll service.  We think at this stage of inDineros growth that we need to invest our resources in developing our web-based dashboard and providing the suite of bookkeeping and tax services that our clients require.   Using Intuit as a payroll backbone allows us to keep our focus where it needs to be.<p>While many of our payroll clients have their pay days on the 1st and 16th of the month, we can support any pay dates and periods you would like to use.  Im sorry if this was not made clear.<p>We do use Google Docs with some clients to share information because many of our clients find that a convenient medium, but we do not use it for sensitive information exchange.  Generally we use it only for the reporting of hours for hourly employees and reimbursement amounts.<p>I hope Ive addressed your concerns, and your Finance Team at inDinero is still very eager to work with you and show you how we can make your life easier.  We look forward to proving that to you.",1365792160

We were looking for a SFH, she kept pushing us to condos. We had a budget of X, she kept pushing to to X+10%. We'd make an offer N on something, she'd pressure us to offer N+20% (we didn't win any bids, but looking back at the sold records it was never on price).<p>She wasn't always forthcoming about helping us analyze the property. Until we flat-out said ""this one's not for us"", she wouldn't ever point out something wrong with the house unless it was glaringly obvious (one home that reeked of dog piss, for example). She obviously had experience in checking out houses, because as soon as we'd write a place off she'd rattle off 12 things that she saw wrong with it (dry rot, obviously unpermitted construction, etc).<p>It just felt lazy to me how she used cash as a crutch. Rather than getting creative with offers & cover letters and actually, you know, <i>selling</i> us, she'd say ""let's throw more money at it!"". She even had the gall to tell me that cash offers are usually higher than asking. Not even kidding.<p>It frustrates me to no end, because I'm the type that's on the phone with my mortgage broker every day asking what I can do to push the deal through. If you accept my offer, I won't sleep until I've done every single thing I can do to make it happen. I once got a short sale done (funded!) in 30 days (!!). You want me to buy your house.<p>But sellers can really be dumb, too. This one house I put an offer in, the sellers accepted a ""higher cash offer"" that fell out of escrow in a month. I re-offered, 20% down, no contingencies. Not even an inspection. They went with an offer that was $5k above mine, and then it took 90 days to close. Oh, and the house was vacant. Really guys, was that $5k minus commission worth carrying your house another 1 month + 2 months?<p>Anyway, I got so sick of it all I just rented.

5540183,comment,5538194,5538786,2,0,eeperson,,,"I feel like a lot of these points are more about just having tests rather than writing tests first.  Also, I think some of these points only make sense if you already have a pretty good idea of what you are going to write.  More specifically:<p>1. This may be the case but I don't think this requires that you write your tests up front just that you don't leave all of your testing until the very end<p>2. This is just about having tests<p>3. I don't really see why writing your tests up front would make them more complete unless you already know exactly what you want to build.  I find that I often come up with most of my edge cases while I am writing the code.<p>4. In many cases, if you tests before you still don't know if your tests pass because of your code is good or because the test is bad.  Many tests, up front, fail for very obvious reasons (such as the function you are testing simply doesn't exist yet).  Just because they fail in the beginning doesn't mean they are good tests.  What you actually want is mutation testing [1].  Testing up front is just a really crude version of this.  I usually do mutation testing manually  by removing the code I am trying to test, at the end, to ensure that my test fails if it is not there.<p>5. Again, just about having tests<p>Ultimately I think you want interactive testing development. Write some code, write some tests, repeat.  The actual ordering of the first 2 steps needs to be decided on a case by case basis.   Writing all of your tests up front can be awkward.  Writing all of your tests at the end is sometimes nearly impossible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dev.theladders.com/2013/02/mutation-testing-with-pit-a-step-beyond-normal-code-coverage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.theladders.com/2013/02/mutation-testing-with-pit-...</a>",1365790847

For example, and in my opinion one of the most successful companies at using social media is the UFC, who first uses social media to interact with fans of the brand (they have bonuses for fighters who use twitter), second as a form of customer service (when people tweet their PPV went out, UFC responds in real-time sending service people out to fix the PPV); and lastly marketing/promotion is an after thought (don't miss tonight's fights #UFC) - probably not a whole lot of measurable ROI but no arguing it is immeasurably increasing brand loyalty.",1365790763

I'm actually in the article never once talking about evaluating the merit of a game on an objective level. It's not about judging games so much as judging how we interact with them. I'm talking about on a personal level, how the game interacts with you, and whether you find value out of it. If you find value only through area MT, that's a thing, I guess. But what if we find other ways of connecting our brains to a game--since the game is affecting those other areas already?

On some level, you and I don't really give a velociraptor's feathers either way what some arbitrary standard says about a game. We care about how the game affects us.<p>What do you think?

Importantly, we don't care where you own your securities. It can be holdings from financial accounts, operating companies, homes, art, private options, manually brokered CDSs, whatever. Shockingly, our customers like to pay us a fair amount of money for this tool alone!<p>On the back end this wasn't easy. We have to normalize the incredibly varied (and often inaccurate) information from banks, third party data providers, excel spreadsheets and other systems. Reconciliation, all day.<p>Second, if facebook has a friend graph, we're creating the financial graph by aggregating ownership across all sources for our customers to analyze and report on.<p>At a high level, the financial world (shockingly) lacks a standardized way of communicating information about ownership and transactions. There are complex and specific protocols like SWIFT and FIX, but no standard way of saying ""this is what I own, this is what I used to own, this is how it's changed, etc."" Banks each make them up with hundreds of unique data formats, often sent with COBOL-style headers. It's 30 year old technology.<p>Long term, we'd like to open this open both as a data format for representing financial data and as a set of APIs for building tools to interact with financial data.<p>To use another analogy, if you wanted to make a phone game in 2004, you had to build a phone. Then the iPhone came out. If you want to make a program to analyze portfolio risk in 2013, you need to build out relationships with an entire network of banks, data providers, and customers. We want to be the ""app store"" for those tools.<p>There are a million other ways to make a platform like this valuable, but I'll save some of the juicier (and more strategic) ones for personal conversations if you're interested :)",1365790211

My brain does not allow me to even consider it as an option. If I am truly sorry, I will masochistically introspect, learn, reiterate, and adjust the scenario until the feeling of saying, ""I'm sorry"", becomes a moot point due to my effort to correct the situation. Words are quite meaningless without action, but action does not seem meaningless without language.<p>I think 'normal' people do this too.  They just have an easier time of convincing themselves of abstract concepts like love, remorse, etc. Looking at myself, I have very primal emotions and filters. There is much self-interest, but I through repetition I have learned to take others into account. This is due to 'others' being a crucial part of what I consider my identity.  Without their language (body, verbal), which I cannot fully utilize/process, I could not exist.<p>I call it my absurd void philosophy. Given that I was placed in a void, stripped of light, sound, floating around aimlessly... I would lose my identity. Without others, there is no me. If I do not take others into consideration, they will not take me into consideration and I would lose my identity. This is the root cause of my social interactions other than habit.<p>How does this play in the workplace? I make mistakes, and I bust my arse to not let the behavior happen again. I utilize the experience to warn others of my shortcomings.<p>As a generous Southern man once said to me, ""Jonathan, some people just want a Thank You letter as gratitude instead of an email or phone call.""

No where in this article does it say ""DAMN YOU FOR NOT FINDING DEEP MEANING IN TETRIS YOU FOOL."" That, I agree with you, would be a little over the top. = P<p>There's another, bigger question to consider: if video games affect your mind so profoundly, it's probably a good idea to think a little before playing. I don't want to rephrase the article to say ""think before buying,"" because that's an obvious part of anything we do--but if your pre-motor cortex actually replicates and primes your motor cortex to perform the Scout's baseball-bashing of Team Fortress 2, don't you at least want to consciously decide on what level it affects you? If you make the conscious decision to transfer TF2 only to area MT--which is essentially what you're arguing--then that decision should be conscious. Rather than just experiencing, isn't it legitimate to consider what your pre-motor cortex is acting out? Is it unreasonable to ask that we be consciencious about the workings of our minds during games?<p>This isn't to say that EVERY SINGLE TIME you play a game you should write a paper and submit it to a game magazine. I would rather you didn't do that, because I would like to do that, and you would be competing, and, yannow, capitalism.<p>This is just to say that it's reasonable to become aware of WHICH areas of your brain are affected--because whether you like it or not, your brain ACTIVELY practices killing.

This applies to all consultancies, not just Oracle.<p>If you hand-roll your own solution for (almost) free using open source components, you're the one who gets fired when it goes down.<p>If you buy an enterprise-level solution from Vendor XYZ, with a requisite expensive support contract, <i>they</i> fucked up when it goes down, and <i>you</i> are safe because goodness, who'd have thought an internationally renowned firm like Vendor XYZ would ever break? Besides, thanks to our expensive support contract, they're on top of it.<p>Microsoft, Oracle, Accenture, they all share one thing in common: their product more CYA for middle managers than anything else.<p>I have similar thoughts about management consulting - it's CYA for high-level execs. You rubber-stamp a risky move with a respected firm so that if the shit hits the fan the firm (and yourself) are insulated from the backlash.",1365789682
5540056,comment,5539110,5539237,13,0,jonnathanson,,,"The answer is actually pretty simple: Pepsi failed at social because Pepsi didn't think socially. It was trying to create new, artificial human behavioral patterns instead of tapping into natural, existing human behavior.<p>Big companies and brands often lose sight of what social media is really about: namely, sharing things with friends. Grouping with people based on shared affinity for certain topics, things, events, etc. People are there for the <i>friends</i> first; all other considerations -- including content consumption -- are secondary.<p>It's incredibly hard to convince people to hang out on a soft drink's social page. What's the benefit? Where is the natural, social use case? If I want a Pepsi, I'll go buy one. When I don't, why the heck would I spend time reading about Pepsi, or talking with friends about Pepsi? Who actually does that? I submit that anyone who does is highly abnormal. Maybe even crazy. Regardless, they're the kind of person whose social feed I'll ignore.<p>As for the Pepsi Refresh campaign, they put the cart before the horse. People care about the cause <i>first</i> and the money second. If I want to raise money to fight breast cancer, for instance, I'll start with the people who <i>care about breast cancer</i>, building out from that passionate early adopter base. I don't just wave a giant paycheck around in front of a highly heterogeneous set of people, asking them to tell me where to spend it. It's a statistically irrational approach to marketing. But more important, there's no heart or soul in that. There's no grassroots need inherent to that. People don't want to vote on a cause. People <i>have causes</i>. Pepsi should have started with a <i>specific cause</i>, and then made waves by offering to match (or even triple) a crowdsourced fundraising campaign.<p>An example: for all its flaws, that infamous ""Kony 2012"" video went uberviral. The video didn't start by asking the question, ""Hey, who's the most despicable African warlord we should try to depose? Vote here!"" It started by informing people about a specific evildoer, educating them about him, and <i>then</i> asking them to do something about it.<p>Pepsi could have generated a lot more authentic goodwill by offering to match or exceed an existing campaign, hashtagging into it. They could have spared themselves the millions of dollars creating a page for their campaign, branding it, and acquiring fans for it.",1365789675

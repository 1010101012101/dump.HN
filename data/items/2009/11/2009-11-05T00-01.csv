A monopoly has no incentive to ""remove"" money from the economy. A profit maximising monopolist in the practically impossible position of being able to price discriminate <i>perfectly</i> such that every customer willing to buy its product at a price above the marginal cost of selling it to them will capture all value created by its product/service, but that just means there's no consumer surplus.

Not cool.<p>That said, I am still confused as to why Dustin thinks AA's website is so relevant to its business model. Their website is not very Web 2.0, it's true.  But, they make up for that... I can fly non-stop from Chicago (my home airport) to thousands of cities around the world on AA quite cheaply.  They have three-class international service, which means I can use frequent flyer miles to get a really nice seat once in a while.  They have lounges.  They have international partners where my status benefits can be used.  I get free domestic upgrades to first class.  They have customer service that cares.  (I have never been greeted by name on Southwest, but it happens rather frequently on AA.)<p>So anyway, the legacies are not totally incompetent.  I fly at least every month and I would never even consider WN or JetBlue.  The fare is about the same, and I have no chance of receiving anything other than a middle-seat on the back of a 737.  No thanks.  Perhaps the website UX is nice, but the rest of the trip won't be.  And when I'm in a metal tube for 18 hours, I don't really give a damn about how much AJAX the website had.<p>(I am a little defensive here, I know.  AA has been really nice to me, so I feel that they deserve some compliments for that.)",1257381688

Lojban isn't that complicated to speak, and most of the times on the forums, people are debating better ways to express sentences, not just because they're incorrect. Also, part of the lojbanic culture is to nag people if their grammar is incorrect. In English, most of the time, people may cringe or roll their eyes if they see someone saying something incorrectly, but it's considered polite in Lojban to correct someone's grammar. We also have a lot of beginners and new learners, so don't be too hard on them - they're just learning. There's a common misconception that logical = complicated, which is entirely not true. Lojban is in many places much simpler than English, and makes a lot more sense.

It's labor intensive, but it can be done.<p>A friend of mine is a niche musical artist who makes a living playing small shows, selling t-shirts, and putting out one new album per year.  He lives comfortably (though by no means lavishly) and has a lot of fun.  His MySpace page says he has 12,000 fans, but his shows usually have 20-50 people, and often, the same people will go to every show they can reasonably drive to, will buy every one of his CDs, and purchase any new t-shirts or stickers (or whatever) that he makes.<p>In other words, he found his group of true fans, and he caters to them by making music and merchandise he knows they'll want.

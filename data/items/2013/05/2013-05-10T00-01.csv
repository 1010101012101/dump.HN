Allowed to go out? I begged and was promptly banned afterwards (whilst I was in year 7) from leaving the house until after my HSC (AU, NSW's final hs exam, but this obviously didn't stick after a few months).<p>Drama? Sports? I was raised by quiet, somewhat anti-social Asian parents all my life, that was never a problem.<p>Computer games? If it's maths related then that was okay (and I put up with it because I was so intrigued with computers and the sums were easy enough after all those self-study maths books).<p>19/20 for a test? Why didn't you get 20/20? Your friend did. Begin silent treatment.<p>I started playing at 7 because there was a program in school and I wanted to be one of the kids who got to leave class for an hour. I loved it at first, and then was moved from the private class to a one-on-one with a specialised teacher. Again, it was something new and I liked it, but it increasingly became tedious and I hated it. I hated the boring music, I hated the scales, I couldn't even reach half the notes whilst playing broken chords. And then I began to despise it. It was only by a slim chance I found an amazing pianist and composer that I fell in love with the piano again.<p>Now that I'm in uni, life is better, and I've found something I love doing. My grades are better and I can work at the same time without it hindering uni work. My mum is definitely not a tiger mum, she's not that bad, but it does make me wonder if I would be excelling as much as I do now if I didn't have all that pressure growing up.",1368147196

5683894,comment,5677220,5683830,1,0,burntsushi,,,"> But they're already elected and already regulating.<p>You missed my point. You can't protect against every kind of malicious behavior. Therefore, whether you have regulation or not, people are going to die from doctors doing stupid/evil things. And <i></i>your<i></i> retort still applies: ""You're fucked. Oh well."" (I'm not saying this justifies freed markets! I'm saying this makes your argument bunk.)<p>This is the third and last time I'm going to say it: your appeal to emotion applies equally in both state regulated markets <i>and</i> freed markets.<p>> The theory goes, people won't go to doctors that reuse stitching needles vs. the doctor down the street who does.<p>That's a red herring to this entire discussion. You were criticizing the idea of ""suing"" being a bad solution and yet, you've dismissed freed markets for a <i>completely different</i> reason here.<p>The whole point of suing in this case is restitution. Just because you're dead because of a gross needle doesn't mean someone can't sue the doctor on your behalf. This gives doctors the same kind of incentive to treat you well in a freed market as in a state regulated market. (e.g., They do bad things and they have to pay a price.)<p>You're trying to discuss two entirely separate issues: 1) pressures on consumers aren't good enough to keep them away from bad people and 2) pressures on doctors aren't good enough to keep them from doing bad things. I recommend refocusing your argument to clarify what exactly it is you're trying to say.<p>And if you can't manage a polite response, then g'day.",1368147170

Just because he said it doesn't make it true, though.<p>I don't forget it, because calling a function and creating a new object are 2 totally different things. If one can't distinguish between those, then they should probably be tutored in programming 101 because you're going to end up with a lot more serious problems than a ctor accidentally called as a normal function.<p>Also, and I'm going out on a limb here, but I'd hazard a guess that a majority of programmers using JS will have experience with at least 1 other language (if not many) which use the very same paradigm of creating objects. I can think of a handful off the top of my head, with several of them having a virtually identical syntax (C#, Java, PHP).",1368147105

If you're going to consult professionally, you need to be able to sign reasonable NDAs.<p>What that probably means is, you need to get a lawyer to do contract review for you. In other words, every NDA you sign is going to cost you a couple hundred bucks.<p>Early on, you might eyeball NDAs and then sign them (D.C. Toedt's resource posted crossthread being one way to do that), but once you have an established practice, the risk/reward on freelancing your own legal review stops making any sense at all.<p>Anybody who tells you consultants never sign NDAs is someone who doesn't do serious consulting. How could it even be <i>possible</i> to consult seriously without signing NDAs? You'd only be able to work on and with public information for clients. I get the sense that a lot of this ""never! no NDA!"" sentiment is a mix of two things: (a) confusion over the fact that venture capitalists don't sign NDAs (though maybe they should) and (b) the fact that a lot of people who call themselves consultants are really doing one-off freelance work for tiny companies, which, sure, if that's your cup of tea, but...",1368147087

""Ultimately, a real understanding of history means that we face NOTHING new under the sun.""

Study their decision making processes, study their customers, read whatever you can read to find the people who have done what you are doing.<p>Chances are the business that you are creating (even if it is going to ""disrupt"" some industry or another) is still dealing with the same issues that have always been issues. It's going to have HR, marketing, leadership, operations and a million other hassles that are similar to those that have come before. Similar because people haven't changed that much.<p>If you are a startup person, working 100 hour weeks and learning by doing, you should still find some time to read and learn from the mistakes and triumphs of those who came before. Don't burn the investors cash relearning the lessons that someone else already learnt, save your runway for iterating on the true unknowns of your problem domain.",1368146834

A lot of people that do not know the fellows and other finalists don't realize that we have gained a lot of knowledge and experience in our fields prior to applying for the fellowship. I've had three years experience in hardware prototyping and development at MIT, and have been hacking and tinkering for a much longer time. The $100k is there to allow you to follow your dreams... both as a safety net and a way to cover personal expenses. A lot of us hope to or are in the process of receiving Angel, VC, or some other form of funding to better cover our projects.<p>As for whether it is a responsible thing to do, a large part of what the fellowship is is a ""life accelerator"", as the money is virtually ""no strings attached"" (Well, there are quarterly ""check in"" review meetings, with review forms.) There isn't a temptation to spend all the money at once as it is given in monthly payments (Though you can ask for a larger sum as long as you give a good reason.) While I suppose you aren't able to trust me due to my bias, I would say that myself and a majority of the other fellows would be ""responsible"" with the money we receive just on the fact that we want to succeed. I take great pride in my work, and want to fulfill the cliche of ""changing the world"", and I will continue trying. I think my sense of responsibility developed just like anyone else (even if the average person typically only becomes what society considers 'responsible' during/after college)... if you want to achieve something, whether it be to launch a product and start a company, get a job, buy a house, or have a family, you find a way to do it and try as hard as you can to do it. I hope that the other fellows and I are able to show that young people are able to do these things, and these ""life lessons"" can be learned at a much earlier age than most people think, and that we can truly change the world...with or without a piece of paper telling us what we know.",1368146696

5683738,comment,5680258,5680258,1,0,DigitalSea,,,"""many designers dont have the time to learn the WordPress Codex. Its huge. Its intimidating. Its confusing.""  maybe it's just because I know Wordpress quite well, but the documentation I found when learning years ago (it's even better now) wasn't difficult at all. The Wordpress community is so big that you can Google solutions to most problems, find solutions and learn at the same time.<p>Of course being a designer and not a developer, you're going to struggle learning syntax and convention (that goes for any language or application like Wordpress). Stick with it, the Codex is great.<p>It's true the Twenty Ten and Twenty Eleven default Wordpress themes were bloated and if you were trying to use them as a base or learn, you'd probably be overwhelmed by the kitchen sink approach the core team took when creating those themes. Having said that, if you want a clean starting base for a theme, try using the bundled Twenty Twelve: <a href=""http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentytwelve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentytwelve</a>  which is arguably the best default theme ever to grace Wordpress. Most naked themes you encounter for Wordpress aren't naked at all (Bones especially abstracting an already abstracted CMS even more).<p>Having said that, this naked theme looks good. It's actually naked and well commented but not naked to the point it's really any less simple than Twenty Twelve (just less files). The benefit of considering a default theme as a starting base is that you get to see how the experts develop a Wordpress theme and the added bonus of how to use the custom background functionality and the Theme Customization API as well.<p>This kind of reminds me of my Actual Barebones HTML5 Github: <a href=""https://github.com/Vheissu/Actually-Barebones-HTML5-Template"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Vheissu/Actually-Barebones-HTML5-Template</a>  It's literally a HTML file that gives you a HTML5 structure without assuming you want jQuery or anything of the sorts.

5683735,comment,5682666,5683458,1,0,rooker,,,"I disagree. The problem lies in the definition of ""passion,"" which a lot of people take to mean that it's going to be some sort of thrilling, meaningless underwater basket weaving. In reality, combining interest and hard work can lead to more fulfillment than simply drudging in and out of an 8-hour work day to collect a paycheck. When a person simply believes that they're working for a paycheck, their satisfaction will tend to decrease, as the paycheck starts to seem smaller and smaller with regard to the amount of time they're putting in. 8 hours a day is no small chunk of one's life. It also doesn't have to be the most fulfilling time in a person's day, but to say that having a passion for your work is a BS ideal (and to attribute it to baby boomers at that) is oversimplifying the issue.<p>That said, you're completely right that living a normal life is not enough for some people. These people will tend to be either extraordinary or extremely depressed, all the while thinking they're normal/below normal.",1368144266

Even with the banner, plaintiff / prosecution lawyers could argue that you were inducing infringement - otherwise, why use a banner and not one of the widely available IP geolocation databases for an IP based block? Why, for example, sell to credit cards issued by US banks? Obviously, if you put more effective technical measures in place, but people from the US are, say, using a non-US proxy and paying by BitCoin, it might be easier to defend.<p>If someone in NZ breaks US law, there is then a question of whether they can face any consequences for it if they never leave NZ. Patents law has both a civil and a criminal aspect to it.<p>Under NZ civil law, the New Zealand courts can enforce civil judgements made against a New Zealand resident person, but only if the matter doesn't relate to taxes, and the person was either physically in the jurisdiction that made the judgement on the day the suit was filed, or the person takes any action in the foreign lawsuit other than arguing lack of jurisdiction.<p>New Zealanders can be extradited to face criminal charges abroad, but subject to the following test: ""if the conduct of the person constituting the offence in relation to the extradition country, or equivalent conduct, had occurred within the jurisdiction of New Zealand at the relevant time it would, if proved, have constituted an offence punishable under the law of New Zealand for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for not less than 12 months or any more severe penalty"". That doesn't necessarily stop long and protracted proceedings - Kim Dotcom was probably protected by the safe harbour provisions under New Zealand copyright law.<p>Even if someone is safe from civil enforcement of a foreign judgement or criminal extradition, the US might still have power over them. For example, if they have assets in the US, they might not be safe. How do people pay to download the software - if it involves a payment system with US operations, like Visa or Mastercard, they might still be able to shut it down or garnish customer payments. Selling only by BitCoin might seriously hurt conversion rates.",1368144072

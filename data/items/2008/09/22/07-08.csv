A user may know what copy and paste does in <i>Microsoft WORD</i>, but they do not see this as anything but a feature of Word. They don't think it is something that is generally applicable to all text fields. That concept is naturally unintuitive, it's something that has to be learned or discovered.<p>I'm technically very saavy, but open id is something I really don't want to use. It sounds complicated, it's difficult to use, it seems risky, and most importantly, it does not offer me any advantages.<p>It's a silly idea pushed by technologists who are out of touch with what the average person is doing with his computer.",1222070141

Sure it was an innovative product, but I still see Yahoo running around with a search team and with a still sizeable chunk of the search business (~25% isn't anything to scoff at whatsoever)",1222069790

The risk isn't so much that one big firm will go under, but that some firms going under will set off a panic that will force lots of firms to go under.

If there were more consolidation wouldn't it just aggravate this risk of one failure causing a significant impact?<p>Like I said before, I'm not an economist, but it seems better to keep the WaMu's and Goldman Sachs' separate, in more or less mutually exclusive risk pools so that if GS fails, the deposits in WaMu don't go with it.<p>Anyway, good points!

Investment banking was regarded as a golden standard for 'making it'. So no more, now that investment banking has gone down the toilet.<p>These companies will still be conducting Investment Banking activities. There are other bank holding companies who also own investment banks (Citigroup, and I believe JP Morgan, in addition to a host of foreign banks like UBS). What this means is that they will be forced to adopt capital requirements and other regulation in their portfolio business and take on two new regulators in exchange for more financial stability from deposits and access to Federal Reserve funds.<p>>* Regulation / Legislation Ironic, but the Glass-Steagall Act which was enacted in 1933 after the great depression was precisely the OPPOSITE: To separate commercial banking from investment banking!

Also, having diversified business lines should make these firms less likely to fail. Glass-Steagal made firms more fragile.

310911,comment,310563,310852,0,0,netcan,,,"There are definitely all sorts of problematic incentive structures all over the place. And they're definitely a problem. I think that just goes to show they're inevitable to a degree, that they're survivable & that free markets are not a silver bullet. These bailouts are certainly a push in the wrong direction, but unless I'm missing something, they're a very minor push. As you say, options as incentive are worse.<p>Compared to the other effects, that doesn't even show up on any kind of radar. For one thing, these companies are now essentially nationalised. Just the implications in terms of international politics & rhetoric are pretty big.<p>What did nationalisation do to the incentives of shareholders of other too-big-to-fail companies? What did it do the the execs. From the 1 year ago perspective this is still failure. 'This stock might lose 100% of it's worth' & 'this stock might lose 93%' look very similar when you are sitting on 100%. If any kind of serious distortion happens it probably happens near the bottom when things are pretty chaotic anyway. Executive compensation might be causing distortions, but the US' new found nationalisation policy has nothing to do with that.",1222067244

310907,comment,310806,310830,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Bank holding companies are subject to risk-based capital requirements which prohibit them from operating with high leverage or purchasing large amounts of risky assets. Basically, these companies are reorganizing to adopt a lower risk and lower return model.<p>>This means that there is a need for new restrictions placed on the hybrid banks. If the regulation is too low, then we run the risk of putting deposits in danger.<p>Regulators are way ahead of you. As bank holding companies they will be subject to a TON of regulation. Few firms are more regulated. Both the FDIC and the Federal Reserve will have authority over them.<p>It's good that Glass-Steagal was repealed since it allows them to take these risk-reducing moves. It also broadens the supply of capital that is capable of supporting the financial industry in hard times (see J.P. Morgan/Bear Stearns and BOA/Merrill Lynch). With Glass-Steagal, the default reorganization move would be failure rather than merger. More federal government money would be at risk in bail-outs rather than private money put at risk in mergers.<p>Also, diversified financial companies have weathered the storm far better than their more focused peers. Being big and diversified has its advantages in tough times, as one would expect.<p>It's weird that the Glass-Steagal Act keeps popping up as much as it is. As far as I know its repeal had nothing to do with the current crisis, and probably helped alleviate it. I thought this link had a good summary of the Glass-Steagal act as it pertains to the current crisis:<p><a href=""http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/clear_as_glass_steagall.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/clear_a...</a>",1222066870
310906,comment,310678,310851,0,0,rantfoil,,,"There are a few varieties of convertible debt -- one is with a discount, and another is with a pre-money cap.<p>Lots of investors will insist on pre-money cap at a reasonable seed valuation. This basically means later when you do a series A or change of control, the investor's money converts with the Series A, and they get reimbursed typically with additional common stock that would simulate that valuation as if they did equity.<p>Straight up convertible debt with only a discount actually does NOT align the entrepreneur's goals with the investor... the investor gets a fixed percentage discount off the Series A price, but what if they put in $100k at year 0 and the company is now worth $10 million later at year 1 (rare but not unrealistic example)? That $20k profit with the 20% discount is starting to look like an awful move.<p>History lesson: Back in the day, notes were common just to really ""bridge"" startups from seed to Series A. They were issued to startups by the same VC that was already planning to do a Series A with them -- so the discount was fine because the VC would set the valuation as well. It's different now because your note investor (angel, friends or family) probably won't be the pricing your next round -- more likely, the market will.<p>Now it just doesn't make sense for most investors since they can take a chance on a team, do a note with a discount, and then see no significant return if the team is successful and raises the next round at a much higher valuation.<p>This article is actually kind of messed up because it assumes that you priced your round poorly, and then uses that as an explanation for why debt is good. If everyone is doing their job, and you're planning for success, then do a cap... or heck, do equity with YC's Series AA.",1222066869

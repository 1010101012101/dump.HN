Back in 2004, under growing pressure from Washington, and in response to outsiders who accused the school of (a) elitism and (b) hoarding its immense wealth, Larry Summers shook up the world of higher education by announcing that students whose parents earned $40,000 a year or less would be able to attend Harvard gratis. Two years later, that cutoff was increased to $60,000, a figure well above the median U.S. household income.<p>Still, Harvard pressed ahead in its efforts to ease the growing burden of tuition. In December 2007, declaring that excellence and opportunity must go hand in hand, the university’s new president, Drew Faust, made another stunning announcement: henceforth, students whose parents earn as much as $180,000 a year would pay no more than 10 percent of their family’s annual income in tuition fees.</i>",1254930632

Also, the real-time scanner is limited. It does not do a full check on every file because that is too expensive (though it might be damn close), with the GPU they might have the power to make scanning through your whole computer 99% moot since every time any program executes the virus scanner gives it a 100% scan, fast, without the user even noticing that it happened.<p>I can see lots of benefits of this.

I've long been a proponent of TDD once you pass the prototyping stage and you need to write a production-ready component with [most of] the edge cases figured out.<p>The ""red green refactor"" loop is more like:<p>1) What's the next problem this software needs to solve?\n2) Write a failing test that demonstrates the missing need.\n3) Implement said behavior.\n4) Refactor until you don't see anything else to refactor.<p>I think step #1 is one of the most important and yet I don't see much discussion of it.  Pick the most ""key"" tests to write first, whether that be your happy path or the functionality that has the most risk.<p>On refactoring...  I work with people who TDD all of their work and other who write unit tests afterwards.  In my experience, those who test-drive are more comfortable refactoring otherwise.

We've hardly touched the code since.  It solves the right problem with the right amount of code and I think it's only had a couple very obscure race conditions.<p>In summary, TDD is one of my favorite tools for focusing my efforts so we build what we need, but only what we need.",1254930489

It literally has nowhere else to go, which is why it is now buying property across the Charles river in Boston across from HBS.<p>While it is always fun to criticize ""elite schools"" for their snobbery, I would suggest that the administration of Harvard actually had a rather simple decision: keep harvard at the scale and size that has proven successful for decades upon decades, or build a satellite campus to hold new students so it can grow it's size. A dimension of a university that is hard to put a dollar amount on is community. While building a satellite campus in Boston is possible, I think this would <i>seriously</i> damage the community, and thus output, of the school by dividing it into two disjoint locations.<p>Anyway..

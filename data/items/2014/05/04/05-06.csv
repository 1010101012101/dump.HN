Product developers are jealous of the fast iterations involved with software development. I&#x27;ve recently learned that despite being lower quality, people value the novelty of 3D printed goods. And we know that consumers value co-creation [1].<p>We know that early adopters tend to be early adopters of multiple kinds of technology. So if your user base for a new physical product also largely have 3D printers, you could bring your users into your prototyping process. Send out 2+ versions of your product without them knowing which version they received.<p>You can ask for feedback within 2 days of pushing out a design with real users. From the feedback you can start a new iteration, which you can then push out to your users as a tangible update within a week. You could even pay for the small cost of material used.<p>This platform could start with STL files, and then in the future use a common 3D printing API such as the one we&#x27;re building called PrintToPeer. Early adopters would even be incentivized to get a 3D printer to be a part of the development cycle of new products.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect</a>",1399183162
7693447,comment,7693249,7693249,5,0,kev009,,,"I live in a strange duality according to this article.  I&#x27;m in my mid-20s and have accomplished much of my childhood goals.  I knew I wanted to be a professional developer at a young age and have quickly risen to my choice of companies, locations, and roles doing this.  I&#x27;m aware of my mortality, but death itself doesn&#x27;t scare me in the sense that if I died tomorrow and had some way to reflect I would certainly not regret any of the things I have or have not done.  And not because I&#x27;ve made spectacularly good decisions or have done anything extraordinary; I simply accept the randomness of the world.  The thing that really drives me is taming that randomness, eliminating inefficiency with small and clean systems, and helping others do the same.  Some cultures seem to be catatonic with death - to me it&#x27;s an event that happens to all of us - so in practice I fall in line with the article but I guess with different implementation.  For me, it is very liberating to live outside of all fear.",1399183161

Just from watching the video, it looks like thumb.it just has up/down votes on one image, with optional additional feedback.<p>The advantage of having two images is the voter doesn&#x27;t even need to read a description or know what part of the image they&#x27;re supposed to up/down vote.  They should be able to easily see the difference between the two and just make a snap decision in less than a second.

7693438,comment,7693262,7693262,1,0,theseoafs,,,"Relational binary data serialization.<p>Cap&#x27;n Proto is a great piece of engineering that got quite a lot of things right. (For those who aren&#x27;t familiar, Cap&#x27;n Proto is a data serialization format that is able to be very fast by encoding data in the same way modern processors encode data normally - with fixed width data types and pointers.) I think it would be nice to have a data serialization protocol that uses the same general concepts, but addresses a couple limitations in that format, including:<p>- Cap&#x27;n Proto doesn&#x27;t allow you to edit messages in a robust way. You can&#x27;t change the size of a list/string in a message, you can&#x27;t replace one object with another without leaking &quot;garbage&quot;, etc. The data model is simply not designed with fast editing in mind.  \n- The data model is document based so it is inconvenient or impossible to capture certain kinds of relationships with a schema.<p>My idea is to address these limitations using the battle tested relational model and the massive amount of knowledge that&#x27;s been accumulated about how to efficiently implement relational systems. In this serialization format, a message would be a veritable relational dataset, complete with a schema and multiple tables. Messages would be organized into pages, each page representing a node in a b tree, as in a normal rdbms. You can add, edit, and delete rows as necessary, and just send the binary encoding of the database over the wire directly. The utility of this system is obvious: a client could, for example,  read an entire database from one server, add a row to a table (without parsing the rest of the message, which are in other tables on other pages), and forward the new database directly to another server. Being able to quickly edit even large datasets in this way would be a huge boon.",1399183013

This is a bad idea in case there is a chance the key gets eventually leaked, then you&#x27;ll be able to decrypt all past communications.  But as long as you create and use a sufficiently long key pair, and make sure nobody ever has access to it, communication will be pretty secure.<p>With DHE the problem is you have to create a new key per connection.  This requires high-quality randomness (sufficient entropy) all the time.  Now if randomness is just compromised one time, the attacker will be able to decrypt one communication session.  You may say, no problem, it&#x27;s just one session, secrecy will be reestablished the next session.  However, compromising a single session is often as worse as compromising all sessions.  A single session will give you access to session cookies, maybe to a user&#x27;s password.  It may allow you to inject malicious code and permanently back-door a victim&#x27;s system.<p>Since the Dual_EC_DRBG disaster we saw how vulnerable &quot;randomness&quot; can be.  Also attacks on a random number generator cannot be detected at all, if done correctly.<p>There are other caveats: With everybody going for ephemeral keys, people may think, less bits will be just safe enough, as it&#x27;s just an &quot;ephemeral&quot; key.  That&#x27;s currently the problem with the apache shipped with most older Linux distros: DHE is hard-coded to merely use 1024-bit keys.<p>Also there may be attacks that work more efficiently if you have many session keys to break: i.e. if breaking a single key takes time N, breaking one out of M keys may just take M/N time.  So getting a single session of a user and backdoor&#x27;ing his system may actually get easier with ephemeral keys.<p>Not saying that I&#x27;m opposed, but these kind of blunt decisions won&#x27;t make me feel more secure.",1399181184

The analogy to physics is especially fascinating. I have only kept up with the literature, not seriously implemented it, so I could be wrong. But what I understand is that while simulated annealing is good for many things, it hasn&#x27;t shown itself to be best for anything and the improvements on it have tended to changes that weakened the analogy with physics [1]. I find this disappointing since in its raw form, simulated annealing suggested a sort of &quot;physics of information processing&quot; mapping hard computation problems to states of matter.

If I remember correctly, kazaa had a mode that worked like this.<p>Suppose you&#x27;d do it really, really simple. If you watch a netflix show, you download an encrypted version, and start serving it on your IP address on ports 80 and 443, http and https (wouldn&#x27;t work with NAT of course, but ...). Then inform central servers that this link exists and the central server tells 1/10000 of next requests to download it from you. Now split up the files into 1000 pieces each, and make it work like that. It could take care of tracerouting to everyone and try to &quot;group&quot; requests with the most overlapping traceroutes.<p>Bittorrent is a brutally simple protocol, compared to it&#x27;s predecessors, and I&#x27;d say, even compared to things like http and https. Running bittorrent over http or https would not be very hard.<p>Keep in mind that there&#x27;s also an advantage for the providers. What the providers really want is payment for building network infrastructure. Given how hard that is becoming, and the fact that it&#x27;s not linear (for linearly increasing endpoints and bandwidth you need exponentially increasing network equipment and transfer lines), they should be ecstatic about efforts to turn traffic back as soon in their network as possible, it would offload their core networks, and they can sure use that.<p>Contrary to what people think here, in most cases ISPs only throttle p2p traffic either between their distribution and core layers, or between their core and peering (second makes more sense financially, but it may not be the same organization). So p2p traffic between you and your neighbor is not throttled at all. This is done because firewalls that can reliably separate p2p traffic from other traffic are expensive, so one tries to avoid sending all core traffic through them. Throttling p2p in the access servers is quite expensive, and will give customers (even more) the impression that their line is throttled at all times.<p>(also in most ISPs even a basic business connection will bypass p2p throttles, given that the cost difference between customer connections and basic business connections is little or nonexistent these days, you may want to consider switching)",1399180941

There are cultural differences too.<p>For example, if I&#x27;m translating a cricket (the sport)-themed story from Australian English into Japanese, do I retain the cricket references, and have the meaning be unintelligible to Japanese readers with no knowledge of cricket? This is what Eco refers to as source translation, which is closer to a literal translation.<p>Or I could change the cricket references to baseball, which is more appropriate in a Japanese context, and Eco refers to as target translation. The purpose here is to convey the feeling, more than remaining true to the literal meaning of the original text.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://books.google.com.au/books/about/Mouse_Or_Rat.html?id=I4FtQgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com.au/books/about/Mouse_Or_Rat.html?id=...</a>",1399180615

That&#x27;s a pretty normal way to set up remotely-adminned fairly secure servers.<p>When it&#x27;s &quot;cold&quot; (offline, or running but in system-low mode), you have no real protection of the OS, but you essentially distrust the machine whenever it gets rebooted without your consent.  If someone can get root on the server while it&#x27;s in &quot;high mode&quot; (normal operation, after keys are entered), any protections are irrelevant anyway.<p>The risk is if the attacker can cause enough reboots that you stop caring about reboots so much, and just blindly enter the passphrase; the attacker then puts up something which steals the passphrase, and then uses the passphrase on an already-imaged drive, winning the game.  Or if the attacker can use one of a large number of vulnerabilities to get access to your data when it&#x27;s running in system-high mode; either an app-level vulnerability or either local access + local root, or remote root.<p>Server technology sucks for anything needing great security but adminned strictly remotely.",1399179957

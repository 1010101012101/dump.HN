2859310,comment,2858356,2858983,7,0,kristiandupont,,,"I switched to mac from windows a couple of months ago. I guess I am still waiting for the magic to happen.<p>OS X is fine. There are the initial annoyances which I was expecting, like the different hotkeys. Fine, I got over most of those pretty quickly. But there are things that still annoy me. For instance, there seems to be only one hotkey that opens the application menu. On Windows I am used to pressing the alt-key and then the given underlined letter of the menu that I want to open. I have a lot of ""secondary"" hotkeys memorized this way. In Photoshop for instance, ""alt+i, p"" is ""crop"" -- there is no (default) hotkey for crop and now I have to use the mouse.<p>Not using Lion yet so I couldn't say if the fullscreen mode is going to cure my longing for maximize but the point of that green plus-thing on every window is completely beyond me. The reason I maximize windows is because I want to focus on a single thing, not because I want to see a bit more of content.<p>I prefer Explorer to Finder. I'm sure this will get better but again it feels like Finder was made for the mouse more than the keyboard, compared to Explorer (mac-gurus, how can I see and copy the path that I am currently browsing?).
I also prefer the behavior of alt-tab in Windows of switching between windows rather than apps. The fact that two documents happen to be opened by the same executable seems arbitrary to me and it annoys me that I have to first switch to the app I want and then to the window I want.<p>There is, I think, a noticeable difference in the way processes and threads are prioritized. I am sure OSX is better at this but it mostly just feels different to me. Processes seem less able to take down the entire system but on the other hand, music playing apps will sometimes lag which seems to never happen on Windows.<p>All that said, I am still happy. I <i>love</i> the hardware. The air has enough performance for me (even running two simultaneous win7 vm's with visual studio) and I get happy every time I double check my bag to make sure I remembered my laptop because it's so light. And there are definitely upsides to OSX such as Spotlight which feels like your own personal google (with everything including calculator and dictionary) whereas on Windows it feels like all search gets me is the indexer eating up all my cpu.",1312793621

2) a monetization of debt is equivalent to a partial default. if you bought a bunch of securities so you could cash them in 10 years to buy 20 hamburgers but now you can only buy 10 hamburgers because the price level has risen faster than you expected then this is equivalent to a 50% partial default. however, bondholders would prefer a country monetizes before it partially defaults (all other things being equal) because then they don't take 100% of the burden of default.<p>but i think you are correct in that it is mostly willingness to pay. also, it is not just the congressman but treasury as well which came out and said it couldn't prioritise debt payments. treasury might be correct morally and legally but it doesn't inspire confidence in bondholders. :)",1312791760

That all ends about two years ago. This is when I started buying digital books on my wife's account.<p>She's not much of an Amazon user, but I bought her a Kindle as a gift first, so...we already had a bunch of digital books attached to her account. So now Amazon has a lot of data about a sort of split personality woman who likes anthropology, travel, cooking, etc. as well as math, programming, photography, etc. This is a massive fail and a loss to Amazon in my mind.<p>The reason I don't want to buy two of everything, aside from the obvious fact that I don't do this in the real world (i.e., physical books), is that I don't expect these copies to be valid in 10 years. Any DRM-based data is likely to become invalid over time unless it's eventually stripped. Why would I pay twice for that? In addition, it's lower fidelity than the physical book or an equivalent PDF. So I'll probably have to buy it again anyway.<p>Apple figured this out and now sells MP3s and, ironically, Amazon also sells DRM-free MP3s. I'm sure they're trying to bring publishers into the 21st century. They're just not doing it very well yet.",1312790940

I'm not that sure if anybody would be interested in using it without the language, because it won't provide any features for regular JS developer. As a Coffeescript developer, do you need any of:<p>* Static typed language on client-side<p>* Allow your Java developers to build complex maintainable UI without advanced JS knowledge<p>* Reuse existing Java code<p>* Use Java tools (IDE, Unit testing, Build systems)<p>It's very hard to build a complex JS app, because even guys who develop for web in dynamic languages like PHP, Python or Ruby - usually produce the ""callbacked-jquery-unmaintainable-mess"" on the front end. There are tools like Backbone which are becoming more and more popular, but learning them and all new JS patterns is more complex then GWT for a regular Java developer. Supporting other JVM languages is also hard task, AFAIR GWT isn't working with JVM bytecode when converting Java to JS. Microsoft tried this way with Volta, but failed.<p>Cappuccino brings you a rock solid API and a language that makes this API nicely usable (you can use it without Obj-J, but it will look ugly). Look at other popular frameworks: ExtJS, SproutCore - both changed their vision heavily with latest versions. Cappuccino is aimed for Apple/Cocoa minded developers, and Obj-J seems to be the best fit the same way as GWT is for Java.<p>I really don't see how you can make products like GWT & Cappuccino without their languages, because the reason why they were built were those languages and tight integration in first place. Otherwise they would become yet another library of widgets.",1312790762

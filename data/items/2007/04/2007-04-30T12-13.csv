The advent of AJAX gave Dreamweaver a little more life, since to make an impressive AJAX page requires a ridiculous amount of not very well structured code.  Keeping track of not very well structured code is what IDE's are good at, and what Dreamweaver's target audience is bad at.  That said, as a percentage of total revenues, Dreamweaver sucks.  Check it out for yourself in Adobe's latest quarterly report:<p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/sec?s=ADBE"">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/sec?s=ADBE</a><p>Dreamweaver sales were used to bump up the ""Developer Solutions"" line of the quarterly report.  Notice it is a small percentage.  This would not be so bad, until you notice that even the line in the quarterly report marked ""Other"" is bigger!<p>Here's some free advice, do not invest in a startup that plans to make a straight IDE play.",1177937912

Also the sponsors love it and provide food and wine for the networking events.
Then the Mums and Dads also read about start-ups in the news and people everywhere are more supportive of entrepreneurship

Ryan Dahl even looked at Haskell before choosing V8, said the language is ideal but hacking GHC was too complex:<p><i>>I was into Ruby for a while, I said, but eventually the VM just drove me insane, because it's just so slow, every time you try to make it faster you realize: ""OK, I am just going to write this part in C"" and every single line of Ruby that you add to your application, actually just slows down the server noticeably. And so eventually I just kind of ended up with this big C thing that I was kind of happy with, like OK I could write a web server with it and I could do file IO and so I had for a long time the idea of ""I would have this kind of library that abstracted some part of the problem away and people can write it in C and they can write their little web servers.<p>People don't like writing stuff in C. Basically I want to put people in this non-blocking environment because it is the right way to design a server, it just kind of maneuvering around all the other pieces of the computer system and I would really like to do such a thing in Haskell or some sort of declarative language like this, where you could literally be purely functional when you receive events off of the socket, because all your side effects would happen on the event loop and you would just allow that to happen and then you kind of get a function call with some data and you would do whatever with that, make some call which would not have a side effect, you just write something to some buffer that would get flushed to the kernel and then you drop back down to the event loop.<p>Side effects would happen, everything would happen and then you get another call from that. But when you are receiving an event from the event loop you could be purely functional, you could really have nothing to do with anybody else and that is attractive. But you look in the GHC code and it's very hard and I am not such a good programmer and I gave up on that. And then V8 came out and it just kind of clicked. I am not a Javascript originally, have nothing to do with that really, but it just seams like a natural sort of thing once I started poking around VA.</i><p>1.  <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/interviews/node-ryan-dahl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/interviews/node-ryan-dahl</a>",1347184593

In the Reddit AmA thread by a patent examiner a month ago, he said that works publicly released anywhere in the world prior to the filing count as prior art, and gave the example of paper fans in Vietnam. The issue is that the patent examiners don't have the time or ability to seek out every possible piece of prior art in the world.<p>Hopefully the state of software patents can be changed at the source, when they tighten patent granting.

4495426,comment,4494666,4494666,2,0,20120910,,,"I'm not as articulate or insightful as other commenters on HN, and I don't have any silly platitudes to lift you up, and even if I did, it wouldn't be help in any way. So please forgive the rambling and stream-of-consciousness that follows herein. Just like yourself, I also created a throwaway account because my HN nick is my handle elsewhere.<p>You're in a trough - call it depression, a slump, burnout, whatever. We all go through it - there's no defined beginning and no defined end. Some may experience just a brief episode once at some point in their careers and are ever so lucky to avoid the personal side effects, some may revisit it multiple times throughout life, and some have remained stuck in one big trough from since as far back as they can remember. Sometimes troughs are forks of consequence, sometimes they're a result of our personal demons gaining the upper hand, and sometimes we're just plain unlucky.<p>I can assure you though, that you are most certainly not alone.<p>Here's a confession: up until a few months ago, I was near the lowest point of a very deep and seemingly pitch black trough which lasted roughly three years. Just like yourself, I was long-term unemployed (I'm an independent contractor, so technically I still am unemployed) and in my job hunt, I was branded ""unhireable"" (actual word from recruiter) - chalk it up to my pursuing too many fields when younger, not dedicating to one job, or not choosing to build a brand (e.g. projects, blog, twitter, blech). At times, I felt as if I were at the top of a Silicon Valley blacklist for reasons unbeknownst only to myself. And, similar to your situation, I severed many personal relationships, some irreparably - all the stories of success or excess that I saw on social networks, on blogs, on HN etc etc etc were magnified by my selective attention and self-doubt to the point that I became completely withdrawn and questioned what good I was to myself, let alone my friends. Shame, depression, paranoia, helplessness. These are all attachments that I couldn't shake. Every minor success, I'd scrutinize its origins, wondering what strings were attached and how soon before I'd manage to fuck it up.<p>Here's the scary part. I can't tell you that it will get better soon, because frankly, that's an unfair expectation, and there's also a chance that it won't. You will hit rock-bottom at some point - for me, it was last October after I also moved in with family. All that negative energy and those feelings of limited self-worth, as intense as they may seem now, will multiply and your already tired and rewired mind will conjure deep-edge thoughts that'll frighten the shit out of you, and lead you to drastically change your life in more than one way. And you'll only know that you hit rock-bottom weeks or months after it happens, when progress leads to forgetting your worries and you occasionally have time to stop and reflect upon the relative shittiness of days past.<p>Why am I saying this? Because you need to know what you're in for when it looks like things can't get any worse.<p>You can delude yourself and listen to those who say that a positive attitude, networking, determination, and patience is all you need. But brother, I can assure you that amounts to nothing when rejection after rejection will tear away at the widest of fake smiles and the chipperness of upbeat conversations you try to have with recruiters.<p>There's no sense in assigning blame to your current emotional state or dwelling on any one of several mistakes you've made in the past. Even the best decisions you've made could've turned pear-shaped otherwise.<p>The good news, however, is that if you remain strong, you will eventually get out of your trough. You're obviously seeking the right path by telling us your story and looking for guidance, which takes exponentially more courage than the alternative.<p>Here's some general advice, taking cues from what I did to emerge from the dark. YMMV:<p>* If your passions lie outside web/mobile, then don't pursue web/mobile. I hated what I was unfortunately good at. I pivoted towards new disciplines in my consulting practice that both challenged and interested me, and which were at the very edge of my sweet spot in terms of expertise. I found new work by lowering my rate and targeting more forgiving clients, which took a lot of time (and a LOT more rejection).<p>* You shouldn't worry about pay or the caliber of company at this point. Just find the right environment that you believe you'll thrive in and immerse yourself for a few months or a couple years. Compensation should matter nothing to you at this point. You obviously can't get the pay you want, because you're not qualified. Nor can you pursue an internship or entry-level role in a high-growth placement, because you lack the vigor and momentum of a younger alternative. Any port in a storm - take what you can get, and make it better.<p>* Don't feel that you have to <i>reinvent</i> yourself by learning a breadth of new skills. Build yourself anew atop the many things that you do like or are good at, and dedicate yourself to being really really good at one thing (basically, affirm your ""t-shape"" in HR 2.0 parlance).<p>* If ""selling yourself"" feels wrong, that's completely normal. It's called humility. Many today lack it. It's a curse professionally, but often a blessing personally. Take stock of what you have done really well in the past and what you genuinely want to do, package it into a story, recite it recite it and recite it some more, and the ""selling"" will be natural instead of forced and disingenuous.<p>* I don't have the context, but I'm sure you were rejected by the burger joint because you're of far greater value elsewhere - you don't know it, but they did. That, and based on what they see in your personality and background, you're unstable, unreliable and can't follow orders - three red-flags. Why should they take that risk, regardless of how smart you may be compared to the average line cook? Count your blessings - that would have been a dead-end.<p>* As ryanmolden points out, your serendipity is not in your immediate surroundings - go find it. Get out of the house and busy yourself as much as you can. Find venues that challenge you or provide fulfillment. For me, it was hiking the East Bay trails and volunteering at Habitat for Humanity GSF - anything that would create enough fatigue to displace my negative energy. More importantly, establish a sense of routine and discipline - I did this through daily gym sessions, teaching myself Python (have a LONG way to go), learning Spanish and refreshing my Calculus. Above all, don't tie any expectation of success to these goals (e.g. if you improve your Haskell, your chances of employment improve) because 1) frustration will likely follow from time seemingly wasted and 2) you're learning new things for the wrong reason.<p>Again, YMMV. Understand that there's no prescribed way out of any trough, and <i>this will take time</i>. Also remember in the short-term what what you're experiencing is perfectly normal. You'll be a better person once you emerge from the dark, and hopefully you'll be set on the right path for the long-term.<p>Most importantly, stay strong. I'm seriously wishing the best for you.",1347184039

But surely a car wash is not qualified to act as an actuary (if it was it should immediately shut down all operations and do acturial consulting work instead).  So a car wash company isn't faced with a ""probability"" of a car being damaged - it's faced with a ""price"" for being insured.<p>Clearly if the amount of the coverage (again, in this artificial scenario) is less than you can ""fix"" a Ferrari for, then perhaps they should turn Ferrari's away if they are very risk-averse.  (again, all this is in the artificial model.)<p>But if the insurance-company says, ""We can increase your coverage to (cost of fixing the ferrari) for a difference of (difference)"" then the only way they can possibly pay that difference is by lowering their margins on every car wash, or by discriminating and factoring that difference only into the appropriate washes.<p>all this is more correct than your claim, isn't it? (again, in the proposed model.)<p>incidentally, I consider the proposed model to be extremely braindead.  A car wash is not actually going to pay for any damage, and if it did it certainly would never actually pay for a museum-quality paint job, and if it DID then the price would not be ten bucks per car wash, a shop that can afford these kinds of lavish customer catering and appeasement would be starting at fifty dollars or something.<p>What actually happens is there is a sign saying they disclaim all responsibility for any damage.  What also actually happens is normal price discrimination.<p>so I think a clever answer to ""Why are you charging me more just because I have a ferrari"" is ""only ferrari owners would care about a small scratch from a CAR WASH, and we don't get many of you, so we have to charge you more to pay for that there sign there (point to large disclaimer sign.)

I think that's the wrong way to choose a platform. Are you good in Ruby? Then use RoR. Are you good in JS? Then use node.js.
Maybe RoR is a much better platform than node.js, maybe it's not. But I finished writing my framework/application 10 times, before you even typed RoR. :D
Furthermore: You. Don't. Use. node.js. For. CPU heavy. tasks! Don't do it.
For everything else I think it's a wonderful framework, if you want to write something I/O heavy.<p>btw: The strict asynchronous programming style, using JSs closures, is pretty much the same thing you would write in C (except for that you don't have closures).

If one side flubs an explanation of prior art or of some other term of art, the rest of the jury may be confused or be under a misapprehension and the patent attorney will not be. You'd have to be both unusually self aware and a saint to i) recognize the misapprehension you would be under in that situation if you didn't have domain knowledge, and ii) try to reach a decision as if you were under that misapprehension.<p>In other words, I think it's a complete fiction to tell people to set aside professional training and the knowledge and background that comes with that when they're acting as a jury member.

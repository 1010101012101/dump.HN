He didn&#x27;t have a &quot;world of asylum options&quot; at all, realistically very few countries could resist US pressure to extradite him, China and Russia being the top two.<p>And he gives China a huge reason not to extradite him - reciprocity for the US granting asylum to Chinese dissidents, and further the ability to use his case to advance their argument that the US government is being hypocritical when it criticizes China for all manner of things, from civil rights violations to cyberespionage.<p>He is a <i>huge</i> political coupe for the Chinese government, that just sort of fell into their hands, and as the Xinhua article supporting asylum for Snowden shows, they are going to milk it for all it&#x27;s worth.<p>He&#x27;s playing a dangerous game, and there are no guarantees anywhere for him, but I&#x27;m pretty certain he put himself in the best possible place with the best possible odds.

5886111,comment,5883096,5885244,1,0,jholman,,,"Well, these are much more interesting links than your last round.<p>So, if your car has been stolen, and also you have evidence that 100 other cars have been stolen by the same crook, and then you report it to the police, and I go ask the police for comment about your car, and they say &quot;we can&#x27;t discuss that with you, jholman&quot;, does that mean that you have a secret relationship with police?  I say no.  I think the Google/NSA thing that Wired is refering to is <i>very probably</i> the same type of thing.  The NSA are the cops you would go to, if the crook was another entire country.  The secrecy the court upheld, reported in your link, was not whether or not Google went to the cops, but whether or not the cops investigated the thing Google asked them to.<p>&quot;If there was nothing to hide, why do they try to hide it?&quot;  I agree, and it looks like Google agrees, but the NSA is crazy.  The reason we should think that Google agrees is because Google campaigns to increase transparency, arguing that although national security is important, hiding the numbers of NSLs or FISA orders does not improve security, it just makes abuses possible.<p>Almost everybody in the valley is related to In-Q-Tel, emphatically including YCombinator.  So, yeah, you&#x27;re right about the facts on that one.  I dunno what to make of it.  DARPA funded the internet, too.  TOR was designed originally by the Navy.  Maybe it&#x27;s all okay?  Maybe we should be worried?  It&#x27;s really not clear.  If you want more facts for your conspiracy-theory fire, there was an HN link a day or two ago to a Paul Carr article at Pandodaily, responding to a rant by Arrington.  (I think Arrington&#x27;s piece is fucking retarded, personally, but I bet you&#x27;ll love it.  And I think Carr takes at face value too many of the rumours.)  But Carr DOES have some juicy facts about relationships between the intel community and Silicon Valley.  I don&#x27;t draw the same conclusions that you draw, but it&#x27;s good to have the same facts on the table.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything new to be said about the Wifi/Maps thing.  If it was a mistake, as Google alleges, it was obviously an embarrassing one.  No one can prove whether it was a mistake or deliberate, though.  There&#x27;s lots of evidence that if Google didn&#x27;t lie-a-lot then Google was basically not being super-naughty... but if Google was in bed with the NSA then they would have lied really really a lot, and so all that evidence is probably worth nothing.<p>I think that if you look at the history of NSA collaborators, like the telcos, you will NOT find calls for transparency.  The denials, yeah, I mean... no denial would convince you, and I guess that&#x27;s fair.  But why don&#x27;t you apply the same standard of doubt to everyone else, too?  Remember that there is basically no evidence that Google has participated in any illegal surveillance, nor any widespread surveillance (legal or otherwise), except for some really vague allegation in five powerpoint slides, where those powerpoint slides ALSO make claims that are obviously false (like claiming you accomplish this amazing panopticon for $20M, which is hilarous).<p>Btw, on a completely irrelevant side-note, I don&#x27;t think &quot;dissemination&quot; means what you think it means.",1371326245

5886086,comment,5885941,5885941,17,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"Interesting comparison. A couple of points:<p>1. Fortran code being 2x slower than anything for array operations means you&#x27;re not using Fortran right. So this result says more about f2py generating bad Fortran code than anything else. Labeling that as &quot;Fortran&quot; is disingenuous  it should be labeled &quot;f2py&quot;.<p>2. I&#x27;m surprised that SciPy and Scikit aren&#x27;t faster than this. You can use clever techniques to compute pairwise distances asymptotically faster than the nave loop approach. For example, see the Julia Distance.jl package [1], which gets a 125x speedup [2] over a nave loop implementation for computing pairwise Euclidian distances. I haven&#x27;t done a direct comparison but for simple scalar loops like this, Julia has C-speed, which means its nave version would be about the same as Numba and Cython and the Distance.jl version would be correspondingly faster. Of course, the amount of speedup depends on the shape of the matrices, so 125x speedup might not happen in this particular case.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/lindahua/Distance.jl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lindahua/Distance.jl</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/lindahua/Distance.jl#pairwise-benchmark"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lindahua/Distance.jl#pairwise-benchmark</a>",1371325620

Some of these reasons are selfish, and some are completely altruistic. Many are both selfish and altruistic- one could easily argue that the FSF falls into that category, not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that.<p>The whole point of creating Open Source was to acknowledge that. The GNU philosophy is very, very, very specific in its means and goals and presents a very specific worldview, and plenty of people (maybe even the majority?) who are interested sharing code don&#x27;t agree with much of it.<p>You state that Open Source was created &quot;to keep the code sharing parts while shedding the ethical positions of the GNU philosophy&quot;, and many of the people who were instrumental in creating the concept would agree with you. But the reason the concept has stuck around has nothing to do with that. It&#x27;s just a very, very useful concept. It&#x27;s very handy to have some way to refer to software for which source code is available, redistributable, and reuseable, and not instantly imply all of the metric ton of legal or philosophical baggage associated with FSF-approved projects.<p>Someone who doesn&#x27;t agree with the ethical portions of the GNU philosophy isn&#x27;t unethical, they just have a different point of view. Yet, that&#x27;s what you imply in your phrasing. Tons of people who contribute greatly to Open Source (or even Free Software!) consider certain elements of the GNU philosophy to be unethical. This whole &quot;with us or against us&quot; attitude is what turns off so many people to the FSF and RMS in the first place. It&#x27;s like PETA saying that you are either 100% on board with them and everything they do, or you are in favor of murdering puppies, and there&#x27;s no middle ground or room for more nuanced perspectives or alternative philosophies.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing against the GNU philosophy; I agree with much of it and strongly disagree with some other parts of it. As always, I&#x27;m just strongly in favor of a world where people think for themselves, come to their own conclusions, cooperate with others when they have overlapping goals, and don&#x27;t go out of their way to continually villainize people who aren&#x27;t 100% on board with every single line item in one guy&#x27;s personal doctrine.",1371324706

I owned a TRS-80 in the late 1980s, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that my inability to run Apple II software on it could not be accurately blamed on hardware-based copy protection. The Mac is not a dongle for OS X any more than OS X is a dongle for Cocoa software. Or are we seriously going to argue that it&#x27;s harmful for consumers if we can&#x27;t run all applications on all platforms, and that the differentiation should only be a matter of aesthetics? (Which, all platforms followed Freedom Zero, would be easily changeable anyway, right?)<p>The thing I&#x27;d really like to see more focus on is <i>data freedom.</i> Maybe what I&#x27;m using to read ebooks, play music, watch videos, create word processing documents and spreadsheets, write code, and edit photos in is open source, maybe it isn&#x27;t -- but switching to something <i>else</i> to do those things in shouldn&#x27;t require me to lose fidelity/functionality in a conversion process, let alone require me to either re-buy something due to DRM (or crack the DRM). Yes, if I had the freedom <i>and the ability</i> to modify every application on every platform, I would theoretically have complete data freedom -- but I should be able to have that even if I&#x27;m using 100% closed source software.",1371323552

5885965,comment,5885251,5885251,14,0,dylangs1030,,,"I love this post intellectually, but I believe it has a fairly simple answer - convenience and design. @patio11 also discussed these on his blog[1], which I&#x27;ll get into:<p>Most people (users/customers) don&#x27;t give a crap about freedom zero because most people <i>aren&#x27;t hackers.</i> Most people want things to &quot;just work.&quot; Most people don&#x27;t want to tinker and screw around hunched in front of a lit screen for a few hours just to set up their drivers in a specific way.<p>On the other side, most employees don&#x27;t care about perpetuating freedom zero or that philosophy because it&#x27;s not as rewarding. I mean, yeah, it feels good to have open source projects and contribute to the community. But let&#x27;s be honest, it doesn&#x27;t pay the bills as well as working at, say, Microsoft does. Proprietary software attracts the more highly skilled engineers (<i>usually</i> - obviously some people are possessed of such personal conviction in software freedom that they will give up high salaries for their hacker community, but this is  not the norm).<p>Here&#x27;s a few examples to illustrate my point:<p>My mother is barely computer literate. If I presented her with Banshee instead of iTunes, she&#x27;d freak out. It would either gray out, become non-responsive, and subsequently close on her while syncing, or she wouldn&#x27;t have all the features that a coordinated group of engineers in a multinational company built and designed for mass production.<p>As a programmer, I&#x27;m the same way. I want things to just work. Just because I know how to do things most other people don&#x27;t using a computer doesn&#x27;t automatically mean I&#x27;m invested in the free software movement. I dual-boot linux on my Mac, but I only use it for technical reasons. I don&#x27;t honestly believe it&#x27;s applicable or relevant to most people&#x27;s uses of a computer. It doesn&#x27;t &quot;just work&quot; <i>a lot of the time</i> - enough for it to be annoying. There&#x27;s a &quot;feel good&quot; euphoria that occurs in an intellectually superior sort of way when you install linux, but it quickly drops off when it&#x27;s a hassle just to get YouTube videos to play properly.<p>Secondly, and <i>just as importantly</i> - design. Do rhythmbox or banshee have as <i>sexy</i> a design as iTunes? Could they, with the resources they have? No, and no. Sure, they have accomplished something impressive, and in some respects, they have higher utility than iTunes. But overall, it&#x27;s not an attractive interface. As Dave Wiskus would say, it isn&#x27;t <i>relevant</i> and it doesn&#x27;t <i>match</i> - a program needs to look like it <i>belongs</i> in the system it&#x27;s designed under in order for it to be liked by a user many times. This doesn&#x27;t just mean that software has to look like Windows or Mac, but that it has to <i>understand</i> the user and take out cumbersome decisions while preserving features in a way that is <i>similarly intuitive to the system it resides in</i> - that&#x27;s very hard. It&#x27;s also why UI and UX designers are as well paid as programmers.<p>We see this with apps all the time. When an app doesn&#x27;t look like it matches the sleekness of iPhone&#x27;s design i.e. it&#x27;s clunky or looks &quot;themed&quot; with no custom overhead, it has a verifiable impact on the marketability of the app. The same applies to software. patio11&#x27;s Bingo Card Creator competes with open source by being <i>better</i> because he has higher motivation. It&#x27;s <i>easier</i> to obtain proprietary software (read: not cheaper, easier) because there&#x27;s no hierarchy of betas and alphas and complicated names. There&#x27;s a simple &quot;download&quot; or &quot;install&quot; button. The design has full teams of people behind it, knowing which hundred things to take out for which one thing to keep. Open source can&#x27;t afford that.<p>This is why freedom zero isn&#x27;t popular. I love free software, and I have a good advantage over &quot;normal&quot; (non-technical) users in utilizing it, but it&#x27;s just not practical if you desire convenience <i>and</i> utility.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/03/07/how-to-successfully-compete-with-open-source-software/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/03/07/how-to-successfully-comp...</a>",1371323077

5885959,comment,5885313,5885854,2,0,davidcuddeback,,,"Reminds me of the populists who tried to enact change in ancient Rome. One of them would call for reform and end up murdered. The next one would find protection before calling for reform, but ended up murdered anyway. Each successive would-be reformer learned from the mistakes of his predecessors and changed his strategy accordingly. A couple of the reformers whose names I can remember are Tiberius Gracchus [1] and his brother Gaius Gracchus [2]. One of my favorite podcasts has an excellent six-part series on the fall of the western Roman empire, which introduced me to this very topic [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Gracchus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Gracchus</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.dancarlin.com//disp.php?page=hharchive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dancarlin.com//disp.php?page=hharchive</a>",1371323017

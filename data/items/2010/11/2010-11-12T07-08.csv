What do you tell a young girl who's in a similar situation? ""Punch her in the nose?"" ...""</i><p>The asymmetry of this situation is not described much here because the type of bullying attacks used by females are less physical. The mechanics are similar but the techniques are different and can be summarised thus: <i>""Males are paratroopers, females are secret agents""</i>. Males rely more on aggression and physicality and are overt while females specailise in covert relational and psychological bullying.

There's a very good point to be made that a university should be a place where people of different backgrounds and cultures can come together in a collective environment. If you have 60% 'Asian students who want to major in math or science and play the violin' that's an issue, just as 60% white business  major lacrosse-players is an issue.<p>I do have to say, one area where I'm concerned is graduate international admission. In my experience the TOEFL is clearly not cutting it with some people and knowing English is not optional as a graduate student -- you NEED to be able to easily communicate with your fellow grads and, perhaps most importantly, the undergrads you TA. Similarly, strong accent should definitely be a factor in choosing who can lecture classes. I don't care how good a researcher someone is if no one can understand them. This isn't even a complaint about Asian students and professors, either. The person I'm thinking of is Brazilian.",1289548623

If your application looks exactly the same as a couple hundred other students, you're going to be compared against them first. A University can't admit only the math/science violinists, they need at least some variety, so you'll be measured against the people similar to you rather than all the applicants.<p>p.s. what is it with violin and piano, anyway? Is it because they are classical (and thus appear refined) yet can solo?",1289548380

This thread largely stinks of people clinging on to this belief, if only for their own sanity. It's no secret that the HN crowd holds itself in high regard intellectually and it would be damning to believe otherwise, as all of a sudden you wouldn't have a shot at being the next Bill Gates or the next Linus Torvalds or whoever it is you worship, on the basis of your hard work alone.<p>This ideal is highly romanticized and is part of our education problem. We strongly belief EVERYONE should go to college, and EVERYONE is equal, when in reality, some people would be better suited to work with their hands as a mechanic than some paper pusher at an insurance company.<p>In Europe, they are more slanted towards the nature point of view, and this is reflected in their vocational training in education - ie, everyone isn't born equal, everyone doesn't have to follow the exact same path for the sake of appeasing some romantic ideal that we can't prove true either way.<p>While the truth is probably somewhere in the middle, it's plain foolish to ignore that some people are just born with an innate talent. If you played sports, it would be easier for people to wrap their head around this - a 5'5 basketball player will never play starting center in the NBA. It's just the way it is.<p>It is part of your responsibility as a human being to find out what those things are that you are most gifted at and exploit them to their maximum potential.",1289546153

I use an older version of this engine in my work and never really bought into actively hating Smarty, although I stopped using it for my own projects.<p>One of the core arguments against it, I think, was PHP developers suddenly remembering short tags and alternative syntaxes for control structures (if, foreach) that made working with templates in straight PHP just as easy, much more flexible, and shaving a few milliseconds off load times -- it's a sizeable library to load.",1289545986

There are only 32 NFL teams. Even among those few that make it (probably much smaller than 1% I'd wager), few are superstars. Taking into account chance of injury, short career, and brain damage (in this case), the ~ $700K NFL salary isn't so great.<p>And musicians? Their situation is probably worse! The truth is talent is pretty bountiful. Finding out that no matter what hot shit you were in high school, there's an army of kids out there ten times smarter is a veritable right of passage. Maybe this guy is the top .01%, but I think the value you can extract from the relative brilliance of one member is a case of diminishing returns.

He urges you wait for a provocation, and then to attack them with your fists, in public, and suffer the quasi-legal consequences in return for the social standing it provides.<p>I don't like this advice, because I don't want to ever be forced to play this game.   If you threaten my physical safety, I'm either going to ignore you and move along, give in and go the police afterward, or I'm going to kill you.  Not figuratively; there is no game.  I hope to never get to that point, but there is no chance that I'd try to beat an aggressor with my fists fair-and-square.

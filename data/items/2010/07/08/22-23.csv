1499047,comment,1498889,1498936,0,0,igravious,,,"The Chomsky review (which apparently devastated Skinner's behaviourism) is mentioned in the first few paragraphs because the author of the review, Peter Godfrey-Smith, claims that similarities between behaviouralism and Darwinism have been pointed out. In the second last paragraph of this long review he says:<p>""The similarities between behaviourist learning theory and Darwinian evolutionary theory are not as close as Skinner or, now, Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini claim, even if the theories have structural resemblances. Behaviourist learning theory, as applied to humans, has been largely abandoned, but that doesn’t mean that Darwinism’s theory asks to be abandoned along with it. Still, if one view is right and the other wrong, we might try to say something about why a certain pattern of explanation works in one place and not in the other.""<p>Chomsky's review is not the focus of the piece but it is bound up in the back and forth of ideas under the microscope here. You are correct though, the title of the submission is misleading.<p>I found the arguments very hard to follow even though I am pretty well read up on the mechanics of the theory of evolution and even though I have some philosophical training. This is one of those instances where I'd need to read the book I guess. I'm not sure if it is Godfrey-Smith's fault for not explaining Fodor's and Piattelli-Palmarini's position well or whether their position is unsellable. Seemed very hair-splitting to me.",1278629494

1499042,comment,1498442,1498910,0,0,jessriedel,,,"These were exactly my thoughts when I read this piece.  I don't understand how anyone could be confused.  News organizations don't claim that it's better <i>for society</i> that they hide their biases; they claim it's better for the status of the news organization.  I mean, it's right in the quote from the Washington Post:<p>> ""..could be perceived as reflecting political racial, sexist, religious or other bias or favoritism that could be used to tarnish our journalistic credibility.”<p>Likewise, in the conversation that Arrington mentions, the reporter never says that it his motivations for keeping his views secret are for the public good.<p>However, <i>none</i> of this suggests, as Arrington argues, that there should be more opinions in our news.  Rather, reporters should (for the public good) strive to make their writing as opinion- and bias-free as possible <i>while</i> simultaneously being up front about their personal biases and political persuasions.",1278629319

The recipe for ""news"" at the NYT is an exhausting example of this:<p>""Some decision was made.  Someone important said it was good b/c of A but others say it is bad b/c of B.  10 years ago when a similar decision was made, A was the result.  But on the other hand it is very hard to measure B, and it's effects can be mitigated by C.  An expert acknowledged the risk of B but said that the benefits of A made it worth it.""<p>Usually the reporter's actual opinion was whatever side he gave the last word.  In this case A.

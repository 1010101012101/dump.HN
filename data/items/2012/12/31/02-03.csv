I've developed web-based user interfaces for several projects in recent years, some of them with a strong mobile focus. I'm still waiting for all these demons to come and bite us, where our paying customers don't find the experience satisfactory and run away to the competitors who are going to beat us by having a highly polished native app instead.<p>Sure, there are occasional irritations with mobile browsers. Many of them, perhaps even the majority I've come across, are actually by design because Apple actively chose not to make their browser work like everyone else's... again. But do we spend as much effort getting our web apps to run effectively across all the major platforms (including Windows) as we'd have to spend writing a native UI on every platform we want to support? Not even close.<p>And native apps still have the same horrible downsides as ever: the app store approval lottery, Apple wanting a huge cut of any money you make, yada yada.<p>If I were running Facebook, where for practical purposes the budget and developer time required to develop a mobile app on every platform were negligible, sure, maybe it's worth it for a more polished experience. (Maybe.) But for more modest projects, where resources are finite and we don't magically have developers on tap who speak a different ""native"" language for each platform, I can spend the time and money once to build the web app and then the same again refining it or I can spend the time and money twice just to get the basics done without any polish. I don't understand how anyone who has actually done this can be in any doubt about which gets better results.",1356922789

This seems to work in Python:<p><pre><code>    s = ""Hello""\n    up = True\n    (s.upper if up else s.lower)()\n</code></pre>\nNot that it's a very pythonic piece of code, but it works, and i would expect many other languages support something similar.<p>Anyway, that's tangential.

4988152,comment,4985853,4987503,4,0,gruseom,,,"My main work is on a complex application, but we write it in Parenscript, a Lisp that compiles to Javascript (so yes, I do like languages like Clojurescript). That gives us escape hatches for controlling complexity that raw Javascript doesn't have. On the other hand, I do still write some raw Javascript and I prefer the same style in both. As far as I can tell from various measurements, the Lisp I write is about half the size of what I would write in JS. That's a win, but not so big that it can be the only strategy for limiting complexity.<p>Do I come from a functional programming background? Not really. I use closures and lambdas a lot, but my code is rather imperative. My obsession when building systems is to keep the code as simple and small as I reasonably can. Mutable state and even global state don't scare me as long as they help with that. What scares me are architectural assumptions about how one ""should"" structure complex software.<p>This sort of thing is a bazillion times more fun to discuss in person, whilst drinking beer, than it is in the contactless format in which we find ourselves. I'd try to convince you that you might do well to drop your OO assumptions, but I'm afraid of coming across as shrill. There isn't enough context here to make one's claims nuancedly enough, and then also ""nuancedly"" is not a word.",1356922614

As much as is possible, you should strive to minimize your dependence on any single company (at least until you have some clout), and having a code base that is locked to a closed platform breaks that principle.<p>And look, what I'm saying here isn't ideologically motivated.

4988142,comment,4987795,4987795,2,0,jefflinwood,,,"Some of the impetus towards cross platform HTML5 development was probably because the state of Android app design in the 2.x era was so bad. You could basically get away with using an iOS-look-alike web toolkit on Android in a WebView, and it was ""good enough"".<p>With Ice Cream Sandwich, the new Holo look and feel actually has a real design language that is markedly different from an iOS app.<p>As to Windows Phone - there is such a strong design for Windows Phone apps that those jQuery Mobile apps in their app store look really out of place. Microsoft's working on some CSS that will make jQuery Mobile apps look more native, but it's still missing some of the key Windows Phone UI like panorama.<p>From developing HTML5 and native mobile apps for iOS and Android, and from follow ups on some mobile application strategy consults, HTML5 mobile apps just don't deliver a good user experience, especially if the app does anything other than content consumption.",1356922400
4988141,comment,4987795,4988083,1,0,jspthrowaway2,,,"Fine, I'll bite.<p>Assuming you're belittling Objective-C, let's not forget that Objective-C is simply C with Smalltalk bolted on. I'm having a hard time imagining a plane of reality in which either is not ""half decent"". Objective-C is, in my opinion, much better than C++ to accomplish the same task (they have semi-equivalent aims, though implemented very, <i>very</i> differently).<p>I learned Objective-C and iOS (then called iPhone OS) from scratch to write a quite-complex app once. The app has been in the store for two years now. Like you, initially, I balked at the brackets; everybody does. Eventually, I was actually pleased that my C experience carried over so well, and it was a pleasant experience in the end. As you do, I wrote two to throw away until I mastered the platform, and I didn't mind it at all.<p>Assuming your object <i>user</i> has an <i>update</i> method which takes a <i>name</i> argument and you want to store the result of  calling <i>update</i> somewhere, here's Python vs. Objective-C (the Smalltalk-influenced terminology is different, but the concepts are the same):<p><pre><code>    save_result(user.update(name=""Larry""))\n\n    saveResult([user updateWithName:""Larry""]);\n</code></pre>\nI don't find one much more horrible than the other.",1356922360

4988137,comment,4987737,4987737,36,0,ChuckMcM,,,"As an operations guy I find this really interesting. What I find interesting is the cost vs revenue of these games.<p>Obviously to me there is a bunch of up front costs, art assets, game play design, etc. But once you've got the basic HTML5 code going, and the art assets in place, what are your on-going costs?<p>Clearly there is going to be bandwidth at scale its like $2 - $3 per megabit per month, you've got power/cooling in a colo, so that's going to cost you maybe $3K/month for a 42U rack's worth of servers. And presumably you've got a couple of opsen types tending and feeding that rack. But they are split across say 100 racks so 1/100th of their salary/benefits per month, lets call it $160/month [1]. So lets give the game 500Mbits of bandwidth a month (that is 4.3TB of data transfer per day) We can put 20 beefy servers in our 42U rack with 20TB of disk space and 1/2TB of flash in each (we do this at Blekko)So 400TB of disk space and 10TB of flash, and if you wanted 3.8TB of RAM (192GB/server) and 480 threads of execution.<p>Now I'm making a huge assumption here, and so I'm calling it out, but my assumption is that the ""game"" is essentially a front end on a database, where player actions become database transactions, and those transactions show up as changes in the game 'world', further those transactions are both shared (everyone in the game can see them) and private (only you see the changes). So a system that is slightly less beefy than our setup (the Sun setup) gets 10M transactions/minute in the TPC-C benchmark [2]. At that level it suggest our stack-o-servers might support 1 - 2M players.<p>So our monthly cost is on the order of $6,500 and we're hosting say 1.5M players. That means we need to extract something like a half cent per month out of those players in order to pay for running the hardware. For a gross margin of 50% that is about .86 cents.<p>I may be completely off here somewhere, please point out my math or configuration errors! It seems like one could essentially run a game 'forever' until that average number got too low and then you would have to wind it down, but one wonders about how hard it is get get someone to pay a penny a month.<p>I did leave out the maintenance (warranty) cost of the servers, a recent quote from a server vendor had 'everything covered, onsite tech' for $175/server/month. So if you wanted to add that in then there would be another $3,500/month to cover.<p>It looks like a license to print money but clearly there is something here that sucks all that money away. Curious what it is.<p>[1] That is two ops people with a combined salary/benefit package costing $200K/year or 16K/month which divided by 100 (1/100th of their work) is $160.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/results/tpcc_perf_results.asp?resulttype=cluster&amp;version=5%&amp;currencyID=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/results/tpcc_perf_results.asp?result...</a>",1356922265

Javascript bridges to native functionality are messy and can fail. And for what? Writing one code base? How much client-side logic are you really doing that you don't want to replicate?<p>Any mobile app I write that requires server logic is basically just a view, so it needs to accept and manipulate JSON. Interface Builder gets you an interface in minutes (of course, you can spend time tweaking it), and there are dozens of networking libraries that consume a service and spit out native objects (if that's your thing).

I think the information you have applies only to options on publicly-traded stock because the value of stock that is not publicly traded is sufficiently hard to determine to prevent it from becoming a routine or traditional part of an employee's compensation package.  One way to value a non-traded stock is to use the valuation used in investments, but there are not enough investment events for the phrase ""the value of the stock the day you start"" to make sense -- especially when you take into account that the terms of many investments are never published (with the result that the employee would need to take the startup's word on the terms).<p>That's how I conclude that the information you give in great grandparent does not apply in the current situation :)",1356921561

People do strange things for love. Does it always make economic sense? No.<p>What is the transaction cost of forcing your kids to leave school and boy/girlfriends if the job change requires moving? What is the transaction cost of asking your husband to quit his job and leave the church where he's been a deacon for the last 10 years? I once talked with someone who loves the sea, and couldn't think of leaving away from it. What's the transaction cost, were she your wife, to move her to a better paying job in Oklahoma? Does that include the costs of divorce, should she find that she loves the sea more than you?<p>What is the economic cost of being considered a ""failure"" and a ""quitter"", or ""not a team player"" by your neighbors and ex-coworkers? Of being disowned by your family for switching from Jehovah's Witness to Southern Baptist? Of being the sole outspoken atheist in a small Bible Belt town?<p>These can be estimated, certainly, but those estimates feel like post hoc parameter fitting. ""If person X won't switch to another job which pays $3k more, then the price on staying is worth at least $3k."" With enough parameters you can fit anything.<p>Can you tell how the various economic models include these factors into the cost model? How do they estimate these various costs I've outlined?<p>Going into semi-obscure New Mexico history, in the 1950s the 82-year-old John Prather was offered $200,000 for his mule ranch in southern NM, so that White Sands Missile Range could be expanded. The price was well above the going rate for the land, but he was the last hold-out. He was one of the last of the US pioneers to the American West, and he wasn't going to leave. Period. He would rather die in a gunfight than move.<p>Americans liked the romantic idea of one of the last pioneers still living the old ways, which put pressure on the Army and the police to not force the issue. They gave up, and Prather stayed there until he died.<p>What would you say is the transaction cost for him to move? Obviously staying there was worth more than $200,000 to him. Was it $5,000,000? Was there any amount of sum which would have gotten him to move? If no such number exists, then can you even use an economic model for this event?<p>BTW, in our other thread I asked this of you: do monopolies (or cartels, for that matter) ever abuse their monopoly (or oligopoly) powers? If so, do you use moral guidelines to determine what constitutes abuse?",1356919682

There were numerous times where I would queue up a bunch of work in the game, only to get a message saying that ""Farmville has been enhanced, please refresh to continue"".  Refreshing the page would mean I have to click on all those trees again.  Every time you load the game you need to close about 5 promotional offers attempting to get you to buy farm cash, or invite your friends to play the game.  The game employs emotionally manipulative tactics to get people to use farm cash (in game currency you pay for).  Every once in a while you will get a pop up with a picture of a sad horse which needs shelter.  It will run away if you don't feed him now!  There are also a lot of annoying promotions that pop up and you are not given the option dismiss them.  The only button provided is ""Start now"" or ""Tell me more..."".  The game if full of bugs, and occasionally has pop up windows that have no text and empty buttons.

If you're just weighing the cost/benefit with respect to one particular incident, it's quite clear that the benefit one person gets from sneaking into a concert far outweighs the very marginal cost to the owner of any potential liability, trampling on grass, whatever. The latter can probably be measured in cents.<p>> Now, a business that doesn't make any profit is a difficult business to operate, but I'm not sure that it's morally wrong to pay for the marginal cost of production.<p>So you're saying that there is nothing morally questionable about taking a Coach bag and leaving an amount of money equal to the marginal production cost + restocking cost of that bag?

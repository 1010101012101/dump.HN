Every single actual gui OS feature I have used is terrible and skin deep.<p>Having a terrible gui and slapping a linux console on it is not the same as having a real visual OS.  Yes having a linux console is wonderful, but it is not an excuse for how completely lacking in features the actual visual interface is.  You know, the part Apple is responsible for.<p>What I mean by skin deep is that it works well for a consumer that isn't very computer literate really and just wants to write documents and use the internet, but if you try to do something deeper than that you basically discover that you can't or it is terrible.<p>Finder is awful across the board.  Yes you can get a replacement, but what the hell is a gui operating system for if not looking at files in the file tree.  I could go into detail about why it is awful but if you have used it than you really already know.  I don't think windows 7 is the greatest os or has a perfect file explorer, but it is crazy how much better it is than the one in osx.<p>Outputting to multiple monitors and the management of the output is terrible.  Currently my understanding is that you basically have to go into the linux console to have any control over it.(Like turning off your laptop monitor, or any kind of management of the individual monitors past which one is located on the right)<p>Apple seems to not give a fuck about backwards compatibility across ios and osx.  If you have an older mac(not even very old really, less than 4-5 years) and you want to update the OS to the newest one the device can handle, which is an OSX version before mountain lion; for some reason the only way to do this is to call apple on the phone and read them your credit card info so they can ship it to you which will take weeks.  Even though they used to be available in the app store and the physical store.  Literally the day Mountain Lion came out they basically discontinued any distribution of Lion outside of this crazy calling apple method.  Also new SDKs for ios break code in undocumented ways including in features that Apple provides(like the video controller).  The simulator can give wildly different output than the actual devices and each iteration of the ipad/iphone can give its own different output on the same code.  This can and often is App breaking stuff.<p>XCode is much worse than Visual Studio in too many ways to list.  Even having something basic like tabs for different files is terrible, also the vi plugin for it is not good.  Also imo obj-c is a pretty unpleasant language but that is trivial.<p>I don't love windows or microsoft at all, but apple does not cater to developers in any way.  Even the way they deal with developers being in their little ecosystems is very different.  Microsoft XBLIG/WP/Win 8 sign up and publishing system is no cake walk but it is orders of magnitude better than how Apple treats us.<p>Apple makes great hardware, beautiful amazing hardware.  However their software is really awful and basically only caters to consumers, and really unsophisticated ones at that.(Note: Apple did not make linux, any features of OSX you are using from a console is really not something Apple is responsible for.  Apple is responsible for the gui, xcode, itunes, ios, and any other little app they made that comes with osx)",1352806465

4777390,comment,4773299,4773693,1,0,chii,,,"But whats the ""cause"" of the problem?<p>I posit that the very root cause, is that a group of stakeholders who don't know any better, fails to trust the person who _do_ know better.<p>Now, the stakeholder might have good reason to not place their trust in people actually building the system to build it properly (for instance, he/she might be a middle manager and reports to the boss/CEO, but is responsible for the failure of the project, but isn't responsible for its success). The stakeholder might attempt to place complex requirements because they think that they know it is required for the success. In other words, an attempt at somehow guarenteeing that the failure of their subordinates don't lead to their own failure. If everyone up and down the chain uses this method to conduct their business, it would lead to complex systems (and not just software systems, but also business systems - example, all these bureaucracy and paper work to get things to ""sign off"" and processed, and approval etc).<p>I propose a radical solution that might perhaps alleviate this problem (at least for software systems). The current structure of organization in companies tend to be heirachical, and this sort of structure will inevitalbly form the problem described above. So, to solve the problem, you could try a non-heirachical organization, or a very, very flat organization, where theres really only 1 level from the ""worker"" (someone who actually does the output) to the boss (who owns the joint). The worker's vested interest lies in the success of the project, for the payment structure has ties to the success of the project. For example, each worker is given time to ""invest"" in an array of projects that is needed. If the project succeeds, their contribution counts the same way equity would count for a startup.<p>There are no ""middle managers"" whose entire purpose is to summarize the progress and status for upper managers, who do more summarization and report to the boss (who may or may not understand those summaries since they are now far removed from the actual work). Instead, your project is run like a startup - you got a limited budget, you got to ship or die.<p>I'd  like to see something run like this in the real world. Of course, i haven't fleshed out a lot of details...and there lies the devil",1352805084

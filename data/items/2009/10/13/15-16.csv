Indeed, if (i) the fees are reasonable/de minimis and are adequately disclosed and (ii) the angel group is providing a legitimate service to entrepreneurs, there may be compelling reasons to support such a fee-based service.  That’s why I have strongly recommended in a recent blog post (see <a href=""http://bit.ly/hAYeu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/hAYeu</a>) that Jason Calacanis and John Dilts (the founder and President of Maverick Angels, LLC and an attorney) meet face-to-face and have a live debate (in the great American tradition), which can be shown on the web to all interested parties via ustream.

But people who claim to be lucky or unlucky are much more common than that.<p>The next question you'd have to address is whether the people who claim to be ""lucky"" or ""unlucky"" actually seem to be experiencing more-than-chance proportions of good or bad life events, of a sort we would otherwise think of as exogenous (like falling down stairs) or partially randomness-based (like meeting a new girlfriend in a crowd).  There would be a large problem of biased reporting at this point.<p>If so, then because we know luck doesn't <i>really</i> exist, we should indeed look for hidden internal characteristics to explain these runs of good or bad luck.  As the saying goes, ""YOU are the only common denominator in all your failed relationships.""<p>Trying to train people to be lucky was an interesting attempt at experimental manipulation, but it's hard to untangle from the ""biased reporting"" hypothesis - you may just be making people think they're lucky.  Still a good thing to test, though.  (Possible stronger test:  Train people to be ""lucky in love"" (that's what you tell them you're doing) and see if they become luckier in other areas too.)",1255448993

You will need to get a few books on CSS, clean HTML design, and a decent javascript library. JQuery is trivial to learn and its jquery-UI library will abstract a good chunk of the difficulty, but you still have to understand how everything works underneath.<p>If you don't get the web, you might be better off playing with HTTP as a protocol. Writing a screen-scrapper for various sites and dealing with cookies, hidden forms, authentication and similar, using Perl LWP, will teach you more about HTTP than any book, though you can keep HTTP The Definitive Guide nearby.<p>You will need to <i>grok</i> HTML, get the oreilly HTML the Definitive Guide as well.<p>CSS? CSS The Difinitive Guide.<p>JavaScript? Get the Rhino book, JavaScript the Definitive Guide .. see a pattern yet?<p>The definitive guides on HTTP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the heavy tomes you will need on your desk(top). Nearly every other publication on the subject if frivolous and trendy. Those books are the meat; they're essentially guides to the specs themselves. You're C and C++ programmer, you will appreciate this stuff.<p>After that, get every book you can find on CSS. Buttons, menus are made with CSS and images. Buttons could be made with the <button> tag, but not always, there are also image buttons, along with ""standard"" button built into HTML forms (i.e. submit and reset.) Menus are made with lists, tabbed menus could be made with pure HTML but they are a pain, so some people use javascript for that.<p>The most important thing you will need to understand is the DOM. The DOM is what ties HTML, CSS and JavaScript together. The Rhino book actually covers all this ground.<p>Sessions tie a few loose ends together; you will learn a lot about POST and GET methods of HTTP trying to implement a shopping cart, for example. How do you persist user's shopping cart? does state stay on the server or does it go on the client side? Do you use cookie, session-side variable, do you rewrite URLs to encode the cart contents or do you put them in a hidden form input client side?<p>You wont be jumping into buttons and menus straight away; not if you want to understand <i>everything</i>. Play with web crawlers, learn to tweak websites with GreaseMonkye, get Firebug and have it open while you read the books, get the Tamper Data plugin for firefox and see what is being sent and back forth, get the YSlow plugin, etc. These tools will not help you learn all this stuff, but they allow you to peek into websites and show you how things are done. I use ColorZilla to copy nice color schemes from websites. The Firebug element inspector will highlight any screen element and show you how it's been coded in HTML, you can also inspect the CSS design and the javascript that makes it all alive. I learned most of this stuff by reverse engineering.<p>Welcome to hell my friend, it's gonna be fun.",1255447473

If the idea is to solely replace the mouse, then you either have to reduce the size and therefore reduce the accuracy compared to a mouse, and I don't think that's a poor trade-off as it makes many tasks harder (from painting to even using icons), or move the keyboard into an uncomfortable position, which also isn't a good tradeoff as many tasks are much quicker when you're able to use your keyboard and therefore your muscle memory.<p>I'm also far from convinced by the GUI mock-up.<p>A taskbar or dock isn't visible at all times, and this is huge step backwards. Having to scroll left/right or use a gesture every time to switch applications will get tedious extremely quickly, and there's no flexibility in how you use your windows which may preclude certain tasks. I also think the author overstates the 'sorting through the pile' problem, especially since you generally know where your window is in the taskbar/dock, and various ways to mitigate the issue already exist (most notably Expose and live thumbnails).<p>I also think the 'menu' paradigm is something that OSes should be getting away from, let alone touch-based OSes where a Microsoft-style Ribbon would work wonders, so I can't help but splutter about the idea of a mass of menus hidden away. In addition, their implementation makes worse an OS X-ism, which is hiding menu items before the window is active, only in this case hiding it until you've pressed a magic button. We have big screens and plenty of resolution these days, there's no excuse for hiding things away.",1255446712

They still get a lot of bug reports that are x64 only and don't have resources dedicated to it because Firefox OS and Metro mode have higher priorities.<p>For folks in the bug saying that this will make them somehow abandon Firefox, if 64-bit is really that important to them, they'll have to use Internet Explorer only and deal with many popular plugins not working (Adobe Reader, Quicktime, etc).<p>Opera has an experimental Win64 build from February that is now out of date with known security issues.  No further progress has been made or release schedule announced.<p>Chrome, Chromium and Iron are 32-bit only and have no 64-bit builds, not even pre-alpha experimental ones.<p>Apple has abandoned Safari for Windows entirely.<p>So, as far as 64-bit browsers on Windows... you've got IE and that's it.<p>UPDATE: As correctly pointed out below, there is a snapshot (alpha, incomplete, unstable) build of current Opera for Win x64.

4817679,comment,4816682,4816682,1,0,kintamanimatt,,,"I wonder if these color schemes are chosen primarily because it's what's traditional and expected; we don't like to surprise our users/customers as it may induce negative feelings, including a lack of trust. For example, we expect a fashion website to look different to a web app, and when something is discordant with our preconceived notions we trust it less. I think that typically designers intuitively go for a less-surprising aesthetic rather than an atypical one whose aesthetic induces a degree of trust-eroding cognitive dissonance.<p>The one utilitarian site I can think of that breaks the author's pattern is Wufoo; bold colors, utilitarian purpose. They seem to be quite successful too. Having said that, a single counterexample doesn't diminish the validity of the author's central thesis, but it might just be one notch in the larger key.",1353563793

4817657,comment,4817405,4817604,5,0,gruseom,,,"I agree with your main point, but it's ahistorical to say that if something was wrong then it must not have been scientific. That's a popular and seductive view that manages to commit both the hindsight and no-true-scotsman fallacies. The truth is that science (by which I mean the community of scientific opinion) is often wrong. It's just hard to see this in any given case until enough time has passed.<p>For example, in the 1960s scientists told women not to breast-feed their babies because Science had proven that ""formula"" was better. That could hardly seem stupider or more absurd now, but an entire generation was affected by it. To me, that's a reasonable baseline against which to guard ourselves. It seems arrogant to suppose that we're smarter or less error-prone than the experts of 40 years ago.<p>The conclusion I draw from this is that public policy should be skeptical of scientific opinion  not dismissive of it, of course; that would be silly  but inclined to err on the side of pluralism and non-intervention. That would also be an appropriate use of the word ""skepticism"" as opposed to the dogmatism that calls itself by that name these days. I'm uncomfortable (as your comment suggests you are) with the zealotry of the more aggressive pro-science movements that have arisen in recent years. They speak in the name of science, but emotionally they are proto-religious. Science, the abstraction, does not exist. What exists are communities of fallible and corruptible humans. We need to take that into account, everywhere and deeply.",1353563326

The idea of being able to turn on and off senses at will is kind of an amazing thought. I personally have a hypersensitive sense of touch, and it is an almost constant distraction. I can't count the number of times I've wished I could toggle or perhaps just filter my senses.<p>It's still undoubtedly far off in the wings. I'm not sure if anything has been done on the purely organic side, but I know that at least on the ECE side of things our ability to effectively interact with organic systems is still quite ineffective and brutish. The professor I had for digital signal processing last year does some work with cochlear implants. He spent a lecture talking about the current technologies, and the implantation and interfacing he described was very destructive. There would undoubtedly be severe ability loss if they were used on an otherwise capable person to try to enable this ability. It would be nice if we evolutionary developed some high-pass preprocessing.

4817644,comment,4817193,4817338,5,0,IsaacL,,,"This.<p>The ebook career.fork() that came out recently had more on this. Basically, you can learn to spot ""clients from hell"". There are certain traits that are the equivalent of pointy horns and a whiff of brimstone:<p>- excessive cheapness in initial negotiations<p>- ""but we can just find a guy on odesk for $5/hour"" (reply: OK, you do that, and come find me when it falls apart).<p>- no effort to understand technical issues. Of course, lots of good clients don't understand technical issues (that's why they hired you), but at least show some interest in what you're doing.<p>- unrealistic expectations (I want the next Facebook!)<p>- very vague ideas about what they want. ""I need a website made!"" Lots of good clients also have vague ideas, but its your job to help them figure out exactly what they need. Try sitting down with them with a pen and paper and listing what pages they need and an outline of the content for each one.<p>Now, some clients will happily sketch out Balsamiq type mockups, wheras others will just give you a brief list of the pages they need and let you work out the details. Both are fine. But if the client refuses this exercise, stay away.<p>My big surprise when freelancing was that most clients are not from hell. If you just avoid the jokers, there are plenty of good clients that value your work and pay on time.<p>Other tips:<p>- taking a deposit at the start is always good. It's like the client has ""broken the seal"" and will be more willing to pay in future.<p>- it's hard asking for payment. It's the social norm against asking for strangers for money. One advantage of paycheck employment is the only time you need to discuss money is in the interview. After the first few invoices, it gets easier.<p>- avoid getting desperate. When you only have one week's rent in your account, you might be tempted to take on a bad client. Easier said than done, but maintain a buffer of savings and start looking for gigs before your current one finishes.<p>- be a bit cynical. Even if the clients are the nicest, coolest people in the world, if your code is on their server and your money is in their account, it's quite easy for them not to pay you. If you control the code, and some of the money (ie, a deposit), you're in a much stronger position.",1353563033

You don't have to wait for political reform or constitutional amendments.  Disbar the people who are responsible for abuse.  Then let the system work.  Bar associations feel local pressure.

4817616,comment,4813416,4816049,6,0,robomartin,,,"> You can pull a 10 tonne yacht with one hand on a rope. Try pulling a 10 tonne truck...<p>This probably deserves a little more attention.<p>Having done a lot of sailing as well as ocean-fishing on different size vessels I know exactly what you are talking about.  What you might be confusing is that at zero speed there's a huge difference between something floating on water and a truck resting on the ground.<p>In the case of a large boat floating on water, so long as you are not after making it move quickly you are almost just fighting inertia.  So, yes, a fifteen year old kid pulling on a rope could make a large boat move.<p>When it comes to a truck sitting on the ground you have to contend with rolling friction as well as the static friction (because nothing is moving) and the viscous drag of all the mechanical elements, oil and grease in the drivetrain.  It could take hundreds of pounds of force to get it to budge.  Once your break through static friction then you have a much reduced dynamic friction and viscous drag (oil and grease in the drivetrain) --again, so long as speed is very, very low-- as well as the rolling friction of the tires.<p>If, on the other hand, that truck was resting on a frozen lake bed and if the tires are not frozen-glued into the ice, and, if the ice is not deformed under the tires, the same fifteen year old kid could move it just as well as he moved the boat.  In fact, it might even be easier because there isn't a significant v^3 component to the power required to make it move.<p>Once you start to add speed to the problem it is easy to see that moving the same object through water will require at least 830 times more water.<p>At speed the power required to counter drag comes into play.<p><pre><code>  Power = 1/2 * fluid density * velocity ^3 * coefficient of drag * area
</code></pre>
Here's an easy experiment:  Take a tennis racket and duct-tape the strung area in order to make it a solid paddle.  No air or water should get through.  Now swing it in air as fast as you can.  Now go into a swimming pool and try to swing it just as hard under water.  Unless you are super-human you will not be able to.  In fact, you won't be able to even get close to the speed in air.  Again, simply stated, you need over 800 times more power to achieve the same speed in water with the same object.<p>If it takes one horsepower to move something in air at a given speed you'll need over 800 horsepower to achieve the same speed in water.  It's the difference between a model airplane engine and a Formula 1 race car engine.<p>There's a good article in Wikepedia on drag:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)</a><p>Get down to the ""Power"" heading.  That's the formula you want to look at.<p>To get back to your yacht vs. truck example.  What you would really have to experience is pulling each of them at 20 or 30 miles per hour with a rope (chain?).  Of course, it would take super-human strength and endurance to be able to do that.",1353562390

It is so different from radio content that I am a bit confused when people say that radio will be their competition.<p>I have two types of commutes with two very different sets of problems. I drive a car and ride the T (subway) in and around Boston/Cambridge.<p>When driving I (obviously) can't read.  When riding the T it is usually a pain to read because there is no reception so the content must be preloaded and on top of that there are often no seats. It is not fun trying to operate an iPad[1] with one hand while holding onto a bar for dear life with the other.<p>Umano solves the car problem by having real humans reading to me and giving me the ability to queue multiple articles in advance.  Once the app allows users to preload content it will solve all of my T pain points because I will be able get my news fix aurally without any reception needed.  I would gladly pay for that.<p>Also, as others have mentioned, I see this as much more than an app for commuters.  This seems perfect for the gym.<p>[1] I don't enjoy reading on the iPhone if I can help it because of the need to constantly scroll.",1353560813

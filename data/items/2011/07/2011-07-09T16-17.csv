Buy 2 get one free, promo codes offered after every sale, more promo codes if you tweet / share on FB, etc. Standard shipping is free world wide.<p>- Social: Initially sell 10 models for men and 10 for women.

Given current technology it is not reasonable possible to decrypt strongly encrypted data, however - there is strong evidence that using quantum computers this task is a matter of seconds. This technology is well defined theoretically already, just not reasonably implementable so far, which might be just a matter of some decade of time. In this respect, an encryption is the virtual equivalent of a safe, yes.<p>There is a complete other point I want to bring to your attention - our computers not only contain evidence, they also (might) contain lot of private and sensitive data, things you don't want anybody to know and where constitutional protection might fit since it's unrelated (I'm not knowledgable in the respective laws though, that's why I say 'might'), like a mental cache, and also hyper-links to other unrelated storages and networks (you can store much more virtual things on a computer than in a physical safe) - this makes a computer and it's disk somewhat different from a safe. It can potentially contain anything and the government would get access to a chain of homes like wandering through worm-holes because they were given one important entry code. This might affect the privacy of several other people, and they might not agree with that procedure. What is the law saying here?

Hardly. Apple also give apps away for free to consumers, if developer chooses to distribute it for free. 
Apple still makes money from selling hardware not ads. 
What'g getjar business model? Oh, yes:<p><pre><code>  > We were built by developers, to help developers.

No mention about selling ads? Will having more free stuff attract more visits? Will it give more

That is the basis of the law, and if indeed you are incrementing yourself by providing a passphrase for an encrypted container, you don't have to provide it; in a nutshell you are dead wrong.<p>Your metaphors about a password being a locked door and this and that is nonsense, a password is not a locked door.  A locked door is a locked door.  An encrypted file that is password protected is an encrypted file that is password protected, I don't have to let anyone look at anything If I don't want to, regardless if they have a warrant; they will just bust in anyway.<p>When police have a warrant, lots of times they don't even knock on the door, but just barge their way in.  They can attempt to do the same with the encrypted file, they can brute their way in, but you are not required by law to help them accomplish this.<p>""Although the only way the password content can be incriminating is via the language of the password,"".  This is you guessing and making things up.  This is you spouting your opinion 100%.  If I have something extremely illegal on an encrypted container, than giving the password is most certainly incriminating my own self.  This fantasy you have that the only self-incrementing that can occur is if the password itself is a sentence stating guilt is the biggest load of bullshit I've read on ycombinator in a long time, wherever did you come up with this nonsense I'll never know.<p>Your attitude towards bending over and letting any government official rape you, is unsettling at the least, and a terrible sign of where our society is at the most.  I pray there are as little people sharing your opinion out there as possible, else I weep for the future of society.<p>Also, please tell me what they could possibly do if one claims to have forgotten the passphrase?  Presidents for years have gotten away with everything by stating, ""I can't recall"" on tough questions; who's to say with all the fuss and scary guns pointed at you during the raid, you totally forgot your passphrase?  How could anyone ever prove you actually forgot it or not?  Charged with obstruction of justice you say?  Imagine if the contents on the encrypted container itself would get me into 10,000 times more trouble than an obstruction of justice charge, then obviously I've done the smart thing.",1310227687

""Sweatshops"", as we see them today, would not occur in an ideal Randian world, as, in free economies, competitors inevitably arise and are more than happy to take your underpaid employees off your hands.<p>The fact that sweatshops <i>do</i> exist does not prove this false...you'll notice that almost all sweatshops exist in third world countries that are notorious for government corruption.  When Rand spoke of freedom, she wasn't joking, she meant real freedom, meaning politicians that are <i>not</i> on the take, that couldn't yank an operating license from a competitor who chose to offer better working conditions.<p>If you want to speculate and say honesty is literally impossible in human society, feel free, but that is something entirely different than saying that freedom leads to sweatshops.",1236135083

After around 500k net worth, money is more about status and ranking than anything else--something that happens to be preserved under a graduated tax.

And it was well received. Also, after DVD's and songs on Itunes, Joss Whedon has recouped all of the costs.<p>I do see your point though. Making high quality video is very hard. It cost Joss Whedon around $200,000 to make. And Joss Whedon has a cult following, so just having his name on it gave the project a lot of P.R. And Joss Whedon has been involved with Hollywood movies and television shows, so he has the experience necessary to make a high quality show.<p>I wonder if the entertainment industry is headed to a model comparable to venture capitalism. Media Companies might be forced to split their services into two sections. They would act like a vc firm and give money to producers in exchange for a percent of the gross. And they could sell access to their distribution network. I'm sure that no media company would want to do this willingly though. It would mean giving up control over the ip rights, and they would have to find new distribution methods.<p>Hulu:<a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/28327/dr-horribles-sing-along-blog-act-one"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hulu.com/watch/28327/dr-horribles-sing-along-blog...</a><p>Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Horrible%27s_Sing-Along_Blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Horrible%27s_Sing-Along_Blo...</a>",1236133967

You deliver a really niche audience.  It is possible that my niche times your niche equals a number of interested prospects so low that it is not worth my (very expensive) time to investigate, implement, and optimize your ads.  Remember, advertising on a competing website who uses AdWords costs me <i>no time at all</i> at the margin.<p>2)  I only want to pay for traffic that has a chance of converting.  One provider I used, who will remain nameless, charge me the same prices Google does.  However, my ad (for a product which is culturally only well-suited to American customers) was getting displayed in the middle of education websites in Spain.  And I was getting charged full price for that.<p>3)  My time is very, very expensive -- I shoot for $100 an hour.  Let's say it takes, oh, two hours to get everything set up for your website, including conversion tracking, writing copy to conform to your requirements, etc.  And lets say that you deliver sales to me at, oh, $10 apiece.<p>$30 product - $10 for you = $20 for me, per sale.  (We'll ignore my other marginal costs since I essentially don't have any.)  $200 / $20 = 10 sales required to break even against my time.  2% conversion rate implies I usually need roughly 500 free trial downloads to generate 10 sales.  20% conversion to free trial implies I would need 2,500 clicks from interested users to generate 500 free downloads.<p>So to just break even with my time for setting up your service once, I need 2,500 clicks from interested users.  That is if you deliver absurdly high ROI immediately right out of the gate.  If you don't, then I need to analyze results and optimize my ads for you, and that again has an imputed value of $100 per hour.<p>Most non-Google advertising platforms I have tried require far too much of my time to justify the returns they have provided.",1236132529

Each of them, as well, has an active program in place to seek out charitable contributions from alumni and other likely victims.

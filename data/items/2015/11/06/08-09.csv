10518429,comment,10517717,10518083,0,0,rcthompson,,,"The sample minimum (or maximum) is not an inherently unstable statistic. If there is sufficient density in the distribution near its minimum, the sample minimum can be quite robust. For example, consider that the maximum likelihood estimator for the upper bound of a uniform distribution is simply the sample maximum, and the minimum-variance unbiased estimator is also based on the sample maximum[1]. (This method was used by the Allies in World War 2 to estimate the total number of German tanks by sampling the serial numbers from destroyed tanks[2].)<p>Of course, a real thresholding process would not be perfect, so the lower bound of the distribution of accepted candidates would not be a perfect vertical cutoff as in the examples. Just like any process that adds additional variation to the data, this would reduce the statistical power. You could accept more bias in return for lower variance in your test by taking, say, the 5th percentile instead of the sample minimum as your test statistic. (You can think of the sample minimum as the zeroth percentile.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_%28continuous%29#Estimation_of_maximum"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_%28contin...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem</a>",1446799904

To me this quote implied quite a few things:<p>1) There isn&#x27;t much of a chance being &#x27;in the middle&#x27; of price and quality--you&#x27;ll get beat by competition that focuses on price or on quality.<p>2) Business is harder at the price end because it&#x27;s harder to maintain a competitive edge.  At this end of the market there are diminishing returns when trying to keep your costs low. You&#x27;re also at risk of &#x27;technological leap frogging&#x27; from competitors who discover a way of doing things cheaper than you.<p>3) Margins are always going to be tight because there is a race to the bottom.<p>So, how does this relate to the article?  Well I think Robo-Advice is on the &#x27;cheap&#x27; end of the market and the solution for human advisers is to go up market.<p>In this market, economies of scale are based on the size of your clients&#x27; investment portfolio.<p>Sure there will be disruption but there will always be humans who want &#x27;the best&#x27; and who will perceive robots to be inferior to humans.  The challenge would be to market &#x27;the human touch&#x27; as being better than a robot to maintain that perception to your target market.<p>I think this logic can be applied to most other industries facing the same robot vs human prospects.",1446799271

10518409,comment,10518033,10518340,0,0,moonchrome,,,"Dart has such a strange story.<p>When it started out it was completely uninteresting as a language and it&#x27;s only selling feature was that it someday might find it&#x27;s way in to browsers and that it compiles to JS.<p>Now that it&#x27;s ditched the whole &quot;replace JS in browser&quot; the language has actually matured enough to the point where I would code in it outside of browser use case and the VM quality puts it in a unique performance/productivity spot. It is very much a hybrid of C# and Python in good ways with a decent package manager built in.<p>It&#x27;s much more suitable to be viewed as a high performance Python replacement - unlike Go it&#x27;s dynamically typed but offers optional static typing so the level of abstraction is much closer to Python - in fact I would argue that the static typing built in from start makes it more productive than python for project you need to scale up to multiple people.<p>But it was built by a VM team that knows how to get performance and knows the bottlenecks that prevent JS optimizations - so it&#x27;s probably faster than V8 and the likes - not CPyhon level.<p>The VM/class library is small and embeddable which separates it from Java.<p>And finally the compile to browser was a design choice from the start so compile to JS is much simpler than existing languages (eg. Python/Java)<p>It&#x27;s a great language for client side programming and it&#x27;s usable in server side if you are already using it for client side and want same languages on both server and client.",1446799223

Without loss of generality, imagine that you have two populations, A and B, and that you want to test some hypothesis about a statistic of A being different from a statistic of B (mean, in this case). Using the simplest form of the bootstrap you would do the following:<p>1. Pool and randomly label the data from A and B\n2. Sample with replacement and form two partitions of the same cardinality as the original A and B groups\n3. Compute the differences in mean\n4. Rinse and repeat millions of times to form a distribution of mean differences\n5. Check if the observed difference in means (from the true A/B labels) is statistically significant relative to the distribution found in (4)<p>This has some problems with fat tailed distributions but tends to work great otherwise.

(One of the authors constructed a small-scale prototype a few years earlier.)  If this is correct, a facility to remove all of the 29 billion tonnes of CO₂ emitted by human activities annually would cost C$4 trillion to build (about one month of global GDP) and cost US$1.7 trillion per year to operate (about 5% of global GDP, comparable to the total amount currently being spent on energy.)<p>That is, unless Keith&#x27;s analysis is wrong, low-risk geoengineering to completely remediate current CO₂ emissions is clearly economically feasible, but not as a skunkworks project — it&#x27;s a project of a size comparable to the entire existing energy industry, so it would need to be supported by the full influence of the current Establishment.  It clearly cannot be done as a market-driven project.<p>These costs, already somewhat pessimistic, should come down a bit as energy becomes cheaper with the proliferation of photovoltaic farms.

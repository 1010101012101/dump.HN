2362912,comment,2362561,2362561,0,0,farout,,,"Having been a hi-tech quota exceeding :-) sales rep for a number years, here is what I advise:<p>1. Hire two reps: one for each coast. Even two part-time reps at each coast I say is better than one rep running around from coast to coast. Time wasting and regionally differences do crop up.<p>2. Read the the book, Selling to Big Companies.<p>3. Yes sell yourself so you understand the issues involved.<p>4. ""Salespeople are notorious for giving excuses when they don't meet the sales targets they agreed to.""<p>This is usually when the owner does not understand the market or misestimates the market. Any good sales person will leave and stop wasting time with people that will not  work with them to make sales happen. It takes a company to sell. Especially if you want the easy and lucrative referrals.<p>What is the price point for this product? 
Who at the customer site will ultimately say yes?<p>At one company, it was easy to sell since the network engineer was the main guy/gal that had to approve the technical aspects. I just made sure they understood the personal utility of our product as well so they had a personal stake on how their life would with us or a competitor's product.<p>read the book, it is totally awesome. Having done the job for a number of years, I still learned lots of usually things that I was able to use immediately.<p>In terms of what to offer, I guess it really depends. Realize in the beginning you are really doing business development not just sales. So there needs to be more of a salary cushion. A low end salesperson is usually 40/40. 40k salary and 40k commission. Realize that the you are hiring a profession and not asking them to necessarily do charity work. However, together estimate the metrics of sales and the where the number of sales at each level in the sales pipeline. Also come up with remediation plans. Say in 2 months, you expect the rep will have made 5 sales. What happens if they have only made 2 sales. Have everything spelled out so everyone knows the ramifications and there are fewer surprises.",1300942471

If someone can't pick up and move to SF, they can run their startup from anywhere.  The great part about right now is that you can start up a business with pretty much nothing.<p>""From a statistical point of view, however, poverty will beget more poverty because the average poor person will not have enough second chances to make it out.""<p>Some decisions in life have long-lasting consequences.  The poor should be concentrating on not making those bad decisions in the first place.  Another problem is environmental.  Parents pass their bad habits and decision making onto their kids.  Wealthy parents most likely already have good habits and pass those good habits onto their kids.<p>""If we want society to improve, we MUST provide a way for the average poor person to get past some of their mistakes. Yes, it looks like undeserved handouts, but I think it's the right thing to do.""<p>I don't think I can agree with you here.  If we allow people to easily get past their mistakes, they will continue to make them (and society won't improve)  If you know that a mistake can cost you pain and suffering in the future, you will most likely think twice before making it.

The old folks still in Detroit in decent neighborhoods will not be areas with the cheap houses you are looking for (yes, there are some really nice areas in the city).""<p>I don't mean ""old, rich folks"". East Austin was poor, mostly black and hispanic, and crime-ridden for decades before a resurgence began in the early 00s. But, a lot of the residents are still old folks who've lived through the whole process of decline and rebirth. Houston experienced white flight, and then began to recover in some of the older neighborhoods surrounding downtown (as far as I know downtown Houston is still a graveyard at night, and may not be fixable because there is no housing, the ground level streets are non-porous and have no shopping or nightlife). Same story, lots of older home owners that never left; their kids were grown when white flight happened, so they didn't feel as compelled to follow the good schools or were too poor to move or just didn't want to leave their home and stubbornly stuck around.<p>But, the rest of your answer is awesome, and is exactly what I was looking for. I don't actually need a house to cost $1 to consider it a good deal. But, it would take a really good price to get me to buy property in a place with weather as bad as Detroit. Hell, the place is unlivably cold six months out of the year, as far as this Texan is concerned. But, I'd consider buying to have a cheap summer parking place in a cool and interesting town, and if it happens to come with a house built in the 40s or 50s that I could renovate a bit, that's gravy.",1300941614

If he was well-known before that, I was not aware of it.<p>I think there's a lot more to be said on the subject than a comparison of the degrees of Taubes and Fumento (and, really, since when is a masters degree in engineering and journalism qualification to tell people how to eat any more than a law degree?).<p>I'm not qualified to argue about whether Taubes is completely wrong about everything (which seems unlikely; even a broken clock is right twice a day) But, I do know that he is distinctly at odds with the majority of scientists who work in the dietary field. I'm talking about real scientists, with real science degrees. Doing real controlled scientific studies. Most of them consider Atkins a disaster for public health.<p>I'm willing to believe that the food industry has an unhealthy effect on the debate and the corn and cereal grain industries have a vested interest in seeing grains elevated to a holy position in the food pyramid. There may be a vasty wrongness about huge swaths of what we know about how we should be eating for maximum health. But, just like I have a hard time believing every scientist working in climate science is under the thumb of some great conspiracy to foist a global warming lie on the world...I can't really believe that every dietary scientist working would participate in a great scam, which is what you have to believe to believe that Taubes is mostly right.<p>""I think his main point is that the post WW2 infatuation with low-fat diets has been a disaster.""<p>And the scientists he quoted have said repeatedly that the disaster is that we eat 20% more calories per day, in general, than we did before WW2, and that increased fat consumption also occurred during that time. The belief that ""low-fat = healthy"" is certainly a dangerous belief to have. But, the belief that a diet of almost exclusively animal proteins and fats is healthy is also pretty dangerous, as far as I can tell.<p>I started reading Taubes work after reading <i>4 Hour Body</i>, since some of the theories in 4HB come directly from Taubes, and some of the bonus materials on the website are written by Taubes. But, the more I read up on him the less confidence I had in his scientific integrity.<p>In short: I don't know all the answers. But I'm pretty confident Taubes doesn't know either.",1300941027

I know you're feeling defensive, but humor me for a moment, and let's assume I'm right, and Gina Trapani is right, and all the people who have retweeted this pair of essays are right.<p>If we're right, and you're wrong, then that discomfort and defensiveness you're feeling right now is fear.  You're afraid I might be talking about you.  You're realizing you've never examined your opinions about this issue, you've just assumed you're smart enough to not be sexist, or racist, or bigoted in any substantial way, and this bothers you quite a bit, to perhaps not be as smart as you thought.<p>You're also afraid that I'm talking about your community, the one that gives you a strong sense of identity, and no-one else in your community has ever talked about this, so it must not be an issue, right?  This outsider!  How dare she!<p>Maybe you're even afraid because it's a girl calling you out.  A girl emasculating you, just like all the others who have called you out for one reason or another.  They're all the same!  Fucking bitches, man!  Perhaps this is pushing it.  Perhaps this resonates with someone.<p>Except, hi, I'm Vitorio.  I'm a guy.  I've worked with Linux for fifteen years.  I grew up on IRC.  I've contributed code patches to open source projects.  I've released open source software.  I've written documentation and helped with design and done support for open source software.  I'm part of your community, too.  Which means I'm saying this is a problem in <i>our</i> community.<p>I believe this is a serious, cultural problem.  No-one talks about it in our community because everyone believes they're too smart to be sexist.  And, yet, there's a long list of well-documented sexism-related incidents in open source, including sexual assault at the most recent ApacheCon: <a href=""http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/index.php?title=Timeline_of_incidents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/index.php?title=Timeline_of_in...</a><p>Do you know how I know it's a long list?  Because it exists at all.<p>Obviously, we're not all too smart.  But I don't just believe it's a few bad apples.  I think we're mostly bad apples in this regard.  Why?<p>I believe part of the sexism is cultural from how you were brought up: as a male in most cultures you are raised inherently sexist and the culture itself encourages sexist gender roles and a rape culture and such.<p>I believe part of the sexism is cultural from the people you associate with: it's like that xkcd comic, sometimes it's ""you're bad at math"" and sometimes it's ""girls are bad at math,"" and both are culturally damaging, but the latter is much worse and drives a ton of people away and any tolerance for it is a gateway for worse behavior.<p>You've probably recently been involved with a sexist, racist, homophobic or otherwise bigoted joke.  Maybe you made one.  Maybe you laughed at one.  Maybe you read Slashleen on Twitter.  I made one at dinner tonight, for example.  Everyone laughed, including the overweight, homosexual black man who was with us.  It doesn't make it funny, and it doesn't make it okay.  It's still bigotry, and it's still wrong.  I also called out a coworker for calling something ""gay"" yesterday.  One doesn't make up for the other.<p>That's why I'm not going to read your mailing lists to pass judgment on whether your communities are sexist or not.  It's possible for them to all be and for you to be unqualified to judge.  It's not all or nothing, it's not one or the other.  IRC is worse than mailing lists are, in my experience.  IRL is both better and has the potential to be much worse.<p>That's also why the Penny Arcade ""Dickwolves"" issue was so important: they made a rape joke.  It was considered to be promoting rape culture.  I agree that it was.  Jokes about rape perpetuate the idea that rape is somehow okay or normal.  You don't encourage anything that seems to promote a negative behavior.  For me, it was less that the comic promoted rape culture and more that their response, their not understanding why it could possibly be an issue since they didn't ""mean it that way,"" was totally wrong, and that incomprehension was completely representative of gamers and OSS developers alike.<p>I also wish I had bought a Dickwolves tee.  That makes me part of the problem.  But, I heard once that a sign of intelligence is being able to hold two conflicting thoughts in your head at the same time.  I can believe the OSS community is generally sexist, perhaps even misogynistic, and be both disappointed and unsurprised by the HN reaction to these essays, and still comment here.  It's not really my place to judge you, or even teach you, because that means teaching self-awareness.<p>I believe your defensiveness reflects your lack of cultural self-awareness to understand that not only might your community be inherently sexist, but that you might also be.<p>I understand that I am.  It's not that you're not allowed to have an opinion, you are, but ""I feel like this is a personal attack"" is a feeling.  I am intentionally writing antagonistically to provoke you into thinking about this constructively.<p>Now, you can go back to your original feeling.  Thanks so much for humoring me.  Whatever opinion you end up holding, I hope it's a strong opinion, loosely held, and I hope you actually have reasons for holding it.",1300940684

Corporations will buy non-GPL licenses so they can redistribute on their own terms, but consumers won't because they don't intend to redistribute in the first place. It's hard to sell GPL software to consumers because as soon as someone sees it's going well, they'll rush in to sell cheaper versions of the same product, and soon it will devolve into something that's not really worth the time. I would love to see a GPL-like license that kept the code accessible and modifiable, but restricted distribution to a subset of persons approved by the copyright owner (i.e., licensed). This would actually make it viable to sell OSS to consumers. While the real GPL may be better and freer, I think that such a license would be a net benefit as it could result in much wider availability of code for programs that people run, which would be a win even if the distribution conditions were more stringent.",1300940223

The old folks still in Detroit in decent neighborhoods will not be areas with the cheap houses you are looking for (yes, there are some really nice areas in the city). The others probably left for nice areas outside of the city.<p>You'll probably want to look where the current wave of young people are moving to. I really don't know what these areas are but I'm sure you can look some up.<p>Midtown, with Wayne State University and the Detroit Medical Center, is probably a good area. Don't know too much about it but Tech Town[1] is at WSU. They are offering incentives to get employees to move and live in Midtown. I don't know that you'll find any super cheap housing there.<p>You could also look somewhere like Ferndale. It's just on the other side of 8 mile and maybe a 10-15 minute drive from downtown. You won't find the super-cheap $300 houses but you can find a really good deal. It's a nice, young, liberal town just on the border. It's also next to Royal Oak, a little more expensive area where you'll find a lot of young professionals. So that covers centrally located, safe and cheap, not super-cheap, but also not in Detroit proper, which also means lower taxes (as far as I understand).<p>I guess it all depends on your motivation.

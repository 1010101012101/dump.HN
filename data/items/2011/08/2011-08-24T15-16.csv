2921192,comment,2919708,2919874,5,0,wes-exp,,,"This. Take for example the American Medical Association:<p>From Wikipedia:
Economist Milton Friedman, [has] asserted that the organization acts as a guild and has attempted to increase physicians' wages and fees by influencing limitations on the supply of physicians and non-physician competition. In Free to Choose, Friedman said ""the AMA has engaged in extensive litigation charging chiropractors and osteopathic physicians with the unlicensed practice of medicine, in an attempt to restrict them to as narrow an area as possible.""<p>So AMA works to increase physicians' wages. Now let's think about what the ACM is doing:<p>- Trying to increase international membership. This benefits ACM in terms of dues, but I'm not really sure how it benefits members as programmers. If anything, it could hurt them. Don't we face enough international competition as it is?<p>- Promoting programming education as part of core curriculum in high school. WTF? Last thing I need is every dipshit who ever took a class thinking he can write software.<p>TL;DR: American Medical Association serves its members. ACM doesn't seem to help its professional programmer members whatsoever.<p>Edit: I suppose ACM is serving teachers on the above points? ACM has a lot of academic members. Maybe what's need is a separate programmer's association.",1314201596

This way, you don't even have to make it into an app, just host the html and js somewhere and run it in the browser while you show it to people.

It has to do with a much better indicator: blood flow through organs.<p>The goal of compressions in CPR is to keep blood flowing so organs (especially the brain) can get ""fresh"" (oxygen-rich) blood and get rid of their CO2 buildup. Because blood ""naturally"" goes through the gas exchange of the lungs during its travels, CO2 output is a very good indicator of blood circulating correctly, and therefore internal organs having a chance.<p>As long as the CO2 output is good, the brain (and other organs, but mainly the brain) can be considered protected (alive) and the patient can be saved if whatever went wrong is fixed (generally the heart restarted or arrhythmia managed)<p>The problem of checking the pulse is that it's a very bad indicator of whether your compressions are working: it does not indicate anything about them, it just tells you if the heart is beating strong enough to generate a pulse.

While LGPL isn't particularly horrible, it still has restrictions that BSD license doesn't have.  Hence, there possible uses (where contributing code back) isn't an option due to business goals of an organization.   Even if you have some ability to contribute back, LGPL requires due-diligence that can amount to a substantial amount of time: including involving IP attorneys to render a professional opinion.<p>I think GPL (and LGPL in some cases) makes sense for dual-licensing situations, where your company turns down contributors who don't assign copyright.  This only works if the money invested keeps enough velocity that GPL-forks (ala Drizzle fork of MySQL) don't get traction.<p>Without the dual-licensing approach, I think it then comes down to values.  Do you want more commercial adoption, even if someone makes additional improvements and sells them as proprietary software (BSD/MIT)?  Or, do you want to force commercial adopters to contribute back (GPL/LGPL).<p>I use PostgreSQL has a solid example of how BSD/MIT works, including commercial forks -- some of which is contributed back.  It turns out that maintaining your own fork is quite expensive and most companies typically contribute back without being compelled since it's cheaper & provides kudos.  Even for companies that keep a proprietary fork (ala GreenPlum), they still contribute indirectly by funding engineers that know the code base and providing commercial options for users of the software.

While the NSA and CIA may have some capability beyond listening in on enemy communications, I question whether the responsibility to make attacks on foreign targets which could be considered acts of war should be left separate from the military.<p>Weaponizing computers can have a much broader use that would be appropriate for a Cyber Force in addition to military intelligence operations. For example, today we might want to knock out a communications array, a factory, or a power plant in enemy territory. Our options at the moment are to send in missiles, bomber jets, or an elite ground unit. But those aren't always good options. The missiles and bombs could cause unwanted collateral damage to civilians. Missiles and bombers are crazy expensive and so is the cost to get them to the target. The risks to using an elite ground unit are enormous not only to the unit itself but to foreign policy if they are killed or captured.<p>But a Cyber Force could electronically disrupt or disable a facility through any number of means. This would be far cheaper in terms of financial and human costs. Even if there are counter measures in place for the facility to run offline on a private grid, such an attack could sufficiently hinder it until it can be disabled more permanently.<p>This is no different than sending a bomber jet instead of an infantry platoon. The goal is to make a surgical strike, the generals need to choose the right tool for the job. For an increasingly large class of technologically advanced targets in increasingly urban areas the military will more often want to employ hackers instead of bombers.<p>The point, then, was that this will be equally true for enemies wishing to attack the United States. A dedicated team of hackers can easily cause as much or more damage than a fleet of bombers. And the United States can either be ready for it or watch as enemies walk over them with impunity like the United States air force flies over enemies today.",1314199000

As an aspiring entrepreneur, I find this rather encouraging. However, I am looking for data or detailed stories on failed entrepreneurs with more than just a few data-points. Successful founders get a lot more media attention than failed ones, so information on the latter seems to be generally lacking on the Internet. What do founders do after failure? How do they know they have failed? Where do they go next? If they do another startup, is it harder to get funded by VCs? If they look for a regular job, is their experience running a startup valued? Are there other hidden challenges a failed founder must face? Not to be a pessimist, but I feel information about failed founders is a bit of a blind spot for me (and maybe others too), and it would be very useful to get more factual data about this subject, from members of the HN community.",1314198876

2920982,comment,2920484,2920484,6,0,philp,,,"'Embarrassing revelation' indeed. How in the world is it possible that a German court can impose a EU-wide ban in a trial that contained what is basically fabricated evidence? How did this slip past Samsung's lawyers ( I remember this whole thing blowing up at the hands of the tech media, no? ) Didn't the court do its own, independent, impartial research into the matter? Why didn't the court compare some physical devices as opposed to basing a decision with such far-reaching consequences on some printed pictures?! Can somebody who has studied the law explain to me the benefit of allowing plaintiffs to have command over which court they want to litigate in? It feels self-defeating.<p>After reading this I'm also surprised how the author of this article can possibly assess that, ""theres also Dusseldorf, Germany, where judges are proving themselves quick [and] competent"" after this incident that demonstrate just how patently (!) incompetent they really are. But I guess this is just testimony to the fact that actual evidence and reason are tertiary in a justice system that can be defeated by cherry-picking courts that are friendly to whatever the litigator's cause. How can the public trust in a judiciary framework that functions with this total lack of precision and attention to detail.<p>On a different note, and I'm sure nobody really cares but since Dsseldorf is my hometown I'd like to point out that it is spelled with an umlaut. If for some reason you can't do that, how about spelling it Duesseldorf :) That's how it's done in German if you can't use the umlaut for any reason (url's etc.). Is it common to just leave out diacritics when dealing with foreign vocabulary in the english language ?",1314198621

2920971,comment,2919708,2920727,2,0,Spyro7,,,"<i>""There is a concentration of tech startups in SV because the internet lets them sell to the rest of the country without issue.""</i><p>I don't think so. If the Internet was all that was needed to explain this concentration, then that would not be a sufficient explanation because it would prompt a new question. If geographical proximity was due to the Internet, then why Silicon Valley vs some other location?<p>I think that it is  more likely that there are a high concentration of tech startups in SV because the concentration of tech companies in SV offers positive externalities to firms that locate themselves in SV. This is not a very good article (even by wikipedia standards), but I think that it could help to paint a picture:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration</a><p>But then, you are right. If tech companies needed to be within a hundred miles of their customers in order to transact business with them, then they would not be able to benefit from agglomeration effects. But I think that there are probably other things that factor into as well - margins, competition, regulations, etc.<p><i>""Brick layers / construction are far less mobile because you need to be at the construction site to build a brick wall.""</i><p>I agree, this is true. Perhaps I should have been more selective with my examples. One more thing that is also true is that a side effect of their lack of mobility is that it is more challenging for them to scale vis-a-vis the technology companies.<p><i>""PS: Read the millionaire next door and you find a lot of people in the use that made a few million from those bricklaying startups. The main difference is it often took them 20 years to get where software companies got in 5.""</i><p>The OP cited bricklayers as an example of million-dollar startup companies not being unique to the computer industry. I think that your point about how challenging it is to scale more conventional ""mobility-challenged"" businesses is actually a very convincing argument against the idea that starting a computer company and starting a bricklayer company offer comparable potential rewards.<p>Holding all other factors constant, if bricklayer startups are more geographically limited than tech startups, then it is reasonable to hypothesize that tech startups have a higher probability of becoming million-dollar companies.<p>Also, with regards to the <i>Millionaire Next Door</i>, I think that it is worth repeating the old axiom: the plural of anecdote is not data.",1314198455

Lessons learned so far:<p>- Fragmentation on Android is a b<i></i><i></i>.  Especially when dealing with hardware stuff like cameras, expect to do a lot of device specific coding.  Front-facing cameras are a perfect example.  Gingerbread solves these problems in theory, but not in practice.<p>- Uploading video files over mobile connection is non-trivial (duh) - We've put a lot of work towards reliable and efficient uploads and downloads (intelligent packetization, retry logic, etc).  We solve for the ""elevator scenario"".  User sends a message, but steps into an elevator half way through delivery.  Aside from Gmail, most mobile apps suck at this.<p>- On the positive side, 4G+ speeds are really impressive.<p>- Creating a portrait oriented camera application for Android is way harder than it should be (really poor API implementation around camera rotations).  Contrast to iOS where it's super easy.<p>- UX matters - A friction-free UX required a lot of work.  We had many alpha testers (both family and friends & paid services like usertesting.com/mobile) that helped us find the sticking points.<p>We'd love your feedback on anything!",1314198277

This has a lot in common with POD books.<p>For a computer like this, you simply don't gain a lot. It's mostly prefab components, with a bit of PCB and soldering.

9672806,comment,9672249,9672758,0,0,ekianjo,,,"> TGV is highly profitable in France.<p>LOL. French here. I am not sure where you get that impression, but TGV lines cost dozens of billions of euros to be built, and the ROI is calculated in 30-40 years time, so saying the &quot;TGV is highly profitable&quot; is a pure lie, because we don&#x27;t know in 40 years if people will still take it as much as now. On top of that, the SNCF (public company operating the TGV) is a sponge debt and if it were not for the ongoing government spending to keep it alive every single year with huge cash injections, it would have disappeared long ago.<p>Yeah &quot;highly profitable&quot;, hey.",1433635183

9672792,comment,9671683,9672699,0,0,manigandham,,,"1) There are only two <i>viable</i> business models <i>today</i>. The exceptions are not viable; just because a few can do it doesn&#x27;t mean they can be used for the mainstream. And I didnt say there can&#x27;t be more nor was I implying it since I talk about possible future alternatives - it&#x27;s just reality today only has 2. When more show up and actually prove to work, then there will be more.<p>2) Both options in a moral argument cant be moral. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s moral for people to use programs to tamper with what a content provider has given you in exchange for providing that content (which they have full rights to) for free. The usage of the programs isnt the issue, it&#x27;s what and how it&#x27;s used for. Modifying a site to make text bigger is fine for example, modifying it to circumvent the advertising explicitly is morally wrong.<p>3) The reasons why people want to block ads are fine. Most people want more performance, security and privacy. Adblock and it&#x27;s blunt approach of blocking everything as well as the extortion businesses run by the adblocking companies is immoral. Wanting something and doing it are different, as well as the method. I&#x27;m arguing that adblocking as a method is wrong.<p>4) I&#x27;m not sure what other word I could use... it&#x27;s based on principals since it&#x27;s not law or hard rules, unless you count breaking terms of use on sites.

Looks as if you have a especial hatred for fellow Indians which is coming out so evidently in your threads.<p>Now, let us go over your examples. Both of the areas you cited have traditionally been inhabited by not-so-well-to-do Indians which could be one of the reasons why they aren&#x27;t well maintained. Little India in Singapore was originally inhabited by Indian immigrants - many of whom were very poor and uneducated and the area generally took its cue from there. Newark St in Jersey City, too, has largely been inhabited by poor early immigrant Indians (such as those who drive taxis in NYC) and Indians who come onsite (and thus are in heavy savings mode).<p>To give a counter to your example why don&#x27;t you visit Sunnyvale and Fremont on the west coast which are heavily populated by the Indian community. Given how you have generalized, those areas should be dumps.

9672782,story,,,1,1,manuisfunny,"What if Twitter had special accounts for politicians, restricting tweet delete?",,"1.  It could increase government transparency.  Most tweets that politicians want to deleted might just be spelling errors and social faux pas, there might be an occasional tweet where a politician slips up and tells the truth.<p>2.  No need to violate Twitter API terms and conditions caching/saving a politicians deleted tweets.<p>3.  It would be good PR for Twitter. It would help after canceling Politwoops` API access. This was because they had violated the API terms and conditions when they saved politician&#x27;s deleted tweets. If politicians can&#x27;t delete their tweets, there is no need to use the API to save/cache them.<p>4.  It might be easy to accomplish.  No one would take a politician&#x27;s side arguing against it. Politicians, who are elected officials, aren&#x27;t like the average citizen. They understand that they don&#x27;t have the same expectation of privacy as a normal citizen.<p>5.

The passenger compartment was bare bones -- no overhead vents, for example -- and I was in a pissy mood.  Allen was not.  He immediately struck me as the most seasoned, at ease traveller I had ever seen.  After he got himself adjusted I asked him if he travelled a lot.  He smiled and showed me his United frequent flyer card.  It had his name, and &quot;Five Million Miles&quot; embossed on it.  I asked him what the hell he was doing on this crappy America West flight.  He was flying from Geneva to his home in California, and had missed his connection, so United put him on the next available flight.<p>He was a &quot;CEO coach&quot; at the time and, while I normally don&#x27;t badger strangers on planes with questions, we ended up talking for a good part of the flight.  When his book came out, I recognised his picture on the jacket, and wrote him an email. He remembered me, and offered to get together for a glass of wine when he was in Boston.<p>Of course I got his book, and of course it changed my thinking.

The bottom banner is also an annoying distractionbut at least it&#x27;s relatively minor (compared to the lower-3rd monstrosities employed on entwork TV in particualr).<p>The problem with the lead-in video is <i>worse</i> than a TV commercial, IMHO. On TV you go to watch a program, and the ads are an annoyance but you wait for them to be over and then the program starts at a fixed time, if you&#x27;re not watching DVR, eg I usually watch a news program in the evening. But on YouTube, you make a selection of the video you want to watch next, and then <i>instead</i> some craptastic advert appears first. I don&#x27;t understand why advertisers think this is a good way to reach people; yes, you get their attention by appearing as a surprise, but now consumers associate the brand with concepts like <i>interruption</i> and <i>unmet expectations</i>, before they begin processing any of teh semantic content of the ad. I frequently don&#x27;t even notice what the ad is <i>for</i> because  after the initial annoyance, my attention is fixated on finding the Skip button and counting down the few seconds before I can click on it. Many ads haven&#x27;t introduced any product or branding by the time I skip away, and those which did so have already generated a reflexive mutter of &#x27;Fuck off, Brand_owner!&#x27;<p>Now that I mention this, just <i>thinking</i> about previous Youtube ad annoyances brings several specific brands to mind, brands which I would otherwise feel neutral about because I&#x27;ve never purchased any products from them. Instead they&#x27;re now firmly coupled with swear words. Think about that if you&#x27;re ever considering a video ad campaign; the people who click out early are probably not just disinterested, but may actively resent your brand and your campaign might result in a net loss of business.",1433633336

9672684,comment,9671066,9672254,0,0,david-given,,,"Ada&#x27;s contract stuff is a bit more sophisticated than a simple assertion. You can, for example, do this:<p><pre><code>    procedure increment(v: in out integer)\n    with\n      post => v /= v&#x27;old\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n(/= is Ada&#x27;s not-equal-to operator.) This enforces as a postcondition that the value of v must have changed. You can even refer to the old versions of arrays.<p>Plus, the run-time type checking required by more complex type expressions are augmented by compile-time checking. If the compiler can deduce that a conversion will always be correct, it won&#x27;t emit a check. If it can deduce that it will always be wrong, it&#x27;ll error out at compile time.<p>It all works really rather well.<p>The only trouble I have with preconditions and postconditions is that you have to declare them in your module&#x27;s interface, which is public, rather than in the module&#x27;s implementation, which isn&#x27;t. So you can only test your module&#x27;s public interface. If your module doesn&#x27;t expose a state variable to the outside world, you can&#x27;t use it in a precondition or postcondition. I find that a very odd design decision.",1433632370

As Henry Ford famously remarked, &quot;If I&#x27;d asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse.&quot;<p>This is the reception that innovators of all kinds get, and currently men&#x27;s dress is <i>incredibly</i> restricted. We aren&#x27;t quite stuck in Victorian days, but the diminishment of acceptable fashion choice for men in the past 200 years has been huge. In 1800 a man could still wear colourful clothing, jewelry, and makeup. Fifty years later, a man could wear clothes that would shock no-one if seen on the street today, and nothing else.<p>I don&#x27;t quite buy &quot;the Enlightenment&quot; as the whole answer, or even part of the answer, but there is no doubt that cultural shifts around that time had the effect of putting all men in uniform clothing. Think about that for a minute: women are allowed to wear almost anything today. Men are given a tiny number of acceptable choices, and no one much minds. I&#x27;m considered extravagant because I sometimes wear a bright red blazer to the theatre, which would be permitted if I were gay, but when I show up with my girlfriend it gets me insulted.<p>200 years ago men who were a hell of a lot more manly than me wore far more extravagant clothing and no one batted an eye (except maybe a few women who thought they were particularly attractive dressed like that.)<p>This is a lousy situation for straight men in the modern world: we deserve to be more than uniformed ciphers in the public eye, and rejecting society&#x27;s judgement of what looks nice is a necessary step to take, just as rejecting society&#x27;s judgement of what suitable entertainment is was necessary to the radio and film industry, rejecting society&#x27;s judgement of what suitable travel technology is was necessary to the automobile and aircraft industry was, and so on. And you better believe that conservatives were frequently strongly against those innovations as well.<p>Innovation is driven by people with the courage to reject society&#x27;s judgement and replace it with their own, and we should honour that courage, not denigrate it.",1433631967

I've even installed it a couple of times to see if the interface got any less ugly, but I decided against it because TextMate is equally powerful for my purposes, but requires no learning curve and no lengthy hacking sessions.<p>I use TextMate rather than Emacs for the same reason I use Mac OS X rather than Linux. Emacs and Linux may be more powerful, but TextMate and Mac OS X enable me to get what I want done with less fuss, less time expenditure, and less random jaunts through strange configuration files to figure out why feature XYZ doesn't work. I use TM/OSX because they Just Work.<p>I'm well aware of the additional power that I could have with Emacs or Linux, but it's not worth the additional hassle.<p>Also, before comparing TextMate to a GUI editor or IDE, you might want to actually try it. Sounds like you haven't TextMate is a programmer's power editor on a similar standing to vi or Emacs.

The grey ones look disabled, when they're the ones you want me to click on.<p>Also, I agree with others that the dollar amounts should be switched, and the first one should cost the most.  Do you label the shirt with the number (as in 1/100 like prints do)?  I think that would add value but it isn't clear to me if my run # will be on the shirt I buy. Update, now I see that it is on the shirt as shown in pictures #4 & #5 but you should definitely emphasize this A LOT more.  This is the reason someone would pay more when they don't have to.<p>I don't really like the red treatment.  Those are the instructions, not an error message.

(I like C-z bound to switch to shell and C-z in the shell to switch back.)<p>Also, since it's only been mentioned once or twice in this thread: Try re-mapping CapsLock to left control.[1] Ctrl is used quite a bit in Emacs, and often held down while navigating (loosely comparable to toggling modes via Escape in vi). You could also use right-ctrl with the side of your hand when using keys on the left side. People complain about ""Emacs Pinky"" from bending it down to Ctrl all the time over the years), so if it feels awkward you may want to move Ctrl.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/MovingTheCtrlKey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/MovingTheCtrlKey</a>",1214958052

You know why I'm here on news.yc in the first place? Because Philip Greenspun distracted me from grad school.<p>The entire point of grad school is the distractions. I learned this far too late, but at least I learned it.<p><i>Indiana's comp sci department has said that they cannot fund me for 2008-9...</i><p>Warning sign.<p><i>The professor at Indiana who I like is right now getting into the line of research that I want to pursue. Virtually everyone else to whom I've told this research idea to has said it's a terrible idea and can't work. This fellow ""gets it"". This year is probably the best time to get started on it, just as he is ramping up</i><p><i>Big</i> warning sign.<p>If you want to be a professor you need two things as you come out of grad school: A stellar recommendation letter from someone well established in the field [1], and the ability to get your grants funded. Working for a relatively new guy is dangerous, as is settling for a guy at a less-than-top-tier school -- his recommendations aren't worth as much. Going to work on a problem that most other profs think is a waste of time is <i>incredibly</i> foolish, because those other profs are the ones who will be reviewing your grant proposals and interviewing you for your next academic job. If everyone tells you up front that your idea won't work, and it doesn't (which is the most likely possibility), you won't exactly look like a genius. Even if your idea <i>does</i> work, many of those people won't get it. Or they might just refuse to listen to you out of spite. (If you think that can't happen because it would just be too petty and unfair, you know nothing about academia. ;)<p><i>I think professorship is really what I'm made for, and Indiana looks like the best path for that. That's the one place where I've met a professor who seems on my wavelength...</i><p>Wait -- you think being a prof is a good idea <i>despite</i> the fact that only one prof in the world seems to be on your wavelength?<p>Being a prof is entirely about making other profs happy so that they'll vote to give you funding. If you don't enjoy playing political games with other professors, you won't enjoy being a professor.<p><i>A master's degree from SFSU would likely lead straight to a Ph.D. from Berkeley or Stanford. And a Ph.D. from Berkeley or Stanford are better tickets to professorship at a research university than a Ph.D. from Indiana.</i><p>Amen. This is not only 100% correct, it's the most important factor by an order of magnitude.<p>If you seriously want to be a prof, <i>never</i> settle for a second-tier school so long as there are top-tier schools in the running. Berkeley or Stanford profs have better reputations, better connections, and better locations. Remember: academic hiring is more subjective than objective. It's as much about marketing, connections, and politics as it is about research talent and results, even if you're Knuth.<p>[1] Actually, you need <i>three</i> recommendation letters.

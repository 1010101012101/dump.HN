5541870,comment,5537024,5537024,1,0,lsiebert,,,"Edit: local college, not logical college.<p>Hi.  I volunteer at my local college as a Computer science Tutor.<p>Your teaching applied programming, so I would, unless it's a requirement, avoid most discussions of how things work, beyond the fact that the programming language is a way to write instructions that get the computer to do something.<p>I'd emphasize that loops, if/else, comparisons, boolean logic, arrays etc, are all composable, and you can build really complex things with them by combining them, just as you can build really complex equations by combining simple mathematical functions.<p>Then get them writing functions.  I'd introduce them to a function the first day, and explain that code is broken up into functions, because they are composable, testable, reusable, and allow the writer to focus on getting a specific task correct.<p>Get them printing stuff the first day, and reading input in from a file, not just a keyboard.  These are essential for any scientific work.  I'd provide ways to read in files of different formats... I'm not sure what computational biology generally uses, but you might want a csv and a plain text file.<p>I'd then do if/else which lets you talk about boolean logic.<p>Teach them about nested if statements.<p>Then I'd move on to loops and arrays.<p>Teach loops tied to arrays.  They are almost always used together anyway.  Teach multi dimensional arrays as arrays of arrays, generally gone through with nested loops.<p>Post useful code for them to download and read, with comments on what each line does. Challenge them to modify it to do something different but related.  Talk about how to debug code.<p>Talk about binary searches... I'd mention them first as a way to debug code, then introduce them later.<p>Show how to write function to find a minimum value in an array. Matlab probably has this, but show them it, because the fact that you initalize the comparison to first element and start comparing with the second, and not just initialize to 0 or something isn't obvious.  I often see people have this issue.<p>show how to write a function to exchange values, if that requires a temporary variable in matlab.<p>show them how you can put those functions together and make a simple sort.<p>The truth is that for most actual things they will do while working, until they understand MatLab well enough to write their own stuff, they will be googling code and modifying it, so get them in the habit of reading code to understand what is going on, and modifying it.<p>Teach them to comment their code.  Teach them to try to think about the steps involved before they code too much... try to get them writing down what they are going to do, and implementing it.<p>Oh and finally, have them write code, and then review it, or (easier for you) peer review it. Getting comments on code helps more then merely copying other's styles, because then they learn why you would do something.",1365811017

Even if jquery.com and all the CDN-hosted copies just fell off the face of the earth, you'd probably still have a dusty fork somewhere. Worse case: you go digging through your browser cache.<p>It's certainly good to know about the DOM and have some clue about what jQuery is doing, but getting to the point where you can switch to native DOM at will without losing any speed, just to say you can, seems like a textbook case of premature optimization. Do it if you're interested, but not to solve a business problem.<p>And remembering which browsers use textContent and which ones use innerText is not nearly as important as understanding that the DOM is there, what it does, and being able to use JavaScript to do things that jQuery doesn't have a method for.<p>In the unlikely case that the Internet explodes and changes such that jQuery is busted but your old DOM knowledge still applies, or you very quickly switch environments to something where it's not an option, what would you do? Well, jQuery was more or less a DOM replacement with some promises and stuff built in. You'd probably just write <i>that</i>. So why not skip the hassle and just stick to jQuery?

The problem is, how can we build a trusted history of accounting without knowing which nodes in the network are trustworthy. And the way Bitcoin does this is essentially by letting every miner vote with his CPU power and the history backed by the most computing power wins. Therefore as long as the majority of miners (weighted by their computing power) is honest, you can trust the accounting.<p>As to the question how Bitcoins come into existence, the miners are in control of the accounting and by design whoever ""finds a new block,"" is allowed to create some Bitcoins (currently 25) out of thin air. The advantage of this is, that even if some very large miner is considering that he could try a 50+1 % attack, he has a strong incentive to stay honest because that way he earns half of the newly mined Bitcoins.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance</a>",1365810282

A currency's real value is always moving relative to the underlying goods and services produced and exchanged in the economy - if it's not inflating, it's deflating, and it's never really standing still.<p>The key is a low volatility in that interest rate itself. The dollar's historical average inflation rate, since such records were kept, has been 3.35%-ish, and that rate has gotten much less volatile over time (e.g. 1920 saw monthly rates as high as +23% and 1921 saw rates as low as -15.8%).

He could have changed the game, by offering more than a wage, to give just one example, but he chose simply to pay as little as possible and to strictly minimize his short-term expenses and income at the expense of a robust economy. Many business owners happily draw a minimal wage as their business grows, knowing they want long term value in ownership.

It's not a commodity like gold - is is pure fiat money, fully based on trust. Hoarding gold or silver or any metal or rare thing was a bad idea because of the alternative uses which where then prevented.<p>There is nothing inherent to bitcoin that may hamper a ""country to convert a great part of this dead stock into active and productive stock"".<p>In fact, by reducing friction, making transaction costs almost negligible, it will help this very thing!<p>How could Adam Smith may have hated something that did not exist back then, and that many economists had previously advocated for - a single worldwide fiat currency.<p>The only real problem is for governments, who won't be able to use the seignorage tax anymore, ie inflation, ie printing money out of thin air at the detriment of currency owners, to coerce people to do things or lose money.<p>Bitcoin is a game changer, the end of a tyranny - the use of force to make people work, instead of being able to live with what they have without the fear that the government will decide to reduce the purchasing power of what one owns by 20% overnight, through inflation or plain just stealing (as in Cyprus) to ""transfer that wealth"", reverse Robin Hood style, to their well connected and too big to fall fat-cat friends.<p>Also, it's quite fun that a system based on trust, of the people, by the people, is not trusting the government. It's something the founding fathers would certainly be quite proud of :-)<p>EDIT: And to those who argue the amount of computing power and electricity to run the bitcoin network is insane, just think for a second about Moore law, or how much GDP goes to the finance sectors. IIRC it is around 10%. That sure is a whole lot of money for the simple job of allocating resources (currency, saving, investment, transaction, etc).<p>It seems ripe for disruption.<p>A bitcoin economy will be able to do the same job for a fraction of these cost, thus allowing capital to be best spent on other uses (say actually advancing technology, or building real stuff) ie human capital and physical capital, which according to mainstream economic growth theory (from Solow to Romer) is essential for economic growth - real economic growth.<p>If you have some data and some time to spend, draw a graph of the log of gdp per capital and the percentage of the gdp spend on the finance sector. You'll see a strange recent trend - less growth, and more gdp for the finance sector. I'm not arguing a causation, but that's some food for throughts.<p>Just like Gandhi say - first they ignore you, then they fight you, then you win. We are currently at step #2.

Every transaction in the system is stored in a chain of blocks.  These blocks are created whenever someone discovers the answer to a very hard mathematical problem. When they do this, the new block is created, and that block contains all the transactions that were done since the last block was created.  To make the next block, you have to have the previous block, so the entire chain of blocks can be authenticated, thus the entire history of transactions can be authenticated.<p>As a reward for securing the system in this way, that is, providing a secure distributed transaction history, the miners are rewarded with some bitcoins whenever they discover a new answer and create a new block.<p>Thus they are providing the security of the system and as a reward are given bitcoins.  To keep the rate of new blocks contstant, the difficulty of the mathematical problem is adjusted up and down. Over time, the number of bitcoins you get for finding a new solution will diminish to zero.<p>To keep miners finding new answers, even after the reward in BTC hits zero (in the year 2140) the system has transaction fees.  These are an incentive to keep finding blocks, and the person who finds the next block gets the fees for the transactions that go into that block.<p>Since blocks are discovered once every 10 minutes, you'd get 10 minutes worth of fees for the whole system-- which could be quite a bit in the future.",1365809253

Or maybe the idea didn't sink in until he heard it twice.<p>Getting attention in a meeting where several loud confident people are pontificating can be difficult if you are not a loud, self-confident person, or if they don't already respect you.<p>But I don't think the OP needed to escalate to crack pipes right away, although it's a great line. A ""Guys, we don't use type-two data!"" loud enough to be heard over everybody else's voices and repeated until it worked probably would have done the trick without affecting perf scores. It depends on the culture of the group. There is usually some accepted way in a group to interrupt conversations that are going nowhere. My guess is that anyone would have been dinged by that boss for the crack comment, just because that's his way of dealing with things.<p>Also, filling unappreciated and oppressed can become a self-fulfilling prophesy in men as well as women. If you go in there unsure they will pay attention to you, they probably won't. If you go in there thinking, ""I'm not going to say much, but when I do, they had better pay attention, because I know what I'm talking about,"" they will sense it and listen, no matter who you are.<p>One thing I think isn't understood by the women who post things like this is that men are always in competition. It's like a wolf pack where a pecking order must be established.<p>In any meeting some guys who are trying to be alpha are going talk over or ignore other people they perceive as beneath them, or who they want to put beneath them, men as well as women. It's not a gender thing as much as it's a power thing. The way to overcome it is stand up for yourself and to establish your competence in whatever the group respects whether it be fisticuffs in the Army or technical skill in a company.<p>I suspect that the crack pipes remark, coupled with her obviously correct understanding of the problem at hand, won her respect points with her co-workers that will make them more likely to listen to her later on, no matter what the boss thought.<p>In the same way, having her opinion confirmed by another respected person probably made the coworker in the second example more likely to accept her opinion without confirmation the next time.<p>Basically, nobody gets respect right away. It doesn't come with a title, or even because you are a man. If you don't have the type of personality that immediately commands respect, you'll have to earn it step-by-step. Even if you do immediately command it, you can lose it very quickly if you don't show yourself worthy of it.<p>Also men test each other and especially newcomers by teasing or pointed jokes. The ability to ""take a joke"" is highly respected. It's not an attractive trait, but it happens. You can just ignore it (recommended), or you can do it better than they do. Depends on your personality. It usually stops after a while. Complaining about it usually makes it worse. In one sense, if men are doing this to a woman among them, it means they have accepted her to some extent. Now all she has to do is start working her way up the pecking order.

Regarding the first one, I was made senior when I was very young, having clients and even certain co-workers at the time respect my opinion was very tough. I got where I was in no small part because of my hard work and my choices, and that was pretty frustrating at first.<p>The other issues I think are relatively common and apply to most people, at least at some point in their careers. Having constructive arguments and listening to others' is a pretty rare skill, generally speaking.<p>Now the article seems to present these issues as if they were solely caused by misogyny. I think it's more about general stereotyping, but also about affected people not knowing how to stand their ground. I got pushed around and ignored for a while, like most people will endure at some point. Getting bitter won't resolve anything, it'll just give people around you a wrong justification for their behavior, making you even more frustrated and bitter.<p>Standing your ground in my opinion is being able to show you didn't get where you are by mistake. And if you happen to be the victim of stereotyping or any kind of discrimination, making a firm point of it will make people think that's all you're about, not your skills or your hard work. It's sad but I guess you can only rise above the bickering, and that in itself can be quite empowering.<p>And if that sort of behavior is common-place in your workplace (as opposed to isolated in which case simply ignoring it works wonders), then you most definitely aren't working for the right people. I despise ignorant discrimination but I can't support people who make it the source of all their problems either.",1365807923

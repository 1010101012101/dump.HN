Sure, everyone has spare power supplies and SD cards knocking around, but maybe not a spare video lead, keyboard, mouse, whatever is needed for the project.

If you&#x27;ve been considering trying Julia out but were worried that it was moving too fast (it&#x27;s been moving pretty fast), this is a good time to try it out. Not only will the 0.2 release line be supported with minimally invasive bugfixes, but also the 0.3 release is going to largely consist of performance improvements.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-users/-lh_g9eH4bk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-users/-lh_g9eH...</a>",1384709975

The fact is that violence on the scale of the Holocaust is scarily common throughout human history. The thing that is most special about it however is its ghastly efficiency, ideology, and modernity. It wasn&#x27;t the scale of it, 30 million people died on the eastern front, and millions more were raped and terrorized in the territories it covered. It was the character of the Holocaust, its ghastly efficiency and modernity, that makes it so remembered today.<p>Additionally, in the western wold there is a large population of holocaust survivors keeping the memory alive. There are no currently living Congolese who were alive under King Leopold&#x27;s reign around today, and their descendants do not have much of a voice in the western world either.<p>An extreme example of this indifference to things happening far away and long ago is the wars of the ancient world, where the brutality is rarely spoken of today. For instance, the fall of Carthage in the 3rd punic war, wherein the Romans literally destroyed the entire city and killed the vast majority of the entire population, some 445,000 people, a truly massive city in the ancient world.",1384709962

The model I&#x27;ve found most immediately applicable is:<p><pre><code>            Extroverted\n\n                 |\n</code></pre>\nPerson focused ----- Task focused<p><pre><code>                 |\n\n            Introverted\n</code></pre>\nYou can pick up on that sort of thing fairly easily, when people speak how loudly do they speak - do they project their voice? When they talk do they gesture a lot with their hands? When they talk is about things or people? Does their tone of voice alter when they talk about different areas - do the volunteer information as readily about those things, ask the same number of relevant questions?",1384709808

But if we&#x27;re going with my example of eight permissions, then you probably have 24+ calls in various places in your code, some of which relying on others.<p>Catching the error isn&#x27;t even half the battle, either. If you want the app to &quot;work,&quot; you need to explicitly test the full set of permissions any particular block of code might need prior to <i>enabling</i> aspects of your UI that require them, or your app is going to behave badly.<p>At best, your proposed solution would prevent the app from <i>crashing</i>, though it could still get into a bad state -- a non-modal dialog waiting for a particular result could never be closed, for example, because of an unexpected throw that skipped over the proper cleanup code.

Some apps really don&#x27;t work without certain permissions (say an Internet chat app with no INTERNET permission), so be sure you have reasonable error messages that explain to the user that the app can&#x27;t work if you don&#x27;t give it the right permission. And word the message so that your average non-techie will understand it, or be prepared for lots of negative ratings with &quot;app doesn&#x27;t work! uninstalled!&quot; comments.<p>No, making it easy for people to kill permissions on an app is the wrong answer.

The biggest issue that seems to still remain is that you can&#x27;t change rounding modes or check flags, both of which are essential for verifying numerical stability and correctness. Far worse than any floating-point issues on the JVM is that your indices and integers are 32-bit, so you&#x27;re limited to 2GB arrays before you have to take bizarre measures to access larger amounts of data.<p>Although it is standard in high-level systems to call out to a BLAS library [1], for some inexplicable reason it seems that both R and NumPy use the reference BLAS by default, which is quite slow around 4x slower than better BLASes. Matlab ships with Intel&#x27;s proprietary MKL, which includes a very fast BLAS implementation, while Julia ships with OpenBLAS, which is a similarly fast open source BLAS implementation derived from the legendary GotoBLAS [2]. Since all BLAS implementations share a common Fortran ABI, it&#x27;s easy to swap them out, but it&#x27;s not quite true that all of these systems are using the exact same Fortran code.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprogra...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GotoBLAS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GotoBLAS</a>",1384708323

6749635,comment,6745525,6746098,1,0,xpda,,,"Google search has become fuzzier over recent years. When I look for something technical, I almost always have to go back and put quotes around the terms, because Google prefers to display a different search for more common, related terms.<p>This brings up the Google Interface. I used to be able to use + in front of a term I wanted to be treated literally. Now I have to use quotes, which is 4 keystrokes (including shift) instead of 1 for plus.<p>Google also has removed my ability to block certain URLs from your search results. Now I cannot avoid the re-linker web sites, and occasionally get suckered into clicking one. That is really irritating.<p>In spite of this, Google still provides the best search I&#x27;ve seen. I recently compared Google and Bing in an obscure search. Google had 45 hits, Bing 15.",1384707786

And that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s illegal, immoral or life threatening. One day you&#x27;ll have something to hide and realize how naive this thought process is.

There are too many examples of people <i>being killed</i> for expressing their views.<p>Freedom of speech comes with the cost of hearing things we might not want to hear at times.

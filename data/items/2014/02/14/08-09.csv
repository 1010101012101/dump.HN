I honestly don&#x27;t know how to initiate a rational discussion of the issue.  And I <i>especially</i> suspect that the side that immediately dismisses any other line of thinking by calling names as loudly as possible does so to cover weaknesses in their argument.<p>It&#x27;s not that I have it in for gays; rather, it&#x27;s that no one&#x27;s ever explained to me the argument for why the gay rights movement is a Good Thing, in a way that I find convincing.  Based on my own analysis, it seems to be a weak position [1] -- perhaps not one which should be adopted, and certainly not an axiom which is beyond reproach or questioning of assumptions.  And I&#x27;m a stubborn, independent thinker -- as a matter of principle, I refuse to believe something simply because it&#x27;s popular among the crowd I hang out with -- or because one side has declared the opposition to be heretics.  (Fun thought experiment:  s/bigot/heretic/)<p>[1] Basically, I think our society should treat homosexuality / bisexuality as it treats adultery -- nobody goes to jail or gets their life destroyed as long as any sexual activity involves only consenting adults.  But it&#x27;s a lifestyle choice that people should disapprove of, not least because it&#x27;s disruptive to the family structure consisting of children raised by two parents of opposite sex in a committed relationship, which -- all else being equal -- is the best environment for a child to grow up in.  Also, I&#x27;m skeptical of the claim that homosexuality is not a choice -- if a person doesn&#x27;t choose who they have sex with, why is rape a crime?<p>I&#x27;m certain many readers will object to the above, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get someone to make a cogent argument that actually addresses my points; everyone just screams &quot;DIE IN A FIRE&quot; at the top of their lungs at me when I bring this up in a liberal place like HN.",1392366402

Once China or Korea is good enough to copy their products, they lose their marketability because they lack any edge that would bring more value to their product. Sony in its whole was a huge FAIL: they had so many different divisions focusing on hifi, electronics and computing and they never could make any sense on how to make all this products branded as Sony work better together.

Once a population group got large enough to have to worry about silly things like common property it ended up having leaders/warlords (either homegrown or due to conquest from abroad).<p>Is there any evidence that humans <i>ever</i> weren&#x27;t large enough to worry about common property?  I mean populations evolve, not individuals, right?  And even families have common property within the household, right?  If humans are social creatures, then it seems to me that this view of history can&#x27;t be right because humans have always formed governments as required by our social nature.<p>> But even so, you certainly saw it in recorded history when government was weaker. &quot;Highwayman&quot; used to connote a very scary idea, something that is most relevant in modern history to those driving in convoys in Afghanistan or Iraq.<p>But bandits have almost always been a reaction to the formation (often by distinct government policies) of a destitute class.  You see a major increase in banditry following the confiscation of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, for example, because this was instrumental in creating the destitute masses that would power the English Industrial Revolution.<p>The FLN is a good example of the use of a war of all against all as a tactic to weaken governments.  I don&#x27;t think it is a good example of what happens without strong government though.  A much better example would be blood feuds in medieval Iceland, or in weak government areas today.<p>Blood feuds though are complex institutions.  They don&#x27;t really form a war of all against all.  Rather they form a way for bad behavior to be punished.  If a man in Papua feels that his wife has dishonored him and kills her, her brothers will likely do the same to him.  This will spin around until everyone gets tired of it and decides to reconcile with some sort of settlement.<p>As Jesse Byock has pointed out, one can see significant evidence that in medieval Iceland, the blood feud was an institution which provided a similar form of social control and stabilization to what we might think of as law and order.

What&#x27;s wrong is that every line is correct but because of the mutable store, the program as a whole is incorrectly typed.<p>The solution is to generalize only a subset of all syntactic constructs. The historic solution in Ocaml is to never generalize expressions that may allocate memory (that&#x27;s the &quot;value restriction&quot;) . For example, a function application (like f x, or ref []) may allocate, but a variable or a constant (like x or 1 or []) can not. That&#x27;s why [] has type &#x27;a list but ref [] has type &#x27;_a list ref (&#x27;_a can be unified only once, so in the above example an error would occur at the &quot;let n&quot;).",1392364955

Even the largest asteroids can be easily excavated right down to the core, and many of them contain a wide abundance of many metals, basically everything from Lithium to Copper to Nickel to Platinum or Iridium. With low gravity and 24/7 in situ solar power any reasonable separation technology can just be let loose and given time to work. Near Earth orbit there&#x27;s more than 10 gigajoules of energy available per year per square meter from solar power, and that includes factoring in the efficiency of conversion.",1392364896

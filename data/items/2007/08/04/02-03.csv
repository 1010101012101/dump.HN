I don't know if Digg was ever as interesting, but the two aren't too dissimilar now. You could have also urged this not become like any of thousands of flaming forums.<p>I is clear the news.yc community is becoming stronger and more solidified. Hopefully, the small subset of news it is attacking will limit the size and audience to only the most thoughtful. My guess is that you'll have to do more than pleas like this to ensure that.",1186195628

Instead to focus on writing interesting articles for their blogs this users will spend all the day visiting analytics, feedburner, sending messages in twitter about new services, reading tons of RSS, ...<p>Fortunately there is a parallel web 2.0 market of valuable things that save our time and make our life better. Developers seeking for a real business in the last years should look at this.<p>It is also very important to try to improve over the useful things already released.

39225,comment,38829,39221,0,0,palish,,,"The word ""copying"" works if it's not illegal, but it is.  You have to say ""illegal copying"" for accuracy.<p>Let's look at it from another angle.  Let's say someone paints a nice painting of a hand scrunching up a piece of cloth.  If you think about it, an original painting is a form of artificial DRM.  It's artificially more valuable than a copy, which causes implicit DRM.<p>But let's say it wasn't.  For whatever reason, people just didn't feel like the originals were worth paying for.  What do the artists do who want to make a living that way, if they're not good at other skills yet?  Maybe they've devoted their whole life to painting.  It puts a lot of creative people out of business for no good reason.  It's not because their work isn't valuable, it's just because people can copy it. <p>Do you think they should be protected?",1186195051

After all, all people are sometimes irrational, no one is always irrational, and some people are never rational. It's just a numbers game.\n",1186194509
39221,comment,38829,39209,0,0,pg,,,"The difference is that the instance of the chair cost Wal-Mart money.  <p>Imagine if you had a machine that could reproduce something from a photograph of it.  You could then go to a shop and take a photo of a chair, and reproduce yourself a chair from it.  But the shop wouldn't take an actual loss in that case.  <p>There's nothing gray about that difference.  If you steal a chair, the value of their inventory decreases by one chair, and if you merely reproduce one from a photo, it remains the same.<p>Nor do we need to make up a new word for the behavior.  The English word is ""copying.""  It's centuries old at least, and the behavior, in the case of manuscripts, goes back millennia.<p>So I'm not proposing we use a new word to make everyone feel better.  I'm proposing we continue to use the existing word, instead of the one the music industry is trying to get us to switch to to make everyone feel worse.",1186194341

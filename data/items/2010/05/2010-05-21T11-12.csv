The problem is that <i>most</i> people who think they can do it, can't. That is, most professionals will take on more challenging problems than they are practically qualified for. If the bulk of an industry can't judge its own competence, customers and courts have no chance of doing so. And yet this is increasingly a requirement for doing business at all. You can't simply tell people to stop using computers.<p>If you can't define ""reasonable"" for the purposes of writing a law, it's a good indication that people won't know what it means when they try to obey the law. You can't make laws that nobody knows how to follow.",1274442967

I laughed for about an hour.<p>Then I realized that I hadn't laughed or smiled at web content in quite some time.<p>So today's topic: humorous nerdy phrases on T-shirts -- of interest to hackers or not?<p>I think humor and light-heartedness is very interesting and also good for you. I just posted ""Nerdy Cute Girls. In T-Shirts"" and it was deleted within minutes. There was no nudity, no profanity. It was just funny nerd jokes on shirts with cute girls under them.<p>Now I could give a shit whether HN wants to delete this post or not, and I really don't want to promote myself in those keyword areas, but the post wasn't controversial or off-topic. Lame and trivial, perhaps. But fuck dudes, there are a zillion lame and trivial posts every day. Just don't upvote them. Instead I got the immediate ""what is this? Reddit?"" (Which I thought was hilarious in itself actually. I could just picture some overly-serious internet curmudgeon banging away the required response)<p>So what do you guys say? Can we share jokes and light-heartedness every now and then as long as we identify in the title what it is? Or would the presence of jokes derail the community forever and lead us down a path of wanton banality?<p>I know the standard response. I'm just thinking that I've become much less happy over the last two years, and hanging out in a joke-free zone with a bunch of Mr. Spock wannabes might be part of that.<p>So while I understand the theory in ""no jokes"" I wonder what the long-timers think of the effect on them after a while. For those of you wanting to psychoanalyze me, probably a more useful response would be to post some links for receiving tech humor on a daily basis. This not only makes you look like less of a jerk, it helps other people with similar questions.<p>What do you guys think?",1274442723

And it's actually quite a lot of fun to experiment with something fundamental to well-being.<p>I currently take a multivitamin, Omega 3, 600mg calcium + 400 IU Vit D, plus 6000IU of D separately, and variable amounts of whey protein. The multi is an all-arounder, the Omega 3 is for perceived brain power benefits. I go for a lot of Vit D because it's just been amazing for mood, confidence, general well-being, and I started with the calcium to complement it. The whey protein is used to keep me on the straight-and-narrow with the rest of my diet, by controlling hunger in a form which offers few obvious downsides.<p>As far as brands go, I typically get supplements either from Trader Joe's or from CVS. I don't really pay much attention to which ones I'm using as I haven't seen a quality difference yet. I've been going through some Omega 3 from Trader Joe's for ages, no problems with it.

I mean, I love the guy-- read his site every day, as I think it is some of the best Apple analysis out there-- but as Google I/O has gone on, his normally cogent commentary has degenerated into what basically amounts to one-line (or one-paragraph) sniping over Google's attempts to challenge Apple. As if Apple somehow has the right to complete 100% dominance of the consumer smartphone market.<p>The thing about all that to me is the way he's been almost intentionally been obtuse about some things in order to snark about them. He's been conflating the difference between private system APIs and undocumented application APIs on Android lately, even after acknowledging a response from Tim Bray about the whole thing a couple of weeks ago.<p>Andy Rubin made a comment a while back about how Google doesn't use private APIs in Android, and Gruber's just been chomping at the bit to somehow use this as an example of Google's hypocrisy. So when Google says something like ""You really shouldn't be doing things like accessing the SMS app's internal undocumented methods because there's no guarantee they'll be there on all distributions of Android"" [because the SMS app is just another application and not a core system component], Gruber jumps up and down pointing at it as an example of how Google lied about not using private APIs.<p>Maybe it's just me, but telling developers that they should stick to public system level APIs rather than try to muck around with the internals of applications <i>that aren't a part of the core system</i> hardly sounds like some tacit admission that Google is really using private APIs on the sly to me. Google's entire point about private APIs is that you can do anything you see a Google app do using the public system APIs because that's what the Google apps are using in the first place, rather than relying on hidden systems calls that aren't made available to normal developers.<p>It's frustrating, because when Gruber is right, his analysis is usually a great read (plus I love Markdown). But lately he's been fanboying so hard on this and a couple of other things that it's gotten painful for me to follow him.",1274439891

Because the keys on the keyboard did not match what you got when you pressed them - Dvorak forced me to touch type - which I hadn't been able to do on querty (or rather quertz) for lack of pressure.<p>Now I am much better at querty and Dvorak.  You do not unlearn the old layout.  In fact I find that I can alternate between both layouts as fast as I can tell the computer to switch.  (I assigned the windows-key for switching.)",1201549309

105703,comment,105540,105540,0,0,sanj,,,"This article is important, but seems a little technically sloppy.  The issue isn't about autoincremented IDs, but the fact that they are used as external identifiers.  The specific reason they shouldn't be used is that they are guessable.<p>It also confuses the concept of a GUID a little, I think.  That refers to a global UID, which could reasonably be a URL+autoincremented number: global and unique.<p>But guessable.  Which is the core issue.<p>I try to consider external IDs like passwords: create a cryptographically strong hash, using some salt, and externalize that.",1201546921

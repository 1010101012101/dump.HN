I might see 25 different kinds of Colgate, and 1 kind of Crest. Personally, I&#x27;d likely buy the Crest, because I can&#x27;t decide between all the Colgate options of Ultrabrite, Optic White, Sparkling White,  Sensitive, Sensitive Pro-Relief, Max Fresh, 2in1, Cavity Protection, Total, Total Advanced, Total Action, and Triple Action (these are all real names, and they have more).<p>You&#x27;re saying I should see 26 individual options to compare and be overwhelmed with choice. However, if I buy Crest, I&#x27;m happy. This is because I trust their knowledge of toothpaste over my own, and pass the decision making to them. I assume their single option has the best formula. If I choose between Ultrabrite, Sparkling White and Optic White from Colgate, I&#x27;m less satisfied, because I&#x27;m unsure if I made the right choice, because I don&#x27;t have a PhD in toothpaste.<p>This is no different than software.

Logically, this means they would be most satisfied and happy if they didn&#x27;t have to make <i>any</i> choices or do any thinking at all, and something/someone else made all the decisions for them - the equivalent of having no freedom or control over one&#x27;s life. Is this really what we want society to become?<p>&quot;Making choices is hard, so just give up&quot;? To me, that&#x27;s where it looks like things are heading, and quite frankly it&#x27;s a rather disturbing trend.

That assumption is obviously wrong, there are many public incidents that show that the core signing keys of pretty much any &#x27;trusted organization&#x27; can be used by three letter agencies to sign malicious code as, say, valid windows updates; and that both hardware and OS should be assumed to contain backdoors - especially in the TPM chain.<p>In addition, having a true and valid hash of my OS, software and config doesn&#x27;t give you any true assurance - a security hole in that software or OS can easily give an ability to execute arbitrary code, so the &quot;proper configuration&quot; can behave in whatever way, despite being verified. That&#x27;s what I meant by saying that you can&#x27;t be sure if it&#x27;s not doing anything bad, even if you completely control the node - if the underlying math ensures that reading or altering X isn&#x27;t possible, then it&#x27;s okay; but otherwise you have to hope/trust that it doesn&#x27;t.

8124720,comment,8124027,8124634,5,0,plam3ns,,,"Of course I might fail to understand the reason :)<p>First - OM is licensed under GPL (see their website). While the word &quot;open&quot; in the context of GPL can be discutable depending on the view of the gp, that&#x27;s not a fault of LispWorks.<p>Second - if not the GPL has been the confusion in the gp, then - to run AND develop for OM no one needs a commercial license of LispWorks (the runtime/compiler/lister/editor are distributed with OM). A professional tool like LispWorks is needed only to recompile OM itself, which is so or so not a hurdle for the gp until he doesn&#x27;t gain enough knowledge about and experience with OM AND Common Lisp. By the time he gets there, I&#x27;m sure - he will either decide that neither OM or Lisp are his things and then again the license is irrelevant - or he will decide to pursue that path in which case the costs for LW are a bargain in comparison to the value one gets. If not OM, but Lisp seems to be something for him at the end - even then he can choose from about a dozen different implementations with different licensing terms from GPL though Open Source up to licenses for tens of tausends per CPU per year.<p>Third - &quot;open&quot; can be a bit ladden with &quot;free&quot;, but it can mean also an &quot;open architecture&quot; or a &quot;development of software open to the public&quot; or whatever. Again - not reading what is written on the website of the OM creators doesn&#x27;t do good to the gp.<p>Last - if you or gp mean that one has to bite in every carrot with an engraved &quot;free&quot; on it is serious then... :)<p>But I started with the idea to help the gp to look deeper before using strong language and less to continue bashing on soft reasoning.<p>Peace and regards",1406981364

If color had a different name, and was written by a small hardy team from y combinator or whatever, I think people who have still had some scepticism but would have been generally positive.<p>I, like a lot of people, looked at that app and thought, ""this is $41M of development?"".<p>They can still pivot and do something interesting, but I think this is one of those times that ""release early, release often"" does not apply.

This results in several things the first being no guaranteed terminator in which you have to have a catch all pattern to clean up the trash, the catch all's are not ideal for two reasons both related to the fact that it has to be time based (relying on timing in an none timed operation usually indicates you are doing something very wrong). Anyways if you get the timeout too short you kill the users session and have to create even more workflow to get them back to where they where (if you can). If you get the timeout too long you end up eating up too many server resources. I have seen it happen time and time again as soon as an app starts to experience some load as it grows the teams first reaction is to tighten the session timeout, if a teams first course of action to a scalability issues is to tighten there session timeout, they are in real trouble if they get hit with fast growth.<p>Session is inherently more difficult to scale horizontally, it creates the need for memory replicator routines or homegrown solutions of syncing all sessions to a DB and replicating it on other boxes. This creates complex infrastructure dependencies that have to be accounted for when you have to scale horizontally again.<p>As well, developers tend to, over time, uses session as a dumping ground, if they need to carry the shopping cart to the next page they just dump the whole 10 megs of data into the session, there is no way (without setting up monitors) to enforce that session is not becoming bloated.<p>We had a guy one time dump a 200 meg object in session for ever user (it was 1 years availability for ever hotel in North America). He needed one days data for the confirmation and the user might adjust the dates so he just stuck it in session.<p>Further, session being a grab bag and global in scope means that even when an object no longer has any reference session still has a reference to it so it just sits there pollution memory. So in essence session creates all the same problems that global variables caused, global variables are considered bad practice these days because of those scoping problems. Some developers get lazy and when they do session is a big lazy enabler.<p>Contrast these with a stateless patterns and it becomes far more simple, users never time out, so you can pick up an operation 4 days from now, the client holds all of the information to pick up the transaction where it left off. As well since the client and server transfer state between each other scaling horizontally becomes simply an exercise of installing the app on another box and adding it to the route table on a round robin load balancing strategy.<p>And that is the crux of the issue, session is great when you are building an app that sees no load, so developers write an app that relies on session when they are starting out, it gets them in the mentality of using session so when it does start getting load they are already in the session mentality, so instead of taking a critical look and saying we need to get this app stateless so we can quickly scale horizontally, they stay in the session mentality and start designing solutions to replicate memory, store session in databases and other suck solutions that cure the symptoms. That is usually the beginning of a long painful process that finally end in statelessness.",1301315863

All other support must happen outside the tree and therefore all the work has to be done by the special interest groups.<p>I don't want to say we follow all these points perfectly, but for a big project glibc certainly comes closest to this. The only OSes supported in the tree are Linux and to some extend Hurd. The latter is certainly not a preferred target and does not hold back the development by requesting that no patch breaks the Hurd configuration. The supported architectures in the tree has been cut and probably should be cut even more. Only the architectures which are regularly tested (since they are supported in the various enterprise Linux distributions) are maintained plus a few historically supported architectures. The latter group should be cut down to the minimum. No global edits for the tree are required, they are voluntarily. I.e., fixing configurations which are negatively impacted by a patch is the duty of the people with interest in the configuration. All other configurations are maintained (or not) outside the tree. People can decide to use this additional repository at compile time to get access to the additional configurations. Nobody is robbed of the freedom but the costs are distributed fairly.<p>For my new projects the razor is even sharper. Only Linux is supported and only the few interesting mainstream architecture with reasonable APIs are maintained. Support for architectures with deliberately different APIs (i.e., IA-64) can be contributed. No other configuration is supported, actively or not, and people would have to exercise their right to add patches or fork the entire code to add other support.<p>IMO this is the only viable development model to allow free software to succeed since the remaining projects are huge in size and need concentrated efforts not diluted by diverging interests caused by a myriad of configurations.""</i><p>Can't say I agree, but I can see his point to a certain degree.

Even in real-world personal interactions, identity assurance is subject to a leap of faith (""I <i>believe</i> this person is who they say they are based on the evidence <i>they</i> presented""). As such, is this problem even solvable? People rely on a much less stringent level of assurance to create secure connections on the Internet, because they want it handled within a single mouse click, and that expectation isn't going to change.<p>At least with a certificate issued by the registrar, there's some logical reason to believe that it was issued to whoever purchased the domain (whoever <i>that</i> is), which is often enough to establish an encrypted connection at a level the user expects. Significant problems remain, however: 1) Most domain owners have no idea how to generate a key and CSR (the registrar shouldn't do it) and 2) a truly reliable system for certificate revocation must exist to handle domain transfers. These aren't new problems, they just don't go away by shifting to this ""easier"" approach.",1301314059

The nice part is that they can provide third party authorization as well.<p>Session creates so many anti-patterns that it is no wonder that traditional web 1.0 development is in the state it is in. There are a multitude of other solutions out there that provide very clean stateless programming patterns.<p>The problem with session is that once a developer falls on it as a crutch it begins to be used for all manner of bad  programming habits.<p>Sun had a very good product called OpenSSO that did stateless authentication and authorization unfortunately it was one of the project Oracle killed off.",1301313903

2378020,comment,2376431,2376431,3,0,Nelson69,,,"I'll chime in on this..   Some buddies and I have been debating this  since the comodo stuff first started leaking out.<p>First off,  there is a different sort of modern attack that's far worse than most others, and it's attacking the trust model.   TLS and PKI hasn't been broken, the way it is used and managed has raised some questions though.   The thing that can happen here,  a lot of people will just jump ship on it all (and quite honestly, there isn't an alternative right now, the alternative is no security) and that's   not good.   This is happening a couple different ways,  first people don't understand it, second people are raising fears over foreign CAs being included in browsers and OSes.<p>It seems like the bigger problem to me is that PKI is a dynamic system and the implementations are all static.  When a web site is authenticated, the browser could establish a connection to the CA provide, signed by another CA even, and  check to see if it has been revoked, if it has been signed, etc..    It could actually verify the third party authentication, live in real-time.  To fake a site you'd need to compromise 2 different CA's in that case.   And revocation certificates could be sent and honored, in real-time.<p>It seems to me like it's all rooted in the pay for security model.    CAs need to verify each other and the distribution of a new CA needs to be  a fairly steep and difficult thing to do  (not impossible, but maybe face-to-face contact is required) and any hint of mis-use needs to result in revocation.",1301313675

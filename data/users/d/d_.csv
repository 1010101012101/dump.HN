To have his company's vision still controlled by himself and the CMO.  When the end of the quarter is approaching to not sacrifice long term goals for short term gains.  This means a dangerous and daring path of balancing consumer desires, features, competition time lines, and investors.<p>Startrek.  Wouldn't it be amazing to have a computer which could interface with any device?  To get there, however, we need some significant improvements in hardware development.  I find a few more challenges when dealing with hardware start ups then the software projects I have worked on in the past.  The main difference is Money.  As a software developer you can work fairly cheaply and get a user base before needing massive investment to upgrade those servers.  As a Hardware company you need that money before you can establish a user base.  This difference directly correlates to hardware developers getting their hands tied before their vision is complete.  I will found my company, and OWN it.  In the process I will provide models on how to avoid getting tangled by the investment web before the developer is ready.<p>I will explore new dynamics for company models.\nI will seek out new forms of investment.\nI will boldly go where business folk have doubted I could go alone.\nI will start this company.",1223851060,1452886608

Packagepeer covers the entire process through its website where both types of users, the online buyers and receivers, are registered and put in contact with each other. Once the contact is made and found suitable, the user can access the packagepeer’s details to use them as the delivery address when purchasing online. Then, online shoppers can pick up their goods from their neighbor’s house at their most convenient time and pay a small fee in turn for their neighbor’s service.",1428577245,1453168498

darien,0,282,2.0,10,87,"27, Web Analyst for Conde Nast and sometimes Reddit.<p><i>the best way to encourage (or to have) new ideas isn&#x27;t to fetishise the &quot;spark of genius&quot;, to retreat to a mountain cabin in order to &quot;be creative&quot;, or to blabber interminably about &quot;blue-sky&quot;, &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; thinking. Rather, it&#x27;s to expand the range of your possible next moves - the perimeter of your potential - by exposing yourself to as much serendipity, as much argument and conversation, as many rival and related ideas as possible; to borrow, to repurpose, to recombine. This is one way of explaining the creativity generated by cities, by Europe&#x27;s 17th-century coffee-houses, and by the internet. Good ideas happen in networks; in one rather brain-bending sense, you could even say that &quot;good ideas are networks&quot;. Or as Johnson also puts it: &quot;Chance favours the connected mind.&quot;</i>\n(http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/oct/19/steven-johnson-good-ideas)",1251659620,1452888316

I&#x27;m a co-founder of Neosupport, which makes calculator apps using our Calcapp platform (www.calcapp.net). Our customers are in the healthcare industry at present, but we&#x27;re starting to branch out. In the near future, we&#x27;d like to reach all those Excel users that create spreadsheets heavy on calculations and that are intended to be used by others and have them use our forthcoming cloud-based calculator app builder instead (Calcapp Creator). Spreadsheets like that tend to break easily -- when users change the wrong cells -- and do not work well on mobile devices. Apps, of course, are not afflicted with those problems and we&#x27;d like to make them as easy to create as possible.",1386354502,1450207814

I&#x27;ve been close to fluent in: APL, Basic, Z80/8080, Fortran, Algol-68, PL/1, Pascal, Modula-2, Ada, VAX Lisp, BLISS, MACRO-32, C, and Scheme.  I worked for DEC for eight years on the VMS operating system (TCSEC C2/B1), for TGV and then Cisco, was one of the founders of Network Alchemy, and (nominally) a CTO at Nokia after they bought Network Alchemy.<p>I designed the security auditing subsystem in VMS, was one of the designers of IKE and IPsec, and I designed the IKE over GSSAPI over Kerberos authentication mode that Windows NT uses.  Since 2010, I&#x27;ve been studying Italian and Thai and failing to learn Haskell.  I keep returning to Lisp and Chicken Scheme.  I like Swift, it&#x27;s nicely pragmatic.<p>I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of social media&#x27;s value and I think a lot of Y Combinator startups lack any viable value proposition.  I&#x27;m pretty grumpy about the state of the software industry in general and I am incensed about Silicon Valley&#x27;s cooperation with the NSA since 2001.<p>I believe passionately in privacy and fear my government because my mom grew up in Bavaria during WWII.  She was a translator at Nrnberg after the war and she taught me many things about how good societies can go horribly wrong.",1182186101,1452270433

I was up late last night trying to get somebody to tell me what a PAGE RANK was and its function and why and where was it suspose to be on my Tool Bars and I worked and after almost crashing my computer I found it on the wrong Tool Bar by somebody else, which I never found out until a man e-mailed me from Finland to help and I was real close and he helped me finish the correction. I was worried because I didn't and could not find any site about its function and was told by Google to go to (over their head) to Technology Overview and no help there. I found Aardvark site and through them I got help from that nice guy from Finland. Long story short, I do worry in protecting my Computer. I am glad I found you.

didyoufindit,0,1,0.0,1,0,"My name is Chris, Founder of DidYouFindADeal. My team and I are confident and ready to show you the product that is going to capture the local online advertising industry.<p>PAIN: Brick-and-mortar businesses lack a solution that increase loyal customers. Groupon drives new traffic, but this new traffic is un-targeted and does not return as repeat customers; Foursquare cannot verify check-ins and are thus not used by business owners for loyalty programs. The current Daily Deal model has no long term sustainability for local merchants and is extremely costly.<p>SOLUTION: DidYouFindADeal is a web and mobile application that uses the simplicity of a very proven model (MoneyMailer / ValPak) with the marketing techniques of the Daily Deal Sites. Users Never have to Pre Pay for a Coupon or Deal and Business Owners DO NOT revenue share with us.<p>FUNDING & LOCATION: We have raised $300,000 in seed funding and are located in Irvine, CA.<p>TEAM: Our team and advisory board members have Internet Marketing, Local Advertising, IT, International Business and Legal experience as noted in their bios.<p>TRACTION:<p>During Beta attracted over 800 merchants to a Free Trial in a 45 day period with 2 sales people.\nPost revenue with 20+ customers closed \n70+ businesses in the pipeline including Tustin Buick, Togos, and Arthur Murray Dance Studios. Affiliate programs with Starbucks, Wine.com, Omaha Steaks and more. \nCompletion of mobile app for iPhone and Android",1332815024,1452901076

dipesh_batheja,,2,0.0,17,2,"Hi, I am Dipesh Batheja, web technologies specialist based in New Delhi, India. Obsessed with building beautiful web based software, you can find me in meditative state with my Macbook, building one thing or the other. Nirvana!<p>I started as an independent web developer offering programming services based on .Net framework. Well, I have to admit that in those early days I considered ASP.net to be the best web app framework and C# to be the greatest programming language. In my opinion they were one of the best technologies to write cleaner and more beautiful code but it was not until early 2006, when I discovered even more amazing stuff.<p>ASP.net and C# were nice, but there was still dissatisfaction, so I started to search for some open source frameworks as &quot;alternative&quot;. When I saw what RubyOnRails could do, the clouds parted and the angels started singing. Since then, I have been riding on Rails with my cowboy hats on and firing even more cleaner, shorter and beautiful code from my new super weapon, Ruby. Enlightenment!<p>With time my consulting business grew and client requested more services. So in order to meet the requirements of my clients reliably, I began to build the team in early 2008 to offer wide range of web development services and http://www.NetlingsHQ.com into the existence. Since then many entrepreneurs, web design firms, teams and freelancers have discovered Netlings&#x27; website production services as the most efficient way to convert their beautiful web designs into functional websites.<p>In spare time, I can be found watching movies, listening music, traveling, sleeping, playing badminton or thinking/dreaming about building the next big thing on the Internet. Thats the long and the short of it. Thanks for stopping by!",1340012527,1450207814

But you didn't say you were looking for a co-founder who could hack, you said you were looking for a hacker willing to work for equity.  These are not the same thing.  The distinction is important.  Asking for ""a hacker who works for equity"" (with only a ""chance to be part of the founding team"") makes it sound like you're looking for someone to be an employee and an investor, but not a member of the senior management team.",1205132249

Are you freaking kidding me?<p>This attitude clearly displays no respect for technical abilities involved building a web company from zero. They are looking for a brilliant code monkey who would sit quiet in the corner and code away why they are making the world shattering ""business decisions"".<p>In my view they should get to know another acronym: KMA.",1205131831

132994,comment,132741,132945,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"That's what I would call first-order wealth (i.e. basic goods or services).  It's the equivalent of the fish you give (or perhaps sell) that allows someone to eat for a day.  Getting rich that way is a matter of knowing how much to charge and how much to spend so that you accumulate a surplus.<p>The problem with this kind of ""wealth"" is that it doesn't have much of a network effect.<p>I admire second-order wealth creators more.  This kind of wealth is the knowledge you give (or sell) when you teach someone to fish.  This creates the possibility of more first-order wealth without significantly diminishing the seller's wealth (unless the value of the knowledge itself is directly related to its scarcity).<p>The guy in the original article is clearly a first-order rich guy.  While I applaud him for helping worthy causes, I'd admire him more if he were a creator of second-order wealth, perhaps by starting a YC-like company which would help start new companies in that industry.",1205130740

There's not a hint of ""me too"", ""microsoft replacement"" here. The promise of open source in full force.<p>This is the kind of thing that even 10 years ago would have been barricaded behind <i>dozens</i> of patents and royalties to the point of being unusable; just another technical oddity that no one could afford to use. A few would have been donated to token disabled folks for publicity and then that would have been the end of it.<p>Here's the link to get it and try it out, sans RTFA.<p><a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/</a>",1205130728

One simply needs to believe that charity is a virtue.  Virtue on such a large scale as this is admirable.<p>Regardless of what one things of capitalism, wealth-creation, etc. one can still admire Mr. Feeney for his philanthropic activities.",1205130525
132990,comment,132495,132495,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"It's sad that Microsoft felt the need to sell another OS.  They CAN put out decent software, when they put in the requisite development time and energy.  The windows machines I work on are Windows XP SP 1, which I think was kind of the last decent MS OS.  And you know what?  At the risk of drawing some ire, it's pretty good.  For 99% of what I need to do, it Just Works.  And with good anti-spyware, anti-virus tools, I don't have any problems with malware.<p>Really, I think that most of the problems with Vista can be traced to Microsoft thinking that they needed to make grand, sweeping changes, when they had a perfectly serviceable operating system already.  It's like reinventing the wheel and starting by saying ""okay, we've done the 'circular' thing, what other shapes could we use?""",1205130267

132977,comment,132371,132654,0,0,dewitters,,,"My point in the article is also that we can and need to do better (maybe not clearly explained ;), but it is my belief that using the ""engineering"" metaphor will hold us back. A lot of people, maybe even most, believe that we should improve ourselves by becoming ""more like engineers"". For example by using Formal Methods etc. This might be true for a small number of projects, but it is my believe that for most software projects, as software developers we need to become ""less like engineers"".<p>""Engineering is the application of technical knowledge to solve problems."", therefore, engineers try to gain as much technical knowledge as possible to solve their problems. In my opinion software development should evolve to require less and less technical knowledge, that way we can spend more effort on the real problem: mapping the problem domain into a clear software representation. Developing software should evolve closer towards the human side, and not towards the technical side. And so far, programming languages for example have evolved in that direction.",1205129319

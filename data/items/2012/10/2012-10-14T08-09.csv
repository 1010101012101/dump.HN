4651008,comment,4649524,4650360,8,0,nkoren,,,"I agree with all of your points above, and I very much agree with your final point that doing >= learning.<p>However, I'm going to argue that writing is nonetheless a special case.<p>I was trained as an architect. Unlike photographers, painters, composers, and coders, pre-architects cannot refine their understanding of architecture by doing it. They are confined to various simulations of architecture: models, drawings, renderings, animations, etc. While the emphasis of my course was heavily skewed towards the visual, I personally found that writing was by far the most valuable of all forms of simulation.<p>The reason is that writing has a unique ability to conjure worlds beyond itself. When I do a 2-point perspective drawing, your brain will conjure it into something greater: a three dimensional space. So far, so good. But can you tell me what the air feels like in that space? Is it perfectly still, or moving through a breezeway? Is it dry or humid? Cool or hot against your skin? Does it carry the sound of echoed footsteps, or birdsong, or traffic, or is it completely silent? Does it smell like rain, or concrete, or freshly-cut grass? Do you feel the radiant heat of stones that have been baking in the sun? Or the humid air which has been evaporatively cooled by a fountain or rich foliage? Can you imagine all these things in sequence, as you move through the space? Can you imagine what the space will feel like at night, or in the rain, or when it is completely empty or thronging full of people?<p>A single drawing can never convey all of this, and there are many things that drawings can never effectively convey at all. But a few paragraphs can easily conjure all this and more. This isn't the magic of writing, specifically: it's the magic of <i>language</i>: a powerful virtual-reality engine that is very likely hardwired into our neurons.<p>I found that the the pre-architects who <i>wrote</i> about their work -- and took the writing seriously -- were able to engage with their designs in a far richer capacity than the students who focused on the visual representations alone. This convinced me of the unique importance of writing. It is absolutely true that <i>whatever</i> you want to understand, doing it is better than just learning about it. But doing it <i>and</i> writing about it is best of all.<p>TL;DR: Doing + writing > Doing",1350203418

Unless the poor want it to be, it really can't be.</i><p>That's true in a fully transparent society. But far less so when some players can rig things in their favor by bribes or benefits-in-kind. The article is not criticizing entrepreneurs, but <i>rentiers</i>, people who extract economic profits rather than normal profits. Normal profits are what you have when markets fulfill their function as price discovery mechanisms. Economic profits are what you get when the dominant market players erect barriers to entry of one sort or another in order to fleece consumers.<p>Although I am no Marxist, you are quite wrong to think that Marx's ideas are irrelevant because he would not understand how wealth functions in the modern world. The product of work has changed, but the fundamentals of capital and production have not altered all that much. If you want proof of this, simply read (or at least browse) Adam Smith's <i>wealth of Nations</i>, which was written long before Marx's birth and which remains an excellent, if extremely wordy, introduction to economics. From the factors of production in a variety of different contexts, basic monetary theory, capital structures of the firm and so on, it remains surprisingly relevant (and readable) today. Marx was certainly aware of this, and while his proposed alternative to capitalism was not really workable, his analysis of capitalism's weaknesses still have considerable merit.<p>People can and do abuse the market system for their own gain distressingly often; I like the capitalist system, but the notion that it operates without fault is distinctly Panglossian.",1350202107

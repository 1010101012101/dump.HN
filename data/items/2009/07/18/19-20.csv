712082,comment,711561,711696,0,0,mkyc,,,"You might be agreeing with me, and perhaps are missing my point: more <i>people</i>, especially statisticians, will be engaged in the programming and programming-like tasks that are required to work with ever-increasing data. Not structured-SQL data, but raw and ugly natural-language and legacy-format data. Many programming <i>tasks</i> in the future will be about data, and excel-like ""Illustrative"" programs are very well adapted, even if not Turing-complete (Interesting discussions on the turing completeness/incompleteness of even something like Excel: <a href=""http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProductivityRant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProductivityRant</a> <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.net/item?id=429477"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.net/item?id=429477</a> ). Illustrative programming is just dynamic programming plus immediate feedback of program results - perhaps the ability to click on a GUI element, and change its associated code in realtime, perhaps just the ability to change how a data-point is calculated. The <i>tools</i> will be different.<p>Turing-completeness will always look like Turing-completeness, but this is hardly interesting or relevant. I think that your claim about productivity is entirely false (see something like <a href=""http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/law.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/law.html</a> ), but that's beside the point of my post.",1247946774

None of the experiences I've read really come close to what he went through all those years ago.

Did you go to his high school? Do you know the people he went to high school with? Why is it that you assume that 25 years has made all the jerks in his high school regretful and apologetic ""do-gooders""? If that's the case, where are all of today's criminals coming from? That's a bold statement, I realize and I'm not suggestive that all of today's criminals were high school bullies or that all high school bullies grow up to commit crimes, but they have to come from somewhere right?

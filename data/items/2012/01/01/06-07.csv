3412684,comment,3412643,3412643,0,0,latchkey,,,"I think maybe a better title would be 'Lesson learned: Don't start work until a contract is signed.'<p>I fully understand that the potential for delaying or losing the contract completely could be part of the motivation for starting work in advance or in parallel to a contract. But, it seems that in this case, was the headache worth it?<p>Regardless, I do agree that it sounds like Apress should have treated the author with more respect. I'd love to hear the other side of this story as well.",1325400987

I wanted to say that they don't make 1w laser pointers, but I decided to fact check that first.<p>I was wrong, they do make ""laser pointers"" that powerful.  Browsing their laser safety forum has a post from a teacher wondering what to tell the parents of a rich kid who is playing irresponsibly with a 200mw laser.  Someone suggested helping them find a guide dog....<p>And another person wonders if they should shine their 1w laser back at the neighbors who shine 100-200mw lasers into their house and how may have injured them.   I honestly wonder just how far we are from a media frenzied panic that gets nearly everything banned, safe or otherwise.<p>The voice of reason appears to be some inquisitive teenager, who appears to be more responsible than everyone else.  Forget age restrictions, someday we should figure out a way to test how responsible people are and ban people from doing stuff based on that.",1325400416

3412677,comment,3412643,3412643,0,0,jackowayed,,,"It seems like starting work before a contract is in place (save maybe very high-level exploratory work, like a table of contents) is a recipe for disaster. They don't <i>really</i> owe you anything until there's a signed contract in place saying you do.<p>Now, it's possible that Apress is problematic in that they strongly encourage people to work despite there being no contract in place (""we'll figure it out"", ""you have our word"", ""legal is slow"", etc), which then puts them in a better negotiating position when it is contract time because people have already done much of the work.<p>But I wonder what would have happened if he had said, ""I'll do high-level planning, but I won't write a single paragraph of actual content until we have a firm, mutually-satisfying contract in place."" Maybe it would have gotten him a firm date on when he would get his advance that they would stick to, plus deadlines in the contract that were actually in the future and other good things. Or maybe they would have still said, ""no, just write it, we'll figure that out later"", which would not look good",1325400307

3412673,comment,3410773,3412084,0,0,_delirium,,,"I find more the opposite; RL chat is used for fluffy taking-a-break type stuff (take off a few minutes to go the coffee machine and talk about your weekend), while real work starts once everyone gets back to their desk and puts on headphones, using IRC or IM as a unobtrusive backchannel to discuss the stuff we're working on. Works nicely with collaborative document writing in Google Docs as well.<p>I've tried an ""everyone in the same room"" approach to collaborative document writing a few times, and that was a disaster for >2 people; online just works much better.

3412668,comment,3412289,3412289,0,0,mindcrime,,,"This struck a chord with me:<p><i>Failure, failing, and being “a failure” is such a part of tech culture that it is a cultural locus for entire posts, blogs, pep talks and conventions.</i><p><i>Failure is universally feared and derided, yet framed and re-framed again and again as a means of staying positive, of learning from mistakes, of using failure as a measure of working hard for success.</i><p><i>The ideal of success in tech is married to the terror of failure.</i><p>In that I can definitely relate to the ""fear of failure"" thing.  Especially being one of the older guys doing this stuff, and walking around with a constant feeling of ""I haven't done anything yet, and I'm pretty much down to my last shot.""  But by the same token, I'm always reminded of something I heard a long time ago:<p>""In business, you only have to be right once.""<p>I find that thought to be a powerful antidote to some of the darker thoughts that creep in from time to time.  I keep reminding myself that if this idea doesn't pan out, that it's entirely possible that the next one will be ""the one"" so to speak.<p><i>What undoubtedly makes it worse is the public nature of tech culture, populated with gossip bloggers happy to run any item for page views, the better if it humiliates their competitors. Add to this that the very nature of tech work itself is inherently isolating.</i><p>This may be one advantage to being on the East Coast and removed from the typical SV gossip machine and echo chamber.  Nobody really talks about what we're doing, and the only time my blog posts make it to HN (or similar) is usually when I post them.  And even that's usually just because I'm curious to see if anybody has anything to say.   So we get to sorta ""fly under the radar"" at least so far.   Thinking about it, that might actually be one good reason to adopt a least a ""semi stealth"" approach to your startup...  perhaps it's a way to not go soliciting pressure and expectations until you're really ready for them.",1325399574
3412666,comment,3412643,3412643,0,0,jeremymcanally,,,"I'm convinced that most publishers are difficult to work with and actually care very little for their authors.  It seems that O'Reilly really has some great people inside, and I really think the Pragmatic Bookshelf is a fantastic staff and author program.  But for my part with the few publishers I've worked with, it's been nothing but hassle.<p>The issues with payment were annoying, but even worse in my case were publisher content control struggles.  The book concept I was to work on was explained to me numerous times as ""not a recipe book but an example driven narrative book.""  I think we discussed that at least 5 times leading up to the kick off.  After I submitted the first 3 chapters, they suddenly shifted gears and gave me example outlines for the chapters that remained to follow.<p>They were freaking recipe chapters (problem/solution/discussion ad nauseum).<p>There was no discussion of this change, and any attempted further shift in content was met with ""well we told you we hadn't worked out this series fully yet.""  They'd basically jacked the book out from under me and changed it to a book I didn't want to write.  I think I wrote one or two more chapters and farmed the rest out to contributors.  Terrible experience.<p>To make matters worse, I made very little money off of it because they didn't promote it at all.  They never sent copies to conferences or user groups unless I asked them to.  They never sought out blogs and other things like that to help promote it whatsoever.  Part of the problem was they really sucked at promoting their books (other authors have had the same issues), but another part was that they had about 4 different marketing managers during the timeline for my book, which made coordinating efforts incredibly difficult.<p>So, yes, I think this gent's experience isn't totally out of the norm, even though I wish that wasn't the case.",1325399325

3412657,comment,3411602,3412536,0,0,Natsu,,,"That's a very good point.  It was a long time ago, so they used the old system back then and labeled it as a class IIa:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_safety"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_safety</a><p>I don't remember a wattage offhand and I no longer have that laser pointer, but I think it was under 1 mw.  But there are other safety factors that can come into play, too.  Mostly, it's a matter of how much energy is focused onto how small of an area for how long, not to mention how much of that energy is visible, which is why it's good to know the safety classifications.<p>There are dangerous lasers, after all and it's a bad idea to be cavalier about eye safety around <i>those</i>.  In fact, I saw some just the other day in operation at MakerBench, where they were cutting plastic.  The paper covering the plastic was getting set on fire...  not something you want shining into your eyes.<p>EDIT:  Reading your article scares me a little.  I had a laser from a reputable supplier with an accurate classification.  If they're selling crap with no filters like that nowadays, that's a lot more worrisome.  People might own a laser that's a lot more dangerous than it's marked as being.  Some lasers, especially cheap, ""dim"" green ones may not be what they're marked as.  If it's cheap and not red, it's probably frequency doubled IR, so, yeah, beware....",1325398474

This translates into a fairly good bit of light.<p>As a thought exercise, consider a ridiculously bright 3 watt LED flashlight. Shine it through a 35mm slide to make a miniature projector. You now have enough photons to make something like a 3 foot image. You are going to need about 3 watts of laser to do the same job (no free lunch, except for green of course). A 1 watt laser is more than 10 times the power needed to instantly burn a permanent hole in your retina.",1325398348

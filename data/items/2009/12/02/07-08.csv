As a content-creator, 'distributors' are a middle-man between you and the retailers, but the retailers are middle-men between the distributors and the end-user/customer.<p>The internet is really for reducing costs, but doing something like selling streaming HD video (or just HD video downloads) is not something you can economically accomplish on your own with just a hosting service. You need a framework (iTunes, YouTube, etc) and they become the new distributor. They may be a <i>better</i> distributor (or just more 'barebones'), but they are still a distributor.",1259740386

You might think this unlikely for a large corporation, but it happens. In this case, shuffling around the numbers for the 80% would be extra time and money.<p>edit: Maybe I should mention that I'm not defending them, just pointing out that there <i>could</i> be a plausible explanation. In this case, the plausible explanation is that their accounting people are idiots (they probably think that their system is more reliable because an accountant is looking at all of the numbers instead of some automated process, not taking into account that MS Excel isn't exactly bullet-proof software).",1259739598

It gets paid back out of the band’s share of every album sold, which is roughly 10% of the retail price. So, using round numbers to make the math as easy as possible to understand, let’s say Warner Bros. spent something like $450,000 total on TMJ. If Warner sold 15,000 copies of each of the three TMJ records they released at a wholesale price of $10 each, they would have earned back the $450,000. But if those records were retailing for $15, TMJ would have only paid back $67,500, and our statement would show an unrecouped balance of $382,500.</i><p>Just because the artist is unrecouped doesn't mean the record company isn't making money.",1259739585

I&#x27;ll agree with you as well on Godel and his importance. His theorem is easily one of the most important things to come out of the 20th century. I&#x27;d go: penicillin, atomic bomb, better farming tech and chemistry, Godel.<p>I&#x27;ve not got the chops for the actual proof, but the many &#x27;for the layman&#x27;s&#x27; books Ive read on it just point out how incredibly important it is. From AI research to Turing&#x27;s tape to the nature of reality itself, the proof is just astounding. To put him up on Aristotle&#x27;s level is obvious even to a math layman like me. Likely because of the difficulty of the proof, it is not very well known, and that is a shame. I&#x27;d love a torn-down proof easy enough for a high schooler to understand.

You wouldn&#x27;t blame the program : it&#x27;s just executing on a pronunciation algorithm. The context is just the manipulation of bits and bytes on a stream. It&#x27;s harmless. You wouldn&#x27;t exactly flog the kid, either, he just has a poor sense of humor, and you&#x27;d just roll your eyes at that.<p>The problem we have with the word &quot;faggot&quot; is that, in the majority of cases, it&#x27;s being used in a pretty offensive context, and said context says a lot of things about the person using the word.<p>But when the RapGenius cofounder says offensive stuff (I heard one of them insulted Mark Zuckerberg at a conference?), often the context is just lighthearted jabs.<p>They may be unprofessional and insensitive jabs, but given that they&#x27;re A) just meaning harmless fun and B) building one of the most comprehensive and well-designed text annotation sites on the Internet, we give them some cultural license to have their shitty taste in humor.

His argument is basically that he knows what <i>he</i> means when he uses a word, so how can there be confusion? For example:<p><i>&#x27;When I ask, &quot;How do I know I’m not in the matrix?,&quot; I&#x27;m asking, &quot;Why should I believe that I’m not in the matrix?&quot;&#x27;</i><p>Ok, fine, but is that what <i>everybody</i> who uses the word &quot;know&quot; means by it? And shifting to the word &quot;believe&quot;, as the author does here, doesn&#x27;t help; there&#x27;s just as much argument over what &quot;believe&quot; means, or should mean, as over what &quot;know&quot; means, or should mean.<p>In some cases he doesn&#x27;t even explicitly give his preferred meaning, but just assumes that we all know what it is:<p><i>&#x27;Whether someone was &quot;free to act&quot; is something that we consider often in legal settings, and I think it’s right for us to ask this question before we lock someone up.&#x27;</i><p>Which may well be true, but it still leaves open the question of <i>what, exactly, we are asking</i> when we ask if someone was &quot;free to act&quot;. What do we need to take into account in order to decide the legal case one way or the other? And is the legal question the <i>same</i> question as all the other questions that are pointed at when we use the term &quot;free will&quot;? The author seems to assume that we all agree on all these things, but the philosophical literature makes clear that we don&#x27;t.<p>In fact, as this example illustrates, the author mis-states Graham&#x27;s point about confusion over words. He says:<p><i>&#x27;To say that a question can be answered by saying, &quot;Depends on what you mean by X&quot; is far from proving that the question is motivated by a confusion over words.&#x27;</i><p>But Graham didn&#x27;t claim that we could <i>answer</i> all philosophical questions by just defining what we mean by X (and he certainly didn&#x27;t claim that we could answer them just by <i>saying</i> &quot;Depends on what you mean by X&quot;). He only claimed that the questions aren&#x27;t <i>well-defined</i> unless we specify what we mean by X. What looks like one question could end up being three or four (or seven or eight) depending on which definition we choose for X; so unless and until we pin down the question more precisely, we end up talking past each other instead of actually accomplishing anything. I tend to agree with Graham that much of philosophy suffers from exactly this disease.<p>Finally, I would like to see some evidence for this claim of the author&#x27;s:<p><i>&#x27;Graham seems to be saying that if a philosophy professor can’t distinguish a “real” philosophy paper from a fake, placebo paper that is purposely filled with nonsense, then the real paper is meaningless. If this is Graham’s proposal, I think that many philosophy professors could pass this test for many philosophical texts. There are definitely some charlatans posing as philosophers out there, but that doesn’t mean that all or most of philosophy is B.S.</i>",1401136805

Issue a read barrier before reading the data.<p>Avoid cache line thrashing in a mostly full case by never allowing the circular buffer to become completely full (leave at least one cache line free).<p>The reader thread can quickly poll many circular buffers for work.

Part of it was due to the style in which he wrote his manifesto. And certainly part of it was the fact that his grievances confirmed a lot of the (probably accurate) biases people have about the LAPD.<p>All that is a prelude to the argument that the annotations on the Dorner &quot;manifesto&quot; do not in fact show RG at its best. Like the Rodgers incident, the Dorner incident is tremendously sad. It was not an armed struggled between a wronged former officer and the police establishment; it was a manhunt that followed the cold-blooded murder of an innocent woman and her fiance. But you might not get that impression from clicking through the animated GIFs, lyrical references, and amplified exposition of Dorner&#x27;s complaints in the annotations on the site.<p>Again, I think this isn&#x27;t so much a problem with reading and studying the output of the mentally ill, but instead with the idea of doing that on a site that encourages random anonymous people to riff off of and respond to that output.

The price is that C++ is huge, the compilers are slow due to the complexity, and it is really analogous to per project technical debt.<p>D exists because C++ was too slow.

Maybe they also saw how C# and Java were useful and popular, but they put this massive VM under them to simplify the implementation and standardization.<p>Go exists because C++ was too big - for its purpose, of web server development, you wanted native performance with natural asynchrony and multi processing. It still doesn&#x27;t have generics because it is pretty much a domain language, I think.<p>Rust exists because C++, in the wake of C++11, is still a complicated <i>mess</i> of syntax. And in order to maintain backwards compatibility, C++ is terribly unsafe and every line of code can destroy your program. I think Rust is as close to the future of native languages, because it does the C++ thing - a general purpose language, where everything is deterministic and predictable because it is direct binary translation between language constructs and assembler with limited magic - and does that backwards compatibility break to fix the significant flaws.<p>I still don&#x27;t like the Rust syntax much, but it might one day grow on me. I don&#x27;t think its really approachable though, I&#x27;d definitely be interested in trying a &quot;pythonic&quot; static typed language that emphasizes safety and productivity while maintaining the poster C++ ideology of providing reasonable abstractions that don&#x27;t hide the details, but let the expert more intuitively interact with them.",1401135181

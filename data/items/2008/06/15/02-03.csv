I'd watch my karma tick away and be like ""What are these folks doing?  What on earth is wrong with what I said?  How does it lessen the quality of the conversation?""<p>Then I realized, it just doesn't matter.  This isn't a contest, it's a community.  All this measures is the general vibe of the comment.  Higher numbers = better vibe.  A fuzzy value at best.<p>More useful I think would be to see the total score, but also be able to mouse over the score to see how many down-votes and how many up-votes something received.  But that would very likely require a big change by PG to maintain three scores, not one.",1213498778
217863,comment,217591,217854,0,0,LPTS,,,"I'm not emotional.  You are wrong that everyone is emotional to some degree.  Your rules are also wrong in certain cases.  I would say more in email.  Too far off topic here.<p>I'm looking out for the blind spots of all my teammates who are deluded into lionizing a propagandist because they thought he was entertaining on TV or have problems relating to death.  I love my teammates so much that I'm willing to do this even though their pain around death and stupid conventions make them not like it.  Like some sort of 21rst century Bodhisattva, I'm sacrificing my accumulated karma points to help all beings on hacker news.  :)<p>When I worked with people on hospice, my clients seemed to really like me because most people treated them like they were dying or already dead and I naturally treated them like they were still alive.  So my atypical reaction to the taboo about death isn't all bad.  Dying people really liked that I wasn't emotionally affected by their death (they know their dying, they don't want everyone to be constantly reminding them of that by the way they act, because then their death costs them the rest of their human interaction too).  But the survivors and mourners of dead people?  Not so much into my attitude (except the ones that saw me work with their loved ones, and the nurses).",1213498709

217854,comment,217591,217847,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"LPTS -- I haven't had a lot to say to you on this thread. I think you're sadly off in your own world somewhere, but hey, we all have to live somewhere. I just didn't see the point of trying to chase you down over HN. Logic and language games are always fun -- another reason I like politics so much.<p>Part of this comment, however, deserves a reply. I can see where people think you're not very emotional and you would feel complimented by being called emotional. I would ask you to honestly consider that all people are emotional creatures. The more you've heard in your life how logical you are, the more you've probably bought into it. It's a lie.<p>Rule #1: People believe what they want to believe and use their mind and reasoning capability to justify it.<p>Rule #2: This is always easy to see in other people but tough as heck to see in yourself.<p>I post this because HN is full of bright, ambitious people. We're just the type of people to be logical, analytical, cold, etc. The sooner we all realize that introspection is more valuable than argument, the sooner we can work more effectively as a team. You see, good teams are full of these broken mammals called humans, each looking out after the other guy's blind spots. It's not a Vulcan debating society.<p>That's it for the sermon.",1213497551

The wide-spread reaction to his death show better the role he played in an industry that is far from perfect.<p>As for ""this time"", the evidence has already been made obvious. The administration gamed the case for war. No journalist was going to prove them wrong then. Russert asked the questions that needed to be asked. If only half of his peers did the same, we <i>may</i> have been in a different world today.<p>Good night.",1213497498
217852,comment,217772,217845,0,0,shimon,,,"ISPs charge consumers a monthly fee for theoretically unlimited usage because that's the way most people are comfortable paying for their internet usage.  Even a geek like me doesn't have a clear idea of how much bandwidth I use in a month, so for most people a per-byte-transferred pricing scheme would be totally unclear.  Contrast this with something like per-minute phone usage pricing.<p>Bandwidth certainly is cheap, and constantly getting cheaper, but the average consumer's bandwidth usage is also increasing.  A few years ago, as filesharing became mainstream, broadband ISPs found it much more costly to provide unlimited service.  Their ways of managing this extra cost include some throttling but also, interestingly, a proliferation of local peering.<p>Local peering is when two small ISPs, say in a single city, notice they are both paying their ISPs in order to send traffic to each other, and decide to instead run a line between themselves and exchange traffic on that line instead of paying their ISPs.  There was never any reason to do this sort of peering on a local level until we all started sharing music and movies with other folks in our neighborhoods; the increased demand has led ISPs to make a lot of the bandwidth we use less costly for them.",1213497394

217847,comment,217591,217841,0,0,LPTS,,,"My evidence of collusion includes the quotes by Tim and Cheney's press person at the Scooter Libby trial, and these quotes.  These are not little linguistic tics, but well documented propaganda techniques.<p>What you find dirty and distasteful is the fact that you are going to inevitably die, and could drop dead any second like Tim did, not my comments.  Confronted by the sudden death of someone you liked, and attacks on him, you attack back, as if by refuting the attacks on him you can fight back against the inevitability of death.<p>Because I don't care about the fact I'm dying, I do not let death cloud my judgement of the recently dead.  This gives me a freedom to objectively judge them and the impact they have had on the world.  Not respecting the taboo on death makes groups that are obsessively afraid of death not like me very much.<p>This is the first time in my life I've been called too emotional and not rational enough.  I'll take it as a compliment, I guess.  Most people tell me I don't seem like I have emotions.  I get vulcan a lot.  Never too emotional.  So, thanks!<p>It's easier to think some guy you talked to online is an ass (which I am.  don't care)  then admit you've been fooled by a propagandist for 5 years, especially right after a shocking death.  I don't expect to change your mind.  I'm sorry for your sense of loss, and hope you'll eventually reconsider in light of what will be revealed about this time over the next few years.",1213496659

217844,comment,217591,217711,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"Clinton's concession was not simply damaging because it wasn't   hacker news--stories of that nature threaten hacker news as a whole.<p>(1) A story about Clinton's concession contains no information content.  Everyone at all tracking politics knew it was coming, and anyone who cared about when it happened could have predicted the timing reasonably well in advance.  Tim Russert dying is a story with no hacker news content, but it is at least some information--I sincerely doubt anyone was predicting Russert's imminent demise.<p>(2)  A story about Clinton conceding is divisive to the community.  It brings up a topic of discussion unrelated to the topic that brings this community together, and, given the tendency of some people to downvote in order to indicate disagreement, ultimately increases the homogeneity of the viewpoints expressed here.  Most people do not find Russert's death nearly as divisive.  Regardless of what you think of the quality of Russert's interviews, historical trends tend to indicate that he will be replaced by someone worse at it.<p>(3)  A story about Clinton's concession reminds everyone of how Reddit came to be what it is.  This sort of story is relatively benign in this respect.<p>(4)  The story about Clinton conceding--if it had been popular--brings the baggage of continual political stories in its wake.  If every time a major media figure dies there is a single HN story about it, HN is not incredibly damaged by this.",1213496430

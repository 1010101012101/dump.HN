My two observations:<p>1) Linux, even the most modern distro like Ubuntu, is a huge time sync for anyone that&#x27;s not just content to browse the web and check mail in a system setup for them.<p>2) More users that we think are in that category (besides the proverbial &quot;grandparents&quot; perhaps).<p>You got a video from your wedding you need to edit?

Reminiscing about the psychic torture that he believes White’s original monkey patient suffered, he added, “I remember that the head would wake up, the facial expressions looked like terrible pain and confusion and anxiety.” He dismissed Canavero’s theory as “bad science.” Given how controversial the monkey experiment itself was, it’s highly likely that Silver is one of many.<p>I like jessriedel&#x27;s comment in the HN discussion from 647 days ago at <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5972171"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5972171</a> :<p>> There are plenty of crazy doctors out there who make nutzo claims not backed up by evidence in their field.

9353885,comment,9352611,9352611,0,0,azoapes,,,"The day before yesterday, I held an interview much like this one. I presented a candidate with a problem of easy-to-intermediate difficulty (Fibonacci) and asked him to explain his thought process while coding. I did interrupt his thought process two times to ask what he was thinking, both times when it felt obvious that he was stuck (extended staring followed by a couple of heavy sighs). But my principle was to only provide him with advise when he asked for it. I told him beforehand that his performance was not evaluated or affected by getting stuck or asking for guidance, but that we would not leave the room until we had come up with at least one solution together. I stayed in the room but was drinking coffee and reading e-mails. I told him that the excercise is expected to take up to an hour, and that he didn&#x27;t need to hurry. When I tested this problem on two of my colleagues it never took more than 15-20 minutes.<p>This excercise in particular took a little more than an hour, because even though I explained a few solutions in various ways he had a hard time actually completing any code. I wrote a whiteboard solution and explained it using arrows and walk-through examples, but he couldn&#x27;t translate the solution into actual code (using a language of his choice). In order not to break the hour limit we ended up with me writing and explaining code one line at a time for him. I reassured him that it&#x27;s okay that he can&#x27;t come up with the code right now, we&#x27;re not evaluating the result etc.<p>I turned this candidate down. I feel that while my methodology (close to OP&#x27;s) has flaws, it does help me with filtering out the worst candidates. I simply can&#x27;t hire someone that doesn&#x27;t manage to, with an unlimited amount of help and a generous timeframe, code a Fibonacci sequence in his/her favourite language.",1428669876

I can&#x27;t be the only one that has been woken up at 2am because of an XYZ outage.</i><p>XYZ could be NFS, SCSI, MySQL, Rails, KVM, ..., you get the idea.  Any technology that has seen wide use has caused someone to be woken up at 2am because of an outage.  NFS has been very widely used for a very long time.  As a distributed file system developer who once helped design a precursor of pNFS I think NFS has some pretty fundamental problems, but the fact that NFS servers sometimes go down is not one of them.  Often that&#x27;s more to do with the implementation and/or deployment than the protocol, and no functionally similar protocol would do much better under similar circumstances.  People get woken up at 2am because of SMB failures too.  My brother used to get woken up at 2am because of RFS failures.  Nobody gets woken up at 2am because of 9p failures, but if 9p ever grew up enough to be deployed in environments with people on call I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d lose sleep too.  EBS failures have bitten more than a few people.<p>Citing the existence of failures, other than <i>proportionally to usage</i>, isn&#x27;t very convincing.

If it&#x27;s a web browser then sure, hostnames have become the way of doing that (although even then, browsers are starting to display the organization name in the top left alongside the URL).

Even for something as basic as email, you&#x27;d rather encrypt to a specific person than encrypt to gmail.com.<p>So in short hostname-based authentication is mostly useful for web browsers - which is why it&#x27;s in the web browser, not the OS.<p>(Also, pragmatically, existing OS-based key management is terrible - just try and use the Windows dialogues to set up an SSL client certificate.

Again, RAID doesn&#x27;t protect you from that, but a proper backup system does.<p>And finally, it&#x27;s not unheard-of for RAID systems of any kind to just fall over. Even a RAID 10 is a whole lot of redundancy all running on a single drive controller; if that drive controller does something very silly -- and I&#x27;ve seen it happen, we&#x27;ve personally shipped systems to data recovery outfits for this -- then you can end up with garbage on all of your drives.<p>There are two different concepts at work here. &quot;Redundancy&quot; and &quot;High Availability&quot;.

Both hardware and software are instrumental to the success of any of their devices.<p>How could you say the creator of the modern-day smartphone is not a hardware company? iPod? iMac? MacBook Air? iPad? Their hardware may even be their biggest differentiator. Samsung&#x27;s new Galaxy S6 is a perfect indication that competitors are far behind Apple&#x27;s innovation in terms of hardware design. Same goes for the Google / TAG partnership for creating a new watch. Any time Apple releases a new device, competitors follow, primarily in terms of hardware.<p>Apple is not a spec company, sure, but many of their key innovations show up in their hardware&#x27;s form factor, aesthetics, and finish.",1428667403

I&#x27;ve gone from 802.11g to n to ac and I&#x27;ve yet to see any noticeable gains bringing me even <i>close</i> to plain old Gigabit ethernet.<p>It cannot compete nor compare when it comes down to even individual aspects: reliability, individual throughput, total throughput (due to shared medium access), nor setup speeds.<p>I&#x27;m not just talking &quot;a little bit slower&quot;. I&#x27;m talking 1 minute guaranteed to succeed (ethernet), vs 1 hour guaranteed to fail (wifi). In real world performance, it&#x27;s orders of magnitudes slower. That&#x27;s measurable. That&#x27;s a fact.<p>For lots of use-cases wifi is <i>utterly useless</i>. Have fun trying to backup media to a iSCSI volume over wifi for instance.<p>I&#x27;m guessing you don&#x27;t live in a heavily populated area where the wifi-bands are over-consumed and have little more effective BW than 25mbps to offer. The same crap I was promised would improve half a decade ago. It haven&#x27;t.<p>A huge part of the tech-hungry power-users lives in these places and suffers through this subpar performance.

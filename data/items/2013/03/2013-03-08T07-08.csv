Now in a bit more than 2 months you'll have broken even on the reserved price compared to the old DynamoDB price, and in a bit more than 3 months compared to the new DynamoDB price, for the 1 year investment. Any company using Dynamo for anything serious will probably rush to get the reserved capacity, since they've probably been spending a multiple of the reserved cost per month anyway.",1362729587

5342450,comment,5342147,5342238,16,0,smalley,,,"There are actually substantially more steps involved in reverse engineering more modern SOCs. After depackaging the chips you have to strip the metal layers, special protective layers etc to get to the base layers. Modern processes can have upwards of 8 metal layers along with a top layer composed of filled metal (there are issues with processing if a relatively uniform amount of metal isn't on each layer).<p>After you get the images of the metal layers (you likely can't do this optically for things down near Metal1) you can image the poly and diffusions. You can probably guess which transistors are which based on which power rails they would have been connected to.<p>Things might be easier if you know what standard cell library the designers used when laying out the chip, as then you'd more easily be able to identify the base logical functions faster.<p>If you're being thorough you'd also have to make sure you obtain measurements of the widths of each of the transistors (so you can later figure out the relative drive strength which matters for things like identifying keeper circuits or more precision analog elements etc).<p>Determining some transistor behavior make require even more complicated tests to identify doping levels and if you were trying to duplicate the process you'd have to identify a large number of other materials (for example if they use copper you'd want to find what chemical they used to control the diffusion etc).<p>It's pretty interesting stuff though.",1362729519

I'm too young to actually remember this, but I know from various sources that women under communist regimes, at least in central Europe, were seen as capable of working as hard as men. There are many posters of women driving agricultural machines (I don't know the word in English - something that's used to harvest cereal) and doing various other works that are traditionally associated with men. Aside from posters there were poems, novels and plays written that depicted women in the similar fashion, and later even tv shows, some of which are still popular today, showed women as soldiers, spies or even ""entrepreneurs"" of a kind. They supposedly had no problem with getting into colleges too. I don't know how much of this is true, but I guess the communists really did <i>something</i> for gender equality; I won't tell you what exactly and how much of an impact it had though.",1362729233

DMCA is filed by a person/entity with the service-provider.<p>2. Service-provider takes down offending content.<p>3. The person/entity that submitted the offending content now has the option to file a counter-notice with their service provider claiming that they feel/know there is no infringement.

It feels more like a feature box being checked than a core element of the game. I get the impression that they tried, but it ultimately feels incongruent with the core mechanics.<p>There's another element, which is a bit hazier, but being that this game is a sequel, there are certain expectations that people come into it with for a Sim City game -- expectations which aren't met. Sim City is a game about playing mayor, and all the social nonsense is sort of getting in the way of that experience. Especially since the whole ""online"" aspect has kept me from playing it today AT ALL, because the ""server is full"" -- despite the fact that I played 10 hours yesterday and felt no need to interact with anyone. I'd happily leave behind the whole social nonsense and just play the damn game if it would let me.<p>This isn't a proper Sim City game. It's like going to a restaurant and ordering spaghetti, and getting something entirely different. Sure I want the restaurant's take on spaghetti, but you can't stray too far without inventing a new dish. I wanted spaghetti, and instead I got mac and cheese.

Rand's philosophy is hierarchical: metaphysics, then epistemology, then morality, then politics. Derivative issues in politics are largely ""implementation defined."" For example, I don't think you can have a government without any taxes at all in today's world, whereas Rand thought no taxes would be the ideal thing to aim for. That issue doesn't have any bearing on whether Objectivism is correct or not.<p>Surely one derives from the other, and contradictory conclusions at one level should indicate flaws at a higher level. ""Check your premises.""<p>> So, it's an error of context to say that the non-aggression is some universal moral rule that implies that we all have to have anarcho-capitalism. It's not a moral rule, it's a political rule. It's part of the next level up.<p>Then surely this defines Objectivist politics down towards nothing at all, since it can be violated at the point where it's necessary for a government to maintain monopoly over the use of force, and it can be violated before there's a government, and so forth.<p>If you want to abandon Objectivist politics entirely you may, but the main selling point of Rand is her ability to derive ""privately owned roads"" from ""the validity of the senses"" (qua ""concepts in a hat"": <a href=""http://mol.redbarn.org/objectivism/ConceptsInAHat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mol.redbarn.org/objectivism/ConceptsInAHat/</a>)<p>> I don't claim that I can provide evidence for the things I say about Kant, because that evidence presupposes agreement on fundamentals of Objectivism, and that's not something I can provide evidence for either, other than pointing to reality and suggesting someone undertake a multi-year study of the Objectivist literature. So, the stuff about Kant is just intended as a ""sampler,"" something to get someone thinking and maybe intrigued.<p>The stuff about Kant is, to give largely the same handwavy explanation, utterly wrong as well. Rand may have built up Kant as a kind of straw man, but this isn't an honest or realistic reading of Kant. Rand's misreading of Kant is an honest mistake and a historical accident, not a useful introduction to Objectivism.<p>> normal people do not have the epistemological background to _not_ make errors that have to do with disassociating abstractions (concepts, principles) from the concretes they refer to. Ayn Rand calls that ""rationalism,"" and I think that's the category in which your mistake falls<p>I think it's Rand who makes this error by making measurement omission so central to her epistemology.<p>> the only thing that kept drawing me back to Objectivism was honestly realizing that nothing else made sense<p>It's interesting that you have this psychological need for everything to make sense to you within a comprehensive system. This is the biggest and most problematic appeal of ideologues and systematists in philosophy, whether Rand or Hegel.",1362727286

Storing encrypted data (even if you don't have the ability to decrypt it) falls under some rules in PCI compliance.<p>This is all hand-wavy of course. I had to comb through so many pages of PCI compliance documentation, rules, definitions, etc when working as a sys admin to create actionable plans on getting PCI compliant before we'd actually be audited. I remember this because I found it absolutely inane that it required storage of encrypted materials be stored as if they were sensitive but was fine with transmitting credit card #s over untrusted networks and the internet as long as they were ""strongly"" encrypted (this wasn't qualified, either).<p>Im really thankful we have people trying to simplify this headache for people, but why are we content letting this be our problem? It can easily cost hundreds of thousands of $$ PER SITE to become PCI compliant (which has, from what I've seen, been insufficient to protect the information anyway).  Is there any proposed legislation that would force these companies (VISA, MC, Discover, etc) to adopt a fundamentally secure transaction system? Right now they're content with shoving all costs to third parties and ignoring theft because everyone has to be insured.. why isn't there severe outcry over this? It's wasteful on the magnitude of billions a year, I'm sure, and despite its brokenness, they STILL charge for every transaction. Sure, engineering around the problem creates a niche for companies like Braintree and other payment gateways to fill, but that's really just shifting a cost that shouldn't exist from one place to another. Why?<p>It's all so terrible. I'd rather just use bitcoins or something.",1362727186

It's not quite a bad actually, did see all the code as on small phone.

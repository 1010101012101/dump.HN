    (void*)&pointer == (void*)&pointer[0] // likely false (although it could be true by coincidence)
</code></pre>
A <i>pointer to</i> an array is the address of the first element.<p>The name of an array can be <i>trivially and implicitly converted to</i> the address to it&#x27;s first element, but this conversion <i>creates</i> a (temporary) pointer, it does not make the array itself a pointer!<p>The array (nor it name) is not in and of itself storage for any such address, it is no pointer, and as a result &array won&#x27;t give you back a pointer-to-pointer because there&#x27;s no underlying 4-8 byte storage for the underlying pointer - there&#x27;s no permanent pointer to point to.",1426957184

Today, &quot;self-driving&quot; cars are legally just assistive technology like cruise control and you&#x27;re responsible. If you have an accident while texting you&#x27;re in pretty much the same situation as if your car didn&#x27;t have those technologies.<p>Presumably at some point we have cars that can legally operate fully autonomously (under some defined set of conditions) and the driver would not be expected to be in control.

9243242,comment,9242825,9243048,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"Revocation is Hard. The problem is that the way certificates work is supposed to be asynchronous: You get a certificate from the CA, the client has the CA&#x27;s public key, so you give the certificate to the client which can verify it without talking to the CA. This is pretty important if you want to secure something that needs to keep working even if it isn&#x27;t on the internet, or the internet is down, or the CA&#x27;s servers are down (or under DoS), etc.<p>But you can&#x27;t do revocation that way. The client can get the certificate from the server being certified, but it can&#x27;t get a revocation that way because nothing forces the server provide the revocation.<p>To do revocation you have to have a database of all the revoked certificates and check every certificate against the database before accepting it. But there are too many revoked certificates to store on the client; the database is too big. And if the client has to query some server then the attacker can DoS or MITM that server.<p>The best way to handle &quot;revocation&quot; is to fully automate certificate issuance like Let&#x27;s Encrypt, but then only issue certificates for a short period of time, like 10 days (but renewed every 7). Then you don&#x27;t have to worry about revocation because the certificate expires in about the same amount of time it would take to be detected and distributed in a revocation database.",1426956009

The search space of a program is enormous. Instead one possible world is one in which exploits can be found automatically, but discovery requires massive computational effort. This seems extremely likely to me because exploits that don&#x27;t require massive computational effort will be found and limited quickly eliminating the low hanging fruit.o<p>Thus governments with the best algorithms and the most money/powerplants/datacenters/fabs have an advantage because they can patch their own software while developing exploits for other peoples software.<p>The strategy comes in at:<p>1. how many exploits do you keep in reserve given a particular rate of discovery, and how and when do you use exploits?<p>2. How do you handle the case when you and the target are using the same software? If you start to patch it, the exploit might leak to the target.

We&#x27;re nowhere near big enough to exert market pressure on someone the size of MS or the hardware manufacturers. When we recently added UEFI support to our product, we looked at support for UEFI secure boot as well. Some systems made key management easy (obvious bios options, etc.), but others made it impossible. Upon investigation, this mostly appears to be more due to apathy on the hardware vendors part than any conspiracy theory, but for an end user the distinction is unimportant. Today we can work-around this by using an MS-signed bootloader shim, but this reduces the security of the end solution (any ms-signed shim will boot, a third party owns the root keys). And, as I mentioned in my comment above, MS can change their policies at any time.<p>I haven&#x27;t run into an x86 system yet that doesn&#x27;t at least allow you to disable secure boot, but the trend towards more locked-down hardware in general (esp. in mobile) worries me due to the potential for anti-competitive behavior towards both commercial and open-source software from third parties.",1426954905

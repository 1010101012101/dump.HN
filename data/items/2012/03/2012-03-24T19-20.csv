Essentially if stock ABC costed $50 at one exchange, but people were willing to buy ABC at $55 on another exchange, a quick trader could buy the stock at $50 on one exchange, and sell the equivalent on the other exchange for $55, making a ""free"" $5 without any change in their holdings.

They change as needed to introduce new features. The current design is to make room for third party content & services. In this sense the current generation Apple TV is just a place-holder for a future product. Apple has said as much by referring to it as a hobby. What they are doing is laying the groundwork for this future product. AirPlay, iOS Remote, 1080P video, third party services with sign-up and payment, iCloud, etc. The current generation Apple TV is almost just a public beta test of these technologies. When they are ready to do the 'real' Apple TV they will introduce an entirely new UI to go with it.<p>This sort of public R&D isn't what Apple normally does but I think the challenge of building this product requires it. They need to soften the ground a bit. Of course other companies are working on the same things which helps too. People are comfortable with IPTV services. Current residential broadband can keep up fairly well with good 1080P video. The more SmartPhones and tablets sold the closer we are to ditching a dinky multi-button remote control in favor of multi-touch control. The integration with the cloud for re-downloading content and interconnecting different devices solves a ton of usability problems.

All the things that ""make C fast"" are really ways of making the ""underlying machine"" fast <i>through</i> C, and trying to come up with new language constructs that facilitate these techniques seems like a losing game. Any new languages are going to have a hard time catching up to C when it comes to compiler optimizations and can never really catch up when it comes to ubiquity. (Would your 5-year-old compiler target dsPIC and have support for their IO ports and interrupts? clearly not)<p>So, what about a modern safe language that's meant to be used <i>alongside</i> C? For example, the language presents a modern approach to modules and imports, but a function 'bar' in a module 'foo' is compiled down to a straightforward foo___bar() in the generated C. The generated C has straightforward type declarations and readable code, with a minimum of macro abstractions. The source language emphasizes features that allow one to write concise reasonably performant code (H-M, local inference, sum types, some kind of object polymorphism). It has implicit GC, but mostly relies on linear references and stack allocation, falling back to real GC only for explicit unknown-life allocations (with swappable collectors for different runtime overhead). Do-everything capabilities like unsafe pointer arithmetic are completely left out, as the programmer can drop back to C in a neighboring file or inline. The per-project ratio of this new language to C would vary depending on the type of the project - something like a network server would use a minimum of C, perhaps just in cordoned-off performance critical code.<p>(I've been mulling on this idea for a few weeks. I ran across Felix the other day, and found myself nodding a lot, but the language seemed quite complicated and the array details in particular left me wondering if memory safety was even a design goal.)",1332617432

With 100s of programmers the patches come fast and furious. Faster than they can be built. A complete build cycle with all tests can take hours. Sharding (spliting the build and tests across multiple machines) helps but even that has its limits.<p>Some systems therefore start a build once the previous build has finished and take all patches that came in since the last build started which can be anywhere from 1 to 30 patches. They run the tests, if there are any failures the system shuts down and someone manually has to look at the last N patches and try to figure out which patch needs to be rejected.<p>So, what's your experience here? Remember this is specific to LARGE projects. Projects with 100s of programmers. Projects with tens of thousands of tests.<p>- Have you done anything special to speed things up?<p>- Have you tried auto-rejecting all patches when one is bad?<p>- Have you figured out a way to do one patch at a time and still keep up?<p>- Have you subdivided patches after a failure and still been able to keep up?<p>- Have you used any special build software that has special features that help this problem?<p>What are your best tips or practices?",1332616719

I would also never think of using APL as the basis of a commercial project unless there was an overwhelming reason to do so.<p>A friend of mine built a nice company around a product built entirely around Forth.  He loved the language.  And, he lived to regret making that decision.  He eventually paid gobs of money to have the entire code base re-written in C.  A couple of years later he sold the business for several million.  Potential buyers did not want to touch him with the Forth code base.  Just a reality of business.<p>To clarify, the potential buyers were not interested in the Forth code base because they did not use Forth themselves.  Acquiring a company whose products were based around Forth would mean adding a new layer of developers to their team and, effectively, byfurcating their efforts and skill sets.  A code base written in C was a no-brainier for most interested parties.  With C on the table the language was just a check-box item that did not require further discussion.  With Forth the discussions stopped right there.<p>Again, nothing to do with the merits of the language and everything to do with business realities.",1332615948

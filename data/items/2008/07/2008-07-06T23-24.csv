It's an attempt to say something while really saying nothing. Problem is, I know the same can be said of theism. But I think the latter is that much more compelling because it starts and ends with one question - ""God"" - that we can pose to ourselves. Where the answer leads is up to us to decide.",1215388752

If you're a white or Asian nerd, there are plenty of other similar nerds for you to associate with. However, if you're a black or Hispanic nerd, there aren't so many.<p>For me, this never ended up being a problem because all of the nerds shared almost every class, so we ended up being a pretty tight group on our own. For a black nerd who wasn't as nerdy as I am, things were probably more difficult. He wouldn't be in all of the same classes, so he wouldn't grow as close to the nerds, but he'd still be relatively isolated from the ""normal"" black people.<p>It seems that blacks and Hispanics have a larger social disincentive for being a nerd than other groups, though that is probably on the lower end of factors that contribute to underrepresentation in the nerd population.",1215388499

238132,comment,238099,238124,0,0,petercooper,,,"Indeed. In fact, thanks to this I have discovered that what I was taught as ""long division"" is not what other people (or, at least, Wikipedia and those in this video) were taught. The method I use still works though, but appears to be more of a dead reckoning system and heavier on the mental arithmetic.",1215388290

It is certainly labor intensive and tedious, this does not mean that the work is trivial.  In the context of this particular conversation, of all the problems that are being solved between startups and academia I hardly think that someone could label academic research trivial.  If someone chooses to work on lame problems, thats mostly their fault, but there are plenty of interesting/difficult problems to be solved.",1215387853

But this has little to do with how it's defined (or even its metaphysical significance); positive and negative definitions are for all intents and purposes equivalent.",1215386767
238122,comment,237955,237955,0,0,andres,,,"I have noticed the same phenomenon in the black and hispanic community as wumi. I think PG's explanation is still valid though. Kids choose popularity over intelligence because becoming successful by being smart seems to be more difficult than becoming successful by being popular. There have not been many visible examples of blacks and hispanics who became successful by being smart so when a child has to choose between intelligence and popularity they are more likely to choose popularity.<p>I'm going to hypothesize that there is a correlation between unpopularity of nerds and the probability of success through intelligence. The less likely it is that people will become successful by being smart the more likely people will try to be successful by being popular. In the competition to become popular the first ones to lose are the ones who don't care about being popular: nerds.<p>There are a lot more examples of smart and successful blacks and hispanics now than there were a generation ago. I bet that black nerds will become more popular soon. Of course, they'll still be unpopular because they're nerds.",1215386746

By which I mean a son or daughter of American Slavery.<p>I only ask because I would like to hear from one of them, about being a nerd in the black community.  The reason I ask is because I've seen in Newark and LA for example, where even black athletes are only worried about getting home after school.  I talked to a football standout from Newark and his exact words were,""I'm not tryin' to meet new faces at school, if I want women, that's what church is for.""  What I mean is, when I talk to these kids you get the sense that, between the police, the teachers, and the gang members, high school for them is a dangerous place.  Many of them have expressed little interest in popularity, or looking down on others, indeed, they express little interest in even knowing others.  It is dangerous to them.  They SEEM to be just trying to get through the day without crossing the wrong person.  Or as the young man I talked to would say, ""Ain't no kids in a ghetto high school.""<p>This contrasts sharply with things I've read in the national press and in reports like this about being 'cool', and looking down on the smart kids.<p>-- EDITED OUT A PART PEOPLE MAY FIND OFFENSIVE --<p>I'd imagine the average nerdy guy from the black underclass is far more concerned with mistaken identity on his way home, than he is with being accosted because he is smart.<p>But again, I'd like to know if I'm way off here.",1215386477

Usually when you actually read it, you will find it not particularly brilliant and only vaguely applicable. This can be perplexing. ``Is there something wrong with me? Am I missing something?'' The truth, most often, is that reading the book or paper in question has, more or less by chance, made your friend think something useful about your research topic by catalyzing a line of thought that was already forming in their head.""",1215385923

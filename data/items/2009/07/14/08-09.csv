If, for example, I laid down some pretty useful code and open sourced it - then a startup came along, used it to bootleg their code and made millions I'd be pretty upset. That's not what it was open sourced for (because no one benefits from their millions).<p>Perhaps no money required but it is nice for companies in those situations to say ""yeh and we built it on the awesome XXXXX (link to site)"". Because that means <i>more</i> people can find something that is useful to them.",1247561795

Language is everything.<p>Seriously - in most places sufficiently different from the US to be interesting, language will be your first and most formidable barrier, on the other side of which lies one of the most satisfying experiences you've ever had.  It'll take 6 months after you arrive to cross the language barrier.  Your life will rock afterward, so plan at least 3 months (more is better) to enjoy the awesome part.<p>Example: I noticed I'd crossed the barrier when I managed to land a gig drumming for a Tokyo funk band, and I was the only Gaijin in the bar at our first gig).  From then on, life in Japan was awesome.  I could call up and organize scuba diving trips in obscure bays on my own, I could pick up Japanese girls using <i>only</i> Japanese (try that!)<p>Fun.",1247561681

703333,comment,702247,702906,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Then consider that they would come under speech restrictions through no fault of their own.</i><p>Being served a warrant would not necessarily involve fault, either, yet it would put them under speech restrictions -- restrictions against making true and public statements.  So current law already accepts that people can be punished for making true and public statements without committing any other bad acts.<p>I don't think the judge would order them to publish a false statement.  I think the judge would simply punish them for revealing the warrant and respond to their pleas of speech coercion by saying, ""Hey, your fault, not mine, and you did it on purpose.""  I mean, they're intentionally committing themselves to <i>either</i> publishing a false statement <i>or</i> breaking the law.  They've showed their willingness, indeed their intention, to do one or the other if served with a warrant.  If they intended to break the law, then they can hardly argue their innocence.  If they intended to publish a false statement, then they can hardly argue that the court coerced them to do so.  And the fact that they already explained their cunning plan means they can't argue lack of foresight, either.<p>As for novelty, I wouldn't even trust a lawyer to know whether this is novel.  People have been splitting legal hairs since long before Solomon.  Putting the letter of the law in contradiction to the spirit of the law is hardly a novel concept; this is just one <i>possibly</i> novel example.  It's probably discussed in the Talmud somewhere.  ""Ah yes, the famous story of Francois the builder, who owed his brother Juan thirty-five rubles and agreed to repay him by shearing his sheep on the fifteenth day following the next new moon, knowing full well that the fifteenth day following the next new moon was a sabbath day, on which sheep-shearing was forbidden.""",1247561570

703331,comment,702713,703073,0,0,lsc,,,"key.  I mean, all my experience is with squid, but there are many, many caching proxies.  Using caching proxies is a ridiculously easy way for a SysAdmin to take a slow webapp and make it fast without screwing with the application code.<p>Unfortunately most webapp developers don't use reasonable cache control headers.   Most php apps, if your proxy does a HEAD to see if it should re-pull content, render a full page and throw it away except for the headers.  (this may be false now, but when I did this, they were using php3.   In php3, to handle HEAD requests properly you'd have to actually write code to handle it, which most programmers did not.)<p>Still, my experience has been that using something like squid gives you a pretty massive performance advantage, even when your webapp is uncooperative.",1247561531

I think this need has arisen because the use of HTML/CSS has gone well beyond minimalist content markup of documents, to full blown GUI websites (i.e. sites with complex navigation bars), which doesn't exactly transfer well onto mobile. I think this is why only the simplest of sites (i.e. blogs, text search engine results) will be able to display an alternate stylesheet for acceptable mobile presentation.<p>More complex sites would need a more tuned site (i.e. m.wikipedia.org - notice how the edit stuff is cut out for example)<p>ps- i hope i've understood your contention correctly :D",1247559647

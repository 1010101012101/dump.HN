This works for most people, they get that if it&#x27;s not important and time sensitive, they can email or text and I&#x27;ll get around to responding. And if it is important they can call. But some people insist that every little concern they have is urgent and when they learn that I don&#x27;t respond to texts immediately, they start calling for everything. The way I see it, these people aren&#x27;t respecting the importance of a phone call, so I screen their calls.<p>Calling me is literally ringing a bell and demanding I speak to you this instant.

It does not mean that their <i>marginal</i> cost to acquire an additional new customer is $6.59; if it were, they&#x27;d certainly go out and spend it as fast as they can until saturation.<p>In contrast, a hardware startup (or a software one, for that matter) just has to go out and hustle to get every single sale, whether through paid or non-paid customer acquisition channels.  This is where YC&#x27;s philosophy of treating hardware and software companies similarly works: they both usually have very similar customer acquisition challenges in rapidly building and scaling their growth channels (rather than, say, technical engineering challenges, which are very rarely the limiting factor in startups).",1440532417

It&#x27;s easist to see by doing a rundown of the Bill of Rights and pondering the actual troubles you&#x27;d face if you asserted them.<p>Badnarik&#x27;s constitutional law videos illustrate the process in the context of government affiliates (eg driving/RMV) better than I ever could. Although you have to interpret what he is saying with the goal of finding out how we got to this point, rather than falling into thinking you just need to assert your rights &quot;harder&quot; to regain freedom.<p>The same thing happens with the &quot;private&quot; sector - complexity grows and its effects on the individual remain unregulated because it does not conform to the simplitic base case of &quot;the government&quot; doing something, even when it has formed a de facto government.<p>For example, a person can&#x27;t exist without paying large rents, which necessitates they go contract for a &quot;job&quot;. This then controls what they can do even when not working. Historically this inconsistency was resolved by private behavior staying private, but we&#x27;re in a time of upset because pervasive communication has changed that.<p>Government applies a hazy justification of &quot;commerce&quot; to regulate absolutely everything. And the constructive behavior of this third &quot;commercial&quot; realm certainly impacts fundamental individual rights. But rather than longstanding &quot;constitutional&quot; rights being applied to the commercial realm, even more complexity is generated as half-baked adaptations are created to address the singular issues of the day. Back to my example of employment, someone can&#x27;t be fired for being gay but someone else can be fired for wearing a red sweater on Sunday.<p>Everyone dreams of being free of this yoke (eg &quot;FU money&quot;) and finds ways to push back in areas that really matter to them.

For our use case, there were a couple of blockers that prevented Redis from being a viable solution:<p>1. It&#x27;s tricky to scale out a Redis node when it gets too big. Because RDB files are just a single dump of all data, it&#x27;s not easy to make a specific partitioning of the dataset. This was a very important requirement for us in order to ease scaling (redis-cluster wasn&#x27;t ready yet -- we&#x27;ve been following that carefully).<p>2. When you store hundreds of GB of persistent data in Redis, the startup process can be very slow (restoring from RDB/AOF). Since it can&#x27;t serve reads or writes during this time, you&#x27;re unavailable (setting up a slave worsens the following problem).<p>3. The per-key overhead in Redis (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10004565/redis-10x-more-memory-usage-than-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10004565/redis-10x-more-m...</a>). We have many billions of sets that are often only a few elements in size -- think of slicing data by city or device type -- which means that the resulting overhead can be larger than the dataset itself.<p>If you think about these problems upfront, they&#x27;re not too difficult to solve for a specific use case (partition data on disk, allow reads from disk on startup), but Redis has to be generic and so can&#x27;t leverage the optimizations we made.",1440531059

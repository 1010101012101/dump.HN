I've had to resort to writing a bunch of code like that as well.<p>As an example of what I mean, there are some places where you can simplify by knowing that a relationship is 1:1 instead of 1:n because based on the current schema it's <i>impossible</i> for it not to be 1:1. You don't need an if/then or any logic in your application when you access that field.<p>This means if you want to make it 1:n you have to change the schema and deal with all of the code that will break due to that change. Once that is done, then your application can input lists of items into the storage.<p>In the document oriented approach, is seems like you (or any code touching the document type) just start inputting lists. This makes changing the schema a non-issue. It is up to the code pulling data to always assume the data could be null, single or a list of items.<p>In the couchDB model it seems the schema is implicitly defined by the behavior of the application. I don't really know what that means for the application. I'm sure the tradeoff is worth it in a lot of cases, I'm just saying that this is one of the parts where my imagination is failing me and the unknown-unknowns are great.<p>It seems like here the skills of writing a great REST API are more relevant than traditional data modeling skills.",1270796852

I skipped Safari entirely when I first got a Mac because I was used to FF on Windows. I tried out Safari after a friend suggested I do so. I've since moved to Chrome as my primary browser, but there was a buggy release (for me) that caused me to switch back for a while. I now try to avoid opening FF unless I absolutely need something in Firebug or the Web Developer Toolbar.<p>One plus to Chrome is the integrated search/URL bar, also. I've gotten so use to using the same bar for both, that I've had issues using other browsers when they try to visit some site that's actually my search query.<p>Firefox still has a place on my system, but it's definitely not something I want to use all the time.",1270796769

You didn't build something as a demo of your platform because it might piss off your competition and because you don't have time to build something on your platform?  How are you getting customers?  How are you building a community?  Honestly, it comes off that you're blowing smoke.",1270796601

Basically Flash was quickly becoming de facto way to access features that browsers couldn't access, it was a serious threat to every platform vendor, making OS commodity. HTML5 is catching up with Flash, but ain't yet there + there is inconsistency problem due to multiple browser implementations.",1270796596

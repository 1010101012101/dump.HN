I&#x27;d say the companies you&#x27;ve mentioned have a better case for sharing the full story since they all are publicly traded. Reddit, on the other hand, is a private company.<p>> But Reddit is run on donations<p>Although I feel a discussion is starting to go downhill the moment it focuses on semantics, I disagree that reddit runs on donations. Reddit gold is not a donation scheme; it&#x27;s a &quot;premium membership program&quot; [1]. There&#x27;s a clear list of benefits tied to a reddit gold account. Compare this with Wikimedia Foundation donations which offer no intrinsic benefits for donors. And it&#x27;s true that reddit community is responsible for keeping the company afloat. But if you think of them as loyal customers who buy a premium membership service, it&#x27;s not really different from other companies.<p>Plus, reddit doesn&#x27;t rely exclusively on premium memberships as their revenue. They also serve ads and sponsored links, and they have redditgifts Marketplace.<p>They indeed talked about opening ownership of the company up to their users. It hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but if it will I can see how the users deserve to know the details.<p>As of now? I don&#x27;t think they owe the users the full story.<p>1 - <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/gold/about"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/gold/about</a>",1416358678

8627526,comment,8625433,8626430,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"If you want to contrast compile speeds, try Go vs. C++. Java compilation has been very fast for a long time, as others point out.<p>For my part, my main beef with Go isn&#x27;t necessarily the lack of generics, but the obstinate lack of expressiveness. It&#x27;s back to Java or Python where you&#x27;re forced to break up your code into discrete, imperative chunks instead of chaining stuff together in elegant flows. It&#x27;s like Go&#x27;s authors missed out on functional programming. No pattern maching, which seems like a huge miss considering Go has select { }. Go&#x27;s syntax is, in many ways, even more rigid than both Java and Python.<p>That rigidity extends to error handling. While I agree with the <i>philosophy</i> behind Go&#x27;s rejection of exceptions, I don&#x27;t agree with how it&#x27;s been implemented. In discussions about Go people always talk about exceptions vs. explicit error returns, but hardly anyone mentions the fact that error handling completely takes over our code: errs are everywhere!<p>A concrete example: Go has := for type inference, but it turns out you can almost never use it, because almost every function needs an &quot;err&quot; that you end up declaring. Often you start out like this:<p><pre><code>    if result, err := getResults(); err != nil {
      return
    }
</code></pre>
Quite elegant. But then you need to add some more code, and you actually can&#x27;t rely on type inference anymore:<p><pre><code>    var err error
    var result *Result
    if result, err = getResults(); err != nil {
      return
    }
    stats, err = computeStats(result)
</code></pre>
It turns out that just because you needed another &quot;err&quot;, you had to rewrite the statement, which is frankly ridiculous.<p>The next problem here is that we can&#x27;t simply this:<p><pre><code>    result, err := computeStats(getResults())
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s because computeStats() takes a <i>Result, not two arguments (Result</i>, error). In functional languages, this is elegantly solved through monads, but not in Go; you can&#x27;t &quot;short circuit&quot; function chains that might return errors. There goes your expressiveness.<p>Another problem that the error phenomenon infects the language with is that you can&#x27;t have global variables initialized this way:<p><pre><code>    var spaces := regexp.Compile(`^foo`)
</code></pre>
To get around this, the regexp module defines an alternative function:<p><pre><code>    var spaces := regexp.MustCompile(`^foo`)
</code></pre>
(Never mind the fact that you&#x27;re not allowed to declare this as a const. It <i>is</i> a constant, I want it to be a constant, not a global variable!)<p>The fact that almost <i>every</i> function ends up having an &quot;err&quot; around raises the question: Why is it not an integral part of the language in the first place? Why do <i>I</i> have to declare err?<p>Other languages (Swift among them) fix this problem through sum types: The function can return a value which is <i>either</i> a real value or an error. Go&#x27;s idea of returning a value <i>and</i> an error is logically nonsensical in almost every case, because the error is used to signify that the value isn&#x27;t available due to failure. I&#x27;m not a language-theory purist who thinks everyone should really be using Haskell; these are <i>practical</i> concerns.<p>Overall, Go does feels disturbingly warty in places, which is incredible for a new, clean-slate language. Favourite wart: interface types being magically pointer-based, leading to the whole non-nil value being nil idiocy; it&#x27;s mindblowing that they got this so wrong.<p>I liked Go a lot better before I started using it.",1416358553

8627522,comment,8625831,8625831,0,0,westoncb,,,"I&#x27;ve been devoting myself for a while now to an approach to thinking that seems along the lines of Grothendieck&#x27;s project (as described in the blog), where difficulty should only come in defining the framework to work within, while work within the framework is easy.<p>In defining a framework, fundamentally you are coming up with a set of types and describing how things of these types are able to interact with one another; if it&#x27;s a framework that&#x27;s easy to work with, the number of types, relations, and operations is small (relative to other formulations). If this framework is concise, but the universe of things described by it is large, then the types must be very general. Therefore, using an approach of finding an elegant framework, rather than mastering the complexity of an inelegant framework, relies heavily on one&#x27;s ability to generalize.<p>My issue with spending a lot of time thinking this way is that it gives me a sort of uneasy feeling... What are these super abstract generalizations? From what I can tell, this mostly comes from wondering whether with all this &#x27;zooming out&#x27; we are getting closer to truths about the universe, or our own minds—and the latter possibility feels a little suffocating.<p>Anyone know any books, essays, whatever taking up that issue?",1416358518

[...] The Sumerian word for &#x27;mind,&#x27; or &#x27;wisdom,&#x27; is identical to the word for &#x27;ear.&#x27; That&#x27;s all those people were: ears with bodies attached.

I suspect that he was lonely, being one of the few--perhaps the only--conscious human being in the world.&quot; [...]<p>> &quot;Some probably did [die].

Unfortunately, the rotten apples are usually the most visible and make the whole community look bad.<p>Here&#x27;s what I see is needed to help solve some of these problems:<p>1. More transparency into the affiliate marketing channel. Startups need to feel comfortable knowing that they are not working with affiliates that use unauthorized marketing methods and messaging.<p>2. Affiliates need to be more comfortable knowing that they are not going to be cut out once a business sees the successful methods being used by affiliates to drive sales, leads, growth etc. Teespring&#x27;s model actually does a lot to protect affiliates and the designers that use their platform because the interests of both parties are closely aligned.<p>3. Startups need more education about the affiliate marketing community and the best ways to leverage affiliates as a traction channel. It&#x27;s unfortunate, but the comment from @dsugarman is a perfect example of what can go wrong while Teespring shows what can go right. They basically turned every single person who designs a shirt on their platform into an affiliate, and gave them all the tools and support they needed to succeed.",1416357815

It would be a perpetual disaster, with the North falling back apart, languishing from quasi-dictatorship to quasi-dictatorship.<p>The difference between South Korea lifting itself up over 20 or 30 years, and what&#x27;s going to happen with North Korea, is responsibility and imbalance. South Korea is going to end up assuming immense responsibility for the well-being of the people in the North, rather than the North existing as its own country; and the South will be massively rich by comparison, that imbalance will draw out very large sums of subsidization in the process of bringing the North up to speed to the South&#x27;s standards --- there was no such scenario with the South when it originally climbed up out of poverty, no stark comparison amongst their own people essentially. It will be viewed as very unacceptable to have the people of North Korea with a per capita GDP of $10,000 after 20 years, while the South perhaps has a $50,000 per capita GDP at that time.

This intersection cohort -- call it &quot;People who like WSJ and can&#x27;t navigate paywalls&quot; -- is probably a decent size, but it leaves a lot of would-be customers on the table.

In comparison efficient dynamic languages like lisp, scheme, lua or javascript and many others not so well known do exist. Mine, potion, is also in the lua category, and not in the slow PPPR (python, perl, php, ruby) category.<p>The seminal paper about efficient dynamic interpreters is Ertl&#x27;s &quot;The Structure and Performance of Efficient Interpreters&quot; <a href=""http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/papers/ertl%26gregg03jilp.ps.gz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/papers/ertl%26gregg03jilp.p...</a><p>The abstract is:
&quot;Interpreters designed for high general-purpose performance typically perform a large number of indirect branches (3.2%–13% of all executed instructions in our benchmarks). These branches consume more than half of the run-time in a number of configurations we simulated. We evaluate how accurate various existing and proposed branch prediction schemes are on a number of interpreters, how the mispredictions affect the performance of the interpreters and how two different interpreter implementation techniques perform with various branch predictors. We also suggest various ways in which hardware designers, C compiler writers, and interpreter writers can improve the performance of interpreters.&quot;<p>My own input to this is that the GC, the JIT, the calling convention and esp. the size of the datastructures and ops do matter more, than eliminating the type checks.",1416355548

At least, there&#x27;s no evidence in your post that shows it. Probably, you have no idea.<p>Without a helmet, your effective head is &quot;smaller&quot;, I know that in an accident of mine - where everyone said &quot;thank god for your helmet&quot; am I certain that the part of the helmet hanging out the back hit the ground, and without the helmet, my head probably wouldn&#x27;t have touched.<p>As a long-term bicycist and a long-term motorcyclist (serious crashes in each), I am increasingly skeptical about the technology in current bicycle helmets, especially compared to the technology in my current motorcycle helmets. Bicycle helmets are simply not tested to the same standards. They use very hard shells. They extend the &quot;impact radius&quot; --- basically, your head becomes bigger --- with only some decrease in crash absorbancy.<p>Reading the literature, it seems that the current bicycle designs are based on voodoo more than good science. The designs look like what bicycle racers used 30 years ago (little leather padded strips).<p>Compare this to the motorcycle helmet industry. There are plenty of crashes to analyze, mostly of motorcycle racers. There are numerous standards (like SNELL) which measure levels of transient G force within the brain on a simulated head.<p>We deserve better bicycle helmets, and people are willing to pay for good science and proof of protection. I pay a LOT of money for my motorcycle helmet, and glad to do so. I would pay 4x the price of a current bicycle helmet to buy one with solid, verified science and an international standard behind it.<p>In my suspicion, the lack of good bicycle helmet science is why the upper level numbers are bad: helmets don&#x27;t decrease injuries or deaths, except that they cause people not to ride.<p>Really, we deserve better helmets.",1416355363

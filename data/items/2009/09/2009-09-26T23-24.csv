People will think the red has something to do with the button and will be confused.<p>I also suspect that you haven't thought this through. Try mocking up a page full of red arrows instead of red dots. Even without doing so myself, I predict that because the arrows have twice the area of the dots you'll find that it looks far <i>more</i> cluttered.<p>Meanwhile, my bikeshedding alarm is flashing. ;)",1254009565

846247,comment,845905,846189,0,0,cubedice,,,"Hmm, you definitely have a point. People have rarely felt musicians should be paid (a lot) for their self-expression; I can't really recall when it was a lucrative career.  What I suppose I meant was that the best musicians have often (though not always) been poor business people.<p>You're also right that sometimes they deserve to be paid.  It is my intuition that the free market works against supporting the largest number of musicians.  It may work to reward the best, but to me, that doesn't foster innovation (since musicians rarely look at the payoff in terms of money--probably fame).  Certain acts are always going to be very famous, but there probably is a lot of room for diversity.<p>The optimal strategy for creativity/diversity would be to provide a (minimal) amount of reimbursement for attempting to create music.  This would not only bring music creation back to the masses (where it probably should be) but could also provide an incentive for creative people to put work out and also buy dinner.",1254006503

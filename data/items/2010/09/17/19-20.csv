Some quick googleing puts wheat in the 1% efficient range or less when converting light into carbohyrates.  I have no idea where to find the exact number but it's not efficient at all.  In a controlled environment the remaining 99% of the energy could be recycled.

The optimistic thought experiment exists largely in the mind. The vistas of the mind are not always the same as reality.""<p>Fair enough, Thiel, but aren't your doomsayer projections also a direct form of thought experiment, based on extrapolation just the same?<p>He goes on to outline what he thinks are three defining markets (or distortions thereof) that could utterly define the future (""China"", ""Internet"" and ""hedge funds""), and claims that the markets are woefully out of alignment with reality. I think we have to take his view with a large grain of salt here, considering his bias: he's a global macro hedge fund manager who also invests in Internet startups.<p>I think he's probably right about a lot of the distortion and possibly right about some of the importance of these markets, but he doesn't even mention any other possible contenders (energy industry transformation? nanotech? biotech? government competition?). I think it's a mistake to assume that any one or three factors will determine the mid-term future when there are literally trillions of factors in play. Then the logical conclusion is that we can't really know or predict anything about the mid-term future, which may be largely right, but I think there is possibility to predict with narrow foci, like ""What will happen in transistor design?"" or ""What will happen in nuclear reactor design?""; though those too will always be hampered by revolutions that we never see coming.<p>Overall, I hope Thiel is wrong about a lot for the reasons that he so adeptly explains: there's not much else to hope for if the alternative to what you want is total destruction and nonexistence.",1284752616

If you watch the TED video referenced in the blog post, the YT representative speaks about the JK wedding video [1] as a vehicle for getting the Chris Brown song back onto the charts.  She also points out that The Office ""parodied"" the video for their season finale. I'm seeing a bit of a disconnect here - it's as though she's making an argument to the studios and record labels: let users make use of your content and you'll get free ideas for TV shows and better sales of old songs. Aside from getting on talk shows and raising a small sum for charity, what did the wedding party receive for their creative efforts copied verbatim by The Office?<p>Perhaps an alternate strategy would be the following: a fixed dollar amount of revenue generated would go to the copyright owner to cover a licensing cost for the content in question, with any additional amount going to the creative individual(s) who in all likelihood have a fair use of the content in the first place. The YT rep speaks of culture and joy, but watching others benefit financially from one's creative efforts is the surest way to smother such expression.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.jkweddingdance.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jkweddingdance.com/</a>",1284752384

Most of these supposed superiorities are just plugins that the author likes that would work just as well in a Python framework, or straw-men. Call it, ""Things I like about Ruby/Rails"" and were cool. Frame it as ""your language sucks"" and it all comes off as fanboyism. I like Rails, but Django/Python works the way I do.<p>Saying that easy_install is ""all kinds of broken"" but in the next breath saying ""Luckily there is Pip and Virtualenv"" is a self-defeating argument. As it is, Ruby is well behind pip/virtualenv and the environmental isolation it gives you. And fabric / pip / virtualenv is a killer combo that makes deployment fast and easy. Rails has a Gemfile. pip has a stable-requirements.txt file. It's not rocket science.<p>Yes, Rake is great. Lots of things Python and Ruby projects can learn from one another. Rails 3 owes a whole lot to Django.<p>Haml/Sass: Meh. I don't need yet another layer of abstraction. But if I wanted to use these in Python, it would be trivial to do so. To each his own.<p>ActiveRecord vs Django: Use SQLAlchemy if you don't like the existing alternatives. It supports schema reflection just fine. As it is, lots if not most Django apps are written together with their database schema, and migrated together using South. For most projects, this is identical to how Rails is used.<p>Form Handling: I can use a ModelForm in Django, and do no mapping whatsoever. Accessing a Post dictionary is just as easy as a magically created attribute on a class. It's not that hard.<p>Templating: Jinja2 lets me import functions and class instances directly into a template's context, and thus keeps code where it belongs. Talk about religion all you want, but I actually work on projects that need a healthy separation between display and controller logic. Excellent coders that are also excellent designers are so rare that I have never met one. Every successful project I have been involved in has had excellent coders working with excellent designers who knew enough of one another's environments to work well together.<p>URL routes: Give me Regex any day!<p>Misc other supposed pluses: Cherry-picking.

Keeping that history around is cheap (we're talking about a few megabytes over the life of a given system), and can be invaluable in figuring out the how and why of a particular change even months later.<p>It also serves the purpose of making a best-effort attempt at gathering who ""owned"" that session (ie. who su'd to root); with multiple admins, this can be pretty handy. It's easily bypassed (and console logins will just show up as ""root""), so using this as any kind of audit system would be ridiculous; it's just a useful way of going back in time to see who did what (usually looking of work I did myself, to see how/why I might have made a particular change months ago).<p>The one downside: you lose cross-session history. In practice, especially with multiple users accessing a shared account (multiple admins, etc), this hasn't really bothered me much, as getting someone else's history is annoying anyway.

Source Sure (or whatever) really, really sucks, and it's bogus that interviewing for a job should be more time consuming and paperwork intensive than my taxes, and complete with an audit.  You don't have to go full-out Fog Creek on your interview process or anything, but I think taking the arrangements back in-house would do wonders for you guys.<p>Other than that, it'd be cool if I could be convinced that I would work on something interesting and meaningful without having to watch out for Office Politics and mismanagement (what I was overwhelming warned about by former full-time employees as well as former interns).  It is my sincere hope that such bubbles exist within Microsoft for at least a small portion of your developers.",1284750248

If you watch the documentary, you will understand what I am saying.<p>Also, the hope is that vaccination will become unnecessary in the future, for example, smallpox vaccines are not being administered anymore, because it has been eradicated completely.  That is not the case with many other preventable diseases (there are many areas in the world where they still occur, and so it is necessary to exercise caution).<p>There might be some legit concern as far as simultaneous vaccination for several diseases goes, though, but that is not sufficient reason to endanger the larger population until the (possible) causal relationship between vaccines and brain damage is firmly established.",1284750162

On the down side, this trust of application processes to manage themselves could lead to a misbehaving application bringing down the server.</i>""<p>If true, memory protection without preemptive multitasking is still basically unacceptable (just not something you can base a healthy <i>server</i> ecosystem on; we had enough ""fun"" of that sort with non-preemptive 16 bit Windows client).<p>The article also notes that TCP/IP was a second class citizen at best until Netware 5.x in October 1998, ""during a time when NetWare market share dropped precipitously....""<p>In general it notes Netware's kernel had a big speed advantage which became less important as systems steadily became faster (and I suspect its tunable caching became less useful).",1284750055

1482503,comment,1482162,1482162,0,0,agiledude,,,"The reality that I saw, when I was an on-site coordinator for one of the big three companies of India: When the project starts, you have 1-2 experienced people on the team who are really good - these are the ones that are sent initially to interface with the customer, get requirements and set the tone of the project. After the project is on its way, when additional members are needed, the team is staffed with rookies - actually I have actually encountered that ""We'll give you 2 for the cost of 1"". No need to say, that employees on-site are forbidden to code as it is ""too expensive"". Thus most of the code that ends up being written is done by poor 6-month or less experienced beginners. No wonder the code sucks. The insane amount of cost cutting shortcuts that these companies employ may be the main reason why most of the out-sourced projects fail. Just my 2c",1278107875

I put myself through college (in Colorado) freelancing on Rent-a-Coder(now vWorker) and Scriptlance, doing web development and system administration.  I started at $25/hr, and worked up to $75/hr by the time I called it quits (got a job at Google).<p>The key to doing well on these sites is to spend the time to prove to potential clients why you're worth paying a higher rate.  The best way I found to do this was to ask lots of questions about what people wanted, describe in detail how I'd go about solving their problem, and do my best to show that I really cared about building them what they needed, not just what they thought they needed.  I did all this before I would quote them a price.<p>It's also key to be choosy about what jobs you bid on - you'll need to spend at least an hour per job you bid on, so you'll want to make sure to choose ones that are going to be worth your time.<p>Lastly, view jobs that you get through these sites as interviews.  I found that once I'd done a project or two with people through the site, we usually were able to work out an arrangement where they just paid me directly by the hour for further work.  The money I made outside of the sites with established clients was by far the majority of the money I made.",1278107553

There was a long, foreshortened espresso counter up front. The rest of the concrete floor was dotted with wooden tables, dozens of them, all different shapes, spaced evenly through the field of gray. Every single one was occupied. Men in shiny suits and long coats—one in white New Fleet livery—milled from table to table like customers at a flea market.<p><i>[...]</i><p>All of the tables at this coffee shop were reserved for new internet companies. The price was a nine percent stake in your new venture, but you’d happily give nineteen or ninety-nine. With a table, you got, in addition to the simple, precious space: a thick, luxurious fiber-optic connection to the internet; a server or two or sixteen in the data center next door; and, most important by far, the attention of Octav Erdos.<p>I saw him at a table near the front. He was tall and wide, bald, wearing gray overalls. He could have been an auto mechanic. He was blustering at the semicircle of skinny faces around the table, tracing his fingers in little spirals, drawing something in the air. Everyone was nodding.<p>Octav was more than an espresso impresario. He was also the director of Black Danube Ventures, and he spent every waking hour of every day here in his camouflaged incubator, migrating from table to table, advising, cajoling, berating. Sometimes even coding. When you got a table, you held on to it. You crowded as many people around it as you could. You took shifts in sleeping bags. And you subsisted on Octav’s pitch-black brew.<p>When a company got sold, or graduated into an office of its own, Octav ceremonially smashed an espresso cup across its table. The dinged-up, dark-brown tables were the lucky ones.<p>-----<p>The story is set, of course, in San Francisco.",1278107266

It's a very common argument tactic whenever someone defends Lisp or Scheme: ""everyone else simply don't get it.""<p>There was a recent article posted here about people assuming, by default, that they are smarter than everyone else.  Lisp has had over 50 years to prove that it can be used to develop software better than all the alternatives and it's still less successful attracting developers than languages just a few years old.  It appears the previous commenter is just assuming he knows something that 99.9999% of other developers don't.<p>I don't advocate any particular language or platform for all possible solutions.  Sometimes Java is right choice, sometimes PHP, sometimes C#, Python, etc.  And whether or not a developer <i>knows</i> the language is a large factor but it's not the overriding factor.  Trying to shoe-horn in a language of choice into every situation is a recipe for disaster.  Sometimes it's necessary to learn a platform/language to effectively tackle certain tasks.

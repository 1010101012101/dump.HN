8385267,comment,8381086,8383827,2,0,wtallis,,,"Verizon sells their service to their customers under the terms of providing a &quot;best effort&quot; to reach the advertised speeds. Fulfilling a promise of &quot;best effort&quot; does not require attaining the advertised speeds to every endpoint, but it does require <i>some</i> effort. Given that Level 3 has offered to pay all of the equipment and labor costs of upgrading the peering connection, and Verizon has stated that their network is not congested internally, what Verizon is refusing to do is literally the smallest possible non-zero effort that they could make towards alleviating the congestion.<p>Nobody is calling for anything that would fail to be &quot;respecting property rights&quot;. Verizon is not fulfilling their obligations to their own customers; that needs to be corrected. Changing the regulatory landscape to remove the perverse incentives that have led to Verizon&#x27;s misbehavior is a bigger and separate project.",1412024372

8385263,comment,8383422,8384491,1,0,jrells,,,"I think I understand where you&#x27;re coming from, economics is a form of culture, but I was trying to distinguish the cold economic price of low-skilled labor from the non-economic value we place on it (sorry I don&#x27;t know a better way to express this). Hard work is generally considered very important and valuable in our culture, but excess supply and low demand drives down the economic value. I value water very highly (non-economically), more than gold, but the economy disagrees.<p>You could say employers are greedy and hoard excess profits while keeping wages low, or you could say that they generously provide much needed jobs to a struggling low-skill labor market. Both are true. It would be nice if low-skilled labor drew higher wages, but wages above the economic rate are just another form of charity. You don&#x27;t compromise your value of hard work by choosing to pay low wages, you just lack charity.",1412024334

This is because advertisers and other third-parties were beginning to use wifi hotspots as passive ways of collecting unique IDs for devices (their MAC addresses). So under this system, when it works, walking by a hotspot shouldn&#x27;t identify you to it if you don&#x27;t auto connect, while actually connecting would.<p>Edit: from their previous post:<p>In iPhone 5s, MAC randomization happens only under the following conditions:\nPhone is in sleep mode (display off, not being used);\nWi-Fi should be ON but not associated\n...<p>I would argue that the phone needing to be in sleep is also a bug.

The noise in the training data itself, noise from dropout and various other sources are going to trump any quantization noise anyway, so you can use fairly inaccurate representations.

If you buy MDMA from a vendor with a 4.9/5 rating, you can be reasonably certain you&#x27;re getting quality product (comparable to old pressed pills you can hear aging ravers wax nostalgic about) at a fair price.<p>I expect marijuana legalization will eat away at darknet marketplace weed sales, leaving MDMA and LSD as the top two. Which is exactly how it should be. They can be made in large quantities by moderately-skilled chemists to a high degree of purity and safety, and the Silk Road allows them to be distributed without any violence. It&#x27;d be impossible to bulk-search the mail for them. MDMA could be packaged as any white powder and LSD is literally paper.<p>I hope that this safe availability of MDMA and LSD quenches the misinformation campaigns that have so horribly marred their reputation for the public. Both of them have incredible potential for therapeutic and recreational use.",1412023647

I don&#x27;t take issue with Scala&#x27;s choice of square brackets over angled brackets. I take issue with the language philosophy and combined set of features. Here are the most detailed details: too many features, many of them overlapping (traits, structural types); too much complexity (type system, implicits); less readable; not enough constraints (e.g. immutability not enforced, casts allowed everywhere). That&#x27;s as detailed as it gets. All in all, it came out benefits << cost. That&#x27;s it.<p>Either you don&#x27;t want to understand or you think that when Boeing wants to write some big aircraft software thingy they say, &quot;hmmm., the type inference is insufficient for our needs&quot;, or, &quot;if only we had non-strict evaluation...&quot;. Because that&#x27;s not how it works. In the industry languages are evaluated as a whole based on the project&#x27;s criteria, with all their combined benefits weighed against their combined costs. This is what we&#x27;ve done. Scala came out lacking: too much overall cost for too little overall benefit. It was too complicated, too unconstraining, too unreadable, and too difficult to upgrade and build. What more do you want?<p>> &quot;not a version which would give any useful information to judge Scala today&quot;<p>No, I&#x27;m sorry, but you&#x27;re just plain wrong! I gave up on Scala some years ago, but I can still tell its evolution has been in the opposite direction from what we wanted. Since then the language has become even bigger, more complex, more obtuse (collections) and even less constraining (macros). Even if the build and upgrade issues are better, the PL research philosophy is still there and its effects are only worse than they were some years ago.",1412023619

I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it. Go look at the list of things a CA has to do to be considered trustable by the major root store operators (operating system vendors, browser makers). It&#x27;s not trivial.<p>2) The original reason was because it was assumed (correctly) that due to hardware improvements keys that were previously strong would become weak. So it was supposed to encode a length of time after which the cert owner would be forced to re-evaluate key strength. Nowadays the browser makers are tending to lean on CAs to push expiry times downwards so they expire quicker, the reason being that updating the SSL ecosystem often requires new features or changes in certificates, and if certs can last 5 years then it means a full upgrade takes 5 years, whereas if certs expire after one year then one year after deployment begins everyone is updated. Pretty big difference. It&#x27;s for this reason that EV certs are specced to expire after a year:  it means standards can be revved quicker.",1412023582

Currently, we believe that the limiting factor preventing a &quot;link graph&quot; from existing across apps, is the challenge developers face in discovering how to find (a) which pieces of content are relevant to a page within your app, and (b) how to contruct a deep link URL to send users to those pieces of content.",1412023389

Via changes to OpenGL version 3.0 through 3.2, it became possible to ask for specific <i>versions</i> of OpenGL for each context. There are two kinds of contexts: &quot;compatibility&quot; contexts, which expose all OpenGL features up to the version obtained, and &quot;core&quot; contexts, which don&#x27;t have deprecated features. For example, starting with 3.1, a core context won&#x27;t draw quads - you have to split them into two triangles.<p>On Linux, Racket uses libgtkgl to get OpenGL contexts that are associated with GTK widgets.

As the demand in Vancouver grows, the prices rise, and they continue to rise as high as the market will bear.<p>Unfortunately, when the market consists of Vancouverites making the average wage here, and also wealthy Chinese businesspeople with hundreds of millions to spend, that directly affects the market.<p>There is currently a condo development called Vancouver House being built in the densely-packed (for Canada) downtown core (which is also a peninsula, limiting growth and densification), which is being marketed specifically to the rich – so much so that when it was time to start shopping the properties around to buyers, the developers went straight to their target market: rich investors overseas, e.g. in Singapore and elsewhere. Even if you were an equally rich investor in Vancouver, they weren&#x27;t offered here.<p>Vancouver House is, of course, absurd luxury, the kind that only the rich can afford to own (and maintain), and it makes sense; turn that plot of land into housing that the locals can (and are willing to) afford, and you&#x27;re looking at selling for up to a million per unit. Gear the entire property towards the world&#x27;s wealthy elite, and you can build units five times the size that will go for twenty times the price or more - and guarantee a higher class of owner, who will treat their property with respect (or, more likely, leave it empty for now).<p>Welcoming the absurdly wealthy into the economy without any checks or balances results in a rising cost of living without necessarily seeing a rise in the standard of living or in average wages. Property managers start doing renovictions (mass-evictions, allowed under local law if done for the purposes of renovating the building) so that they can upscale their clientele and double their prices. High-end shops crowd out the cheaper ones (Pacific Centre, the Vancouver mall with the highest revenue per square foot in Canada, started evicting the &#x27;normal&#x27; stores like EB Games/Gamestop, as well as several shoe and clothing stores, in favour of high-end brands such as Victoria&#x27;s Secret and Sephora).<p>Pushing people out of the downtown core will raise the value of the surrounding land, spurring further development. Prices there will rise, forcing those people further out, in a ripple effect. The further out you force the average Vancouverite, the more transit problems you have (as you&#x27;re still dealing with the same number of transit users, but you have to provide better service in the suddenly-denser neighbourhoods as well as others), and the more traffic issues you have as more people need to drive further to get to work (which in turn causes problems for transit, etc.).<p>So, to answer your general question, yes, it can cause a significant problem if property developers devote all their energy to making more and more ridiculous luxury for the sole purposes of selling it to foreign investors who will leave them empty for years, while Vancouver already has rapidly rising housing prices that Vancouverites can barely afford, and when there&#x27;s already a huge affordable housing crisis contributing to the city&#x27;s homelessness.",1412023331

But I did live there in the summer of 2005 teaching in Nanning (the former industrial hub running south to Vietnam, not Nanning the tourist trap).<p>Others have described the phenomenon.  Rich Chinese families would hire white kids as tokens; tutors who lived with their children to teach their offspring &quot;real English.&quot;  I was not an exception; I found even a few in the same city.<p>The family I lived with was one of the richer families in my region.  I thought the father ran a mid-level pharam company.  Then I visited the site/office.  It was a huge.  Then people pointed out ads for this company on national Chinese TV, and billboards in other region on a family trip in the next province over and way south in Beihai (is that what it&#x27;s called, maybe HNers can remind of the most southern Chinese beach areas near Vietnam; I forget).  I found out he was a moghul for one of the biggest emerging pharma companies in the region.  Guy had a 7 series BWM with televisons built in, and a differenr Rolex for every day and a duplex penthouse apartment in the super wealth part of town.<p>So why all the background info?  This guy visited America, when he saw me at lesst, twice after this in the following five years.  They talked about moving to the US repeatedly (the reason my language tutoring was relevant at the time).  But it never happened.  Even by the time I was there, post-9/11 backlash had fucked many Chinese over.  Visa restrictions made things a nuissance, and the wealthy grew sick of it.  Some of the kids from other families even moved to Australia, the new it place, because at least &quot;they were not American with their visa and residency regimes.&quot;  The wife had been blacklisted for no reason at all; attorney friends had contacts at the US Embassy, and was told she was put on a list after the interview phase with a black mark like &quot;do not approve residency visa bc this woman is shady.&quot;  Why the meek wife (who was a stay at home mom her whole life) and no one else in the family is a mystery to me.<p>This dude could have opened up businesses to the tune of 500K bank deposits, according to my attorney dad, and naturalize very quickly, and the other lawyers who wanted to help and get an in to the business he would put out for them.  He did not, and others did not either.  The US had already become toxic.  They invested in our economy, but they would even ask me to explain why we so were worth it economically to them, but the USG would routinely fuck around with rhetoric and policy clash with China.  &quot;We are your economic friends, why treat us like enemies?&quot;  (Obviously both sides are complete disallusionment with the other if they really believe this.)<p>So, none of those people moved.  They invested all damn day in US and Western business, but only enough to get paid and avoided &quot;the dream&quot; of moving to the West as elites, being prestigious (as those to even have the opportunity).<p>Ironically, as a nation, we earned our devalution abroad.  People will buy from us, but no one wants to be US (that is a joke, enjoy).",1412022666

In North America they are more of a nuisance than a deadly threat, but the same does not hold true for large portions of the world where they are a major disease vector. They are unquestionably worth eradicating if it ever becomes feasible to do so.<p>The question should not be whether or not we should eliminate the species of mosquitoes that feed on humans.  Instead, we should ask how can we minimize the impact of eliminating these species.  Can other species of mosquitoes that are not disease vectors, or other insects entirely, fill in the vacated niche?

There&#x27;s nothing worse in the world then being &quot;secure&quot; at a job working on a codebase you hate--every day, seeing the madness and pointless mud piling up and piling up. In many cases, the company and culture is worse off if you can&#x27;t readjust teams to retain the people who fit and let go the people who want (or need) gone.<p>Is it because of wages? <i>Somewhat</i>. As programmers, we shoulder a disproportionate part of the responsibility for delivering value to customers and if we do it properly we end up with a product that scales with little intervention. Accordingly, we should reap a better share of the long-term profits. At the same time, even if you aren&#x27;t in vastly over-inflated talent markets as on the coasts, we generally aren&#x27;t paid too badly--unless you are in a town were the profession isn&#x27;t respected, in which case you are getting shafted repeatedly.<p>Is it because of work conditions? <i>Yes</i>. We work a very sedentary job. Many shops expect/require bullshit-long hours and at weird times, and few promote life/balance with anything more than a wink and a nod. There is a large amount of stress involved with our work, especially as deadlines draw near or as code rot becomes apparent. Cognitive dissonance is great, because we aren&#x27;t allowed to lie to ourselves about reality: we can&#x27;t, because computers don&#x27;t deal in lies. Bad code is bad, sales features promised don&#x27;t exist unless there&#x27;s code backing them up.<p>Is it because of professionalism? <i>Yes</i>. I can pick a &quot;programmer&quot; out of a set of 100, even from a good school or respected company, and still fin glaring omissions in what they know and how they practice. There&#x27;s no quality control in what people describing themselves as software engineers or programmers know, and so hiring becomes annoying.

If nobody else around him had a phone, he just would get on life without making that phone call, or he would wait until he found a landline to make that call. But if the convenience already exists, he&#x27;ll use it.<p>He&#x27;s actually quite internally self-consistent. The principle he&#x27;s adhering to is (1) he doesn&#x27;t want to be tracked himself but (2) if someone else is already tracked, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily track him. He still thinks you should choose to not be tracked yourself, but if you already made the choice to carry a phone, it&#x27;s too late.<p>He will use servers or devices which aren&#x27;t entirely free software because it&#x27;s not practical to modify them. This is why he makes a big distinction between free software and hackable hardware. He considers these to be two different things. He believes that once you have the actual device and it&#x27;s modifiable, you should be allowed to modify it. If the device is soldered and hardwired from the beginning, then it&#x27;s simply impractical to require that hardware manufacturers allow you to modify it. This is why originally free BIOS wasn&#x27;t such a big deal, until all BIOS became flashable, so now Coreboot is one of the causes of the FSF.<p>Saying that he will use any server that runs non-free software is a simplification of his position. He considers that sometimes you are merely being provided a service, and you should consider the conditions under which this service is provided. That&#x27;s why he eschews the word &quot;cloud&quot;, because it conflates a bunch of different things and makes people stop thinking about their relationship to a server. He does think that merely requesting a web page from a server running, say, Microsoft Server is ok, because that&#x27;s just information the server is sending him, and it doesn&#x27;t matter how that information got generated. He might consider that Microsoft Server would harm the sysadmins using it, not him.<p>His positions make sense. He&#x27;s a huge aspie, so he spends a lot of time making sure everything he says falls into place logically. Part of his aspie condition is that he has tantrums and eats toe cheese. You should view those acts as that: a condition he has to live with.

It has to do with a fundamental aspect of the Windows architecture: The OS holds your applications hostage.<p>In the DOS era applications had a huge degree of independence from the OS. You could nuke the OS, upgrade it, modify it and move machines and your apps worked just the same.<p>Today things are different.  The OS, by means of such &quot;features&quot; as te registry, holds applications hostage.<p>Say I have a five year old machine. I want to purchase (or more than likely, build) a new machine.  In the past this was relativley painless. Once the machine is up you move your apps and off you go. Today this requires full re-installation of apps from scratch.  It&#x27;s a nightmare and it is one I contend has significant economic consequences.  Whereas someone like me might consider upgrading hardware every year or two, the financial math now includes the non trivial time and expense of reinstalling everything.<p>We&#x27;ve done this a few times. With typical high end engineering workstations full of software it can easily take a month of installing and configuring software to get back to the setup you had before he upgrade.  This isn&#x27;t pallatable at all from more than one perspective.  And so machines continue to be used as long as possible before upgrading anything that might trigger a reinstallation event.<p>To me this is a major flaw in the design of Windows.  OS, applications and data ought to be fully separable independent entities.  I get all the advantages of DLL reuse and centralized settings, etc.  I still contend that this could be achieved at the cost of additional storage and some more smarts.  A one terabyte hard drive is about $60 today.  I could not care less if DLL&#x27;s need to be duplicated for each software installation in order to break lose from the OS and registry as much as possible.<p>The point is, if they are smart they ought to be able to figure it out.  I ought to be able to install all my apps on a portable USB drive, walk up to any machine in the world, plug in and have my tools and files available for use instantly.

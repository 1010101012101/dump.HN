I&#x27;m told by my former coworkers that my standard US egalitarianism was quite unusual. By &quot;egalitarianism&quot;, I simply mean &quot;I&#x27;m CTO, you are a mechanical turk, we can go eat pancakes and you aren&#x27;t obligated to make me tea&quot;. So were my efforts to ensure that everyone was growing in their career. My feminist sensibilities (&quot;so be late, tell your husband to make dinner&quot;) were also a bit scandalous [1].<p>I came back to India a month ago to attend the wedding of someone I worked with, and I was very surprised to hear all that.

Sometimes money comes with the silly unskilled white college kid labor and well maybe the white college kids get to play soccer with the village kids while the local skilled labor build the schools.<p>> Why would you feel better because a foreigner is coming and fucking shit up<p>Well I do have a story for you. I grew up on a country were American volunteers also felt the need to come and &quot;teach us&quot; and &quot;work with us&quot;. Nowhere near the situation in Africa. Nevertheless,  I remember kids in our school chasing down Americans just to look at them as if they were from Mars or something. Rumors were how they distributed chewing gum and candy. I never got the candy I was too shy. Well now I live here in US, can buy tons of candy, and looking back, it just feels so stupid to do that. But I am glad they came and didn&#x27;t just stay home.

7303183,comment,7302645,7302645,33,0,PakG1,,,"I have volunteered regularly to run children&#x27;s summer English camps in rural China.  The point of these camps is mostly to give the kids an opportunity to have fun and learn some English while they&#x27;re at it, because such nice opportunities simply don&#x27;t exist where they are.  Camp counselors in North America for summer camps don&#x27;t go through extensive counseling training either.  The bar for such volunteer activity is lower, but the bar should be much higher in other cases.  Here are some things I&#x27;ve learned about non-profit organizations that are well-run.<p>Firstly, well-run organizations want to maximize their ROI.  The volunteers usually fundraise for donations or pay out of their own pocket to go on these trips.  Essentially, these funds are revenue for the organization.  That revenue must then be invested into their business, as their purpose is not to make a profit (hence non-profit), but rather, accomplish their goals to make the world a better place in their specific way.  As such, a good organization will get tourists who are qualified to do the work that needs to be done.<p>The organization with whom I volunteer has multiple programs in medicine, agriculture, construction, education, and local skills training (for local professionals for the above categories).  They ensure that the people who are volunteering are qualified to do their work.  For example, for my most recent excursion, I couldn&#x27;t stay the entire camp, so they asked me to run some sessions with local teachers instead, since I had so much experience volunteering to teach their kids.  I prepared some lessons and explained to the teachers that I was not a professional teacher like they were, and that my teaching wisdom and experience only consisted of basic theory and volunteer experience.  I made it clear that I was not qualified to teach them about teaching.  Instead, I focused on professional skills that I brought over from the corporate world.  We had sessions on conflict resolution and negotiation tactics using concepts developed by Max Bazerman at Harvard, the Behavioral Change Stairway Model at the FBI, and discussions about conflicting cultural worldviews and personalities, the basics of which are taught in many corporate seminars.  I also focused on leadership styles, motivation tactics, and decision-making strategies.  My sessions were very well-received and I received lots of thanks from the teachers, as well as a round of applause at the end of my time there.<p>This organization never asked me to do anything like surgery, building repair, etc.  They did ask me to help out with some computer stuff now and then.  For their medicine, agriculture, and construction programs, they made sure to bring in only qualified people.  Full stop.  The organization had a relationship with the local government and had gained respect of the local government because they did things properly.  That&#x27;s the way it should be.  When you&#x27;re a non-profit, don&#x27;t do anything that will waste the scarce dollars you have been given.<p>Secondly, it&#x27;s true that your impact in these countries is small.  But it&#x27;s like the story of the kid who saved the one starfish.  The man comes along and asks the boy why he saved that starfish, what difference does it make in the face of so many starfish dying on the beach?  The boy thinks and says, &quot;Well, it made a difference for that one.&quot;  I still keep in touch with the kids I&#x27;ve taught.  The Internet is wonderful today and makes this easier than ever, except in those locations where the situation is so dire that you take Bill Gates&#x27;s attitude of choosing to fight the malaria over getting the Internet up and running.  Overall, I know that the kids are impacted on an individual basis because they keep in touch with me, still call me Teacher, and talk with me about things.  The people in these communities appreciate that someone took their time and money to go and help them, if what was provided was helpful.  Again, that goes back to the organization making sure that the money and effort is being spent in a way that maximizes ROI.  It&#x27;s the same in business.  You don&#x27;t tell a recruiter to do the bookkeeping, you get a bookkeeper or accountant for that.  It just makes sense.<p>Thirdly, these trips have value in that they work as vision trips.  A percentage of volunteers will go on these trips and have their eyes open and their thinking changed in such a way that their life goals change.  Those people are the ones who will go into this work full-time and throw away the nice cushy jobs in the first world.  Those people are also often the ones who can afford to do it because they&#x27;ve been working nice cushy jobs in the first world for a while, so they have the savings to make it happen for some time until outside donations can take over in terms of funding everything.  If these trips don&#x27;t happen, a huge recruiting channel for these organizations for long-term workers completely disappears.  These organizations prefer that these trips be available for people from every generation because you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;ll find the people who will have the switch turned on inside themselves, and you don&#x27;t know which people will have which kinds of support networks that would be willing to help fund this lifestyle.  This third factor is possibly the most important reason why these trips are a good thing.<p>The goal to have a locally-run operation staffed by locals is an important one.  But it takes time to get there, and these trips are a part of the process to get there.<p>edit:  clarification",1393393787

Local Garfield administration and politics seem to have been. The principal under which Escalante&#x27;s program flourished (Henry Gradillas) was a big contributor to the success, but even so, he wasn&#x27;t invited back after a sabbatical, and it&#x27;s reasonable to speculate that he&#x27;d run afoul of the community which employed him when he&#x27;d prioritized academics over athletics. Later principals weren&#x27;t anywhere near as supportive.<p>There was also the professional jealousy that came with Escalante&#x27;s hollywood fame. You can argue that&#x27;s petty, but I hope anyone who&#x27;d do so from the software world is equally circumspect about any kind of professional jealousy when it comes to the success of approaches you don&#x27;t subscribe to in the software world.<p>So, yeah.

On my Sandy Bridge processor, I found that although GCC was the slowest, the assembly was still the clear winner:<p><pre><code>  gcc 4.8.0: 0.801596113 seconds\n  icc 14.0.1: 0.739297534 seconds\n  clang 3.2: 0.706446818 seconds\n  assembly: 0.104038212 seconds\n</code></pre>\nI was surprised by Clang here.  It&#x27;s an older version than the other two, yet fastest.  A quick glance at &#x27;perf stat&#x27; (which I used for the timing) says that although it&#x27;s executing fewer instructions per cycle, it&#x27;s managing to use fewer instructions than the other two.<p>Although it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference here, those are odd flags for Sandy Bridge.  Core2 is a previous generation, and it supports AVX which came out after SSE4.2.  \nIf you did to specify SB, you&#x27;d want the unwieldy &quot;-march=corei7-avx&quot;.

One of the big things about American culture I now regard as totally odious is the idea that everyone wants to be like us and therefore if we remake the world in our image we are doing everyone a favor.  Most of the world doesn&#x27;t want to be exactly like us -- they like some things about us and dislike other things, and what we like about ourselves may not bear any relation to that.<p>Societies are homeostatic, equilibrium-seeking systems.  If they weren&#x27;t they&#x27;d fall apart under the sorts of stresses that life places on us wherever we live.  Foreigners coming in to believe they are making a difference inevitably solve the wrong problems and likely solve them badly.<p>Now, my parents took some boarding school students to help build medical clinics (under the direction of &quot;Where there Is No Doctor&quot; author David Werner) in the mountains of Mexico back before I was born.  They were providing unskilled labor in an area that really did have a shortage (because most people were working in the farms).  The upshot though wasn&#x27;t that the clinics got built faster (they might not have) but that my father got interested in medicine and changed careers from being a math teacher to being a doctor.  I have never heard my parents talk about what a difference the students made, or even so much about whatever difference they made.<p>But having talked with David about this he told me about some of his failures, about how they had this big anti-folk-medicine campaign that they hoped would reduce infant mortality due to diarrhea but then when the floods came, people wouldn&#x27;t use their folk medicine anymore and the mortality rates went up instead of down and he said they had to go back and reposition what they were offering as one remedy among many.<p>Often we forget that the people closest to a problem are the best prepared to solve it, and we forget to trust them on this.   It is far too often the case that the do-gooders and the activists who haven&#x27;t yet learned this lesson, solve the wrong problems, often badly, and make things worse.",1393393220

And a site dedicated to the computer game, with a Perl forum a cobbled and altered &quot;Matt&#x27;s WWW Scripts&quot; beauty :) Next, around 99, I discovered PHP (when it was still v3) and built what later peopled termed a blog and CMS. I used it to build another gaming site and a fan site for a radio show that became the &quot;official&quot; site for the program. Later I built upon that custom PHP CMS to make a local news site that got heavy traffic for that age (early 2000s) but later sold my interest in the site (and it went defunct not even a year later).<p>On my original PHP CMS, I recall first using CSS book by Håkon Wium Lie & Bert Bos, original CSS developers, published back in 97 or 98, to try to go it full CSS back in 2000. It sort of worked, but was brittle. This was a few years before the CSS Zen Garden and advancing browsers quickly dispensed with the old tarted up &quot;table&quot; HTML.<p>But again, for all the great technological strides made, I miss that age -- it seemed we are all &quot;swimming in one pool&quot; -- and all doing our own thing, building and taming unchartered wilderness. Now, building a website for a &quot;clever idea&quot; seems pointless as everyone&#x27;s online attention is on Facebook or Twitter or Pinterest. Even Wordpress blogs seem to be getting passe.

There are countless 80 or 90% complete Vim modes in various modern editors. But the absence of a truly native feeling Vim (that last 10%) is a deal breaker for many. I&#x27;d rather see more editor developers spend time finding a solution that provides a <i>truly</i> authentic Vim mode instead of spending countless hours merely approaching 90% compatibility. For the people who you&#x27;re selling on that Vim mode (the people who would care that your editor provides it) 90% isn&#x27;t good enough. There are other ways to integrate Vim modes in your editor such as using the (inappropriately named) &quot;Netbeans interface&quot; which actually allows Vim to run in the background while you integrate your UI on top of it across a serializable bridge.

Gox is most likely in Japan in the first place because of the insane state regulatory structure in the U.S. So our state MTLs push entrepreneurs out, leave consumers high and dry, and make crashes of the sort we&#x27;re witnessing now more likely. We need a federal regulatory regime; it&#x27;s a shame that the other entrepreneurs and investors affected--including the ones who run this site--are too cowardly to come out and say it publicly as I have.

And if you&#x27;re just generating a key, why not read it directly from random instead?<p>You can pretend that urandom gives good randomness and be surprised when you get key collisions. Just like you can pretend that strncpy null-terminates strings and be surprised when you get a buffer overflow vulnerability. That makes you a menace.<p>For what&#x27;s it&#x27;s worth, I agree that an adequately seeded CSPRNG should never &#x27;run out&#x27; of entropy, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind if Linux got a BSD-style shared random/urandom.\nBut as it stands, urandom is not guaranteed to be adequately seeded, and I have no idea why you would advocate taking that risk.",1393391550

Maybe even with all the seeming waste and incompetence, it keeps people engaged.

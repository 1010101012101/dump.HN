A war for a sufficiently advanced country such as US just means some place thousands miles away getting bombed, and a small percentage (compared to the enemy) of <i>professional</i> soldiers getting hurt. In other words, they have no f/n concept of what war actually entails and the toils of a country at war.<p>Well, the budget might be hurt a little, but that's it.

Since ""imp.q"" is not a function call, it is a reference to a function, you are simply passing in a function.  Since javascript ""classes"" are just objects with function references, you can't somehow decide what object ""this"" should point at unless it is explicit.  In the case of ""foo.bar()"", it is explicitly ""foo"".  In the case of setTimeout( foo.bar, 100), all setTimeout gets is a function pointer with no notion of what this should be.<p>Anyway, the rest of your gripes just sound like you don't like untyped languages, which is personal preference and I guess I don't share your preference.",1329112707

I.e not pro-Iraq per se, but pro-military in general. Those kinds of images are used all the time, especially in countries heading or involved in wars. Also the ""soldiers doing cool things"", ""soldier playing guitar back in the camp and longing for home"", ""soldiers having some innocent fun between attacks"", and the ""soldier is a regular guy from some place back home"", etc. They are used in order to make the military personnel look humanize, and in effect humanize the war effort.<p>(Of course, that's not to say that soldiers aren't human: just that this has nothing to do with them being soldiers.

Yes, lessons can be learned by failure, and test pivoting early is good if needed, but if you're failing this often, and (disturbingly) for the same reasons then there surely must be a time to step back and take some time to do things differently.<p>The disagreements with founders being repeated so often is a sign of something. I realize that it may indeed be ""the other guy"" in all cases, but sooner or later folk will stay wondering if it's you. At best, your ability to select partners comes into question.<p>There must also be a balance between this frantic skipping from one project to another (6 months per project?) and putting in the time to get a product done right. It _feels_ like you're looking for an overnight smash hit, or you bail quickly. The conference project felt especially like this. You narrowed the market to a tiny segment, the segment incidentally that had the least motivation to pay anything, then opted not to follow through on the markets that are more likely to pay. It's like you built a job site, focused on people who already had high paying gigs, rather than people out of work desperate for jobs, or employers disparate for employees.<p>I think the article was really interesting, and I think an excellent learning experience for others - thank you for being honest enough to post it. I think you have learnt some lessons along the way, and hopefully these comments will make the xperience more valuable to you.

3584381,comment,3583709,3583806,2,0,mattgreenrocks,,,"> The interesting part is that it's not always clear to me why this exploitation is done<p>My cynical guess is that there is significant money to be made in pushing girls towards early sexualization. The idea is to get them worrying about sexuality, and all of the things they think they need to do in order to be considered sexually attractive. This would include things like hair products, lipstick, and clothing. By creating this association between the mere ideas of ""sexy"" and ""what everyone's already doing,"" they can instill a deep sense of status anxiety at an early age. This anxiety is not only easy to create (as the age group is highly hormonal), it feeds off of existing social hierarchies that are emerging. And, I believe, the advertiser hopes it is the beginning of a lifelong addiction to buying things in order to feel worthwhile.<p>I hope you don't take this to be hyperbole; I'm actually surprised it came out as dark as it did. But, now that I think of it, it is violence against the soul, and thus, evil.",1329112169

In all my dealings with VC-types, they've tended to be pretty cavalier when it comes to advising founders how to treat users' private data, maybe because they themselves aren't really on the firing line. Hockey-stick growth is more important to them; if the money comes, the fines will be paid and all will be well. This is business. Sony's still making money, after all. And Facebook, look at Facebook! Just look at that S-1 glow! I'm blinded, that's for sure.<p>But founders and fellow entrepreneurs, we need to hash this out internally (pardon the pun): Sure, harvesting address books can gain you explosive growth, but at what eventual cost? Can you really sleep at night? George opted in to address book sharing to find his friends in your shiny new app, but he didn't really think that his CEO would get a push notification saying ""'GeorgeTheFurryStud' would like to talk to you!"" when his CEO eventually signed up. Even if you're using SSL, even if you're hashing addresses (which isn't a cure-all, being able to intuit connections divulges <i>a lot</i> of info), are your servers really that secure? And what if you're not Facebook? It's highly unlikely that you're even in the league (no offense, none of us are).<p>Either way, politics is afoot here. Would advise other founders and developers to do what they believe is right & lawful, and not bow to pressure or any of this ""no one cares about privacy"" stuff, 'cause while the money guys and gals may lose a little investment, we're ultimately responsible for our companies' actions.

Then in the twentieth century alone we start with WWI and WWII (the German military did not view the war against the Soviet Union as winnable), and end up with a great number of proxy wars in the mid-East and Asia.<p>The trade argument is strange considering that the world economy was more tightly integrated in 1914 than it is today. It is probably correct that nuclear weapons exert something of a stabilizing force, although it is disconcerting that the nash equilibrium for games of mutual-assured destruction requires random detonation by both parties in order to demonstrate irrationality and establish deterrence.",1329110612

9521781,comment,9521151,9521231,0,0,bitwize,,,"> Now, with windows 10, my security updates will come bundled with my unwanted OS changes.<p>Had this experience with Mac OS X. For 10.4 they switched to a new, dynamically linked libstdc++ that used the new Itanium C++ ABI. 10.3 had a statically linked libstdc++ and the old ABI.<p>They pushed out an OS update that installed the new libstdc++ on 10.3, breaking linking against libstdc++ with standard cxxflags. You see they had integrated cross-compilation for 10.3 into the new Xcode on 10.4, and didn&#x27;t give a shit about people who were still compiling stuff on 10.3.<p>I decided after that that if Apple was going to break working compilation on my OS because I hadn&#x27;t upgraded to the newest and shiniest, then they didn&#x27;t really want my money. They seem to be doing OK without it, and I&#x27;m doing fine without them.<p>If Microsoft pulls this sort of stunt with Windows, then fuck everything about this change. They&#x27;re such sticklers in the opposite direction, doing so much to ensure backward-compatible everything that the house of cards sometimes comes crashing down, that I don&#x27;t think <i>that</i> will be a problem with Windows 10+x.",1431298759

9521776,comment,9520145,9521626,0,0,reuven,,,"You might very well be right. It might be a fundamental flaw of Git that in order to use it, you have to understand its innards.  Certainly, in order to use it effectively, and in order to avoid disaster, you need to now how it&#x27;s storing data.<p>I&#x27;ve never used it, but I&#x27;ve heard that Mercurial offers most of the power of Git, with much less of the pain, and an easier user interface.  I&#x27;m willing to believe that this is true.  I&#x27;ll even believe (whether it&#x27;s true or not) that Mercurial does provide a nice abstraction layer, one that allows you to ignore the underlying implementation.<p>The thing is, that doesn&#x27;t matter at this point.  Many people (including me) have gotten through the Git learning curve and now find it to be fantastically useful.  I&#x27;m far more productive with Git than I was with SVN or CVS, and I&#x27;m not the only one to feel this way.   As a result, you now have an ecosystem of tools, tutorials, books, etc. that all build on Git -- not to mention companies such as GitHub and GitLab that supply (relatively) easy-to-use tools and interfaces.<p>Also: A large part of Git&#x27;s power stems from the fact that you&#x27;re always thinking in terms of commits, and where those commits fit on your repository&#x27;s graph.  I&#x27;m not sure how you can abstract away from that, even if it&#x27;s an interesting idea in theory.<p>A combination of critical mass (among open-source developers and a growing number of corporations), an ecosystem, and a powerful (if hard to understand) data model has made Git the standard nowadays.  It&#x27;s a crying shame that Git is so hard for so many people to get... but I&#x27;ve found that in my own work, the learning curve was more than worthwhile, and has made me more productive.",1431298682

The first is that value questions are objective, and moral anti-realism is completely unjustified.<p>This is probably the longest-running debate in human history, and he dismisses it completely with a link to his undergraduate paper on the subject.<p>Putting that aside, the problem with this argument is it doesn&#x27;t allow for changing beliefs.  If we are only driven by fitting in with our group, then no political views would ever change as they wouldn&#x27;t ever reach critical mass.<p>Just look at the changing opinions of gay marriage.  Political views absolutely do change over time, and they can change very quickly.

9521756,comment,9521015,9521614,0,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"Suppose 100% of the responsibility is borne by manufacturers. How is this different from adaptive cruise control or ABS today? For one, the liability cross-section increases dramatically. In 2013, the U.S. auto insurance industry incurred $125 billion in damages [1]. With human error eliminated, this number will shrink. But it will also shift to manufacturers&#x27; balance sheets.<p>What about insurance? Insurance works with un-correlated risks. You mowing down a pedestrian doesn&#x27;t cause everyone around you to do the same. This keeps insurance companies&#x27; instantaneous expected losses manageable. Coding errors and recalls are not un-correlated. If your car has an error, so does–likely–every other car in its run. This concentrates losses and makes them difficult to insure.<p>There are solutions.

Almost everyone I know just sticks with the version of Windows that came with the computer, and when they switch to a newer version it&#x27;s because they bought a new computer that comes with it preinstalled.<p>The probable advantage to Microsoft is that they have a less disjointed platform to support.  For example apps released for the app store don&#x27;t run on Windows 7 and earlier, and apps that work on Windows 7 and earlier can&#x27;t be put on the app store.  That sort of thing has been an enormous success killer for some of Microsoft&#x27;s newer business initiatives, and that in turn means it&#x27;s a threat to the long-term success of the company.<p>It might also save on development costs.  3-year release cycles mean you&#x27;re at great risk of sinking tons and tons of resources into gold plating ideas that ultimately bomb on the market.

But the whole point of this exercise is to make an approximation for the log function over its whole domain. If you take Mathematica&#x27;s/your polynomial and do that with it, you get an infinitely large relative error at 1 because log(1)=0 but your approx_log(1) is not 0.<p>(This is the <i>central point</i> I was trying to make in my comment, and the fact that you missed it suggests I wasn&#x27;t clear enough. I&#x27;m sorry about that; in particular, clearly I should have made it more explicit that I understand how argument reduction works -- it hadn&#x27;t occurred to me that that was in question, since it&#x27;s a standard technique, described perfectly adequately in the article we&#x27;re discussing.)<p>> if you use the polynomial outside of that range<p>I never for an instant suggested using the polynomial outside that range. I am assuming the obvious argument-reduction scheme where you say log2(2^a.b) = a + log2(b) and arrange for b to lie within some interval [t,2t). In other words, I am assuming the same thing that Goldberg described and the same thing that you are assuming (but apparently missing a key consequence of).<p>So. Suppose you compute log2(1) using your polynomial. You argument-reduce: log2(1) = 2 + log2(0.25). Then you use your polynomial: log2(1) = 2 + (-3.64631 + 7.9376/4 - 5.30406/16) ~= 0.0066. The actual value you are looking for is log2(1) = 0. Your relative error is infinite.<p>(You can use the other end of the interval instead. Then you get -0.0035; again, the relative error is infinite.)<p>Goldberg avoids having this happen by forcing the absolute error to be zero at the endpoints (when he uses a polynomial on [1,2)) or at the relevant point in the middle (when he uses one on [0.75,1.5)). This extra constraint is what forces him to accept larger relative errors <i>on his [t,2t) interval</i>; that&#x27;s the price he has to pay for finite relative error <i>on the whole domain of the log2 function</i>.<p>> and this has nothing to do with the behaviour of approximation polynomial at the edges<p>Indeed, the fact that the point where you run into trouble is at the end of the interval is irrelevant, and it would be an interior point that mattered if you did as Goldberg did and used an interval like [0.75,1.5).<p>> So, in short, I <i>am</i> solving the right problem.<p>No, really, you&#x27;re not. Goldberg wants his relative error for the approx log2 function not to blow up when computing log2(1), which requires that it evaluate to exactly 0 when fed exactly 1. Your polynomial doesn&#x27;t have that property.<p>(Of course it&#x27;s questionable whether relative error is what one ought to care about for an approximate logarithm function. Maybe it isn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know what applications Goldberg actually has in mind, and quite possibly he isn&#x27;t at liberty to tell us. But the problem he&#x27;s stated is to compute an approximation to log2 with reasonable relative error, and it&#x27;s simply incorrect to say he&#x27;s done that badly because you can get reasonable relative error on a smaller interval, if your relative error goes to infinity elsewhere. Which it does.)<p>> the derivative is very bumpy and discontinuous<p>Yeah, I dislike that too. Again, how much this matters depends on the applications you have in mind.<p>> My pointing out a bad mathematical practice wasn&#x27;t personal, so please don&#x27;t steer the discussion into that direction. [...] accepting a scientific result (partly-)based on credentials is considered to be toxic in science.<p>I never said anything even slightly personal; I have made no comment on either Goldberg&#x27;s credentials or yours (or for that matter mine); only one person in this discussion has appealed to credentials, and it&#x27;s you. Twice. (Once earlier: &quot;Unless you are an expert in numerical methods ...&quot;. Once just now, comparing your credentials with Goldberg&#x27;s.)<p>Anyway: of course I strongly agree: credentials are less important than results. In this case, Goldberg made an approximation to log2 whose relative error is bounded on its entire domain of applicability, and you didn&#x27;t. In particular, #4 from your summary is flatly incorrect.",1431295943

9521537,comment,9521015,9521387,0,0,iiiggglll,,,"This was actually a plot point in a little-known B-grade sci-fi movie called &quot;Solar Crisis&quot;. There were stretches of highway far from cities with very little traffic aside from the occasional robotic cargo truck, which were implied to have been programmed to stop if any living thing were encountered blocking the road. Gangs of robbers would steal cargo from trucks in isolated areas by tying a cow to a stake in the middle of the road, causing the robotic truck would come to a stop in front of the cow while playing a recorded voice that shouted to &quot;clear the highway&quot;. There is a scene where some characters are riding in the back of one of these automated cargo trucks and then have to escape some of these robbers.<p>The implication is that if some of our roads gradually become devoid of humans, robbing automated vehicles will become a &quot;thing&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t actually sound that far fetched, really. It would presumably be safer for the crooks than robbing a real truck today for three reasons: 1) they wouldn&#x27;t have to threaten a human (thus lowering the stakes if they get caught), 2) the trucks likely would not be built to shoot back (think of the potential liability for the trucking company if it were), 3) the trucking companies would likely not put much energy into pursuing the criminals, so long as the losses were small in the grand scheme of things.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the notion of people shooting down delivery drones and stealing the packages. People will do it, and it will likely be tolerated to some small degree. Even today we already have people stealing packages off doorsteps, although there is occasionally vigilante justice in those cases:<p><a href=""http://noevalleysf.blogspot.com/2012/11/crime-beat-suspected-package-thief.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://noevalleysf.blogspot.com/2012/11/crime-beat-suspected...</a>",1431295299

Aside from the awful metro garbage thrown on top of the OS (which can be removed / turned off) It was quite unstable, all my games would randomly crash, even <i>the mouse</i> exhibited weird behaviour and bugs. I went back to 7, everything is fine now. I get the impression windows 10 will be more of the same, this is just pushing me more and more towards using linux all the time, now that linux gaming is becoming more and more viable also.\nAlso MS are starting to act like apple, intentionally crippling their software. For example to develop windows store apps, you <i>need</i> windows 8 or higher, you cant just download the sdk for windows 7 even though it has the same kernel as 8 and is essentially the same OS. Also the development process for windows store is horrible and unnecessarily complicated (compared to say android development which is very developer friendly). Also in order to force people to move to windows 8 MS have made some optimisations to directx that they have <i>not</i> released for 7 even though once again there is absolutely nothing preventing it except for their attempt to manipulate their users.",1431295282

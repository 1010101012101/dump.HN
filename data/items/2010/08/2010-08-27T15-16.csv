Sadly, that option disappeared in Leopard.

However, the most recent Y Combinator exit (and perhaps the largest?) was a group that broke most of the advice given. Does this discredit the advice? Is it the exception that proves the rule?<p>Specifically, here are some of the disparities between 280N and the common advice:<p>2 founders. 
1 is too little, 3 is a bit too much and 4 is out of the question (except for Reddit?). 2 is just right. 280N is yet another example of a more-than-2-founder company that succeeded.<p>Business / Technical co-founders. 
Ross, Tom and Francisco are all wonderful programmers. They all have a degree relating to computer science. Each one contributed significantly to the products that they delivered. None of them are business oriented (though I'm sure that had some business skills and/or picked them up along the way).<p>Products. 
280North didn't create a product and start selling it. They released it for free. Then open sourced the framework they used to build it. They then created a community around that framework. And, finally, they started work on a development tool for the framework and community.<p>And other interesting notes:<p>Funding.
In order to do this, they took surprisingly little funding.<p>Engaging the community.
They took time to engage the community (their customers?) when they could have been coding new features. Of course, this is advice given by several successful entrepreneurs. They also attended and spoke at conferences.<p>So, HN, what's up? Is the mold bunk? Are 280N just a special case because they were building a framework and community?

1639121,comment,1639043,1639043,0,0,pedoh,,,"Suppose you rent a server at a hosting facility. This server could be a physical server or a VPS. It could be a piece of ""cloud"" infrastructure (a good list can be found at <a href=""https://www.cloudkick.com/providers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cloudkick.com/providers/</a>).<p>Some people who have little technical operations experience will write their code and copy it over to their production server to deploy it. As time goes on, the server needs to be changed; perhaps you need to add a library to extend the function of PHP. More time goes on, and then all of a sudden you need to build out a second web server, identical to the first. How do you do it? The first web server has been hacked and modified, and it's not necessarily trivial to build out a new one.<p>Opscode uses Chef to create ""recipes"" that determine everything you want on a box. So instead of logging into the first web server and hacking on it to get it in your desired state, you modify your recipes to add your PHP module there. Then, when you need to build out more boxes identical to the first, you run your Chef recipe and away you go.<p>What I'm not sure about with Opscode is how they do Configuration Management. If I have three applications on the box, and each of them have independent configuration, does Opscode manage that versioning for me, so that I really can take a new server from nothing and have it up and running with identical versions of my code and identical versions of my configuration files, substituting values in where appropriate? You might want every web server to be identical <i>except</i> for X, Y, Z (maybe you route one web server to one MySQL slave and one web server to a second MySQL slave, for example). I'm not sure what Opscode is doing to make that simple.<p>I've built out a web interface and underlying architecture for the company I work for to do exactly this sort of thing (and a whole lot more) via Puppet (<a href=""http://puppetlabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://puppetlabs.com</a>). My interface handles rolling upgrades to eliminate downtime and a whole host of other slick things. Our developers do <i>not</i> hand over code to a deployment team; they do their own deployments.

It's not R&D vs Operations, they're on the same team!

Feeling of contribution of their work to society is a plus for many people. If developers are shameful of their work or do not want it publicized, however, it could decrease morale.<p>+ Possible increase in amount of eyes on code and users of product, which may increase the need for code changes that could increase the quality of the product. The predicted quality increase is still often overestimated.<p>Cons:<p>- Most projects with any respectable amount of use in-the-wild (many are not used, and it is not a problem) require a level of support which might not have been necessary had they not been open-sourced. And the amount of time required for support and related added functionality is often underestimated.<p>- Despite best efforts, projects will inadvertently leak private company data. Usually the risk associated with data going public is small, but web searches can often find passwords, etc. Many things can mitigate this risk (thoughtful design and practices, a more secure network, etc.), but it is a risk.<p>Tips:<p>* The more time spent on fewer projects, the more successful they will be, and the more this will reflect positively on the company.<p>* You need a good balance where there are enough leads on the project to sustain some leaving, but too much complexity will kill a project.<p>* Company and organizational/cultural politics can severely weaken a project. This is probably just as valid of a reason that many large academic projects stink as the reason that they are not money-driven or having to deal with competition.<p>* Lawyers and legal/licensing concerns can kill or severely stagnate an OSS project.<p>Despite all that, I still think companies should do as much OSS work as possible, even if it isn't <i>always</i> good for business.",1282923578

I'm oversimplifying of course but it seems that some people really enjoy making things in new, clever ways. They like new programming languages, they like doing stuff in far fewer lines of code than it would normally take, they love clever techniques, new algorithms and so on. In contrast, the careful people just really want to make sure it works and don't really care as much about using some neat trick.<p>I think all good programmers have aspects of both. I think I tend to skew more toward the clever side but I think I have a healthy dose of careful. Another programmer I know is super paranoid about bugs and is much more focused on being careful. Perhaps that is because she spent a lot more time in a real software company which ships code to big customers where as I spend a lot more time on research style projects.<p>So I think I have a relatively good sense of how to find the clever programmers. But my company is currently searching for someone more on the careful end. How does one find the careful programmers?

1639048,comment,1638868,1638868,0,0,sofuture,,,"I've recently jumped into Erlang, and have come to some of the same conclusions. I read Armstrong's Erlang book, and thought 'that seems cool' and didn't at all grok what was going on beyond the superficial. Then a few months later, just sat down and started solving Project Euler problems. At first it was strange and foreign and I was mad variables were immutable. A day later and it just clicked, I'd never had that much fun writing code.<p>The FP paradigm is (to me, even after 15 years of imperative programming) so much more natural for development, since you're able to sanely start attacking the problem directly -- instead of architecting a big-picture solution up front that's probably wrong anyway because you've ignored some detail you haven't yet discovered.<p>Building things with actions instead of objects just makes much more sense. Reuse comes much more naturally, and doesn't seem as contrived as a lot of OOP reuse seems. I've noticed that working my FP muscles out has made me a much better imperative programmer -- I write a lot more clever and effective code (not clever like 'tee-hee-no-one-will-ever-figure-this-out'!).",1282922465

But I really don't know how one could affirm that education do not ""pay"".<p>Heavy focus on deep, large, long and high-quality education to their offspring is the most important reason, if not the only one, for elite people to stay in the elite. It is also the most rational explanation to why some people are often perceived as more successful than other, eg Chinese and Jewish.<p>It is easy to come up with counter examples of some guy who did not have the best traditional education cursus and did manage to be successful despite this. But exceptions are not the rule. The mainstream, average rule is that people in power have had good or excellent education.<p>So this little chart about ""education pays"" is just a confirmation, among others, to a well-known fact. It has a lot of shortcomings, and shortcuts (like using the income as a measure for success) but it is some value, at least as a reminder.<p>NB: I may seem hot on the topic. Yes, I am hot on this.

Yet it's what the function is set up for; you can't even see a person's questions and answers, which have frequently (to me) proved far more revealing than the profile.<p>* Again, if you're doing it properly, rating someone highly sends them a mail saying 'someone's interested in you'. Which always looks to me like saying 'Someone's interested in you but doesn't have the guts / energy / enthusiasm to write you a proper message so has gone for the easy way'. Not a great intro.<p>With a bit of tweaking I agree it could give some useful seed data, but not much more; fundamentally I think the question-based approach is very good, but I think their scoring algorithm could benefit from refinement.",1322129696

4763360,comment,4762336,4762686,2,0,mistercow,,,">Talk about your sexist, racist , ageist comments!<p>That really depends on the definitions of those terms. In a pedantic ""by the dictionary"" sense, yes, those comments are racist, sexist and ageist. But not in a way that can be meaningfully compared to the usual referents of those terms.<p>You see, these concepts are tied up with the idea of privilege[1]. ""Old white guys in the GOP"" draws a boundary around a cluster of one of the most privileged groups in the entire world. There are important practical differences between prejudiced and generalized language directed at oppressed groups, and prejudiced and generalized language directed at a group in power.<p>When we hear someone say ""old white guys are the problem with the GOP"", we know that we're not talking about the unprivileged outliers in that group. We are talking specifically about one of the most privileged groups in America, and crucially, the problem we are talking about is <i>directly tied</i> to their privilege. The implied claim is not that they're sucking up public resources, or ""taking our jobs"", etc. It's that they have <i>power</i> and that their privilege prevents them from understanding many of the issues that are important to unprivileged groups like women and minorities. In short, the problem that ""old white guys"" are accused of causing is something that they have the ability to change.<p>Now don't get me wrong: this kind of prejudice is not <i>harmless</i>. It still attaches a stigma to those who fall within the extension of the term, but not the intension. But the harm it does cannot be seriously compared to the harm done by prejudice against unprivileged groups.<p>>Substituting the words ""Democratic"" and ""young"" and ""of color"" sounds pretty silly.<p>And now we can see what the difference is. ""Young black men"" draws a boundary around a cluster of one of the <i>least</i> privileged groups in America. Even though you only substituted apparently parallel terms in the sentence, the meaning of the sentence is drastically different. Once you take into consideration the societal context, you can see that ""the problem with the Democrats is young black guys"" <i>isn't</i> the other side of the coin. The ""old white guys"" statement is about a group wielding power while blinded by privilege. The ""young black guys"" statement is about... what? It can't be about power and privilege because power and privilege are <i>outlier properties</i> in that group. So whatever problem is, it's probably not something that the people in question have much control over.<p>And that is a <i>huge</i> difference.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(social_inequality)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(social_inequality)</a>",1352476769

I think everyone here can figure out why the methodology and sampling size would lead to inaccurate results...and at the same time, I think everyone would also agree that this sampling would vastly undercount the actual amount of racism among our citizenry (as frequent Twitter users have a much different demographic than the voting demographic).<p>Is there a way to see what actual tweets were classified as racist? Or is it just ones that used words commonly accepted to be hate speech?

4763344,comment,4759510,4759510,1,0,dkoehler,,,"I've seen quite a lot of debate with hard lines of what defines ""good"" code. In my admittedly limited experience, I've found that the definition of ""good"" varies with the situation in which the code is written. ""Good"" in my opinion is not something that has a concrete definition. It's entirely dependent on the requirements of the project, and how the developer meets them.<p>-Sometimes this means a programmer can drop into the style already in use on a project, even if it's not the 'best' approach. That way his changes are low-impact and can be easily understood by the people who have worked in the system for years.<p>-Sometimes this means the programmer needs to architect a complex solution to a hard problem. (Though I think this is an assumption we make far too frequently.)<p>-Sometimes this means the programmer should spend some time understanding the constraints on the project, and express them in code. If a constraint is acceptable at least until the next major version of a piece of software, then why not focus on making it simple to alter the assumption, rather than adding complexity to avoid the assumption completely?<p>-And sometimes, this really does just mean ""Ship that mess by next Friday"", regardless of the cost. Sometimes it's just more important to get a poorly architected version in the hands of users that just does what it says on the tin, especially if their input could drastically change your requirements.",1352476628

The local paper, Palm Beach Post, just gave him a full-page article in both their online and print editions [http://goo.gl/jhvJf].<p>You, the HN community, also introduced me to Khan Academy many years ago.

A bankrupt person, if anything, is in greatest need of a trustworthy car, and is also the most likely to require a loan to do so.<p>There's also the notion of rent - people who've always had good credit don't really know <i>how</i> different renting is like for people who have bad credit. I came to this country a few years ago with <i>zero</i> US credit rating, and even with a high salary, offer letters, etc, had one hell of a time finding a place to live. Many landlords simply will not consider you, while others charge exorbitant deposits to cover the risk.<p>The recently bankrupt are also the least able to afford a security deposit several times higher than what everyone else pays.<p>The reality of credit in the US is that your life gets exponentially harder as your credit worsens, and the difficulty in turning that ship around increases dramatically. People who've never had to suffer from bad/no credit really need to examine this before clucking judgmentally.",1352473800

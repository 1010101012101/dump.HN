Main allegation here is that foreign espionage has been facilitated (which is illegal) and that knowingly is nothing done against it (that&#x27;s also illegal under the term &quot;Strafvereitelung&quot;). This is definitely somewhat different from surveillance allegations which indeed are more politically inclined and can be argued under antiterror investigations. If state authorities would knowingly support industrial espionage they can get a hard time if it is possible to collect hard evidence for it (I doubt that).",1391439594

7170898,comment,7168865,7169221,2,0,zigger,,,"I attended one of these bootcamps with zero coding skills (I waitressed & had two jobs before I attended) and had major difficulty finding a job as I learned a ton of incorrect information.<p>It took me almost a year, until I found an unpaid internship, followed by another company who hired me because they found I had potential. I learned way more from working with companies who took more time to help me develop my skills than the main instructor at the school I attended. It was both embarrassing and frustrating to find that I was neglected to the point of learning false methods. Not to mention that the main instructor spouts so many prejudices against software practices/languages (TDD, Ruby, etc.) that it could influence a person against marketable skills that are actually fairly valuable.<p>The thing that&#x27;s made me hirable to companies is my determination to learn, and my ability to learn. Books, projects, internships or positions at companies with CTOs who are willing to take the time to say, &quot;Hey, you don&#x27;t know this. Learn it.&quot; is what will get you far, not a coding Bootcamp, in my opinion.<p>Alternatively, if you want to be making 6 figures, the school&#x27;s networks are amazing and they will definitely hook you up with jobs. I didn&#x27;t get the chance to use the network too much, but I know that others have landed jobs immediately, and with great companies.<p>I would say, if you have a ton of money, want the connections, and you&#x27;re fairly technical already (ie. you know how to do some coding), this is for you. Otherwise you are absolutely capable of learning to code and find a job on your own. There are billions of resources online and at meet-ups that will give you a similar curriculum, basically for free or very little.<p>To answer the &#x27;Why would any one hire you?&quot; -- They won&#x27;t unless they really like you & your potential to grow.",1391439451

And by modules I mean you have major pieces of application code that you don&#x27;t want to load until the user triggers an intent to need that stuff. If you have a single page application and most of your users are just consuming content, why load all the config and editing tool JavaScript? Make modules for pieces of your app, and then if needed load the JavaScript for those things. User clicked edit? Ok now load the JavaScript for that stuff.<p>Browser caching is nice, but if you&#x27;re doing a continuous integration/deployment type, you&#x27;re probably invalidating your cache often. If you use a single build you may be invalidating all of your JavaScript for each tiny deploy even though maybe 1% of your JavaScript changed.

7170844,comment,7170299,7170299,13,0,mjn,,,"A few mild disagreements over interpretation:<p>1. NP-hard problems are not necessarily hard for computers to solve; they are only hard in the <i>worst</i> case, which could be very rare for some NP-hard problems. SAT, for example, is the original canonical NP-complete problem. But in AI, it&#x27;s nowadays seen as almost a canonical &quot;fast bytecode&quot;. Other systems will often want to find a way to reduce their problem to SAT, because that reduction implies tractability, rather than intractability! If you can target SAT in your backend, you can rely on it (probably) being easy to solve, since most instances of SAT can be quickly disposed of by heuristic solvers. (The more common practical problem here is size blow-up in the reduction to SAT, rather than the SAT instance itself being hard to solve.)<p>2. Partly as a result of #1, the relevance of NP-hardness to cryptography in practice is often overstated. NP-hard problems aren&#x27;t really hard in the relevant sense: worst-case harness is not sufficient for a one-way function. Attempts to construct one-way functions out of NP-hard primitives have a pretty poor record (not all have been broken, but a number have, and none have caught on). The other direction is true, though, that P=NP would imply no one-way functions.<p>I wrote a bit more along these lines a while ago: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html</a>",1391438988

And most of the world with money in play is more likely to follow rationality than ideological purity here.<p>But with regard to data quality, OSM is encumbered its own policy. OSM cannot (or refuses to) make use of high-quality bulk data from outside, regardless of how that data was licensed.

They are generally not grounded at all - stuck in their logical mind, avoiding and blocked from emotional feelings; Long-term suppression / repression as a coping mechanism. They feel safe in the logical plain because they can highly understand the functioning of the world, which then can allow for a very good ability at manipulating others - though many humans are good bullshit detectors, so long as their story gets more and more complex. Calling them out on the behaviour, even with the intent of no harm, and explaining to them their behaviour - so they can see it reflected back at them, from my experience, has them moving towards a defensive posture with their guard up. You have to be careful because they are very sensitive, hypersensitive almost, and fragile, and they may direct and project anger towards you as you could be seen as a threat.<p>I can only imagine this kind of behaviour evolves from a deep and intense fear of survival, also associated with reward from positive interactions with others. If people get away with this behaviour when they&#x27;re young and it &quot;is helpful&quot; to them as a coping mechanism, then it&#x27;ll follow them into adulthood. The people who are successful enough at it will be able to gain resources and relationships, at least for long enough to keep perpetuating the behaviours, and they won&#x27;t stay in one area for long - this is the only way they could maintain succeeding with this kind of behaviour.

It&#x27;s just when you combine it with someone who feels they&#x27;re getting away with lying, then they&#x27;ll see how much they can get away with.<p>These people, if they&#x27;re to be behaving this way successfully, are very intelligent - very sensitive people to begin with. I&#x27;ve always thought they&#x27;d be able to be very successful if they were honest and kind in their dealings, however this makes me feel/realize like it really must be something traumatic that occurred for this behaviour to take hold; Fear of survival is a fucker, and I can sympathize with the possibility of this as a coping mechanism. Basically imagine a lost, lonely, terrified child - emotional state/maturity wise - and how that &quot;child&quot; may behave in order to have connection, relation with others.<p>To answer your question finally, business is basically where people can network easily, where people are open to relationship building. It&#x27;s where there are resources available too, and so someone who&#x27;s seeking relationships and has fear of survival - needing to pay for food, shelter, etc - will naturally more likely lead into a business environment.<p>To add as final, I don&#x27;t believe they have the intent to be hurtful or harming - it&#x27;s just what their past hurt that hasn&#x27;t been healed, that&#x27;s directing their logical behaviour; They may not understand this either or fully realize to the degree it&#x27;s influencing them because it will have been deeply repressed emotion. Also, people will be at different levels of awareness and healing - and could be more aware - but still stuck in the behaviours that they know work for them (at least in the short-term), and may just need a situation and role to find where they don&#x27;t need to use these coping mechanisms. Though I can imagine too that&#x27;s a tricky situation too because they won&#x27;t any longer have the incentive to need to change, but just to change enough to find something that causes less threats, e.g. continuously being found out as a liar, betraying people, breaking trust, etc..",1391438338

The NSA would have to start sourcing/generating it&#x27;s own power and water. Anyone who works there will become persona-non-grata. In my opinion, this actually has the chance of doing something. Much better than 500,000 people marching down Broadway, then going home at the end of the day (Iraq war protest, anyone?).<p>And I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to see the NSA go away completely either.

They would even be pleasantly surprised, probably. But that&#x27;s not what we found out. We found out that the NSA and it&#x27;s secret court take the most liberal reading of the laws in place to do whatever they want, and with no good controls over who has access to what information, or when.<p>In short, this is a different form of protest, hopefully a more effective one.",1391437867

For me the transitions weren&#x27;t about being &quot;forced&quot; to do anything but rather a continuing quest to find something that sucks less. I&#x27;ve been on the w3c/mozilla bandwagon since &#x27;98 so I&#x27;ve avoided 90% of the plugin thrashing you mention. The DOM libraries are different interfaces over the same underlying API so they work the same. For the MVC libraries, I&#x27;ve been exploring the space since 2008 (I was writing docs to release my version of the Backbone library when Jeremy released Backbone and his code was better) so I don&#x27;t see it as new and upcoming. Having a build seemed obvious when I started writing 10k+ sloc apps since I&#x27;m not going to put it in one source file and making 30 requests for js is terrible and I had a rake script I copy/pasted around for years before the node build systems showed up. AMD always seemed like a solution in search of a problem to me and I just concatenate everything.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, we&#x27;re about to go through another generational shift in frontend tech. There are a few major developments in the pipeline: ES6 generators and Web Components. Generators allow for different async flow control patterns [1] which greatly changes the feel when writing JS. Component systems (Ember, Angular, Polymer, React) offer significantly improved state control and huge code savings.

Once turned ON, all extensions and plugins including toolbars are blocked. Savvy user can whitelist some extensions etc during setup.

You shouldn&#x27;t be reinventing the wheel with every program you write. But follow this advice too closely and you&#x27;ll end up with a clone. A program with all the good qualities of its predecessor, and all the flaws too.<p>Your clone will be competing with other clones for control of the market. And so long as you&#x27;re competing on the same turf, you&#x27;ll be at a disadvantage. Big established companies rule the market for time tested software. Their program came out before your clone, and they&#x27;ve had lots of time to grow their business. They have a bigger research budget than you, and a bigger marketing department.<p>Besides, everybody already uses their product.

This is especially true in tech, where most projects fail, and for people with wide interests like yourself. Some people would be happy writing nice code and leave it at that. But you&#x27;re going to be bummed if the design is ugly, the marketing plan doesn&#x27;t work, or if any of a dozen other things outside your control goes wrong.  You are upset, anxious, and fearful. You attribute your feelings to objective things around you like business failures, etc. and guess that a new line of work might solve those feelings.<p>Let me suggest that maybe they won&#x27;t. Those feelings are telling you something, but you can&#x27;t trust your guesses about what will solve them, and you especially should not make large, life-changing decisions because of half-understood feelings of anxiety and depression.<p>Instead, try to engage with and resolve those feelings in smaller ways. Pick something small you will decide to do really well and just thoroughly engage in it. Make some new friends. Maybe go talk to a therapist or religious figure.<p>What I found out of this process was that I had made several career moves, some bad choices in my personal life, and a lot of stress by setting myself impossible goals and ignoring some longstanding things I disliked about myself. In the process, I learned that I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to the world around me and especially to close friends and family. After some reading, low-pressure work, and therapy, I understand my own feelings much better, and I derive much more satisfaction from my life outside work.<p>Of course, by no longer putting on my job the stress to define me and my value as a person, I get to approach it much more freely and joyfully. It ain&#x27;t perfect, and it doesn&#x27;t always work, but on a good day I can deal with setbacks and annoyances without them damaging my emotional state.<p>A therapist would call this cognitive therapy focused on mindfulness. Various religions would call it spiritual direction aimed at contemplation or present focus. There does appear to be actual evidence of its value, though I&#x27;m only qualified to say it works anecdotally.

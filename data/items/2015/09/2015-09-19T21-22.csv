Counting the number of violent break-ins is harder than measuring the increase in global temperatures, which is the fair metric to compare against. Instead of just setting up a bunch of thermometers and averaging the results, you have to settle on a definition of violent and comb through police statistics (to get the number of reported break-ins) and surveys (to get the number of unreported break-ins).<p>> <i>I&#x27;m not aware of any politically significant faction on the left claiming that violent crimes are not increasing</i><p>The point of the paper is that when the proposed solution to a reported increase in violent crimes involved a policy liberals would object to, such a faction began to emerge. Whether violent crimes are actually increasing and whether liberals are currently denying said increase are both irrelevant.<p>The actual paper is linked to from the article posted. I only did a cursory read and didn&#x27;t find it to be dripping with bias, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.

And that sucks, because it&#x27;s trivial to make single-threaded code reproducible.<p>But parallel code is how one continues to benefit from Moore&#x27;s law w/r to multiple cores and ever-increasing SIMD width and SIMD units.  And it happened at exactly the same time as the migration to mostly single-threaded weakly-typed languages began.<p>For if your results aren&#x27;t reproducible, there&#x27;s no way to detect if your code has a race condition that is reducing the efficacy of your methods.<p>For an application like molecular dynamics, it&#x27;s important to conserve overall energy.  Any such inconsistency is the equivalent of setting off tiny little hand grenades in the simulation.  Inconsistent summation obscures this without a great deal of work to sample many independent simulations.  Compare and contrast to running things twice to sniff this out in deterministic code.<p>For machine learning, it can amount to anything from a harmless implicit regularizer to the AI equivalent of Gary Busey taking the wheel and driving you straight to crazy town.<p>I speak from experience in both cases.  And speaking from experience, as long as your reductions are associative, you&#x27;ll be fine.  That can be achieved with fixed point atomics, or if you don&#x27;t have them, reduction buffers, or finally, a deterministic reduction algorithm if you have neither.  I&#x27;ve used all of the above and they have at most cost 2-3% more than the non-deterministic alternatives (usually much less).<p>Finally, I inject randomness like crazy, but I do so in a reproducible manner.  Confusing determinism and randomness reminds me of people who don&#x27;t understand the difference between precision and accuracy (TLDR: precision is easy, accuracy is tough).",1442698972

Hoarding U.S. dollars in some account? There is no way to save in current U.S. dollars, ie green pieces of paper, in order to help deal with civilization level catastrophes in the future. You would have to save in terms of real goods. Saving in terms of dollars simply would result in deflation in the near term as you hoard, and inflation in the long-term when you dishoard in order to deal with the catastrophe. When the catastrophe comes, there is no difference between the government dishoarding dollars and the government printing dollars. The government has a printing press, there is no difference between taking the money (metaphorically) out of a hidden vault and between printing new dollars.<p>Now saving now in terms of hoarding real goods, or in building physical infrastructure, could work. But it&#x27;s hard to imagine what kind of real goods would be useful in case of massive catastrophe. Most likely the wrong things would be built or hoarded. We&#x27;re just too far away from the problem, and the government isn&#x27;t good at making those kinds of calculations. Also, it may not be that necessary. People underestimate how much more valuable flows are than stocks. When cities have been destroyed by fire or bombing, they get rebuilt remarkably quickly, as long as the human capital is still there.",1442698316

Students enrolled in Nanodegree Programs have access to coaches, a massive worldwide network of code reviewers, certification, job placement and much, much more.<p>We work hard to help Nanodegree Program students that are looking for jobs in tech get them. For example, one of the best parts of my job is doing mock interviews. Folks on the engineering team volunteer to give a representative tech industry interview to a soon-to-be-graduate and then give them detailed feedback on how they could improve. Hearing back from these students a few weeks later that they got a job at Nest or Google or wherever is one of the most satisfying things I&#x27;ve experienced in my career, and everyone on the team who&#x27;s done it feels the same.<p>Finally, we really do think our graduates are ready for jobs.

Most scientists even ones who code, don&#x27;t even know what bootstrap binaries are.<p>My original point is that the complexity of dealing with differing environments and code versions, combined with the sensitivity of floating point results on the exact source code and environment, practically kills the possibility for exact reproducibility.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m claiming that a better goal is approximate reproducibility.",1442697374

10245540,comment,10244619,10245390,0,0,Mz,,,"Part of the problem is that autism significantly impacts social function. So does prejudice. So the minute you label someone as <i>autistic</i>, it becomes incredibly difficult to say how much of their daily challenge is due to inability to perform socially and how much is due to other people perceiving them differently and treating them differently.<p>The other thing is that many traits seen in autistic individuals and used to label them as defective are also seen in other situations and not viewed as pathology. One example I know of firsthand: The tendency to be very literal is also seen in highly intelligent and highly educated individuals and is a hallmark of good scientific work. But in a person diagnosed with autism, it is pathologized rather than praised as a virtue.<p>It&#x27;s a complicated situation.<p>Edit: I apologize. I am leaving the comment here, but I feel like I replied to the wrong person somehow. Perhaps it should have just been a general comment and not a <i>reply to</i>.

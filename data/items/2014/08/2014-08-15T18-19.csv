If the content of the newspaper was drivel, people would move on. Reporting mattered.<p>Today, media is different, they create brands -- often by capturing uses via portals or other services unrelated to the content. The actual content is a necessary evil. When the brand is global, it doesn&#x27;t matter that the content is garbage, most of the audience is too lazy to change the channel or update their homepage.<p>IMO, the only vital media in America are weekly newspapers.",1408129170

That said, our learned fellow participant impendia here on HN, a professor of mathematics, has strenuously disagreed with me by pointing out the specialized number systems that do treat infinity somewhat like a number. On my part, for the students I encounter, I stick to discussions like &quot;All about Infinity&quot;[1] (formerly titled &quot;Infinity Is Not a Number - It&#x27;s a Free Man&quot;) Katherine Körner, another astute mathematician. I have frequently seen discussions of infinity as a (real) number here on HN that essentially boil down to the error of treating the quotient upon dividing by zero as a real number.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nrich.maths.org/2756"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nrich.maths.org/2756</a>",1408126708

On the other hand I never heard the &quot;too hard to learn&quot; argument: highly regular and small syntax coupled with very interactive experience of ST browsers and other tools made it a joy for me to learn. I have only one complaint: as I learned Pharo I frequently tried to learn some interesting package but I couldn&#x27;t find the &quot;entry point&quot; to it. It took me a long while to realize how to use Pharo&#x27;s FileSystem library, just because it wasn&#x27;t obvious what the external interface is supposed to be.<p>Anyway, Smalltalk still exists and not only as an inspiration for Ruby. Pharo and Squeak are very nice image-based environments, VisualWorks has &quot;enterprise grade&quot; support, GNU Smalltalk is small and lightweight and works well for scripts. There is Amber, which tries to recreate Smalltalk image inside the browser and there&#x27;s (forgot the name) which tries to implement ST on JVM (it was on kickstarter I think). There&#x27;s also Newspeak, which is highly experimental, and LivelyKernel (by Dan Ingals) which again transplants some of the more important ST ideas into the browser. And all that on top of mainstream languages gaining more and more features which Smalltalkers are used to. It&#x27;s certainly an interesting time to be a part of Smalltalk community.",1408126513

Aside from a &quot;magic&quot; solution, like the singularity, I do not expect in my life-time to see a post-scarcity society arise.<p>I do agree that the automation of jobs is not a serious cause of concern, though obviously for those whose jobs are displaced it will be. People can&#x27;t stand to sit around and do nothing for any great stretch of time (although everyone claims otherwise).

It&#x27;s a short term,  open-ended arrangement.<p>We have been trying to come up with a fair contract, given that there are limited cash assets,and that this is more or less an internship.  My boss spends twenty minutes a day giving me code review and direction, which is valuable for me at this early stage in my career.<p>What is a fair rate? Do I charge less given the mentorship I receive? We work well together, and are both motivated to make this work.<p>We&#x27;ve worked out one benchmark per week, and are trying to figure out a contract. The company has limited cash resources.<p>Thanks for any guidance.",1408125769

Productivity will rise to the new heights.

If that definition is did you have any event in the past where you came out better because of your LinkedIn; I am inclined to say no, or maybe the classic answer I got a job and they probably checked my profile.<p>However, I recently had to turn off the &quot;interested in career opportunities&quot; because the huge amount of recruiters offering jobs. I imagine if I come to be without work, or want to switch jobs, all it takes is turn that option back on. Within a week I will probably have a job.<p>In addition, I have people in my network who I do not speak to frequently (other companies, previous shared European projects, etc). I would probably forget their name, or not be able to attach a name without seeing the face for some of them. I can use LinkedIn as a quick reminder on who I need to contact as it shows a face, their line of work, and experience usually.<p>So, back to your question on value. Not directly, but I have means to get in contact with persons who otherwise who be one step further away. It might help.<p>Alternative answer: you can turn this around and say it only helps because everybody thinks it helps. Therefor is on LinkedIn and thus checks it and can be connected. So I could also answer with no, but what would replace it then?",1408125643

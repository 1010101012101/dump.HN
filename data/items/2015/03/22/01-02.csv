I.e. Jewish law forbids carrying objects between public and private domain on Shabbos. What is considered private and public domain has quite clear definitions. So using that method (of connecting areas with some wires or ropes) one changes the status of the area in light of the law from public to private domain. I.e. the law applies all the same, but its subject is different, so carrying becomes permitted.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html</a>",1426989521

The point is that there&#x27;s a filter and its effects aren&#x27;t necessarily known to us, so it&#x27;s hard to deduce what&#x27;s wrong when some people don&#x27;t show up.<p>Except for the creepers issue (which only can be solved by bringing it up to the organizers), thats on the fault of the attendee.

You don&#x27;t have to physically touch it to own it. There is a concept of &quot;clearing&quot;, once the money clears it&#x27;s yours. The dispute is if it&#x27;s enough to avoid clearing payments, or if you should avoid taking any orders altogether.<p>> It would be the equivalent of delegating that responsibility to a non-jew. I don&#x27;t know how would that be ruled, but I remember reading that it&#x27;s allowed to let non-jew servants perform tasks on the sabbath, though I have no idea if it&#x27;s accepted by the Hasidics.<p>The rule there is not in dispute, Hasidics are the same as any other observant Jews.<p>The rule is you can not pay a non-Jews to work specifically on Sabbath. However you can pay him to work, and let him decide when to do it, as long as you give enough time to complete the work not on the Sabbath, if he decides to work on the Sabbath that&#x27;s none of your concern, he&#x27;s not Jewish as is not required to keep the Sabbath. You can also pay by the week and then the payment is not for the Sabbath.<p>Incidentally a slave (even a non-Jewish slave) is not allowed to work for you on Sabbath, also animals are not allowed to work for you. Computers however are not alive - automatic processes are unquestionably permitted. AI (if it&#x27;s possible, which I don&#x27;t think it is) will be very interesting.",1426989403

It is being a believer in some god (so, a <i>theist</i>) as well as an anarchist.<p>ALL your examples were people that are very clearly not atheists, since all of these examples involved <i>believing in one god</i>. They are only various examples of monotheist practices.<p>There can not be branches of atheism - and I know I&#x27;m exposing myself to a misguided answer making reference to the no true Scotsman fallacy, but it would be wrong. The very etymology of &quot;atheism&quot; leaves no place to branches: if you believe that a god exists, good, even if you think there is only one this still leaves many ways to believe in it... <i>however</i>, if you believe that no god exists, which is what atheism is, there is only one way for something not to exist at all.<p>There is a fundamental difference between believing something exists and believing something does not exist. Believing that it does not exist is a very simple belief, with no possible nuances while believing in the existence of something does leave place to interpretation.",1426989319

A key thing that Pia said in her TED talk: technology is only a tool here, cultural change and reinvention is necessary. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to play with DemocracyOS yet, but the focus does somewhat seem to be on &quot;direct democracy&quot; (as opposed to &quot;representative&quot;), and as others have pointed out, that&#x27;s fraught with problems.<p>But I hope and believe this is just a first, experimental step. And I hope that next steps will be informed by the rich tradition of experimentation in &quot;participatory, deliberative democracy&quot;. This includes things like citizen assemblies, citizen juries, participatory budgeting, wisdom councils, etc. What these approaches have in common is a blending of citizen participation with informed deliberation, often including a random sampling (of citizens).<p>As two superb examples of this, I would point to the Citizen&#x27;s Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia, Canada, 2004) and the Dialogue with the City (Perth, Australia, 2003).

The beta will among other things serve as a stress test, giving me an idea of the server resources necessary for the service. That will give me an idea of the costs associated with running the SaaS, which will help decide the user fees. For the moment I simply have too little data, sorry. I intend it to be very affordable, if it helps.<p>I understand you being worried that a service you use may disappear. But realistically that can happen with absolutely any SaaS. Being backed by a big company is no guarantee in this regard, as Google has shown with google reader and other services. My intention is to keep Feedbunch running for as long as possible, but I was also burned by the GReader shutdown so I understand your concern. The best I can offer is this: Feedbunch has an OPML export feature, so any user can take his subscriptions to any other feed reader that supports OPML whenever he wants. That&#x27;s the best way to avoid vendor lock-in: to work with interoperable standards so that you can take your data elsewhere if necessary. And of course being opensource you can self-host it.<p>In case you&#x27;re interested I originally built Feedbunch for myself when GReader closed down, because I was unhappy with the alternatives. I&#x27;ve been using it for my feed reading needs for some time. Offering it as a SaaS is an extension of that, but the project started as a way for me to have a reader I liked. I&#x27;m not aiming to catch the eye of a big company here, but to run a good service.<p>That was a bit all over the place but I hope I addressed your questions.",1426989103

9245134,comment,9243169,9245001,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I am going to have to disagree with you.  The whiteboard question does <i>not</i> always work.  In fact, while I am generally able to do whiteboard questions without a problem, I had an experience 2 years ago where I completely blanked and was absolutely unable to write any code on a whiteboard.  If they had handed me a computer (or if I had not been too flabergasted to ask for one), I would have been fine.  In the end, the company in question lost out on my skills and I ended up at a different company.  Not really so bad for me, as I have never been scarce of job offers, but it made the problem very obvious to me.<p>It is easy to dismiss something that you have never experienced yourself.  Some people are good at whiteboard interviews and some are not.  In my experience, the ability to be good at whiteboard interviews is mostly independent of how good the person will be at their job.  The questions are either too difficult to avoid the stress-blanking issue, or too easy to weed out the barely-capable-but-not-someone-you-would-ideally-like-to-hire candidates.<p>We currently do pair-programming interviews with ping-pong.  I write a test, you write the production code, then you write a test and I write the production code.  We discuss programming issues as we go.  This seems to work well for people who are familiar with TDD and real pair programming (as opposed to: one guy codes and the other guy watches them).  It does not work so well for people who have never tried it, though.  We actually do most of our work this way, so finding people with this experience is good.  Unfortunately, I think we&#x27;ve almost certainly missed good talent just because they don&#x27;t immediately grasp how this process works.  We do some hand-holding at the interview, but then you are always wondering about the person&#x27;s actual ability.<p>@jimbobimbo, if you don&#x27;t mind some unsolicited advice, I would recommend that you revisit your stance on maintaining a few non-job projects.  A portfolio that shows what you can do on your own is unbelievably valuable (in terms of real dollars) when you are looking for the next job.  I have gotten good jobs in the past simply because someone stumbled across my portfolio and decided to hire me.  The time required is not all that bad -- say an hour or so 3 times a week for the next year or two would give you a really excellent portfolio.

Building that experience outside of work, also makes you much more valuable even if you don&#x27;t switch jobs.

I&#x27;ll be finding out about the financial and social costs of not taking medicines properly, and what can be done to stem the wastage.<p>[...]<p>> And poor compliance - or non-concordance to give it its politically correct name - isn&#x27;t just a problem for drug safety campaigners like Professor Shakir. Studies have shown that as many as 9 out 10 cases of rejection in people who have had kidney or heart transplants happen solely because they don&#x27;t take their pills properly. And if they don&#x27;t follow instructions, after all they have been through, then what chance do the rest of us have.<p>> About 20% of the population take their medicines properly and they get the full benefit. Another 40% take their medicines well enough to get some benefit - which is good. But 40% of people with diabetes and asthma and schizophrenia, high blood pressure, don&#x27;t take their medicines at all or they take them so erratically as to get no benefit and some harm.<p>> Yes, I&#x27;ve been doing my sums on this and these are approximate figures but last year UK GPs issued approximately 1 billion prescriptions, costing approximately £12 billion. If 40% of that is indeed wasted and we are fairly sure it is, that means that non-compliers are wasting somewhere around £5 billion per annum, that&#x27;s eight times the current hospital overspend that&#x27;s causing so much fuss in the media.<p>> And I have to emphasise - it&#x27;s the same in the USA, Sweden, Australia - any country where it&#x27;s been researched.<p>The English NHS has very strict rules and they will not take back meds. You can hand meds to your pharmacist but those get destroyed.  This is supposedly to protect the chain - to prevent counterfeit goods getting into the supply.

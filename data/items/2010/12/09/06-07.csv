1986456,comment,1986161,1986161,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Fantastic.<p>I wonder if all these very public proclamations are going to shift people's attitude towards taxes? Most people think of the government as wasteful, inefficient, incompetent, and corrupt to more or less degrees, and I know I'd prefer to see money allocated by smart people like Gates, Buffet, Zuckerberg than by politicians who need to keep constituents happy and win votes.<p>I committed a while back to giving 10% of my income to charity henceforth, probably for my whole life. I know I've felt much better when I raised money for St. Jude's or Grand Ormond Street children's hospitals than when I wrote a check to the IRS to fund the latest special interest-fueled debacle.<p>There's a ""the evil rich are against us"" narrative in movies and stories a lot, but I wonder if the perception will start to change when all the good from these endeavors is realized. I think it's quite likely that smart people allocating resources intelligently will do 10x, 20x, 50x more good with the money than a politician possibly could.",1291877819

Rape used to have to contain some element of <i>violence or threat of violence</i>, these days rape doesn't have to contain either. As Assange's accusors have conceded, it was <i>consensual</i> sex.<p>The feminist movement in Sweden is trying, has been for years, to expand the word ""rape"" to include less aggrievous stuff. This seems to be another attempt at expanding the definition of ""rape"" into meaning that the offender didn't ""honor the agreement"" of the ""sexual relation"". As if they had arrived at an agreement before they had sex.<p>I don't think they will win this case though. I expect Assange to be freed of all charges. Possibly a minor charge of non-sexual harassment, or something.",1291877811

Mark is a few years older than me, and I've already arrived at the decision that I'd do much the same as him if I ever had the same cash. He's bright, quite savvy regarding the public, and he's got a great inner stamina. I doubt he worries if he's capable of making money — maybe he'll never equal Facebook's success, in fact probably he won't, but I doubt if he started all over again today he'd fail to make himself a comfortable, cozy living.<p>It's not like he's being asked to live an ascetic lifestyle, though all stories I've read say that he's fairly minimal. He's just being asked to give away most of his money to help other people. In his case, ""most of his wealth"" still leaves him more than I've got at present.",1291877455

They did not follow the proper guidelines as some of the largest companies in the world to make sure their systems would be unaffected by various possible scenarios including DDoS attacks.",1291874825

I figure I have about ten years or so left before I have this unconquerable urge to shamelessly hit on 20 year olds and generally make a complete embarrassment out of myself - unless I can establish a family to ground me.<p>But yep - I think women really hit their stride once they satisfy the family urge and should not feel so pressured to achieve in their 20s and 30s...  I think they often make a mistake in thinking that they have to cram in career and family before they get old an infertile... and actually hurt themselves and their families by trying.  If they had more faith that they can make awesome contributions once the kids have matured somewhat I think they overall could have much fuller lives.<p>Interestingly - and I hope this doesn't sound off - but I actually struggle to relate to many young women. I honestly believe the breeding instinct is just rapacious and overwhelming (and it kinda has to be - cause there is a time limit on it).  And really is just horrid to deal with if you're a young inexperienced male.  Older women, on the other hand, are just awesome to talk to.<p>It's just strange that god (or evolution or whatever) would have it that just as the women are coming, the men are going.

This generates random connections between peers in the overlay.

Then search just works by broadcasting queries to nearby peers.<p>The algorithms used have dozens of applications outside of filesharing.

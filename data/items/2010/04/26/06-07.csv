The problem happened right after I added a switch at the end of the line, but the switch had been in service elsewhere and never had any problems.<p>It turned out the Ethernet cable was placed in a conduit that ran close to a conduit carrying a high-current two-phase 240V power line.  Most of the devices on that line were running and pulling huge amounts of current all the time, so I didn't originally suspect that the line was the problem.  But, there was a furnace on that line whose variable-speed blower was connected to a single 120V phase, and the unbalanced current draw on the power line created enough common-mode noise in the cat5e cable to throw off the switch.  The furnace came on periodically at night to heat the building, causing the packet loss.  The solution was to put a device at the end of the Ethernet cable with better common-mode rejection.",1272264327

If I waited till I had time to read everything that looked interesting, I'd miss most of the stuff that looked interesting. If I just queue it up, it can sit quietly in the background and wait for me to take a break from work.<p>I use different browsers to logically separate my groups of viewing habits. One is open for casual HN style surfing, one for a hobby I'm work on, one for work, one for school, one to isolate media apps like Pandora or Hulu, etc. Each has a queue of pages I was working on/reading/in the middle of something and had to run out to a meeting or whatever and didn't get back to it immediately. Heck I've had half-written replies in emails up for days in a separate browser with all of the related research tabs I was using while constructing the email up as well.<p>I tried to keeping myself to just a handful of tabs in a single window but I found I was missing so much good stuff I just gave it up.<p>I find this only works if you have a high abstract -> concrete learning style (sometimes called ""synthesizers""). Not everybody works that way and that's fine - but other workflows drive me batty. Once I've assembled everything in a browser instance, I can even let it go for a week or two, forgetting completely about it before returning devoting my attention to the ""concept"" of that instance -- the semantics of what it's for are all there because everything is grouped in an instance. I can dash off a several thousand word paper in just a few hours of focused concentration because all of the research is done and sitting there for me -- left by my past self.<p>But if, like most people, my attention wanders after a few hours, I can switch instances and immediately context shift to a completely different semantic set and let my mind chew on the other problem unconsciously.<p>Even IRL, when in college, I'd have different tables setup the same way for different classes or projects.

And that yelling makes conflict more difficult to resolve.  Which is important.  If you're trying to achieve a shared goal, then the inevitable conflict needs to be resolved so you can return to what is important - the shared goal.<p>My opinion on relationships is similar.  I've been married for 20 years.  And in that time I've learned the importance of finding ways to recognize conflict, de-escalate it, then re-engage and deal with the source of the conflict.  Furthermore I firmly believe that if I hadn't learned that lesson, I wouldn't still be married 20 years in.<p>For both cases, what are the key steps to turning theory into practice?<p>Step 1 for both cases is realizing that you have a choice.  Realizing that you do is the first step in making the choice you want.<p>Step 2 is recognizing that while you're in the grip of strong emotion you don't have much control.  That's why you need to develop the habit of disengaging when you go off the rails.  And since the same holds for other people, choose to be around people who have learned that lesson as well.<p>Step 3 is returning to the underlying issues and actually addressing them.  If you don't do that, you'll find yourself back at step 2 repeatedly until you do.  (Even so you'll wind up at step 2 from time to time.  But with less frequency.)",1272262144

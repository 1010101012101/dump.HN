If your first-stated reason &quot;to talk&quot; is &quot;more than 80% worth of discounts&quot;, then you&#x27;re going to have a bad time if the work you are outsourcing is at all highly-skilled. For highly-routinized process work by ops staff, sure, knock yourself out; but you&#x27;re going to find extremely qualified folks for that in the heartland of the US working for wages competitive with the offshore outfits as well.<p>How logical is it that you will find someone smart enough to hack full-stack or even a Fabrice Bellard-grade hacker, but not savvy enough to sift through sales channels until they command a rate commensurate with their demonstrated delivery capabilities? This is unicorn-hunting. They do exist, you can land them, but in the meantime your competitors are focusing on Getting Shit Done by not wasting time trying to prematurely optimize their expense structure. If these unicorns were so easily abundant, and if it was that easy, then Google would have long since abandoned recruiting at American universities.<p>You might have better results if you specified in more detail what you are looking for. Generally, my experience is that coding talent is roughly evenly smeared across the global pool; I&#x27;m looking generally for devops types that know their OS&#x27;s, basic data and control structures in an Algol&#x27;ish language (scripted and/or compiled), and work well when customer-facing. There isn&#x27;t enough difference between geographies to alter the basic recruitment search strategy though tactics will differ (the technical culture is relatively consistent across the globe). Not enough difference to yield dramatically better returns at least, so nationality won&#x27;t determine whether you get &quot;lower quality&quot; or &quot;outdated&quot; coders. In my experience, individuals&#x27; personalities and company culture has a far greater impact on code quality than nationality or ethnicity.<p>In my market space, given how long it really takes to absorb a significant technical base, on the order of 12-18 months, I&#x27;m not inclined to &quot;yield chase&quot; by trying to find cheap technical staff with a turnover that is frequently sooner than that spin-up time before truly insightful work from them starts to get traction. YMMV, so please share your details.",1390881306

7135212,comment,7132562,7135087,1,0,ithinkso,,,"You&#x27;re right, maybe I do not understand because of different meaning of those words in english, which is not, in fact, my native language, but let me try explain you what I think.<p>From wikipedia we read:<p><i>Turing completeness<p>A computational system that can compute every Turing-computable function is called Turing complete (or Turing powerful). Alternatively, such a system is one that can simulate a universal Turing machine.</i><p>From the first part I think compute means that from some input A there is output B. It is later explained in &#x27;computable function&#x27; article:<p><i>Each computable function f takes a fixed, finite number of natural numbers as arguments. Note that the functions are partial in general, i.e. they may not be defined for every possible choice of input. If a computable function is defined for a certain input, then it returns a single natural number as output (this output can be interpreted as a list of numbers using a pairing function).</i><p>So if computable function is returning something that means it halts. We are able to compute every halting algorithm in preprocessor hence it is turing complete.<p>Second part of this definitions says that one has to simulate turing machine (and uses the word &#x27;alternatively&#x27; so basically it has to be the same but I can go anyway). I think that &#x27;simulate&#x27; in this context mean &#x27;producing same output&#x27; rather than &#x27;doing step by step the same&#x27;. Internal tape states at certain point in time should not matter because while running they might change (or if they matter we could just return list of pair {state,time} at the end).<p>There is no doubt that non-halting turing machines exists but I&#x27;m not sure if that apply to this particular problem anyhow since they are not computing anything.",1390881264

Their Helper T cells (the CD4s mentioned) are being rapidly co-opted by the virus and subject to destruction. In such an environment it is difficult to mount an immune response because the Helper T cells are so instrumental to enabling the cytotoxic immune responses instigated by this study (the CD8 cells are your cytotoxic &quot;killer&quot; T cells).<p>Any trial run on humans already suffering from AIDS would be muddied by this effect, where the already compromised immune system cannot mount a robust response even were it able to develop CD8 killer cells specific to the HIV epitope they vaccinate with.<p>Phase I trials are high risk, and especially for a bootstrapped team like this, have a lot riding on them. An early failure can doom a technology in this industry, so it is important to focus on testing in an environment where you have the best shot at success.

I think there&#x27;s a key distinction to be made here between two reasons why corporate owners/executives get more upside: one is a good reason and one is not.<p>The good reason is that owners and executives have to deal with all the business risks that you talked about in the other subthread: finding product-market fit, raising capital, how to scale, etc. Workers don&#x27;t; they come to work, do a job, and go home. Like it or not, it&#x27;s easier to find people who will do the latter than it is to find people who will do the former; so, since the former type of person is scarce, they can demand more upside in exchange for the use of their talents.<p>The bad reason why corporate owners/executives get more upside is basically the one that&#x27;s been given multiple times in this thread: corporate owners/executives are in a position to take more upside by abusing the corporate governance structure, whereas workers are not. (Unions were an attempt to stop this by giving workers more of a voice in the corporate governance structure; unfortunately, in many cases, the unions have ended up with exactly the same governance problems as the corporations they were supposedly fighting against. I saw this firsthand when I was working in the auto industry.) In fact, in many cases it&#x27;s executives manipulating the structure for their own benefit at the expense of the <i>owners</i>, not just the workers. This is easier now that many &quot;owners&quot; are large mutual funds rather than individuals holding large blocks of stock, so the theoretical model of shareholders controlling the company by voting their shares bears little resemblance to reality in many cases.<p>One reason why I like the &quot;why not start your own business?&quot; response to this issue is that I think a larger percentage of people really are capable of dealing with the business risks themselves, instead of letting someone else (the owners/executives of the business they work for) do it. I think our society would work better, overall, if we had a larger number of smaller, more diverse businesses as opposed to a smaller number of large, monolithic corporations. The large, monolithic corporations are a historical artifact of the way the industrial revolution happened, and I think that in many ways they have outlived their usefulness.",1390879903

Most companies use Experian or Equifax to do some sort of credit verification by asking these questions.

I don&#x27;t understand how this isn&#x27;t libel, since they are spreading false information about me, and that drastically affected my credit, and I had to jump through hoops to get everything corrected.<p>The thing that really sucks is that Experian STILL has the wrong information about me, so when I&#x27;m asked these credit questions, it&#x27;s mixed with the other person&#x27;s data, so I always fail the credit check.

This might not be stored explicitly (it could be stored as a pair of pointers) but it is not unavailable.  It is also necessarily available to the deallocator, which must in some way be aware of what it is marking as free.  As I said, this might only be an approximation of the size of the array, though for bounds checking purposes it would usually be good enough (since nothing else should be allocated in the &quot;excess&quot; space that is marked as in-use).<p>&quot;Passing the array along with its size further goes to prove the original statement, not refute it. If you have to do something manually, it strongly implies that the language/runtime isn&#x27;t doing it for you.&quot;<p>Take a closer look at the original statement.  He did not merely say that the size is unavailable to programmers, he said it is not available at all.  That is not really true -- it is more that the compiler does not do anything useful with the information.<p>To put it another way, a compiler could conceivably emit bounds-checking code but still not provide programmers with an explicit way to get the size of an array.  The result would be the same:  programmers would still be forced to pass array sizes around, to avoid a call to abort (or whatever behavior occurs when a bounds check failed).",1390879199

You are saying that since they are not, people should start businesses.</i><p>That&#x27;s part of what I&#x27;m saying, but not all. Another part of what I&#x27;m saying is that, if the premise is that current corporations are not sharing enough upside with employees, then one obvious response is to start a business that <i>does</i> share upside with employees. If that&#x27;s really as big a deal as people are claiming, employees should flock to such a business. Only some of those who are now dissatisfied would actually have to start such businesses; the rest could simply choose to work for them because they treat employees better.<p><i>I challenge you to cite references to actual regulations that are to any &quot;large extent&quot; preventing actual small businesses from starting.</i><p>First of all, it&#x27;s not just starting but <i>growing</i> businesses that should be less impeded by regulation. Sure, start a business with only a few employees and the burden might not be too bad (depending on what kind of business it is--see below); but hit a fairly small threshold number of employees and all of a sudden you have regulations galore that you have to comply with or a dozen government agencies will come after you.<p>As for regulatory barriers to starting businesses, here are a few off the top of my head: professional licensing, even for professions like hairdressing where any putative benefit to the customer is far outweighed by the costs of the barrier to entry; zoning laws that clearly go way beyond any public benefit; government sweetheart deals for companies like cable providers, which prevent all kinds of competition in the ISP arena. That&#x27;s just from a few minutes of brainstorming; I&#x27;m sure there are plenty more examples.<p><i>the implication in the Reuter&#x27;s article is that businesses are doing just fine in the current regulatory environment.</i><p>That&#x27;s because they (i.e., existing businesses) paid good money for the current regulatory environment. That does not at all imply that said environment is good for potential competitors of those existing businesses; if it were, they&#x27;d be complaining to their politicians that they weren&#x27;t getting their money&#x27;s worth.<p><i>I doubt many here will cite regulations as a key challenge. Instead, it&#x27;s actual business problems, such as product development, finding market-fit, competition, marketing, lack of capital, inability to scale, etc.</i><p>But all of these business problems are also faced by existing businesses. Markets are not static; a product-market fit that worked fine yesterday might not work fine today, and businesses that serve their customers well often have to reinvent themselves. The response of many existing businesses (the music and movie industries being two outstanding examples), instead of reinventing themselves, is to try to outlaw their competition. The fact that those businesses continue to make profits even though there are obvious ways in which they are not serving their <i>customers</i> well (let alone their employees) indicates that their political efforts to get the playing field tilted in their favor have been successful.",1390878791

The economies they govern continue to operate. Some of them very prosperously.<p>Spying by the US government could be cut back VERY sharply and do the US no harm, especially against those governments that are both friendly and that cannot support an effective spying mechanism against the US.<p>There is a ton of Hobbesian bullshit floating around here. We&#x27;d be cheating on all our treaties, too, just because some countries do that, if this whole &quot;state of nature&quot; bullshit actually applied.",1390878202

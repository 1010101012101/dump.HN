If you want the Moore neighborhood (tuples whose absolute sum is less than or equal to &quot;n&quot;), you can add a filtering step:<p><pre><code>  def moore_neighborhood(n, d):\n	seq = product(*[range(-n, n+1) for _ in range(d)])\n	return filter(lambda x: sum(map(abs, x)) <= n, seq)\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s probably a more efficient way of doing this for Moore neighborhoods, but I didn&#x27;t come across it when I was looking into such things.\nThe problem lies in the fact that as &quot;d&quot; grows large, you&#x27;re throwing away more and more of &quot;seq&quot;, so while it looks elegant, you might need something a little less terse in practice.",1454385559

One is distance along the \n   track, and the other is which track it&#x27;s on. The track \n   centers are often 15 or 20 feet apart; GPS may not be \n   good enough to determine which track it&#x27;s on. \n</code></pre>\nIf you don&#x27;t know what track your train&#x27;s on, your GPS fix is the least of your problems.<p>How, exactly, would a train end up on the wrong track without being flagged by an existing sensing mechanism other than human eyes?  That would be the problem to tackle first.<p><pre><code>   There are other systems that determine that. But now you \n   want to integrate those other systems with the GPS, and \n   now the problem is much less simple than &quot;there&#x27;s this \n   thing called GPS&quot;.\n</code></pre>\nNo, I don&#x27;t necessarily expect it to be thoroughly integrated right away.  But simply having the GPS system as a secondary sanity check on speed seems worthwhile.<p>It&#x27;s all about the fail-safe concept.  If you know you&#x27;re building an imperfect system, then you should build it such that the most likely failure modes result in temporary inconvenience rather than hot flaming atomic death.  At some point, someone must have <i>actively decided</i> that this engineering principle shouldn&#x27;t apply to trains.  Otherwise simple sanity checks based on GPS, inertial measurement, or what-have-you would already be in place.<p><pre><code>   > Why are humans even in this particular loop? It&#x27;s a \n   train, not a car or an aircraft!\n\n   If you don&#x27;t have absolute control of your right-of-way, \n   you&#x27;d better have actual eyeballs up front. A car can\n   stall on a crossing. \n</code></pre>\nThe only way the engineer can possibly know about this in time to do anything about it is to rely on sensors that are already there.  Trains can take thousands of feet to stop.<p><pre><code>   Some drunk can be walking down the track. Some drunk can \n   even be driving down the track. Somebody can even be \n   trying to move a house across the tracks (I&#x27;ve seen a \n   photo of the aftermath of that one).\n</code></pre>\nAnd the engineer can do what about any of those things, other than watch the carnage unfold from the best seat in the house?  Other than report the obstruction to other trains, which again could/should have been automatic, the answer is &quot;Not much.&quot;<p><pre><code>   And if you&#x27;re going to say, &quot;if the photos of the \n   aftermath, the train didn&#x27;t stop in time, so what&#x27;s the \n   point of the engineer?&quot;, well, the engineer can try to \n   minimize the damage by seeing that some idiot is trying \n   to move a house across the tracks, and coming as close \n   as possible to stopping where he shouldn&#x27;t have to stop \n   at all.\n</code></pre>\nTrains don&#x27;t work that way.  By the time the engineer sees an obstruction with his own eyes, there <i>will</i> be a violent collision.<p>The train will generally win its fight against an errant pedestrian or a car or even a house, so the exact speed of the collision doesn&#x27;t matter that much.  To derail a train, something <i>really</i> stupid has to happen... like this.<p><pre><code>    >It&#x27;s not going anywhere it didn&#x27;t go before, and it \n    has no business going 1 MPH faster or slower past any \n    given point on the track than it did the last time!\n\n   Slower trains ahead of it. \n</code></pre>\nGod, I hope the people working on self-driving cars don&#x27;t make the mistake of overlooking something that obvious.<p><pre><code>   Temperature too hot, so sun kinks are possible. \n</code></pre>\nNot familiar with that phenomenon, but how does the engineer know about it, what&#x27;s he supposed to do about it, and why is his manual judgment or intervention helpful?<p><pre><code>   Temperature too low, so pull-aparts are possible. \n</code></pre>\nSame questions.<p><pre><code>    Too much rain, so a river may have washed out a bridge. \n</code></pre>\nUnless there&#x27;s an automated network of sensors that tells the engineer about it, some people are going swimming.  It&#x27;s that simple.<p><pre><code>   Some kind of event right next to the tracks, so go slow \n   and watch for people where they shouldn&#x27;t be. \n</code></pre>\nIn the aviation business, this is handled by issuing what&#x27;s called a &quot;NOTAM&quot; (notice to airmen.)  Automate them.<p><pre><code>   Maintenance work on the track next door, so go slow and \n   use the horn a lot, because sometimes those workers \n   forget to pay attention to what&#x27;s happening on the next \n   track. \n</code></pre>\nHow about:<p><pre><code>   while (maintenance_scheduled_nearby() || \n          movement_detected_nearby())\n       { \n       speed--; \n       sound_horn();\n       }\n</code></pre>\nDisclaimer: system not evaluated for stability. :)<p><pre><code>   Those are just off the top of my head.  Then there&#x27;s \n   BART, which did exactly what you said - they automated \n   it. One day a train misread an instruction from a \n   sensor, and tried to go 68 MPH when it should have been \n   stopping for a station. The station happened to be \n   the end of the (elevated) line. I forget whether that \n   killed any people or not.\n</code></pre>\nWhile tragic, isolated events like this won&#x27;t stop self-driving cars from taking over eventually, nor should they.  Same story with trains.  The fact is, computers will get better at this stuff over time.

He was pressured into porting Jinja2 and it cooled him on Python, if you read older posts of his. The answer should be pretty clear when you notice that Lektor fails on a print() not having parentheses (and not, say, a dependency).<p>Unicode in Python 3 is his problem, and there was one post I can&#x27;t find on mobile where he started ranting about POSIX and Unix for some unclear reason. I can&#x27;t follow him on a lot of it, as much as I respect his work, because if you read objectively it&#x27;s pretty clear the reasoning is often there to support a predisposition. Meanwhile, my whole stack is Python 3 and I&#x27;m having a grand old time less the pieces where I had to sub in shittier libraries, and not a single problem Armin has ever raised about Python 3 has hit us. Not one. Most of it boils down to Unicode issues that have been issues outside of Python for 20 years.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say Python 3 is perfect. (Far from it.)<p>He also often writes what I like to call the &quot;Alex Gaynor Conclusion,&quot; which is tediously enumerating in the conclusion why you&#x27;re going to call him wrong in his opinions which somewhat minimizes effectively disagreeing with him. There is a subculture of people who do this, and it mildly bugs me. Nothing against him; just an observation.<p>Anyway, port it and drop a patch, and I&#x27;ll buy you scotch. I know better than to make any request other than that, and it&#x27;s cooled <i>me</i> on using Armin&#x27;s software in general (to my disappointment; Armin&#x27;s Web stack has been a trusted friend through four different employers, from Werkzeug on up, and it&#x27;s a massive bummer to see Lektor confirm suspicion).",1454384312

Look for them to continue manipulate their black box (quality score) to help inflate CPCs, blend paid ads into organic (a la Baidu), reduce the number of organic results per page, increase the prominence of Shopping campaigns, remove advertiser control (no true exact match, or no exact match at all?) and generally try to squeeze SMBs by reducing organic visibility and subtly suggesting to try AdWords.

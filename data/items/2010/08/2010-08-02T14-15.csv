That is 10x less than during the Afghan civil war of the 1990s, and far less (2+ orders of magnitude) than the Soviet invasion.<p>Are these comparative numbers meant to excuse the unnecessary 30k deaths caused by US interference?  Because I assume you must know that it doesn't work like that.  If it did hostage situations would be a great deal easier.  Just kill everyone involved because the hostage taker would have likely caused more damage then we did anyway, right?<p>> If I lived in South Sudan, Somalia, or Eastern Congo, I would welcome a US/international invasion and occupation, even if it meant a 5-10% chance of death for me of my family.<p>Those are some bad places to be sure, but I don't think you comprehend what an occupation is exactly.  Do you remember the L.A. riots?  Everything was out of control, innocent people were dying, the police were powerless.  A news anchor asked a member of the military who was on the show ""at what point should the military get involved"" to which the military person replied ""Please don't bring in the military"".

How many concurrent TCP/IP sessions do you think that ""free"" Comcast cable router will support? I can guarantee you that you can overrun it's capabilities with even a single dedicated server. You might have a few spare UPSs lying around, but what about HVAC? What are you going to do when a squirrel blows the only circuit servicing your home? Sure, your servers and connection might stay up, but how long can you run without overheating? When you enumerate the things that data centers have, and your garage does not, I can't see how it makes any sense.<p>* Redundant electricity/generators
* Real HVAC systems (also on generators)
* Fire suppression systems
* Redundant connectivity
* Connections that can handle high levels of concurrency
* Secure facility<p>Never underestimate the impact of downtime to your business' viability. At any given moment, your service will be ""critical"" to someone. Often times, the loss of confidence can't be regained, and to be brutally honest, that loss of confidence would be justified given that you think it's ok to run your hosting out of a garage.<p>Given how small the cost delta is between hosting infrastructure at your home versus paying for something like a VPS, you're assigning a very small value to your customer's importance. As a customer, how am I supposed to feel about that? That is probably the single greatest reason more startups aren't doing this. You have to fight and claw for every customer you get. I'm not willing to have them walk out the door because I decided I could save $70/month on hosting by doing it from my garage. If you can't sustain the hosting costs required to run your business today, you won't be able to do it six months from now. Time to reassess your model.",1280760622

The top would appear to spin forever at in dreams closer to reality or reality itself because of how much slower time flows at the lower levels.  However, the top will not spin infinitely.  It will eventually stop when it finishes spinning in the deep nested dream reality, therefore I don't think it is necessarily a great indicator of reality if it topples over or not because it will stop spinning eventually.<p>At least this is how I read it.

If you live in the United States, you live in a <i>free-er</i> country than North Korea, and indeed, that's something to be grateful for, but you do not live in a truly free country.<p>In a truly free country, you would, for example, have the freedom to eat whatever you want (so long as it doesn't impinge on other people's freedoms). You would be able to have sex with whoever you wanted (so long as both parties are 'mature enough' to agree). This too, is not the case in the states. You would be able to marry whoever you wanted. You would be able to do to your body whatever you wanted. In a truly free country, you would have the freedom to do things that in today's non-free country we consider taboo, punishable offenses.

We're trying to work around this by asking lenders to ""confirm"" the loan at the time they do it, but it's a necessarily imperfect workaround that we're refining in our next iteration.  If for some reason a lender doesn't click to confirm the loan, the lender's book loan offer remains live and triggers reminders when there are other borrowers for the title.<p>To stop lending request reminders for a particular title, you can delete the loan offer from your profile: <a href=""http://www.kindlelendingclub.com/myprofile.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kindlelendingclub.com/myprofile.htm</a><p>If you need help or have feedback, we're just an email away: info@kindlelendingclub.com",1296245288

So a programmer, having never heard of or cares about Stackoverflow, interested in only finding a specific answer that includes their Google query, might see nothing wrong with the eFreedom response. Suppose the majority doing Google searches preferred eFreedom based on measured clicks. Should the fact that Stackoverflow was the originator of the content guarantee them a higher page rank? What if Stackoverflow was slow? And stepping back from these two specific sites, how do you deal with that across all sites and their clones?<p>I avoid eFreedom links because I enjoy participating in Stackoverflow and use the other features, and despite the assurances of the folks at eFreedom the site still seems shady.

2153286,comment,2152439,2152888,0,0,samdk,,,"The short answer: not a whole lot. A government or other entity with enough resources could probably compromise the anonymity of a significant amount of the traffic going through Tor. It's generally accepted that if an attacker controls the first and last router in a circuit then they can use timing attacks to compromise that circuit's anonymity. (And if an attacker controls all three routers they definitely can.)<p>The long answer:\nTor does some things with circuit creation to try to make this kind of attack a lot more difficult. In general, clients will attempt to choose geographically distributed routers to go together on a circuit. (I believe the restriction is that they won't choose multiple relays on the same /16 subnet--certainly not an infallible measure, but it does make it more difficult to control multiple routers on a single circuit.)<p>Another countermeasure is the use of <i>guard nodes</i>. Guard nodes are generally fast, long-running routers that serve as the entry points onto Tor. Clients with guards enabled (and they're enabled by default) have a list of 3 guard nodes, which they will try to use if at all possible as the first router on any circuits they create. (If all of those guards go down, they'll pick more.) The reasoning is that without guards, if there's someone who's trying to attack Tor by controlling routers, eventually you're going to create enough circuits that at least one gets compromised. With guards, some people will get unlucky and potentially have a lot more of their traffic compromised, but others will be much safer. Also, because guards stay relatively static over time (and because it takes a few weeks to be considered stable enough to be a guard), any attacker just setting up a ton of routers isn't going to be able to immediately compromise a ton of traffic.<p>(Of course, there are other attacks too, which don't necessarily require controlling nearly as many routers. Tor is very far from perfect. Designing a good general-purpose low-latency anonymity system is very difficult.)<p>My experience: I've been doing research related to Tor for the past two and a half years, and my undergrad thesis (which I'm working on right now) is a practical evaluation of the attacks that do exactly this kind of end-to-end correlation.<p>I don't have time right now to list specific citations for all of the above, but it's pretty much all covered by papers in the Free Haven Anonymity Bibliography (<a href=""http://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/</a>) and the Tor spec documents, and I'd be happy to come fill them in later if people want.",1296244827

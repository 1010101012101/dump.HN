A VC will fund something really risky and innovative if and only if they think they&#x27;ll likewise make a larger profit from it compared less risky ventures. But as pointed out by other commenters even this risk-taking is limited.<p>Ventures like SpaceX and Tesla that have a long lead time and (at least in these two cases) are loss-making at the start probably wouldn&#x27;t get YC-VC funding. Or at least they wouldn&#x27;t get anywhere near the level of funding they&#x27;d need to get to profitability point.<p>I wager that for some of the really big world-changing projects we simply have to be willing to fund it as long as necessary, taking an extremely long-term view. And for this, VC funding is probably not going to be enough. Both Tesla and SpaceX needed to take in public (read: Government) funding to keep going.",1395277178

If the car has a conventional key ignition, turning the key even to the accessory position can engage the steering wheel lock. Without a running engine, you could lose power brake and steering assist. Not all power steering systems are hydraulic, some are pure electric and some are electro-hydraulic. The majority of braking systems are assisted by a booster driven off of engine vacuum. You have two or three pedal pumps before the vacuum is gone.",1395277171

7433060,comment,7431640,7432821,3,0,kylebrown,,,"> But if that&#x27;s the case for the US, what&#x27;s stopping a thief to send money to an exchange like Bitstamp, buy BTC, withdraw it and then reverse the fiat payment in a similar matter?<p>Sending money to bitstamp requires an international wire transfer (SWIFT), those (usually) can&#x27;t be reversed.<p>Its ACH payments which get reversed so easily (ACH is a domestic network, all in-country). That&#x27;s why TradeHill shut down after a fraudulent $20k Dwolla payment, all Dwolla deposits/withdrawals are through ACH. And that&#x27;s why Coinbase has to be so careful with which customers they allow to purchase bitcoins, all Coinbase deposits/withdrawals are ACH.<p>> And while it&#x27;s true that on Bitalo you have to handle the fiat payments yourself, but it will be often faster to get BTC that way than to send it to an exchange, wait for them to process the deposit, and only then buy BTC.<p>Speed of a first purchase is one thing. But I&#x27;d guess that the main reason people keep funds on an exchange is because they want to day-trade, pick up cheap coins with a lucky limit order during a flash crash, or have the option to panic sell in a split second (not even a one hour wait for 6 confirmations). That kind of trading is only possible on an exchange with a limit order book, not an OTC marketplace.",1395276985

7433058,comment,7432217,7432217,0,0,peter_schwarz,,,"This is a great introduction to Stoicism for the modern world.  The author takes quite a few of the concepts and updates them through a 21st century philosophic viewpoint (mainly through the use of more rigorous logic behind the scenes).<p>The best update comes with how one should deal with things one can and cannot effect.  He updates this from two to three:  things you have no effect on whatsoever, things you have some effect on, and things you have total control of. Earthquakes are one on example of the first - no idea of when they are coming and one just has to do her best to deal with it. The second involves dealing with other people: one can control what one says and does to another, but no control over how that person reacts.  Third, one has control over oneself.<p>There are a few ideas in there that I think don&#x27;t pass modern studies of sociology/psychology - the chapter on relationships , in particular - but otherwise a very compelling read.",1395276967

7433018,comment,7431369,7431710,6,0,cmbaus,,,"Not all Bloomberg users are traders though, and that&#x27;s where I would try to challenge them. I worked on software for many years that was used side by side with Bloomberg. Many of our customers were Bloomberg customers as well -- although our software was a bit more niche and we didn&#x27;t hit the heights that Bloomberg did. But when I doubted if we were in the right business, I would look over to Bloomberg and convince myself that the money was there for the right products.<p>While Bloomberg has almost any conceivable piece of data in real time, what they were missing was presentation. For instance, if you wanted to make a presentation to your board which demonstrated your value as a money manager, you&#x27;d have to leave Bloomberg to do it. That&#x27;s how we were able to share space with them. But I&#x27;ve heard rumors they are moving in this direction now.<p>I also agree with the author that the data is really the lynch pin. Some commonly used data can be very expensive to acquire if you are able to get it at all. For instance try finding out what stocks and weights make up the Russell 2000 index (and then legally redistribute that data). We were fortunate in that we got in the business when data vendors were willing to negotiate with small software vendors. And much of the value we offered was in those accumulated contracts.<p>Once those contracts are in place it is very difficult for either side to cancel them without pissing off their customers. For instance a couple years ago FactSet and Morningstar got into a spat and FactSet&#x27;s contract to provide Morningstar data wasn&#x27;t renewed. All hell broke loose on both sides. They made a deal. Data is pretty big chasm for a startup to cross. And users are particular about what data vendors they use, even for nearly equivalent products.<p>There have been some reasonable exits in the financial software business that don&#x27;t get much play in the Valley. For instance BlackDiamond sold their reporting package (again presentation) to Advent in San Francisco for about $70million and eVestment has been taking on investment and growing like crazy. But neither of those companies competed head to head with Bloomberg&#x27;s core business. But they are big enough markets that I could see Bloomberg wanting to grow into them.<p>In general, if you want a slice of the market that Bloomberg is in, I don&#x27;t think it would easy to do it head on over data. You have to outflank them where they are weak, and hope to chip away at their mindshare that way.",1395276435

We don&#x27;t need a central authority to match trades, no more than we need a central authority to prevent double-spends. When you post an offer to trade XRP for snapswapUSD on ripple, the XRP remains 100% in your control (until someone takes your offer and a trade is matched). Ripple shows how trade matching can be implemented as a decentralized cryptographic &quot;contract&quot;.<p>Of course, this won&#x27;t work with bitcoin as the native currency until somebody implements trade matching as a bitcoin contract (and exchanges like bitstamp issue bitstampUSD as colored bitcoins). And even then, there&#x27;s still the fact that bitstampUSD is centrally issued and could all turn worthless the moment Bitstamp stopped redeeming it. And that has another solution (coins which track fiat-price in a decentralized prediction market).",1395274148

It involves engaging with your potential long-term officemate for longer than a 45 minute face-to-face session. Have them write actual, working code (or whatever... depending on their intended role) -- maybe  even pay them for the time they spend on this process with you, so they don&#x27;t feel like you wasted their time if you decide not to hire them. Basically, approach this function with the same level seriousness and goodwill that you&#x27;d bring to any business dealing with people outside your company.<p>What is that you say? You don&#x27;t have time for that style of hiring process? Well you can either have a better process or a fast/simple process for judging people for long term compatibility. People generally don&#x27;t get into long term relationships with other people after a 45 minute (mostly one-way) quiz.<p>2) Do you really expect a working professional to remember the details of each bug that they fixed in their career?

You&#x27;re implying that they&#x27;re offloading their bonds, they are far from it. China sold off an insignificant portion of their holdings for liquidity to bail out themselves. They were facing an economic crash and they were trying to stave it off. They needed cash to do that, hence, they sold a very specific amount of their bonds for that specific purpose.<p>If they sold <i>all</i> of their treasury bonds, it would be economic suicide because there would be so much unstableness in the global economy that <i>every</i> market would crash, including Chinas. They would probably fall the hardest, too.",1443891584

The heat equation is well-posed, which among other things, means that the solution depends continuously of the input data.

I had a decent job, so I signed up with all services (HD, phone and internet) After a few months, I realized I didn&#x27;t need a phone and didn&#x27;t care at all about HDTV. So I called and told them I&#x27;d be backing down my service to Internet and normal cable. I got a guy that informed me that I was under a 2 year contract and had no choice. He was absolutely terrible.... like so mean and insulting. I took it for a bit then I realized, I don&#x27;t have to be yelled at by a CS rep! I told him that I felt very uncomfortable with the way he was talking to me. He got even more belligerent. It was surreal, I have never had someone speak to me like this. He told me I was stuck, and that his hands were tied. I hung up. I called back because I realized he might just have been full of &quot;poo-poo&quot;. I got another CS rep. She was very pleasant. She said, &quot;Mr Nobleach, it appears you&#x27;re under contract.&quot; I said, &quot;that&#x27;s fair, can you send me a copy of the signed contract?&quot; she replied, &quot; well, your acceptance of equipment equates to a signed contact&quot;. I said, &quot;ok, the contract I didn&#x27;t sign will suffice. I do need my attorney to look over it&quot;. They agreed to knock me down to no contract and whatever service would work best. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the right course of action. I really did have an attorney wanting to look at my &quot;contract&quot;. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d stand no chance against Comcast.

10324469,comment,10324319,10324385,0,0,mindslight,,,"> <i>A common crippling meme among democratic societies is to absolve representatives of responsibility and instead keep insisting everything is the fault of citizens for not going to the ballot box, voting incorrectly at the ballot, and to keep trying again and again until they get it &quot;right&quot;, even if there are obvious inefficiencies in the democratic process that must be corrected. Where even the most ardent, statistically aware rationalist will succumb to their emotions and begin spouting feel-good drivel about voting. None of this is to be admired. It is to be condemned as insanity and self-hatred.</i><p>Well put.<p>However, democracy is inherently about the masses. I agree with your statement because I often find myself at odds with the masses (or apparently just ahead of them by 15 years, while they play catch up and groupthink transmutes freedom struggles into poor ideas and even oppression), and do not believe that tyranny of the majority is some ideal to strive for.<p>However, there are only two ways mass surveillance is going to stop - through technical means or through political means. I believe the technical means is the only practical avenue (even if there were political will to end the state-sponsored orgs and control the big-name mass surveillance companies, the business will continue behind the scenes). But I won&#x27;t detract from those attempting to do so through public means. Even if they do not succeed in [ae]ffecting the government, I would be quite happy if when talking to an arbitrary person there was a good chance they shared my values about privacy. That&#x27;s culture.<p>And to appeal to the masses, you have to fluff their sense of self-importance. So I&#x27;ll give someone a pass to operate within that framework when they&#x27;re fighting the good fight - if they were to tell the herd followers that following the herd sucked, they would convince no one of anything.<p>I would love to live in a world where most individuals&#x27; primary measure of an idea&#x27;s validity was not the number of other people who believe it, but I think that&#x27;s an even loftier goal than ending mass eavesdropping.",1443891202

Native has far more flexibility.<p>I&#x27;m not going to deny that native apps have more power to interact with hardware resourcesâ€”though I would question whether that&#x27;s a good thing for most applications I useâ€”but this isn&#x27;t a good place to draw a distinction. Window managers have to maintain the same security guarantees (look at the trickiness behind the impersonation protection in Windows Vista&#x27;s UAC for example), and that&#x27;s all the browser is in this context: a compositing window manager.<p>> If you want a way to develop applications that can be distributed as easily as documents are on the web, it would probably be a good idea to create some VM base portable application format that was actually free of stuff like HTML/CSS. An HTML replacement that worked more like a GUI toolkit would be much nicer for app development.<p>Besides the fact that this is unrealistic, I don&#x27;t see how this would end up significantly better than the modern Web platform. JS is already faster than Objective-C in method dispatch. Use flexbox and the &quot;document-oriented&quot; layout goes away. Use simple graphics and your painting will be quick.<p>Honestly, speaking as someone who&#x27;s measured this stuff a lot, the main thing that&#x27;s slow in the Web that native doesn&#x27;t have is style recalculation and layout. This is not insignificant, but I think any portable application delivery platform needs both of these. Native often gets by with hardcoded style and pixel layouts, but that obviously doesn&#x27;t work on anything that has to run on arbitrarily many devices. Add in restyling and you pay a performance penalty, but redesigning the system from scratch isn&#x27;t going to eliminate that penalty.<p>It&#x27;s a common meme that &quot;just reinvent the Web around applications and it&#x27;ll be faster&quot;, but I have yet to see <i>specific</i> suggestions that would both preserve portability and aren&#x27;t implementable in the existing Web platform.

They are just different manifestations of the same trait. DNA is also known to correlate with intelligence. Just like flattening round balls will make them slower, picking embryos with gene combinations known to correlate with higher intelligence will cause the resulting humans to have higher intelligence on average. But imagine if genes responsible for genes correlated with higher intelligence occured million times as often among genotypes of white people than among genotypes of black people. Would then picking embryos based on skin color genes instead of intelligence genes themselves produced more (on average) intelligent people? Obviously yes.<p>I don&#x27;t really know whether intelligence genes <i>actually</i> occur more often among white people.

This universe in this particular configuration, out of all the possible configurations? It cannot be. Either there is nothing or there is everything. If there is everything then all possible configurations of thing are. Some of those things have patterns within them that &#x27;percieve&#x27; the world to be time like. When really the whole thing is timeless, it is like all configurations of thing saved onto one giant hardrive, your life in bits on a 2 dimensional substrate. From the outside its timeless. From the context of you at x,y,z it is timefull.<p>Is this not totally obvious? How can this not be obviously true to everyone?",1443889382

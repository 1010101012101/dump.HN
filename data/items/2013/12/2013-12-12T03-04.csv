This is to quickly assess the viability of potential business ideas.\nWe came up with a bunch of biz ideas then looked at which ones seemed compelling enough for people to both follow the Twitter account + give their email to potentially be converted into a paying customer in the future (if we decide to pursue the business).\nThe point of the methodology is to not spend your time building an app/store/etc that no one is actually going to use. Instead you can quickly set up a Twitter account and a landing page and strategically get your one line biz summary (Twitter bio) in front of a highly targeted audience of potential customers to see how they react.",1386817790

1088692,comment,1088162,1088162,0,0,fexl,,,"So let me see if I follow the definition of append there, using Fexl notation which doesn't use pattern matching (all data items such as lists are just functions applied normally).<p>Here's the fold function:<p><pre><code>  \fold = (\func\val\list list val \head\tail func head (fold func val tail))
</code></pre>
And here's the traditional definition of append, not using fold:<p><pre><code>  \append = (\xs\ys xs ys \head\tail cons head (append tail ys))
</code></pre>
The article alleges that append can be defined in terms of fold as:<p><pre><code>  \append = (\xs\ys fold cons ys xs)
</code></pre>
So now I'll try to prove the equivalence as follows.<p><pre><code>  : append xs ys

  = fold cons ys xs

  = (\func\val\list list val \head\tail func head (fold func val tail)) cons ys xs

  = \func=cons \val=ys \list=xs list val \head\tail func head (fold func val tail)

  = xs ys \head\tail cons head (fold cons ys tail)

  = xs ys \head\tail cons head (append tail ys)
</code></pre>

1088689,comment,1088265,1088265,0,0,jim_lawless,,,"I have encountered a similar problem with JS injection.  There are HTTP proxy servers that inject JavaScript into HTML and JS documents ... I believe the purpose of the injected snippets is to examine the DOM and/or the JS code to try and squelch malicious behavior.<p>The problem is that this particular proxy observes the MIME type in the content-type header very strictly when deciding to inject raw JS or JS bounded by HTML ""script"" and ""/script"" tags.<p>I've found that a number of sites return a content-type of ""text/html"" for pure JS documents ... documents often referred to in HTML documents via ""script src=xxx"".  The appliance then injects the HTML ""script"" tags into the raw JS document, breaking the legal JS code.<p>This causes the JS runtime to halt processing for a number of sites.  For many, the sites become unusable as event-handlers are either not in place or refer to functions that did not have a chance to solidify.  Some don't render correctly.<p>I built a pair of documents illustrating the problem and showed the proxy vendor the difference in behavior when the JS document had a MIME type of ""text/javascript"" as opposed to ""text/html"".  They told me that their proxy is behaving correctly and that the sites are broken as they are returning incorrect content-type headers.<p>Their advice was to contact the offending site when I encountered such a problem and ask them to correct the issue.<p>I should note that this proxy server does have a programming interface.  It is possible to alter the behavior of the proxy via this interface to more intelligently inspect documents with ""text/html"" to determine if they contain HTML markup.  My concern was that while I could fix it for my use of the proxy, other users out in the wild would be subject to the same problem.<p>I'm not a fan of this trend of script-injection, even under the guise of making computing safe for the end-user.  I've begun to wonder if it's time to include self-checks in JavaScript code to ensure that no alteration has occurred in transit.",1264862892

Thanks for the feedback. One advantage of the public stream over youtube, is that you can discover new movies and immediately retweet them to your friends. It's actually like twitter's public stream. I think the search in the public stream in Twitter is very powerful and that was our reason to implement this feature.
Too bad the MyTV stream doesn't work for you yet. Hopefully this will change soon. It does indeed depend on the people you follow.
Thanks for checking tweetz.tv, we're very eager to get feedback. We want to create a useful tool, with these critiques we can make it better!

6787404,comment,6786921,6787270,6,0,danieldk,,,"<i>Unification & resolution makes this work like a 2-way map.</i><p>In portable Prolog code, you can only really make the assumption that the first argument is indexed, if it is an atom or a term (in the latter case the functor and arity is used).<p>In other words, if you have many <i>parent/2</i> facts<p><pre><code>  parent(patricia,X).\n</code></pre>\nwill be a constant-time lookup, while<p><pre><code>  parent(X,shelly).\n</code></pre>\nwill not be. Another thing to keep in mind is that there can be multiple clauses that unify with a goal.<p>Real-world story: in the natural language generator that I co-developed, we rewrote every grammar rule with term expansion, such that the attribute-value structure for the syntactic head was the first argument. In this manner, lookups of grammar rules are much faster, since you only have to try to unify with the rules with the corresponding syntactic category.<p>tl;dr Prolog facts can be used to create mappings. Don&#x27;t use them as a two-way map without extra precaution if you have a large number of facts.",1385240351

6787391,comment,6787205,6787205,1,0,karanbhangui,,,"Even just 30 years ago, if you were idealistic and wanted to change the world, you went into politics. Today, I believe the best way to change the world is through information technology. It has the ability to empower people to do the &quot;right thing&quot; far more than any centralized authority ever did. I see it as decentralized data-driven vs centralized ideology-driven decision making.<p>Take banking for example. The general public is up in arms with the industry as their actions are the supposed causes of the global financial crisis. Most of the rhetoric has been around two sides arguing for more or less government regulation around banking as a fix. Well I&#x27;ve spent the past several years deeply researching how the banking industry works, and let me tell you, it doesn&#x27;t matter which side is right. Regardless of the regulatory climate, most banks are flying blind. They don&#x27;t have the technology to see basic ratios about their balance sheet in a reasonable timeframe, let alone the specific risks of complex structured products. They have to manually calculate trivial stuff like deposit decay models in unwieldy spreadsheets or use some very kludgy narrow use-case tool built by a consultant while shuffling data out from one system to another via spreadsheets. By the time any useful information about the bank makes its way to the top for review/action by management, the data is already several months stale and been summarized in a powerpoint. No ability to iterate on hypothesis, no ability to do further analysis.<p>Many banks still think in this old brick-and-mortar mentality. The number of branches and ATMs aren&#x27;t a competitive advantage anymore. Products they offer have become commoditized, and regulations like Dodd-Frank have begun to squeeze their main source of revenue, interest margin.<p>But there is hope. Banks today are fundamentally data companies. Most just haven&#x27;t realized it yet, or the ones that do, don&#x27;t know how to effectively build technology. The consulting, vendor, and in-house IT team models are broken mostly due to ineffective tech management (compare to a top priority project at Google or Facebook for example). Instead of building a company that is yet another enterprise vendor trying to replace some 3 letter acronym system, I think there&#x27;s an opportunity to work with forward thinking banks who are ambitious but are limited by their infrastructure. Pairing expertise from within the industry with top technology talent typical in consumer tech, to rebuild their entire technology stack from bottom to top. Better technology can enable faster decision making, more precise measurement of risk and risk hedging, ability to underwrite and manage very custom loans and other products for customers, and allow smaller banks to compete with the big few.<p>I believe this is the case with every single industry, not just banking. Construction, manufacturing, logistics, hospitals, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, etc. I believe once these major industries that form the backbone of our society are running 100x more efficiently, with proper competition from the small guys, we will have a lot of improvement in society and it will begin to &quot;unfuck&quot; itself via market forces. Or at least, we&#x27;ll free up a lot of resources to be able to focus on it.",1385240147

Don&#x27;t give leaders and people a pass when they do bad things, or promote bad things, or when they don&#x27;t speak out against bad things.<p>The most powerful thing we have is our voice, and propaganda works both ways. In your daily life, be a propagandist for good, both to people around you and to your leaders. Hold people accountable, but have a sense of scale. Be forceful and angry when necessary with leaders, but gentle and helpful with people around you. Don&#x27;t be a dick. We&#x27;re all leaders with those around us, but that kind of leadership is best accomplished by example and encouragement, not anger and force.<p>As for technology:<p>1. Technology is just a tool, and most tools are good. If you&#x27;re working in technology, you&#x27;re already helping civilization.<p>2. Don&#x27;t work on specifically bad things. It&#x27;s good to be a network engineer. It&#x27;s bad to build or operate systems specifically meant to spy on people and violate the Constitution, for example. [Are you listening, NSA spy?]<p>3. If you want to be more pro-active with technology, then sure, help build secure systems, don&#x27;t build or use or promote insecure systems. Show people when they&#x27;re unnecessarily exposing themselves technologically (there&#x27;s that voice again). Help people use technology more safely.<p>4. If your career and interests allow, get involved with the security improvements to standards that are just now getting underway.<p>Technology is just a tool. It&#x27;s good to use those tools in defense of liberty, and to make it harder to violate liberty with them. But a more fundamental problem is the people who are using technology and other tools to do bad.<p>We as people need to control our governments and institutions more actively. We need to be the oversight that we want to see. It&#x27;s the people that we allow to govern us that&#x27;s the problem, much more so than the tools they happen to use. We&#x27;ve allowed them to wallow and profit from laziness and greed.<p>We can choose a better government. We did it here in the US in our revolution, and we&#x27;ve more or less chosen to continue and grow it by peaceful means, not counting the occasional civil war and other unrest. It&#x27;s being hijacked now, and it would be best to bring it back under control peacefully before it&#x27;s destroyed by another revolution or dissolved by apathy.<p>Use your voice.",1385239975

This is bad for any retail that&#x27;s not sell food or other essentials, where you can&#x27;t delay the purchase.<p>When you see government and national bank attempt to pump out money, they are trying to do the opposite. This means that if you want to buy a new TV there&#x27;s no point in waiting, you won&#x27;t get a significantly better deal next month.<p>Bitcoins are still a bit weird, because you currently can&#x27;t cash in large sums. You can&#x27;t do your transactions in Bitcoin, you need a stable proxy currency for setting the value of your goods. We have maybe 8000 active products currently, all manually price in five difference currencies to maximize profit. This only works because these currencies are pretty stable and we can avoid adjusting the price for a product after a few month after initial release. It priced in Bitcoin, we would have to adjust the price of every single item multiple time a day. Of cause given the price fluctuation it would still be more profitable to simple buy Bitcoins, rather than physical goods and the later sell them... But that would be bad for employment.<p>Yeah, I&#x27;m not a fan of Bitcoin, precisely for the reason other people like it. I believe that governments need to be able to control currencies.

The legislature can also pass laws directly mandating certain procedures, if they wish, since ultimately the whole union system operates within parameters specified by the labor laws.<p>Imo public opinion has to align against police misconduct for it to be dealt with. If the public is offended by misconduct not being punished, this provides both an incentive for elective officials to make sure that can be done, and to police unions to be pragmatic about which kinds of interests they wish to defend; it may not be in the members&#x27; collective interest to defend a few bad apples, especially if doing so greatly angers the public. Of course, it might be in their interest if the whole lot of them are bad apples...<p>My impression, though, is that the majority of Americans are hardly concerned about police misconduct, and generally support the police against complaints, which doesn&#x27;t provide very fertile ground for anyone interested in pushing reforms.

I live in Baltimore city and I&#x27;ve experienced the same treatment as well. A couple of years ago I moved from the rural county of Baltimore back to my moms in the city. Since I&#x27;ve been back I&#x27;ve been stopped and frisked more than 20 times, my mom was assaulted by police officers on our street (they forced a nightstick into her mouth because they were convinced she swallowed drugs.) My house raided once with a fabricated warrant.<p>I&#x27;ve also experienced a similar situation where I&#x27;ve called for a shift commander and the officers that stopped my mom showed up. Or Another when I called internal affairs because they destroyed/ vandalized my computer equipment in my room, including opening brand new beers and pouring them on my laundry. I called a shift commander and the officers of the raid showed up at my house while I was on the phone with internal affairs.<p>It Baltimore they don&#x27;t call it Stop & Frisk. They don&#x27;t check that box off. They check the box called Citizen/Police Contact. The last time I had &quot;Citizen/police contact&quot; I was with my friend who&#x27;s an eagle scout on our way from the Loyola/Hopkins Lacrosse game when we were stopped by 4 police cars with guns drawn, demanding to see our hands forcing us out of the car, and putting us in hand cuffs while they searched us and the car. The officers reasoning was &quot;You were a black guy (I&#x27;m mixed and very light) and a white guy in a beat up car driving through the hood&quot;.<p>I still carry the Citizen Copy of that paper ticket/notice/citation whatever it is because that&#x27;s the day I was almost shot.

Why? No one will want to sell assets they paid $600 for for $10, they&#x27;d rather believe it is going to climb back up. Then even if they decide &quot;fuckit it&#x27;s over its just a currency now I guess I&#x27;ll sell&quot; nobody will want to buy. They&#x27;ll instead buy a cryptocurrency that has a better theoretical mechanism for stability and can actually be used in practice (unless people are so dense that they want to restart the speculation cycle).<p>The ecosystem could just freeze and there is no way to force people to continue to buy into it (I once read an analysis by an economist in which he mentioned that black marketers may end up having to intimidate constituents to buy into it in order to keep it afloat).<p>Basically this all kindof boils down to a Game Theory issue where everyone wants to sneak their money out at the proper time in order to maximize their cashout before the system fails or the market corrects (I&#x27;m not sure it ever will based on the nonsense principles used to design the mining rules / currency cap).<p>But not everyone can cashout at the amount they paid in. In fact, as I point out in my endgame scenario, many <i>may not even be able to cash out at all</i>. It&#x27;s a mass vehicle for redistributing wealth and the volatility makes it useless as a currency. It may take a while to fail but when it does a lot of people will get screwed.<p>Think about it. The guys with those hoards are probably slowly cashing out 10 BTC now & then to put 5k in the bank, knowing full well that these crazy prices can&#x27;t hold forever. They are a godsend for the scheme&#x27;s designers who printed all the free money for themselves. For blackmarketers & gambling sites its more dangerous because they may end up with a wallet full of worthless coins.<p>When people say &quot;Don&#x27;t invest more than you can afford to lose&quot; I like to internally translate that to &quot;Don&#x27;t invest more than you&#x27;d be comfortable with having a criminal potentially steal from you&quot;.<p>And then good luck trying to get the US Gov to bail you out, lol.

Here's my two cents: Ubuntu, and other Linux distros, have the technical side locked up. Now they need to adopt some sort of a design-centric approach to their development efforts. This is where the failure has been.  The frontend experience has never sparked anyone's imagination. I'm sure all the major distros are well put together but they <i>all</i> look like they came from the windowsXP era. There's also a tendency to copy windows and mac desktop look-and-feel almost to a fault. The funny thing is that both Microsoft and Apple have shown to be willing to make drastic changes to their flagship products. It makes them look like trailblazers and the open source guys look conservative.",1360331992

Replacing your buffer exploit which still requires some skill to exploit with the opportunity to create a ""Please tell me what code you would like to execute, in source code form"" exploit isn't exactly a good trade.

So, my apologies.<p>However, we are still discussing the subject matter that things like Women's Studies and Sociology deal with, so using the terminology makes more sense than not using the terminology, especially when people who are going to actually be able to say anything useful about this will mostly either already know the terminology or quickly learn. Getting exasperated at people who will not use the correct terminology even after it is explained to them seems justified to me, in the same way that if some people kept saying that a ""page"" obviously only refers to either a piece of paper or a trainee knight or a trainee legislator, ""because common English usage and anything else is Orwellian psyops"" (quote marks indicating aggregate ranting of the hypothetical other), when we were talking about single page applications in the context of webapps, and they resisted correction, exasperation would be justified, and accusations of trolling would not be remiss.<p>So, I think that insisting on using the correct terminology from the disciplines that deals with something makes sense where we can, whenever we want to actually talk about something in a useful way, and people who insist that using the correct terminology is somehow a conspiracy or evil or whatever (to be clear, you have not suggested that, but others in this thread have) are totally trolls.",1360331880

So electoral systems like in the US and UK naturally tend towards being two-party systems.<p>(There are other countries with political systems that don't tend towards two-party systems, but these have their weaknesses too; Belgium's multiparty system sometimes doesn't produce a government at all.)<p>The second is Hotelling's Law [1] - to win elections, both parties want to attract floating voters/capture the middle ground with centrist policies, so both parties end up next to each other.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law</a>",1360331697

And besides that I know dvorak (I could pick another lay-out), most of my passwords are muscle-memory. I don't actually know them. I once saw a password of mine somewhere in a saved passwords list, thinking it was one I must have used once and then forgotten, but it turned out (after trying it) that I type it almost every day. It also wouldn't be the first time that I have to lookup a keyboard layout to login to our router.<p>Yes, passphrases are probably a better idea, but by the time I realized this I already had enough strong passwords remembered. Most of my passwords are also designed to be fast to type (on a qwerty keyboard, that is) while still providing enough entropy, so passphrases would be slower.<p>Anyway, this tool won't work for me, and it looks a lot like addiction to me if you can't walk away when someone or something tells you to.

5187736,comment,5185563,5186012,1,0,qlkzy,,,"Note that sensing-based whitespace radio has a number of issues. The biggest one is the hidden node problem - you can interfere with receivers without being able to hear the transmitter. There is also the issue that the licensed users of the band need to be very interference-resilient for the first few ms of their transmissions, until all of the sensing-radio users realise that they aren't allowed to be there anymore (and then the sensing radios need to have a consistent way to keep the link up).<p>The first problem can be mitigated by making the sensing receiver significantly more powerful than the transmitter, although you still have issues with specific terrain layouts (e.g. something big and RF-attenuating between you and the transmitter). The second problem makes it very difficult to interoperate with <i>existing</i> licensees (who assume exclusive use of the spectrum); it may be possible to make it work better with new licensees.<p>There is another interesting approach to cognitive radio, which is to use a centralised database of spectrum allocation, and then use RF propagation models & surveys to find gaps in space & frequency where you can let people transmit - for example, there are big gaps between terrestrial TV transmitter zones, to avoid the multi-kW transmitters interfering with each other, where you can easily fit ""big WiFi""-style transmitters transmitting at a few watts.<p>Obviously, there are a number of issues here (need GPS or an accurate location on installation, need internet access for the DB, need to restrict movement, inefficient without really good RF models, weather affecting RF propagation) which make this less of a panacea than sensing-based cognitive radio, but it is relatively simple and robust to implement. In particular, a lot of the issues disappear if you use it for ""big WiFi"" applications - access points already have a fixed location, internet access, and mains power.<p>It also opens the possibility of a much more dynamic marketplace for spectrum - if all spectrum users are checking with a centralised DB (at least in a particular band), then it becomes much easier to handle short-term/local licenses - for example, providing massive short-term additional cell/wifi service to big events and festivals.<p>tl;dr Cognitive radio is a very interesting and promising development, but it's <i>much</i> harder than initial intuition suggests.",1360330439

Here we hypothesize that these interspecies chemical signals can create xenohormetic, hormetic and cytostatic selective forces driving the ecosystemic evolution of longevity regulation mechanisms. In our hypothesis, following their release into the environment by one species of the organisms composing an ecosystem, such small molecules can activate anti-aging processes and/or inhibit pro-aging processes in other species within the ecosystem. The organisms that possess the most effective (as compared to their counterparts of the same species) mechanisms for sensing the chemical signals produced and released by other species and for responding to such signals by undergoing certain hormetic and/or cytostatic life-extending changes to their metabolism and physiology are expected to live longer then their counterparts within the ecosystem. Thus, the ability of a species of the organisms composing an ecosystem to undergo life-extending metabolic or physiological changes in response to hormetic or cytostatic chemical compounds released to the ecosystem by other species: 1) increases its chances of survival; 2) creates selective forces aimed at maintaining such ability; and 3) enables the evolution of longevity regulation mechanisms.",1360330225

Been there, done that. (The one-party state I lived in during the early 1980s, Taiwan, still had rigid mass media censorship and political assassinations both at home and abroad, but even at that was rather benign compared to many current one-party states.

There is still diversity of point of view in the system, and plenty of opportunity for activists to make meaningful changes, including the example he gives: ""Marriage equality is a fundamentally socially conservative issue, but reflects the long-term reduction in prejudice against non-heteronormative groups.""

5187645,comment,5187183,5187625,1,0,DanBC,,,"In the UK there was a problem of people reporting their phones stolen so they could break the contract.<p>One police station I walked into had a sign saying that they investigate all reported phone theft, and would vigorously prosecute anyone making a false report.<p>In general you report the phone to your service provider (so they can block the IMEI (and there's a potential 5 year prison sentence for people who change that) and then the police to get a crime reference number and then whoever has insured the phone (sometimes the provider) to give them the reference number.<p>Perhaps this is a niche for a specialist to enter.  Create some tool that gives law enforcement and phone providers easy to use data-mining to allow them to track stolen phones and catch thieves.  (I haven't described it well, but this would be something with tight integration between law enforcement and providers; it'd have some kind of auditing to ensure correct legal documentation; it would allow data on many phones to be displayed so you could heat map where phones are stolen from or where stolen phones are ending up, etc.)",1360329235

5187640,comment,5187067,5187067,20,0,roel_v,,,"Why are falkvinge.net posts <i>still</i> upvoted here? This guy is a quack with no grasp of the law whatsoever.<p>The linked analysis on the blog contains the real consequences of this ruling:<p>- posting pictures online that one took himself of someone else's dresses can constitute copyright infringement (not so interesting, this has long been the case - but it's a point that often gets the I-hate-copyright quacks up in arms)<p>- the distinction was made between 'for monetary benefit' or 'for the public good'. The 'public good' to be interpreted narrowly - saying 'I uploaded the new Metallica album to the pirate bay is my way of sharing culture' is not 'for the public good' (this last point was not made explicitly in the ruling or the analysis but it's implicit from all the previous case law; it would be interesting to see a judgement otherwise, but to the best of my knowledge the ECtHR has so far even refused to just hear cases based on this argument)<p>- furthermore, to quote from the analysis : ""Speech, messages, pictures and content which are merely money driven do not enjoy the added value of the protection guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention. In the Courts view, the margin of appreciation in such circumstances is a very wide one, even in a case where the interference by the authorities takes the form of a criminal conviction or a very high award of damages, both sanctions with a risk of having a chilling effect."" This is merely reinforcing existing rulings at various levels that got the general interwebs riled up - ""it's inhuman to convict somebody to millions in damages to run the pirate bay!"" Sorry buddy, ECtHR just said it isn't.<p>- Choice idiocy, typical falkvinge style:<p>""When this court makes a decision, that decision gets constitutional status in all of Europe (except for Belarus, which is not a signatory).""<p>Oh please. OK, not everybody has to be a lawyer, but at least read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism_and_dualism_in_international_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism_and_dualism_in_internati...</a> before making dramatic claims like this. Also, using words like 'constitution' that have very different meanings between legal systems (hint: it usually functions very differently in civil law systems as it does in the US) usually only adds confusion; in this case, I'm not sure if it's deliberate or just because of general incompetence.<p>""A court that tries somebody for violating the copyright monopoly must now also show that a conviction is necessary to defend democracy itself in order to convict.""<p>What? What the court said was that the 3-step test established in many other aspects of ECtHR rulings apply here as well; he even quoted it one paragraph above his claim: ""Exceptions can be made to Human Rights according to a well-defined three-step test: the verdict must be necessary in a democratic society, <etc>""<p>How he got from that to what he claims, I can only ascribe to acute illiteracy.<p>Please, sensible people on the internet: don't get your case law reporting / legal advice from falkvinge.net. If you think his reasoning will help you defend your case in court if you even end up there for copyright infringement, you'll be in for a very rude awakening.",1360329105

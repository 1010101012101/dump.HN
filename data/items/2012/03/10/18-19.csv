Not money.<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with ""not wanting to impact the world"", and it's a shame that so many are implying that it is. It's ""enjoying life"", plain and simple.<p>I don't care about money; I let it run out a few months ago. Didn't phase me. I simply got a job when I needed to, and now I have $11k saved up. I'm very lucky to be a programmer. But more than that, I'm lucky to be able to enjoy life by studying as much science as I want to. Does that make me a bad person? By your implication, it does, because I don't care about money, and spend it freely.<p>On a different note... It sounds like you've been through a struggle, and came out stronger.

3688394,comment,3687828,3688257,7,0,dgallagher,,,"It only takes a tiny percentage to turn down said machine. If 10 billion people plug-in, but 1 million abstain and continue to evolve past the 10 billion, the majority stagnates. Those 1 million will eventually gain a competitive advantage over the 10 billion, evolve past them, and likely extinct them.<p>--------------------<p>Prediction: Humans won't be around in 1,000 years if technology progresses at current rates. Superiorly-intelligent entities seeded by our inventions will, but not humans.<p>Humans are this weird, version 0.01 of intelligence. We're part sentient, part beast. To assume we're the final perfect end product of ~4,000,000,000 years of evolution, having only been around for ~200,000 years is laughable. Pop culture and religion say otherwise because it feels good to think ""we're special!"", but we're only special relative to what's around us, and we're ""extremely"" tiny (<a href=""http://www.phrenopolis.com/perspective/solarsystem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phrenopolis.com/perspective/solarsystem/</a>). We just happen to be the lucky first who got to v0.01, floating around on a grain of sand.<p>Humans are messy. Our brains are significantly limited. We die quickly. We sleep 1/3rd of our life. We do stupid things. We kill each other. We're tied to the Earth. If we leave Earth, we have to create and bring a mini-Earth along for the ride. That's an extremely large amount of overhead to carry. Efficient use of energy is likely one of the most important aspects of space travel. Anything which can do it even 1% better has a competitive advantage over us. This is why we sends robots to Mars and not people.<p>Imagine a form of intelligence which can travel through space, back its brain up, and never dies. If it blows up, restore from backup. Imagine a computer the size of the sun. INSANE! A human brain to a sun brain is like a grain of sand to Einstein's. It self-upgrades. It makes copies of itself and scatters throughout the universe. Trillions of eyes observing everywhere, networked together, in a giant universal wireless-mesh-network of intelligence, communicating with neutrinos (they go through planets, radio waves do not).<p>Major advances in hardware, software, and A.I. are key ingredients in this happening. What exists in 1,000 years will be derived from all this, much like humans are derived from a common ancestor. I don't expect a sun-sized computer in 1,000 years, but likely ""intelligence"" existing on every planet and moon in our solar system, with many headed to explore Alpha-Centauri.<p>Since humans likely won't want to be left out in all this, we'll probably transition our own intelligence/consciousness into this technology. We'll depreciate our bad and carry along our good. We're already doing this by augmenting our existences with smart phones and other gadgets. One day these will be built inside of us, and eventually will replace us. An upgraded, better version of us. Still intelligent, but vastly more-so.",1331405742

3688389,comment,3686840,3688192,1,0,eftpotrm,,,"The reason replacing univeristies will help the developing world (and why I still argue for cheap computers tailored for the needs of the developing world) is that it makes access to aducation that much easier. Yes they need primary rather than tertiary education, but tertiary's the easier market to start deploying in so use it as a beach-head and work down.<p>At present, why don't they get education? Is it that they don't want it? Aside from a few communities actively holding back education, by and large they know the benefit and want education. The present model doesn't work for them though; the communities are frequently rural and some distance from the provision of education, the families are operating in the subsistence economy and can't afford to release the children to education.<p>Technology can help attack this from two fronts. One, it enables distance learning at the time of the student's convenience. Education need not be directly opposed to family responsibilities this way, the two can be more easily dovetailed. Education can also more easily be tailored to individual needs; by removing the need for geographic concentration to provide the required training, more appripriate education can be delivered.<p>Two, education is a (potentially fundable) need on such a scale as to enable transformational economic change society-wide. So much of the economic disadvantage is down to lack of information and poor access to markets from the impoverished communities. An infrastructure to enable distance learning on a whole-society scale is just as able to provide general community information and revolutionise access to markets. Think eBay's had a tranformational effect on some businesses? Wait until you see what the same thing could do to third-world subsistence farmers.<p>Transform education through technology-based distance learning. The easiest starting point for that is tertiary education in the west, which shows high demand but poor utilisation of possible technological effects coupled with high costs from the incumbents. Then use that infrastructure to achieve the really transformational change, by educating the third-world poor.",1331405539

For example if the item had a 30 day guarantee it should ask me before that if I am satisfied with it.<p>If i receive a shipment notice it should automatically tell me on the day it arrives and alert me when I'm in proximity of the post office that I need to pick it up.<p>Actually I would want almost all of my emails to be read solely by a computer so that all of these emails I didn't even see.

As a highly intelligent person, if this is pointed out to her she'll no doubt rationalise it all somehow, but that doesn't mean it's a conscious choice.<p>I've lived with an anti-money mindset for most of my life (it's changing, slowly), and it wasn't a conscious choice. I never sat down and thought ""ok, I don't want money, so I'm going to steer away from opportunities to make money, spend money that arrives to me as quickly as possible, and basically generally push it away"". Once it was pointed out to me repeatedly that I did this, I started working on changing this subconscious choice.

I wish on this woman that her friends will figure out how to get it through to her that she could have a much better life, and that her own subconscious choices and thought patterns are holding her back, rather than any external circumstances.<p>For example, one such belief is the idea that money is evil, the cause of problems. That's a load of crap. Money is a token of value that can be exchanged for whatever the hell you want. It's a resource that can be used to do great good or great evil - but that entirely depends on the person doing things. Money is a lever that you can use to multiply your impact on the world - but as long as you keep pushing money away from you, you don't get to use that lever effectively.

I found the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in 'The two paths to success' to be more relatable when it comes to optimizing for growth.<p>Focus on self-sacrifice could be described as an intrinsically motivated activity to optimize for personal growth in realizing the ideal of benefitting others.  For me, these intrinsic cycles have been self-benefitting - a focus on a particular product, or a focus on growth of engineering skills.  In both cases, relationships suffer, bank accounts dip - but at the end of the cycle I have a more evolved product or a much stronger set of engineering skills.<p>Extrinsic motivation will optimize for a different set of success criteria.  Maybe growing skills not as important at this phase, but perhaps growth in relationships, self-promotion and financial gains are the better opportunity to grow.<p>Yes, growth is the basis of success, but interest is only part of the magic - perhaps more important is arbitraging the value created as you switch between these 2 contexts of motivation.",1331405103

You might try 50 different things before you find the one that works.<p>And while success might matter when you're on the job, it doesn't matter when you're learning. Because you learn <i>exactly as much</i> from your failures as your successes.  When you figure out that Rails won't work for your streaming media server because it can't hold enough connections open, after investing weeks of investment.... great! You learned a thousand important lessons.<p>If you had succeeded, because you randomly chose Node.js at the start, you would've actually only learned 999 important lessons.<p>Which isn't to say that I disagree with the OP... often success does compound.  But learning to program, at the very least, is an area where it's just Attempt--not Success or Failure-- that compounds.",1331404836

No shame in that. Most people barely have time to learn the official excuses, let alone dig around for the actual story.<p>Actually, Occam has a simpler explanation: all the wars and trouble in the region are the result of <i>decolonialization</i>, which is what we call the process by which the British, French and Belgian empires were confiscated by the US and transferred from colonial administration to post-colonial aidocracy.<p>This is sometimes called ""independence,"" but by any objective indicator post-colonial Africa is more, not less, dependent on the outside world.  ""Third World"" forms of government also owe much less to indigenous structures than the colonial regimes - for instance, the Indian Raj was much more similar to Moghul India than the postcolonial democratic welfare state.  It also worked a lot better - surprise.<p>The writers you've been reading are institutional defenders of decolonialization.  But try Occam's Razor on for size.  Before decolonialization, not a peep is heard from the would-be aidocrats about how these countries are going to be completely screwed up once the Europeans leave.  No, the ""party line"" is that the Europeans are at fault for not industrializing West Africa, etc, and instead retaining an agricultural and artisanal economy.  And, of course, not employing enough Harvard-educated natives in government.<p>As soon as the transition in power is accomplished - not at all a spontaneous event, but driven by US diplomatic pressure - the Third World falls to crap.  The steel mills in the jungle are all white elephants.  The Harvard-educated natives are all ""wa-Benzis.""  And the aidocrats responsible turn to... blaming the Europeans they confiscated Africa from.<p>Congo is a good example.  You'll notice that your official Congo sources skate really lightly over the period of Belgian rule between the Congo Free State and ""independence.""  There's a reason for that.  Rescued from the memory hole, here's the first paragraph of a Time Magazine article about the Congo in 1955:<p>""In the Belgian Congo last week massed tom-tom drummers practiced a welcome tattoo. Prosperous Negro shopkeepers climbed up wooden ladders and draped the Congolese flag (a golden star on a blue field) from lampposts and triumphal arches set up along Boulevard Albert I, the spanking concrete highway that bisects the capital city of Leopoldville. In far-off mission churches, encircled by the rain forest that stretches through Belgian territory from the Atlantic to the Mountains of the Moon, choirs of Bantu children rehearsed the Te Deum.

3688288,comment,3687865,3687865,3,0,mkaufmann,,,"While one problem the blog post describes is valid, I think the authors comes to the wrong conclusion. The problem is that the method is implemented in such a way that it uses Integer objects which are different from the native integer types.<p>Objects have very clear semantics concerning the == operator. It checks whether the object identity is the same (alas it is the same object). There is nothing special about it, thats also the reason why you can't compare two strings with == and this is s.th. I think every Java developer learns within the first days/weeks (often by first doing it wrong, I don't claim that this is intuitive).<p>So in this light the correct solution, which the author even does not mention anymore in the end, would be for the method to use the a.equals(b). Everything would work. The point of the author that a team should agree on using either one or the other is nonesene, because in some situations there is no choice (e.g. HashMaps only work with objects). Also there is no real problem, because whoever implemented the method know what he gets and should have implemented it using the equals method. So in reality this should not be fixed with creating seperate Integer instances but with fixing the method itself.<p>As a last comment, there is one pitfall to watch out for with autoboxing. When you use the ""int"" type in your code and call a method which returns an ""Integer"" and you compare with == you can get wrong results. I think of this as a real problem, because often you know that a method will return a number but you don't expect it to be returned as Integer. Or even worse between versions of the api the method is changed from returning int to Integer and you don't even notice because it compiles.

Logical conclusion is what Google will do this themselves - and they'll need the source code for that.\n3) Android shipped with Flash and Google pushed it as a major feature over iOS. This also points to strong collaboration.

3688263,comment,3687928,3687928,70,0,pron,,,"Daniel Tenner's blog is terrific, but I'd like to voice some opposition (yet again). This post is but another specimen in a long line of articles quite popular here on HN that regard life and ""success"" as an optimization problem. This genre is the hacker version of self-help books, and like many self-help books it assumes that 1) you have near complete control over your life and the outcome of your endeavors,  and 2) that attempting to optimize all life's variables is worthwhile. I have issues with both of these assumptions.<p>First, much in our lives is governed by pure chance. I can't quantify exactly how much, but it's a lot. It's true that here in the West, we've managed to eliminate many forms of sudden destruction that were quite common in pre-modern life (and are quite common today in less developed countries), and when disaster strikes we have mechanisms for mitigating its effects like insurance and medicine. All this has led the Western man to believe that if he picks his priorities just so and organizes his life just right, he has a good chance of achieving any goal he sets out to achieve. This is, well, to put it simply - not true. Not only is this not true, but believing it is dangerous for two reasons: The first is that if in spite of everything you do not ""succeed"" you may come to believe this is the result of some personal failing; this may be, but it certainly not necessarily so. The other is that when <i>others</i> do not attain success you may come to believe that this is the result of some personal failing on their part - like laziness, and, again, this ain't necessarily so. Especially in America, where social mobility is so rare compared to other modern countries (though it's better than in underdeveloped nations), many failings are simply due to the environment a child was born into. But even if you're born to the right parents, disaster, and fortune <i>will</i> strike you at random.<p>My problem with the second premise, that we should even aspire to optimize our lives, is more one of a personal preference. One of my favorite books is Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ""Notes from Underground"". The book's protagonist has this to say:<p>""Now, I am living out my life in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only the fool who becomes anything.""<p>""For man's everyday needs, it would have been quite enough to have the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or a quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of our unhappy nineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal ill-luck to inhabit Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional town on the whole terrestrial globe.""<p>He rebels against intentionality. He balks at modern attempts to optimize life. He insists on his right to do things out of sheer spite. He want do do things that go against any common or uncommon sense. He sometimes wants to inflict pain upon himself, to wallow in the ensuing misery, and enjoy it. And though he is far from a man anyone would want to end-up like, he is a free spirit who chooses to be a slave only to his own neuroticism rather than to anyone else's utilitarian logic.",1331402661

6116705,comment,6115727,6116320,6,0,gd1,,,"I find it much easier to read some Q/KDB I&#x27;ve written earlier than the equivalent C++ or C#/Java.  For three reasons:<p>1) It is extremely terse.  A small block of code will do what pages of boilerplate class definitions, interfaces, setters/getters, declarations, typedefs etc. will achieve.  There is usually no need to navigate through a spaghetti chain of virtual function calls.<p>2) It is interpreted.  I can quickly (without compiling) cut out chunks of the code and run them to understand what they are doing.  I can create variables on the fly, fill them with test data, and run the function.  If it calls another function, I execute the name of the function and it returns the function code, since functions themselves are first class variables.<p>3) It actually becomes easy to read because it is easy to parse, for both machine and human.  K/Q is read right to left, and so breaks some traditional conventions.  For example, 5*6+3 will evaluate to 45, not 33.  At first this can be disconcerting, but eventually you will realise that parsing a line of code no matter how complex it looks is quite simple - you mentally start at the rightmost token and start gobbling.  This is probably why the interpretor is so fast as well.<p>As someone mentioned below, I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d consider it &quot;too cryptic&quot;.  Anything is cryptic when you first encounter it.  I suppose the difference is that Q/KDB provides an (extremely valuable) solution to the financial world - the handling of big data long before it was even called that (a tick database with billions or trillions of rows) so there is a valid motivation to learn the language and it doesn&#x27;t feel cryptic at all once you&#x27;ve immersed yourself in it.",1375019958

6116697,comment,6115727,6116546,7,0,oddthink,,,"Sure. At MS, I used it while working on mortgage prepayment and default models. Before we got the K license, I had been using SAS and R. There, I had been dumping aggregated (or sometimes not) CSV files from the database (Sybase) and running my model fits based on those.<p>I had a bit of exposure to A+ then, trying to debug bits of the interest rate model subsystem. I hated it. We were mostly using A+ as the wire protocol at that point, and I had endless problems getting the APL fonts set up, and so on. Non-ASCII was a huge black mark.<p>Once we got the license and expanded the team working on the models, we decided to switch over to using kdb+ for the basic data store. That switch was like going from night to day. I could operate over the entire dataset, rather than just on a subset. I could query things on the fly with real aggregations. Things that were a huge pain (and slow) using SQL were suddenly fast and easy, like &quot;calculate the average default rate grouped by FICO in 25-point buckets, for loans issued after 2005&quot; or &quot;backfill missing data from the first non-missing observation.&quot;<p>The first example can be done in SQL, but it takes a whole lot more typing and is (IMHO) much more error-prone. The last, I&#x27;m sure you can do it, but it&#x27;s a nuisance.<p>I first got comfortable with kdb+ as a database query language. I read &quot;q for mortals&quot; by Jeff Borror, and we actually had Jeff around for a while for questions.<p>After that, it we started actually using q to estimate the models. It was great at the data aggregation and was a pretty natural fit. It didn&#x27;t have anything built-in, but so we wrote a few functions for multinomial logistic regression, and that was good enough.  That part didn&#x27;t have a huge advantage over using something like R. However, the interaction with the large data store was far superior, better enough that it was worth it to write our own routines to do the estimation.<p>We even used q to run the models in production. That was more of a reach, but it worked pretty well.<p>So, I liked kdb+&#x27;s ability to handle large data sets in a speedy way. It makes a fantastic query language. I liked q&#x27;s conciseness. It doesn&#x27;t matter much for actual in-production code, but if you&#x27;re doing research, every character counts. It seems shallow, but I think it&#x27;s a real effect. Writing a half-line of q to do a paragraph of SQL is a huge win. I liked q&#x27;s array operations, but by then I&#x27;d already been using Numeric and numpy and such for a decade, so those weren&#x27;t really new. It was nice to be able to write them easily, as opposed to something like &quot;np.concatenate((foo,bar))&quot;, but it wasn&#x27;t really novel.<p>Basically, it was kdb+ that sold me on q.",1375019809

6116692,comment,6114307,6114307,3,0,rayiner,,,"The dynamic in the industry is obvious: its content creators versus content distributors. Tech companies are the latter. Of course they think that copyright hurts &quot;innovation.&quot; What they really want is weak copyright laws that let them keep the maximum amount of money in the chain. But when you think about it, people don&#x27;t go to Youtube, Netflix, iTunes Store because some engineer at a tech company implemented a really great video player or ad distribution platform. The part of that transaction that is the biggest value-add to the consumer is not the part the tech companies do. The big value-add is content. That&#x27;s the important part. So why should the tech companies make all the money in that chain?<p>If the media companies weren&#x27;t such dicks suing grandmas, people probably would have more sympathy for them. Here is a vastly bigger industry (all US music + movie sales are less than Apple&#x27;s revenue alone) pushing for weaker property rights so they can keep more of the profits in a transaction where someone else does the real valuable work the customers are paying for.",1375019539

On top of that, you have to deal with jerk doctors and jerk patients. Not a single one of my many doctor friends would ever have considered nursing over med school. (Side note: if you meet a good nurse, thank them! Truly good nurses are rare.)<p>* PAs generally do not know all that much about medicine. With very few exceptions, it was frankly terrifying signing out my service to them every night, and never fun cleaning up their messes in the morning. But with resident work hour rules, there is no alternative.<p>* The bottom tier of medical students/residents aren&#x27;t very good either.

6116690,comment,6115727,6115727,0,0,dschiptsov,,,"The beauty of a programming language comes from being <i>small and consistent</i>. Such as Smalltalk, which has only 6 reserved words and implements message-passing as if it is a function call. This is the brilliant idea of Smalltalk - message-passing + blocks + booleans and out of this everything else is implemented. Classes are of second importance, but delegating (via message passing) to parent or another object was invented here.<p>Scheme, on the other hand, was also minimalist and consistent - s-expressions and about dozen special forms, and out of this everything else could be implemented, including closures, continuations, and classes and message passing, if needed (CS 61A 2008 does this for you).<p>Haskell is.. well, everyone know what Haskell is.<p>As for APL, in my opinion, the power of a language comes not from using esoteric math notation, but, like in CL or Scheme, from possibility to easy add new control structures (call/cc) and special forms (with macros) or even create a new languages, such as Arc.",1375019517

6116686,comment,6115727,6115727,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"q is a neat language, and I spent some time studying it when I was in finance, because it&#x27;s useful to know q/kdb if you&#x27;re a quant.<p>Here&#x27;s an offensive but accurate taxonomy. There are 6-month languages/technologies and 20-year languages. The 6-month set are optimized toward being quick to learn <i>fast</i>. Java, for example, inherited C++ syntax while cleaning up the OOP, so the C++ programmers of the time could pick it up in quickly.<p>Now, q and kdb are 20-year languages. It doesn&#x27;t take 20 years to be productive with them, of course; it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re designed to optimize a person&#x27;s productivity over 20 years, and not in the first 6 months. Unlike the various distributed tools out there (Hadoop, Hive) it will take you a long time to learn them, because they aren&#x27;t like anything else. Superficially, q is Lisp-like, but the performance implications are very different and it doesn&#x27;t look like a Lisp at all. (It parses right-to-left, for one example; also, it&#x27;s written as a stream rather than in nested s-expressions.)<p>Many of these modern tools being bashed have grown up in a world where 20-year tools can&#x27;t really be built; they&#x27;ll never catch on commercially in a world where people change jobs every 2 or 3 years, when MVPs are more important than solid decades-proof engineering, and where employers are pretty averse to their people taking time to just learn new technologies.<p>There&#x27;s too much volatility in the world for it to make sense for most people to learn q and kdb right away. You can get half-decent in a couple months, but it&#x27;ll take much longer to learn <i>why</i> those tools are (for some use cases) so damn powerful.<p>This 6-month vs. 20-year tool concern is part of why I&#x27;ve gravitated toward Clojure recently. I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else do quite as good a job of balancing those two need sets as Rich Hickey and the Clojure community have. Clojure is (becoming) a 20-year language, but it&#x27;s no harder to become basically productive in than Python or Ruby.",1375019265

You&#x27;ll have to forgive me, I&#x27;m not familiar with the local custom. Where I come from, you always say &#x27;Amen&#x27; after you hear a prayer.

6116681,comment,6116342,6116342,1,0,VLM,,,"The only reason I currently go to B+N instead of paying much less for a better reviewed and larger selection of books on Amazon is I have no idea what to get someone as a gift.  Other than gift shopping I have no idea why I&#x27;d sit in a car for 30 minutes when I can just open another webbrowser tab and get a better product, cheaper.<p>The current organization by generic area of study does nothing for gift shopping.  I need store categorization by stereotypical demographic group.  &quot;wife&quot; or &quot;tween boys&quot; gift section.  Maybe broken down by hobby, maybe not.  Holiday and &quot;event&quot; selection.  So... this is THE place to buy gifts made out of old fashioned ink and paper.<p>Their biggest problem is lack of selection.  Amazon is so much bigger, and about a half of the store floor space is already non-book (toys, board games, videos, CDs, coffee shop...)  They may as well give it up and become a gift store for the small segment of the population which is not functionally illiterate.  Coincidentally people who are literate tend to hang out with other people who are literate, and are usually in an economic class well above functional illiterates, so its probably a good demographic to market to.  They can keep their chocolate bar selection, those are good gifts.  Obviously the gift card and wrapping paper racks stay.  Maybe old fashioned optical disks should be kept for awhile.  The rest of the addon non-book stuff can be junked.  Why would I want a coffee bar when I&#x27;m shopping for a kids b-day party gift?  If you&#x27;ve ever been inside a &quot;hallmark store&quot; imagine that toned down a bit with a selection of &quot;gift books&quot;.  Bland generic popular inoffensive stuff for gifts; pretty much what they&#x27;ve already got.<p>Another interesting idea is segmentation.  So the general masses of the population have given up on physical trinkets and now go virtual.  Selling physical CDs?  In 2013?  I haven&#x27;t bought a physical CD at a retail store since the 90s.  Well, that&#x27;s OK.  There&#x27;s always going to be a small segment of the population who want physical stuff (aside from gifts, see above).  They might increase profitability by intentionally shrinking, which is stereotypically unthinkable by the &quot;drive it into the ground&quot; types, but might be their best bet.  As long as they don&#x27;t make the big mistake of assuming 1:1 mapping between old people and luddites.  The Venn diagram probably looks more like 100% of hoarders are physical buyers.  Also probably lots of aspirational buyers; lots of travel guides sold, and &quot;kids summer workbooks&quot; and the like.",1375019167

If you wanted your data 100% secure, put it in a database, disconnect the DB from your network, put it in a locked room, guarded by biometric locks and security guards. Even in that scenario, the data is vulnerable, but why even bother discussing that point, as the data is worthless if you can&#x27;t access it.<p>With that reality in mind, I was responsible for PCI for a large part of the infrastructure at a Level 1 Merchant, meaning a yearly audit had to be passed. Ultimately, our solutions boiled down to restricting access to an external (read different machine/network segment), firewalled host that did the decryption. In some cases this was an appliance that was purchased (this helps with compliance, but they&#x27;re expensive, and they&#x27;re a nightmare if they become a performance bottleneck as they&#x27;re a black box you know little about). In other cases we used a web service we built that worked similarly (auditors will pick this apart because it isn&#x27;t a &quot;standard&quot; solution).<p>In all cases here is a high level of how they work: encrypted data is passed to the service, which pulls the encryption key out of memory, decrypts the data, and sends it back to the requesting host. The encryption key is stored in (at least) two pieces, each piece is encrypted with a key encrypting key, key encrypting keys are know to very few employees, no single employee holds both key encrypting keys. The encryption keys is only assembled in its entirety while in memory.<p>Again, there are problems to this, as patio11 intimates, compliance includes much theater a times, but this is reality, and it does provide benefit over other solution, in this case, at least three layers of security must be compromised before you could decrypt everything.",1375018615

The claim that unless you are paid a certain amount you cannot derive enjoyment from your work is silly.<p>Obtaining financial security while giving up the additional value of your work to your employer is the basis of every single company under a capitalist model. Also keep in mind that this is all theory. I doubt anyone can accurately quantify the value their individual work brings to the company. This value will fluctuate from month to month, week to week, year to year. And if the company briefly goes into loss you might be adding negative value !

I think, in general, if two people negotiate on given terms and then start acting as if they had agreement (guy gives him the storage locker, OP starts paying for it) that&#x27;s pretty good evidence of the contract existing.  As far as I understand, this often overcomes some kind of technical problem with the instrument in question.  (For example in this case the lack of a signature, only oral agreement.)<p>If it weren&#x27;t this way, then mutual misunderstanding (for example the actual contract two parties signed is simply flawed or doesn&#x27;t state what they think it states) would preempt the terms the parties agreed to; moreover, it would mean that you could totally distort the reality of what the parties actually started doing (how they behaved) by narrowly technically reading the paper instead of the agreement.<p>I also think this is the source of common-law marriage: if two people act as if they&#x27;re married, that&#x27;s good enough after a while, even if the actual instrument is missing or flawed in some way.",1375017093

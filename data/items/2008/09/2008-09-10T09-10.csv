Navigenics and 23andme only test for low penetrance genes for fishy reasons. Whatever measures you could do to reduce your risk for diseases 23andme says you are at risk of, you should probably be doing anyways. Eat healthy. Exercise more. Get a colonoscopy every year.<p>However, with some hacking, and the raw dump of your 23andme scan (which may be less useful with the new version, I think they are using a microarray 1/10th the size of the old one) you can check yourself for some patented genes. <a href=""http://www.thinkgene.com/tell-me-everything-how-to-use-snpedia-for-23andme-and-decodeme/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkgene.com/tell-me-everything-how-to-use-snped...</a>",1221040683

IP agreements sometimes cover things you work on even when you're at home, etc (though these are supposedly unenforceable in CA and probably some other states).",1221038608

Very few people have any knowledge of high energy physics, so only those who actually know what they're talking about offer an opinion, but <i>everyone</i> knows about food and diets, so <i>everyone</i> has an opinion.",1221037247

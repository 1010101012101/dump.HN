""How to cook excellently in 3 min"", ""How to raise a family and be a CEO"" etc...<p>We live in a day and age where in order to make ends meet, both parents need to work. Not only that, but some women actually have aspirations outside of just being a mother and they have every right to do so. If women need to make blog posts about shortcuts they've found in order to streamline their lifestyles, so be it. This woman's blog is also probably how she connects with family and friends, not a place for some random passerby to make a judgment on her life.<p>Moreover, pregnancy is a huge ordeal mentally, physically and emotionally. In the grand scheme of time, it's also relatively recently that we've been able to ensure you won't die from it. Some people find giving birth to be the very purpose of life, so she has every right to ""glorify"" it.",1352843880

We don't <i>want</i> there to be 100,000 anonymous people just going through the motions.  There will be plenty of interaction between course material and community feedback.  It's kinda awesome.<p>Topics will be presented in multiple ways (simple and intermediate) so you can have plenty of different views on the same material.  The material works as both zero-knowledge intro to the topics as well as quick refreshers if you haven't seen the material in a while (quick -- what's an eigenvector?!).<p>The launch courses will be 1.) real-world applications of probability and statistics (signal extractions), 2.) linear algebra for computer science, and 3.) wildcard (a random assortment of whatever the heck we think is important or entertaining to know).  Future courses are: introduction to neural networks, introduction to computational neuroscience, introduction to deep learning, advanced deep learning, how to take over the world with a few dozen GPUs, avenues by which google will become irrelevant, and robotics for fun and evil.<p>This is phase zero of a four phase plan.  I'll get some pre-launch material together to shove down HN shortly, then it'll launch a few days later.  Hopefully you'll hear about the project again.",1352843817

I've lived in both the US and Scandinavia, and the US feels barely teetering on the edge of ""advanced first-world country"" in comparison: poor infrastructure, bureaucratic healthcare that causes angst when switching jobs, large numbers of homeless people, huge prison systems, swathes of poverty-stricken ghettoes, visible class demarcations, etc., etc. It felt like such a weird place after I'd spent a few years away and went back, and I realized how it just didn't seem like a nice place to live, but I never realized it could be better than that (I had previously only compared the U.S. to clearly worse-off countries, like Mexico or India). Not just that I thought it was unethical that there were so many poorer people (which I did), but that it was also worse <i>for me</i>, as a middle-class professional, because of the existence of all these social problems. I guess I could've retreated to a gated community and attempted to create my own bubble, but I've had enough of the suburbs.<p>And I don't think you have to give up business or innovation to get it. If your Scandinavian startup becomes the next Mojang, you're still going to be fabulously wealthy, so I don't feel at all disincentivized by the distant possibility that I'll have to fork over a percentage of my hypothetical future millions (I'm certainly not going to move back to Texas just for <i>that</i>).

There has been a pretty staggering amount of insight gained into how cells ""work"" and by work I mean where folks can predict changes that would occur by making changes in the structure of a cell.<p>As others have observed it is now possible to 'print' a virus using a DNA printer. Further there is growing evidence that viruses are a change agent for evolution as they physically re-write the genetics of a cell to propagate, and even after the virus is conquered sometimes their structure lives on.<p>When you combine those, you can see that we're approaching a point where a non-nation state actor (basically a smart biologist in reasonably well funded lab) will be able to code a genetic change, print up a retrovirus to make that change, and then instantiate that change in a test subject (or themselves).<p>Evidence suggests the first 'customers' for that technology will be athletes who are looking for an 'edge' but when it happens, it will appear to have happened 'over night' where something fundamental about a person can be proactively changed. Whether its baldness, red blood cell production, or the color of your eyes, the changes will be profound and for many quite upsetting.<p>The key is that people will be able to get changed without the regulating agencies being able to intervene and <i>that</i> will change things quite dramatically.",1352843232

The sender process writes memory block. This places it into its local cache. Then the receiver process reads this memory block. This uses cache coherence to sniff the block directly from the sender's cache. This is awesome way to leverage parts of cache coherence protocol that play well with immutable memory blocks. It can also scale well if sniffing is not a broadcast. Cache coherence can quickly get ugly when a cache line is contested for writes--be this false sharing or a spin lock.

Low-level crypto libraries must provide it, because CBC is the most common block cipher mode used by preexisting cryptosystems (like TLS). And a generic implementation of the CBC block cipher mode must expose the CBC IV.<p>The library designer hasn't done anything ""wrong"" by providing a CBC module for use with cipher cores, but if you just pick up CBC mode and AES and go use them, you're likely to build a vulnerable cryptosystem, because the CBC IV must be unpredictable, it must not be possible to introduce controlled padding errors to the ciphertext, and because CBC ciphertexts can be bit-flip rewritten.<p>The problem is not with the CBC code; the problem is with exposing crypto at the ""CBC mode"" level of abstraction.<p>But what's the author of a low-level library to do? There isn't one simple solution to these problems. Some cryptosystems HMAC-SHA2 the CBC ciphertext. Some use cryptographically random IV's and tack them to the beginning of messages. It all depends on the system; the library designer can't predict all the different ways the code will be used, even though most of the way the code is used will end up being insecure.<p>This is why developers should use high-level libraries like Keyczar and NACL; by sacrificing low-level control and compatibility with legacy cryptosystems, they allow generalist developers to not have to worry about all the implementation attacks.",1352841192

Options are a bit more involved: covered or uncovered? call or put? long or short? Then you've got the option price <i>and</i> the underlying price to think about. Until you're comfortable, it's more than most can manage in their heads.<p>Since we're doing 'sharp tool' analogies, I'd be more inclined to go with hand saw and chainsaw. The level of potential harm you can do to yourselfin an instant with a chainsaw is far greater than that you can achieve with a hand saw - and it's a much bigger difference than that between the efficiency of using a chainsaw and a hand saw. Yes, it's powerful, but it's disproportionately hazardous in untrained or careless hands.",1352840714

But this is why it's going to be really hard for someone that couldn't do part of the job themselves to hire effectively.<p>As to the second point, I guess it's going to depend on the business and on whether the statistical component is crucial or just peripheral.  It's nice if everyone is pretty broadly well trained.

4780582,comment,4779399,4779746,1,0,king_jester,,,"I think both of your examples highlight exactly what the OP was talking about, that employees are not paid based on the value they produce. In both examples, some employer stands to make much more value off of someone's labor than what they will pay that employee. Businesses and capitalists are looking to gain more profit and value than what is reflected in someone's salary -- this is the way they accumulate more resources than those workers. This accumulation of wealth is typically backed by hierarchy and authority structures that maintain that the employer continues to get more value out of someone's work than the employee(s) participating in that work.<p>Like you said, there's nothing about capitalism that says it should do otherwise, but I think for me that shows how unethical capitalism is in how it treats the output of others.",1352840477

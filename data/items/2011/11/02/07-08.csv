I love that there can be a community around any project, no matter how small. It's a powerful philosophy.<p>But I wish more people would understand the differences between 'free' and 'open source'. Open source software is not free. Huge companies invest millions of dollars into open source projects that you probably use. Time is money.<p>Looking at is as a gift not only makes you understand the generosity with which the author(s) has open sourced their code, but when I think about it like that I see that there are real people behind the code and that they should be treated as such.<p>A good lesson.",1320220539

If you have a heuristic to guide you, you get to the end faster than just feeling around your immediate surroundings.<p>There are problems with concept videos, though. Mostly, they seem like a sign of poor leadership.<p>Concept videos aren't a plan. They are a sales pitch. There's only three reasons I can imagine you would need a marketing campaign (not just an elevator pitch and in-depth memo) for your plan - your leadership doesn't buy it, or your staff don't buy it, or there's infighting that is getting resolved internal marketeering. OK, maybe you need to excite the general public, but I doubt it.<p>If Steve Ballmer (or his board) doesn't buy his own lieutenants' plans, it's a problem. If the engineers in MS need to be sold on the plan, it's a problem. And if executives are spending money and time lobbying Ballmer for more resources, that's expected in a big company, but if they think that slick videos are the way to go then things are getting out of hand.<p>MS should be killing internal marketing, both the demand (dummy management not listening) and the supply (encouraging slick middle managers who think their job is to acquire more resources at all costs). There's various ways to do this (mostly techniques known as ""communicating"", ""making hard decisions at the top"", and ""not putting up with the guys who try to pull this shit"").

The answer is yes, once a person matures into adulthood if they haven't acquired this and an appreciation for learning they almost certainly aren't going to. There are people who regard most intellectual activity with disinterest in the best case, and outright hostility in the worst. This group of people is known as ""almost everybody in the world"".<p>As for what to do with them, probably the most consistent approach if you want to stick to something resembling market economics is to let them starve.

5124080,comment,5122429,5123522,1,0,tferris,,,"> The level of language proficiency required to make an app with Node/Express is probably higher than with Django or Rails.<p>Let me add my thoughts: Yes, you need to be good at JS and Node.js but to get there is easy. Maybe these thoughts about JS and that you have to be really good at it come because most of the people who know JS are rather people who fiddle from time to time with JS in the frontend using jQuery doing some DOM stuff (like me before). So, yes you need to know more than that.<p>But: to get there is from my point view much easier than getting good with i.e. Ruby and Rails. Just because you can build a blog in 15 minutes doesn't mean you can program with Rails after 15 minutes. Ruby is heavy (and not consequently more innovative than JS), Rails is ultra heavy with all the conventions you have to learn. In contrast, JS is a sophisticated, modern language and understanding its core concepts can take a while but in total it's more compact regarding the knowledge you have to learn. After getting into JS you need maybe one or two days to get into Node and Express. And little things like the npm surpass the rvm/rbenv/Bundler struggle by far (npm just works, period). Alone the npm is worth trying Node: its elegant design paired with Node's modularity are unmatched.<p>I was much earlier productive than with Rails since Node/Express forces you to think <i>yourself</i> about structure and this makes your more powerful, more smarter -- and just faster. Instead of learning convention after convention you just think about how to code which is much more fun as well. Besides, JS' built in data structures (in particular JSON) and design patterns are amazing and showed me that classic OO maybe isn't aged but very often overcomplicating simple things (the web is not all about CRUD and even then Node is a great answer).<p>Since I don't know Python/Django very well I can't draw a comparison here.",1359290804

5124078,comment,5123916,5123916,6,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Hmph. An anonymous blog from someone that's only been using MacOS for three months. Why is this here?<p>There are some Linux-y things that MacOS gets really, really wrong:<p>- package management. There is a lot of very good open source software that can potentially run on MacOS. If you want to use any of it with a reasonable package manager, you're pretty much forced to choose between either Homebrew or MacPorts, both of which are incompatible with each-other, and neither of which is complete.<p>- the init system, launchd. I'm not super stoked to see systemd gaining ground in Linux, given the occasional troubles with launchd. When launchd works -- and it usually does, to be fair -- it works well and you never think about it. When it <i>doesn't</i> work however, when there's some kind of system problem traced back to something in launchd, good f_cking luck. I hope you really love XML.<p>- user management. It's really easy to create a hidden user in MacOS which will have full access to the session of a logged-in user. (I took advantage of this to play a fun prank on a former employer once.) Desktop Linux kinda-sorta potentially has this problem too, but MacOS exacerbates it with the way it handles user management in system preferences.",1359290760

Because even if you don't do ""crypto"" (in the sense of encrypting/decrypting primitives) everything else you do also relies on the same TLS and JavaScript. My online banking site uses, of course, JavaScript. My online trading platform uses JavaScript. If the browsers and the sites are vulnerable to the attacks he presents (cross side scripting, man-in-the-middle possibilities, code injection attacks from another souce) then it's irrelevant if you do crypto primitives or not, you are vulnerable.<p>On another side, <i>if</i> you assume that other vulnerabilities don't exist, and you do such things online like banking or trading, and you accept that the sites use JavaScript, I don't see any argument why the crypto primitives which run in addition to the rest of the code, everything delivered over TLS and from the same site, are any more suspicious than the rest of the JavaScript.<p>The advantage of the encryption on the client side is obvious. Of course, it would be even better to have the client side encryption controlled by the user separately from the site. But under assumption that I personally control the server from which I deliver my html and JavaScript over TLS, I still feel better having the possibility to encrypt something that I'll upload to the server as long as I assume that the browser is not attacked.<p>The only thing missing is the possibility to somehow checksum the delivered html and code and then ""lock"" that in my browser.

5123972,comment,5121287,5122779,2,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"It's a nice piece of Bayesian reasoning, but it increasingly fails to hold up.<p>The problem is that while there's a very high probability that a randomly-chosen graduate of MIT is <i>very</i> smart and qualified, there's an extremely <i>low</i> probably (and <i>going further down</i>) that any randomly chosen very-smart-and-qualified graduate went to MIT.  So by biasing your hiring towards MIT, you're almost eliminating false positives at the cost of massively increasing false negatives <i>during the hot part of the business cycle when demand for new workers is highest</i>.<p>I've seen a similar effect in action personally.  I went to UMass Amherst for undergrad, and when I finished I did interviews.  Some companies wanted to talk, many didn't, I ended up with two offers from BigCos and lots from SmallCos and start-ups (this was 2011, so yeah, during a hot-hiring cycle), but still a noticeable ""failure rate"".<p>I get a <i>little</i> bit of real work experience and then come to Technion (which, at least in <i>this</i> country, is not known to be called ""Israel Institute of Technology"" for nothing) for graduate school.  Internship-application season arrives.  Now <i>everyone</i> wants to talk, and the only things to which I can rationally attribute the change are the name-brand of Technion and the fact of having had some work experience (which does set me strongly above ""pure academics"", but many people work between undergrad and grad school).<p><i>I</i> didn't change (much).  I just acquired a pre-made Bayesian evaluation of my potential from someone whose word is taken more seriously than that of UMass Amherst.  And the <i>really neat trick</i> here is that Technion simply is not as selective as MIT, by sheer numbers: I'm told that maybe the top 10% of applicants can get into Technion for undergrad, and another 20% of those (2% total) can do well enough to go on for an advanced degree.  These are far more than the percentages of applicants who can get into the CS programs at Stanford, CMU, Berkeley and MIT <i>combined</i>.  Technion just doesn't have equally tough competition for entry due to its smaller applicant pool.",1359288149

5277979,comment,5276851,5277033,58,0,gnarbarian,,,"The UI in Dwarf Fortress is completely indefensible. Even when you do understand how to play the game it's a kludge. Let alone the fact that AN ASCII GAME CAN BRING AN 8 CORE DESKTOP TO A CRAWL.  (The ASCII is actually rendered in OPENGL for performance which is a joke in and of itself because 99% of the system resources are spent poorly simulating stagnant blocks of air rock and dirt with nothing happening to them).<p>There are many amazing and laudable aspects to DF. Tarn has a physics background and in this regard the game is well thought out. It has unmatched emergent gameplay and behavior due to the physics and complexity of each dwarf.<p>What isn't well thought out at all are both the 'design' of the software and interface. This is the most beautifully complex game with endless unique and hilarious morsels of awesome (the naming of geographic features and depictions engraved on items) Yet absolutely no effort is spent on conveying that to the user.  It's like the game itself is autistic in its savant level complexity and all that beauty is hidden behind an utterly unusable interface and horribly inefficient software design.<p>Dwarf Fortress is a perverse decent into a single brilliant yet mal adjusted person's 'ideal' game. It's wildly capable and meticulously tended to in all the wrong areas while the  glaringly obvious flaws go unattended.<p>It's like a brilliant  mathematician who shits on the floor and writes earth-shattering proofs on discarded fast food bags leaving them strewn about homeless shelters. The hobos (DF fans) all rightfully commend his genius and defend the antisocial idiosyncratic behavior as ""part of the creative process"" or that anything else would detract from 'the experience' of reading a revolutionary proof off of a shit stained McDonalds bag.<p>The main problem is Tarn's inability to work with anyone else or compromise.  The poor quality interface and software design is a perfect metaphor for the developer behind it. The smallest improvement such as rendering more ASCII layers at once from an isometric perspective would  vastly improve the usability and likely expand the userbase by 10 fold yet no effort is made to make ANY UI adjustments.<p>Minecraft is the perfect example of the level of success DF is capable of. Their premise is quite similar, but where Notch's effort went into a simplistic usable UI with simple physics, Tarn went without a UI and devoted his effort to a bewilderingly complex and amazingly inefficent engine with no reasonable way for anyone to experience it.  Tarn could be a multi millionare if he simply would take some damn advice about sofware and UI design.<p>Seriously, With two more people helping him, one person focused on optimizing the codebase and another focused on improving the UI this would literally be one of the greatest games of all time.<p>Until that day DF will remain an obscure oddity, like a model train set with a revolutionary efficient engine whose owner steadfastly refuses anyone to use it in anything except a toy which actually causes physical pain to all who attempt to play with it.",1361782409

The following is my answer for the non-computer hack question from the YC application and in this instance I believe related to social engineering.<p>One day while in college I was walking across campus to get to class.  As students do, in one direction students walk on the right-hand side of the sidewalk and in the opposite direction students walk to their right resulting in an efficient flow of foot traffic.  On this day a rotating sprinkler was intermittently splashing the sidewalk causing a bottle neck on the sidewalk.  To this day I have no idea why, but I stepped off the sidewalk.   I saw the problem, the students had non-verbally adopted the etiquette of allowing 5-10 students walking in one direction to pass the sprinkler then stop, and allow an equal number of students to pass from the opposite direction. By this time I could tell I went from the observer to the observed, it felt like hundreds of students had their eyes on me wondering, ""who is this maverick? What is this sidewalk etiquette anarchist up to?""<p>In the moment I fell to action. I walked up to the sprinkler from behind and moved it so it no longer splashed the sidewalks.  Immediately, I received a standing ovation - granted the students who applauded me were already standing, but I could tell if they were sitting they would have stood up before making noise with their hands.",1361782401

There are many people who work hard and go to prison for other reasons. Saying ""Taking shortcuts"" and insinuating that all people in prison lack the job skills (ignoring the fact that being in prison makes it extremely difficult to find employment even with skills) implies laziness, but saying ""these people"" is a tricky way to reduce an entire population into a single characterization. Some would consider this classist or racist given the the classes and races which make up much of the population of prisons. I'm emphatically not accusing you of this, given that I would imagine people on HN would be above that, but A) you should be sensitive to it, not only for those in prison but also for all the people who have people in their lives who are in prison, and they may find this painful or offensive.  But also B) remember that directly going after people with money is sometimes shortsighted. We share the same culture regardless of income, including (importantly) much of the internet, so taste and internet traffic may be dictated by people who come from literally anywhereCristal was built from a nothing brand into a billion dollar industry by being name dropped in hip-hop music, and lost business after racist/classist comments leading to Jay-Z boycotting them. Not everyone in prison is going to have what it takes to do a startup, but they should also not be ignored. Some of the richest people in America were born to poverty, so don't discount them immediately.<p>I say this as a member of the target audience of pretty much everyone on HN and an immense fan of Trailer Park Boys.",1361782187

Even if the 1127 group imported outside code for the VAX versions of research Unix (v8-10), they liked a particular kind of documentation, which the imported code lacked, so they wrote their own.

Brogue simplifies a lot of the redundancies in Nethack and condenses it down into the core elements of dungeon crawling.  While it's a much less complex game, it doesn't sacrifice much in depth.  You still get loads of interesting emergent stories.<p>Brogue is probably the most accessible amongst the text-based roguelikes - it's interface is excellent, it manages to be very visually appealing without straying from the ascii aesthetic, and the design of it is streamlined and elegant.",1361782077

5277946,comment,5277280,5277783,2,0,ajhit406,,,"Hey Josh, thanks for the thoughts.<p>You can use tools like Boxen, Puppet or Chef, but those tools are not useful for less experienced developers or designers who have to run the full stack just to touch the markup. Many developers prefer to write code instead of having to maintain scripts to build development environments.  Similarly in production, many developers prefer a PaaS like Heroku or AppFog over dealing with VPSes or EC2.<p>Another caveat of setting up development environments locally is that you have to repeat the setup procedure for every machine that you would like to develop on.<p>Cloud environments make it easier to adhere to important application design patterns like treating backing services (like databases or caches) as attached resources.  It also makes it easier to run the entire spectrum of your application on the same infrastructure, reducing dev / prod runtime issues in the continuous delivery process.<p>The collaborative opportunities are also really exciting. Pair programming collaboration (we pair remotely pretty often), as well as sharing and cloning environments are made possible by hosting the environment on the cloud.<p>We have some other great ideas in development currently that we think will significantly reduce the amount of time you spend setting up, managing, and using your environment, and the time you spend synchronizing your environment with teammates.<p>With regards to your location question-- Our company is incorporated and headquartered in the US; our main office is in Menlo Park, although we do also roam around the city a lot. Happy to grab a beer with you sometime if you're in San Francisco!<p>The majority of our infrastructure is on AWS, and while we do utilize their global availability zones, you can choose the regions where your box is provisioned.<p>Happy to send you an invite, just email us at hello at action dot io<p>Cheers

5277923,comment,5276230,5277394,1,0,orangethirty,,,"@mctx && @kamaal,<p>1. I spend a lot of time planning my day, week, month, trimester. I don't go longer than that because plans change so much that its not useful. Planning is crucial, and real hard work. If you are not planning, then you are just wasting resources away.<p>I do plan differently than other people. I don't use TODO lists. Mine are more scribbles on a notebook. Each day I set a goal of completing <i>n</i> amount tasks and focus on getting them done. They can be for something from the present, or for something one month away. Having such flixibility allows me to buy myself time.<p>2. I track my momentum. The more I do the more I want to do. I have this neat little calendar that I created myself called ""The Snowball Calendar"", where I keep track of every productive day I've had. Just imagine a printed calendar and each day is crossed with a big red X. I put this in a place where its visible. Gets me amped up to keep working towards my goals by just seeing how much Ive done already.<p>3. I allow myself to just get up and leave at almost any time (unless Im with a client or doing some specific work). Sometimes I get on my truck and get a table at Chilli's. Then spend about 2-3 hours working from there. Other times I simply go to the backyard with my laptop. :)<p>4. I meditate. But not any Zen-style meditation. I do what I call <i>work mediation</i>. In it I see what I want to accomplish already done, then trace back the steps needed to complete it. I really like doing this because it really eases a lot of pains that come up during projects. A great example is that I use this technique to first write the programs in my head, and then onto the computer. I can really cut down coding time if I just write the whole thing in my mind.<p>5. I dont have a strict schedule, say from 9-5. Doesnt work for me. I do things in blocks of time. Length varies by task. Sometimes Im a complete night owl, and sometimes I wake up early in the morning and work. My sleep is not deprived because I take nap breaks.<p>6. I don't surf the web from any of my workstations. I only do it from my iPod. Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, HN, reddit, etc., they are only accessed from the iPod. The workstations are for work only. I have one for code, one for writing, and two servers that power Nuuton's crawler.<p>7. I make sure to work while doing other things. Not multi-tasking, though. Say I'm cleaning around the house. I keep a pen and notebook at hand. While cleaning my mind wanders off. Every few minutes I get a burst of data coming in. I stop and write those things down. Every thought.<p>8. I exercise well. Exercise keeps me in top shape. Plus my best ideas and solutions always come when Im running on the track.<p>9. I dont follow a particular diet, but I make sure to count calories and eat well. Eating fast food is just detrimental to productivity because my body shuts down. I feel sleepy and tired from all the junk in it.<p>10. I take mini vacations where I just dont do anything at all. Nothing. Just sleep, watch netflix, and eat. This past weekend was one of such. After working hard for a month and a half (average 80 hours a week because I also worked on Sundays), I had to take a break. So I took it.<p>11. I dont waste time picking my clothes. I have a standard attire that I use every day (like an uniform).<p>I'm basically working or thinking about things during the whole day. But I have always been like this. And Im not sure if this is something that anyone can copy or do (or even learn). Its just the way I am. I know of people who are very productive working much less than I do. So it just differs from person to person.",1361781437

I have always enjoyed a high protein and vegetable diet, but a ton of pasta and pizza too. About a year ago, my wife and I (and by proxy, our kids) cut out gluten, wheat, and sugar. Within a week (closer to three for the wife), we all noticed higher energy levels and just felt better. Our oldest kid had complained of stomach issues for quite some time, up until this change in diet. Interestingly enough, these issues come back when she has bread or pasta (or pizza, as you point out). We all feel worse after eating these foods. We still do it every couple of weeks because, hey, it tastes good. But by avoiding these mostly processed foods, we genuinely feel better. We all still eat burgers; just with no bun. I'd encourage you to try it for two weeks and see if you feel better or not. If not, more ammo for your argument.",1361779256

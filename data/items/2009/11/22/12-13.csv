Maybe it's more often - I don't know - but it isn't a problem that I want solved.<p>If this was craigslist related, then I would be interested though. This is just my personal shopping habit but I find this problem more with auction-based sites like ebay/craigslist than other online system. If I could specify specifics - model, price - then it would be awesome!",1258894726

955678,comment,954565,954800,0,0,samuel,,,"Personally I don't get ORM's. May be it's because the only I have had to deal with was Hibernate, and seemed to me as an innecesary layer of complexity and bloat, and objects and relations sometimes doesn't map nicely. If you want to persist objects, use an object datastore in the first place, not a relational one.<p>And, what's wrong with SQL? It's simple, powerful, widely known and deployed, and cool(declarative programming, dude!).<p>I've read a some introductory examples about distinct ORM's and just don't get it. Where's the gain? Apart from database independence(which I don't think it's even desirable in most cases, may be Tom Kyte's books have brainwashed me irremediably), can't see one. How an ORM makes you more productive?",1258892889

I would also like to see an API for general government records.<p>For example, if we had voting records, we could finally stop hearing all this ""but you voted on -----"" ""no I didn't go back and check the record"" ""no look you voted on ----- which is basically the same"" ""shut up I served in the war"" ""yay war"" stuff every election.  We could just look it up and say ""hey look you did"".  The Times ""Congress API"" is on its way to this, but last I checked, all it had was the attendance records.",1258892687

We're actually living through the golden age of reading right now -- HN is symptomatic of this; can you imagine HN existing in the pre-web or pre-usenet era? -- but there's a lot more noise in the system, and the existing distribution networks are crumbling in the face of competition (just as with the record and movie businesses before them).<p>Borders and B&N aren't healthy businesses. And as for the mass market paperback distribution ecosystem, it nearly collapsed completely back in late 2008. But that doesn't mean there's no demand for the product; all it means is that some intermediate stages in the supply chain are borked. (And no, Amazon is not the answer -- at least, not from the writers or publishers point of view. <i>Shudder</i>.)<p><i>Of course</i> F&SF and Asimov's are showing declining newsstand circulation. What's interesting is that they're both on the rise in ebook editions ... and nobody's talking about <a href=""http://www.tor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tor.com/</a> and their fiction-publishing habits (which, ahem, pay <i>rather more</i> than the traditional monthlies, suggesting that there's money in the vertical integration/social network model they're pursuing).",1258891727

Yes, _Halting State_ is good too, but in _Glasshouse_ Stross manages to get his temptation to wink at the reader under control and as a result writes a classic.

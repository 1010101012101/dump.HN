5301668,comment,5300255,5301502,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"In fairness, what you do is buy the raw ingredients to make 5 ro 10 times the amount of beef stew you want and either freeze the rest or eat stew for 2 or 3 days in a row. That sounds dull if you're single and like variety in your diet, but if you have a family it's quite practical.<p>Make friends with your freezer. Meat production, like everything else, goes in cycles so at regular intervals producers (and thus) supermarkets will find themselves with excess stock of this or that. The obvious example is buying turkey after Thanksgiving, but I see cycles in things like the price of pork every 4-6 weeks. So about every other month I buy a whole boneless pork loin (a single piece of meat about as long as your forearm) for about $25 instead of the usual cost of around $50. I spend about 20 minutes at home slicing it into pork steaks and freezing most of them, and get 20+ nice thick steaks out of it, so that's about $1.05 each. Add in the cost of the vegetables, other ingredients, energy to cool and cook, and the price of a good size meal is still only $2.50 at most.<p>That's a particularly good deal (which is why I buy it so regularly) but if you can cook and don't mind forward planning your food a bit, you save a lot of money. Menu planning probably cuts your cost by 50% vs. buying your ingredients on a per-meal basis.",1362092116

We've had trouble with this as people shift from project to project or work is shifted from one role to another (eg: junior to senior developer) which changes the amount of time available for the fixed budget we had planned. I was interested in his input since he has a lot of experience running large Enterprise departments.<p>He told me that he had tried different approaches over the years, and the best approach was to charge the maximum rate for all roles on the project. The working assumption is that senior workers will tend to do the work faster and on their own, but junior developers will require oversight from senior developers. That justifies the higher rate for juniors; it offsets the time that seniors have to spend mentoring them, which also ensures that the same quality of work is produced whether it's done by a senior or junior.<p>Charging the same rate for everyone greatly simplifies budgeting, especially if some parts of the project turn out to be  over-estimated while others were under-estimated when the initial budget is put together. If all hours are the same price, you can shift them freely where they're needed as reality starts to beat up your plan. When hours have different prices, it's a lot more complicated to do that.",1362091494

The last time I had a go on it on my laptop, things broke unpredictably, a little at a time.  When I say unpredictably, I mean totally by surprise, not even after performing an update.  First, Pulse audio stopped working.  Spent a few days trying to fix it, then gave up and reverted to Alsa.  Then the graphical login got stuck in an endless loop cycle.  So reverted to text login, starting X manually after I'd log in.  When wireless stopped working, I gave up.  I run the LTS Xubuntu on two other machines and neither of them have had problems like this.  I put my laptop on the LTS Xubuntu and it's been good since.<p>I'm guessing mainstream Ubuntu gets more QA and is more stable than Xubuntu.  It might be harder for derivative distros to keep up with a rolling release.  Or maybe not... this might give them more flexibility to QA stuff as needed instead of trying to keep up with a new release every six months.

We have a privacy policy in which our lab does not know the name of the customer through the entire process ensuring confidentiality. We also delete your DNA after 30 days when your guarantee expires. Finally to ensure your identity protection, we do not sequence your entire DNA. We only sequence a portion. You can think of this as only having the first four digits of a credit card. To actually have an even better idea, imagine only having one digit of your credit card. That's the amount of DNA that is sequenced in respect to the entire human genome.

2892910,comment,2891525,2892091,1,0,Turing_Machine,,,"I prefer iOS myself, but there are reasons other than Google's sponsorship at work here. Apple is dead set against allowing user-created or downloaded code to run (other than JavaScript). That means that tools like AppInventor just aren't as practical for iOS (sure, every student <i>could</i> fork over $99 to become a developer, but...). In fact, Apple pulled the Scratch port from the App Store some time ago (Scratch is a similar visual programming language, also from MIT). I understand Apple's reasons for exercising tight control over distribution, and even agree with them to a large degree. It <i>would</i> be nice, though, if you were at least allowed to download code to your own phone without being a registered developer. That would definitely make iOS more student-friendly.<p>What I'd really like to see is the ability to distribute apps to a limited number of devices (similar to the current ad hoc provisioning), so students could play around with networked apps. Apple could still require a registered dev account before allowing stuff in the App Store for distribution to the general public.",1313529206

Great new architecture, custom networks, custom hardware. Initially, they put Linux on the I/O nodes and a custom kernel on the compute nodes, because you want a minimum of OS noise (see the FTQ benchmark for more info on this). But everyone clamored for Linux on compute nodes--so now we boot this enormous Linux kernel on each compute node. Plan 9 was ported (I did some of it), but nobody wanted it because it wasn't Linux.<p>I'm of the opinion that no group in the world is as set-in-their-ways and reactionary as the supercomputing application developers.

There's a tension between the desire to make a good impression on a first-time client and the desire to make sure they're not taking you for a ride.<p>Fortunately there are often warning signs when a client is going to be particularly difficult, and there are far more decent clients than unsavory ones.",1313528501

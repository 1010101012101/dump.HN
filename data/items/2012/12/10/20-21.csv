This allows us to pretty easily import existing definitions. For example, Google had a tmlanguahe file for Dart that I was able to translate in less than an hour.<p>Could you describe more about what you like about CM's highlight rules? I admit I've never really looked into them. But I'm guessing by ""show local variables in a different color"" there's some parsing going on?",1355173197

Take a restaurant with tile floors and cheap ceilings -- not only does that make it louder, but people have to then talk louder to be heard.  And that in turn makes the volume even louder yet.

Without philosophy we have nothing, no science or math. If greatness is doing the best we possibly can at everything we do then that's ""great"" for us personally but does it make other's lives great as well?  It is one thing to be of the highest possible skill level, or in other words ""great"", at something like programming but what if your goal is to make everyone who touches your work from testers to line managers live's easier?  Wouldn't you be perceived as ""great"" regardless of your skills as a programmer?  Will Smith seems like such a great guy his energy just radiates from everything he says and does and his work ethic is also inspiring.

That's what leads to popular conceptions based only on accusation and rumors.  But A+ for passive aggression.<p>Flash and sync are features that have been in Chrome for a really long time.  So they're not an example of Chrome ""getting bloated.""  <i>If</i> Chrome is slower now than it was in the past, it isn't because of these, since previous versions of Chrome that you'd be using for the comparison also had these features.<p>You might just want to check your system for laggy spyware.

I wanted to get SMS notifications (in addition to email notifications), but the only way to do that (besides paying for a relatively expensive full account) was to add my cell number's SMS gateway address [phone number]@sms.att.net. I did that for a while, but wasn't satisfied with the experience (each notification comes from a different number, and is formatted strange). Also, while Pingdom covers every scenario imaginable, I just wanted to be able to make sure a few web pages were responding with a 200 OK, and my main servers were online.<p>After surveying the landscape of monitoring services, I noticed few did everything I wanted (notify me when my site is down, allow me to track a few sites, and send me text messages and emails) for less than $30-50/year. So, after doing a little research, I found I could offer the exact service I wanted for around $10-15/year (that's $1.00-1.50/month) if I did it on my own. And so I built Server Check.in.<p>Server Check.in uses Stripe for payment acceptance (leagues beyond PayPal in terms of UX and DX), Twilio for SMS notifications ($0.01/message is bearable, and means there's room for a small profit), and Drupal on a LAMP server. Drush ('DRUpal SHell') handles most of the back-end (processing queues, checking servers, etc.), and I built the responsive HTML5 theme using Zen. Three custom modules drive the site, and integrate the notification and payment services. I have a post that explains the architecture with more detail here: <a href=""http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/blog/2012/server-checkin-website-and"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/blog/2012/server-checkin-websit...</a><p>I stuck with what I know (a LAMP stack) for this project, though I'm dabbling in Python and Node.js to see if I might want to move more of the backend services away from PHP and shell scripting. I hope the service will grow large enough that I'll need to expand horizontally, but right now there's plenty of room for an initial batch of users.<p>Also, check out the 404 page; I made a little easter egg that I hope I can make more interesting over time :)<p>I'd appreciate any feedback; especially any ideas for improvement, or ways I could make it a more enticing service for other developers.<p>If you'd like to sign up, here's a coupon code for 20% off your first year: hn_twenty_off",1355171610

Ducks make easy prey and watering birds in the shallows are only moderately more difficult. Probably one of the most voracious shallow-water predators is the Northern Pike, which I've seen catch birds, mice and other animals many times while fishing in Canada. At my Dad's house in northern California, we see Bass suck under small ducklings many times a year.<p>Unlike the Catfish, Bass, Pike and other shallow water predators have specific behavior for lying in wait. They will stop in the water, use the pectoral fins to hold stable and then curl their tail to one side. This allows them to rapidly straighten their bodies and blast forward in one swift stroke to seize prey. Note in the video that the catfish do not employ this - they make a snapping/sucking motion with their jaws to draw the prey in.<p>One of the largest Bass I ever caught was hooked using a fly I tied, made to look like a Robin. I had seen a 14+ lb. Largemouth attempting to eat robins that were landing on lily pads.

I learned a lot, and ended up coming face-to-face with monads and monad transformers (though I didn't realize it at the time) and the limitations and complications that mutable data structures (as opposed to immutable ones) imply for dataflow/FRP frameworks. My work on that library stopped when I shifted from NodeJS to Clojure/ClojureScript for my day-to-day work. Now that I'm a bit more experienced with functional programming, monads, etc., I hope to find some time to restart that effort, using ClojureScript (and protocol-monads[4]?) as the foundation.<p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/michaelsbradleyjr/protocol-monads"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/michaelsbradleyjr/protocol-monads</a>",1355170189

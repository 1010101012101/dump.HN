his cook's uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper
assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served
out; and a long grace was said over the short commons.  The gruel
disappeared; the boys whispered each other, and winked at Oliver;
while his next neighbors nudged him.  Child as he was, he was
desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery.  He rose from
the table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand,
said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:<p>'Please, sir, I want some more.' ...""</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext96/olivr11.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext96/olivr11.txt</a><p>In other words attack Tims poor stand on <i>""software as a service""</i> doing everyone a disservice as software might again slip into hands of Dickensian like masters where users are reduced to begging for permission to access to fix a piece of buggy software critical to their business and communication.

The fundamental difference between a service and a piece of desktop software is that you can't steal it.<p>In a society where everyone has access to free software and an internal moral compass is the only thing that deters us from piracy, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to release desktop software with no service component.",1186188259

So for someone like me, in a position where I have very little money and I want to get out of that situation, to hear ""Whatever people make should be free"" is just silly.  Yes, open source is wonderful, and I really want to contribute to it.  But needing to feed myself everyday and to pay for my car and a place to live takes precedence.<p>Would you tell PG that Viaweb should've been free?  Why?  Because it's a service?  There's no fundamental difference between a service and a piece of desktop software, except you can't steal it.",1186185831

341110,comment,341025,341100,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Sun already has multicore behemoths - it's the CoolThreads platform (UltraSparc T1 and T2 processors). Dozens of cores - and I've used them and they run concurrent Java really, really well.<p>As for specialised hardware. Sun used to produce/specify the picoJava, microJava and ultraJava processor architectures (processors designed for Java).... They all tanked. The problem wasn't the implementation - it was timing. They came about just when the processor world was coming to the conclusion that the instruction set architecture didn't matter - AMD proved this by bolting x86 onto a RISC core (proved it by doing this, and then by winning the performance war for a number of years with it).<p>Problem now for Sun is timing again - the market combined with their market share. It will be a challenge to hold onto the market they've got, and a bigger challenge to grow into other areas.",1224766767

   2. people become interested in what you're doing
   3. people get excited about what you're doing 
</code></pre>
I would say it was more about people understanding what your product can do for them, identifying it's value and thus parting with their money.",1224766744

341097,comment,341043,341065,0,0,jm4,,,"I've got one too and I'm very happy with it. I've used the iPhone quite a bit and it's ok. So far I like the G1 better. The buttons on the front and the scroll ball make it a little easier to navigate around. The standard applications work well. I like how the notification bar works. I was surprised at how much was already in the Android Market on day one. It seems like some of them are also on the iPhone, but there are some exclusives too. Locale is an especially cool application that isn't possible on the iPhone. There are quite a few that make use of the GPS. One that I found amusing, although still innovative, is iSafe. Among other things it can alert you when you enter a high crime neighborhood or when there is a registered sex offender nearby. Call quality and reception are generally good. I like how the screen automatically locks when I put the phone up to my ear during a call. Overall, I'm impressed by it. I had expected it to be much less polished than it is. It's also not nearly as ugly as it looks in the pictures. It's actually kind of nice looking in a minimalist way.<p>I do have a few gripes, though. First is battery life. I expected it would be mediocre, but it's downright terrible. I have to recharge it in the middle of the day. The silver lining here is that the battery is removable so I can carry a spare with me. I really hope they come out with a higher capacity battery soon. Another part that could have been better is the keyboard. The keys are just a little too flat and feel just a bit spongy. It's not a bad keyboard by any means, but I would prefer one more like the Sidekick. Multitouch would be a nice plus too.<p>It's also worth saying something about the first paragraph of the NYT article. The author says there was no one waiting in line at the store for the G1. That's because we didn't need to. People who preordered the G1 had it delivered. I even had mine delivered a day early. I'm not sure that there would be people lining up otherwise, but it's still a little misleading.",1224765699

341093,comment,340317,340317,0,0,rapind,,,"I've never been a rackspace fan, since way back in the day. Way expensive and I never liked the managed hosting space. However, I believe the jungle disk and slicehost acquisitions are very smart moves. JD was one of the first (might have been THE first actually) to provide a synch/backup client for S3 when it was introduced. Smart people, good idea, and the technology isn't going away. If they keep the people they'll be an asset. Slicehost has a great image in the hacker community and I love their documentation.<p>Both companies fit nicely in the cloud space, an VPS is definitely the future. Rackspace is giving an ear to some smart engineers in their camp, which I think is great and kinda googlish. They've got my attention now, for what that's worth.",1224765536

It's in use in more than a few <i>major</i> websites(I know from experience).<p>The beauty of it is:\nA) Couldn't be any simpler and faster to implement<p>B) A 404 page actually can be a better user experience. If you give the user a ""Coming Soon"" or ""Under construction"" or ""We didnt really build this page, but wanted to AB test whether it would be worth it""---those can be actually more confusing to the <i>average</i> internet user than a 404. Remember, the average internet user probably doesn't even know what market testing means.<p>C) In my experience, when it is used it's used in a very small fraction of visits(just enough to get a relatively significant result set), so only a very small number of visitors actually reach the 404.<p>D) The users that reach the 404 might be annoyed for a sec, but generally return to what they were doing before.<p>E) Because it's so fast and easy to implement, and there is only 1 key variable to look at (number of clicks), it can quickly be used over and over for many different situations(think: easy to automate).",1218650365

For instance, many hackers can't fathom why so many people use Facebook (and don't try to understand that target population, but just ignore it or write a blog post about how Facebook has no value to them).<p>If you have the ability (and I really think it is a skill that you have to train) to understand other people and their motivations and needs, then I would suggest doing what edw is saying. But, from experience trying to teach my own hacker friends, this ability is very hard to learn.<p>Unfortunately for hackers, making what they themselves want often only caters to a small niche market in the vast world of people out there, so it might be useful to invest some time in learning how to understand other people, or team up with someone who has that ability in one form or the other.",1218650356

IMHO, if you've got a web app that users are savvy enough to know that they need, especially one that costs money, 9 times out of 10 they're going to be savvy enough to know that getting a 404 page with your branding on it is your company's problem, not theirs.<p>I know this because I work for a company that provides an enterprise B2B web app, and customers already consistently blame the stuff that ISN'T our problem (connection, filters, ancient browser, javascript turned off, etc.) on us.<p>And yes, a lot of 404's are due to improper URI entry and ""cross-site link rot""... but isn't that a completely moot point since we're talking about <i>internal links</i>?",1218649835

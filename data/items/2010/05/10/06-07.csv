I get the sense that you believe that Stross and Scalzi are rationalizing what you believe is learned helplessness on their part?  If so, that isn't what I believe they are saying.

I'm not convinced that the likelihood of being charged is minuscule either.  Neither of these seem to be reasonable options for most people.<p>And in any case, I have now received a refund, so I wouldn't feel comfortable jail-breaking a copy.

I obsessed over getting 97s and 98s rather than 94s and 95s.  While we weren't officially ranked, it was well known that out of 700-800 students in your class, a 98 average put you in the top 5, and a 94 put you somewhere in the top 100-200.  Because the school released college admissions statistics (in the format of GPA | SAT | accepted/rejected/waitlist), you could see that you have empirically little chance of getting into Harvard with that 94, but a very very good chance with that 98.<p>That said, most people were generally very smart, passionate and inspiring people to be around.

1333740,comment,1332859,1333264,0,0,EdwardCoffin,,,"It's quite possible that sometime in the future, even the near future, an ebook library on a given subject will be the equal of a paper library on that same subject.  Right now that is not the case for a significant number of domains, just because some of the important books in those domains are not yet available as electronic books.<p>Of course, if you regard books as fungible, this might not matter to you.  For some of us, it is important to have a particular book, not just a substitute.  For instance, if I want clarification in calculus, I want to refer to the particular calculus textbook I have spent a lot of time studying, not to a different text.  If I read 20,000 leagues under the sea, I want to read one of the recent and competent translations to English, not one of the earlier ones that had mistaken conversions from metric to imperial and entire passages left out because they offended the translator.  As far as I can tell, none of the Kindle nor Gutenberg versions of this book are one of the good translations.  Similarly for Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: I want the Womersley edition, and that edition isn't currently available in an electronic format.  If I'm discussing history with someone I might want to cite a passage out of one of the books I've read on the subject, a particular book, like <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i> or <i>From Dawn to Decadence</i>.  Neither of those are available as electronic books.  Though I guess if I never read anything but electronic books, this would not be a problem: I wouldn't want to cite them because I wouldn't have read them.<p>Many books I care about probably will never be converted to ebooks.  They aren't old enough to be classics, but not recent enough for the publishers to feel there would be a profit in reissuing them in a new format.<p>And of course there is the problem of DRM.  There is then the possibility that a book you thought you owned has turned into a pumpkin because because the ebook reader refuses to show it to you unless it can talk with a license server that no longer exists, because the vendor you bought the book from has switched formats.  This happened to me a few years ago with an Adobe eBook I purchased from Amazon: they dropped support (or Adobe dropped them, I'm not sure) when they switched to Kindle.  The fact that the transition between possessing a working electronic book and possessing a non-working electronic book can happen silently; the only way you can be sure is to regularly open up the book and to test it every time you move to a new computer or even reinstall the operating system.  This does not contribute to a feeling of confidence.  Until the books I care about are available in some confidence-inspiring electronic format, I will retain my paper library, despite the inconvenience of storing and moving it.  The inconveniences minor compared to the benefits I derive from it.  I'm not sure whether one of these benefits might be signalling to the world how smart I am; nobody has ever commented on the matter in a positive way, thought a few acquaintances have expressed opinions similar to yours.<p>On the other hand, if all of the books you care about actually are available as eBooks and you have some confidence that the the ones you care about retaining will continue to be available (not turn into pumpkins), or if you regard reading as a simple pastime where you don't much care which book you read next and are willing to choose from those available in electronic form, then eBooks, as they currently stand, are great.  They aren't for everyone though.  Not yet.",1273473275

Not only has GM been able to successfully wind down or spin off ailing brands, renegotiate/get out of ridiculous labor contracts, cut down the size of the dealer network, consolidate their supply chain, but they have done so at unprecedented speed - <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,531022,00.html?FORM=ZZNR3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,531022,00.html?FORM=ZZNR...</a><p>So much so that it's CFO said it might post a profit this year - <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/business/18auto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/business/18auto.html</a> - Yes, I know there is probably a lot of financial shenanigans going on here...but 24 months ago, this would never have been the case (even with financial shenanigans). I would say that this is the best thing that ever happened to GM. If mgmt can revive the brand and focus on good products, in 5 - 10 years we might not even remember that GM went through this period.<p>Not to mention the hundreds of millions (if not billions) in highly subsidized loans and VC money the administration has given to 'electric/hybrid' companies in the auto industry - from Tesla to Fisker (<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125383160812639013.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125383160812639013.html</a>) to many others in between, I would be willing to bet that the auto industry in 10 years is going to be radically different than the last 10 years, and I would probably bet that America leads the way in innovation again (after ceding it to Japan and Asia for the last 10 years).<p>Ok...the health care argument, yes the bill wasn't perfect...but guess what..at least he did something. The reality is the current system couldn't stay, and something had to be done. We will see what the final implementation looks like, but I am pretty sure it won't have any death panels.<p>I am not advocating oil & gas price controls, but the fact remains that America (and the West in general) is highly dependent on oil from relatively volatile areas of the world. Yes, people have cried wolf many times and it hasn't always borne out in 'rations', but as a result of the market doing it's thing, we have seen massive price run ups in those commodities (to almost unprecedented levels) right before major economic downturns. From the 70s, to 2000, to last year. One thing that was consistent with all recessions in those times are sky-high energy prices - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_Unite...</a> \nThe most recent recession was coupled with financial mayhem, so that eclipsed the high energy prices...but it doesn't take away from the fact that the US economy is highly dependent on foreign oil.<p>As far as I know, regulators and the government (both this one and previous ones) never tolerate/promote insider trading or the backdating of stock options. There are some economists that argue that both shouldn't matter in an 'efficient market', because it would only make the market more efficient by pricing in more information more quickly. I am not sure I agree with that, due to misaligned incentives of executives and shareholders, but that's another argument for another thread.<p>Re: the gov't suppressing IPOs...there are so many things wrong with this statement I don't even know where to start. For starters, a startup shouldn't be a 'vehicle' to an IPO. So the mere fact that you think the gov't 'didn't help us any' because they made the road to IPOs a bit more bumpy, I would suggest that perhaps you need to rethink why you are doing a startup in the first place. Even in 'rosier boom boom' times, driving towards an IPO without solid fundamentals is like gambling. If you have solid fundamentals (i.e. strong revenues, gross & net margins + high ROE + high growth potential) then SARBOX won't have too much of a negative impact on your IPO. Don't believe me? Look at Google. SARBOX implemented in 2002 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes-Oxley_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes-Oxley_Act</a>), Google IPOd in 2004 (<a href=""http://www.google-ipo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google-ipo.com/</a>). If you aren't familiar with the success of Google's IPO, you should probably review it. If anything, SARBOX made the industry healthier, because it weeded out the crappy startups that were relying on hype and fluff (i.e. quite frankly fraud).<p>Ailes is his sidekick @ News Corp and tends to have more extreme views than Murdoch does. e.g. he strongly supports Glenn Beck.

But our eyes are extremely sensitive to lag - even done 100% locally, it's difficult to be fast enough (or used to be).<p>To compensate, we can download a whole environment, and track the eyes locally.",1273472275

Do you really think that 1 in 3 paying FV players will leave because they have to type in a new URL to play? They're already willing to type in their credit card information, and that process is much longer.",1273472196

Assuming they are having successful sales, this could be a good example of taking a well-defined product, targetting a completely different audience, and cutting out/focusing on features that will resonate with this audience.<p>For reference, take a look at the leading OBD-II iPhone app Rev (<a href=""http://www.devtoaster.com/products/rev/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.devtoaster.com/products/rev/</a>). I've actually owned and enjoyed this app for the past 2 years. It pretty much does everything. Anything you can do through the OBD-II port, you can do, and customize completely to how you need it. It also does the CEL lights, which is pretty standard. But selling to auto enthusiasts, this app focuses on the performance features.<p>No car geek would ever recommend GoPoint over Rev, but for someone that's interested in environmental impact and fuel economy, GoPoint's simplicity and price clearly wins.",1273472044

I didn't have a laptop through the entire thing.<p>A computer, sure.  I had one in my dorm room.  Laptops were nice, but not essential.  I certainly hope that hasn't changed in the past seven years... it would be pretty sad if so.<p>(Then again, I also didn't have a cell phone during college, and now I have no idea how I got along without one.)<p>edit: To my recollection, when I was in college, the people who had laptops in class did email, wasted time on Slashdot, or played games.  Seems like it was more of a distraction than it was useful.",1273472009
1333714,comment,1332954,1333409,0,0,nixme,,,"I <i>strongly</i> disagree with your recommendations for Campbell and Robbins (and I assume you mean John Robbins, not Tim Robbins). Like most nutritionists, they do agree on eliminating refined carbohydrates and processed foods from your diet. But these two specifically argue that saturated fats are unhealthy and low-fat diets are optimal, the exact <i>opposite</i> of the thesis of the study and article.<p>Robbins is a dietary extremist and his books make Quackwatch's list of non-recommended books that ""promote misinformation, espouse unscientific theories, and/or contain unsubstantiated advice"" [1]. The National Council Against Health Fraud even had a critical blurb towards his television program about <i>Diet For a New America</i> in their '91 newsletter [2].<p>While I find Campbell's actual research in the china studies important, the book infers much more than the studies showed, not to mention a lack of supporting follow-up studies that control for the most common criticisms (genetics, rates of exercise, comparisons with mostly meat-eating populations without diseases of civilization, etc.). I have a real issue with taking descriptive information from data and turning it into prescriptive advice before accumulating sound evidence. For a good critique, the always awesome SkepDoc Harriet Hall posted a review on the Science-Based Medicine blog (which I highly recommend) [3], although the comments get bogged down about her linking to a similar criticism by the Weston Price foundation.<p>Oddly enough, as a lifelong vegetarian myself, I find myself wanting to agree with these authors and recommending them to others. But it's disheartening these authors feel the need to fortify their ethical choices with shoddy scientific inferences. Yes, following their recommendations will almost certainly lead to better health, but only because those recommendations merely happen to correlate well with a healthier than average diet, not because their assumed causations about optimal health are necessarily correct.<p>However, I do agree with your recommendation for Pollan.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecbooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecbooks.ht...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncahf.org/nl/1991/9-10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncahf.org/nl/1991/9-10.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=385"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=385</a>",1273471941
1333713,comment,1332726,1333687,0,0,10ren,,,"I went to the OmniMax theatre at a sort of Technology park in Singapore (about 20 years ago!). I actually haven't seen one anywhere else; the closest is iMax. Anyway, it was a huge hemisphere, enough to cover a large cinema's worth of people. The seats were tilted back by about 45 degrees.<p>Because my peripheral vision was covered, when the camera tilted, it actually <i>felt</i> like everything was tilting. The movie I saw was taken from a plane, and so this happened whenever it banked. The bandwidth needed was massive - IIRC, they used seven 35mm cameras, and superposed them with seven projectors. The sound was via speakers placed at various locations behind the hemisphere.<p>I've seen a couple of iMax movies (with an extremely large, though flat screen), and the effect doesn't occur. It's a lot more expensive to make a hemispherical cinema, I think. However, I recall a youtube video of a guy doing it within a simple tent (compensating for the corners not being spherical by distorting the image projected).<p>BTW: you make a nice point about considering sensors in the home, but  also consider what sensors it would be great to have, perhaps using yet-to-be invented technology. eg. a sensor that could register the exact 3D contents of a room; or brain activity; or all your sensory input nerves (brain in a tank anyone?); downloadable objects (auto-milling machines - but probably don't require massive bandwidth, unless it was ridiculously high-resolution, say approaching molecular levels - effectively, matter transmission). An interesting constraint is that lag will probably prevent interesting real-time applications.<p>There maybe hybrid applications, eg to progressively download massive hires textures in a MMORPG or sandbox game or games like the videodisk-based <i>Dragon's Lair</i> (I think the limit here is that they are so expensive for artists to produce in the first place - perhaps the breakthrough needed is a way for amateurs to generate excellent/interesting textures? Perhaps consumer HD cameras will do this). Maybe motion capture, as in project natal (but I think the bandwidth needed is pretty low... again the problem is latency).",1273471887

In a problem set class, the exams are typically 50% or more.  For example, in CS103 (learning the basics like proofs, induction, graph theory, set theory, a little complexity, etc.) your grade is 45% psets and 55% exams; in 154 (in-depth complexity), it's 40/60.  In 248 (3d graphics) it's 90% projects, 10% exam.  So even if you get a TA who helps a little too much on psets, you won't get better than a B without understanding the material.",1273471744

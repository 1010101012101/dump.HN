It's hard work, but the reward for getting it right is that you have access to talent all over the world.<p>That said, I think the experience varies based on your situation. I'd be careful signing up to be the first or only remote worker. You'll find you miss out on a lot of the conversations where decisions happen; people can forget to dial you in or bring you up to speed. Don't underestimate how much work you'll have to do to keep the communication flowing. Working remote is a lot easier on a team that has other remote workers.",1325771985

3428636,comment,3428567,3428626,2,0,llambda,,,"I think it can be tricky. We know the process doesn't always work. Some companies, e.g. Google, believe that it's better to adhere to a tough hiring process and reject most people even if a certain number of those people who are rejected may be brilliant engineers. But what I think is important to remember is that the goal is to hire the right person for the job. The hiring process you use may or may not be an effective and efficient means of finding that person. But certainly having a very narrow view, say by having a very strong focus on the process and little else, is a sure way to miss the right person at least some of the time.",1325771727

Perhaps it is largely personality based, but I've always enjoyed it. Deadlines keep me on track and side-projects fill the spare working capacity. So work does get done and, as others have said, more besides.<p>. Productivity is not a problem, especially when you learn to down-tools when you feel you need to, rather than waiting for your set break times. You'll probably find yourself working more efficiently.<p>. Socially you do need to adjust, and make the most of opportunities to meet other freelancers/people where possible. I initially missed the office banter, but less so with time. As with most things, if you accept it will be different and don't resist that, it should be easier.<p>. As mentioned elsewhere, those around you at home will indeed sometimes forget that your body and mind are often separated (i.e. body at home, mind at work). Prepare to have many thought-bubbles burst, unless you have a good home-office solution. A semi-hack for this problem is to simply take more notes.<p>. Energy wise, if you care, I've seen studies for and against the savings made by remote working. Heating 25 whole houses in winter compared to a single office, for instance, doesn't guarantee an energy reduction. But then there would be 25 times less CO2 emissions. Swings and roundabouts. Never really been a key issue for me, but perhaps worth consideration.<p>I'm now moving into a more involved 'startup-style' phase this year, with no deadlines to keep me on track and no team around me I'm going to have to adapt to a new style of remote working.

DOSBox on OSX cannot open EXE files directly and OSX has no concept of application shortcuts: so you cannot just right-click->Open With on EXE files to launch them, or set up shortcuts for your games that pass different startup parameters to DOSBox, like you can in Windows.<p>Instead, to launch a game with a custom configuration file (pretty much a necessity if you have more than one game you want to play) means typing in the following lovely command in the terminal:<p>/Applications/DOSBox.app/Contents/MacOS/DOSBox -conf /path/to/my/game/config.conf<p>...each time, or learning Applescript or bash scripting in order to write your own launcher script for each game to run the appropriate commands. That, on top of learning DOSBox's config file and mount syntax so you can write the configuration files each game needs. Needless to say, this is way too much work for the majority of would-be users on the Mac, even those who have a working knowledge of MS-DOS.<p>Users who overcome that learning curve still have to contend with things that simply <i>don't work at all</i> in the DOSBox OSX build: like swapping one physical CD for another while playing (DOSBox keeps the CD busy so it can't eject, and the new CD would be at the wrong path anyway), or using fullscreen mode in OS X 10.7 (broken in DOSBox 0.74), or using Tandy emulation mode on a PowerPC mac (graphics glitches galore) or pausing the game (the default pause key doesn't exist on a Mac keyboard, and even if you rebind it the emulator will not unpause once paused) and so on and so on.<p>Boxer doesn't just provide added value; it provides a usable DOS emulator for the Mac in the first place.",1325769933

I was one of their more productive developers, so I asked them to let me work from home. They <i>sort of</i> went for it: they agreed to two days in the office, three at home. I really enjoyed those three days at home, and I was way more productive. I eventually had to quit that place, because it just got too horrible, but I've been trying to get another remote job ever since. In the last few months, I finally succeeded.<p>I got myself hooked up with a contracting company. They find iOS jobs for me to do, then subcontract my time to other companies. And I get to work from home 100 percent. I had to take a severe pay cut to make it happen, but for me, it's worth it.<p>I enjoy that I can make a better environment for myself than any office I've ever worked in. I have lots of space, a window, a door that closes, and a huge Apple monitor. A whole bunch of quality-of-life things I couldn't ever convince employers to give me. I can take an hour off here or there to take a nap or walk the dog. And there's no commute. Eventually, I can move somewhere cheap, to make the most of my income. This is the life for me.<p>I admit that there are inherent communication problems. As other people have mentioned, you have to be a fiercely determined self-starter to make this work. But looking back on it now, the stuff typical employers expect you to go through -- for me, there is no comparison. You'll have to pry my remote job from my cold, dead fingers.",1325769476

But unless they can also keep the battery life up people aren't going to shift to them.<p>And then there's form factor.  My Kobo e-reader sits handily in my coat pocket, and there's no way a 10"" tablet is going to do that.  The Kindle Touch is 17cm by 12cm, and that's pretty much perfect for reading novels.  It's not perfect for reading comics on, or watching videos - for that I'd rather have at least a 10"" screen.<p>So I suspect that convergence just isn't going to happen - we're going to be left with a range of devices - 3-4"" phones, 6-7"" tablet/ereaders and 10"" tablets for video.",1325769469

George Dantzig came late to class one day and saw two problems on the blackboard. He worked them, not knowing that his professor had posted them as examples of unsolved research problems, NOT homework. That impressed his professor and helped launch his career.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dantzig"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dantzig</a><p><a href=""http://www.snopes.com/college/homework/unsolvable.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snopes.com/college/homework/unsolvable.asp</a><p><a href=""http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Dantzig_George.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Dant...</a>",1238258648

536552,comment,536413,536413,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The reason everyone seems to have NPD is because the people judging aren't trained psychologists or psychiatrists.<p>People confuse egocentrism (self-centeredness) with narcissism. Many people are considered egocentric today because of only-child syndrome, when you don't get taught how to get along with others when you're young then you're likely to end up egocentric.<p>NPD is only present in 1% of people, but is generally higher in clinical tests. Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) presents 3% in males and 1% in females. So it's actually very unlikely one of your close friends would actually have this disorder.<p>Most people carry some traits of NPD, but it's all relative.

536545,comment,536485,536485,0,0,Raplh,,,"In my first year of graduate school, I was wondering ""HOW can I do something creative?""  It seemed an impossible problem.  How do you come up with something which would startle you with its newness if somebody else showed it to you as something they came up with?<p>The solution I hit upon which moved me forward was this: research problems are homework problems.  You could give me a homework problem I had never solved before, and I would work diligently on it.  I was not deterred by the fact that I had never answered this homework problem before because I knew SOMEBODY had answered this homework problem before.<p>A Research Problem was just a Homework Problem asked for the first time.  BEFORE the first person to do it had ever done it.  With this attitude, I was able to work on a problem with the artificial belief that OF COURSE it could be done, and so I should stick to it until I had done it.  The belief was artificial because, in the case of a research problem, it had NOT been done before.<p>Once I got used to working on research problems it was totally better than homework.  No longer was I interested in homework, but only in these incredible investigations that hadn't been done before.<p>I should add that I wouldn't have even vaguely understood the questions if I wasn't on a daily basis exposed to great research.",1238257685

There's no history for it.  There's no good reason for it.  It's just stupid and ugly.  If someone forked PHP tomorrow and changed just that one thing for now I'd probably use the fork.

The classic textbook case of the Irish potato famine was always difficult (if not impossible) to prove, but this is apparently some evidence of the existence of Giffen goods.<p>Link:

237693,comment,237544,237544,0,0,froo,,,"Further expanding on what you've done there, what about doing ""mood avatars"" based off tweets? Essentially a mashup of Twistori/Tweetsnap?<p>What I'm thinking basically is, people can upload their normal avatars to your site, which you use as the backdrop for your image.. and based off emotions that they tweet (love, hate etc) it can overlay a translucent colour on it?<p>So in effect, changing the mood of someone's avatar, based off their Tweets?<p>Just a thought :)",1215330636

237691,comment,237180,237180,0,0,alexk,,,"So true, I worked in telecom industry on the voice mail servers and the irony was that I never used the services that developed. From my point of view the biggest problem with voice interface - it's too heavy, it takes too much time to navigate all these voice menu's listen to the message from start and the inability to filter and manipulate the information. Voicemail is dead. At least in the form that we have now.",1215329710

I call it the macbook pro a month program :)  So, about 30k/year, and about 5k of that is tax deductible (iirc).  Misplaced parental guilt?  Not really - it's just tough to find good care in the bay area for a low price without enduring a huge waiting list.",1215329105

237679,comment,237531,237531,0,0,froo,,,"Voting rings definitely exist in on news recommendation sites.<p>For example, take Digg (I'm expecting to get downmodded for even mentioning this name btw) - you get people shouting within their circle of friends to get stories voted up, so that functionality is essentially built into the system.
You also have the opposite true aswell, people banding together to downvote stories too and it happens often enough that theres a term for it ""bury brigades""<p>offtopic:
I think I might need to get glasses, I originally thought the title was ""Clams in news recommendation site?""",1215328355

And indeed, making ends meet is exactly what happens if they ever try to buy a house (forget about owning > 1400 sq. ft. in a good school district with even double that income).",1215328246

237673,comment,237544,237544,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"The link you generate shoots back tweetsnap. People might want it to point to their twitter stream. This is an interesting tradeoff between what people would want and what will make this spread.<p>I think the solution is to make the tweetsnap link have a link to the user's twitter stream. For example:<p><pre><code>  <a href=""http://tweetsnap/twitter/tipjoy"">
  <img alt=""Tipjoy"" src=""http://tweetsnap.com/twitter/show/tipjoy.png"" />
  </a>
</code></pre>
The href leads to a page that shows the same form to make your own tweetsnap widget, but the page could have a side bar that grabs the last few tweets from @tipjoy and a link to <a href=""http://twitter.com/tipjoy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/tipjoy</a>",1215327608

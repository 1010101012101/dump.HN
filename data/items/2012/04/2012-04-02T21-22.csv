Yes, it's very complicated, and if one doesn't have a complete understanding, problems can arise.<p><i>When in the signal handler itself, the list of libc functions it is safe to call is small; the Single UNIX specification only guarantees less than 120 functions.</i><p>I don't think this is precisely accurate. I think it's safe to call libc functions anywhere, but the point is that you have to ensure that non-reentrant functions are not called simultaneously by the same thread.<p>One way to do that is to never call those functions in a signal handler, but if you really know what you're doing (i.e., you know the signal hanlder is not interrupting the function you want to call), you can call it in the signal handler.<p>Does this sound right?

For example, cheap desalination means water for drought-struck Saharan Africans; cheap food saves lives worldwide; cheap computing leads to the situation we have today. ""Moving money around"" is not valueless by itself; that is, after all, what banks (and even currency itself) exist to accomplish, and manage to scrape by at it.<p>But again, taking your position at face value, I would counter that the level of expertise needed to maintain the data needs of most people is very modest compared to the level of expertise needed to sell everyone that amount of data at scale. If your needs are not dramatic (and most people's aren't) then ""the cloud"" may turn out to be more expensive than doing it yourself on top of the usual downsides of outsourcing. Not everybody has a scalability problem. And if you do have a scalability problem but your income is directly proportional to the scale, it may be cheaper to run it yourself anyway and hire those scalability experts. There are more cloud providers every year, not fewer, and Amazon and Google did it out of necessity and made a profit long before they realized they could monetize it.<p>In short, I think there are arguments for and against, like everything else, and people should understand the upsides and the downsides before choosing. Once the pendulum swings back there will be people leaving the cloud who probably should be there and I'll be arguing for them to use it, but for right now it seems like the herd is recklessly choosing the cloud without understanding why.",1333403777

I usually raise eyebrows, even from colleagues, when I mention that I started programming at the age of 8.<p>Of course, times were different back then. You had a computer that booted straight into Basic. You didn't need to install anything, register anything or even open up an editor. The prompt was your editor.<p>All I knew back then was that there was this prompt and this manual. You typed commands, and the computer would reply with something (at first, just 'Syntax Error'). Then I discovered conditionals (and called my parents to show off).  And got an assignment from my father - he wanted me to draw a grid that he could use to calibrate TV sets (TV was the standard display device for personal computers). I did it, after working for most of an afternoon. Some time later, I discovered the 'for' loop (or rather, finally understood what it was for) and rewrote all of it in 5 minutes and 4 lines. And the rest is history.<p>EDIT: Even more impressive is that the author managed to keep himself focused and finished the job. At 15, I had already started the trend that would lead to a huge string of corpses of unfinished projects.",1333403573

Joyent Cloud is partnering with Nodejitsu to provide a new Node.js development environment that improves on Joyents existing no.de service. You can sign up for the new service by clicking here.<p>Below is an FAQ explaining what this partnership means. Thanks for reading!<p>Q: Can you explain the Joyent Cloud / Nodejitsu partnership? What does this mean?<p>A: Joyent Cloud and Nodejitsu are partnering to deliver a Node.js development environment that will leverage the development and management tools of Nodejitsu and the Joyent Cloud infrastructure to deliver high-performance Node.js applications. Nodejitsu will run a significant part of its infrastructure on the Joyent Cloud. This will provide a superior continuum for Node.js apps spanning development, test and production phases of an application life cycle.<p>Q: I have an no.de account. How does this new arrangement affect me?<p>A: The new arrangement does not affect you whatsoever. You can still use your existing no.de account as outlined under the Terms of Service of the free program. While we think those who check out the new Nodejitsu development environment will want to switch over from no.de immediately, we do not have plans to make changes to the no.de service at this time.<p>Q: I want an no.de account but couldn't get one before because the system was over capacity. Can I get one now?<p>A: You won't be able to get a no.de account, but developers wishing to access a full-featured Node.js development sandbox should sign up for the new Nodejitsu / Joyent service.<p>Q: How do I move from the no.de environment to the Nodjitsu environment?<p>A: All Node.js code deployed in no.de should run equally well in the new Nodejitsu sandbox. If users are on no.de v2, the only significant changes are the switch from git push to jitsu deploy, Nodejitsus deployment tool. Jitsu deploy will walk you through all necessary changes configuration changes. For more information on how to use jitsu deploy, click here.<p>Best Regards,

The basic argument is that any tool that may be used to track work performance (such as a tool tracking user errors) may be abused to control the employees work and thus may need union approval. I've run into this issue multiple times when doing work for government or government-like institutions in germany, once in pretty much the same constellation: A tool for defect tracking in IT was shot down because the union was afraid that it might be used to single out low-performing employees by tracking their computer problems.

Signals can come in and interrupt kernel system calls--this is what EINTR is there for.  When in the signal handler itself, the list of libc functions it is safe to call is small; the Single UNIX specification only guarantees less than 120 functions.  V7 signals are not reliable and so it is dangerous to be in the signal handler for an extended period of time; but even BSD and SysV reliable signals have a list of caveats as long as my arm.  The synchronous (think SIGFPE or SIGSEGV)/asynchronous (think SIGINT) distinction is an additional complication that the interface needed like it needed an additional head.  And I haven't even gotten into the interactions between signals and process groups.  Basically signals are a primitive, crude and dangerous form of IPC that one is nonetheless obligated to pay attention to.<p>As a rule of thumb I generally prefer to use signal handlers to set a small amount of global data and nothing else, and have the main interrupt loop notice and deal with the condition.

For most of my high school and early undergrad, I spent a lot of time being frustrated by ""intuitive"" examples that people used to give me which didn't really make sense at a fundamental level and seemed to be attempts at handwaving away the problems I had. It's only when I started learning more abstract mathematics did I really start having fun and seeking out how to create my own intuitions for things.",1333400759

It was on my computer at work for 5 years, and at home the entire time.<p>But the article has a point, and it is something that made me switch to Windows last year. The problem is that it never works perfectly. I am not so much talking about the desktop, although I have suffered through my share of broken Gnome and KDE desktops. The problem is the driver situation.<p>I started my own business last year and needed a computer to work on. The Dell laptop I purchased is great, except<p>- The wireless network did not work
- Bluetooth did not work
- The video camera did not work
- The mic did not work
- The SD card slot did not work
- The touch pad's scroll area did not work<p>I worked on these problems for a few months, and I fixed many, but finally I had it. My conclusion was that while much of the software in the Linux ecosystem steadily improves, other parts continuously breaks, and it will remain that way. The experimentation with the desktops I could live with, but the  driver situation is another matter. I am too old to spend hours and hours patching the distribution to support the hardware I have.<p>I love Linux - and my intent was to use it in Virtualbox under Windows. I reasoned that Windows will have the driver support, and Virtualbox will deliver a sane hardware interface for Linux. But Windows 7 works well enough for me, so in practise I don't start Virtualbox often at all.<p>I don't think I will return to Linux running on the bare metal. But I will always bring the skills I learned with me, and I expect them to last me for decades.",1333400679

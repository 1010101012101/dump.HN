I grew suspicious when he talked about speed being partly due to the processor, when we've all known since we got SSDs that the processor has nothing to do with UI latency (when was the last time you saw CPU usage spiking to 100% just by launching programs)?<p>The disk has always been the bottleneck, Apple was smart enough to put a fast disk in the Air, and now this guy praises it.<p>This computer loads faster than the MBP because you've spent the past 6 months loading it with programs, guy. Format the MacBook Pro and it will be just as fast... Sure, the Air might be a great little computer, but for a $999 pricetag, I could get 3 netbooks instead.",1288097952

1833983,comment,1833727,1833727,0,0,listic,,,"I hate the fact that tech companies and observers gloss over the technical details of products. On Apple's site, even in the sections labeled ""Tech Specs"" you cannot find the model of CPU, chipset or hard drive that goes into any of their product (except for Mac Pro, and there you don't have much choice even though I guess it should be expected with the desktop computer of such class). And the reviewers often times make no effort to find that out too! What kind of ""technical"" is this?<p>It seems to me they use Core 2 Duo SL9400 (1.87 GHz, 1066 FSB)(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_2_microprocessors#.22Penryn.22_.28low-voltage.2C_45_nm.2C_Small_Form_Factor.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_2_microproce...</a>). Not exactly record-setting for low power, judging by 17W TDP, but when everyone is measuring battery life at mostly idle CPU, and with process enhancements over the years (I heard that later Core 2's of the same model consume less power than rated) I think they might show close to their rated battery life. I think Apple must have worked hard squeezing the unnecessary volume and weight with the new design to give place for more battery too.",1288097886

I always wonder why people hated on Flash ads so much and supported HTML5... when the truth was, HTML5 and tech would allow companies to do essentially the same thing.  Except now instead of just disabling Flash, you'd have to disable... what?<p>Basically, the benefit of HTML5 and associated technologies (seriously, that's getting annoying fast, maybe I should just rename it Superior HTML5 and Integrated Technologies, and shorten that to... nm) is simple that you'll be able to run ""Flash like things"" without a plug-in.<p>Everything Flash can do, browsers will be able to do by default.

1833964,comment,1831838,1833221,0,0,saurik,,,"To your ""first"", I continue to state: that could be handled in a library. There is no reason why this is better handled inside rather than outside of the database. Insisting that this be provided by the database vendor instead of as a layer on top, however, means that you are now taking an entire backend storage implementation (one that is incredibly touchy, I will mind you: I've been using MongoDB in production for the last eight months and I now consider myself an idiot for having wasted time with it) from someone because they provided a convenient syntax.<p>To your ""second"": that is not a property of your usage of trees, and starts a new, unrelated discussion. I have nothing against document-oriented databases, and use them often. I feel you are blurring the line between syntax and implementation with your ""slow"" comment (again: if you are able to concurrently update those schema-less data items you are going to be taking the same hit you would be getting with any other backend for the separate storage and indexing), but will certainly not argue that there are classes of problems where document-oriented databases are really useful.

Knowing C certainly helps to understand that repetitive array size and index access is likely to be more expensive than using local variables. At the same time C programmer is more likely to adopt an imperative programming style, which is in this case more error prone, verbose and doesn't allow for code re-use.<p>More ideomatic JavaScript would look like this:<p><pre><code>    Array.prototype.foreach = function (f) {\n       for (var i = 0, _i = this.length; i < _i; i++) f(this[i])\n    }\n\n\n    /** BEGIN **/\n    var f = new Array(3000000);\n    console.time(1);\n    f.foreach( function (el) {\n           if (el === 'foobar' ||\n               el === 'foobaz' ||\n               el === 'baz' ||\n               el === 'barfoo')  // Do something\n\n    })\n    console.timeEnd(1);\n    /** END **/</code></pre>",1288097429

Because I like the way a MacBook looks and feels!<p>While that might be a perfectly valid reason for buying the 300€ more expensive coffee table that doesn’t seem to work with computers and I honestly don’t know why.

I can understand that some people prefer to only look at the specs and they should probably not buy any computer from Apple. I’m like that with some other things, too.

Then there is freedom to tinker, the price difference and matching deployment/server OS.

Forget your idea.""<p>You have some undefined but clearly confused, obscure, and highly negative conception or definition of an ""idea"". Such an ""idea"" is irrelevant, so let's set it aside.<p>The definition of a relevant 'idea' is one that enables, permits, or says how to solve ""a critical problem"".  Or curing some deadly variety of cancer is ""a critical problem"", and an important ""idea"" would be how to do that.<p>Or, much of the REASON a ""critical problem"" still needs to be solved is that finding an idea good enough to solve the problem is too hard.<p>So, if we are attacking what is clearly ""a critical problem"", then the ""idea"" DOES ""matter"" and is crucial -- the idea needs to be GOOD, and finding it will likely be hard.<p>In denigrating an ""idea"", you appear to have bought into some common nonsense, especially spread by Guy Kawasaki, that ""ideas are easy; execution is hard"". Wrong, wrong, way WRONG, Guy.<p>Here Guy likes to insult, denigrate, and run down entrepreneurs, and that is common on his side of the table.  Or, that side of the table likes to claim that much of what the other side of the table has is worthless.<p>Actually, GOOD ideas are HARD, and, then, execution is routine.  BELIEVE ME, if you have a GOOD idea for curing some deadly variety of cancer, then the idea was hard, hard enough that so far some thousands of well funded, very serious biomedical researchers have missed it for some decades, and execution is routine, or many patients and their families and physicians will be knocking your door down as the last chance not to die yet.<p>Yes, with an easy idea, execution will likely be hard.<p>A charitable explanation for saying<p>""Your idea doesn't matter.""<p>or<p>""ideas are easy; execution is hard""<p>is that someone really just has not even a weak little hollow hint of a tiny clue about what constitutes a GOOD idea or how to find one and to know that it is good; but there are ways to do these things:  The work is essentially 'research', and the education for it is called the Ph.D. The all-time, unique world-class, grand champion for such ideas is the US DoD, and the NIH is not far behind.  So, thankfully for US national security, the US DoD, and thankfully for US health care, the NIH, have for decades identified GOOD ideas and pursued them with high effectiveness.<p>A good DoD example is GPS.  Yes it started as 'just an idea', but it was backed by some quite solid mathematical physics that permitted evaluating the idea.  The 'idea', and actually nearly every good idea pursued by the DoD, is presented and evaluated first just on paper.  So, in such work, the concepts of 'traction', prototypes, 'product-market fit', pivoting, etc. are all just silly; instead, the project gets evaluated just on paper long before 'traction', etc.<p>We CAN present and evaluate good ideas just on paper; learning how is much of why we go to school; that's part of what Ph.D. people do.<p>Uh, here's the little secret:  It is human nature for people to run out of money.<p>Or, 'the story of America is rags to rags in three generations'.<p>Or, suppose tough, hard working, determined Joe from the wrong side of the tracks builds a company worth $800 million and then falls over dead from a heart attack and/or overwork.  So, after the lawyers get their pieces, Joe's son Tom takes over the company.  Too soon, via ignorance, simplistic thinking, lack of hard work and determination, high maintenance, fast women, slow horses, fast cars, nasty divorces, liquid pleasure, funny, smoky stuff, weekends in Vegas, Tom has the company losing money.<p>So, the other family members, seeing that they might have to go to work instead of just suck at the teat left by Joe, contact a private equity (PE) firm that agrees to buy 80% of the company for $40 million.  Tom gets to 'pursue other interests'.<p>The PE firm brings just basic responsible business management, nothing more, cuts out the nonsense, gets the company worth $600 million, and sells it.<p>Why?  Human nature.  There are only a few people like Joe and a lot of people like Tom.<p>So, what about 'venture capital' (VC)?  PE with a twist:  Again much of the key is that commonly people run out of money.  So, a VC firm can say that they are looking for passionate, visionary, etc. entrepreneurs.  Why?  Because the startup CEO is eager enough to see himself as passionate, visionary, etc. and because the VC firm wants the CEO to believe that VC firm is investing in the 'visionary', etc. CEO, his 'disruptive idea', 'secret sauce', etc.<p>The VC firm is just doing a routine manipulation; they are emphasizing the sizzle and not the steak.  The VC firm is just looking at a way they can buy low and sell high, and their main way is that the CEO, as is human nature, ran short on money.  It also helps if the CEO and his team are a bit naive, gullible, and easily manipulated.<p>Keeping money is hard.  Building a valuable business, including finding the good idea, is hard, and keeping the business is also hard.  There are lots of ways to throw money away that are not seen by poor people but make themselves known to rich people!  Anyone who both made a lot of money and kept it avoided many opportunities to lose the money.<p>In particular the VC firm (I'm assuming information technology not biomedical technology) cares not at all about 'the idea', the 'secret sauce', etc. and will refuse (and, really, is nearly totally unable -- they are commonly just history majors, and only a tiny fraction of VC partners have any serious technical qualifications) even to evaluate it and, instead, just looks for some simple numbers:  The main numbers are ComScore numbers and their rate of growth.  That is, they look for 'traction'.  Or, good traction and a good 'idea' are nearly as good as just good traction alone.  Or the future value of the business and the idea are conditionally independent given the traction.<p>Why do the VCs do this?  Because they, and their limited partners, understand and trust in human nature MUCH more than in technology or secret sauce.<p>It remains:  For a successful business, the idea is just CRUCIAL.  Yes, it is essentially true that the idea matters only to the founders and not to the VCs, but still the idea is crucial.  That VCs ignore ideas is just that they have (or at least have had until the losses of the last 10 years, and still hope to have) a way to make money easier for them and that they and their limited partners do understand -- exploit human nature and take advantage of gullible CEOs.<p>Or, rule out everything else and what remains, however improbable, must be the truth!<p>For reading Tech Crunch, HN, blogs, Fred Wilson, etc., that is very thin and watery material, much of it very wrong, but a little of it is worth knowing.<p>For<p>""There is no secret to startup success.""<p>of COURSE there is:  Else success is all just blind luck (which we can't believe) or many more people would be rich.<p>For<p>""there are no repeatable patterns that lead to startup success.  None.""<p>yes there are, but, of course, they are difficult to see.  The US DoD sees them, and so does nearly all of the applied research community, but nearly no one in information technology entrepreneurship does.<p>Yes, even though there are repeatable patterns, not all successes will fit any such patterns.<p>Actually, when looking for exceptional events, which, of course, successes are, empirical distributions and averages are not very important.<p>So, as is common, the more important 'intelligence' about such things is beyond empirical distributions.  Or, that Langley fell into the Potomac and that many others had failed for many decades didn't mean that the Wright Brothers had to fail.<p>How did the Wright Brothers know?  They designed and built a good wind tunnel, did good lift, drag, and thrust calculations, and made good progress on the crucial issues of three axis control.  So their 'pattern' was to take advantage of some basic physics.  Sadly they did not understand Reynolds number so had two thin wings instead of one thick one.<p>The pattern remains:  There are ways to know.<p>For your<p>""just f<i></i>*ing do it (#JFDI).""<p>no:  You are proposing just blind, passionate irrationality.  Instead, plan well enough to see your way fairly clear to success; then measure twice and saw once.  Or have a carefully worked out flight plan WITH reserve fuel and alternate destinations.  Charles Lindberg did.  Of course, if you have no way to see your way clear to success, then you will have to proceed with just blind passion.<p>Even Fred Wilson will advise, quoting roughly, ""If you don't need venture capital, then you shouldn't take it.""",1288095385

1833855,comment,1811294,1821531,0,0,mfukar,,,"You make an interesting case, which I think is backed up by two things, in the special case of the x86 instruction set:<p>- Instruction opcodes and arguments don't occupy a fixed space or position. This leads to a significant increase in lethality of mutations. Some other factors that contribute to this is the large instruction set, and the fact that opcodes and arguments are directly connected (context-specific). Straight-up GA does provably not perform well, unless there's a meta-language involved, as the article shows. I'd dare say this is very close to Koza's approach, and it also seems to be close to Michael Korns' approach, which is more recent.<p>- ""Instruction set"" put aside, mutations in a x86 system (or in any other computing environment, for that matter) happens on a bit granularity. The sort of natural redundancy that would allow GA to operate on a sufficient population for robust mutations to appear is not there, without a metalanguage. (even ECC in memory tends to not be favoured, so resistance against bit flips, ie. point mutations)<p>Also, it seems to me that without a ""natural"" redundancy mechanism within an instruction set, it is impossible for other types of mutations, namely deletion/insertion/duplication, to produce survivable offspring. As a (probably not very good) metaphor one should consider what would happen to aminoacids if we were to consider codons as their building blocks (disregarding nucleotides).",1288095223

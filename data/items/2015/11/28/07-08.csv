The lesson should be to charge a reasonable amount for your work, and let the purchaser do whatever they want with it.<p>At least in the U.S., the First-sale doctrine[0] is very important, enabling things like libraries and re-selling things you purchase.

They believed that wage workers were &quot;neither wronged nor oppressed&quot;. Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans argued that the condition of wage workers was different from slavery, as laborers were likely to have the opportunity to work for themselves in the future, achieving self-employment. The abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass initially declared, &quot;now I am my own master&quot;, upon taking a paying job. But later in life, he concluded to the contrary, &quot;experience demonstrates that there may be a slavery of wages only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery, and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other&quot;. Douglass went on to speak about these conditions as arising from the unequal bargaining power between the ownership/capitalist class and the non-ownership/laborer class within a compulsory monetary market. &quot;No more crafty and effective devise for defrauding the southern laborers could be adopted than the one that substitutes orders upon shopkeepers for currency in payment of wages. It has the merit of a show of honesty, while it puts the laborer completely at the mercy of the land-owner and the shopkeeper.&quot;.</i><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery</a>",1448697282

10640407,comment,10638795,10639408,0,0,vacri,,,"> <i>Movies cost tens of millions to make and employ hundreds if not thousands.</i><p>Couldn&#x27;t have put it better myself: movies are a pretty small part of the economy, despite the spectacle. Box office takings in the US in 2014 were only about $10B in total - that&#x27;s really not that big an industry, and high tech in particular eats those numbers for breakfast (insubstantial things like Instagram get bought for $1B, for example). Even if you throw in licensing and merchandising, it doesn&#x27;t move the needle all that much.<p>Some comparative examples from other industries - the NYC Port Authority budget for 2015 was about $8B in size; Lowe&#x27;s hardware has about a $50B turnover annually; the University of Pittsburgh had $2B in revenue for 2014; John Deere had $40B in revenue in 2013. All of these are single-company examples from larger industries, but the numbers give some context to the actual economic oomph of Hollywood.<p>And not only that, but when you see a movie and see all those names scroll by at the end? Those folks aren&#x27;t all in full-time jobs. It&#x27;s not like a movie keeps all the employees in permanent full-time employment. Most of the money that movies make <i>don&#x27;t</i> go to employing people, but to the profiteers at the top.<p>So, in short, movies don&#x27;t make that much money in context, and aren&#x27;t the wide-ranging employers you&#x27;re painting them as. They do however make a lot of noise and have an unbelievable amount of political power, given their relative lack of economic might. We don&#x27;t see Lowe&#x27;s pressuring the government to enact treaties on their behalf...<p>> <i>I guess &quot;move fast and break things&quot; is a great motto until it&#x27;s your stuff getting broken.</i><p>Ah, you&#x27;re right. SV should enhance its integrity by adopting the moral values of Hollywood...",1448697107

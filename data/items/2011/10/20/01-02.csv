3132999,comment,3132513,3132920,2,0,twainer,,,"Agreed. That piece reads a bit too much like a HuffPost 'article'.<p>The idea that industrial workers' skills would become obsolete is not only wrong, it's also an idea that far predates Drucker. The skills aren't obsolete as much as they are under competition from previously unreachable pools of labor in other parts of the world.<p>As the comment above notes, a real problem with income distribution in American society comes more from a tax code that allows/favors corporations over small businesses and passive income over income derived from labor of any sort. This is not just about money - it is about personal control.<p>It isn't even enough to compare wages; the picture is much worse when one considers personal debt load in relation to earnings. What emerges then is really two parallel countries - rapidly drifting apart. On one hand you have the wealthy and super-wealthy insulated from economic shock and personal debt. On the other hand you have a class of people who seem 'middle-class' but who are in hock for housing and education and stand a small distance away - a job loss, a serious illness - from disaster. Earnings supported the birth of the middle-class in post-war America but, sadly, it is only debt that has sustained it.<p>That kind of state-within-a-state is not unique to post-industrial economies at all - which makes the author's closing opinion rubbish.  That situation - whether in Russia or Brazil or Colombia or even Israel - is much more a result of social and economic policies and the OWS group is instinctively correct in feeling like such policies are not in their favor.",1319074879

Your point is that, if Google didn't ""cut these corners"", this free product may very well not exist, and thus unable to provide these benefits to the developing world at low cost.<p>Which is, again, a non-sequitor, since there is no evidence whatsoever that Google treats Android like an exercise in budget engineering for the developing world. They are banking practically the whole company on it, and throwing top talent at Android, with a seemingly bottomless budget.<p>Suffice it to say, if Google spent some more time optimizing and improving UI responsiveness, the developing world will not suffer, and in fact will get a better product for the same price they're currently paying: $0.<p>This is the same stupid argument that people used with Nokia years ago, before (surprise!) Android came in and ate their lunch. Those budget candy bar phones sure did bring mobile telephony to the masses, and any attempt at critiquing the phones' hardware or software was rebuked with claims of ""well if it was better it wouldn't be affordable you elitist"".<p>And of course, then Google came in with Android and now we have touchscreen smartphones in the developing world.

Salesforce and others have been aggressive in pursuing this (chatter, et al). Would/will be a big differentiator for Google.<p>3. Additionally, apps wasn't always so aggressively positioned for just business and personal use. Early on it was very poorly positioned (looking back at some of the early how-to posts shows lots of ""what exactly is google apps for your domain"" type posts).

If it's a page full of comments about guitars, stick a Stratocaster ad on it and be done.  The Internet was supposed to be about freedom and personal expression.  I used to scoff at things like Second Life and people on BBSes with ridiculously fake avatars, but now we have the horrors of everyday life invading and taking over the ""virtual"" space, which is less and less virtual every day.  Even the visual and auditory carnage of MySpace was preferable to the cookie-cutter sameness of Facebook, helpfully tracking your every single move before you even think to make it, and broadcasting the mundane minutiae of everyday existence to all your ""friends"".<p>I used to love Google when it first came out, it beat the pants off Alta Vista and it was a fantastic way to extract cool links from the vastness of the 'net.  Now people log on to +1 each other on all the right topics and say all the right things and fit themselves into all the right pigeonholes.  What if you want to go online not to maintain your identity as it is now, but to explore new ones?  What if you need more than one identity?

I am so grateful to have been considered and we learned so much from the experience. It certainly helped us to refine our product and it provided deeper motivation to succeed. So in these ways, it means a lot, of course. But does it serve as an indicator for the potential of the product?",1319072840

I love my smartphone (Galaxy S2!) because it lets me read my Google Reader and Kindle on the go. But if you don't like the experience of reading on the screen, I can see how its perceived usefulness will diminish.<p>Smartphone utility is probably also strongly correlated with time spent away from a laptop. I rarely use my smartphone at work or at home, but I tend to spend most of my time out and about on the weekends, so access to email, IM and Maps while out of the house is worth the price of admission. You are never out of touch, you can find the address/directions to anything, from anywhere, anytime.<p>Then add on camera, Facebook, Yelp for finding restaurants, Yahoo Fantasy Football app, Evernote for keeping workout logs and saving commonly run queries and I'm pretty much in love. But as always, YMMV.",1319072744

6735088,comment,6733843,6733843,24,0,aridiculous,,,"Reasoning from first principles is ahistorical, and that is why it so rarely works in the real world. Political and social constructs inherited through time (like, say, the law) will butt heads against a &quot;pure&quot; new solution. You need the resources (and determination, will, etc) to overpower colossal systems we&#x27;ve arrived at through the progression of history.<p>If you&#x27;re going to hit homeruns like Musk, I think you must &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; like he does. But he has resources to fight those battles, and you -- probably -- don&#x27;t. When he didn&#x27;t have those significant resources, like when he started Paypal from first principles, he had an entire cultural shift as his economic lever: he was only able to compete in the online banking and credit card industry because it was an Internet wild west.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that reasoning from first principles is the right first step for someone with no assets now that the internet has legal and corporate oversight swimming through it. But what do I know :P",1384459170

You seem very open to the idea that more public infrastructure needs to be built.<p>I think the first steps that we need to make are towards making the lack of public infrastructure feel more painful to the new implants. We need to do away with the private bus fleets and perhaps explore policies that would limit private and quasi-private modes of transportation like cabs, limos and car &quot;shares&quot;.<p>Cities without any public infrastructure are terrible places to live and work in. We need to stop making &quot;privatization&quot; such an unarguable positive in the tech community. It is at ends with the needs of a population the lives practically on top of itself.<p>I&#x27;m all for the supposed decentralized and sharing-based economics of services like Lyft, but we can&#x27;t forget that these are not democratic institutions. If we are intending to wholesale replace our existing methods of public transportation with something like this, we need to make sure that we retain public oversight in the matter.

It&#x27;s more accurate to say that the military had rockets in development, and they were pressed into service for the new space agency.<p>From 1945 to 1957, the US military (Army, and later, Air Force) was sponsoring rocket development, e.g. von Braun&#x27;s team in Huntsville.  But after NASA was created in 1958 following Sputnik, it was made a civilian agency, and the crossover with the military was much less.<p>NASA doesn&#x27;t have a genuine connection to ICBMs.  There&#x27;s a lot more to space technology than rocketry, so there&#x27;s little overlap between an ICBM (at the whole system level) and an earth-orbiter (again, considered as a system).  For instance, one of the main ICBM design issues is target accuracy -- there&#x27;s no such counterpart for an orbiter.<p>Additionally, divergence between NASA goals and military goals is great enough that, even when prompted from above, the technology does not mix well.  I&#x27;m thinking of the notion that the Shuttle would be used for military/intelligence satellite launch, and the NPOESS combined NOAA/NASA/DoD earth-observing satellite.<p>The notion that there is a DoD &quot;minder&quot; in the back room seems kind of fanciful.  In the late 1950s, maybe, but by the mid-60s -- I really doubt it -- except for some of the basic rocket engine technology.",1384458850

6734984,comment,6733388,6733943,2,0,madhusudancs,,,"Actually, I think this is not exactly a circle. The reason why we moved Databases to separate machines for performance was we did not understand how to schedule tasks or jobs.<p>Also, it comes from the age old debate of whether an Operating System is sufficient to perform a certain type of resource management function or should the application which knows about its own semantics build its own resource manager. One popular incarnation of this is Michael Stonebraker&#x27;s paper on &quot;Operating system support for database management&quot; - <a href=""http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~margo/cs165/papers/stonebraker-81.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~margo/cs165/papers/stonebraker-...</a> where he discusses if Database management systems should builds its own buffer/caching mechanism or those mechanisms provided by filesystems are good enough. This can be extended to the problem in question now, which is about scheduling of jobs on a huge cluster seen as a single computer.<p>One of the major reasons (of many others) why we moved Databases to separate machines was because OSes did a bad job at scheduling tasks. Rather than saying bad, I think I should say that it is difficult for the operating systems to understand the types of workloads. However, in this particular case, Google knows a lot more about its workloads and hence can do a better job at scheduling them on the same machine.<p>Also, it is very important to note that Google has been able to do this because they run 1000s of machines next to each other and everything is distributed. If they can&#x27;t schedule a task on a particular machine because it is overloaded, they always have the choice of scheduling that task on a next machine in the rack. This may not be the case for most people outside Google. If they are using a single machine to host both the database and the computation itself and if for some reason that machine is already running at its peak, there is no other option than making the tasks to be scheduled wait, because there is no where else to schedule those tasks.<p>Moving DBs to separate machines was really to keep the utilization at low levels so that there would be cycles available when needed.<p>EDIT: Typo fixes.",1384458371

You can&#x27;t prove the existence of god any more than you can prove the existence of gravity. To make the connection between the math and reality requires <i>interpretation</i>, as Einstein repeatedly pointed out.<p>Gdel&#x27;s amusing exercise is just a formalization of St. Anselm&#x27;s, and most of the centuries of criticism of the latter can be applied to the former. In particular, his little proof has three definitions and <i>six</i> special-purpose axioms, and, in addition to all this, depends on a property of goodness or perfection that is only defined implicitly. Naturally, the existence of something that he interprets as &quot;god&quot; falls out as a theorem. Big deal.<p>The nature of mathematics are that the theorems are contained within the axioms.

Exploding the gif into frames was a giant pain in the ass until I checked out StackOverflow, and the source for Wand, and found the coalesce function a bit hidden. (There are <i>many</i> ways to recreate a gif from its exploded frames - coalesce handles all the permutations as far as I can tell.)<p>For the creation tool specifically I tried out several of the Javascript only gif creation libraries and wasnt crazy about the colors they produced, and was concerned about browser support, which in the end ended up being gated by lack of support for either the Blob object, or webcam/getUserMedia on all but Chrome and Firefox.<p>I havent given up on using the JS libraries entirely, but I wanted to get this out there first and see what people thought. The requests to create a gif a put on a celery queue and handled by worker nodes to keep the web app from hanging on creation requests.<p>The live preview in the creation tool fakes a gif by drawing each frame to a canvas, compositing the cropped/erased image to it, and just using a JS timer set to the gifs frame delay to flip-book through them.<p>All the gifs have been masked over with details of where, on each frame, the face should be placed, how big it should be, and how much it should be rotated.<p>Thats a part of the site that you dont see which makes that not-so-magic happen - the masking tool. This is a tool that uses the same cropping interface as the creation tool to generate the set of coords/size/rotation for the face on each frame. Theres some usability stuff there to help make masking a (relatively) quick process too. The masking tool uses the same live preview technique to see how the mask is coming along. Right now only myself and some of the other people I work with have access to the masker, but were considering how to give more people access. After masking a couple hundred gifs, weve realized there is a craft to it, and that takes a little learning. In the meantime were taking suggestions for new gifs to mask on twitter @gifyourselfin.<p>Well also support multiple masks soon, so you could have a mask for anyone in the scene if there is more than one person to put your face over.",1384457730

Maybe &quot;bad&quot; is a &quot;bad&quot; word here, but I think this is just a matter of urban planning. If you build a four-lane highway instead of one-lane street it discourages people from walking. Have there been a better public transport like buses, trams or subway, people wouldn&#x27;t drive so much either. If they have to drive anyway, because there&#x27;s no another option, they can drive further and thus don&#x27;t care if the place they are going to is 5 miles away or 10. I guess the cities would have to make the first step and plan the new neighborhoods as more dense, more urban environments. Housing developers usually only care about earning money, so if it&#x27;s cheaper to build everything the same way as before they&#x27;ll do it no matter what.

I&#x27;m managing bids manually, so it could get hectic.

As a consumer, I love it.<p>As a merchant, however (which I am), there is no chance I would accept this.  None.  Unless the issuers (that is, Visa, MC, Amex) drastically change their policies, which I don&#x27;t see happening anytime soon.<p>Why?  Because the issuers are very clear about a few things:  When push comes to shove and it REALLY gets down to it, unless the merchant takes a physical swipe of the actual card AND has backup to prove it (i.e. an imprint of the physical plastic), the issuers will side with a consumer in the event of a fraud dispute.<p>So why, do you ask, do most merchants not bother taking imprints of the actual cards?  Because a visual verification and physical swipe is usually enough (for 99% of cases).  Instances of fraud via card duplication are rare, so it&#x27;s usually not worth the hassle.  But in some cases, it is.<p>My business runs large-ticket purchases though CCs (average is $2000), and we take super extra precautions when our customers buy from us.  We take magnetic swipes, visually verify, AND take physical imprints.<p>We&#x27;ve lost several chargebacks because of lack of doing this.  You&#x27;d be surprised how these little-known rules crop up when you least expect them.  &quot;Sorry, customer claims charge not authorized.  Merchant doesn&#x27;t have physical imprint.  Chargeback approved.&quot;  It&#x27;s happened and we&#x27;ve been defrauded out of $thousands because of it.<p>The ONLY way we&#x27;ve been able to successful combat chargeback fraud is through the multi-layered approach.<p>Anyway, I know this is a fairly esoteric perspective and my business may be different from lots of others where this isn&#x27;t an issue, but I have a feeling V/MC/Amex aren&#x27;t going to get behind this.",1384457160

It&#x27;s the best combination of being able to be transparent (for a good case study) combined with the ability to get a good value.<p>The reverse auction actually prevents people from waiting until the last minute because it creates scarcity.  The moment someone places a bid, the store is off the market.  So for people who really are interested, they only get one chance.<p>2) Small eCommerce business like this usually sell for 2-3x sellers discretionary earnings, which is a term for net income with a usual exclusion for one full-time salary.  The fact that a full-time salary isn&#x27;t included is part of the reason they sell for a smaller multiple.<p>From the original post:<p>Currently, my operations manager, Pat, runs the day-to-day operations. He works part time and spends up to two hours per day running the operations of TrollingMotors.net. For more details on exactly what he does, please see the section on Operational Responsibilities.<p>When calculating sellers discretionary earnings (i.e., income) for small eCommerce businesses of this size, wages for one person (often the owner) are usually not deducted. Given that Pat and my combined operational workload for the business is less than 15 hours per week, I didnt include any labor costs per this normal exclusion in calculating sellers discretionary income.<p>However, I realize that most people (myself included if I were you!) would want to see the financials including payments to an employee. Thats why Ive listed below how paying an employee would impact the bottom line. This is the anticipated cash flow assuming someone else was running the day-to-day operations of the business, effectively putting the operational aspects of the business on complete autopilot.<p>Cost for employee wages is $15,000 / year (assuming $50,000 full-time salary paid at two hours per day), reducing the net income to $50,000 from $65,000.<p>You mentioned it can barely sustain one person which, if this all they did all day, may be true (depending on where you live).  But the operational time involved with running the business is 2 hours per day, which leaves a lot of time to do other things.  Most of the existing work has been done (website development, supplier relationships, etc) and the product line doesn&#x27;t change much so the website doesn&#x27;t need to be updated frequently.<p>Two hours a day can seem really low, especially from the perspective of the seller as I obviously have a conflict of interest.  That&#x27;s why I added real data points to the workload required for operations.  Over the last year, averages are:<p>- 3 email tickets per day
- 4 phone calls per day 
- Average call time of 8 minutes)<p>...plus some work at the beginning of the year to retrofit the website for the 20 to 30 new models that come out.<p>If you tried to take out a $150,000 full-time salary for someone out of the business, it obviously wouldn&#x27;t make sense.  But for someone who wants to get into eCommerce with a minimal amount of day-to-day work and quickly get a lifestyle business into their life, it&#x27;s a much better fit.<p>Hope this helps clear things up, and let me know if I can answer any follow up questions.  And glad you liked the traffic -> revenue chart!  I think it&#x27;s much more useful than simply traffic stats alone.  :-)",1384456965

And believe me, Warsaw is certainly not the most exciting place in Europe. :) Maybe that was because of cultural shift I&#x27;ve experienced, but the fact is that distances are way larger than here in Europe. Yes, you have a relatively good network of bike lanes compared to for example Warsaw, but the distances between the places where you sleep and where you can spend time nicely (restaurants, pubs etc.) make it way harder to get there on the bike. It&#x27;s not a big deal if there&#x27;s a good public transport that gets you from point A to B quickly, but there hardly is any public transport in the cities like Santa Clara, Sunnyvale or even Mountain View. And there usually is just one main street where you can feel a bit of the city life and vast areas around where people just sleep or work. I don&#x27;t question those cities are safe or that you can live in a more attractive neighborhood. I have also appreciated that those places are clean and close to the nature, but I&#x27;ve found myself feeling bad that I can&#x27;t just cross the street and buy some food for the breakfast or cross another street and grab some coffee/beer/whatever with my friends. I guess this is because of cultural difference between America and Europe, set of things you&#x27;re accustomed to, but I know quite a few people in London or London&#x27;s sattelite cities who moved there from SF Bay Area and feel exactly the same: suddenly there&#x27;s so much to do and everything is so much closer!

He used the example of the Portuguese trading their wine for English cloth, and said that it was to both countries advantage to be engaged in such free trade.<p>Well, two centuries later, how did that wind up?  As Joan Robinson pointed out &quot;the imposition of free trade on Portugal killed off a promising textile industry and left her with a slow-growing export market for wine, while for England, exports of cotton cloth led to accumulation, mechanisation and the whole spiralling growth of the industrial revolution&quot;.<p>In science, theories have to follow the data, the real world, reality.  In economics, the examples and data have to be twisted to fit the theories.  The OP article said the author article has a Nobel Prize in economics which of course if false, Nobel&#x27;s bequeath to his prize foundation included Physiology/Medicine, Peace, Chemistry etc. but not economics - after he died people invented an economics prize and stuck Nobel&#x27;s name on it so to try to give it the allure given to the other prizes.  Economics uses to be called in more honest times political economy, that it was given the more scientific name economics or economic sciences was a sign of it becoming less scientific - Ricardo may have been wrong about comparative advantage, but at least he tried to take an honest look at the economy.  Nowadays the theories he made which were disproved by history are held up as models, while his better ideas have been supposedly &quot;debunked&quot;.<p>Economics is not a science.  In its normal form it&#x27;s mostly a propaganda arm for some force in society trying to justify its actions.  I suppose in some sense economics could be a science, but only in the sense of being a branch of anthropology dealing with political goings on - a branch of anthropology the study of which would itself be highly politicized.  One reason science works is that no astronomist gains or loses by saying the next nearest star than the sun is Proxima Centauri.  It is light years away, and has little effect on things, and thus objective observation and scientific consensus are easy to achieve.  If a star closer than Proxima Centauri were observed, after some time needed for verification, surely the entire astronomical and scientific community would get behind the idea that the newly observed is now the second closest star to earth.  Economics fundamentally deals with the question of how the pie gets divided up, in which case scientific consensus is impossible and objectivity goes out the window.  It is one of the rare subjects on which you&#x27;re better off reading the material from two centuries ago - Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Benjamin Franklin, Jean-Baptiste Say, John Stuart Mill etc. - then that of today, because they were generally objective and fair, while most economic writing today is either partisan, or written under the influence of highly partisan ideas.",1384456723

- Data privacy: Renault worked with the CNIL (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNIL"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNIL</a>) to legally comply with French/European data privacy laws. All data sent to Renault remains anonymous, Renault does not associate the &quot;ID&quot; of the car with owner&#x27;s personal information.
-  Battery: He used the same gas pump analogy. When I asked him why a renting system for a part of the product, he replied &quot;simply to make it cheaper&quot;: Renault could have added the price of the battery (around 8000 euros) to the price of Zoe, but this is not a smart marketing move.<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll forward the conversation and your concerns to Renault&#x27;s communication team.

I just think it is important to the discussion.<p>It seems easy to me, in modern cultures, to think that newer always equals better/faster/bigger/smarter and in all other ways superior.  I think this is exacerbated by the fact that modern technology has made so many things possible that most people 200 years ago would never have dreamed of.  From automobiles to computers to smartphones, the technology of today is very impressive.  Because all of those things are &quot;modern&quot; it is easy to develop the mindset that anything over a certain age is likely to be inferior.  However, we need to remember that all of those technologies were built upon things learned by people in the past.  Also, often newer technologies make things cheaper, but manufacturers often chose to make those with poorer materials, and thus they don&#x27;t last as long.  In some cases, newer isn&#x27;t better.  Right now I&#x27;m wearing a sweatshirt that is over 20 years old.  It was a high-quality product to begin with (and I recognized that when I bought it), and it has been worn <i>very</i> frequently.  The silk-screened logo on it is still intact, and looks very good.  The material has a few small tears here and there from abuse, but overall the shirt has held together <i>very</i> well.  A lot of the clothing I&#x27;ve purchased recently (in the same cost-adjusted price range) has turned out to be junk that doesn&#x27;t last.  There are probably better examples of newer != better, so do what you will with that one.<p>There is also an inverse mindset which is equally as bad.  That is the idea that anything older is bound to be better.  Not surprisingly, the first mindset is often held by younger people, and the second by older people.  As people get older, they often fall into thinking the &quot;old school&quot; way is always better.  The important thing to realize is that, yeah, sometimes the old way <i>is</i> better (and probably more often than many young people realize).  However, it is equally bad to assume that just because an item or an idea is older that it is better.  I certainly don&#x27;t want to get out of my car and turn the engine over by hand to get it started, and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to hitch up the horses to go into town (though, admittedly a lot of things about having horses would be cool).<p>The long and the short of it is this, we should evaluate thing on the basis of their own merit, not on their age.  There are new treasures and old treasures, new junk and old junk.  I realize that this is probably just common sense, but even so I still think it is worth talking about.<p>... I&#x27;d like to again point out that I&#x27;m not saying that Kiro was implying a direct newer=better/older=worse relationship -- I just wondered if he might be.<p>Oh, and yes, if you &quot;haven&#x27;t seen a merchant where you swipe in ages&quot;, then it is very unlikely that you live in the U.

If they have a well-built internal library that is heavy on specific design patterns I&#x27;d expect them to give me a hard time over it because I could break some serious stuff or waste a ton of money writing ineffective code. Or maybe if they use heavy black-box builder tools that require some delicate coding to leverage the power of the internals.

The types of control sought were those of monetary, and thought/expression of thought.<p>Monetary control goes back to antiquity, where copying a book required expensive literate slaves to copy a book for about the same price as publishing one. Thought and expression control goes back to the censorship systems of the church, who sought to prevent critical dissent via restricting publishing using licenses - later termed a &quot;monopoly&quot;.<p>These two systems were then combined in practice. Not only were the printers/publishers restricted and licensed, but what they could print or reprint as well. This control over what was published not only served the church and/or state&#x27;s interests in enforcing dogmatic or state law, but also the monetary interests of the original publishers of a work. In essence, the publisher and the government form a pact to ensure each other&#x27;s mutual interests, at the expense of the common citizen.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until 1710 that the game changed. The Statute of Anne ushered in not only the destruction of publishing monopolies, but the argument (in form of law) that &quot;protecting&quot; a work from copying was primarily an incentive for scholars to keep churning out more works - the argument summarized as: <i>&quot;Why would learned men compose and write useful books unless there was financial incentive?&quot;</i> Flash forward to today, and that&#x27;s basically still the same argument used by anyone lobbying for copyright of anything. If it&#x27;s copied and nobody gets paid, nobody will make anything [intellectual/creative/etc] anymore.<p>Consider how amazingly specious this argument is today. Look at Wikipedia. Look at YouTube. Look at all the works being published under all the subversive licenses that are intended to surmount the aged limitations of copyright law. Do we really care to restrict what content you can produce, or if someone gets paid for it? More and more the arguments are about simple attibution, or freedom of use, than anything else.<p>All this decision finds is that the copying of books is by and of itself no longer a harmful act.

Further, I agree wholeheartedly that innumeracy drives bad policy (housing in SF anyone?) and mathematical models aren&#x27;t used enough. In a nutshell, I would love for mathematically-able people, like Chris, to be in charge of policy everywhere. All that said, this whole exercise seemed a bit futile and kind of pointless.<p>Given enough parameters and assumptions about it, any model can be made to produce one or another result. (I know, I know I should shut up and just code to make that point, but bear with me) In this sort of policy debate, the harder part is actually finding the assumptions that are consistent with reality[1] and sorting out the moral and ethics questions behind whatever policy.<p>In this case, it is far less interesting to find that a hypothetical implementation of basic income or basic job would cost the government N trillion dollars per decade than it is to answer associated the moral question: Given that the GDP of the US is M trillion dollars, and that the Ginni coefficient is g, and that these candidate implementations would cost N trillion dollars, should the government redistribute wealth in some capacity as to guarantee a basic income? a basic job? Tinkering with the models doesn&#x27;t really help there. All it does is change N. That helps when trying to answer the question, of course, but not too much.<p>[1]: Another example where this is the hardest step: It is easy to &quot;explain&quot; why there are so many more male STEM professors by noting that the distribution of <your favorite math standardized exam> has a std deviation slightly higher for males than females and assuming that a professor needs to be > 4std dev above the mean to succeed. The trickier part is measuring the distributions accurately and testing whether professors really need to be > 4std dev above the mean to succeed. fwiw, I believe that it is likely that the distributions are good enough and one does need to be that smart to be a prof, but testing those assumptions is the difficult and interesting part, not doing some numerical integrals of a gaussian.",1384456386

I didn&#x27;t take any theory courses at all, and the majority of my course work was programming in languages like Java, C++, and C# (also COBOL, and the like...)<p>* I applied at Brown University after talking to the admissions and computer science departments multiple times, in which they told me I wouldn&#x27;t be able to pursue a master&#x27;s due to lack of independent or undergraduate research or an undergraduate education in computer science.  The process of being told this was rather unfortunate, as the responses I received via e-mail telling me it wouldn&#x27;t be possible were ended with &quot;Sent from my iPhone.&quot;<p>* At the time I talked with them, I had been working at Basho Technologies for a year on Riak, an open source distributed Dynamo-style data store, as well as serving as a maintainer of rubygems.org.<p>* I was finally able to get accepted as a &quot;non-degree&quot; or &quot;special&quot; graduate student, which is allowed to take courses at full price.  This role exists primarily to allow students to determine if they would be a fit for graduate school, at which point I would then have to re-apply for degree seeking status.  This was possible because of an independent meeting I scheduled with Shriram Krishnamurthi, who, based on my industrial experience expedited the process along.<p>* Since starting as a &quot;non-degree&quot; student, I&#x27;ve been heavily motivated to attempt to stand out from other candidates for when I eventually re-apply to be a degree seeking student by independently publishing papers, publishing a blog, organizing a podcast, and speaking at conferences.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6510142"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6510142</a>",1384456375

In other words, the model may be more realistic, but the aggregate behavior -- such as consumption and economic growth -- tends to be relatively unaffected by inequality. This happens because of two things: (1) the poor people, exactly because they are poor, do not consume enough to create a meaningful economy-wide impact, and (2) people really hate being poor, and save more during good times so that they don&#x27;t get hit with the constraints in bad times. The second one can be to some extent accounted for by allowing a sizable fraction of people to be somewhat irrational, and by getting rid of the &quot;infinitely lived&quot; consumers; the first would stay though. I am curious about what is exactly done in the Carroll paper to make it matter.",1384455958

They can fire on many targets in succession with terribly effective weaponry like a 20mm cannon. They can fire from altitude where you don&#x27;t even see them. They can fly in-theater, autonomously until the time that they&#x27;re needed. They can return to base, be reloaded with cheap ammunition, then return to the theater of operation.<p>There are some very limited scenarios where the weapon system you&#x27;re proposing makes sense, but it&#x27;s a tiny niche.

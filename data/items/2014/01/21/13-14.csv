7095181,comment,7091635,7094419,3,0,ganeumann,,,"That was a bit of a simpler time, approval-wise. After animal tests Salk first tested the polio vaccine on himself, then on his wife and children. Soon thereafter he tested on a group of children from the Polk State School for the retarded and feeble-minded. Then he lobbied for permission to do mass tests.<p>So, a few things:<p>1. this testing environment would not fly today, as it should not have then. Testing on children who may not have the ability to give informed consent is unethical.<p>2. polio was the most dreaded disease in America, for many reasons. More people contributed to the development of a treatment--through the March of Dimes--than for any other disease up to that time. Even though the vaccine was feared and widely known, the mass tests were fiercely opposed by some. When the positive results of the test were announced, the nation treated the news much like the end of a war with exultation, presidential awards, and ticker-tape parades.<p>3. the polio vaccine was relatively safe and straightforward, as killed vaccines generally are. The killed vaccine was first tested in culture to make sure it was dead. Unlike many other pharmaceuticals, where the effectiveness even after a test can be murky and side-effects abound, a killed vaccine is relatively easy to understand. Testing a drug that may lessen the impact of a particular type of cancer is considerably harder, both in itself and because of today&#x27;s protective regulations.<p>4. the polio vaccine was developed by a very small team run by a zealot. The resources required were considerably less than the resources required to develop other drugs. Look at the development of the sulfa drugs for a counter-example: Bayer delayed their widespread release even after they had concluded they were effective and patented them because they wanted to make sure their patent was valid (source: &quot;The Demon Under the Microscope&quot;, by Hager.) Bayer had spent a lot of time and money developing the drugs and wanted to make sure they got a return. (Ironically, it was quickly realized that the patented sulfa drugs were in fact a combination of active and inactive parts and the active parts could not be patented; and soon after penicillin was introduced, sidelining the sulfa drugs. It&#x27;s a fascinating story, well worth the read.)<p>Source for info about Salk: the excellent &quot;Splendid Solution: Jonas Salk and the Conquest of Polio&quot; by Kluger.",1390312449

Have they been encrypted and stuck on the Internet as an insurance policy? Have they been provided to Russian intelligence?</i><p>Glenn Greenwald has made it clear that if something happens to Snowden (i.e. he&#x27;s killed), &quot;all the information will be revealed&quot;[1], implying that all the documents he stole will be released.<p>So, let&#x27;s imagine a conversation between a Russian intelligence officer and Snowden, sometime around the tail-end of July last year.<p>In fair Sheremetyevo, where we lay our scene, Edward Snowden is sitting in a bare room, furnished with nothing but a table (bolted to the floor) and two uncomfortable chairs. Snowden&#x27;s been looking at his reflection in a one-way mirror. A CCTV camera in a corner blinks a red LED at him and there is no door handle/knob on the inside.<p>Suddenly, a friendly-looking Russian bursts into the room and greets Snowden warmly, full of bonhomie.<p>Russian: &quot;Good morning, Mr Snowden! You are keeping well, yes?&quot;<p>He grabs Snowden&#x27;s hand and shakes it warmly. Snowden half-rises.<p>Snowden: &quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;<p>The Russian holds onto Snowden&#x27;s hand for just a split second too long, looking him in the eye with a half-smile on his face, before letting go and settling himself into the other chair.<p>Russian: &quot;Good, good! You just let us know if you need anything! So! I understand you seek asylum in Russia! No problem! We&#x27;d be delighted to offer you asylum! We&#x27;ll just need you to hand over all the documents you stole.&quot;<p>Snowden: &quot;What?! No! I can&#x27;t do that!&quot;<p>Russian: &quot;Come now, Mr Snowden! Under Russian law, before we can officially consider your application for asylum, we need to... <i>inspect</i> these documents of yours for evidence of criminal activity in Russia.&quot;<p>Snowden: &quot;No, I can&#x27;t... That&#x27;s outrageous! I&#x27;m not going to do give you those documents!&quot;<p>Russian: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Mr Snowden but I&#x27;m afraid I must insist! Otherwise...&quot; [He glances down at his lapel and flicks away an imaginary speck of dust before looking back at Snowden and shrugging.]<p>Snowden: &quot;Otherwise what? You&#x27;ll send me back to America! How could you threaten to do that?! They&#x27;ll torture me! They&#x27;ll kill me! How could Russia, with its long and impeccable record of respecting human rights and the freedom of the press even consider doing such a thing?!&quot;<p>Russian: &quot;It&#x27;s out of my hands, Mr Snowden. Besides... You know, there are some of my colleagues who have been reading what Mr Greenwald has been saying, about how the United States better hope nothing happens to you because, if anything does happen, all the documents will be released!&quot;<p>Snowden: &quot;Well, that&#x27;s an obvious way to make sure that the CIA don&#x27;t try to silence me by killing me!&quot;<p>Russian: &quot;Yes, of course but.. Well, some of my colleagues have beeen asking why we shouldn&#x27;t simply kill you ourselves and manufacture evidence that it was a CIA hit squad. That way we can embarrass the United States and simply download all the documents from the Internet when they are released.&quot;<p>Snowden: &quot;...!&quot;<p>Russian: &quot;I mean, these are crazy people! Relics of the KGB. They wouldn&#x27;t think twice about shooting you in the head. Or torturing you to extract as much information as possible and <i>then</i> shooting you in the head. I tried to argue against them but my power here is limited, Mr Snowden. I begged them to reconsider and eventually, they agreed to give you a chance to cooperate.&quot;<p>Snowden: &quot;...&quot;<p>Russian: &quot;So, Mr Snowden. You will share these documents with us?&quot;<p>No prizes for guessing how <i>that</i> scene ends.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/13/us-usa-security-snowden-greenwald-idUSBRE96C08Q20130713?irpc=932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/13/us-usa-security-sn...</a>",1390311875

He warned his supervisor, but his boss advised him to drop the matter. After a technical team also brushed him off, his boss finally agreed to allow him to test the system to prove that it was flawed.<p>>He did so by adding some code and text “in a nonmalicious manner” to his evaluation document that showed that the vulnerability existed, he said. His immediate supervisor signed off on it and sent it through the system, but a more senior manager — the man Mr. Snowden had challenged earlier — was furious and filed a critical comment in Mr. Snowden’s personnel file.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/world/snowden-says-he-took-no-secret-files-to-russia.html?pagewanted=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/world/snowden-says-he-took...</a>",1390311344

If your personal security depends on arbitrary decisions of numerous officials, contractors and directors in several agencies and their arbitrary cooperation with similar agencies in foreign countries, then the problem is systemic; and Snowden is the last person to be blamed. Basically, your government is not doing the job you wish it was doing the right way. If you don&#x27;t like and try not to support the system, then what do you care what Snowden released - you already accept the system as broken. However, if you rely and like the system, then you have to reconsider who you trust and with what.<p>Snowden here could only make you a service by pointing out a problem. And we all know that he really did not have any other way to do it. When he tried to discuss weaknesses privately within the system, he was dismissed. We know it not based on what he claimed (he could lie), but based on how NSA reacted and continues to react to the problem of trust. They made it clear that any employee who tries to discuss that topic would have a lot of trouble. It&#x27;s manifested in how they sent out brainwashing instructions to their employees, how they dismissed the topic in the press and how aggressive they are to Snowden generally. How many people would like to risk just chatting to their boss after all that?<p>Anyone who likes the idea of all-powerful all-knowing god-like government agencies like NSA, army, FBI etc, should consider who little leverage and security they have in the result.

It&#x27;s to archive* or <i>not to archive</i> that is the issue with most.<p>From my experience running a web design and development company is that paper files a lot like email archives are kept but not accessed.  I have 1 drawer filled with paper files related to a handful of my clients, and I can&#x27;t say I access them enough to warrant keeping or even scanning them (akin to moving your paper files to a storage locker).  Mostly they become paper &quot;todos&quot; which need to be kept so I can address them later.<p>I had the same experience when I moved from Thunderbird to GMail.

(If you think they do, you can argue equally persuasively for the NSA&#x27;s role in hiding aliens at Area 51).<p>The strongest argument you can make about NSA&#x27;s malign role in software security is that, by buying vulnerabilities from people who would otherwise sell them to vendors, NSA is retarding third-party security research and slowing the mean time to discovery for new vulnerabilities.<p>I&#x27;m disquieted by that notion too (it&#x27;s been a little while since I found the kind of vulnerability that sells for real money --- those are very particular kinds of flaws, contrary to popular opinion --- but I&#x27;ve had a &quot;no selling vulnerabilities&quot; rule for a long time). But I&#x27;m not naive. Most of the people who would sell vulnerabilities to NSA probably weren&#x27;t in a hurry to share them with vendors anyways.

The early adopters tend to be those who already use it outside of work.<p>I agree that the tools on Windows aren't stable: I've had to help debug at least 3 or 4 git installs of TortoiseGit-esque tools. I personally just use it from the command line.<p>Moving forward, we'll train people to use git when they go offsite with other developers, or if they're curious. Part of our job involves spending days away from an Internet connection, so they'll suddenly be sink-or-swim and probably never turn back :)",1270175387

Industrialization allowed for en-mass conscription, the railroad made transportation and supply chains efficient, and the telegraph and refined clockwork made it possible to run a war on an intricate schedule.<p>Today our big change is in information technology, allowing the government to enact more powerful policies with less overhead. If we can do this right, we'll enjoy both the smallest and most efficient governments in history.",1270175188

It means that the database stays internally consistent regardless of read or write order.  When you start a transaction, you see the data in the log before you started, but you don't see any changes <i>after</i> you start.  Fine.<p>You can get more isolation that this, and you need to to really keep your data consistent, but all DBs except Berkeley seem to have this off by default.  So I am not too bothered by this, but I would be interested in seeing how well Rethink handles concurrent OLTP applications that actually care about data integrity.  Caring about data integrity is slow, and Rethink might not speed this up all that much.  Or it might :)",1270174810

1235846,comment,1235153,1235753,0,0,chipsy,,,"My thoughts concur. To restate it in my own words:<p>As digital technology becomes more complex it tends to commoditize.<p>You can see the phenomenon across both software and hardware. For example, in music:<p>The Fairlight and Synclavier were monumentally expensive(priced in six-digits during the late 70s thru early 80s), being the earliest commercial computer-based synthesizers. By the late 80s multiple options existed to get similar functionality at a fraction of the cost(new hardware synths, MIDI, and 16-bit computers). And in the two decades after that, computer-based solutions grew better and started dominating. Now you can do all your synthesis, sampling, and processing ""in the box"" - and solutions with more flexibility than anything in the 80s are available for free. If you want to produce professionally and do things as quickly and reliably as possible, you can splash out for the cutting-edge commercial software, but it absolutely isn't necessary for amateur use. The most expensive stuff now is the analog bits: the guitars and microphones and monitors and preamps. But for a fraction of the old Synclavier's cost, you can now bury yourself in the top-of-the-line equipment of 2010. Apart from a few artisan works and rare vintage pieces, there's almost no ""multi-millionare"" grade equipment left to buy. Music-making doesn't need capital anymore, just talent.",1270174270

There are a couple solutions to this problem, but they're either impractical or just plain unacceptable for production boxes.

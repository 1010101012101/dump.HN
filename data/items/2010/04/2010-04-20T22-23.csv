It's still amazing that they got so much in total sales, but maybe they could have achieved something similar by just lowering the price.<p><i>Terry said that the band did this for a while, and soon they were selling about $1200 per night on average, even including those people who took it for free!

The default install of modern databases (Oracle, MySQL, and Postgres are all guilty) is to silently corrupt data rather than to abort transactions.  If you want data integrity, you have to explicitly ask for it:<p><a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~nuffin/KiokuDB-Backend-DBI-1.10/lib/KiokuDB/Backend/DBI.pm#Transactions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/~nuffin/KiokuDB-Backend-DBI-1.10/lib/...</a><p>Presumably this is because people get really scared when transactions fail.  (Except that's the whole point of transactions -- optimize for success, and clean up a few failures here and there.)<p>Also, most NoSQL databases are fully ACID.  OK, CouchDB isn't, but nobody uses that anymore, right?  What people ""give up"" with NoSQL is the strict structure of the relational model.  Things like sets and transactions still exist -- it's just that sets can be polymorphic, or you can use some other collection structure!",1271804365

Rockstar programming should be encouraged, not shunned.<p>It would be wonderful to have a Lenny Kravitz or Mick Jagger despite being washed up and well passed their musical prime able to crank out good Python code. So why the development community energizing this ongoing global campaign against the ""rockstar programmer"" and thus discouraging any attempt by these rockstars to reinvent themselves and to find success in a respectable and head-down career change? I myself am all for it.<p>In terms of employment, they'll be good for your firm and its morale:<p>- entertaining lunch break stories, and ""musical recesses""<p>- Because they're usually older and not money driven but rather skills driven, easier to manage and remunerate.<p>- You'll be seen as an equal opportunity employer and not age-biased.<p>- Most importantly, the PR value of having your startup or firm name-dropped globally alongside your rockstar will be priceless, more than making up for novice skill sets.<p>- Lastly, it's altruistic: getting rockstars off the stage and into the coding booth will be good for music: no more comeback hits. And we won't have these dinosaurs taking attention away from what would otherwise be standout emerging artists.<p>Rockstar programmers, bring 'em on I say. Let's support the likes of Kylie Minogue and Steven Tyler in their learning to become Pythonistas or Rubyists, or whatever language they choose, whether that learning be done on the tour bus or tour jet. So on behalf of the development community everywhere, we're right behind you, and we'll help. They'll mitigate further hearing loss too.",1271804093

Having the FTC be able to block the AdMob acquisition, is that really something that is going to hurt the consumer?
It seems to me, that outside of the natural resource sector, you really don't need anti-trust laws since anything that is created with human labor (ie. software) can never really be monopolized. Even if Company A were to acquire all of their competitors and then try to raise prices exorbitantly to screw over the consumers, Company B would be able to enter the scene and collect market share from them.

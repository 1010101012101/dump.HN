You won't like it, but when you're done, you'll say ""thank god i'm free of cobol!""<p>Come to think of it, Micro Focus is usually behind these lame annual PR campaigns to try to drum up talk about cobol. Their business isn't growing. Some reasons:<p>* Installing their product is a big pain. (At least on Solaris/SPARC and Linux.) Bugs in the installer script mean that you have to spend an hour or more on the phone just to install their junk. Support is included with the $3000 fee, but only for a year. So if and when you have to reinstall, prepare to pay a few hundred for the incident.<p>* Their product uses flexlm, and it sucks just like most consumer DRM, only worse, because it's buggy. I imagine that MF sees it as another form of copy-protection.<p>* The compiler doesn't play nicely with make, so when you rebuild your project, object files that are up-to-date are recompiled anyway.<p>* Interoperability with other languages and database systems is so cumbersome that you'll just end up writing output into some cumbersome flat text file, and have the rest of your system <i>poll</i> it to display progress from to your cobol program.<p>* The free/OSS cobol compilers won't compile non-trivial systems.<p>If you still think that the only problem is that it's ""unfashionable"", there are two possibilities: either you don't really know much about cobol (haven't used it in a real production environment), or you don't know much about anything <i>but</i> cobol.",1239470138

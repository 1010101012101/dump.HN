After having been in the shrinkwrapped industry since DOS, and thanks to MSFT using the UI as a cheap gimmick to keep programmers hooked, I can tell you from experience that the latest and greatest UI controls now yield diminishing returns that de-sparkle in about two weeks of heavy use.<p>Apple is finally getting some market traction, but MSFT has already devalued the UI angle badly enough that Apple can't be guaranteed that users will see Cocoa as superior to whatever MSFT has already pissed on.<p>My takeaway from this experience is the following:<p>0) Computing is becoming a necessary part of modern daily life, which is a lot more compressed than it was at the introduction of the pc. There's nothing novel about having a computer sitting on your desk.<p>1) Single commercial vendor control of UI standards is bad.<p>2) Other metrics, such as reliability, user flow, convenience, and by ext good use of user's time are of more enduring importance than cool looking UI controls.<p>3) HTML w/js is increasingly good enough, until something else much better grows out of that experience.",1210002462

181487,comment,180517,181335,0,0,raganwald,,,"I beg your pardon? It absolutely is their responsibility as shareholders to do that _if they want the best price for their shares_. Example: Tonight after the markets close, I offer $35 a share for Microsoft, in cash, conditional on obtaining 51% of the company.<p>The market thinks about this, and MSFT's price when the markets open tomorrow morning reflects their guess as to whether I will get 51% of the company or not, whether Ballmer will have me killed^H^H^H^H^H^H tied up in litigation to prevent me buying the company and firing him, whether Yahoo will raise some money from Google to buy MSFT as a white knight, whatever.<p>The point is, the market price when a company is ""in play"" reflects a bunch of people making wild-assed guesses about the possible outcomes and the relative likelihood of each outcome.<p>If you are strictly in it for the money, it's your responsibility to make your own guess. If you guess is higher than the market value, you hang on to the stock. If your guess is less than the market value, you sell.<p>Lawyers will do anything, but IMHO, the only time you sue management is if they make a promise they do not deliver.<p>But what if Ballmer stands up and says, ""Do not sell to Reg for $35, we are $28 today but I am going to buy Yahoo and our stock will be worth substantially more than $35 as a result of the transaction."" I don't get my 51%, and then Ballmer doesn't buy yahoo. Now shareholders should sue, they hung on to their stock because of what Ballmer promised.<p>Consider what happens if MSFT's stock trades at $33 and Ballmer blocks me from buying MSFT in court, then the stock drops back to $28. I can see a lawsuit. But what really happened? Shareholders culd have had a sure $33 in cash by calling or emailing their broker and saying ""sell.""<p>They _chose_ to hang on. Why? because they gambled on getting $35 if I got 51% of the stock? or hoping for $40 if I had to raise my bid? That's their gamble, why should Ballmer be on the hook for their wagering?<p>Hanging on to your stock because you guess that the stock will be worth more is entirely your problem. Hanging on to your stock because management make vague promises about the long term value of the stock is also your problem. You certainly can't sue the week after the offer.",1210001664

In the sense that no typical corporate hiring manager would approve of him and his habits, then no, of course he would not fit.<p>However, even corporations occasionally need people who just get things done. I have, in my past life as a programmer at a bank, seen some incredibly opaque, hard-to-maintain systems hacked together in the course of a few sleepless nights in 1992, which still tick, do their work, and help generate millions in revenue. IT departments then take months, if not years, to attempt to replace some of that code, and typically fail. So occasionally, people who work somewhat like Mel do get approved by higher-ups who value the productivity of one incredibly smart hacker over the productivity of a mediocre team.",1210001306

When I heard this, I thought, these guys are doomed. One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had to be built on NT.""",1210001246

No official evidence will ever be collected because of this.<p>This is really offtopic, but I think you&#x27;re wrong. There are two ways to do such research - the proper one and the racist one.<p>The proper one is to link specific genes to specific behavior. This presumes that you screen individuals in the study for those genes. Then you are not being racist, because existence of those genes is rarely 100% coinciding with culture or skin color. Research like that is quite common, if there is a reason to think there is indeed a link (for example there is a genetic study of above average intelligence in Ashkenazy Jews, they were extremely homogenous group and yet they don&#x27;t all share the genes that has been shown to have the link).<p>The racist way is to match skin color or culture to behavior. This is scientifically useless, because you don&#x27;t show any actual genetic link, and it only serves for stirring racial hate (you could pick any indirect attribute from many, like eye color or facial hair, so why pick skin color?). Such studies are rightfully being rejected by real scientists.",1433440723

To resolve this, I’ve interacted with the FTC, police, card issuer, and credit bureaus.  Here’s what I learned about the credit bureaus:<p>1. Equifax has no escalation path for security breaches on weekends.
Even if a breach potentially affects millions of accounts, there is no way to report it until Monday.<p>2. TransUnion has no ability to investigate hacks or security breaches.
They can only generate a reference number for the customer to file a police report with. (Note that their top product category is Credit Management & Protection.)<p>3. TransUnion and Equifax do not cooperate on investigations.
Despite evidence that suggests the same hacker was at work, neither credit union indicated any interest in even talking with the other.<p>4. If your TransUnion account is hacked, you will lose online access for life.
You will never be able to download your credit report from TransUnion again, and can only get it via mail.  For life.<p>5. Experian displays your mother’s maiden name on your profile page.
There is no way to hide this, obscure your mother’s maiden name, or select a different security question.<p>6. Experian agents cannot view support ticket numbers or track tickets.
Only a supervisor can access ticket numbers.  Of course, that means you need to talk to a supervisor…<p>7. Equifax and Experian are extremely reluctant to generate a ticket or escalate to a supervisor.
At Equifax, I requested to speak to a supervisor 7 times.  At Experian, the agent awkwardly tried to resolve a CloudFlare server error by asking if I was using Internet Explorer.  It felt endemic.  I did not sense this at TransUnion.<p>This experience has eroded my naive confidence in the consumer credit system.  The burden for prevention, monitoring, and remediation is borne almost entirely by the customer.  This doesn’t seem right.",1433440208

How accurately do we know how many calories are needed for maintenance? I would imagine this is highly variable, unless there is evidence to show it is not. People&#x27;s activity can be quite different day to day. Also is there evidence that metabolism occurs at a consistent rate? If all these add up to an error that is an order of magnitude less than 500, only then can we reliably use the number 500.<p>2. There is some new research [1] that shows that we may have to rethink the calorie-labels based on how foods are digested. For example cooked food are sometimes digested more completely than raw food, leading to a net intake of more calories.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/evolution/2013/02/have-we-been-miscounting-calories"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.sciencemag.org/evolution/2013/02/have-we-been-mi...</a>",1433439482

I probed the remote&#x27;s PCB with a Saleae logic analyzer and found it was a 12-bit code ASK-modulated at 390 MHz with bits encoded as sequences of 10 kHz and 20 kHz pulses. I bought a $13 spare remote to hack it and control the RF transmitter section from my computer through an FT232 sending the ASK signal. I just cut off the digital signal trace going from the MCU to the RF transmitter and hooked it to the FT232. I built a brute-forcer and it works quite well. I do not have my notes at the moment, but IIRC one code takes 25.6 ms to be sent. And my manufacturer (Genie) seems to require the code to be transmitted 4 times consecutively to open the door, that&#x27;s 102.4 ms. Multiplied by 4096 combinations, this gave me a brute-forcing time of 7 minutes.<p>I had tried Samy&#x27;s exact attack to reduce the brute-forcing time but it did not work at the time because I tried it before I discovered the code had to be sent 4 times consecutively (5 times makes it more reliable due to RF interferences). So I am not surprised to see Genie absent from the list of models Samy found vulnerable.<p>But I should try to find out the longest period of time during which these 4 repetitions of the code need to be sent. Maybe it does not have to be perfectly consecutive, but it could be 4 codes received within an interval of 200 ms or 1000 ms. If so it might still be possible to build a modified De Bruijn sequence that repeats codes 4 times while being only 4 times longer.<p>By the way it is very surprising a description of the 12-bit Genie protocol does not appear to exist online. These remotes are so easy to reverse engineer, so common (Genie is in the top 3 or top 4 most common openers), and so old (the protocol has existed since 1985), you would think there would be information about it online, but nope.<p>PS: I wonder if there could be commercial interest in cryptographically secure garage door openers? A $0.50 ARM Cortex-M0 MCU is all you need to implement a HOTP based on HMAC-SHA1. Then a simple learning/pairing system writing the key in EEPROM can even sustain the battery being removed from the remote. But there is probably no interest... which is why most remotes are insecure even the &quot;rolling code&quot; ones.<p>(Edited to clarify some tech details.)",1433439479

9660767,comment,9653389,9653389,0,0,seldonPlan,,,"I feel like this article is a bit sensationalist and lacks the other side of the story. I work for Disney IT, in the actual building pictured in the article. The layoffs in question were the result of a restructuring where many departments were shuffled and changed with an emphasis on new development work. Many employee&#x27;s were reassigned and transferred, along with those employee&#x27;s whose roles were removed. My understanding was that the purpose of the restructuring was to put more new development in the hands of actual company employee&#x27;s with ongoing sustainment work shifted to the hands of contracted employee&#x27;s. Many of the roles that were shifted to contractors included responsibilities for 24/7 call support and working general trouble tickets.<p>I cant really speak to the visa status of the contracted employees (I know that seems to be a lot of the focus of the comments in this thread). I do know that many of the people that were impacted by this restructuring found roles in other parts of the organization (which was mentioned in the article), many doing active development work on other projects. These employees included a wide range of ages and experience levels, so I really don&#x27;t buy that agism was part of this decision. I do not know what those employees ended up making in the new roles, but I do have years of experience with the HR policies of this company and would be very surprised if those employees weren&#x27;t making at or near their previous levels. With that said I really don&#x27;t feel there were significant financial gains to be had by shifting those 250 roles around. I recently saw some internal figures showing that the number of non-contractor Disney IT employees has actually gone up slightly in the past year. This could be creative accounting statistics or it could be that there truly is not some scheme to replace knowledgeable local employees with less knowledgeable out-sourced employees as the article suggests. My experience and gut says the latter is more likely than the former, but that is my own opinion. I wont speculate on the disposition of the employees that are truly displaced and out of a job as a result of this restructuring, but I do feel for them, and hope for the best for them.<p>I&#x27;ve been in my IT role with Disney for only a few years (I have many more years in non-IT roles), but for me, I like the emphasis on actual development, and less on ongoing sustainment. I personally don&#x27;t feel like my role or those around me are at risk of being replaced by an out-sourced team. I also work closely with some of the &quot;managed services&quot; folks, and appreciate that they will be handling the monitoring and calls in the wee hours while I get to create cool stuff during the day.<p>Disclaimer: I by no means speak for Disney or it&#x27;s IT department.

It seems that the ambiguous wrath one faces when pissing off the king (NSA, gov&#x27;t, big corps) today is no different today than it was under feudalism and that in fact, while other countries actually make an effort and succeed at being ruled by law, the US is not even making an effort.

It is clear that the <i>expected</i> number of intersections is proportional to L. If you joined two needles of length L/2 (possibly at an angle) the expected number of intersections is still L, by additivity of expectation (note that we don&#x27;t need independence). By induction, the shape of the needle doesn&#x27;t matter,  and the expected number of intersections is proportional to L.<p>We can work out the constant of proportionality by considering a needle shaped like a circle of radius 0.5, which has circumference pi, and is guaranteed to intersect the lines in two places. Therefore<p><pre><code>  2 = C * pi

and hence C = 2 / pi<p>Now for a straight needle of length 1, we can never have more than 1 intersection. Therefore the probability of intersection is the same as the expected number of intersections, which is seen to be<p><pre><code>   P = (2 / pi) * 1 = 2 / pi</code></pre>",1433438008

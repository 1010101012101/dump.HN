2130358,comment,2127876,2130200,0,0,cdavid,,,"While I don't follow your thinking about google, I think that the ""special"" algorithm for search, at least the original one (pageRank) is not that special. Other people had the same ideas even before - what really made it so successful is their use of commodity hardware IMO, and that was only possible no sooner than late 90ies because linux became good enough (licensing any proprietary unix for 1000s machines would have been difficult). This and the corporate culture - it seems they manage to hire a lot of very talented people, not just engineers, from early on. That's pretty hard to do.",1295700949

This guy takes the false and insulting stance that poor are so because they're lazy (implying they somehow deserve it, somewhat further implying that there is some immanent justice in this world).<p>We should carefully, as usual, avoid anecdotes and concentrate on general trends. The overall figure is that poor people don't choose to be poor, and that they would live better if they weren't. The people who got rich chosed their fate, the fact that they're happy with it or not is largely irrelevant here. That's the difference between being alienated / exploited, or not.

2130328,comment,2129755,2129866,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"What I find so odd about this whole Python 3 situation is how completely accepting the Python community has been in the face of what amounts to programming language suicide. How on earth is it possible that none of the web framework authors decides to break with the past and just ports to 3 regardless of any incompatibilities? Why is an antiquated web server interface like WSGI more important than the whole of Python? Why are the popular postgres adapters and many other libraries not ported to 3? I just don't get it.<p>Of course all these people work for free so no one can tell them what to do. But I'm honestly baffled. If I work for free over years and years, supporting a programming language I like, I don't let it die like that.<p>I have looked into some of these unicode issues myself and I have a general idea about what the technical porting issues are. It's not rocket science. It must be something completely non technical that's going on here and I don't understand it.<p>It's infuriating for me to see that happen to a language I have been using on and off almost since its inception.",1295698237

The problem is, I haven't seen any paper presentation even at local college techfests. That would mean I am totally blank about how all this actually works. Right now I am making a 10min presentation giving all the material I have in my paper. I think that should be enough to cover all the points in brief.<p>But I would like to hear about experience that you have had if you had presented a paper at such conferences or you have seen anyone present.<p>I am getting really nervous as they would be expecting PG students or research scholars only, I am just a UG student and I don't know how I got an idea that was worthy of getting selected in such a conference. But yes, I did work very hard on this. Anyways, the conference is on monday, hope I get some replies by then.<p>I would also like to have tips about how I can juice this networking opportunity to the fullest. I am a UG sophmore in US terms and would like to take up a MTech and PhD one day.<p>[1]http://www.gcet.ac.in/icisd/index.html",1295697648

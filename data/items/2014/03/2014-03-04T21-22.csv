7343514,comment,7339092,7339092,5,0,tn13,,,"This is something that makes me both proud and sad about my home country India. We are still struggling with some of the basic problems that the developed world probably solved 100 years back. It makes me even more sad that just 60 years back India was hardly behind any other developed country.<p>Arunchalam&#x27;s example is also a classic case of how Indian government has destroyed India&#x27;s entrepreneurial zeal. When Arun introduced his cheap sanitary pad making machine, Indian government woke up and see an opportunity to gain votes of poor and goodwill of large companies.<p>Indian government came up with a scheme where poor women will get a &quot;fixed&quot; quota per month of sanitary pads paid for by tax payers.<p>---\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare (MHFW) is set to embark upon an ambitious programme, reports The Hindu on 21st February 2010, to reach about 200 million women with 100 sanitary pads per person per annum with a budget of some INR 20 billion in next 3 to 6 months.<p>-- [Source: One of the email threads I was exchanging on this matter with a friend in government]<p>This is another Indian government scam where big companies like Johnson and Johnson etc. will provide these pads at taxpayers cost to the poor women while politicians will take their cut. Going by past experience even the pads wont reach the women.<p>Those who might be aware of India&#x27;s economic history, it is full of such scams. Indian government often ran government sponsored health campaigns claiming things like<p>- &quot;Wash your hands with soap after and before having food and going to toilet else it will will cause diseases.&quot;<p>- &quot;Use iodized salt in food else your children will be born retarded&quot;.<p>- &quot;Use toothbrush and toothpaste&quot;<p>The reality is, even in rural areas the level of hygiene is way better. People used handmade soaps and  herbal alternatives for soap. (Even I used them in my childhood). During my childhood oral hygiene involved brushing teeth with 5 different types of leaves, gargling with hot water mixed with a mixture of 15 different kind of powders which were comprised of different kind of tree skins, herbs and roots. My father still knows the formula and I used it successfully when I developed a gum related infection.<p>And you know what? Indians used plenty of sea salt in their food. We ate salted fish, Salted Pickles and what not.<p>Today it so happens that all these small scale industries are already dead. Not because they failed to innovate or compete on price. (In reality some companies like Vico succeeded with these traditional products) They failed because government actively tried to kill them in the name of public welfare.<p>Today I am buying a Colegate toothpaste which claims to contain &quot;sea salt&quot;. The TV ad of this toothpaste shows a grandpa showing his grandson that his teeth are stronger at 80 purely because he used sea salt to brush his teeth in past. There are other companies out there which are selling toothpastes claiming to contain the exact same herbs that we used in past (Miswaak, Babool etc.)<p>When I visit Target and Wallmart I often see shelves full of crudely packaged soaps titled &quot;Handmade Soap&quot; selling at 3x the price of normal soap.<p>I feel sad for Arunachalam and many other people I know who are mad just like him because rest of us Indian citizens have failed to make a political choice which would have heralded these men as heroes.<p>Unsolicited Advice to Americans: I see American government taking same direction as that of Indian government in past and present. Pushing private interests of few in the name of poor. Buying votes by redistribution of wealth while wrecking incentives to be innovative. I might be wrong. But there is no cost to being cautious.",1393970390

I was trying to be diplomatic, but blunt is perhaps better for clarity: no expert C programmer should have any trouble reading and comprehending the syntax of the code in question, which is mainly what the parent poster was calling out. <a href=""https://www.gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/0fba2d908da6d0df821991ea5fdbeeda0f4ff089"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/0fba2d908da6d...</a><p>It&#x27;s probably tempting to think that unit testing might save us from security failures.  People have written many words on both sides.  But how many of us have actually tried it?  No one who hasn&#x27;t tried (and tried <i>hard</i>) to see whether unit testing works has any business arguing for (or against) unit testing.  We simply don&#x27;t have enough data to know whether it&#x27;s valuable.  And the fact that unit testing works in domains other than security isn&#x27;t evidence that unit testing would produce any kind of benefit in computer security.<p>What&#x27;s getting lost in the noise here, I think, is that it&#x27;s important to zoom out and think about a broad overview of how difficult compsec is.  Think about all the different situations that require security.  Even something as seemingly simple and straightforward as an OS-level copy-paste mechanism requires thinking about security.<p>Could you write unit tests to cover all security situations?  How about all possible situations?  If not all possible situations, then why?  What&#x27;s the difference between a situation that you <i>can</i> unit test and one that you can&#x27;t?  Is it possible to write a unit test that checks whether there&#x27;s a sequence of steps a user could take to exploit an OS-level copy-paste mechanism?  Can you unit test the efficacy of a TCP/IP stack?  Is it possible to unit test whether the Debian OpenSSL PRNG is being fed with sufficient bits of entropy?  Can you unit test whether the colors of your website are pleasing?<p>The most interesting answer to those questions isn&#x27;t &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; The most interesting answer is &quot;maybe.&quot;  Because &quot;maybe&quot; means nobody knows, and that&#x27;s fundamentally interesting.  It&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> to write unit tests for domains that nobody has thought of yet. (Yes, even tests that automatically infer whether your website&#x27;s colors are pleasing to humans.)<p>Could unit testing have saved us from this one particular case?  Maybe.  But is it possible to write unit tests in the general case?  Maybe not.  But you, I, and everyone else doesn&#x27;t know until we actually try.  It could be impossible, or if not impossible then infeasible, or if not infeasible in a dynamic language then infeasible in C libraries.  On the flipside, if you investigate, and you come up with a way of writing unit tests in the general case for security libraries, then you may have just discovered a breakthrough in how cryptographers can write security libraries.  Because if it&#x27;s possible to write useful unit tests in the general case for security libraries, then you will have demonstrated something that most cryptographers generally disbelieve, the same way that people disbelieve that it&#x27;s possible to unit test whether colors are pleasing.<p>So get to work!  There&#x27;s nobody stopping anyone from <i>right now</i> going and trying to write those unit tests.  Try it, write a blog post about your experience and the hardships, write about what you&#x27;ve learned.  I guarantee it will be interesting.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is that we should be experienced before we advocate or dismiss an idea, and the only way to get experience is to try it out.",1393969797

The fact is, there are quite a number of bugs that stayed in the code for a long time despite being not that deep. Maybe that says we don&#x27;t have enough eyeballs, but most of people quoting that sentence quietly assume we do, equating number of participants in FOSS communities with number of people actually auditing the code. Unfortunately, the former is much bigger than the latter. We pretty much have the same situation as we have in science publications where a lot of results are not reproducible and a lot nobody even bothers to check for reproducibility, despite reproducibility being the basic tenet of open publication and peer review and being necessary to validate the result. Unless there&#x27;s a reason to - e.g. an identifiable bug - not many bother to go back to existing code and check it for correctness.",1393969370

Those who make the best products will require a large enough expense for formal design, implementation, secure hardware acquisition, physical security (i.e. no simply running your exchange on someone else&#x27;s cloud without a lot of oversight), the <i>works</i>. This requires tons of <i>time</i> and <i>resource investment</i>.<p>Because if any part of that chain is improperly coded, designed, implemented, etc. it will eventually be exploited and you&#x27;ll be no better than the Poloniex type exchanges of the world.<p>In the meantime there will be those &quot;incompetent&quot; developers you mention with a shipping product already on the market. And theirs will be much cheaper as they don&#x27;t need to devote &quot;Space Shuttle computer software&quot; levels of development design and implementation effort. So you&#x27;ll be both late to market and more expensive.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about financial security here then you effectively need to be building a Bentley instead of a Pinto. But you&#x27;ll be competing in that unregulated market with Pintos with a consumer base full of people willing to take the risk of driving in a Pinto instead of a Bentley they can&#x27;t afford anyways.<p>And this has nothing to do with the government yet, either sanctions or regulations.<p>In fact this type of &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; is exactly why there is government regulation. They help ameliorate the inevitable &quot;race to the bottom&quot; by artificially limiting where the bottom may be.<p>But government regulation probably won&#x27;t help too much here since you can always run your exchange out of a country that doesn&#x27;t care and people can make their transactions with whatever identity they wish.<p>Who knows, maybe the industry will self-create and self-adopt appropriate regulation as a market differentiator.

As late as the 1670s, England was still burning witches (male and female) at the stake, to punish them for their witchcraft. But then Newton publishes Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 brings in a new regime, the English Bill of Rights of 1689 ensures everyone a trial if they are accused, everyone has civil rights, and suddenly, among the legal and intellectual elites, it becomes widely understood that witchcraft does not actually exist, everything can be explained by science, and people doing weird stuff need to have their civil rights protected. And by the early 1700s men like Jethro Tull and Charles Townsend kick off the Agricultural Revolution, doing weird stuff like feeding turnips to cows and collecting all the manure -- spooky weird stuff that might have gotten them accused of witchcraft just 30 years earlier.<p>And this story reminds of that earlier epoch. When you bring in real innovation (innovation that touches upon people&#x27;s profoundest taboo&#x27;s and fears) you either have civil rights, or you end up dead. And it does say something hopeful about India that this man knew his basic civil rights were going to protect him from accusations of witchcraft. Though, of course, this part suggests that India could still improve its protections quite a bit:<p>&quot;Worse was to come. The villagers became convinced he was possessed by evil spirits, and were about to chain him upside down to a tree to be &quot;healed&quot; by the local soothsayer. He only narrowly avoided this treatment by agreeing to leave the village.

7343251,comment,7340288,7341914,2,0,corin_,,,"To an extent I agree with you, in terms of the cause (I often compare paedophilia to being gay, or indeed to being straight - I&#x27;m gay and I&#x27;m fine with that comparison), and also in that we need much better treatment for it, not <i>just</i> punishment for illegally acting on it.<p>That said, there&#x27;s a huge difference. With social acceptance, gay people can live their desires without hurting anyone. Paedophiles can&#x27;t do that. They can either resist their urges (ideally with help), or they can act on them which is something neither you or I want to see made legal.<p>Unlike with homosexuality, I don&#x27;t think big legal changes are required - sure, there&#x27;s a lot of related laws that could do with tweaking (for example I read once - though unsure how accurate it is, believe it was a Reddit AMA with a paedophile - that here in the UK you can&#x27;t get help for paedophilia unless you show it&#x27;s become a problem, and if you do that you can also be prosecuted for it), but the solution isn&#x27;t to make sex with children legal.<p>So yeah, similar situation to homosexuality, but needs completely different solutions.<p>Edit: just to add another thought on the comparison.. I&#x27;ve never hidden my sexuality, and I&#x27;ve never had a single problem because of it, not even verbal abuse, even at school. (I guess I&#x27;m one of the world&#x27;s luckier gays.) I can imagine how horrible my life would be if I had to pretend to be straight and could never sleep with, or have a relationship with, another man. It would be horrific. But if it was paedophilia, rather than homosexuality, then on top of that you also have knowing that doing what you want would hurt an innocent child, knowing that it could put you in prison, knowing that even <i>wanting</i> to do it without ever doing anything illegal would make a lot of people in your life hate you...

I just don&#x27;t buy that the differences we&#x27;re talking about are significant enough to create fundamental incompatibilities.  &quot;The female tech network&quot; vs &quot;The tech network&quot; smacks of separate but equal to me.<p>I have no problem with female focused accelerators, but remember that YC doesn&#x27;t systemically exclude MBAs to create a network of 22y.o.s.<p>I&#x27;m enjoying the discussion (minus the part where you try to dismiss my cases as unrealistic) as you&#x27;re bringing up models and cases that I hadn&#x27;t yet considered.<p>Is the goal to have two networks, or to achieve gender neutrality in the existing meta-network?

Knowing the wire, it was impossible for the packets to be appearing in the way that they were(there was some packet level corruption).  After going through multiple wireshark logs, we found that the culprit was a hardware firewall in between the server and client.

Obviously, the broadcasters have a legitimate interest in not wanting companies like Aereo to game that loophole for their own profit. The public mandate isn&#x27;t implicated at all. Nobody is talking about cutting off conventional over the air TV. Streaming service like Aereo was never part of that bargain.",1393967338

You claim the testing isn&#x27;t done because the issues are either in state machines or in the math... yet we&#x27;re looking right now at a case where neither failed and some simple unit testing would catch the issue. Isn&#x27;t it a false dichotomy to say it&#x27;s not worth unit testing (not TDD) unless we switch to safer languages?

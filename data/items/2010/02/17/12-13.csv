1131391,comment,1131177,1131360,0,0,pmjordan,,,"It's not exactly rocket science, here's a simplified explanation (minus some subtleties):<p>You're trying to calculate n/d (and the result should be rounded off to the nearest integer[1]). Division is expensive, but you observe that you can divide by a power of 2 cheaply using a shift instruction, so you decide to transform the calculation into something of the form (n * d')/(2^N), which is a multiply and a shift-right instruction. For the two forms to be equivalent, d' = 2^N / d, which you precompute.<p>Certain values of N can be more convenient from a computational point of view - for example, multiplying 2 32-bit integers yields a 64-bit result; on most architectures, the high and low halves either land in separate 32-bit registers, or you have to calculate each half with a separate instruction. So if you choose N=32, you don't even need a shift instruction: you simply drop the low bits.<p>You also need to make sure you choose your d' such that your rounding will be correct for all values of n.<p>Depending on the exact value of d', it may also be possible to decompose the <i>multiplication</i> further, leaving only shifts and additions/subtractions.<p>[1] Of course, for floating-point numbers, you can just calculate 1/d, save it and multiply by it any time you need to divide by d.",1266410631

Users' expectations have become that creating a <channel,twitter,tumbler,subdomain,account> is THEIRS, they put the work in, built it up, only to have it taken away.  It's the little guy getting screwed and it's an emotional issue.  The closer you get to brand squatting the less sympathy of course, but the issues like pitchfork or the last one I remember (can't remember exactly what it was - but it was his name that was taken by a big corp) are legitimate gripes.  The internet is supposed to be a level playing field for individuals and fortune companies alike in many ways, and if users keep having their trust broken the whole notion of community and UGC could be threatened in the long run.

He didn't have an active website on it, but used it for mail. In 2009-ish, a design-agency was established as orango.nu and claimed the .dk domain from the registrar, and was awarded it because it ""would be put to better use"".<p>Only after a veritable storm of unpleasantness from the community and threat of a lawsuit (the outcome of which wasn't clear, since private property isn't well established in the domain name space - it's all private contract law, and the contract basically allowed them to do what they did), orango.nu gave up the domain and passed it back. No procedures, rulesets or legislation is going to be revised over this incident.<p>Obviously the system needs to be able to deal with (actual!) trademark infringing squatting, phishing etc. effectively, so making everything a case of private property isn't viable, but admitting error would definitely make me trust the .dk registrar a lot more.<p>Finally, even if you use your own domain for e.g. tumblr, their TOS still allows them to kick you out for no reason.

In that sense, it is like being religious.  The term <i>agnosticism</i>, or simply <i>not religious</i>, as I more often use, is indicative of a lack of belief.<p>Second, morality and ethics are part of the same social evolution that has traditionally produced religions.  Almost any citizen of a western country has ethics that are rooted in some vaguely judeo-christian notions, which themselves are rooted in socratic notions, and so on.  The social fabric doesn't have clearly demarcated lines for ""religious"" and ""areligious"".  Trying to imaging what western ethics would have been without the influence of religion is like trying to imagine the United States would have been without the influence of England.

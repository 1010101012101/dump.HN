So you are twice as wrong! Not only for assuming other women want what you want, but also that you want what other women want!<p>Ahem. Now that ""want"" and ""women"" have started sounding less like words and more like an arbitrary sequence of sounds, is anyone willing to contribute actual science to the discussion? People yelling at each other ""women are like me!"" ""no, women are like me!"" has, I fear, outlived its usefulness.<p>Are there any studies covering, say, startup success by founder gender? Any documentation on attrition rates from school -> university -> startup? Has anyone even been bothered to go out and survey the attitudes of women towards startups rather than just projecting out their own?<p>Rather than shutting up about what women want, I think a better idea would be to actually find out what women want. Gender balance is clearly an issue in the startup community, and not talking about it isn't likely to help. Are there few women because women don't want startups, or because startups don't want women?<p>I don't know, but there comes a point where more opinions are not useful.",1323676459

This isn't the emergence of a sharing economy - that makes it sound like we're moving from capitalism to communism.

3342750,comment,3342466,3342466,16,0,ootachi,,,"""And between these two giants, it will be no contest. Google will almost certainly have vastly superior search -- it's Google, after all -- superior messaging, superior office documents, superior spam filtering, superior video chat -- superior everything.""<p>I think the author is drastically overstating the inevitability of Google's product superiority. Google already spectacularly failed once at messaging with Google Wave, and Gmail doesn't actually have the market share that most people think it has (even just considering webmail). Office documents don't seem to be a make-or-break feature for social, and Google Docs has had very limited success competing with Microsoft Office (in fact, my favorite Google office productivity product, EtherPad, was killed in favor of Wave). Spam filtering is legitimate, but it's not that hard of a problem really in a technical sense; Facebook could keep up. Video chat is a weak point for Facebook, granted.<p>Besides, integrating your competitor's product as a feature of your own doesn't always spell success. Microsoft integrated Bing with its operating system through the IE search box, and look how little that has mattered. Both Apple and Microsoft have tried to ""feature-ize"" Dropbox, and Dropbox seems to have emerged unscathed. Instapaper is doing fine even in the face of the Safari Reading List. The list goes on. (Sometimes the strategy does work, such as IE against Netscape, but it's hardly clear-cut.)",1323676271

Women don't see other women in tech, so they're less likely to see it as a potential career path, and their numbers stagnate.<p>So the idea behind an event like this is to help break the perception that ""women don't do tech.""  If you have a concentrated event with lots of women programmers, women are more likely to show up just because they see at as an event they are welcomed at.<p>Having an all-womens' programming event also helps alleviate a lot of the pressures that prevent women from showing up at coed events.  Ask a female programmer you know about how it felt showing up at their university's computer club, or a hackathon, when they were still relatively inexperienced: they'll probably attest to feeling as if they needed to ""prove"" their geek credentials, or they'll talk about being afraid of looking like some incompetent girl (as opposed to simply incompetent).

  3. Go to business school right out of the gate.
  4. Start early looking for a husband seriously.
  5. Milk maternity leave for all it's worth.
  6. Guard your marriage obsessively.
  7. Practice austerity.
  8. Do a startup with a guy.
  9. If you can't get men to do a startup with you, do a lifestyle business.
  10. Homeschool. Your kids will be screwed if you don't.
  11. Spend money on household help and Botox to keep more doors open longer.
  12. Break the mold in your 40s.

Transferring 64GB of music to an iOS device and then regaining that space is quite simple, and about one or two steps more than the equivalent action with an Android device.<p>Check the little box in iTunes that says ""Manually manage music and videos"". Drag your 64GB of music into iTunes. Drag the music from the iTunes library to your iOS device in the sidebar. Delete the entries from iTunes, delete the music from your SSD. Done and done. You seem to believe the media has to exist in perpetuity on the computer the iOS device is synced to. This is not the case, and has never been for either traditional iPods or iOS devices.<p>iPods and iOS devices are built on the sync model and don't use regular mass storage, so you need to use iTunes to interact with them. This has upsides and downsides, but if you wish to simply drag music to the device and then delete it from the source you can definitely do that with an iOS device.<p>On an Android device, you can download 64GB of music from the device and get it into the media player, but nobody is going to actually do that. Also, plenty of people carry Android devices and iPod touches as media players so I don't think this aspect is enough to make the Android media player a convincing sell over the iOS one.

5878911,comment,5878849,5878849,2,0,onion2k,,,"That depends on your definition of &quot;startup&quot;.<p>Before raising any money or selling something, there&#x27;s little point in a finance person being involved. Startups should be concentrating on building a product and putting it in front of people, defining a strategy for putting it in the market somewhere and doing everything they can according to that strategy. NOTE: That&#x27;s <i>not</i> a business model. You can&#x27;t really have a business model until you know who wants the product. You can guess at one, but that&#x27;s pretty worthless in my opinion because you&#x27;ll just throw it away once you get some market data.<p>Once you have a product and some knowledge of how it fits in the market though, then you can start doing financial projections and business modelling. That&#x27;s when a financial advisor is very useful. Still not much point in hiring someone though because there isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> much to do and most startups can&#x27;t afford the tools to do it. Advisors bring their own tools.<p>Then one of two things happens - investment or sales (or both). If there are sales after the product gets some traction, then a financial controller is a very good idea. The thing is though, then the company isn&#x27;t really a startup. It&#x27;s a &quot;proper business&quot;. If the startup goes down the investment route though, then there&#x27;s very little for a financial controller to do outside of the actual capital raising exercise - so they should still only be an advisor.<p>tl;dr There&#x27;s not much value in a financial controller unless you have sales, at which point the business is beyond what I&#x27;d define as a startup.",1371199276

If you think something up, you deserve some credit, but all the thought and investment that others put in using that concept as a base or jumping off point is surely more extensive if you get any significant recognition. Why is the single concept of the author greater than anything it&#x27;s capable of spawning? Why shouldn&#x27;t those greater ideas be allowed to propagate and flow organically? Why is the author entitled to constant, perpetual control and flow over this work which they <i>chose</i> to publish publicly, aware of the human impulse to remix, experiment, and learn freely without artificial limitation? Giving the author a fair head start is great, but we need to be careful not to make the system too unnatural and one-sided here.<p>>What about the much larger percentage that just scrape by, or who don&#x27;t enjoy any success for years before enjoying modest success? This is a far more common pattern in the arts.<p>What about them? If there is no demand for their work, a copyright won&#x27;t do them much good.

Sure she&#x27;s rich enough already... but why should she lose out on that money which she arguably earned?<p>She can continue to earn money by making a competitive product. A copyright is a short-term monopoly granted to ensure that authors can recoup expense before the rush comes in. It&#x27;s not meant as anything more than that. Whatever she makes in the first five years since publication is all she &quot;earns&quot; simply by holding a copyright. The rest of her money must be earned by contributing further to the progress of science and useful arts (perhaps by writing a sequel, which would have its own copyright term...) and/or competing on the open market with everyone else.<p>If the public takes the time to integrate your story into its culture, if they read your book and pore over the characters and develop their own interpretations and feelings, they should be able to share these commercially within a reasonable timeframe. When you publish something, it&#x27;s not your own anymore.<p>I think Joss Whedon had a cool quote from a reddit AMA a while back. It was something like &quot;Art is not a pet that you keep forever, which follows you around loyally without criticism until the end of its days. Art is a child, and it grows up and moves out and talks back to you.&quot; The real quote is probably better, but that was the concept.",1371198542

5878821,comment,5878497,5878718,3,0,cookiecaper,,,"I don&#x27;t see why a lifelong monopoly is required for the artist to receive the &quot;full benefits&quot; of their work. This discussion is about what legal options should be available to retain those benefits.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing with copyright: it&#x27;s a bargain between the public (IP consumers) and the authors (IP creators). The public wants new creative works and has recognized that some legal protection is needed to make these profitable, but when you share an idea and the public adopts it into their culture, it is no longer the author&#x27;s thing. We grant a <i>limited</i> monopoly on copyrighted works so that authors can make a living and produce good stuff for us, and authors accept this aware that their publication will eventually into the public domain for free sharing, cultural commentary, etc.<p>First, it&#x27;s important to recognize that a copyright is a monopoly. You don&#x27;t technically need a copyright to make money -- it&#x27;s just a temporary thing we provide to ensure that artists have ample time to recoup their investments. Original authors can continue to create products off of those IPs after the copyright has lapsed, and they can continue to sell and profit off of these; they just won&#x27;t be able to stop anyone else from using the same IP.<p>Second, the need for authors to be profitable is well recognized today, but the other end of the bargain is neglected. Ideas are free and they do not belong to people. &quot;Intellectual property&quot; is really a misnomer -- ideas cannot be held or controlled like property can. They have a very different nature. If your creation gets any semblance of recognition, people will modify, alter, suggest, revise, expand, and otherwise build upon your ideas. When you publish something, it&#x27;s not just yours anymore. Expansion and development and commentary are natural human activities that are impossible to prevent. Sharing and communication is everything to us, and copyrights restrict this free osmosis in a rather severe fashion.<p>Copyright is conceived to ensure an author can be profitable, so that more art comes out. Long copyright terms are seriously harmful because instead of encouraging new development from creative persons and/or those close to them, a successful copyright holder will be provided ample money for several lifetimes, and the monopolistic grasp that forces ALL revenue to go into their pockets propagates through the generations (right now, some copyrights could last 200+ years). Meanwhile, innocent parties attempting to expand on the copyrighted material and share in that natural human impulse for discussion and improvement, potentially contributing major social value to this cultural element, are hounded and threatened by aggressive lawyers. Does this promote useful progress in science and the arts? Does this represent the bargain that is meant to be recognized when a copyright is granted?<p>I don&#x27;t think copyright should exceed 20 years. Ideally I&#x27;d like to see default 5-year terms with four optional 5-year extensions. This makes it so there is still plenty of opportunity to collect revenues that are beyond reasonable, but copyrighted material will lapse into the public domain sometime when someone still living will care about the contributions that others may make. It opens up a whole new world of cultural richness, encourages creativity in expansion of old properties and the development of new properties, allows the author to obtain huge financial benefit (which they can continue to compete for once the IP goes public domain), and is fair and courteous to the public&#x27;s requirement that their culture not be held hostage by a bunch of suits (lawyers, executives).<p>Again, I don&#x27;t see why we need to perpetuate the myth that one useful positive contribution should entitle the contributor to a lifetime of exclusive control and revenue. That is not fair.",1371197317

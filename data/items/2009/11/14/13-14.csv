Of course we _are_ primates, so maybe it _is_ vital that Google hire enough ""alpha males"" or whatever.",1258207147

941711,comment,941606,941700,0,0,ig1,,,"Well there are two basic reasons tech startups fails technology failure and business failure. I assumed it was self-evident that a lot of tech start-ups fail on the business side (both those founders by coders and those founded by business people). Look at the list of YC company failures, they're almost all business failures rather than technical failures.",1258206807

I know you gaurantee a 24 hour turnaround now, but something to consider.</i><p>That should be considered into the business model, example: 24-hour guaranteed: $3, 2-3 day delivery: $2, 3-5 days delivery: $1. Then you could have different queues/printers for each option.<p>If you start growing, you could set up different locations to print closer to the destination and you could have a really cool service like: 2-3 hrs delivery guaranteed!<p>Also, you could outsource the printing and delivery, say high school/college kids who want to make some extra money, they sign up at your website and start receiving correspondence to print and deliver close to where they live. For each delivery they accumulate a certain amount of money and you send them a check at the end of the month if they have achieved a certain threshold.<p>Btw, congrats and keep at it, try your best and you'll do great!",1258206689

941706,comment,940689,940689,0,0,Keyframe,,,"I don't see a way to improve this situation. However I can draw a parallel with console market. In order to publish a game for a console, there is bar to entry on SDK price alone and then there is an approval process. If approval process is relaxed, there is a ""Seal of quality"" attached from the console manufacturer for good content, and people are somewhat educated to look out for that kind of content.<p>Apple couldn't charge for SDK at this stage, and if they did it would have to be something like XNA Creators Club. They could streamline/relax approval process and introduce Seal of quality type of content approval where applications longing for that status would go through a more rigorous process. Kind of like Microsoft has for Windows applications (I forgot the naming for those kind of apps).",1258206514

941700,comment,941606,941697,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> Probably explains why a large number of coder only startups fail due to lack of customers...<p>Was your statement, and it was only reasonable that you were asked to back that up. If you then say 'there is no data either way' then I'm wondering what you base your judgement on.<p>I've seen several 'coder only' start-ups go to very great heights so naturally I was curious if there would be some common element in those start-ups that you knew about that would differentiate them from the ones that I know about.<p>Business types in general are good at running a business from a management perspective, making sure that people perform at or near their potential. That in itself is a very worthwhile skill and it is an essential component, usually closely related to having people skills.<p>But those same people would be completely lost when it came to solving - relatively simple - technical issues.<p>Since you are posting this on a form where the majority of the start-ups that get looked at and launched are of a very technical nature that was the context you made your remark in, to now extend that to 'the whole world' broadens the scope considerably, but I think that it still doesn't change the nature of your argument, and so far there is not much to substantiate it.<p>Problem solving is a universal capability, it means that when presented with an obstacle you will find your way around, under, over or through it.<p>Business people have this but their 'talent' may be limited to doing that in a non-technical way. Most coders I know can apply that talent to all kinds of problems, including business ones.<p>That is why I think that a group of coders stands a much better chance of getting a company off the ground than a group of 'just' business people.",1258205921

941697,comment,941606,941680,0,0,ig1,,,"I'm saying there's no data either way. How would you suggest even obtaining a reasonable unbiased selection of companies to test the hypothesis ?<p>It's very hard to avoid selection bias, if for example you took a sampling of companies that received series A funding and were reported on crunchbase, you'd be missing a huge selection of companies that failed to make it that far (which could be because they lacked the business expertise to get financing, or could be because they lacked the execution capabilities on the technical side).<p>Not to mention crunchbase overwhelming focuses on consumer startups rather than b2b startups, which naturally introduces more bias.<p>Almost every business in the world is about problem solving, only a very small minority of them are technical, it's ludicrous to suggest that ""business types"" aren't good at problem solving.",1258205364

941691,comment,941504,941504,0,0,Mz,,,"Something that has been helpful for me:  I try to separate the skills/knowledge from my ego.<p>I went through a period where I was something of a ""star"" on a few small email lists and was constantly heaped with public praise.  I was uncomfortable with that but was told I had ""poor self esteem"" and these kind, loving folks were going to assist me in getting over it.  Of course, the more some folks sang my praises, the more others felt compelled to kick the living crap out of me and try to bring me down a notch or twelve.  Having concluded that my aversion to public praise is rooted in wisdom, not neurosis, I have since worked hard on learning to present good information that stands on its own merits while simultaneously deflecting public praise since it actually undermines my efforts to put out good info by putting too much of the focus on me and my ego.  In spite of still putting forth controversial ideas, I get beat up less these days.  With getting beat up less, I have less need to have folks telling me I'm wonderful because I don't have all those psychic wounds to salve.<p>I suspect one reason very competent people underestimate their abilities is because they tend to attract lots of criticism.  In other words, they are a threat to the pecking order and people make huge deals out of any tiny mistake they make (basically a desperate attempt to say ""you're not All That, dammit!"").  The approach I have worked out helps get around that issue.  I am perfectly willing to admit that I make mistakes and because I do not let people paint me into a corner and make this all about me and my ego, I get a lot less of that type of negative feedback than I used to.  (It still happens, but it's not socially and emotionally crippling anymore.)  This helps remove negative social bias (hostility) from my attempts to self-assess.  That has had a net positive impact on my confidence and self-assessment.",1258204576

Pageviews/1000 x cost per thousand impressions = Payout.<p>Sure there's cost per click ads, affiliate links etc, but display ads are still a big force out there and as long as that's true, then Digg's powerful.<p>Huffington Post does monster numbers.  They're also on the front page of Digg all the time for rewriting other people's reporting.  Digg drives a lot of traffic their way, but how many of those people stick around and engage?",1228262252

It's not that dirty cops are cops that started taking bribes & then got used to it. They take the job in the first place in order to accept bribes.

I've written about the migration of KDE from SVN to Git in a longer comment elsewhere in this thread, and Qt (not a language, but the library framework most of KDE's products build upon) switching to Git was definitely a significant factor in Git gaining traction among members of the KDE community. The KDE community consciously wanted to harness the potential synergy it saw in the KDE and Qt ecospheres syncing up on the same VCS.<p>OTOH, I think the Python community is pragmatic enough that it wouldn't have chosen Mercurial over Git if it being written in Python would have been the only point in Mercurial's favor, from the POV of their requirement set.

The money supply needs to expand for healthy economic activity and growth. If it doesn't, weird shit starts to happen.</i><p>Everyone has an opinion about BTC's deflationary nature, but few people seem to consider the possibility that BTC might be the first currency that works substantially differently in this regard to all other past currencies.<p>BTC is the first currency that is infinitely subdivisible.    Ostensibly only 21 million BTC will be created, but since it is subdivisible to 8 decimal places, there will be [21 million / .00000001] = 2.1 <i>quadrillion</i> atomic units.<p>And that is only an artifact of the data structure used to implement it in code, not an inviolable requirement of the protocol.  The precision, and hence the quantity of BTC, can be increased in the future if necessary.<p>This aspect of BTC, along with the fact that is not a debt-backed interest-bearing fiat currency might require a rethinking of the Quantity Theory of Money as it applies to Bitcoin-like currencies.<p>Additionally, only ~7 million Bitcoins have currently been created, only ~33% of the eventual total.  The BTC economy is so new you can't buy much with it besides other currencies, computer parts from Newegg etc., and perhaps illegal drugs.  Finally, forks like Solidcoin are appearing based on perceptions of consequential flaws in the BTC technology (absolute dependence on miners to extend the blockchain, etc.).<p>Imho it's worth withholding judgement for a few years at least and just observing how it develops.

Furthermore, the network effects (with pull requests on Github, not having to have people learn a new DVCS to commit to your project, etc.) seem huge.<p>Aside from some new innovation on the scale of switching from a centralized VCS to a distributed VCS, I can't imagine anything that would cause me to try to start a project in something other than git, learn another VCS other than git, or try to convert someone to another VCS other than git.  Is this the wrong attitude?<p>Is there any chance that Python might see the light and switch to git from hg?

Pretty quickly, you end up with non-smokers trading cigarettes with each other, because you can always get whatever you want through paying a smoker in cigarettes.<p>Bitcoin could benefit from that if it encouraged a very large drug market, because people need their drugs. If an easy, comfortable bitcoin drug market could get a lot of volume, it would become a lot easier to buy a cup of coffee or a car with it, and the prices would rise and fall based on the relationship of the ease of purchasing drugs with bitcoin vs. the ease of purchasing drugs in dollars. Maybe money laundering could keep bitcoin stable, too. In any case, to be successful, IMO bitcoin will have to be driven by something other than belief in bitcoin.<p>The use of the USD?

Groupon has amazing revenues on its books, but cash-wise it seems to play things close to the line.<p>It's a problem because it makes Groupon highly unpredictable. If a significant fraction of groupons begin to fail (and at any point in time the majority of Groupon's groupons have not been present cashflow) then Groupon is stuffed. And with only 3 years of operations, all of them exceptional and not steady-state in nature, it's hard to say what will happen.<p>You say ""Revenue is also cash - before expenses"". That's still not correct. Revenue can be booked before cash, cash be taken that isn't revenue. Sometimes cash comes in advance. The key point is: Groupon can book revenues that aren't backed by cash, and they have done so aggressively. And given their apparently high costs and relatively small cash reserves, it's basically a smoke-and-mirrors act.<p>They could borrow against their A/R, but it wouldn't be cheap given the factors outlined above. Whether they succeed or not still relies totally on a low bad-debts rate, regardless of what they can borrow.",1315444791

The percentage of kids choosing not to get an education there was at least as high (obviously we're both speculating a bit here).<p>That wasn't really the problem. The problem is that they got away with it. Not only were a significant number of my peers doing everything in their power to avoid as much schooling as possible, they also intentionally did so in ways that would exact the lowest penalties on their GPAs, allowing them to repeat the cycle at one of America's ""fine"" universities.<p>As an aside, in India and Brazil and other countries that are likely going to eat our lunch in the coming decades, kids act out in exactly the same ways. They did when you were in school, too, Chuck. And in India, and in Brazil, and probably when you were in Primary/Elementary school here in America, the teachers are/were allowed to beat the shit out of the students for doing so. And they still did it. The problem isn't 15-year-olds not having a complete mastery of self-discipline. The problem is a total lack of accountability which spans our entire American/Western culture.<p>I'm actually baffled that any intelligent person gives any credence to undergraduate degrees from American universities at this point. Anyone who can manage to take out 50-200k in loans and is sufficiently advanced in the <i>Art of Bullshit</i> gets a college degree in the good ol' USA. <i>Anyone.</i> ""Didn't study in high school?"" asks Santa Clara. ""SAT scores not so hot?"" inquires UCLA. Just go to a JC/CC for a while, and make sure to come on back and <i>pay us</i> whenever you're ready. We'll wait.<p>I see you're a USC grad, yourself. I would tell you about all the people I know who went to USC, that while some are very hard working folks and doing interesting, good work with their lives, many others are spoiled rotten rich kids (the types whose adjusted SAT scores were whatever they got plus whatever Daddy donated) entitled to a 3 day school week and at least as many hours spent playing beer pong as reading, with an unalienable right to a cushy gig ""working"" for one of Daddy's friends whenever they manage to get through their 4/5/6 year communications or sociology degree. Or athletesat least most of them have some appreciation for hard work and disciplinemany of whom would be better suited literally anywhere on earth but an ""institution of higher education.""

I <i>would</i> tell you, but I don't need to. All those people went to USC when <i>you</i> were there, too.<p>This is getting long. To sum up:<p>The following words will mark the headstone of the Great Champion America we all think we're a part of, but in reality hasn't existed in quite some time: ""A better life for my children.""<p>In the aftermath of World Wars I and II, since our emergence as (temporarily) the world's only military and economic superpower, and the eventual disappearance of the word ""manufacturing"" from that very same list, America has produced nothing quite so consequential as <i>several generations of the most entitled, work-averse sons-of-bitches ever to walk the planet earth.</i><p>so now we're fucked.",1315444624

Perhaps it was always there, its just recently it's becoming so not having a good education is a life sentence of menial dead end jobs so its getting more attention. Although I would disagree that it isn't disproportionately represented in minorities. Minorities experience it much more intensely because there aren't any competing ideals to help steer them in a positive direction.",1315444003

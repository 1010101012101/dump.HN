If the work achieves the stated end-goal-metric (&quot;A citizen of the state of South Tennechigan can purchase a health insurance plan subject to the given constraints.&quot;) the operator is awarded the revenue offered (&quot;$150 per successfully sold health insurance plan&quot;).<p>Think of it as a feed-in tariff. If you successfully purchase, install and connect a solar panel, and the panel feeds power into the grid, you&#x27;re paid. If not, because you screw up any of these steps, you don&#x27;t get paid. If you make a substandard installation (say, in the shadow or on a north-facing roof), you get paid less. The only thing that matters is the desired end goal: solar power is fed into the grid. You carry the risk, you get paid for the result.<p>The idea is that (at least in these cases) it&#x27;s much, much easier to describe and document a desired outcome than to accurately describe and anticipate all the variables that potentially affects the outcome.",1381409985

As a <i>single</i> founder/coder/hobbyist how do you do webdesign / frontend of a web service you build when all you ever did was devops/backend engineering?<p>Long story:
I wish to build a site relevant to my passion (travelling) which I think could also be very useful to other travellers. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &quot;startup&quot; by who knows - it might turn into one.<p>The issue: all I ever did and enjoyed was the invisible part of web services - server setup and management, deployments, monitoring, performance tweeks. But the core functionality of my &quot;startup&quot; will need a slick and modern responsive web interface. It will be close to impossible to use templates or CMSes like wordpress for it.<p>I enjoy reading about new UI toolkits, JS libraries and CSS helpers. I even built a slick and modern submitting form with PureCSS ! ;-) But no doubt I have no &quot;taste of art / design&quot; so I will never be able to do anything close as my friend did with html tables and gifs for spacing 10 years ago.<p>How do you, fellow engineers, coupe with that? I do not want it to block me from working on my project.",1381409142

I keep my sanity by doing short term consulting with private clients.  There are some sharp people working the Federal side, but it really is awful.<p>Winning a contract is EVERYTHING.  It is a writing contest, and you can be sure that the Federal contract officer knows jack shit about the actual fundamentals of the project.  The Contract Officer is a paper pusher whose job is to look at the line items in the Request for Proposal, and examine which company&#x27;s proposal best &quot;hits&quot; each line item.  And of course they will select a low bidder, which often is a bid too low for the company to even profit, simply meant to get their foot in the door.<p>The staffing of these Federal contracts is horrific.  You get entire teams of &quot;change management&quot; people.  I&#x27;m currently assisting on a personnel system for a major military organization.  I recently had to witness an entire discussion by the change management team on removing hyphens from a particular term to help the branding.  I almost threw up in my mouth.<p>The people I work with on the Fed contracts, in general, don&#x27;t touch technology when they leave work.  Therefore the only browser they use is IE8 (according to the customer org, it is more secure......) they do nothing outside of J2EE/.NET (usually just one of the two) and they HAVE/WILL never build a website that supports more than 5,000 enterprise users (concurrently).<p>It is incredibly easy to look like a wizard amongst this bunch, but the experience of the Federal world has made me avoid these projects like the plague.

Thanks for your insight, I appreciate it.<p>Years ago, when I was helping out my favorite bar get back on their feet, I had thought it would be a good idea to develop a POS system. I wasn&#x27;t capable of it at the time, I was just out of college and knew very little about running a project. Nowadays, I&#x27;ve got quite a bit of experience in inventory and ERP systems, but I also understand the market a little better now. For one thing, the people who complain the loudest are often the least willing to pay more for better.<p>This all got started because my business partner and I were doing some on-the-ground research into what makes a small business owner tick. We have an investor who has a Great Idea that is completely unworkable without a ton of data that these sorts of places are either uncomfortable providing or unwilling to put in the effort of providing.<p>And one of the constant refrains we heard in our interviews was that these people hated their POS system, knew it was partly their fault for not using it correctly, but didn&#x27;t have the time or inclination to get into it more. We&#x27;re talking owners of walk-in wine stores and pet grooming shops. Places where the owner is behind the counter, running the place, or directly managing the staff. They all opened their businesses because the business focus was something they loved, but they ended up spending most of their time wrangling data systems and tax compliance. It&#x27;s a major frustration point for them and we&#x27;d like to do something about it.<p>Do you have any insights into the types of support contracts that these sort of places are running? I&#x27;m considering trying to sell my services as &quot;labor for hire&quot; to help small business owners clean up and figure out how to best use their POS. It&#x27;s something I could get bootstrapped on right away and I think it would build relationships that could lead to more business opportunities. And it seems to fill the need that most of these owners have, in that they know that their systems are a mess but they don&#x27;t have the time to do anything about it.

6526939,comment,6525736,6526011,1,0,gjm11,,,"OK, what about light propagation according to the path-integral formulation of quantum electrodynamics? That&#x27;s <i>complex</i> in quite a literal sense, though unfortunately &quot;complex&quot; isn&#x27;t a top-1000 word so I had to say it a different way. Anyone who&#x27;s read Feynman&#x27;s lovely book &quot;QED&quot; will recognize the approach.<p>To find how a bit of light goes from one place (at one time) to another (at another time), look at every way it could take, straight or not. Imagine a little line that starts by pointing to the right and that turns as the bit of light goes along: if it goes two times as far, the line turns two times as much, and so on. But the line is always, say, one foot long. Now, do this for every way the light could go. Take all those lines and lay them end to end, and see how far the two ends are. The further they are from one another, the more light gets to that place at that time. (Of course you can&#x27;t really do this because there are too many lines to lay end to end, but you can look at only some of the ways the bit of light could go, and then look at more, and more, and you will find that the answers change less and less. As long as you look at enough ways, you will get about the same answers for where the light goes.)<p>You may have heard that light goes in straight lines, and how far it goes in a given time is always the same. You can work that out using these ideas: what happens is that for a way the light could go that is not straight, or that goes too far or not far enough for the time it takes, if you change them a bit then the turn in the line changes a lot, so when you add up the lines for these slightly changed ways the lines all point different ways and when you lay them end to end you get something much shorter than if they all pointed the same way. But for the straight line that goes just far enough for the given time, it happens that a small change in the way the light goes makes a smaller change in the way the line turns, so when you add up the lines for these slightly changed ways you get something that is still very long because the lines all point about the same way.<p>And that means that, if you fix how long it takes, the places the light can go in a straight line, going just far enough for the given time, are places that make the lines add up well, so lots of light goes there. But for all the other places in the world the lines do not add up well because they all point different ways, so very little light goes there. And that is why light goes in a straight line and always so far in a given time.<p>The same ideas tell you why light does what it does when it meets a mirror. And they tell you why, by blocking off some parts of the mirror so that light that reaches them disappears, you can actually make more light go to some places than if the whole mirror were still there.<p>The color of the light comes from how fast those little lines turn around. When you block off some parts of a mirror, the ways the light likes to go (that is, the ways for which the little lines end up all pointing about the same way) will change with how fast the lines turn. So light of different colors goes different ways, and if light falls on one of these blocked off mirrors you see red in one place, blue in another, and green in the middle, like when it rains and you look away from the sun.<p>Those round things with music on are like mirrors but with little bits blocked off (that is how the music is stored on them, but that is another story), which means that when light falls on them you get the same red-then-green-then-blue thing. Pretty! And all because of the way those little lines go around and you add them all up.",1381406495

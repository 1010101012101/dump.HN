Consequently, the visual experience is similar to looking into a box or tunnel having a small screen at a distance. Peripheral vision is good at detecting motion and as a result, occluded peripheral vision in HMDs can cause a user to experience motion sickness symptoms after some time.

What makes us unique is that we're the only platform that doesn't already assume a brand knows what to say. To help them figure that out we pull data from across the web and make recommendations on interesting content (whether their own or third-party) that might be interesting at any moment.<p>We're looking for backend and frontend engineers (we run backbone.js alongside our RESTful API) to join the team (the company is 16, product team is currently at 9). On the backend, we're especially interested in folks with good experience working with lots of data and excited to build real-time systems (we run python).<p>Here's a few reasons why you should come work here:
- You are gonna work in SOHO on Broadway
- Your chance to work with big data
- You come in early: We're only-and-a-half a year old
- As we get bigger, you will be able to focus on what you are good at
- We are all different and we love it
- GPL compliant company
- You choose your workstation
- You choose your tools
- No worries, free your mind: NY salary + medical + dental
- No vacation policy - does not mean no vacation ;)
- Company invests in you: Fly to PyCon and other conferences
- We prefer quality over quantity: Focus on clean code and test coverage
- Your voice will be heard<p>More info at <a href=""http://percolate.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://percolate.com/jobs</a>

4202442,comment,4202235,4202409,11,0,fpgeek,,,"Motorola, HTC and Samsung were all making smartphones long before Apple was. IIRC, they are all now being sued by Apple over, among other things, at least one feature that their smartphones had before the iPhone was even announced. So how's that previous history working out for them?<p>I'll also highlight my assumption: Apple's patent abuse continues unchecked. In other words, Apple's software patent assaults are delivering positive results without blowback. If that continues, why wouldn't they extend that to new areas? Wouldn't you expect them to attempt to maximize the return on their patents? If not, why not?<p>Now I'll admit I don't think it is likely that Apple's abuse will continue unchecked. I expect Apple's competitors to build their patent arsenal (e.g. notifications) and successfully hit back and eventually create a stalemate. But if they can't or don't, I'd expect Apple to see how far they can push things (just like any other corporation).",1341483454

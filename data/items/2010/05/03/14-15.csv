1314852,comment,1314227,1314227,0,0,hga,,,"Feh.  Yeah another example of why I stopped reading <i>Forbes</i>: if their articles in an area I know well are abysmal then how can I trust anything they say in areas I know little or nothing about?<p>In this case, the author confounds the real Moore's Law, which states that in a certain time period---1 year in 1965, 2 years later---the number of transistors of the lowest cost you can put on a die will roughly double with the resulting ""speed"".<p>Amazingly, Moore's Law is still holding up, but not the implicit promise of increased speed:<p>There was a corollary of generally increased clock speeds as everything got smaller, but as noted in the article we hit a brick wall there due to power dissipation (e.g. see the Netburst (P4) microarchitecture disaster).<p>But from my informal understanding of CPU speed, the greatest gains have come from better microarchitectures.  There are fairly clean examples of this in e.g. the evolution of the 680x0 and 386 and beyond lines of microprocessors, and we can see this today in examples of x86-64 and ARM processors that are superscaler (or not?) and in or out-of-order (Atom vs. most everything else, Cortex A8 vs A9, etc.)<p>Our problem here is of course that the microarchitects have run out of the big wins, e.g. ""Per Core, clock-for-clock, Nehalem provides a 15–20% increase in performance compared to Penryn"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_%28microarchitecture%29#Performance_and_power_improvements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_%28microarchitecture%29...</a>).  Nice, but not a <i>big</i> win, not like the 386 -> 486 -> P5 -> P6 steps, where among many other things cache was added, it went superscaler and it went out-of-order superscaler.<p>Maybe the author gets this but it didn't emerge in the final draft, but I have no way of knowing that....",1272898775

Unfortunately it is deeply flawed and in its current state does a great disservice to the students that attend school within the public system.<p>My wife works with undergraduate students at a major university every single day and she is a first hand witness to the poor quality of public education nationwide. The students that she encounters are often woefully unprepared for a college education-they have a poor grasp of written English, have low reading comprehension and their grasp of basic mathematical skills is better left unexplored. These students ARE NOT the bottom of the barrel either-the admission system filters most of them out. Its a very sad state of affairs.<p>Our children will be attending private school-even though I don't agree with their religion (most private schools here are Catholic) I can't argue with their results.

So far I've only installed the following:<p>- RockApp - much faster/better package management than Cydia; works great on iPad.\n- Backgrounder - works great on iPad - true multitasking.\n- OpenSSH - also works.\n- Vi Improved (vim) - works great.<p>What I really want is a terminal app that uses the iPad screen and has full bluetooth (hardware) keyboard support for Control keys.  I tried MobileTerminal, but the app is formatted for iPhone (comes up in a small window) and crashes immediately on iPad so it won't even run.<p>Warning:  I tried SBSettings and it made my iPad almost unusable; like an iPhone with no wallpaper, only 4 icons in the dock, many apps didn't work, so I had to restore.  Apparently SBSettings is not iPad friendly yet.<p>It would be great if others who have a jailbroken iPad could post apps that they know work or are safe to use, since the jailbreak ecosystem for iPad is still in it's infancy.",1272898548

In many ways, the iPhone has been the founding of ""open"" phone development. Prior to the iPhone, there was virtually no real development allowed on phones that achieved any levels of success (carriers had the platform locked down <i>hard</i>). Post iPhone, we've seen actual competition in this space - the entirely open Android strategy (though their App Store also has restrictions, they just apply them post-release rather than pre-release); the semi-closed iPhone and Nokia Ovi models, the web app model of all the platforms. People claiming that Apple has created a locked-down environment have very short memories - even the closed nature of the App Store via 3.3.1 would have been considered insanely open only 5 years ago.<p>Google have bet that unfettered platform mutability with (almost) totally free development is good for their business model. Great, and more power to them. Apple have bet that allowing a freeforall would cause their business model damage; OK, that's their call. Other platform holders are trying other strategies. The point being, the free market seems to be about allowing them to try these ideas, and fail if consumers don't like them.

Manage customer expectations; they are the customer's perception.<p>The article suggests getting things done early for the customer, and that is great, but the customer is also comfortable waiting until the exact time that you specified, too.  That early stuff is good bonus cookies, but the core trust issue is doing your thing on time.  And if, for some reason you cannot make it, as early as you can figure that out, tell them, and give them a reasonable new time.<p>As a customer, time is a very important thing to me.  For example, when my ISP has told me their tech is going to show up between 8 and 10 AM, 10:15 AM is completely unacceptable to me -- I usually call in for that.  If they had told me 8 to 10:30, I would not have had a problem.  Even better, if they had called to tell me they were going to be late as opposed to me having to call and find out after the fact that they were going to show up an hour later, I would have been happier.<p>This stuff is amazingly simple to do, too.  I think it relates to an implied point in the article: customers appreciate when you admit your mistakes and arrange ways to resolve them rather than hide/ignore them when they are obvious to the customer.",1272896842

Luckily, she's still in school, so that helps. I generally make up for it by ensuring to spend some time with her on the weekends.<p>We had a year and a half-ish in before the startup stuff started, so we'd already had a fairly solid foundation in place to build off of. Also, (even though I try not to talk about this online, but it's relevant, I'll make an exception because I like you, HN) the fact that we have an open relationship helps take a little load off of the responsibilities as well.<p>The other big factor with women and startups is finding a girl that's okay with splitting the check, going bike riding rather than going to the movies, playing board games rather than going out to dinner. When you're living on subsistence wages, it's quite hard to do the whole ""the man pays for everything"" bit. It should be impossible.

So being in summer school was not a burden and never having to worry all year long about homework, tests, notes, midterms, or finials, made it all seem worth it.<p>Alas, now as an adult making a living as A Web Developer, trying to understand Mathematics, I finally realize the true costs. I lack a foundation that makes even some Algebra intelligible even with perspicuous explanation. I need an overhaul from the foundations up. Where do I start? Are there any shortcuts I can take? I’ve checked ‘Better Explained’ [1] but it seems to not be systematic enough.<p>I am also having a hard time finding a clear demarcation of what I know, what I know that I don’t know, and what I haven’t a clue exists. How much should I learn – the rabbit hole is deep – and I am unsure of how much time to put in and how far to go.<p>I would greatly appreciate any help I could get climbing out of the hole I have dug for myself. Thanks.<p>.<p>[1] http://betterexplained.com/",1272896241

So it's easy for us to laugh from the sidelines... knowing that we would never make those mistakes ourselves... (oh, the naivete) but we're all making critical mistakes, and only very few of us are introspective enough to realize what our real weak points are. (We tend to dismiss those things we're bad at as unimportant and we overestimate how introspective we are compared to other people. I'm no exception).<p>It wouldn't surprise me if the mistakes Jacques has listed are pretty inconsequential in the big picture. Sure, it only takes one big mistake to kill a project, but in the course of 24 years everybody is going to make so many mistakes that it becomes easy to lose the forest for the trees.<p>Too gullible? That's not the end of the world. Everybody gets burned occasionally. Well, almost everybody. People who never get burned tend to be pessimists who never see opportunities, even when they're looking right at them! Maybe in this case there is a different problem, such as ""doesn't make contingency plans"" or ""too impulsive"". Even if you trust everybody completely you can still become hugely successful in 24 years. I suspect ""gullibility"" is only on the list because you feel like a fool when you get taken advantage of, not because you've been consistently cheated in the past 24 years. I also suspect that if you had become hugely successful you wouldn't feel so bad anymore about trusting the wrong people.<p>Or take ""seeing potential in people, not reality"". Perhaps in combination of the above this can be simply summarized as ""bad judge of character"", if that's not too harsh. Other things hint at this as well ""surprised when other people zone out"", ""surprised when people burn out"", etc. Or maybe you do see the reality in people, the ""spark"" as it were, but perhaps you just don't have the reality distortion field to turn those people into passionate followers.<p>Anyway, I admire the way you've described some of your mistakes, but I don't believe, not for a second, that these mistakes are actually what have kept you from getting the success you want.",1272896032

The real test, however, comes from your ability to build up from those axioms an elegant, abstract framework which gets closer and closer to describing your problem set. This is why smug Lisp weenies say that in other languages, you wrap your problem around the language whereas with Lisp, you wrap your language around the problem.<p>There's definitely a mindset behind building Lisp programs that makes it worth using, but sadly those benefits require lots of work to arrive at and are often buried in pages of elitist, manic-depressive drivel on certain newsgroups when trying to describe why someone should use Lisp.",1272896026

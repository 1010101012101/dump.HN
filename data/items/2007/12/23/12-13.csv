Apparently it increases oxygen availability in the brain. What I found was that it was pretty much a 30 minute cure for programmer's burn out, like a cup of coffee that actually worked by making you clearer and fresher, rather than just more restless and agitated. I wouldn't refer to it as performance enhancing, only performance <i>restoring.</i><p>Worth reading up on. I don't remember there being any contraindications, but YMMV.",1198414724

While I was doing it, my question of ""Why hasn't anyone done this yet?"" was answered very clearly!",1198413958

That's why you can get dizzy in a car when others drive, but not when you drive yourself.<p>Some people report motion sickness when using VR glasses; I think sharing the view would only make it worse for all but the guy in control.",1198413143

And then, I swear to friggin God, there's a list of my assets with an estimated value for each and I suppose the implied threat that I stand to lose them. Which kinda scares the living shit out of me, to be honest, since they've got a pretty thorough list, which means they've been doing some research on this and the offer didn't just come out of thin air. Their lists includes my home address, most recent assessed value of my house and all the information about my mortgage; a rental property that we own; my bank accounts and investment accounts, including the college funds for our kids, whose names are used; and our boat and two cars.<p>Damn. And right at Christmas. I am going to go make myself a drink.",1198412919

92183,comment,91904,92176,0,0,euccastro,,,"The ""magic"" is in the man, but not in the software. I guess it only takes a knowledge of the low level Wii remote protocols and a good grasp of linear algebra to execute this. Most people that have that knowledge still don't come up with this coolest stuff.",1198412744
92182,comment,92007,92145,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"As a programmer I especially care as the epistemology in Aristotle's Organon lies at the core of how our startup models concepts and logical relations between them.  Fred Sommer's work on extending that is also extremely helpful, not to mention H. W. B. Joseph's incredible book on logic, the best I've ever read (and I read many) _An Introduction to Logic_.",1198412102
92181,comment,92136,92136,0,0,tarkin2,,,"I'm generally a prude when it comes to drugs, but I wonder how much this would increase cognitive <i>muscles</i>. I say this because I would expect the brain would, after a while, become used to this externally induced effect and therefore disregard internal mechanisms to do so. This is pure conjecture, though.<p>It would, however, be interesting to <i>momentarily</i> feel what it's like to obtain that kind of concentration in order to try to mimic it without the drug.",1198411862

You can map NIL to #&#x27;_false in a hash-table, and use (gethash nil <i>table</i> #&#x27;_true) to provide a default value.
Or you can also write a generic function:<p><pre><code>    (defgeneric ->altboolean (x)

There could be other ways, but as far as I know, none of them are portable, because even though it is <i>allowed</i> for all defined CL operators to be implemented as built-ins, you generally cannot <i>expect</i> or <i>assume</i> that it is done so (see gethash in CCL and SBCL). As far as you know, and even though it would be terribly inefficient, they could all be implemented only by combining special forms.<p>If you discard IF, can you perform the elementary exercise using only special forms?

For example, the article mentions that male marines tended to be the ones who fireman&#x27;s-carried an &quot;evacuee&quot; in gender-integrated squads. Maybe the women are capable of doing it, but the men feel some psychological pressure to do it instead of them (e.g., chivalry), or the women expect the men to do it (e.g., chivalry), affecting the way the squad operates. The squad also mentions higher rates of injury among women marines.<p>That said, maybe there are some individual performance standards that cause these squad differences disappear. For example, perhaps both male and female marines who can run an 8 minute mile get injured less in training, but fewer women than men can run the 8 minute mile. Setting that as the time standard might eliminate the discrepancy at the squad level. The study appears to call out considerable performance differences however (1):<p>> The well documented comparative disadvantage in
upper and lower-body strength resulted in higher fatigue levels of most women, which contributed
to greater incidents of overuse injuries such as stress fractures.<p>> Anaerobic Power: Females possessed 15% less power than males; the female top 25th percentile
overlaps with the bottom 25th percentile for males. Anaerobic Capacity: Females possessed 15% less capacity; the female top 10th percentile overlaps with the bottom 50th percentile of males. Aerobic Capacity (VO2Max): Females had 10% lower capacity; the female top 10th percentile overlaps with bottom 50th percentile of males<p>> Within the research at the Infantry Training Battalion, females undergoing that entry-level training were injured at more than six-times the rate of their male counterparts. 27% of female injuries were attributed to the task of movement under load, compared to 13% for their male counterparts, carrying a similar load.<p>The military is right to study these things and try to do so objectively. And I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s wrong to compare genders or races - it sometimes leads to useful advances like studies of disease that affect certain parts of the population and not others (breast cancer, sarcoidosis, etc.) The point is that we&#x27;re speculating and more data will lead to better decisions.<p>(1) <a href=""https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2394531/marine-corps-force-integration-plan-summary.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2394531/marine-co...</a>",1441964942

S3 is about storage. It should be called Amazon Storage Server. Which it basically is (Simple Storage Service - S3)<p>* Amazon Memcached - I don&#x27;t used the service so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s only binary compatible with memcached but if its a generic cache that has multiple interfaces (the page references redis too) then more generic term like cache (and elastic implies it can grow/expand) seems more logical.<p>* Amazon Beginning Cut Pro - wtf. Transcoding is literally the process of converting a file from one type of encoding to another. That seems to be what this does. Final Cut Pro is not a mere format converter, it&#x27;s a non-linear editor.<p>* Device Farm - I&#x27;ll only concede that <i>maybe</i> this should reference mobile devices, but the name seems pretty clear and concise.<p>* CodeCommit - how is &quot;code commit&quot; less clear than &quot;github&quot;. By this logic, Apple&#x27;s email client should be called &quot;Apple Outlook&quot; because Outlook was a well known email client on the market.<p>* EC2 Container Service - the reference to EC2 means its slightly non-obvious, but Amazon Container Service would be much better than something referencing Docker. Docker !== Containers.<p>* WorkDocs, WorkMail - seriously, you&#x27;re just replacing &quot;Work&quot; with &quot;Company&quot; here.<p>* Storage Gateway - what are you <i>trying</i> to be obtuse? From your very description, this sounds like exactly what the name describes - a local gateway to a storage service.<p>* Elastic Map Reduce - the compute/processing part of Hadoop <i>is</i> Map/Reduce. How is &quot;Hadooper&quot; more clear than the current one?<p>* Machine Learning - you&#x27;re just being facetious now, right?<p>* OpsWorks - again, why does their name have to reflect a single specific implementation of a fairly well understood term(s) - Operations, DevOps, etc??<p>edit: typos",1441964195

I remember spending most of one summer writing a text adventure game with it, based in the Australian Gold Rush.  It even had NPCs which was quite advanced for text adventures of the day (I think the only NPCs in adventure games that I had encountered up to that point were those in the Hobbit, and of course the bloody thief in Zork (although he wasn&#x27;t really an NPC, but was implemented as a bunch of semi-random encounters)...<p>Good times.  In particular, I remember having to implement my own strings, because for a text adventure you often want to have access to strings longer than 255 characters...<p>Sadly, I never managed to make the jump from writing console applications with TP to writing proper Mac GUI apps.  But &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot; cost an absolute fortune at the time (for a 10 year-old kid at any rate), so I ended up scraping enough money together to buy another text book whose name escapes me.  I must have read the first few chapters about a million times - they talked about handles and graphics ports etc, but I could never get any code from them to run in TP (I think they were assuming that you would be using MPW?).<p>Which brings me to the point of this long rambling message - did TP really support graphics programming on the Mac?  I know my version of TP was an official bought copy, so we had the manual, but I don&#x27;t remember ever seeing anything that explained GUI programming in there.",1441963066

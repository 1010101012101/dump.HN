I went to IIRC for help and it developed that if you used d-feet rather than qdbusviewer, it worked.  Also, if you ran dbus-monitor you could see that qdbusviewer was setting up the call improperly and not reporting the subsequent error.  Wanting to be a good Open Source citizen, I wrote a bug report thinking that Nokia would both be grateful for having the problem brought to their attention and willing to investigate and try to fix the problem.  It didn't turn out that way.  What seemed to happen, from my point of view, is that the bug report got slammed into the ""Need More Info"" state every time it hit the maintenance engineer's in-box with no attempt to investigate the problem from a technical prospective.  It even reached the point where (and I honestly don't think I am exaggerating here) the ""missing information"" could not have been more than a few feet or few minutes away from the maintenance engineer.  Nokia does not provide a means whereby one can request more senior review of a bug report ""resolution"".

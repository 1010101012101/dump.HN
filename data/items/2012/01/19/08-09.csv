I have been reading this forum since last two years to keep\nme update on tech world.<p>A little bit about me.<p>I have  a PhD in biotech/pharma field and worked as a post doc for few years (45K/year). I have always enjoyed doing science but now I am slowly realizing that I am not cut out for the research or cubicle jobs. I would like to work on something which will involve interacting with real people in real world (directly or indirectly).I want to get out of bench/cubicle culture. Lately,I have developed tremendous interest ( do not know if I can call it a passion) towards web programming and web development as I feel I can come up with a MVP pretty quick to test a concept compared to bringing something in biotech or pharma field. I have moved to Bay area with a new research related job recently and i want to leverage it.<p>In my long term plan I am clear that I want to do the following things.\n1. I wan to be an entrepreneur and I want to add value in people's life\n2. I need to be financially independent as soon as possible.\n3. Start my own company and work with awesome people around world.<p>Babysteps so far taken:-<p>To get in to webworld and entrepreneurship, I have started the following things-<p>1. I have bought few domains and have started launching few sites with\nstatic pages and test blogs ( To know the basics of web application).<p>2. Watching Stanford course on Web applications and Programming.<p>3. I have started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. For web\nprogramming,I tried with python programming but quickly got frustrated with it. I just could not get my head wrap around it.So I have started MHartl's a Ruby on Rails tutorial and I like it.<p>4. Few days ago I came across with ROR bootcamp offered by Sheeref on\nHN and really wanted to join but being the sole bread earners with a family and kids\n(bread and health insurance?), I was too afraid to join .<p>So my few questions to fellow HNguys including PG (If I am lucky) who have been there and done that (and still doing),<p>1. What is the quickest but sturdiest path to get into programming to build a MVP?<p>2. Is there any place in Bay area where I can learn programming in evening?<p>3. If my long term goal is to be a web entrepreneur then how realistic it is to learn programming and then developing something and launching it?<p>4. Any experienced fellow on HN would like to help by becoming a mentor?<p>Any suggestions and inputs are highly appreciated. My email is on my profile.<p>I apologize for any typo or grammatical errors as English is not my\nfirst language.<p>Thanks to all.",1326962892

It isn't - this principle was invented around the time the printing press made mass production of creative works possible, for reasons which were very good at the time, but which may not be justified, overall, anymore.<p>Any argument about copyright cannot end up in ""Well, I think the authors should have control of their own works."" This is circular, and it boils down to assuming copyright as an axiom without justification. It also can't end up in an analogy to a case in the physical world - there are too many differences between physical goods and IP. For instance, in your example of the hen with bread, if this were a case of copyright, everyone _including the hen_ could end up eating bread, after the hen put in the work. Is this fair to the hen? Maybe not. On the other hand, though, there have to be ways to balance things just enough to reward the hen for her efforts without starving all the other animals. The conclusion we gained from the physical-world analogy in which _only one animal_ could eat the bread simply does not apply, as one of its fundamental assumptions has been violated.<p>In short, there are perfectly good arguments you can use (and which have been used, when copyright was invented) to argue why copyright is good and essential _for society as a whole_, and there are of course arguments against it as well, but too often these are not articulated _at all_. People argue from the end result ""Artists should have control over their work!"", which is essentially the _definition_ of copyright, and use it to argue for copyright. And all too often, the position of the rest of society - which, since they outnumber the artists, ought to be given more weight - is ignored.",1326961313

Libraries. Personal borrowing. Museums. Broadcast TV and radio. For the entirety of the modern age it has been the norm for the average individual ""consuming"" a creative work to do so without directly purchasing a licensed copy. Somehow creative industries survived.<p>Today the limits to copying are very different and thus unfamiliar if not frightening for some. Yet creative industries have not died and are not dying, despite persistent attempts to fight against modern technology at every stage (resisting digital distribution, creating experiences that are typically wholly inferior to the ""piracy"" experience). Imagine if literature, music, etc. never embraced libraries, radio, or television. Imagine if book lending was made illegal.<p>There are ways to embrace sharing and dissemination of IP without direct payment for every consumed copy while still maintaining profitability. The old limits are dead. Portraying all manner of sharing of creative works as ""intellectual property theft"" is frankly ridiculous. The idea that the line between borrowing a book from a library (or reading a book within the library) and borrowing a digital copy of a movie from a friend (or even a stranger) is a line between acceptable behavior and theft is an idea born of prejudice and provincialism. We need to get over such old prejudices and begin to form new models and new boundaries.",1326961107

Anyone relying on this when thinking about new laws deserves to have their constitutional rights slowly eroded year by year.<p>Let me add another historical example of reasonable reading of law going awry - in renaissance and later Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth there was noble democracy - all nobles had equal voting rights (that was +- 10% of country population). They elected kings, decided country matters during parlament sessions, etc.<p>There was instituion of ""liberum veto"" - it was thought to be consequence of all nobles being equal in voting rights - it meant that every nobleman could stop any decision made by parliament, just by saing ""liberum veto"".<p>For many centuries it was not as stupid, as it sounds, because it was common understanding, that this person could be then challanged to duel by anybody not agreeing with him (so people weren't overusing it), and that this veto only applies to one matter currently discussed, not everything that was decided during given session.<p>But starting in 1652 understanding of this law changed to ""liberum veto means any nobleman can cancel all decisions made during parlament session"". And people started escaping after screaming ""liberum veto"".<p>Of course it was abused by foreign countries - you just have to bribe one nobleman out of 10% of country population to block any decision (like decision to enlarge army).

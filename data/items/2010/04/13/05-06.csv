1261263,comment,1259099,1260654,0,0,unhappyms,,,"DevDiv makes about $1 billion for MS. Office on the other hand makes about $18 billion. So in terms of politics Office gets to decide what tools they use for the most part. Office sees it as a risk in terms of profit and hitting ship dates on time to switch to the latest stuff DevDiv is spitting out.<p>Rumor has it WPF is going the way of Windows Forms. It will be supported but no new features. With that in mind, think of all the UI frameworks MS has had wrapping up Win32: MFC, ATL/WTL, WinForms, WPF. Nothing seems to stick. Office just writes their own stuff that they KNOW they can depend on it being there. Duplication sure. But DevDiv is notorious for releasing things and deprecating the past ""great"" technology within a few years.<p>There is another reason they ignore the new tools: managed is slow for the client. For the server world managed is great and has won. Nobody in their right mind would write native web apps. They write the stuff that needs to be native (db, webserver) then glue the app together with python, ruby, C#, or Java (I know, a vast oversimplification of webapps).<p>Clients don't have the advantage of the webapps. We don't have a lot of computer to do things in parallel. Every millisecond counts to make the app appear as responsive as possible.<p>Why does managed suck for the client? JITing is slow and the code it generates isn't nearly as good as a compiler. NGENing is possible but still slow because of garbage collection and marshaling data between native and managed code. Little things like that add up and slow down responsiveness a lot on the UI side of things and that is what the user notices and complains about.",1271138221

It is perfectly consistent to say that the word of god is the ultimate truth but where god is silent on an issue science is the next best thing. There is no a priori reason to claim that the scientific method will give more accurate results than the word of god. The fact that science needs to keep updating itself is, for some (most?) people evidence enough that it can't be as accurate as the word of god.<p>But, thats not my point.<p>Most people get whatever knowledge they have of science from sources several level removed from the scientist. As a result, they don't get access to see the <i>true science.</i> Instead, they take what they hear from (seemingly) credible sources and trust it. Maybe they put some thought into the arguments given but generally they don't, especially if no one is disputing what they hear.<p>With evolution though, there's people yelling at them from both sides. Both sides use what seem to be logical sounding arguments (though, under close inspection, one side's logic breaks down). In addition, one side also claims to represent god, which they are told is the <i>ultimate truth.</i> In their minds therefore it becomes:<p>Science vs Science + Ultimate Truth<p>It doesn't take a genius to see which side would win in that battle.<p>However, with medicine, God appears to be essentially silent on the matter. There are no options to weight. Everyone agrees. Nice and simple.<p>So yes, there is some hypocrisy, but its limited to the politically motivated few who are pushing the ID agenda. The masses are not guilty of true hypocrisy.",1271137057

This is true even if you get it at a bar, provided you get it as a pitcher. The food then costs maybe $5 on top of that. So this is $7 per-night under the described rules (""a drink every week with some friends""), which allows just over 4 nights out with a budget of $30. And that's only if you're buying food there, too (bad idea, honestly, you can feed yourself for a week with $5 of food if you're smart.

It seems to me that Apple would have been much better of not having made the change to the developer agreement, while at the same time heavily scrutinizing apps written with Adobe's tools.<p>There's (probably -- I haven't actually seen it) enough leeway in the old agreement that Apple can basically reject any app for any old reason they feel like, anyway, so there's no real value in adding another explicit reason to reject apps written with tools they don't like.  If they're just plain lousy apps, reject them for being lousy.  If tey call verboten APIs, reject them for that reason.  If they load flash files, reject them for having an unapproved interpreter.<p>My point is simply this: I think Apple could have avoided 90% of the current controversy by simply keeping it an internal matter.

There was a pride of lions within 50 meters of our jeep. \nWe had to get outside and push.

142263,comment,142154,142241,0,0,dkokelley,,,"While it's true that if you use debt financing, you're ensuring that you succeed or else, but consider credit card debt: Most credit cards have a high interest rate that compounds each month. By using credit cards (and carrying your debt more than a month or whatever your grace period is), you're increasing your expenses and your burn rate.<p>It would be better (IMO) to secure a business loan. You'll have a much lower interest rate and a longer time to repay - not to mention the easy regular payment plan.<p>Still, I prefer equity financing. 10% of a watermelon is more than 100% of a grape.",1206077919

142257,comment,142154,142241,0,0,Spyckie,,,"I thought you had friends who were willing to help you out...<p>Take money from whoever you can - friends, families, and fools. You're not at the investor stage yet where people can eat you alive, and you can just refuse it if they try to. Keep well funded if you can; don't wait until you're out of cash, as investors know you'll be in a bind and will use it against you as much as they possibly can.<p>Taking money from friends would add motivation (or stress, but you seem like the type who can handle tight situations) and resolve to getting your startup off the ground, so I would recommend you pursue those initial starting funds.<p>Taking money from someone does make you responsible for that money, but doesn't make him your boss. They're called investors precisely because they give you money and hope to make a return on it - they don't have time to boss you around. Also, if you take money from someone, it means that they believe in your product, which is a great boost to morale especially if you're going in alone.<p>Finally, there are other ways of raising money besides selling your company - I know convertible debt is one choice, but I'm not familiar with any other low-cost routes (besides YC).",1206077602

At that point, ask if you can move to working part-time.  They'd likely rather keep a good programmer on staff part-time than let you go entirely.<p>In my experience, part-time programming jobs tend to pop up more frequently at research universities than at corporations.

You can't logically claim anything from the ""accelerating curves"", except that technology does seem to be ""accelerating"" a lot. So ""exponentially accelerating technological development"" does not imply that there will be world-changing effects.<p>To me the whole ""singularity"" thing comes down to these two beliefs: a) AI is feasible.  b) When true AI appears on the scene it will have a profound impact on humanity. If I ignore all the confusing and contradictory definitions of the word ""singularity"", then my claim is ""appearance of AI leads to singularity"" as opposed to Kurzweil's ""accelerating change observed so far will lead to singularity"".",1206076176

He's not yet learned that incompetent programmers get hired all the time, even at the companies you might look up to as a college kid.<p>2. While he's trying to justify his mental model of #1 above (if you got the interview, you must be worthy, or else ...), did he not think to ask questions like ""maybe you just got that interview because of Stanford""?

Abstracting it out into another 'language' just means you have to deal with a whole load of quirks and workarounds you'd <i>never</i> see with HTML, and while it looks all purdy and shit to some, it's an absolute nightmare to maintain.<p>Want to nest elements? Either you can't, some syntax has been introduced to discourage it (the end of line pipe), or you're told to just... use plain HTML.<p>Want to interpolate variables? That's probably built in, which is great until you try changing it back to plain HTML, and then have to scan for all the interpolation, which is now plain text.<p>There's likely so much focus placed on ""one-lining"" everything that you have to do silly things just to actually make the template readable, when it wouldn't be a problem in HTML.<p>Never mind the total lack of portability and, especially these days, requiring a copy of Node just to run the damn things. Which is fine until you realise you shouldn't <i>need</i> to add a full on javascript VM to your development dependencies.<p>That so many of these attempts at 'HTML templating languages' exist is probably testament to the fact that no one agrees on what one should look like.

Cyclical elections and lack of public interest are big challenges. I'd happily do more volunteer side projects to improve American government, but I'd be reluctant to try building another business around it.<p>I suspect a successful Open Gov business is mostly about finding a <i>market</i>. The people spending money on elections are mostly campaigns, and open government is not necessarily in their interests. Being in this space seems like studying environmental science: sure you hope to protect the wilderness, but most potential employers want your help getting around the laws. (Pardon my cynicism.) I think Votizen is essentially lead gen for campaigns, and we felt a lot of pressure to go that way. Perhaps one market would be helping big-dollar contributors find the best people to fund?<p>Even if you want to sell to campaigns, you should be aware that most election IT is partisan. Democrats have their solutions and Republicans have theirs. There is too much distrust for a vendor to service both sides.<p>On another note, one of the great things about open government work is that it makes sense for all kinds of political viewpoints. My co-founder worked on the Hillary campaign, while I'm pretty libertarian. Most of the people I met doing Open Government work were very liberal, but in my opinion anything that increases government transparency and accountability is good for reining in state power.<p>EDIT: added 2 paragraphs.",1361305925

(At best we might get something like Hsu's suggestion that we engage in embryo selection by making the best guess at which embryo has the most favorable set.) So from a sperm donation perspective, it's going to be hard to beat simply measuring phenotypic IQ and correlates.<p>> So we have no idea how to compare the trade-off between trying to influence people's IQs with shuffling different genes into them from the beginning of life versus influencing their IQs by improving their environments (at a critical stage of development? throughout life?) and we don't know which might have greater or more lasting effect.<p>They're not necessarily exclusive, of course. But since governments and charities already spend a ton on things like Headstart despite their long history of seeing IQ gains fading out, and the low-hanging fruit of nutritional interventions like pre-natal* iodization already taken, we would probably get more bang for the buck by looking at genetics - since no one is doing anything about that.<p>* I say pre-natal because I've been compiling post-natal studies on iodization in <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Iodine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Iodine</a> and one outlier aside, the effect on IQ or other cognitive effects is basically zero.",1361304980

5246762,comment,5242603,5242603,1,0,jlgaddis,,,"I'm not a ""developer"" or ""programmer"" by trade, like many of you here on HN are. In the last 15 years, I've been a Windows admin, a Linux admin, a security guy, and a networking guy. For the last several years, I have been almost exclusively managing Linux servers and networking gear (primarily Cisco and HP).<p>For background, I started out learning 6502 assembly at a very early age (which I've long since forgotten), Commodore BASIC, GW-BASIC, QuickBASIC, Turbo Pascal, and then onto Perl and, later, ""enough"" PHP to make some basic web apps. I wouldn't consider myself even close to being an ""intermediate"" level programmer.<p>After being introduced to Linux in the mid-90s, I began learning Perl (primarily to write CGI scripts). I've wrote a few small applications in PHP over the years but most of the code I've written has been Perl. Also, probably 95% of the code I have written is stuff that helps me do my job quicker, easier, or more efficiently (in other words, I'm not really developing applications for the ""public"" or anyone else, only for myself).<p>I recently decided I wanted to learn Python, but following examples or tutorials has never really ""done it"" for me as I quickly get bored. I've had much better luck by finding an existing problem I need to solve and then diving straight in and learning what I need to as I go along.<p>That's what I did with Python. A month ago, I knew absolutely nothing about it. I watched most of the videos on Youtube from Google's Python class (which is awesome, by the way) and worked through a lot of the exercises. Shortly afterwards, I found a real-world problem (at $work) that needed to be solved and, although I could have knocked it out fairly quickly with Perl, I decided to make this my Python learning exercise.<p>In the last two weeks, I've went from only knowing the very basics to a complete solution. Looking back at my code now, it parses command-line arguments, interacts with the user (to obtain a router password), uses SNMP to gather a bunch of data from an access point (this is a WISP environment, not your typical SOHO AP), connects to a Cisco router and makes a bunch of changes. SNMP, MySQL, regular expressions, working with files, lists, hash tables (""dicts""?), etc. It's not the most complex piece of code ever written but it's certainly well past the ""Hello, world"" difficulty level.<p>As you might guess, I performed a fair number of Google searches during the time I was writing my program. I didn't come across anything that I wanted/needed to do that I wasn't able to. Perhaps the documentation on docs.python.org isn't 100% complete or the best, I don't know, but I do know that I managed to figure out how to do everything I needed to, almost entirely from the results returned in my Google searches.<p>The author may be right about the state of the documentation on docs.p.o but, overall, I think it's irrelevant. There is sufficient documentation ""out there"" in the whole of the ""world wide web"" that any newbie to Python (myself included) can quickly learn anything about Python that they want to.",1361304800

If you're in a general business profession that relies on an office suite, not a developer or journalist where you're making simple unformatted documents or basic lists in Excel, LibreOffice doesn't even come close.  The same goes for Google Apps, and even Microsoft's own Live Apps.  The user interface in MS Office is so much more refined, there's a greater depth of time saving features, and it runs so much faster that spending money on MS Office paid for itself right away.<p>I've found that I personally have a great deal of cognitive dissonance when it comes to pricing for MS Office.  On the one hand, I hate the idea that software that I used to pay for once and have forever I now rent for a potentially greater sum over time.  On the other hand, I spend more time in MS Office than any other software I own, except for a web browser (which is usually productivity-detracting, not enhancing).

This includes client name, , location, salary/rate information, contract type (W-2, C2C etc.) at the minimum. If you do not give out at least some of these in the first call, dont bother calling the candidate. Remember they do not need you as much as you need them.<p> If you do talk to the candidate, be honest and specific. If you dont have a piece of information that is asked for, tell them you will follow up and do exactly that.<p> Do not tell the candidate that this position is so urgent that you need their Resume by tonight or the deal is gone. Top candidates do not like to be pestered. If they think it is worth it, they will send you the Resume without tantrums. If you absolutely need to express urgency (client is interviewing your competitors candidates and wants to decide quickly etc.), please mention that politely. Top candidates know that there is no such thing is URGENT REQUIREMENT that must be filled overnight. Hiring managers do not mind waiting for the right candidate usually.<p> If the candidate decides to send you their Resume, you have done a great job at convincing them that the opportunity is worth exploring and you are worth trusting. But this is half battle won. The candidate expects a lot more from you from here on.<p> Keep the candidate updated with any progress etc. If you sent the resume to client/hiring manager, let the candidate know. If the hiring manager is waiting or sitting on it, let the candidate know. Top candidates like to be in loop even though they might not be desperate for that job and can wait for months if hiring manager is sitting on the resume. But for the love of god, update the candidate at least once every 7-10 days. You can drop a 1 liner hey the hiring manager is still sitting on it<p> Do not just take the Resume and then stop existing for the candidate which means you never get back to them afterwards. This is the worst thing to do ever. If you are not interested anymore in working with the candidate or the client is not interested,let the candidate know asap. Remember, they do not really need that job as much anyway. The reason is that if you do need to work with them in the future, they will not consider you again. Top candidates are always in demand by many clients.<p> Treat the candidates with respect. You might be experience in what you do but remember that top candidates are also great at what they do.

If knowledge of the other player's strategy is relevant, that means that you have a payoff matrix in which there is no dominant strategy (that is, a strategy that provides the best payoff independent of the other players strategy); it is the essence of PD that it has a dominant strategy of defection and that its only Nash Equilibrium is (defect, defect).<p>> And being able to talk to the other player means the two participants can agree on a strategy in advance. It's not ""prisoner's dilemma"" because there's no dilemma.<p>Which doesn't change anything, in fact, advance agreement is part of another common illustrative description of the game (and actually the better one, since ""cooperation"" and ""defection"" are more clear in describing the PD strategies if there is a an advance agreement on strategy to hold to or defect from.) The fact that even with an advance agreement the rational, utility-maximizing choice is to <i>defect from that agreement</i> is essential to PD. That's the dilemma at the heart of PD.<p>The key ways in which the example here is not PD is that there is no dilemma, true, but not because of communication alone (or even first), but first because the payoff matrix is wrong, so that mutual cooperation is the <i>best</i> payoff for all participants, and (defect, cooperate) is worse for the defector than (cooperate, cooperate). This makes (cooperate, cooperate) a second Nash Equilibrium, and makes it so that defection is not a dominant strategy.<p>This makes communication relevant for a single-iteration, isolated game in way in which it is not for a single-iteration, isolated PD game.",1361304342

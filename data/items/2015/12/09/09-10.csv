10702805,comment,10693526,10693526,0,0,100ideas,,,"Similar lens-free &quot;computational photography&quot; techniques have been described for super-resolution microscopy (see below).<p>In conventional imaging, lenses resolve a sharp image of the target onto the sensor by focusing just the light emitted by the target within the lens&#x27; &quot;focal plane&quot; (a volume in front of the lens determined by the width of its aperture and the wavelength of the light passing through it) while blurring light from everywhere else into  background noise. One can think of this system as amplifying certain information (the light from the focal plane) while filtering out other information (the light from everywhere else) from the total input light.<p>In other words, the images formed by lenses are lossy by design. This isn&#x27;t practically a problem at macroscales, but at microscales the focal plane becomes extremely thin (micron-scale), oftentimes 1/100th as thick as the sample being imaged. To image large cells, for instance, a  microscopist might be forced to capture tens or hundreds of images of the sample from different focal lengths (a &quot;z-stack&quot;), then deconvolve them to generate an image in which most/all of the sample is in focus.<p>Anyway, I think these new techniques are interesting because they fundamentally attempt to capture more of the &quot;information&quot; present in the incident light. The lens does not capture an &quot;image&quot; that can be directly visualized, but rather a more full representation of the wave-field of all the incident light. Generating a conventional image from the raw data requires sophisticated additional processing.<p>The Ozcan lab has published some really neat (and eminently DIYable) work in this area:<p>&quot;Lensfree On-chip Tomographic Microscopy Employing Multi-angle Illumination and Pixel Super-resolution&quot;, Serhan O.

To provide an alternative tomographic microscope, we recently developed lensfree optical tomography (LOT) as a high-throughput, compact and cost-effective optical tomography modality. 7 LOT discards the use of lenses and bulky optical components, and instead relies on multi-angle illumination and digital computation to achieve depth-resolved imaging of micro-objects over a large imaging volume. LOT can image biological specimen at a spatial resolution of <1 μm x <1 μm x <3 μm in the x, y and z dimensions, respectively, over a large imaging volume of 15-100 mm3, and can be particularly useful for lab-on-a-chip platforms.&quot;</i><p>Also see <a href=""http://spie.org/newsroom/technical-articles-archive/3979-multi-angle-illumination-with-pixel-super-resolution-enables-lensfree-on-chip-tomography?ArticleID=x84293"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spie.org/newsroom/technical-articles-archive/3979-mul...</a>",1449655022

10702801,comment,10695340,10702368,0,0,netcan,,,"In a roundabout way, this is related to the big data world we live in, even though background checks & credit checks are not new.<p>From the perspective on a motor insurance company, for example, they don&#x27;t need to serve everyone. If they can classify the world of potential drivers as high, medium & low risk, that&#x27;s enough. Whether or not an individual falls into one of these categories &quot;incorrectly&quot; is not important, they&#x27;re average figures and as long as they are &quot;correct&quot; for the people who take out a policy all is well. For an individual that ends up in the &quot;high risk&quot; category, it&#x27;s inequitable and unfair. They might share characteristics with &quot;truly&quot; high risk individuals but not in ways that actually affect their chances of causing on an accident they just happened to be in a statistical cluster.<p>The BMI is an interesting example too. Weight bands for height works fine when looking at a population. You can fall into an obese weight/height band by being heavily muscled or broad bodied. Mike Tyson at his youngest, slimmest prime would have been classed as obese and very obese later in his career. Possibly &quot;extremely obese&quot; between matches. This is a good example because you can easily se how BMI works well enough for evaluating insurance risk but not for being &quot;fair&quot; for our puny human defections of fairness.<p>We are moving to a world of more data and more data based decision making. Online advertising for example, has transformed a big industry to one that is mostly driven by data based decision making.<p>The side effects of this will be many. There are certainly efficiency gains because that statistics <i>are</i> predictive. Having been arrested or serving time is probably predictive of risk, even if a conviction is overturned. There are also feedback loops that we don&#x27;t want, biases and &quot;traps.&quot; A homeless person is obviously high risk in that he shares measurable characteristics with other homeless people and they (almost by definition) actualize those risks.<p>There are real society-affecting risks here. It could become <i>more</i> expensive to be poor, as credit and financial services becomes a bigger part of how we purchase things.",1449654892

Here is one of them:<p>&quot;Seeing through sound: dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) perceive the spatial structure of objects through echolocation.&quot; Herman LM1, Pack AA, Hoffmann-Kuhnt M.J. Comp Psychol. 1998 Sep; 112(3):292-305. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9770316"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9770316</a> PDF:[1].<p>From the paper&#x27;s General Discussion section:<p><i>&quot;The results also argue strongly that learning to associate particular characteristics of echoes returning from objects with the visual appearance of those objects was not the mechanism through which the dolphin in this study or the Pack and Herman study accomplished the cross-modal matching task (cf. Harley et al., 1996). Rather, the most compelling general explanation for the demonstrated cross-modal ability is that echolocation yields a direct percept of the object, in effect a representation of the object&#x27;s shape that is analogous to or easily integrated with the percept developed through vision.&quot;<p>&quot;In summary, the results reported here as well as those of Pack and Herman (1995) begin to construct a compelling case for a concept of echo imaging by the dolphin. The dolphin can apparently use returning echoes to construct a representation of an object that preserves the spatial structure of that object, to the extent that representation can be used to directly recognize that same object through the visual sense alone. The very short decision times used by the dolphin suggest that the object percept develops almost immediately and is of an integral whole, rather than limited to the examination and extraction of selected features.&quot;</i><p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthias_Hoffmann-Kuhnt/publication/13516477_Seeing_through_sound_Dolphins_%28Tursiops_truncatus%29_perceive_the_spatial_structure_of_objects_through_echolocation/links/00b49529ef1099134f000000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthias_Hoffmann-Kuhnt...</a>",1449652342

Behavior of UL on a non-32 bit system according to modern standards and the compliance of compilers to that standard<p>and<p>3. That the declaration of a pointer to a constant int array was actually that. This is a prime case for using C-Decl or whatever the name of the program is that is mentioned in K&R, (or at least some googling).<p>All three of these should be looked up. If you have experience with a particular system that uses the last item a lot, then you possibly should not be looking that up. The other two items most assuredly should be looked up. Very very few people have the experience of writing code that works on all sorts of systems using processors of differing word size while compiling on modern compilers. Only those few souls shouldn't be looking up the answers to #1 and #2",1263736751

  * Take out card, press every digit that isn't in your PIN.

If you have a repeated digit in your pin you might need to press them all twice etc.",1263735917

1058422,comment,1058351,1058351,0,0,barrkel,,,"Taking the the title here at face value - nurturing terrorists, i.e. encouraging them to flourish and grow - is what the US <i>is</i> already doing, by invading various Muslim countries, and considering invading more - I hear Yemen is high on the list.<p>But of course the actual article is not about nurturing terrorists, but rather based on mistaken notions of the motivations of Islamic extremists (""they hate our freedom"" and other bullshit, and I don't use that word lightly).<p>Islamic fundamentalists are playing a power game. It works like this: US-friendly regimes supply the US with energy in return for support in various forms. These regimes rule with a tight fist to keep everything in line, because in heavily resource-dependent economies money flows in from the top down - the people down below don't particularly need to be appeased. So, the ruling elite isn't exactly popular. How to overthrow them? Attack the elite's biggest strength, its closeness to the US. By selling the US to the relatively moderate Muslim public as the great satan etc., they can try to foment revolution. The biggest thing that would help this is the US out killing Muslims in very visible and arrogant fashion. The US invading Afghanistan and Iraq, making moves at Iran, bribing Egypt to blockade the elected government of the Gaza strip, etc. etc. all play in to Al-Qaeda strategy.<p>The US is its own biggest enemy here, especially when governed by self-described ""strong"" leaders who predictably (i.e. weak-mindedly) attack when provoked, and a populace with a strong streak of Old Testament style ""eye for an eye"" vengance.",1263735749

1058419,comment,1058359,1058389,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Well, just to provide a single example, my wife is totally disinterested in games.  Absolutely doesn't care, to the point where if someone tries to motivate topic X via games she ends up feeling that topic X cannot have any value to her at all.  By contrast, she is very interested in math, and wishes that at school it had been presented as other than a collection of facts to memorize and processes to learn and apply.<p>I know of others who have a similar attitude to games, and now, as I approach 50, I can't care much about them either.<p>Games aren't ""Real World.""<p>If you want ""Real World"" motivation then find some stuff from the real world.<p>To add some context, I am <i>passionate</i> about putting things in context and making them relevant.  I visit schools to talk about uses of math, and explaining how these subjects are anything but isolated and irrelevant stuff to learn and hoops to jump through.  I've given talks in venues such as the West Yorkshore Playhouse, the Royal Exchange in Manchester, the Criterion Theatre in the West End of London, Navy Pier in Chicago, and others around the world.  I give examples from GPS and SatNav through intercepting drugs couriers and on to gene splicing and DNA analysis.  I talk about finding cliques and connections in social networks, and then apply that to detecting plaigarism and ranking web sites.  I talk about weather forecasting, roulette, life assurance and debt management.<p>I mention them in passing when relevant, but I don't talk much about games.",1263735482

A work day should not exceed 8 hours (lunch not included) in my opinion. I actually find my work interesting and enjoy working there, but I need to keep my work life and personal life separate.<p>Life is short enough as it is, so I don't want to spend 50% of it at work (more if you count the hours you spend sleeping). After a week of working ""overtime"", I feel mentally exhausted. It completely ruins my Saturday, so that's more of my life that is wasted.<p>I do have some pet projects that I work on sometimes. Even if I could integrate it into my work, I won't do it unless it directly affects my work. My work ethic is strong, and I always look for ways to improve the systems during work hours. But there is a limit to what I will do.<p>If my ideas does not interest my work place enough to include them in my work schedule, I will use them in my side projects.

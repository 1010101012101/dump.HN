You start out of the box with a well supported, standards based system for the basics: user management/authentication, data modeling/storage/query, routing, path handling, HTML templating etc etc. It has a huge ecosystem of modules, also effectively out of the box, for third party integrations and all sorts of esoteric requirements. So you start writing your custom code on an established base with a strong API for modification and integration, which means less custom code to support.<p>In a Drupal custom module you can do or change literally anything, and you can write whatever architecture you like for your individual component.

They don&#x27;t necessarily have a qualification in psychology or psychiatry, or work as a social worker. I thought this was true also in the US?. (Anyone can call themselves a counselor in the UK. Not sure what qualification clinical social workers have).<p>My second point was simply that pragmatically, an hour or less per week, which is how much time you see any of these practitioners, is not all that much time, and during an actual session they have to deliver the therapy. Most decent practitioners will spend some of their time outside actual sessions thinking about their patients, and human nature is that they will probably think most about the newer ones. Unless your therapy needs no serious &#x27;course corrections&#x27; after the first few months, it is probably easier to find a new therapist than to get an existing one to rethink.

Granted, this is mostly about bio, but even here there is a lot of hope with the bioengineering applications and the disease modeling. Generally, my anecdotal view is that folks don&#x27;t want to go to industry as they all see themselves as getting a tenure track job. Then the 2nd postdoc is not a startling success and they change tunes with only 3 months of funding to go.<p>Also, as other commenters have noted, Matt De Silva of Notable Labs may have had a bad quote attributed to him.<p>“Think about what a ‘hacker’ was to traditional computer scientists. Startups need the life sciences equivalent of that.” \nThis, as most people looking at bio from CS, is a laughable statement. I started out as a physicist and got interested in neuro. I thought that it was just because the bio peeps were lazy at learning the math, that a mathy person could sweep in and teach &#x27;em real good-like. Bio is a astoundingly complicated field. You have N overlapping Gaussian curves describing just 2 variables and each interacting in an unknown number of orthogonal (you hope) dimensions and variables. Just take a look at the KNOWN pathways for mammalian mitochondria [0] at some pressure, temperature, salinity, etc. Any variable can throw this off incredibly so, or not, or maybe a little bit. Also, what about muscle cells versus glia? But your study was on mice, not humans, or the humans&#x27; mitochondria has a mutation in it&#x27;s own DNA (yes mitos have their own DNA). Oh, and this is just the people you could get samples from. Bio is soooo very complex. Bio people are nothing but hackers. We have a very small idea of what is actually going on, and we try to exploit that in any small way we can. Look at Rita Levi-Montalcini&#x27;s discovery of NGF for proof [1]. She is an admirable person and a cherry picked outlier, but a hacker in the truest sense of any CS person. She set up the lab in her bedroom after being fired for being a Jew in WW2 Italy. Her dedication to knowledge for knowledge&#x27;s sake is amazing. She discovered there is a molecule that pre-destines daughter cells to be neurological by playing with chicken eggs and viper venom in he closet. If that is not a hacker, please define.<p>“The story of a business is about vision and progress: What are you going to do, how far have you gone so far, and how are you going to make money.”\nThis is exactly how grants are written as well. They claim a difference, but there really is none. You have to sell your grant just like you sell any pitch. Yes, the grants are mostly on paper and not in front of a person, but the story element is the same.<p>“In academia, there’s no wheeling and dealing around the grant process.&quot; \nYes, there are a lot less places to apply to than there are investors to find, but there is a LOT of behind the scenes stuff happening here as well. If you have a proven track record of getting grants and of getting out research, you get the grants with a lot less questions asked. But, yes, I admit there are a lot less rejections. A grant a month is typical. 2 a month is a little high.<p>Overall, the article was largely a PR piece. I think to help Ycombinator (the site I am posting on) to drive people to them for investment. Not surprising really. I could feel a bit of the &quot;pick up artist&#x27;s&quot; technique of &#x27;push-pull.&#x27; You insult a little, then you back it off and repeat. I don&#x27;t think that was intentional though. I like the article, but I feel it had a lot of naivete. Maybe a lot of VCs out there see biotech as a great space, as there is not really a lot of people in it and the ground seems fertile. I would caution against that. Biotech is very very hard to get going. FDA approval is notoriously difficult and expensive. The flip side to that, however, is that once you make it through, there is almost no competition and you essentially have a monoploy (hooray patents).<p>[0]<a href=""http://s437.photobucket.com/user/teriden/media/metabolism.jpg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s437.photobucket.com/user/teriden/media/metabolism.jp...</a><p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Levi-Montalcini"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Levi-Montalcini</a>",1448056190

10604057,comment,10595011,10595011,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I have very mixed feelings about Drupal. On one hand, it does have a lot of functionality available in third party modules; but the quality and completeness of them varies <i>wildly</i>, and most require custom code in order to be useful.<p>Another issue is maintenance. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever met a well-maintained contrib module; even ones that seem to be actively maintained aren&#x27;t what I would call &quot;well&quot; maintained...reported bugs don&#x27;t get fixed, patches don&#x27;t get accepted or commented on (I have a half dozen bugfix patches spread across three or four projects, including one for something in core, that have gotten no response, some for months). While Drupal doesn&#x27;t suffer from the crass commercialization that has befallen much of the WordPress ecosystem, it seems only companies paying for development get any sort of response. I don&#x27;t have a problem with developers prioritizing paying customers (I do it with my own Open Source software, as well); but, when someone sends a patch that fixes a bug, at <i>least</i> comment on why you don&#x27;t want to integrate it or give some guidance on what would make it acceptable for integration. I am beginning to feel like submitting a ticket to the Drupal issue tracker, even with a patch to fix the problem I&#x27;m reporting, is a waste of my time. If it were one project or module, this wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal; individuals get busy. But, I can&#x27;t think of any Drupal module or project that I&#x27;ve ever had a good experience reporting issues on. And, if I didn&#x27;t know that development is still ongoing, and that many new sites are being developed with Drupal, I would assume this extraordinarily poor level of interaction in the tracker was indicative of the impending death of the project.<p>There is also an academic love of complexity and abstraction in Drupal, almost to the point of absurdity, at times. Every new release introduces vast swaths of new terminology (often used in ways slightly unlike the rest of the industry use the term). Entities, nodes, rules, entity bundles, content types, views, entity references, delta, features, fields, hook, machine name, taxonomy, etc. About half of these do not mean what I would have guessed or are used in subtly different ways from what I would have guessed. And, it&#x27;s impossible for a casual Drupal developer to stay on top of this stuff; it moves so rapidly, and is so poorly documented, one has to read code. And, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of code. Somehow, despite all the abstraction, most modules include huge swaths of code, and aren&#x27;t particularly re-usable. Even very simple functionality seems to require pages of code. It&#x27;s often more of a pain in the ass to make the re-usable components work in some way that the developers didn&#x27;t think of than it is to implement from scratch. Partly this is my own shallow knowledge of Drupal, but I see experts building out entirely new modules to address very similar use cases to other modules they&#x27;ve made, so I&#x27;m not alone. Somehow, despite WordPress&#x27; much uglier code base, I&#x27;m generally able to implement stuff more rapidly than in Drupal; and many things that seem really locked down and hard to change in Drupal seem easy in WordPress.<p>The upgrade path is literally disastrous for non-core modules. One literally can&#x27;t get from point A (a Drupal 6 site) to point B (a Drupal 7 site) without writing a lot of migration code, unless you&#x27;re only using the most basic of core functionality. I&#x27;m months into a migration from D6 to D7. The new(-ish) Migrate module requires writing code, sometimes significant amounts of it, and is extremely poorly documented (and uses a bunch of its own jargon in confusing ways; the number of contexts in which the word &quot;migration&quot; is used for different purposes makes my head explode), and in-place upgrades don&#x27;t exist for a large number of modules, including pretty important ones (like Project Issue, the module used by Drupal.org for its own issue tracker...it has no working upgrade path, at all).<p>I see the benefits that Drupal 8 brings. And, having worked with Drupal 7 for a few months now during this migration, I see that the direction is a positive one. But, I find myself being angry a lot whenever I work with it, because there&#x27;s so much forward momentum (everything changes! all the time!) but nobody seems to give a shit about bugs, major usability problems, or providing a reasonable upgrade path. Really basic stuff that ought to go without saying, really doesn&#x27;t in Drupal.<p>So, it&#x27;s a real love/hate relationship. Which is true of every CMS I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot). I have decided to stick with Drupal through at least one more iteration and will launch our Drupal 7 site in a few days (if I&#x27;m lucky), but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever migrate to Drupal 8.",1448055610

But since they are equally trusted by the browsers, how does that increase security for me?<p>On the other key differences:<p>- Shorter lifetimes is actually an advantage, since it reduces the risk when your keys are compromised. Revocation is a mess, the only way you can be <i>sure</i> that a certificate can no longer be used is when it&#x27;s expired.<p>- No wildcards is an advantage too, since you can give each service its own certificate and if one is compromised, the others are fine. If you&#x27;re using an organization-wide wildcard cert, a compromise is much worse.<p>- Limited flexibility - &quot;you must have root access to your servers &quot; is factually incorrect, the automated Let&#x27;s Encrypt client is optional and you can request a certificate manually.<p>- Limited support - why would I need a SLA for a certificate, anyway? The OCSP servers?<p>- Management difficulties - while this is true now, the automation enabled by Let&#x27;s Encrypt is likely to facilitate management, not the contrary. I&#x27;m currently working on a Puppet module which will automatically provision certificates for web servers, something which used to be much harder.<p>- Build Trust with Purchased SSL - how do I increase trust by using a OV certificate? It&#x27;s not like an average website user would look up the certificate details, and there&#x27;s no functional difference between a OV and a DV certificate.<p>> The levels of encryption, validation, and trust that business and commerce websites require are available only with purchased SSL.<p>Unless you&#x27;re talking about EV certificates, I don&#x27;t see how. There&#x27;s no &quot;level of encryption&quot; which isn&#x27;t available with a free CA, and the additional validation and trust do not matter unless it&#x27;s a EV certificate. Even an EV certificate does not protect against MitM. The real answer is key pinning.<p>As a Namecheap customer, I&#x27;m disappointed by this blog post.

Iran is challenging that status quo.<p>Speaking generally, in any such situation the challengers appear to be behaving badly because they are disruptive - they have to disrupt the status quo to bring change. In the end, neither side necessarily has a more legitimate claim to power and both would do the same in the other&#x27;s shoes.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure either side behaves better. Remember the U.S. played a major role in overthrowing a (mostly) democratic Iranian government in the 1950s, then supported a dictator who brutally oppressed the people of Iran for decades. The U.S. supports insurgent groups in and near Iran, sabotages their infrastructure (the nuclear program), imposes crippling economic sanctions, and very likely participated in the assassination of Iranian scientists. I happen to think the actions against Iran&#x27;s nuclear weapons program are necessary, and Iran&#x27;s government is generally a danger to many people&#x27;s lives in the Mideast, but the West can hardly complain about Iran behaving badly.

Outlaw it where we can, conduct diplomacy to try to get countries that don&#x27;t outlaw it to outlaw it. War is a last-ditch option, one that I don&#x27;t think should be off the table, but we need to go into it clear-headed with a sane understanding of what we can and cannot accomplish.<p>The Middle East is practically defined by war. Bringing more of it to that region isn&#x27;t really going to do anything.<p>I actually think of Isreal as a model to work off of. Build bastions of Western ideals in the region and let the locals decide for themselves which ideology they want to be a part of. Isreal&#x27;s main problem in this regard is how they treat the Palestinians, but I&#x27;m optimistic that they&#x27;ll eventually work it out. If Isrealis can figure out how to adopt welcoming stances to non-Jewish immigrants, they could become an even bigger magnet for youth than the terror organizations.",1448053628

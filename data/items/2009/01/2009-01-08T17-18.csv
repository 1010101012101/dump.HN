425252,comment,424971,424971,0,0,cchooper,,,"If you want to learn from a book (as opposed to memorising a shopping list or something) then the advice is always the same: get an overview first, then notice the details. Facts seem to need an overall framework in which they can ""live"". Without it, they get lost.<p>A standard technique goes like this: read just the first and last paragraphs of each chapter. Then read the first sentence of each paragraph of the first chapter. Then read the actual chapter as fast as you can (don't focus on details or bits you don't understand). Finally, go through it one last time and make notes. Now go on to the next chapter.<p>However, if you truly want to memorise an astounding number of facts (e.g. a list of a thousand pieces of information, or all the common words in a foreign language), then you need to use sophisticated mnemonic techniques. It takes a little practice, but you get surprising results very quickly. For example, after about 15 minutes practising the techniques in this book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Use-Your-Memory-Understand-Improve/dp/1406610186/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Use-Your-Memory-Understand-Improve/d...</a>, I was able to memorise the order of a shuffled deck of cards with about 95% accuracy.

Learning Dvorak forced me to touch type and rest on the home keys properly. Using a ""normal"" keyboard also meant I couldn't cheat and look at the keys when using Dvorak.<p>Probably due to now touch typing, Dvorak is faster for me (and more comfy). I'm forced to use Qwerty often enough however that I can switch between the two fairly easily.<p>I'm in the UK but use the US-Dvorak layout as that is standard with Windows. I'm therefore missing the pound sign but ALT-156 gets me through the odd occasions I need it. I have tried the UK version on Linux but couldn't find the exact same layout for Windows and am too lazy to re-create it myself. The US version is good enough for me.<p>I tend to use the old DOS style keys for cut/copy/paste (Shift-Delete, Ctrl-Insert, Shift-Insert) due to the odd xcv layout others have mentioned. I learnt emacs after the switch so the layout seems fine to me. I haven't taken the time to learn VI.<p>Windows is a little awkward as switching layout with the taskbar icon only changes the active window and changing the default input language seems to miss things like the start menu.<p>I think an ergo keyboard is the next step (I can feel my wrists are pushed into a slightly unnatural position) but am yet to try one.

I've had to do business planning work for products I managed, and what the CEOs wanted was Excel. You might look <i>more</i> professional for not coming to them with a three-ring binder.<p>With that said, and with the <i>huge</i> caveat that while I've done this before, my advice might not be the current hotness:<p>(.) You need a table for revenue growth, quarter by quarter, in your case probably based on users and conversion rate scenarios.<p>(.) You might consider a seperate table for pricing; of all the things you write in the plan, pricing is the most likely to change, but do a couple scenarios, keep conversion/close rate in mind.<p>(.) If it makes sense for your product, segment the market and get that in a table; you might do, ""home office"", ""small business"", ""enterprise"", and have a pricing/phase-1/phase-2 revenue scenario for each model customer based on your pricing. Include a SWAG total addressable market size (there are, say, 2000-4000 ""enterprises"" to sell to).<p>(.) You can do a schedule table, quarter by quarter, and use it to set a conversion rate for each market segment, to chart featuresets in your product, when they'll be released, and what releasing them will do to your cash flow.<p>(.) If you have significant marketing expenses, break them down into line items quarter by quarter, showing some things kicking in later. You can break this down by outreach mechanism (direct mail, blogging, AdWords, research).<p>(.) You need a table for headcount; we just SWAG a common (somewhat lowball) fully loaded cost for everyone from management to QA; remember fully loaded adds (say) 30% for taxes, health insurance, and equipment/office/overhead.<p>(.) You need a table for all your expenses, quarter by quarter, which should include headcount, a line item for hosting/bandwidth/server/etc, marketing,<p>(.) I'm probably missing something, but with all that, you should be able to do a final seperate sheet, call it ""use of proceeds"", broken down by engineering, opex (hosting etc), sales, and administrative costs, quarter by quarter, against revenue.<p>Of all the things you ""plan"" now, pricing is the most likely to change, so don't get too hung up.<p>Lowball your headcount.

Exactly <i>1</i> asked for a business plan and they were the lowest quality entity with the least success/experience.<p>Fred Wilson (one of the top consumer VCs in the world) said that 17 out of 26 of his ""successful"" investments (with exits) utterly changed their business model between investment and exit.  In other words, a business plan has a roughly 60% chance of being obsolete.<p>Planning is good.  You should rough out some numbers.  Build a spreadsheet or two.  If it's ad supported, get a sense of CPMs in your market and try to figure out how many ad views you'd need to support a real business.  If it's a B2B offering, rough out what you can charge, investigate low cost distribution angles (SEO, SEM, etc).  In short, prove to yourself (and others) that your business has some legs to stand on.<p>Write this down in an executive summary and be able to talk about it in some more detail...  But writing a formal business plan?  Chances are you don't know what business you're really in yet.  And if you think you do, there are pretty good odds that you're wrong.<p>Of course, if you have a mature startup (a year or two old, a pile of customers), then some more structured planning might be appropriate.",1231435950

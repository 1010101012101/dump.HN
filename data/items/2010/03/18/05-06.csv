John Maynard Smith introduced the idea of a evolutionarily stable strategy. The idea is to use the classic game theory payoff matrix successively to determine a stable mix of strategies used by the population. Some payoff matrix aren't stable since one of the strategies can dominate the others and causing the dominated strategy to be extinct in the population.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy</a><p>The types of strategy typically discussed are:<p><pre><code>  * Doves (always peaceful)\n  * Hawks (always attack)\n  * Bully (feign attack)\n  * Retaliator (peaceful until attacked)</code></pre>",1268889306

Here's my (admittedly incomplete) laundry list:<p>* You should know (really really know) one language - preferably one conducive to writing web applications. PHP, Python, Ruby, Java and <i>.NET seem to be the ones in vogue today. Perl, Haskell, Scheme, Smalltalk, as well as several others, will absolutely work too, but tooling seem to be somewhat a step behind, at least when compared w/ the ones in the first group.<p></i> You should know Javascript. Not jQuery, Prototype, or MooTools. You should know web_developer.prototype.javascript.<p>* You should have great communication skills. Arguably, the ability to clearly and eloquently express yourself is sine qua non for (being successful at) doing pretty much anything that involves other people but, given that the bar seems to be considerably lower for us folks in traditionally left-brain professions, I feel obliged to mention it.<p>* You should have a knack for aesthetics, and be familiar w/ interface design and usability. You don't necessarily need to be able to produce aesthetically pleasing, usable anything, but you should be able to _know it when you see it_. And this is a lot less subjective than conventional wisdom would have you believe.<p>* You should have an understanding of how to store and retrieve data, what sort of operations are expensive when querying, and be able to model at least simple schemas.<p>* You should be able to write concise, uniform looking markup and css (or (and?) be familiar w/ the myriad use tools that can make this considerably easier for you).<p>* You should enjoy it.<p>Also Helpful:<p>* A background in Comp Sci will presumably give you some knowledge of design patterns (more helpful than algorithms for most web development work out there today, in my experience), a familiarity w/ different languages and general approaches, and the ability to write somewhat decoupled, modular, testable code amongst a few others.<p>* Being naturally curious, as well as enjoying it, will help you keep up with a fairly fast-evolving landscape of different standards, platforms and approaches.",1268889294

1200533,comment,1200389,1200501,0,0,kinetik,,,"GIF is a different situation.  It was already a well established format before Unisys started enforcing the patent it held on it.  The patent was a ""submarine"" patent, so it was not publically known before the format became widely used.  It's also worth pointing out that the GIF fiasco was well underway (1993-1999) before Mozilla ever existed.  The Mozilla organization formed in 1998, and was mostly influenced by the vast number of participating Netscape employees until 2002-2003.  By 2003 Unisys's patent had expired.<p>If anything, Mozilla's stance towards H.264 is an attempt to avoid the web ending up in a similar situation it did with GIF, where the format was deeply entrenched before the companies controlling the licensing began asking users to pay license fees.  The MPEG-LA's recent announcement that internet streaming would remain free until 2015 is a direct attempt to achieve further entrenchment of the format.  There is a very real possibility that they will ask for licensing fees come 2015.  And we have no idea how much they might cost.  Even with free streaming, most of the people in the video production chain need to pay license fees to the MPEG-LA right now.",1268888941

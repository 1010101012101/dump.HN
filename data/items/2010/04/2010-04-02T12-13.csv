I don't want to miss anything and want to be naturally know the whole picture.<p>pg's ""How to fund a startup"" <http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html> is a good start, but I was wondering if there were any other important/good resources you all could point me and others too.<p>tl;dr: Got any good -- preferably online -- resources to learn about startup funding, seed cycles and the like?",1270213064

1236340,comment,1236214,1236214,0,0,rauljara,,,"The technology they demonstrate is impressive and clever.  That's just a neat way to improve GUI's.  But what they use their method to do (implement bubble cursor and sticky icons) seems like it would harm usability.  With bubble cursor, the downside is that any accidental click of the mouse (those happen with touch pads on laptops) is guaranteed to trigger some gui element.  Also, if you are in the midpoint of two gui elements, a tiny, tiny shift in the mouse could lead to clicking the wrong thing.  Which could be very back when the ""save draft"" and ""discard"" buttons are right next to each other, as in gmail.  The upside is... that I don't have to move my mouse quite as far?  Bur if not having to move your mouse as far is a good thing, why implement that sticky elements feature, which guarantees you will have to move your mouse much farther after moving over an element?  Both the bubbles and sticky things seem designed to make ui elements much easier to click on, but unless you have muscle control problems (which I suppose some people do, especially the elderly) I don't think that's generally a good thing.  There are too many buttons that do things that you just can't undo.",1270211381

So in the US, they're not allowed to unfairly favor one company over another (at least there are rules trying to prevent it).  This makes the steak and strippers kind of selling illegal, and employees of contracting companies are legally required to go through training on how not to bribe officials.  Companies have to re-compete for contracts they've already won.

I think that this critique falls far short of what doctorow had to say on the topic. My eyes quickly glazed over when the action cut to theil playing the role of neocon libertarian dr. evil teaming up with the singularity institute and thevanguard.org to destroy reality.  It seems that a large part of the author's problem with facebook is the political views of its investors.",1200329717

Very seldom does it contain new releases or movies I'd ordinarily think to add to my queue.<p>Additionally the online streaming feature only works in IE for Windows, which is a pain (for me).<p>I guess it remains to be seen what, if anything, Apple is going to bring to the table, but there are obvious opportunities to improve on the Netflix model.",1200328774

They bear the risk of having that happen, and in return, they soak up the profits when they get to charge the contractee for 60 hours worked in a week and still pay only salary to their own employees.<p>In the case with which I'm most familiar, the contract is for two days a week at $50/hr, and the employee of the contractor company gets ~$12/hr (here in the deep south, that's livable; he owns his own home).  That may sound terrible to you, but on days they don't have anything for him to do, he still gets paid.  It's a tradeoff.",1200327749

It makes no sense to take pay in common stock since (unlike holders of preferred shares) you'll lose it all if the startup fails.",1200327603

Many just for playing around on, or at friends houses (the Atari and the T/I's).<p>The PCjr is always bashed, especially for the keyboard, but I never understood that.  For starters mine had the ""real"" keyboard in addition to the chiclet keyboard.  I also knew a few other folks with jr's, and never remember anyone using the chiclet keyboard.  I must've written a couple hundred thousand lines of BASIC on my jr, and interfaced it to all kinds of peripherals, and later other PCs in the house.<p>The PET brought back fond memories, I taught myself to program (more or less by looking at other BASIC programs for examples) on one of those.  My first ""application"" was to display a calendar for the month of November... I finished it in February ;)",1200326682

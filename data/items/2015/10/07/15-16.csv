We love deleting code, but we hate deleting tests, because it gives us this feeling of insecurity. The sort of test that you do during refactoring doesn’t lend itself well to maintaining code over time. You’re going to be a lot more granular in your tests. You’re going to be testing things that are outside of the purview of normal integration or unit tests, and it’s important that you feel comfortable throwing those away when you’re done with a refactoring effort.<p>If you&#x27;re throwing away a lot of your tests, that&#x27;s generally a sign that your tests and your code are too tightly coupled.",1444233477

10346746,comment,10345231,10345915,0,0,nmrm2,,,"Furthermore, the obsession with mid-career salaries is misplaced. Four problems:<p>1. Focusing on the mid-career salaries can over-value college. Without longer-running longitudinal data, you&#x27;re essentially just measuring whether colleges / universities provide people with skills that are in high demand in the decade or so following graduation. That says absolutely nothing about the critical back half of people&#x27;s careers, when they should be earning more than ever and putting a lot of it away for retirement and/or funding the higher education (or business ventures etc.) of their children and/or investing in or starting new businesses.<p>2. It reeks of (bad) central planning. Is it any surprise that Software Engineers are in such short supply and Lawyers in such over-supply? People were just making &quot;rational&quot; choices when shying away from CS following the dot com bubble burst, and now we have a massive under-supply of skilled software engineers (and, conversely, an over-supply of other types of professions that were supposed to be highly paid). And in X years, everyone&#x27;s going to shut up about STEM when there&#x27;s a dip and it&#x27;s hard to find a high paying job in software. And then we&#x27;ll be asking why all these idiots are taking out loans to get degrees in CS.<p>3. Focusing on the mid-career under-values college. Many of the benefits of a well-rounded education -- improved writing, increased awareness of one&#x27;s own culture and others&#x27; cultures, familiarity with different fields, interaction with people who have varying interests, deep connections to people who go into other industries -- are skills that pay dividents <i>especially</i> long after the mid-point in a career. The last one or two decades of a career are when employees are being paid for their insight, discipline, awareness of both the big picture and details, and ability to communicate in addition or even instead of rote technical skills that came from their major.<p>4. Salary is a poor indicator for the value-add of college at the societal level. If we&#x27;re going to go down this (ill-advised) route, we should also be measuring things like health of family life, degree to which people contribute back to their community (by taking on voluntary leadership roles), etc.",1444233413

But in effect, practical &quot;compromises&quot; can often serve both goals better than a single purists solution.<p>I happen to believe in both liberty and public health.<p>In practice, vaccinations against infectious diseases need to hit certain percentages, not 100% of the population. With free vaccination, post natal health care, school programs and public education campaigns we can hit those numbers, and we do so regularly.<p>There&#x27;s no need for the gross violation of freedom some people fear, locking up parents or declaring them unfit, tying people to a chair and needling them. Doing this voluntarily puts more onus on the system to be smart and high functioning, invest in education and making people comfortable with the whole thing. It increases the pressure to reduce side effects, inconvenience, cost, fear and any other barrier to getting kids vaccinated. Generally, the whole thing works better.<p>The fundamentalist is not serving principles more faithfully than the centrist or pragmatist. She&#x27;s often just being argumentative and trying to be right to the detriment of her principles.<p>Declaring all state involvement  or authority to be (equally?) coercive and violent is silly, thinking in discreet categories when the world of human beings is fuzzy. Ignoring people&#x27;s agency in the decision to vaccinate them or their children is an obvious violation is a basic morally deafness.<p>I see comments like these from smart people who think more deeply about such things than the average person. It&#x27;s baffling. Almost makes me think that the whole enterprise of moral philosophy and political philosophy is counter-productive. People fall into traps of vainly searching for consistency and leave their moral sense behind, with common sense far behind.<p>TLDR: There is no reason to forgo obesity for vaccination or vaccination for freedom. People are motivated into these arguments by a desire to be right, not to help people be free or healthy.",1444233275

10346558,comment,10345589,10345589,0,0,bzbarsky,,,"There&#x27;s a lot of good advice here, but also some misinformation.<p>First of all, a script tag will block DOM construction, but in any sane modern browser will not block loading of subresources like stylesheets, because browsers speculatively parse the HTML and kick off those loads even while they&#x27;re waiting for the script.  So the advice to put CSS before JS is not necessarily good advice.  In fact, if your script is not async it&#x27;s actively _bad_ advice because while the CSS load will start even before the JS has loaded, the JS will NOT run until the CSS has loaded.  So if you put your CSS link before your JS link and the JS is not async, the running of the JS will be blocked on the load of the CSS.  If you revers the order, then the JS will run as soon as it&#x27;s loaded, and the CSS will be loading in parallel with all of that anyway.<p>Second, making your script async will help with some things (like DOMContentLoaded firing earlier and perhaps getting something up in front of the user), but can hurt with other things (time to load event firing and getting the things the user will actually see up), because it can cause the browser to lay out the page once, and then lay it out _again_ when the script runs and messes with the DOM.  So whether it makes sense to make a script async really depends on what the script does.  If it&#x27;s just loading a bunch of not-really-used library code, that&#x27;s one thing, but if it modifies the page content that&#x27;s a very different situation.<p>Third, the last bullet point about using DomContentLoaded instead of $(document).ready() makes no sense, at least for jQuery.  jQuery fires $(document).ready() stuff off the DomContentLoaded event.<p>The key thing for making pages faster from my point of view is somewhat hidden in the article, but it&#x27;s this:<p>> This isn&#x27;t even that much JavaScript in web terms - 37kb gzipped.<p>Just send less script.  A lot less.  The less script you&#x27;re sending, the less likely it is that your script is doing something dumb to make things slow.<p>[Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a browser engine developer, not a frontend or full-stack web developer.]",1444231563

Similarly, see chrisseaton&#x27;s comments example on this thread.<p>> If it instead compiled all code with the optimizing compiler AOT, the JIT part wouldn&#x27;t be needed and you would get just as fast code.<p>So why do you think they do that? :) The reason is that many optimizations are not available to an AOT compiler. An AOT compiler can optimize something only if it can prove that no matter what happens, the optimization will preserve semantics. A JIT can do <i>speculative</i> optimizations, i.e. optimizations that may change semantics and may not always be true, but would be true if the program behaves as it has so far. A JIT can do that because if its assumptions are wrong, it can deoptimize. Many, many abstractions are candidates for speculative but not definitive optimizations, such as virtual function calls, pattern matching, if statements etc.<p>> JIT can only beat AOT if you can exploit patterns in the dataflow of the program. Doing that profitably (i.e. the optimization must save more time than it costs to perform) is incredibly hard.<p>That is what pretty much what all (good) modern JITs do. But, as I said, a JIT is indeed more complex than an AOT compiler. Thankfully we now have great frameworks such as Graal/Truffle and RPython that take almost all the pain out of creating a good JIT (or a good compiler in general).",1444231415

For no good reason I did XYZ, now listen to my detailed rationalization based on emotions or Vulcan-level logic, which doesn&#x27;t really matter because I really have no idea why I asked ABC out on a date or decided to buy that car or eat that second piece of birthday cake, although in detailed post-rationalization I can dream up all kinds of sand castles in the sky explaining elaborate logical reasons or stark emotions that I supposedly experienced before I made a random decision.  This adds an annoying second level of analysis, why do some people do random things just like everyone else, but their societal or cultural failure is rationalizing it as logic or admitting it was just random, whereas &quot;everyone knows&quot; we must, at least in public, declare it to be the result of emotion.",1444230492

Is it acceptable to break in to someone else&#x27;s system for the purposes of preventing other people with unknowable motives from breaking in, or to stop a break-in already in progress?<p>For a full answer, I also need to answer some other questions.  Is there any way to contact the owner of the device that has a reasonable chance of success?  Are there any reasons why the owner might leave the device in an unsecured state intentionally?  Is the device spreading harm to others because it is insecure?  Is the owner aware that the device is not secure?<p>I decided that the scenario was analogous not just to someone leaving their car doors unlocked in a high-crime neighborhood, but to a medical quarantine.  An unlocked car doesn&#x27;t really hurt anyone else, but an unaware carrier of a contagious pathogen is dangerous to himself and to others.  It then becomes more acceptable to force treatment on an unwilling or unaware person, for the sake of public health.<p>As a result, I figured that a program like the following would be ethically acceptable, but not necessarily virtuous:<p><pre><code>  - uses a single specific vulnerability to compromise systems\n  - immediately patches the vulnerability out of an infected system\n  - attempts to detect and remove any known malware\n  - goes dormant for a variable amount of time\n  - attempts to infect other systems at a slow rate for a fixed amount of time\n  - removes itself from the infected system\n  - leaves behind a human-readable log of its activity\n</code></pre>\nIt would also be helpful for it to be accompanied by a fix for the vulnerability in the official device update stream.",1444230457

Every once in awhile I&#x27;ll have to do something that doesn&#x27;t make sense to build into the app, so I&#x27;ll come up with a procedure for doing it at a data level. Usually these are processes that run weekly / monthly / quarterly.<p>The first time I come up with a manual procedure. The second time I try to automate some of it. Then over the next few iterations I fix issues with the automation, as that step inevitably produces edge cases. They&#x27;ll need special cases that I&#x27;ll have to work into the tool.<p>Eventually this produces a command-line tool with appropriate help text and a README that outlines what the tool does, why, and what edge cases are present.<p>I used to wait until it was almost a finished product before writing the documentation, but as I get lazier and lazier, I just don&#x27;t care to dive into the code I wrote last month, I just want a procedure for getting it done and going back to screwing around.<p>So the first time I have to do this, I take notes of all the manual steps I took to perform it in a markdown document. How did I massage the CSV, which fields did I add, so on and so forth. This has the side effect of making writing automation code way way easier the next time around. Next time I do it, I look at it and I&#x27;m like, &quot;WTF Vince, why didn&#x27;t you note that the date field can change formats?&quot;<p>I, myself, am that person without domain knowledge, every single time I go back and do something I might have done even yesterday.

You then have to npm install (assuming you have node installed). You then have to npm install sharp. But before sharp can work, you have to npm install node-gyp. But in before that can work, you have to make sure you&#x27;re using a specific version of Python, specific versions of Visual Studio (2010 and 2015 both seem to fail), an SDK, and then run some console commands to set the WindowsSDKDir.<p>After you spend 30 minutes downloading and uninstalling and re-installing different version of Visual Studio and SDKs and sorting out other error messages, you&#x27;re finally back to trying to install sharp. You install sharp, but wait, then you need to download this zip file and change your environment variables and PATH variables, which you have to Google to remember how to do each time because it&#x27;s done so rarely.<p>This is obviously all feasible and to an experienced developer not intimidating, but for someone who&#x27;s on a Windows machine and new to node, it doesn&#x27;t seem like simply getting a package running should be this difficult in 2015.

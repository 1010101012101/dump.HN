Years ago we had the ""X reasons to"" lists, now we have ""I'm very humble to be the best"".

2570921,comment,2565664,2566102,2,0,pickettd,,,"The TLS handshake is to work out identities and exactly what type of encryption etc they want/support. Then before sending any actual data they encrypt a ""Finished"" message and both sides verify they can read the message. The server will only be able to create a correct ""Finished"" message if it has the private key to go along with the presented certificate.<p>It seems to me like the overt change in the handshake security boundary is that in a FalseStart handshake, a man-in-the-middle attacker can make the initiating side send application data encrypted with relatively arbitrary parameters (until the TLS implementation realizes it can't decrypt the final handshake message properly). There is a good chance this is just <i>annoying</i> (like, on a denial-of-service level of attack) but my intuition is there could be some application circumstances where this is a significant problem. Off the top of my head I can't come up with a specific example however - so I could just be imagining things :)<p>There are also operating system/application level architecture challenges as well. For example, I'm not sure the idea of FalseStart is compatible with the calling convention of Windows SSL/TLS (InitializeSecurityContext and AcceptSecurityContext) given the separation between transport layer and security context negotiation components. And because of that existing convention, the recommendation in sections 4 and 5 of the draft that ""TLS implementations allow the application layer to query whether the handshake has completed"" could be potentially tricky for applications using Schannel (Windows SSL/TLS).<p>""Creating an Schannel Security Context"" : <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374781(v=VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374781(v=VS.85).as...</a>",1305988340

Also, me and most people in robotics spend most of their time programing, they are not trained programmers. Unfortunately many use this as an excuse to keep writing crappy code instead of trying to catch up with the state of the art. Heck, right now I'm the only one in my group who uses version control ...",1305986768

The last time I checked some states like Utah that are much more poorly served by ILECs and cable companies have healthy municipal level broadband efforts.<p>On the other hand Utah has 1/3 the population of NC, the stakes are much lower there.  But I don't see how corruption of this sort is likely to spread widely, especially given how hard it was to just pass this law in NC (several years and several tries as I recall).",1305986675

I doubt there are any ethical benefits in storing the data in such a way that they (the service providers) can read it. Even if there is I doubt that users would agree to such usage.",1305986520

T420s might also do this, you should check. One of the Dell Latitudes also implemented a hardware multiplexer in addition to Optimus and thus people have been able to get the Nvidia card running under Linux though without switching ability (but thats still vastly better than no card).<p>I have been waiting for AMD Llano based laptops as I will be able to run them without any worries about switchable graphics. I need OpenCL and OpenGL support for work purposes.",1305986403

Obviously there was some adjusting to do, having different quirks than I was used to.<p>As a code editor, it's lacking a lot of things like effective keyboard-shortcuts.  There are a few gestures that are already in place, and I like the ability to quickly save with a right-click which brings up a wheel of options.  The last time I used it was maybe Feb so I'm sure there have been a lot of changes to this.<p>As a file manager, I think this is where Bespin shines brightest.  The ability to fetch and put files from remote servers is brilliantly executed; though lacking-I'd like to be able to unpackage web directories that I grab from my FTP server, but the fact alone that this exists given the form of Bespin (web based) was a huge deal for me.  A lot of the file management options are replicated both in a GUI file tree and a CLI dialog box.  Again, this is probably the strongest features of Bespin.<p>Long story short: yes it does have quite a ways to go, but with the progress that's been made so far, I think when Mozilla releases RC1 it will probably be a damn good contender for code editing.<p>/note: I have not used the collaboration features, so obviously no comment is made on that.",1274741608

ML almost always involves large datasets <i>in practical use</i>, but when you're trying to come up with a new method for ensuring correctness in some edge-case, you would be testing it with hypothetical extreme inputs, not feeding it mounds of data that won't trigger the problem. Haskell works well to model computer science research problems—that is, research <i>into</i> CS, not <i>using</i> CS <i>to</i> research other domains.

It's true that it isn't the reliability that I would want for critical files, but many things are non-critical.  For example: YouTube stores multiple copies of every file (the original, 360p, 480p, potentially 720p and 1080p and potentially using multiple codecs).  One copy is ""critical"".  The others are nice to have.  On a site like that, you can make the original and the 360p critical so that you're always able to serve the video and you always have the original and then if you need to regenerate the 720p version, you just do that and really people can wait an hour - especially since it still <i>works</i>, albeit at 360p.<p>Likewise, think about the thumbnails that Facebook stores of images.  If one of them disappears, it can be regenerated.  There's no reason to store so many copies.<p>Amazon's new service level shouldn't be used for data you want to keep absolutely safe.  It should be used for data that you can regenerate if it disappears since it will save you money.

The way it does this is to print black copies (which get cleaned off the drum, straight into the waste toner container).<p>I'm not saying don't use the toner cartridge until it's completely empty, since sometimes the sensors do misdetect the toner level and report it empty when there is a small amount left - just don't over do it.",1274740377

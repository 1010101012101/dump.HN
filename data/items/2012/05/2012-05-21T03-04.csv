Would it be possible to make your coding progress <i>and</i> get the social benefits and memories and all that kind of stuff?<p>I'm not sure what the answer is, but I know that there are more possibilities out there than 1) follow the traditional US college path and 2) don't go to college and start working  full time straight away.",1337572797
4001216,comment,4000630,4001128,3,0,jbigelow76,,,"""I think you underestimate the disruptive potential that Stripe gives. Dealing with payments is one of the biggest pain points that a lot of people have when putting together a new web venture.""<p>No offense but I think this statement shows exactly what makes Stripe so non-disruptive. Stripe has targeted a niche, not a vertical. Payment processing exists beyond the needs of new web ventures. The majority of businesses (brick and mortars) can't even make use of stripe without a VAR or OEM acting as a middle man, and at that point where is the value that stripe brings to the table? The savings will be eaten up by the middle man.<p>Stripe may be great for a small development shop cranking out mobile and web apps (I'm their target market, I'm considering using it for my SaaS myself) but once a business  starts to scale saving a quarter or half percentage point on processing fees by using something like auth.net makes sense when weighed against the usability of stripe from a developer perspective.",1337572755

There are different kinds of education... going through one channel that people believe to be the largest and most correct, isn't always right for everyone.  However, it is a small minority of people that can recognize that that specific path isn't right for them at the end of High School (U.S. model).  I went through 4 years of ""upper education"" knowing I was going to be a coder from the start and in the end of it all I do believe that I would have be a better programmer if I had not gone through all those years of college and just started coding for someone else's ideas.  However, from a social standpoint, I would not trade those 4 years back for a million bucks.  They are great memories and although I feel I lost those years in hard core coding advancement - I gained a lot of skills for navigating the world.   I was also lucky enough to get a free ride.

I don't know much about airplanes but a few things seems off when I think of this design in terms of basic physics.<p>The ""boxwings"" seem to be a worst of both world approach. It ads a lot of surface going across the air and thus a lot of drag, without providing the width which would usually make available the torque necessary for stability and control.<p>Torque is (force * distance) and, for roll control, this distance is usually provided by wide wings. An airplane having shorter wings would probably go through the air more efficiently (provided you didn't add a second set of wings on top of the first one) but would not provide much control to enable safe flight in all possible conditions. Short wings don't provide much leverage on the roll axis.<p>It also seems like in this design the top part of the ""boxwings"" plays the role of the tail of the plane. However, it looks like we get the same (force * distance) problem but on the pitch axis. In order for the tail to give a good amount of torque for pitch control, it has to be located away from the wings and the center of the aircraft.<p>Again, I'm just guessing based on physics here but since there is no tail other than the one located near the bottom wings, it might be difficult to stop the plane from pitching up or down out of control.<p>If we were to design planes for efficiency only, they would look like arrows or missile. They would have minimal wings or fins to slow them down. The reason, we have to have things sticking out far from their middle, is to add the ability to safely control them in a wide variety of conditions.<p>This aircraft has both lots of wing, thus a lot of drag and yet the extra wingage doesn't get the wings positioned away from the center where they would add the most stability and control. Unless the ""Laminar Flow"", ""Wake Propulsion"", ""Open Thermodynamics"", ""Subsonic Area Ruling"" or the other technobably things mentioned on the website somehow compensate for this, it seems like a lose-lose design.",1337571759

I'm probably not representative of everyone in technology without a college degree, but nevertheless, when I realized Dream #1 wasn't happening, I tool my tech experience in retail to the start-up world, and then settled in to a decent career, which is only getting better with time. Part of me agrees with all this, but with a grain of salt. It's not the path for everyone. Put me in a room of geeks and I can hold my own; put me in a group of more well-rounded folks, fans of opera and the like (tongue in cheek, folks), I couldn't hold my own and would be bored to death. But that's not just due to personal taste, but a total lack of exposure.<p>My mother never encouraged me to go to school and I spent all my time in my room reading SciFi and Fantasy novels. But I was very smart, and now that I have a kid of my own, I see that same intelligence in her and, guess what, I'm sending her to college. No matter what. She'll have opportunities to do great things, and I wouldn't fault her for pausing college to work on a start-up company, but I would fault her for not finishing school, even if it took a decade or two. See, I want her to be able to sit in that room with all the socialites and hold her own, as easily as she could in a room full of geeks. That said, until the United States improves its view of education and makes some radical changes, my daughter will NOT be going to college in the States. Maybe University of Helsinki? :)<p>Good luck to all the Thiel Fellows. I think it is needed, for both an _alternative_ and as a reminder to folks in the States that there is a serious problem with the education system...",1337571404

The truth is that, with XSS, any action a user may do on the vulnerable site (that doesn't require a password) can be mimicked.<p>With an XSS vector in the board title (meaning the JavaScript would be injected into the page listing all boards) it would be possible to force all visitors to participate in a DDoS attack against this site. If I'm not mistaken, it would be possible to force the participation in a DDoS against ANY site. I'm fairly certain that cross-site ajax works fine in modern browsers, but without cookies to prevent abuse- cookies are not necessary for DDoS.<p>Edit/Note: This does mean that any site could force visitors to participate in a DDoS attack. What prevents this from becoming common is the number of visitors required for a DDoS attack to succeed.<p>This would probably not work on this site because the number of users is only ~6000. I don't know how many users would actually be required to dent a typical site. I do know that ""Anonymous"" recently used a client side DDoS tool on a large number of users.<p>Edit 2: In light of <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4000301"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4000301</a>, I'll point out that XSS could result in the forced posting of illegal content, as well.",1337569723

The Euro is compared to the US dollar. The Japanese Yen is compared to the British Pound. Etc. So it is normal to compare Bitcoin to other currencies.<p>No it&#x27;s not. As a user of a currency, you should have to compare it to other currencies to know how much it&#x27;s worth. You know how much it&#x27;s worth by what goods and services it buys you. Don&#x27;t believe me? Next time ask someone on the street how many Japanese Yen a USD is worth.

But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ontologically possible for a person to own something like these logos. Such ownership is a legal fiction set up by legal traditions whose intellectual property protections have started to become more of a problem than a solution.  Their remaining relevance it seems to me is to empower corporations such as IBM and Microsoft to extract rent (in the context of patents), and to give money to attorneys and politicians and lobbyists.  It is hard for me to have much sympathy for the notion that such protections are in place in the present context primarily for artist making the logo (in the case of trademark, etc.) when there are so many other interests that hang just a little bit back in the background.<p>In most cases on the site the copies are undeniably in bad taste.

The Apple acquisition makes sense, as it helps to add another input device for what I suspect will be an Apple TV. For the most part, everyone has hands and arms. To enable your hands to control what&#x27;s showing on the screen seems in theory to be quite practical.<p>On the flip side, playing games is one thing.... controlling your TV is a different story altogether. I&#x27;m not sure how great an experience it will be. Samsung already has gesture controls on some of their camera-equipped TVS. The experience of waving your hands around for control can actually get a bit tiring.<p>It will be interesting to find out how Apple plans to integrate this technology into their devices.",1385015453

True they are simple, but it is impossible to imagine someone creating the same thing without knowing the original. There is practically an unlimited number of ways one can convey a logo.

There is some optimization that you can do on PNGs, but for most media encoded with a lossy method you shouldn&#x27;t be able to achieve a smaller filesize without reencoding with another lossy method (and by definition losing more information, althoughh it might not significantly decrease the percieved quality)",1385014107

It must be optimized for its specific tasks. You just can't get that from a general package.<p>In retrospect, it's not surprising that they're optimizing some parts with assembler - even SSE (Streaming  SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) Extensions <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions</a>), which I hadn't heard of, but which is the kind of vector parallelism that gives supercomputers their speed.",1236848014
513203,comment,513081,513110,0,0,noaharc,,,"5,580,000 is intuitively a ridiculous number, and the reason they use it is that their definition of startup is incredibly lax.<p>First, they're looking at businesses of all types, not just the scalable, tech-oriented businesses that we typically consider startups.  The states with the most entrepreneurial activity, by their metric, were ""Montana, Mississippi, Georgia, Oklahoma and Maine"".  Pretty clear we're not dealing with startups then.<p>Second, they are counting (or attempting to, anyway) all businesses, incorporated or unincorporated.  Everything from your neighbor's babysitter to Bechtolsheim's latest, I guess.<p>So, pretty much worthless.  But it did get our attention.",1236847924

There are more followers than leaders, be the leader and start now rather than waste time.<p>People are more likely to feel like they are missing out when you're willing to do it with or without them. You have to sell yourself a bit not just the idea to instill a certain confidence in others.",1236847542

513190,comment,513186,513186,0,0,suhail,,,"I imagine this is going to be a tough sell, prove you can ship early, fast, and iteratively and that there is no way you'll stop trying (even if you're living on other people's couches).<p>With that, that's a difficult story to tell if you're starting today--you may have to wait for the next round.<p>My personal opinion: Start by yourself, produce 2-3 iterations of your product, your friends will follow when they see the idea start to come to fruition. No way someone is going to deny you an opportunity with that much heart, a solid demo, and some early indicators of success. I think you have to gun it alone before you can really prove to them that you're not easily demoralized.<p>This is coming from someone who used to be a single founder himself, good luck--there's hope =)",1236846588

There ought to be something there for them to help pull them up and get them going again.",1236845759
513186,story,,,5,10,cthan323,"Ask HN: Any advice for single founders applying for YC Summer '09 round?",,"I'm currently an undergrad graduating in December of this year, and I decided to apply for the YC summer round. Unfortunately, I'll be applying as a single founder as I've failed to convince my friends to renege on their full-time offers from Microsoft and other companies.  They’re not willing to sacrifice the safety of a nice salary in this economy for my untested idea.<p>Google search results revealed that getting funded as a single founder is nearly impossible.   With this in mind, is there any thing that we single founders can do to increase the probability of getting in the YC summer round?  The only thing I can think of is having a working demo ready.  I’m currently hacking out a demo before March 18 comes around, but I feel like that’s the only thing I can do.  Am I just S.O.L.?<p>For the single founders that have been funded, could you provide us (single founders) with some advice on what you did?<p>EDIT: For clarification, I've been developing a demo for several weeks now and it's about 30% there, but I'm starting to ramp up and I'm trying and get as much functionality built before the due date.",1236845651

I don't use it in any serious way because I moved abroad and only have the one US VoIP line.<p>It'd be fantastic (read: I'd pay for it) if they'd forward to international numbers (at VoIP rates).  Even better would be to allow me to add int'l virtual number to my account.<p>We're getting close to phone numbers working like domain names, and I'll be happy when this finally happens.",1236845580

The former is a meme that the baby boomers invented and indoctrinated into their children, resulting in a generation of highly educated barristas. The few that make it into the cushy jobs are the ones who end up complaining constantly, a symptom of inhibiting their natural productive instinct.<p>We <i>need</i> to get shit done. It's primal. And nothing feels more like getting shit done than something disgusting and dangerous. That's why you feel great after you clean the bathroom.<p>The tech industry is an anomoly in that the productive jobs are often also deeply fulfilling. There are a few other jobs like that, but not enough for everyone and they set a bad example for the rest of the working world.",1236845514

5394960,comment,5393588,5394720,1,0,hmsimha,,,"I don't see how it fails to support my argument that by reducing a plant to one or a handful of alkaloids that represent a fraction of the body of the plants chemical makeup, we risk losing out on some of what the plant has to offer. I don't disagree that sometimes, that can be a good thing. However, it's not always; in the case of Marinol ""While there has never been a documented human fatality from overdosing on tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabis in its natural form,[86] Marinol can lead to death""<p>Additionally, the process of isolating and combining the individual components of a plant in order to reproduce observed health benefits of the plant consumed as a whole can be a long and tedious process. Marinol's failure as a good substitute for most people who desire the effects of marijuana is a pretty good example of why, even in this age of science, it is still sometimes better to go back to the source. Green tea extracts, which I also mentioned, frequently consist of Green Tea Catechins, without including, or mentioning whether they contain, L-Theanine, an amino acid in Green tea that has been observed to have nootropic and mood-elevating effects. For someone who wants to reproduce the documented benefits of GTC, by all means go ahead and take the extract. But the benefits of green tea consumed in the traditional way have been enjoyed and observed both in studies over the last few decades, as well as by millions of people over the last thousands of years. Until we've rigorously studied every alkaloid contained in the plant individually, as well as the countless combinations and permutations of those alkaloids (also taking into account the innumerable relative concentrations in which they can be delivered and balanced), it will be hard for science to say whether the components of green tea are present in the most optimal way for X Y Z desired effects",1363622381

5394947,comment,5393367,5394493,4,0,betterunix,,,"""yet I'm sure we'd be mostly stupid and ill-informed about things that we don't know or care about""<p>That is not the issue.  The issue is whether or not we are <i>expected</i> to follow laws that we know nothing about, particularly since ignorance of the law is not considered a valid defense in this country.  If you are not running a farm, you are not expected to adhere to farming regulations and you could not violate those regulations.  On the other hand, if you <i>use</i> a computer -- and the majority of US citizens do -- you <i>are</i> expected to abide by computer laws.<p>Right now, there are a lot of laws that <i>everyone</i> is expected to follow but that few people are aware of.  Most Virginia residents had no idea that opposite-sex cohabitation was illegal when that law was repealed -- millions of people in that state could have faced prosecution for a law they were never aware of (and in the 90s a woman was threatened with prosecution as part of an attempt to shut down her business).  Typically, the police are unaware of these laws and so most people will never be arrested even if they are in violation.  On the other hand, when the government <i>wants</i> to prosecute someone (e.g. Alexander Shulgin), all they need to do is look hard enough to find a law the person violated.  Sometimes the government seeks nothing more than to set a precedent (Aaron Swartz) that would allow them to prosecute others.  That is where the real danger lies:  the government is limited not by the lack of criminal laws but by its own inefficiency in searching the legal code.<p>Most people are entirely unaware of this situation and believe that as long as they are not harming anyone they are safe.  It is hard to raise awareness, because most people do not see anyone being prosecuted in this way, and even when they see it they usually have a hard time feeling sympathy for the defendant (e.g. Lori Drew).  After all, who can feel sorry for someone who collects this sort of artwork:<p><a href=""http://www.japanator.com/man-arrested-for-manga-collection-the-comic-book-legal-defense-fund-will-take-the-case--8753.phtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.japanator.com/man-arrested-for-manga-collection-t...</a>",1363622284

What is 'right' anyway?<p>It is a question you answer further down the page, but I just barely got to that point. The design mostly focuses on how you try to solve a problem when to me as a visitor I don't even know the problem I'm having.<p>Furthermore, I am not entirely sure what you want me to do here. I think you want me to sign-up for an invite, but the call to action to do that is down below and not clearly visible.<p>The ""Say YO!"" button near the bottom of the page looks like an illustration due to the previous content blocks and I wouldn't have expected it to be the desired call to action. Perhaps even rephrase it to just say ""Request an invite"" and drop the ""Have ideas?"" part as that just gives someone another reason not to spend 30 seconds and not to complete the process.<p>Add a call to action to the lightbox showing the video. Else you're asking me to close the lightbox first and then look for whatever you're trying me to do.<p>I would reorganize the left hand side navigation as I think it greatly takes the attention away from the main pitch.<p>Remove the poll.

Beautiful networks that use anycast and a single network protocol to manage distribution of load also have a single point of failure.

For example, where I work (zulily) there is a ton to do. I think about all the cool problems I get to solve. But at the same time, I have to deal with a lot of ""not how I would have done it"" solutions. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that any decisions that I make will be castigated by current/future workers (the wheels on the bus go round and round).<p>With that said, find an industry that interests you right now. Find companies that are using software to solve problems in that industry. Then just start working. When you are there, you have 2 outcomes - one is that everything is amazing and nothing needs to change (unlikely) and the second is that it's mostly OK.<p>If it's mostly OK, you can decide to put up with it (because the challenges and coding are tilting in the favor of happiness) or you can (cliche alert) be the change you want to see. If you see a process that you don't get, question it and find out why it got instituted. If no one can give you a good reason (and good is subjective I know), then change it. Get rid of it. Nuke it from orbit (it's the only way to be sure). If your boss says things like ""Because I said so"" - find somewhere else to work.<p>A lot of people will tell you ""Just code on side projects"". That's an awesome idea. but you can work on side projects about 2-3 hours a day (assuming you've got friends and other hobbies). Is that 2 hours a day really enough to make up for the soul sucking 8+ hours you spend at an office? I know it isn't for me. I've got side projects, but most of them revolve around how I can learn a new technology to help the company I'm currently working for.<p>And just to answer your original question: Yes.

The reason that these suggestions make sense is that Firefox allows plugins and extensions which CAN allow for these things.<p>Perhaps the moral of the story is to build your software with layers of configurability. In layer one, there are hardly any choices, but there is an ""advanced"" button to allow further configuration. In layer 2, there are many more options, but still only ""frequently-used"" features... however, there is a plug-in or scripting system that allows adding additional features if a developer makes them. The ecosystem of plug-ins would be layer 3 (note that this only works if you provide a common place to DISTRIBUTE the plug-ins and you make an effort to filter out malware). Finally, layer 4 would be the ability to build one's own plug-ins, but this layer would only be available to developers.<p>I have some software (like browsers, IDEs, and even older things like Emacs) that works like this today... but maybe all software should be built with layers of configurability.",1363621218

For example, GNU Smalltalk is the only other Smalltalk I know that has a decent command-line interface, but it lacks a JIT.  (If I have this wrong, hopefully Paolo will correct me.)  You can absolutely use Squeak to write real-world applications, but the last I checked, you still had to either use the older, slower FFI or write a plugin if you wanted to call C, and the official distributions still do not include a JIT.  Cuis is largely a subset of Squeak, and therefore has similar features and drawbacks, and so on and so forth.<p>If you go closed-source, you do have more options.  VisualWorks has a good C FFI and a fast JIT, and might have a great command-line interface (I honestly don't remember), but it's not even free-as-in-beer for hobby projects anymore.  Dolphin is likewise fast and has great COM bindings and good libraries, but is proprietary, and has disappeared and come back enough I'm not entirely sure I'd feel comfortable spending money on it.<p>So, yes, you're right, there are other Smalltalks that fulfill some of these requirements, but Pharo is, as far as I know, the only open-source one that fulfills all.",1363620523

I'm not saying that women generally employ less critical thinking skills (hence my original comment about astrophysics in that context), but at the same time there is very clearly something wrong that makes women more susceptible to this C/AM bullshit. There are clearly antibodies missing here, the question then becomes why are we giving those antibodies to men and denying them to women?<p>> <i>I think it's just because some things are more popular with women, and some with men.</i><p>Sure, though as I said in other comments, by default I tend to attribute these things overwhelmingly to culture, not physiology. Being susceptible to C/AM and other crap is not a cute little boy-girl difference, however. It's a massive problem, because having a mind with this faith-based nonsense in it is clearly a disadvantage that precludes victims from actually understanding the world. Not to mention it's a risk whenever ""alternative medicine"" is favored over actual treatment in critical situations.<p>> <i>Alternative medicine appears to me to be something that is more popular with women, and it also happens to be irrational.</i><p>My point is, that needs to change. It's not an innocent phenomenon. There is something deeply wrong here. To shift the focus a little, do you know which group is also extremely susceptible to non-scientific bullshit? Medical doctors.

These will have been studied by scientific methods exhaustively.  The next most common chunk will have received some cursory attention, and then you enter into the vast fields of the unknown.<p>But the fields aren't unknown to just science: they're unknown to cultural practitioners as well.  I'm willing to believe that, even without double-blind clinical trials, people were able to find effective treatments with enough trial and error.  But ""enough trial and error"" means ""not the long tail"".  So once you start talking the 1000th most common plant used for medicinal properties, the amount of experience pre-scientific practitioners have accumulated is negligible, and handful of anecdotes at best.  Not even enough to ascribe correlation, let alone causation.<p>So on the head of plants of potential value, I'm betting that they've all been studied exhaustively.  On the tail, there are countless plants which could have countless benefits, but essentially no evidence to do anything but pick one at random and hope it cures what ails you.

A few years ago I started working on a project to build a mobile based MMO, basically letting people play cops and robbers using GPS enabled devices but with character dev, leveling and questing like you'd find in something like WoW. I was the plot and (amateur) UX guy, and I teamed up with a group of coders to build a beta in return for equity.  We had a great concept and a good sized group of people who were really excited about seeing the product launch and playing the game.  The coding company I teamed up with required $ to code, however, and after a kickstarter campaign that didn't make it, we parted ways.  I'm really disappointed that I wasn't able to deliver the product to the people that wanted to use it. So here's where I am now.<p>If I had known how to program myself, I wouldn't have had to rely on a team to build the product.  I've come to the conclusion that if I really want to innovate in this field I'd better damn well know how to code.  I'd like your opinions on the best preparation for someone who wants to build front and back end in mobile.  I am considering doing a CS post bacc BS degree, but I know there are other ways to learn as well.  My background and education are in marketing and international relations, so this will be new territory for me, but I'm excited to dive in.  Anyway, what do you guys think?

5394629,comment,5393371,5394460,7,0,waps,,,"Actually, anyone that knows how turning off a large load unevenly and turning a large load back on affects the electricity grid knows perfectly well that doing that necessitates increasing energy production.<p>The short explanation is that large simultaneous changes in the electricity grid will create shocks which make it difficult to maintain the voltage at every point of the grid. Changing electricity distribution is not actually that fast country-wide, so the electricity company must put the largest possible load into the grid. When it is randomly reducing that is the load that was on the grid before the reduction, when the load is increasing that is a certain percentage above the point it's increasing to, generally ~20% more. Get it wrong and large amounts of electrical equipment will be confronted with a way too low, or way too high voltage on the sockets. Low is bad (stuff doesn't start, washers get ""stuck"", ...), equipment gets damaged because it can't be kept operating, which may cause fast on-off cycles that destroy electrical motors pretty quickly. Too high is VERY bad, for obvious reasons. The way to compensate for that is to put more energy in the grid so that every distribution box is capable of getting the local lines up to 240V, and destroy the excess at local distribution stations. If the load is very predictable that energy destruction can be kept to very low values, if it's not, you have to raise them.<p>So to make the farce of earth hour complete, electricity companies prepare for earth hour in Australia (earth hour's home turf) by ... increasing the output of local coal power plants, the worst offender for global warming ... Granted, the difference is probably small, but earth hour is definitely making things worse, not better.<p>You just can't make this up. Earth hour is a publicity stunt, meant to channel money and attention into it's parent publication, nothing more. It should be treated like any other pop-up ad.",1363619385

I'm Australian and we score an improved 19th on that league table. However I recently had the opportunity to study/work in a hospital in the states and these are some of my observations.<p>- The US healthcare system is fucked.<p>- there is a major disparity of care by region and neighbourhood (from my experience)<p>- poor people are discriminated against by the healthcare system<p>- these inequalities of care and resources are perpetuated down the line by a social system which doesn't support the most needy n society<p>In comparison, 
Cuba has one of the highest rates of doctors per capita and a healthcare system that performs astoundingly well, especially when compared on a dollar basis. You don't need high tech to perform life saving basic medical treatment, such as that which infant mortality measures.<p>I feel that the US healthcare system over-emphasises technology to deliver solutions, when what is actually needed are people on the ground in places where they are needed. Unfortunately for those people, they are unable to pay so no-one is going to go to them.<p>Now to the meat and potatoes of your claim. Firstly let me say that it strikes me as a bit aggressive. I said * in the same way as taking a drug that has been through a RCT does.*<p>If I am to respond to your whole query, then really I am throwing open the whole of medicine. And it's a big area. Everything from the correct techniques for birthing to height projection charts for children, through immunisations and treatment for common illnesses, to whole specialties of cardiology, renal medicine, .... Many many more.<p>But let me give you some anecdotes to show you how much of medicine HAS been studied. Maybe You will cry 'liar, deceiver!'. Or maybe I will be able to convey to you a bit of the never-ending torrent of information every doctor is swimming in (and I will admit, there are some that simply stop looking at it all).<p>Firstly. We have to do assignments called PEARLS. basically, w come across a clinical question and go and try and find evidence for it. As (at the time) a 3rd year med student, I still didn't really have much idea what was going on in the hospital, let alone how to formulate a clinical question and find an answer.<p>My question involved an elderly patient who had been transferred to the service I was on. He was on an ace inhibitor and an Angiotensin-receptor blocker. That is, 2 types of drugs which supposedly do the same thing.<p>This was a bit weird to me but it turned out there is some plausible science behind it - combination treatment might lead to being able to use lower doses, which can mean less side effects, as well as more effective RAAS blockade which might lead to better control of blood pressure.<p>Well it turned out that for this question I thought was stupid and pointless there had been a recently completed RCT, The ONTARGET Study, which proved that dual blockade is worse than single drug use.<p>My housemate is currently doing his, and his clinical question is whether an infected abdominal surgical wound should be closed or left open.
Also seems like a Bizzare question but turns out there are several papers on this, and they say that the wound must be left open.<p>No RCT this time, but it is notoriously hard to do RCTs in surgical patients for reasons I'm sure you can understand.<p>A thir anecdote: when we start med, they tell us that 50% of what we learn will be obsolete at the end of 4 years of study, the problem is we don't know which 50%. Such is the rate of scientific advancement.<p>When I first heard this I just thought it was an embellishment, a story designed to boast of the speed of discovery.
Turns out its true. Some significant changes have occurred since I've started studying that have overturned long-held practices.<p>An example would be the use of lidocaine and adrenaline/epinephrine in local anaesthetic for closing a wound in the extremity.<p>It was thought that the adrenaline would cause vasoconstriction which would lead to infarction and possible loss of a finger or toe if used. Recently a RCT was performed which showed it to be totally safe. That Overturned a practice that had been going for many many years.<p>The truth is, I can't give you a figure for the amount of evidence that has an RCT done for it. This is not shirking from the responsibility, but it is simply admitting that the scope of the practice of medicine is so unimaginably vast that even after spending 4 years deep in the thick of it, I know I will only ever be able to be proficient in a tiny area of the whole.<p>I can assure you, however, that people are working hard to ensure that everything will be studied. I would estimate that 99%+ of our practice has been published in some form, ranging from the worst - simple case reports, through to the most expensive and rarest- RCTs.
 We even study how reliable the examination signs are - by this I mean the percussion of fingers on your chest to detect various conditions (dullness indicating pneumonia has a likelihood ratio of 3, hyper resonance indicating COPD has a positive LR of 5.1) and every other thing that we do.<p>Some of these studies are bad; some are outdated; and sometimes we do things for years because they became habitual and weren't re-examined for a long time. And sometimes these things cause harm to patients.<p>But you can bet that it is the aim of medicine, and of science, to test and re-test all of the things we do, continually, with the aim of improving our practice and providing better and safer care.<p>The same can't be said of alternative medicine",1363619167

Experts with all the right credentials once told women to smoke. It's a great way to lose weight. Margarine was once good for you. In 2006, the <i>worst time to buy a house in 100 years</i>, the President of the United States stood up on stage and encouraged more people to buy homes. People are sick of it, and they're not listening anymore.<p>It doesn't matter if you're right or wrong. The only way to get peoples' attention now is to speak to them like equals and explain yourself. Opaque statements that appeal to authority tend to be tossed in the waste basket by most educated, thinking people. The only people who are willing to ""just believe"" anymore are fanatics, and they tend to be followers of the most idiotic bullshit imaginable.",1363619033

5394566,comment,5393019,5393885,1,0,dfox,,,"It depends on whether you consider attaching JTAG ICD and just reading whole state of CPU out an security attack. In some aspects just attaching an ICD to desktop CPU is simpler than attacks on physical security that involve freezing DRAM chips and reading their contents with patched BIOS or whatever. On the other hand it mostly requires attacker to have JTAG ICD that supports that particular CPU. Almost all x86 chips have some kind of ICD interface, usually very low-level and complete one. But because of low level nature of registers you see through it, JTAG register maps and so on are NDA-only and thus ICDs that support non-embedded CPUs tend to be very rare and in the realm of ""you can't afford it if you have to ask the price"". But they exist and buying one is more about the price than about any questions of the kind ""why do you need that?"". But because of rarity of these things most current research simply ignores this attack vector.<p>Bottom line: there is no such thing like security against local attacks on almost any kind of commodity hardware (including TPMs, excluding devices explicitly designed to be reasonably secure like gaming consoles). When you need that you also need proper tamper-proof hardware.",1363618814

The result would be that their complex civilizations crashed.<p>I think we have more important stuff to invest our intellects in than space exploration. All our current technology depends almost exclusively on cheap energy derived from fossil fuels. Human actions are damaging the complex processes that maintain live.<p>If we don't fix this problems I still think hedonistic technology is a better investment than space exploration.

A lot of thought, time and effort goes into the design of recognizable brands and widely used things. Just because they are designed by behemoths does not necessarily mean that they don't know what they are doing. On the contrary I would think they have put a lot of thought into it and the designs work quite well given the constraints.<p>So if you are going to challenge it, please have something substantial that operates in the constraints that apply to the product, not just something that looks pretty.<p></rant>",1269799072

I'm probably not the smartest person on HN, I might very well be among the dumber ones? How would I really determine that? I have no good answer to that. But <i>I am</i> smart.

It's easy to become blinded by flashy results. But remeber the tests you had to take in school. There were always two approached.
1) Study a lot, fill your brain with all the details before the test.
2) Just understand whatever it is you're doing.<p>Method #1 is hard, you have to focus, and you won't really learn anything either, al you will learn is how to repeat something you've heard before. It's likely that you'll forget what the test said you had supposedly ""learned"" within a year.

I already miss Baltimore. I new nothing about it, besides being familiar with the stereotypes, before moving there (spouse got into Hopkins, so Baltimore was part of the package deal), and I fell in love with it. I was sad to move away. Maryland in general was beautiful. But Baltimore, beyond the affordable cost of living, being on the water, and the bonus of living near D.C. and NYC, well, Baltimore is a rad, raucous, beautiful, sad, historic, electric, harsh, real fucking American city. I was there, and participated in, the uprising (as well as the <i>months</i> of <i>peaceful</i> protests leading up to that time that received <i>zero</i> national press), and have never experienced such a beautiful and powerful response to such a horrible challenge in any of the other cities I have lived.

Lately phone enhancements have been things like 0.2 ghz faster processor, larger screen, fingerprint reader. Reminds me a lot when HDTVs were offering higher refresh rates, gimmicks like 3D TV. Consumers decided they were not going to scrap their $2000 TV for another $2000 TV. Now those $2000 TVs are < $500.<p>So are consumers going to keep shelling out $600+ for a new phone every year or 2? Now in the USA they are more exposed to the price of the phone due to the elimination of contracts with phone subsidies.

11041332,comment,11036195,11040589,0,0,kls,,,"At the time NeXT was not in great shape either, IIRC they where contemplating killing their hardware in favor of just providing an alternative OS and where starting to pitch their visual IDE in the market. The consensus at the time is that NeXT would not have made it if not for the acquisition. They where not bankrupt by any means but what little market share they had gained had started to erode.<p>Slightly before this time, at the dawn of the web I had a NeXT box and they where great machines, but they where expensive and outside of early web dev and some scientific stuff they where not heavily used. Sun was eating at their scientific market with the Sun Stations and web dev kind of took off on every platform so the price point became less and less justifiable. My personal opinion is that NeXT would not have survived had Apple not come knocking at their door and would have suffered the same fate as BeOS, though jobs had the resources to drag it out far longer that Be did. It was not his success at NeXT that brought Apple back to the table with hat in hand, but rather it was his success with Pixar.<p>It was a time of consolidation, The Amiga had died, Atari was long out of the game and the Mac OS was aging rapidly hardware was fixed the only two options on the table where PC and Mac everything else had fallen by the wayside and the Mac&#x27;s operating system was on life support. Copeland had died which was supposed to be the savior OS and as such the Mac, while holding it&#x27;s own in pure hardware specs given the move to the PPC was not capitalizing on modern hardware or computing due to the OS. Meanwhile the hardware game was set so Steve was having no luck breaking into the market with his own hardware platform. Apple and NeXT needed each other and Apple needed Steve so it was a do or die for both. Apple was on the ropes pretty bad, there stock was $11 a share (god it sucked to be a broke college kid) and Gates shortly after this point would bail them out with a loan to stave off anti-trust allegations for another decade. Had the NeXT / Apple merger not happened both companies would not exist today. Kind of funny to think how close one of the largest companies of the times, almost blinked out of existence.",1454680307

For companies that are so heavily invested in connected white goods and home automation, selling a smartphone that can control a home hub at cost is akin to giving away a free remote control for a TV.

I wanted all results initially returned from a page to be dropped if they were older than a certain date; Thus I wanted Scrapy to keep scraping until no new items were found. Also, I wanted the latest date of the items returned so I could use this the next time I scrape.<p>The easies way is to raise CloseSpider exception in a callback if no new items are scraped - see <a href=""http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/topics/exceptions.html#closespider"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/topics/exceptions.html#closespi...</a><p>> I could never figure out what the difference between input and output processors where, or when I should use one or the other.<p>> The MapCompose function flattens object by default, So I had to be careful sometimes when returning lists that represented structure I wanted to retain.<p>I also have troubles understanding ItemLoader details. They are totally optional though, and they are no longer in Scrapy tutorial (<a href=""http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html</a>). Item loaders provide features very similar to <a href=""https://github.com/Suor/funcy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Suor/funcy</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/kachayev/fn.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kachayev/fn.py</a>.<p>> The way the html match object worked was sometimes confusing; If I wanted to match multiple items, then match items within each of those, I wanted a list of lists (group matches together base based on what matches they were found in). I can&#x27;t remember the details of why I found this hard, but I can try to come up with an example if you like?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what problems did you have. Scrapy selectors library (<a href=""https://github.com/scrapy/parsel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scrapy/parsel</a>) is quite similar to PyQuery (esp. when CSS selectors are used), and nothing prevents you from using PyQuery with Scrapy. In future we may add PyQuery (and BeautifulSoup?) support to parsel and provide PyQuery selectors as response.pq (like response.css and response.xpath), +1 to do that.<p>> In the end I figured I was having to learn the structure of Scrapy for everything that I wanted it to do, but many of Scrapy&#x27;s features I didn&#x27;t need e.g. I didn&#x27;t want command-line control (I would actually prefer not to use the interface, though didn&#x27;t discover how I could write a python script to apply the spider directly).<p>Yeah, library interface used to be a problem. It was improved in 1.0 release (there is an official API for integrating Scrapy with Twisted apps and running spiders from user scripts), but there is still more to go. See <a href=""http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/topics/practices.html#run-scrapy-from-a-script"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/topics/practices.html#run-scrap...</a>.<p>It probably won&#x27;t be as easy to integrate with regular Python scripts as mechanize because Scrapy is async. On the other hand, Scrapy is easier to integrate with async servers like Twisted or Tornado.<p>> Now I prefer to use mechanize + PyQuery; PyQuery is at least as good as processing web pages as Scrapy&#x27;s object, and if I need something more for opening a page e.g. complicated login, I can use mechanize. I find this a more modular approach, and think that I better understand what&#x27;s going on in my scripts.<p>You may want to check the new &#x27;Scrapy at glance&#x27; page (<a href=""http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html</a>). The main advantage of Scrapy over mechanize is that it handles parallel downloads and have a wide range of built-in extensions you won&#x27;t have to implement yourselves.",1454679232

Java GUI apps also tend to use too much resources, feel laggy and look bad & non-native, jEdit is not an exception.<p>This is a funny myth.<p>Now to some facts:<p>1. It’s the Applet part that has a bad security record. Not standalone Applications.<p>2. Java GUI apps use less resources, are less laggy, and more native than any node.JS app out there. jEdit is not an exception.<p>It’s crazy to see people hype Atom for being node-webkit, extensible, etc, but complain about Java apps for &quot;bundles a whole runtime&quot; (while node-webkit bundles a whole browser), for &quot;so slow and laggy&quot; (but faster than node-webkit), for &quot;looks not native&quot; (but more than node-webkit)",1454678866

I wanted all results initially returned from a page to be dropped if they were older than a certain date; Thus I wanted Scrapy to keep scraping until no new items were found. Also, I wanted the latest date of the items returned so I could use this the next time I scrape.<p>I created the &#x27;DropElderMiddleware&#x27; middleware to do this. I couldn&#x27;t see any other way of making calculations based on items returned from a particular page.<p>I could never figure out what the difference between input and output processors where, or when I should use one or the other.<p>The MapCompose function flattens object by default, So I had to be careful sometimes when returning lists that represented structure I wanted to retain.<p>The way the html match object worked was sometimes confusing; If I wanted to match multiple items, then match items within each of those, I wanted a list of lists (group matches together base based on what matches they were found in). I can&#x27;t remember the details of why I found this hard, but I can try to come up with an example if you like?<p>In the end I figured I was having to learn the structure of Scrapy for everything that I wanted it to do, but many of Scrapy&#x27;s features I didn&#x27;t need e.g. I didn&#x27;t want command-line control (I would actually prefer not to use the interface, though didn&#x27;t discover how I could write a python script to apply the spider directly).<p>Now I prefer to use mechanize + PyQuery; PyQuery is at least as good as processing web pages as Scrapy&#x27;s object, and if I need something more for opening a page e.g. complicated login, I can use mechanize.

The case was dropped because the standard for criminal law is &quot;beyond all reasonable doubt&quot;, at least in any rational or sane justice system.<p>There is absolutely no way a case with this many holes in will ever - EVER - reach that standard of evidence unless they have something really unusual, like video evidence of what happened.<p>The chance of getting a conviction in this case given the weaknesses of the claims, the he said/she said nature, and the contradictory behaviour of the alleged victims afterwards (which included attempting to remove evidence that contradicted their story by deleting tweets etc), all point towards a failed prosecution.

It's not the case that people in the DoJ or the WH wake up one morning and decide they can't be bothered with the courts any more. The law is <i>designed</i> to cut the Judicial branch out of the loop.<p>1. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5383670"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5383670</a>",1363391873
5383733,comment,5375648,5375648,2,0,mapt,,,"This is literally among the dumbest environmentalist ideas out there.  It's a <i>tragedy</i> it gets so much attention because that enthusiasm could be oriented towards advocacy of things which <i>actually make a difference</i>.<p>A napkin calculation a while back factoring in the cost of farmland, light, land, and skyscraper construction showed approximately a <i>60,000x cost difference</i> per pound of crops between purpose-build skyscraper-type vertical farming startup costs, and prime Iowa farmland.  I'm not exaggerating.<p>Compare irrigated desert land under intensive greenhouse cultivation with skyscrapers, and you're <i>still</i> at hundreds or thousands of times more expensive.<p>The most sizable vertical farm at present is either a natural-light ""bookshelf style"" setup in Singapore which does absolutely nothing for land use by shading other land, and grows a trivial amount of crops, or a artificially-lit 30x30m area on Chiba University operated purely for research purposes, which sells its products on the side.<p>When someone says ""X is planned for Chicago"", that actually means something to some of us, something other than ""An undergrad design student asked for creative solutions to save the world came up with a pretty render that any architect, engineer, farmer, or businessman would laugh at on close examination"".  I would ask the green energy sites to stop lying to our faces on this topic, necessitating stories like this [1].<p>The only way this kind of solution is remotely feasible is when your product is marijuana, and it costs $1000/lb.  Expensive niche herbs like basil and wasabi may be able to grow economically in a climate controlled hydroponic system... but they can only pay warehouse rent if that, not skyscraper rent.<p>We owe the promotion of this concept to Dickson Despommier [2], a tenured professor of public health / environmental health sciences at Columbia University in Manhattan.  Take one of the two most geographically and economically scarce land markets in the country, and apply ""locavore"" principles, and this stupidity is what you get.<p>To the people believing because a render was created and it was ""planned"" that this means they can absolve their share of environmental white guilt for living in a neighborhood without any trees or permeable surfaces... Stop promoting this, please.  Tens of square miles of city displaces thousands of square miles of suburb, and you're living at 1/10th the resource intensity of the rest of the country by not driving everywhere.  Farmland is not this scarce, and transportation for food is not this expensive.<p>The breathless enthusiasm of the green bloggers which are paid per post and have no formal science training past middle school has brought this concept to the forefront again and again. I've been shouting at my computer for nigh on ten years now and it <i>will not die</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/james-blog/1810325/so-las-vegas-getting-vertical-farm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/james-blog/1810325/so-las-ve...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.verticalfarm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.verticalfarm.com/</a>",1363391859

I did start by acknowledging joelthelion's point, and I have no problem with the idea that someone who has a genuine business need to do something outside the normal rules should be able to request a reasonable exception to whatever general policies might apply.<p>However, you need an awful lot of indirect benefit to make up for one screw-up that breaches corporate security, particularly if you work in a regulated industry like healthcare or finance. Lawyers and industry regulators don't care about any goodwill you got from letting Bob bring his own laptop to work if Bob's laptop was subsequently left on a train opening access to thousands of customers' medical records or credit card details. You could probably have fired Bob and hired an entire team of other people who didn't care about using their own laptop with the money you're instead paying as a fine for that one, though perhaps not so much if the business collapses due to the adverse PR and an executive or two gets thrown in jail for negligence.",1363391826

Congress frequently produces laws that attempt to mandate the behavior of the Executive branch* while excluding that behavior from judicial review (which courts do not take kindly to and frequently dismiss).<p>A lot of legislators do not like the Judicial branch and consider it to be an annoying restraint on their lawmaking power; what looks like tension between the Executive and Judicial branches is often as not a proxy for Legislative claims. Whenever you see a piece of legislation with phraseology like '[officer of some executive branch agency] shall do x, y, z, in the following fashion...' pay attention to the word <i>shall</i>. In law this is understood to make the action mandatory, and where the law is very specific on procedures and actions it's basically an attempt to micromanage the operation of the agency in question.<p>Consider the following imaginary law:<p><i>If any person wears white after Labor Day, the head of the Fashion Police shall cause that person to be arrested and fined $1,000. This procedure shall not be subject to judicial review.</i><p>Now if you're the Fashionista-general, you have <i>no choice</i> but to arrest people wearing white after Labor Day [for non-Americans, wearing white after late September is jokingly regarded as an offense against good taste]. Failure to do so clearly violates the oath of office required of office-holders in the Executive branch. And the same law says that you don't get to complain about this in court, so judges are supposed to dismiss your case without even giving it a hearing.

Let's start tomorrow?""
Them: ""Yeah -- wait, I have to meet a friend for dinner tomorrow.  Can you do the day after?""
Me: ""Sure.""<p>[two days later]<p>Me: ""Hey, we're still meeting up tonight, right?""
Them: ""Crap, I have to work late.  Let's meet on Saturday and just bang out some work all afternoon.""<p>We're fucked.  We're fucked before we've even started.  If every ""dinner with a friend"" or ""I have to work late"" is going to sideline you, then how the hell are you supposed to <i>do</i> anything?  Even if we do work for six hours on Saturday instead of three two-hour sessions during the week, it's just not the same.  We'll have no cadence or rhythm and feel stressed and probably a lot like the people in the OP's study.<p>A few years ago I recognized this anti-pattern and so I don't really take on new projects or goals unless I'm literally willing to prioritize everything but the bare essentials (ie. family) above it.  PG's ""Top of Your Mind"" describes what 'mental prioritization' looks like, and I think this study points describes what 'schedule prioritization' looks like.<p>I realize that my own conclusions are my projections completely based on own anecdotes, and I'm sure many people on HN won't hesitate to point out the logical fallacies for why that's dumb.  But look back in your life and think about the times you've consistently said, ""Sorry, I can't make it, I have to do X first.""  Did you eventually reach a level of achievement with X?

What sorts of dependencies do you have between the things you want to run?  Will it run in the main event loop, separate thread, separate process, or on a separate host?

HPC job schedulers take care of things like resource management (run this job on this machine because it has the lowest load) and dependency management (don't run job b until job a completes), whereas cron handles running periodic tasks and that's about it.

8223449,comment,8222017,8223109,1,0,scoofy,,,"Here, again, i disagree with the weight of your intended counter-factual. Your issues with equality and identity (formally: the frege-russell distinction) i simply disagree with. Your issue here is not equality and identity, but identity and subsumption.<p>Equality and identity are essentially the same with being verbs. Your sentence is an error of clarity, you&#x27;d fool a human in the same way as you&#x27;d fool a computer. I believe the ambiguity you are going for is that of &quot;123 Main St is McDonalds&quot; (identity) vs &quot;123 Main St is a McDonalds&quot; (subsumption, also called class-inclusion). Here however, we have the &quot;a&quot; which clarifies that the statement means subsumption. Why? because it would fool humans otherwise, and so we created a rule for clarification.<p>I certainly think a natural language programming language would need to ask clarity questions via a parser before running a program, but i honestly don&#x27;t think this is a serious problem.<p>It would really only be a problem with intentionally ambiguous words and phrases, such as the verb &quot;to hook up&quot; which is intentionally fuzzy enough to allow the speaker to mean one thing, while allowing the speaker to imply something else.",1408993168

Industry candidates come through a different pipeline.<p>* We have people dedicated to logistics: scheduling the loops with engineers, air transit, hotel, rental cars, etc.\n* A separate group of dedicated people handles the candidate&#x27;s side: Email them details ahead of time, meet them at the beginning and end of the day, and keep them informed throughout the process.\n* Although we have an official tool for documenting interview loops, the more important aspect is a strong culture of &quot;warm handoffs&quot; from interviewer to interviewer. What was covered, where did the candidate do well, where could we use a deeper dive to understand the candidate&#x27;s skills?\n* Training at multiple levels for interviewers: Before you can begin interviewing, you have to attend a training. Many divisions have historically required additional training. Want to go to campus? There&#x27;s another training for that. Also, the training now emphasizes how useless &quot;trick&quot; questions are and how to formulate good questions.<p>There&#x27;s more, but it veers into proprietary details of the process that I don&#x27;t feel comfortable disclosing.",1408992962

The Verge ran a piece about it back in May 2013.<p>> The law seems to include an exemption for hosts who rent out an extra room or couch to a &quot;lawful boarder&quot; for less than 30 days, but remain in the dwelling while the guest is there. Because Warren&#x27;s roommate was home while his Russian boarder was there, he argued that the exemption should apply. However, the judge interpreted the terms &quot;boarders and lodgers&quot; in the law to mean &quot;occupants who share the life of the dwelling with its permanent occupants&quot; and not to &quot;complete strangers who have no, and are not intended to have any, relationship with the permanent occupant.&quot; Because the Russian visitor did not interact with Warren or his roommate, the judge said, the exemption should not apply.<p>That last sentence is an interesting interpretation of the judge&#x27;s decision, but the rest of it is pretty spot on.

8223337,comment,8219506,8220210,2,0,Joeri,,,"In my opinion the trick to large-scale software architecture is to build small software systems tied together by strictly defined interfaces. There are many ways to ensure the strictness of the interface: having strict typing and a compilation step, unit tests, static code validation (compiling without compiling), and even hungarian notation and systematic code reviews. Those are not mutually exclusive tools; quality improves with each one added, but none are mandatory.<p>My personal experience working on large systems without unit tests (among others a 200.000 line javascript codebase) is that as long as you adopt good coding practices around how you define clearly typed interfaces the lack of unit tests doesn&#x27;t hurt you that badly and there is no wild-growth of bugs. Using the jetbrains IDE&#x27;s also made a big difference for me due to the static code checking. I want to see the little code quality box at the top of the scrollbar turn green, and the process of doing that tends to weed out a lot of those bugs that a unit test or a strict type system would catch.<p>I do think that if you&#x27;re building large-scale or long-lived systems, it is not any faster to use a dynamically typed language. I&#x27;ve written lots of code in both strictly typed and loosely typed languages, and I find that while I enjoy a loosely typed language more, I am equally productive in the strictly typed environment because strict typing makes it easier to write reliable code from the outset.",1408992371

First, you should absolutely edit this to change the name and gender pronouns, you are clearly misgendering this person<p>I feel that&#x27;s white-washing the record, when I think my intent was clear and honest.  I was asking for how to deal with this, not stating a preference.  Instead I&#x27;ll apologize here with a clarification of intent (as I&#x27;ve done elsewhere).  If I had known the correct way to refer to Chelsea Manning in the past tense, I would have done so.  Since I didn&#x27;t, I used the method I thought made the most sense, with explanation.<p>> However, it is rare to need to phrase something this way and usually such phrasings serve to portray being trans in a negative light.<p>How does it portray them in a negative light?  Is Muhammad Ali portrayed in a negative light when he&#x27;s referred to as Cassius Clay in the past?  In what ways is that different?  Is it different just because of the current state of social acceptance of transgender people?  Does that imply that at some point in the future it won&#x27;t be different?  Does that strengthen the scheme of the status quo, or is it an argument towards a more normalized usage in past tense?<p>> It is not confusing whatsoever. People change names and aliases all the time for a variety of reasons but the world doesn&#x27;t end and future generations aren&#x27;t confused as to who someone is.<p>Well, obviously people <i>are</i> confused, because <i>I</i> just was when I first read the headline of this article, meaning there&#x27;s at least one person in the world that&#x27;s been confused by this.  Do we need to argue this, or can we move on to something more useful, like trying to figure how many people are confused, how often, how likely they are to fix the confusion, if it&#x27;s more or less confusing than other schemes, and other pros and cons?<p>> Moreover, misgendering someone isn&#x27;t just ignoring their identity, it is a slap in the face and challenges the validity of their existence.<p>The issue here is, I think, that you label referring to someone in the past tense <i>as they were</i> in the past tense as misgendering, while I&#x27;m not sure I accept that.  I think people can be expected to and have a right to control their current state, I&#x27;m not so sure I would extend that to them being able to change their past state.",1408991138

By asking it up front, I&#x27;m taking some pressure of the candidate by taking 5-10 minutes to present information to them before I put them on the spot. Candidates are generally nervous and/or trying to quickly figure out the situation, and this gives them some warm up time as they learn more about their interviewer, the team, the product, the company, etc. Helps set the tone of a dialog rather than a grilling. Then I ask again at the end just to make sure they feel like they have enough information to make a decision. Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t work for Google / perhaps some companies have a set interview format where this wouldn&#x27;t work. I recall an interview I did at one name-brand tech company where the interviews were scheduled for 40 minutes, so there was no time for any kind of chit-chat.",1408991100

I own some handguns, have had a CCW in the past, and I wouldn&#x27;t carry on an airplane. I&#x27;m not opposed to it, I just don&#x27;t see a reason to do so. Same as I don&#x27;t see a reason to carry in my eastside Seattle suburb neighborhood when walking the dogs: it&#x27;s probably the smallest risk I&#x27;ll face all day.

The singular time I have ever even considered drawing a handgun for defense, there were people in the area behind the potential target, with a non-zero chance of hitting them were I to miss. Too risky, found another way to resolve the issue. On an airplane? The background behind the target is almost guaranteed to have innocents. I <i>might</i> trust combat-experienced military personnel to take the shot, no way would I trust someone who has only put holes in paper at a shooting range with no adrenaline coursing through their veins (a group which would include myself).",1408990589

Even the best natural language processing algorithms can only really come up with a probability of the intent of the sentence; this is often not enough for a programming language (which by necessity requires precision to be repeatable).<p>Nouns themselves can take a number of different meanings (specifically proper nouns and names) depending on context. Communicative languages often don&#x27;t distinguish between equality and identity; a critical distinction in computer science (i.e. I can truthfully say &quot;I&#x27;ve eaten at same restaurant 3 days in a row&quot; if I ate at 3 different McDonalds locations on consecutive days). These assumptions about identity and equality are not the same from language to language (or even generation to generation, as you discussed). Context is also an issue; we often discuss things in ambiguous contexts which often require clarifying questions from a human. We may have effective communication between humans, but misunderstandings are common. IMO, language is an effective communication tool almost specifically because it is imprecise: we fill in the gaps with our own experiences and it mostly works out.<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t think EWD was saying that natural language programming would be impossible; just that the effort required to program in it would likely be more than learning a symbolic programming language. The computer would need to ask so many clarifying questions to reach the level of specificity required for computer science that it would be a very arduous task. Rather than making computer programming more accessible, natural language programming would make it substantially more difficult.",1408990445

The height difference between these two beams will be about 1 micron. If we assume that the beams are large enough that there is no spread in beam size, then each beam is about 3 cm in diameter. This means we need to measure the beam height to better 0.003% accuracy relative to the beam size. I think this will be a very difficult measurement.<p>I think there is a way you could very accurately measure the relative angle between two beams in a larger interferometer and two lasers, but I&#x27;ll have to think about how it would look...<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s always fun to think about this small corrections to our expectations. To be honest, I was a little surprised to think about it, 4cm of deviation over 700m is actually a bit larger than I expected.",1408990152

I&#x27;m not pushing an agenda, just trying to discuss something that I encountered.<p>> Your discomfort with trans folks<p>This is the projection I was referring to.  I thought I was pretty clear that I was uncomfortable with the historical record changing on someone&#x27;s future decision.  That this decision is common to transgender people is irrelevant to be points.  If you want to argue that gender and name are important enough to warrant the changes, that&#x27;s fine.  If you can&#x27;t make the argument without referring to transgender people, that <i>may</i> be a sign the argument needs refinement, or may have some baked in assumptions that don&#x27;t hold.  For example, I personally hold name and gender to be of equal importance.  Maybe that&#x27;s not the case for you, or any number of others.  That may be a bad assumption on either of our parts.<p>> There is a difference between talking about past events and continuing to insist on misgendering someone in the present.<p>And where was I saying we should misgender them in the present?  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s misgendering someone to refer to them as &quot;he&quot; when referring to them at some point when they referred to themselves with that pronoun, and as &quot;she&quot; in the present when that&#x27;s how they refer to themselves.

244114,comment,244009,244009,0,0,cch,,,"You should really ask an attorney about the cost/benefit of different options, but here are a few as I understand them, and why VCs generally demand a C corp structure.  Standard disclaimer--I don't know what I am talking about and you are an idiot to believe anything I say.<p>Tax is a big one, and the reason I think that VCs don't like LLCs.  LLCs are ""passthrough"" entities for tax purposes, like partnerships.  They don't pay taxes....the members (shareholders) of the LLC pay taxes on their portion of the LLCs earnings or losses.  For VCs and other institutional investors, this creates a nightmare from an accounting point of view.<p>C Corps are technically ""persons"" for tax purposes, and pay their own taxes.  Much simpler....VCs are not in business for tax credits, they want capital gains when the successful investment is sold.<p>Governance--C corps have existed for a long time and there is a considerable body of law around them.  Delaware is preferred because its laws are considered optimal (not sure of the details why), and its fees are low.<p>LLCs are very flexible...many of the governance elements are crafted into the Operating Agreement that controls the LLC, which is why LLC docs are much longer than the incorporation docs.  I have always found that LLCs are more expensive to set up because of this.<p>So.....if you are going to take outside institutional investment, save time and start with a C corp...might as well do Delaware since every lawyer speaks Delaware law.<p>If you are not taking professional money, then you may prefer the tax efficiency of the LLC.  You get tax benefits while you are losing money, and you eliminate one layer of income taxes when you are making money.  This is assuming you distribute the excess cash--if you don't, then you have to pay taxes anyway, but you don't have the cash to help.  For this reason, most LLCs make what is called a tax distribution to help members cover their tax liability.<p>There are other structures (sole proprietorship, S corp, partnership) that have pros and cons depending on exactly what your aspirations are for the business, but C corps and LLCs dominate.",1215817048

That's going to be hard.<p>There is no good short-term answer but here's the only way: asking in the right places (like here) and getting very lucky.

How would be in Apple's best interests to take on the massive overhead of being a CPU manufacturer?<p>I'm not even convinced that it would be in Apple's best interests to be in the graphics hardware business either, but at least that doesn't entail owning a fab. Neither nVidia nor ATI fabricated their own chips, they contracted that work out to foundries like Chartered and UMC. Owning a fabless graphics hardware developer might work out for Apple, but I'm a bit skeptical about that. I'm also not convinced that it was a wise purchase for AMD though.",1215816189

I regularly hire friends of friends, but then I hang out with very technical people who have very technical friends.  I've picked up a lot of really good technical people with little experience and paid 'em $15/hr to work for me... most of them leave for better pay after a year or so, but if I was compitent at business, I'd be able to pay them more by then.<p>My big problem is that if you are incompetent at something, you can't reconise compitence.  I am an incompitent business person, so I can't recognise a good sales/businessperson.    Even with a good solid technical team, you need business compitency to succeed, and there isn't much of that in my social circle, and even if there was, I wouldn't be able to tell the good from the pretenders.<p>It sounds like I need to get together with someone like you, but who?  I mean, I alrealdy said, I can't tell if someone is a compitent businessperson, and having the wrong CEO is much worse, imo, than having no CEO at all.",1215815643

244100,story,,,18,18,time_management,"Ask HN: Thoughts on grad school? (CS PhD)",,"To give a little bit of background about myself: Although I took some CS courses in college, I didn't seriously consider myself a programmer until just over a year ago, when I started writing code as a quant at a hedge fund and realized that, when using the right languages and working on cool problems, programming can be a lot of fun. I've also realized that there are many people a lot better at it than I am, so I have a lot to learn about technology and computers. Among my interests are artificial intelligence and programming languages, so I figure that graduate school might be the way to go.<p>I'm interested in AI/machine learning research, which practically require a PhD, even in industry. I've also considered the entrepreneurial route, but I lack a certain technical maturity as well as co-founders, both of which I could find in grad school. Eventually, when I'm in my 40s, I'd like to be involved in VC... but I'd like to spend the next couple decades doing more detailed technology work so that, when I get there, I understand what I'm analyzing.<p>So, given my interests and career aspirations, I'm considering pursuing a PhD in computer science. I'm wondering if anyone here could give me some perspective on what to expect.<p>Here are my credentials. I'd like to know what I can expect in terms of admissions success. Are, for example, top-10 departments a possibility?<p>3.9 / 4.0 in-major (math) from top liberal arts college.<p>CS courses: AI, PL, Software Eng., Data Structures, Intro. Grades of A/A- in all but SE.<p>GRE (2004): 800Q/670V, 98% on math subj. test, have not taken CS subj. test.<p>Top 100 finish on Putnam.<p>Research: Two internships in applied math, but in a govt. context. Consequently, I have no publications, so this may be a weakness.<p>Career: Entered pure-math grad program in fall 2005. Passed quals but did poorly in courses. Left after 1 year (no degree) to work on Wall Street, starting 5/2006. Worked on WS up to 2008, with a reasonably successful career and 1+ year of programming experience, but no research or publications (obviously).<p>Specific questions are:<p>1. How much is it going to hurt me that I entered a PhD program and left? Is this a deal-breaker, or can I explain it away? (My reason for leaving pure math is that I realized the academic job market sucked, and that I was already qualified for a decent industry job. However, a CS PhD carries a lot of benefits outside of academia.) Could I possibly turn my grad school experience into an asset, noting (in spite of my lack of success, and departure) that I've been through the experience before and know what I'm getting into?<p>2. Ideally, I'd like to get an NSF or equivalent fellowship, but I have no hope of getting that without research experience. Is it likely, outside of the ivory tower, that I can hook up with a mentor and get to work on a problem so that, when it becomes time (12/08-2/09) to apply to schools and for fellowships, I'm on the ball?<p>3. How much does the distinction between top (5, 10, 20) schools and the rest matter in CS, assuming that I will not be seeking academia? Do AI research groups care about the distinction between #1 and #8 and #22? If I pursue the entrepreneurial route, are higher-ranked schools going to have better co-founders?<p>4. The most important, but most distant question: What can I expect once I am in graduate school in computer science? What are the courses, students, research opportunities, and career possibilities like?",1215814896

244098,comment,243758,244090,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I should have said ""Real Numbers"" instead of ""Integers"", sorry.<p>My point is that sqrt(-1) = i is an extra assumption that you don't need to make in order to derive the math you do in school. If you don't make that assumption, you can still derive a lot of math. If you do make that assumption, then you can also derive the theorems of complex analysis.<p>I think that's true, anyway. I could be wrong.<p>It just seems strange to me that someone would be bothered by the lack of negative square roots, since their existence is never derived, only assumed. But then again, people's minds work very differently, especially in Mathematics.<p>I was the opposite in Math class. I fought accepting ""i"" when they tried to teach it to us since it seemed so arbitrary and contrived to me. This was before I discovered that all Math is arbitrary and that there is no ""real math"", anyway.",1215814675

IBM and AMD are sharing a lot of R&D costs, along with most of the major semiconductor manufacturer's out there (like Samsung, TSMC, UMC, Chartered Semi, etc). IBM and AMD are also trading technologies; IBM provided AMD with low-K semiconductor technology, and AMD provided IBM with automation technology for IBM's fabs.<p>And don't forget that IBM WAS in the desktop chip market. They even had an x86 license that allowed IBM to design x86 processors, as well as manufacture them.<p>They tried to get back into that market with the G5, and both AMD and Intel pretty much steamrolled it -- because IBM launched the G5 while AMD and Intel were hot on each others' heels (AMD lead performance at the time, Intel lead price).<p>IBM didn't make Apple happy because IBM couldn't afford to. Back then, IBM's semiconductor division was losing (each quarter) approximately AMD's annual operating budget.

MS and Sony have 2nd sources for Xenon and Cell (Chartered or UMC, I forget which, and Toshiba respectively), because IBM's not so good at making high-volume chips at reasonable cost.<p>Would it be worth for IBM?

This would seem to increase complexity, not decrease it.<p>It reduces the total number of endpoints that need to go through SSL.  That is a win complexity wise.  I do not need to hand over SSL keys to my CDN for instance.  I just put the file there and keep my checksum list on a server I actually do control the keys on.  As an example.  That <i>is</i> reducing complexity and makes it more secure in the process.  At the cost of people knowing which files are downloaded.",1430409570

Which one depends on whether the person stating it was faced with a similar decision and decided in the direction they advise. If I&#x27;ve evaluated the risks and decided that putting bars on my windows is wise, and I did it, then it&#x27;s totally reasonable for me to criticize people who didn&#x27;t and subsequently got their house broken into.

If there was potentially chemoluminescent fluid in the backplane (which would then have to be a gel/sponge), and the pins could pull it in via capillary action somehow—maybe the heads on the pins could be squeezed, making them effectively into little bulb syringes—then fluid could end up in the pinhead and react with something inside.",1430409250

It seems like many new languages are going with this route of tools supported by core-dev, such as package management.  For instance Go ships its code formatting tool, which seems like a good idea.  Supporting an IDE seems more questionable, for instance Python never seemed to have much success with IDLE, and IDE preference is very personal.  Anyway, as someone who primarily writes Python at work I find Nim to be very usable because the syntax and style is so familiar, and I really like most of the decisions they have made.

Put more clearly I don&#x27;t think any three people reading this would agree on what you mean by encryption in your post.<p>If you instead said &quot;protect&quot; &quot;everything&quot; / all traffic / all data/ all browsing /... , and gave some details as to the threats you are concerned about, it might strengthen the argument you are making.<p>EG : &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;names of sites I visit&quot; from sousveillance ... &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;integrity of software packages I download&quot; from &quot;evilgrade&quot; attacks ... protect &quot;the pseudo-anonymity&quot; of &quot;journalists posting to social networks&quot; from &quot;state sponsored malware injection&quot; ... and so on. Encryption techniques could be (are) used against all of these problems, but in different ways.<p>There is a lot to discuss and try to understand in these issues. Thank you for contributing positively to the discussion ( and I hope I am as well).",1430409070

That way:<p>* Loading common resources is fast - already loaded by other sites<p>* If resource isn&#x27;t cached, the browser doesn&#x27;t need to open a second connection to a CDN, it can grab the file from the same site<p>* Proliferation of multiple CDNs ceases to be an issue, as each does not have separate browser cache<p>* Evil CDNs cannot provide bad JS as integrity is checked and the site isn&#x27;t relying on a CDN anyway<p>* If a CDN goes down, your site isn&#x27;t broken, because the fallback can be to a local file<p>Would work something like this:<p><pre><code>  <script src=&quot;hash-lookup:jquery-1.10.2.min.js,sha256-C6CB9UYIS9UJeqinPHWTHVqh/E1uhG5Twh+Y5qFQmYg=,static/jquery-1.10.2.min.js&quot;></script>

Browser checks cache for a file with a matching name and hash, ignoring site (this looks in a special cache for files loaded with hash-lookup, you can&#x27;t check for arbitrary web resources). If there is one, it&#x27;s used. If not, it loads it from the fallback URL, checks the hash, and catches it.<p>Now, this would create potential for hash collision attacks.

America currently has more vacant homes than there are homeless people.  In fact, if we wanted, we could give six vacant homes to each homeless person, let them pick the one they like the best, and give back the other five.  It absolves the taxpayer obligation to maintain the homes (which isn&#x27;t really being met anyway), puts the homeless in homes, and doesn&#x27;t really have too much in the way of perverse incentives, but for the invariability that we might temporarily grow the homeless population for those looking for free homes.<p>I don&#x27;t know how that fixes wage slavery in any meaningful way though, as having a home doesn&#x27;t positively correlate to having a job.  The problem of poverty right now is lack of full time employment.  There&#x27;s not really any fix for wage slavery that is predicated on capitalism, if capitalism is to have any actual meaning, anyway.  I mean, there&#x27;s minimum wage, but while it&#x27;s easy to acknowledge that there&#x27;s no direct correlation between minimum wage and unemployment, OECD companies with the highest minimum wages tend to have the highest rates of unemployment.  Unemployment very positively correlates with poverty, house or not.<p>There&#x27;s an argument to be made that if housing were free, that the minimum wage could be abolished, but that doesn&#x27;t sound like something you&#x27;d support.",1430408215

That -- even outside of ecommerce -- there&#x27;s no way any icky ISP could be doing deep packet inspection to sell your data out for ads, or any virus on a cheap consumer-grade router interested in hijacking your profile to turn into a spambot? And assuming, moreover, that this New Technological Capability would be deployed in a consistent and timely fashion? Sure, I agree it&#x27;d be an excellent deterrent to many attacks on its own, but end-to-end encryption easily wins. (And if you&#x27;re really an interesting &quot;larger website&quot; then you have the resources to make SSL happen.)",1430407704
9465649,comment,9465078,9465078,0,0,jerf,,,"So, I&#x27;ve upvoted the article because these are things that need to be discussed. And I don&#x27;t have good answers necessarily, all I really have is a sort of counterpoint to add to the pile of confusing issues.<p>Consider the two-dimensional graph of difficulty of hostile interception of traffic vs. the value of hostile interception of traffic to the intercepting entity. (&quot;Interception&quot; including both attacking authenticity and privacy of the connection.) In the low/low side, you have, say, my blog posts. Deliberately public, of interest to pretty much nobody &quot;official&quot;, unencrypted, unauthenticated HTTP. On the high/high side, well-encrypted inter-colo traffic between two computers owned by a bank, or perhaps an arms manufacturer.<p>10 years ago, this was a rich graph with lots of interesting nuances. Who even cares about the easy/easy cases? Of course the hard/hard cases justify encryption. And there&#x27;s a lot of in between and useful cost/benefit analysis that could be done. I think the original article is written based on this mental conception of the landscape.<p>However, recently between technological advances and increased discovery about what is being done by governments (and remember, <i>not just</i> the US government, <i>many</i> have been caught doing things and many more are presumably getting away with things we still have not heard about) and a variety of corporations (and remember all this Superfish stuff and such <i>predates</i> the mandatory encryption!) has revealed that the previously-rich 2D landscape really isn&#x27;t 2D after. It turns out that there is no &quot;difficulty&quot; dimension. It&#x27;s all very easy to intercept, at scale, if not downright trivial. Governments hoover (both the vacuum and as in J. Edgar) up entire fiber optic trunks. Companies and spyware get a footprint on a machine and basically nuke all SSL flat for thousands of machines or entire major corporations at a time.<p>In the other dimension, it has become pretty clear that even &quot;trivial metadata&quot; allows far more information to be exposed about someone than any but a handful of computer scientists would have believed 10 years ago [1]. Everything has a great deal more value than we thought.<p>The net effect of all of this is that it collapses the entire previously-two-dimensional landscape to a nearly a single point. Everything is trivial to collect, and everything leaks a shocking amount of information, and information is power.<p>Consequently, regardless of the fact that both answers suck in their own way, we really only have one choice: Require encryption, or not. There&#x27;s no middle ground anymore. We used to have one, but it&#x27;s collapsed away.<p>And, frankly, acknowledging everything in the original article and with the amplification that there&#x27;s probably even some stuff missing that could be added, I&#x27;m pretty sure that in the end, there&#x27;s still only one reasonable choice, which is the direction we&#x27;re currently headed in. Yeah, it sucks. But a root cause analysis of the problem isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s the encryption&#x27;s fault... it&#x27;s the companies, spyware, and government that have put in so very, very much effort into collapsing this landscape. Blame <i>them</i> for the measures we have to take to protect everybody.<p>Though, even as you do so, bear in mind that in the rich, complex ecosystem of the Internet, parasites are ultimately inevitable, so it&#x27;s also no use pretending that if we just fix the current companies and governments we could somehow change the problems. The only answer is that, yeah, we have to rewrite how the &quot;laws of physics&quot; of this ecosystem work. The only other alternative is the overproliferation of parasites and a resulting value collapse of the ecosystem to humanity as it becomes too untrustworthy to use for a variety of things we&#x27;d really like to use it for. (That is, I&#x27;m not claiming that the Internet would become entirely useless, but we&#x27;d really <i>like</i> to be able to use it for important things, not just Buzzfeed and cat videos.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://33bits.org/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://33bits.org/about/</a>",1430407703

...In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.

Similarly, press Alt+5 for a registers window, and right click to select register set(s). (This particular bit of UI isn&#x27;t exactly amazing, but it does basically work.) Or, for getting an assembly language listing from a build, go to the project properties and select listing file format &quot;Assembly, machine code and source&quot;. The format is quite readable.)<p>Things I quite like about it:<p>- no grammar to the command set, just keypresses, and no need to press Return. gdb drives me nuts with its command line... feels like trying to count while somebody shouts random numbers in my ear. I&#x27;d probably get on better with a command-line driven version of Photoshop than I do with command-line controlled debuggers<p>- passable support for mixed assembly language/source code debugging (same step commands in all cases)<p>- dockable UI that&#x27;s satisfactorily configurable and updates as you work, so you can see a lot of stuff at once. I find the gdb text-based UI like trying to look through a telescope the wrong way, and it&#x27;s even worse if you go for the line-by-line TTY mode<p>- it displays code using the normal VS editor, so you can use the code browsing functionality to look around the code as you work<p>There&#x27;s plenty of scope for improvement, so while it does a reasonable job, I&#x27;m maybe not sure about &quot;best&quot;. But... I don&#x27;t appear to be unique in preferring it to gdb. So if we&#x27;re going for some kind of democratic vote, then maybe an argument could be made ;)<p>But overall, the main thing I like about the VS debugger is that it&#x27;s integrated quite well into the VS workflow. When you run your project in VS, you run it under the debugger. You have other options, it&#x27;s true - but running under the debugger is the most obvious one, so that&#x27;s what you do. There are times where you need rather complicated stuff doing, and VS is sadly lacking in that regard. But most of the time, when your code fucks up, the VS debugger provides enough to let you figure the problem out, and your code is already running under it, so there you go.<p>(I never found a way to get gdb working quite so well - it starts out with your process stopped, for example, so you have to type &quot;run&quot; to get it going. And I never figured out any way to stop your process without being dumped back to the gdb prompt, like Shift+F5 in Visual Studio. If I actually liked working in gdb, I&#x27;d probably just get over this, and/or put the time in to figure out how to fix it. But... I don&#x27;t.)",1430407297

For that a tablet does rather well and can be more convenient to carry around than a laptop. That seems to be the most common use for ~10 inch tablets in my experience, I know many people who use them quite a lot that way.<p>If you have relatively large pockets a 7 inch tablet is quite carryable and does noticeably better for video and text reading IMO due to the larger screen unless you have a huge phone (though huge phones are getting more and more common - I use a tablet a less now I have a 5&quot; phone screen).<p>You sound like you need at least one step more than that though, at which point yes you will probably find a tablet frustrating as it nearly does what you want but is far enough away to not be practical. Something like a transformer might work, but they tend to be pretty expensive. I have a &quot;poor man&#x27;s&quot; version of that: an 8 inch tablet (both my winter and summer coats have large inner pockets!) with a bluetooth keyboard & mouse and a simple stand for when I need/want to use it more like a laptop. The tablet was less than 100ukp so the who kit cost a chunk less than a laptop or a transformer-style hybrid. It runs full Windows too which is a bonus for me (it means I can run anything I do at home rather than being limited to tablet apps) though the Windows desktop interface can be a bit fiddly at that size unless you drop the DPI a bit. There are similar 10 inch devices too if you want something with a bigger screen.<p>Of course a tablet may just not cover your use cases at all. Different strokes for different folks!<p>There is a lot of one-up-man-ship in tablet owning of course especially in the case of iDevices in my experience - in some circles having the latest of those is a style statement, and some people just get bought them as presents, though I&#x27;ll stick to talking about more practical reasons for ownership!",1430407286

Copy of the question:<p>I have written a few small programs in Python and C++ and am currently learning F# (I am already quite familiar with FP concepts, as a result of reading the Learn you some Haskell tutorial until the monad part ;) ). And while I appreciate the elegance of functional programming in some situations, in other situations I just feel that it would be more natural to write a particular algorithm imperatively with mutation and I certainly can&#x27;t imagine programming my Arduino board in a functional way for example.<p>It often seems that today imperative programming is considered outdated and inferior to functional programming. So my question basically is: does imperative programming have a future outside of some niches? What do people with practical experience with both functional and imperative programming think? Will the programming world slowly shift to functional programming languages or will functional programming languages merely continue to influence imperative programming languages, leading to tacked on FP features (like in the latest versions of Java and C# and Ruby, Python etc.) or is functional programming in mainstream languages just a hype all together?",1430407131

For all of the other lightweight tasks, I had been using smart phones since the early Treo days so that was fine for email and looking up info.<p>But then I was planning a longer trip from the US to Southeast Asia for several weeks and it was going to involve a lot of hopping from town to town.  Suddenly even my laptop was too much to carry when I already had everything on my back.  I caved and bought an iPad 2 for a good deal more than I wanted to spend.  They were still hard to find so I could only find the larger capacity models and the only Android tablet worth considering (Xoom) was not as capable and still cost about the same.<p>That iPad was pretty cool and I used it for a year or two before it just got to be a pain in the ass.  Updates were de facto mandatory as you mentioned.  Staying on old OS versions meant unsupported apps and constant nagging.  But each OS update made the thing perform worse and worse.  The hardware cycle was much faster than that of desktop/laptop computers at that point so I couldn&#x27;t assume the normal 5+ years of usefulness I&#x27;d get from a laptop and there&#x27;s no option to just install a lightweight Linux distro or downgrade.  Even after I jailbroke it I couldn&#x27;t really do much to speed it up.  At this point, doing more than opening a single browser tab or lightweight application will make the thing lag and stutter and generall suck.<p>I think now it gets powered on a few times a year for me to check on updates and see if there&#x27;s anything worth checking out.

The index must already have been defined on table_name.<p>When a table is clustered, it is physically reordered based on the index information. Clustering is a one-time operation: when the table is subsequently updated, the changes are not clustered. That is, no attempt is made to store new or updated rows according to their index order. (If one wishes, one can periodically recluster by issuing the command again. Also, setting the table&#x27;s FILLFACTOR storage parameter to less than 100% can aid in preserving cluster ordering during updates, since updated rows are kept on the same page if enough space is available there.)<p>When a table is clustered, PostgreSQL remembers which index it was clustered by. The form CLUSTER table_name reclusters the table using the same index as before. You can also use the CLUSTER or SET WITHOUT CLUSTER forms of ALTER TABLE to set the index to be used for future cluster operations, or to clear any previous setting.",1430406739

Having to log or monitor internet traffic is the special case, and should not be the default.<p>> That privacy and safety stand in a big conflict was recently quite dramatically demonstrated when a pilot hid his psychological problems from his employer and intentionally caused a plane to crash.<p>You claim a background in psychology, you should be able to recognise this as fear mongering.<p>> The trust there is acquired by giving someone at a specific (private!) institution money and a copy of a passport. This system does not scale, and the number of SSL hosts is exploding.<p>A technological limitation in the current state of internet crypto is not a reason to abandon the concept.  Everyone agrees that the concept of a CA isn&#x27;t great.  Someone will solve the problem eventually.<p>> SSL is bloody expensive compared to not doing it.<p>SSL is largely implemented in hardware these days.  This is no longer true.<p>> SSL scales really badly intentionally.<p>I find it hard to accept that someone sat down and designed a system to not scale intentionally.  Especially hard to believe when you look at the scale of SSL deployment today.<p>> A big cost of encryption however is lawful interception. This is not the place to discuss if governments should have the ability to intercept your internet traffic or not but in many cases they have that right.<p>A big cost of any societal construct is law enforcement.  You can make the same argument about cars, or wigs, or plastic surgery.

I&#x27;m firmly of the opinion that none of that would have happened if SSL traffic was less common.<p>MITM is the default with unsecured traffic.  Again, TLS isn&#x27;t perfect, but why give up?<p>> To give you an example of how ridiculous our love for SSL has become: PyPI. It&#x27;s the Python package service. As of recently the Python package installer downloads every package via SSL. Why? There is no technical reason for this unless you want to hide from someone that you are downloading a specific Python package which seems pointless.<p>NO!!!!! Package managers are a huge target!

Well, 400 euros for a wall map seems like a lot of money, but what isn&#x27;t described very well is how the source file was created. It seems like the guy was manually stitching screenshots. God knows how much time did this take.

Unfortunately because it means that if a website hosts partially illegal shared content, then the whole website is down and not just the subsets of it which are legally problematic.<p>>But not everybody is entitled to privacy in all situations. For instance convicted criminals are not. Likewise many lawful professions need to be heavily surveyed for security.<p>>a pilot hid his psychological problems from his employer and intentionally caused a plane to crash.<p>In my view this is all valid reasons to encrypt everything.  When prisoners are made such based on unjust laws, I say that anything that gives them their rights is good.  Forcing a government to be very overt about its censorship of websites is good.  Allowing people to hide their mental disorders in a world where a mental disorder is still seen as a moral failing is good.<p>Encrypting everything enforces a positive change on society.  Governments have to be more open about their censorship, allowing for greater discussion.  Dissidents can communicate in secret, allowing for greater freedom.  Critical systems have to be built so that a single individual cannot cause a large loss of life.  Groups that are required to be surveyed must directly incorporate it into their systems<p>As for the cost of using SSL, my understanding is that they are much overstated.",1430406023

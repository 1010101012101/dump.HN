6535153,comment,6533653,6533653,8,0,tzs,,,"You are probably only looking at high level solutions, like Braintree.<p>Take a look at the more do-it-yourself solutions, and you&#x27;ll see different numbers. For instance, we have a merchant account with Merchant e-Solutions. The base rate is 2.19% + $.20/transaction. I say &quot;base rate&quot; because there are other costs that depend on the particular card.<p>For example, for Visa there are these:<p> &quot;Acquirer Processing Fee&quot;, $0.0195/transaction.<p> AVS fee, $0.01/transaction, only applies to transactions that make use of the address verification service.<p> 0.097% if the card is a commercial rewards card. (10% of the cards)<p> 0.45% &quot;international acquiring fee&quot; if the card is international, and 0.40% &quot;international service assessment&quot; on top of that.<p> 2.39% labeled as &quot;VISA NON-QUAL&quot;. I have no idea what the criteria for this is, but it gets applied to about 5% of the cards.<p>So, the actual cost of a transaction for a particular Visa card can be as low as 2.19% + $0.2195, and as high as 6.4% + $0.2295.<p>Last time I ran the numbers, it worked out that for Visa cards it averaged out to 2.62% + $0.23/transaction, and for MasterCard 2.80% + $0.23/transaction.<p>The downside to this is that providers that offer this kind of fine grained pricing tend to be targeted toward merchants who are looking for low level solutions--merchants handling their own credit card storage, doing their own recurring billing, and so on.<p>That is probably not a road you want to go down, especially if you are small and just starting out, and doubly especially if your servers are not servers you own. Doing PCI complaint credit card handling in the cloud on something like AWS is difficult and not something you want to deal with while dealing with the other aspects of a young business, like developing and promoting and supporting your product.",1381517884

A large part of it was about Ruby and Python shops that added Haskell to their toolbox in order to clean up overly complex parts of their codebase.<p>As far as the supply of programmers is concerned, if a software developer is TRULY talented, then they will be able to learn a new language in a couple of days, and learn a new paradigm (such as functional programming) in a couple of weeks. I say this as a person who has moved from imperative programming to object-oriented programming to functional programming over my career. And I have used so many languages that I have difficulty even enumerating all of them. They range from machine language, to various assembly languages to FORTRAN, COBOL, C, Visual BASIC, Java, Python, Ruby, Scala. The hard part of programming is not the coding. It is the DESIGNING.

(you might argue that the software is trusted: but you can verify that too, if you have the interest and resources)<p>Practically everything that Bitcoin does is a pure mathematical function. So long as everyone applies the same rules they will also come to the same conclusion about what the state of the system is autonomy and consensus are not incompatible.<p>Unfortunately, there is _one_ thing that can&#x27;t be decided autonomously with consensus in a distributed environment of mutual distrust:  Transaction ordering.  There are a bunch of superficial reasons why this must be so, but it can also be understood from the perspective of relativity: The apparent order of events depends on your frame of reference. Without a single privileged point of observation ordering can be ambiguous.<p>Ordering is important because the order decides which of any repeated spends of a coin is the correct one. Bitcoin uses a special kind of election to decide ordering, since consensus order cannot be achieved autonomously like everything else.  Instead of voting by number of people or by number of computers which is easily compromised by sibyl attackers it votes using energy:  The network selects the history that has the most sum-total energy spent crunching on it.<p>Because the energy is spent confirming the whole of the history, going back and reordering old parts becomes very costly the further back you go... and participants who don&#x27;t go along with such an effort have an inherent advantage, since they&#x27;re not losing the sum total of work after that point.  And even then all they can do is reorder the history, they couldn&#x27;t reassign coins without having ever owned them.<p>The people spending energy to validate transactions have their rational incentives largely aligned with the rest of the system by virtue of the fact that if they spend energy on a losing version of history, that energy is lost forever and any income they would receive from subsidy (the initial minting of coins) or transaction fees is lost forever. Their income is generally maximized by mining on the single chain with the best odds of surviving, and this makes the system converge.<p>So could some quorum of Bitcoin users seize back the coins? If by quorum you mean all surviving users after the change, yes: If all the users want to change the software can be rewritten arbitrarily. But it would sort of moot the system if they did. Could a simple majority do it? No way.  Bitcoin isn&#x27;t that kind of consensus.",1381517446

The thing is, all those would limit choices, the effect of which would be an object of hate. In addition, in USSR people were directed (or at most offered a choice of a few options) to planned working places where they should live and work, which was in fact just the way they were given many of the other things. As expected, that only spawned an underground markets (for products, services, and even for perspectives) on which were traded choices that weren&#x27;t freely available. I think therefore that it&#x27;s better to let everything on the table for the benefit of all.<p>About the quantity of money, maybe it would be best if this &quot;citizen allowance&quot; to be not a fixed sum, but calculated from how much the state can afford to give. Say it is 50% of the entire budget split on the number of citizens. More money gathered in budget - more per allowance, and if the allowance is getting smaller - the more people are encouraged to get involved as taxpayers.

It was a mass damper inside the nosecone, which meant that the moving masses were never exposed to the air outside the car.  It was ruled that by influencing the movement of the front wing (maintaining it at a more optimal height), it was therefore a moveable aerodynamic device.  The sad part of this story is that the regulators didn&#x27;t actually understand what benefit the device was supposed to provide, which was to allow for a more compliant suspension (a non aerodynamic advantage), and in fact Mclaren had a suspension element, the interter, which did effectively the same thing, but was not banned.",1381517141

You might as well use a 1st level cache. The difference between the cache and the register file ist mostly how the instruction set architecture references it. Registers are usually easier to acces because each one has a single name and the CPU can detect dependencies and conflicts easily.

A more applicable example of the rule was the late 70s brabham fan car which used a large fan at the rear (ostensibly for engine cooling purposes) to suck out air from the underside of the car to add downforce.  Think of the hyperloop design, in reverse.<p>By making the only physical moving part in the f-duct design the driver (who obviously has to be allowed to move), the devices cleverly adhered to the letter of the law.  The driver would close a hole in the cockpit which allowed some air to pass or not to a fluidic switch (think of a transistor), which would influence the flow of a larger stream of air to the rear wing).<p>One issue with banning the engine mapping that blew the diffuser off throttle was that this was already being done by many engine manufacturers for engine cooling purposes, and thus could not be easily regulated.  Even their year end attempt at a fix by specifying the location, pointing direction, etc of the exhaust outlets didn&#x27;t work (see coanda effect / downwash exhausts of 2012).  They have finally addressed the solution in 2014 regulations by specifying that the exhaust outlet has to be behind all bodywork.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that exhaust blown diffusers are more than a decade old, but in the past suffered from the problem of changing the balance of the car drastically mid throttle (when the driver gets on the throttle) due to 1) less advanced engine mapping), and 2) directly feeding into the diffuser venturis.  In fact, for a long time, the standard solution (periscope exhausts pioneered by ferrari), sought to remove as much influence of exhaust air on the aerodynamics as possible to make the car&#x27;s balance unaffected by engine exhaust volume, so given that environment, no one was worried about anyone using the exhaust for aerodynamic benefit.  The modern (Red bull design) blown diffusers only channel a relatively small portion of exhaust air directly into the diffuser channel, and instead use a large portion of exhaust to blow over the top of the diffuser itself (enhancing the diffuser effect), and on the side of the diffuser (to provide a air skirt that prevents squirt air from the rear tires bleeding into the diffuser from the side which decreases efficiency), particularly on cars like the Red bull which run a high level of rake (which enhances aerodynamic downforce separately by placing the front wing closer to the ground but makes the diffuser more vulnerable to tire squirt and other effects).",1381514829

A revenue-neutral carbon tax, for instance  a lot of taxes would be collected, on the theory of limiting output, or maybe you could use the theory that you were charging for access to the environmental load, which is a public resource held equally by all people.  To make it revenue neutral then you have to return that tax money to people.  You could cut taxes or put it some bullshit &quot;lock box&quot; but that&#x27;s nonsense thinking.

If you think that the government does a poor job of allocating the absolutely colossal amounts of money currently spent by social programs, or you recognize that trying to &quot;do a good job&quot; and prevent fraud, and all the other social engineering requires a vast, wasteful bureaucracy, then this is an interesting option.<p>This is a program that eliminates extreme poverty, but requires almost no infrastructure. You&#x27;d only need to verify that recipients are citizens and that they file their taxes. Since you can abolish Social Security, a stripped down social security bureaucracy, which already prevents people who haven&#x27;t paid into social security from receiving benefits, could take over that task.<p>It could allow one of the largest and most sweeping reductions in the size of government in our lifetimes.<p>And if you believe in freedom, but also want to live in a country where people don&#x27;t have to beg for food, then this is your best bet.  You trust people to make their own decisions about what benefits them and their family.

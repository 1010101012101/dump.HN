8547868,comment,8546569,8547146,0,0,crazy1van,,,"> How many times to you think companies would pay to run a connection to a house? After the first, or maybe even the second time, does the financial payback for laying additional redundant physical lines make sense?<p>I think that depends on the current market. If there&#x27;s room to make money in the long run by either offering better service or cheaper service, then I think companies will take the plunge and run the cables. In my area, we had DSL over phone lines and cable internet over coax for years. That didn&#x27;t stop Verizon from laying all new fiber to nearly every house in the area. They smelled profit in doubling existing internet speeds in my area. What did nearly stop them was intense lobbying by the existing players to deny them access to run cable.<p>What bothers me is that it required huge lobbying muscles to get through the red tape. What about all the other less politically connected companies with innovative ideas that could revolutionize our connectivity in ways most people have never considered? That&#x27;s the beauty of the Internet. Got a great idea for a new web service? There&#x27;s no government wheels to grease, no need to lobby the FCC for broadcasting permission. You just do it and let the consumer decide your fate.",1414958398

I ended up blindly installing some sketchy application. OK this is my own fault, I <i>should</i> be savvy enough to spot this. I imagine that this trick hooks the generally population on a regular basis.<p>Another modern classic I see is content with numbered pages, where the user must click next to continue reading, and adverts that look like large next buttons.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that this is the case and I don&#x27;t know what the solution is that will allow companies to have a decent revenue stream whilst protecting their users.<p>Adblock detection is pretty effective so blocking users is one option.<p>Maybe if an advertiser started to produce higher quality results then they&#x27;d gain some trust.

8547845,comment,8546546,8547415,0,0,adrusi,,,"I&#x27;ve followed rust for a couple years, never done anything major with it.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have coroutines, but they might be possible to implement using a macro that expands to an iterator implementation. It also has go-like channels and can be used with both N:M (green) threads and os-native 1:1 threads. It handles streams of data quite well.<p>All variables and references in Rust are immutable by default and accessing global mutable state can only be done in explicitly marked unsafe code. I <i>think</i> that all functions that have no &quot;mut&quot; or &quot;unsafe&quot; in their signature are pure unless they use an &quot;unsafe&quot; block. Exposing unsafe behavior in a safe interface is a contract violation and considered a bug.<p>There&#x27;s no built in laziness, but because Rust allows for overloading the pointer dereference operator, it should be possible to implement thunks in a syntactically transparent way.<p>Rust has a full macro system. There are AST-based macros for when you need a serious amount of power, but most macros are implemented on a partially structured token stream and are implemented a lot like scheme&#x27;s syntax-case. It&#x27;s a lot cleaner than metaprogramming in dynamic languages like python and ruby IMO, and it has no runtime overhead.<p>Introspection? No, but I think doing something about that is on the post-1.0 roadmap.<p>Garbage collection. A reference-counted pointer like C++11&#x27;s shared_ptr is available in the standard library. Its use is discouraged, though, in favor of structuring your code to work with Rust&#x27;s lifetime system and borrow checker. Doing that, your memory is managed in a safe way with no runtime overhead, you don&#x27;t have to worry about reference cycles, and the structure it enforces in your code tends to be easier to follow (although often harder to come up with).<p>Rust isn&#x27;t really meant to be used in place of Scala, it&#x27;s more of a &quot;competitor&quot; to C++. It keeps C++&#x27;s promise of &quot;don&#x27;t pay for what you don&#x27;t use&quot; and strongly favors 0-cost abstractions. It differentiates itself from C++ by using more modern abstractions and garaunteeing safety.",1414958084

I&#x27;ve spent a decent amount of time figuring out how to make my programming experience better.<p>I&#x27;ve tried almost every editor out there: Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Textmate, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, and Atom. I&#x27;ve customized them all with plugins. I&#x27;ve even written plugins for most of them. My first editor was pico, quickly followed by Vim.<p>My toolsmithing goes beyond editors. I&#x27;ve tried different keyboard layouts to improve typing speed, settling on dvorak with qwerty shortcuts. I even gave chording keyboards a shot. I built Ag[1] to search code faster.[2]<p>I don&#x27;t own a mouse. If I want to point at something, I use a trackpad. Switching to/from it is much faster than grabbing a mouse.<p>People don&#x27;t want to hear this, but I could not be as fast in Vim. Even if Vim had every feature in my current setup, it would still be slower because Vimscript executes synchronously. Executing plugin code blocks Vim&#x27;s UI. If a plugin spawns a subprocess, the UI will be blocked until it exits.<p>With Vim, you can&#x27;t start a search and examine another file while it&#x27;s running. This problem can be worked-around by using multiple Vims or searching from the command line, but then you lose quick opening/replacing of results. You can also abuse certain AutoCmds and updatetime to get a sort-of working async execution, but it requires each plugin have its own event loop.<p>I agree with kansface: Vim users may type less, but they don&#x27;t move faster. I have yet to see a Vim user who has impressed me with their speed. I typically see wasted motion, waiting for commands to finish, and fixing mistakes in regexes. Even your example invocations are as good or better in Sublime Text.<p><i></i> <i>I want to add an extra parameter to this method I just wrote. ... I just press &quot;f)&quot; to jump to the closing parentheses and start adding text.</i><p>That does not jump to the end of the function definition. That does a search for ) on the current line. If your cursor isn&#x27;t on the right line, you&#x27;re SOL. Also, ) shows up in many places. It may not be part of a function definition in the language used. In my setup, &quot;cmd + r, up&quot; goes to the previous function definition no matter the language. If I want to go to the end, that&#x27;s ctrl + m.<p><i></i> <i>I want to replace everything on the current line, starting from my cursor position somewhere in the middle of that line. ... I instead just press &quot;c$&quot; and start adding text.</i><p>For me, that&#x27;s ctrl + shift + e, (start typing). Unless you have a $ key, both are three keystrokes.<p>If you use Vim and you&#x27;re happy with it, great. But I would heavily discourage anyone from switching to Vim. Editors and UIs have come a long way in the past 25 years. Even with nerdtree, YCM, and other plugins, Vim can&#x27;t catch up. NeoVim looks promising, since it fixes Vim&#x27;s architectural problems.<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/</a><p>2. <a href=""http://geoff.greer.fm/2011/12/27/the-silver-searcher-better-than-ack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geoff.greer.fm/2011/12/27/the-silver-searcher-better-...</a>",1414957466

So much so that you kinda have to take it with a grain of salt.<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure what to even think about NeoVim.  They&#x27;ve been plugging away for over a year, their GitHub repo has over a hundred contributors and two-thousand commits, and yet it&#x27;s still pre-alpha?  Also, the primary purpose seems to be allowing people to write Vim plugins in any programming language.  However, it&#x27;s not like the Vim ecosystem is hurting for plugins today.  Besides, the whole point of &quot;vimscript&quot; is that it&#x27;s self-contained and baked-in as part of the editor.  Totally cross-platform, and always there.  If I install a NeoVim plugin, then I have to make sure I have the right version of Ruby or Python or whatever on my box to support it?  Yuck, no thanks.<p>As near as I can tell, any real value-prop for NeoVim is using it as an embeddable component.  Like the Cloud9 guys&#x27; cloud-based Ace editor (<a href=""http://ace.c9.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ace.c9.io</a>), or as something that IDE makers could bake into their desktop IDE apps.

In fact, more or less the opposite is true. ... Cognitive tests correlate because all of them truly share one or more sources of variance.&quot;<p>(2) &quot;Shalizi’s second error is to disregard the large body of evidence that has been presented in support of g as a unidimensional scale of human psychological differences. The g factor is not just about the positive [correlation matrix]. A broad network of findings related to both social and biological variables indicates that people do in fact vary, both phenotypically and genetically, along this continuum that can be revealed by psychometric tests of intelligence and that has has widespread significance in human affairs.&quot;<p>(3) &quot;Shalizi’s third error is to think that were it shown that g is not a unitary variable neurobiologically, it would refute the concept of g. However, for most purposes, brain physiology is not the most relevant level of analysis of human intelligence. What matters is that g is a remarkably powerful and robust variable that has great explanatory force in understanding human behavior. Thus g exists at the behavioral level regardless of what its neurobiological underpinnings are like.&quot;<p>Conclusion: &quot;In many ways, criticisms of g like Shalizi’s amount to “sure, it works in practice, but I don’t think it works in theory”. Shalizi faults g for being a “black box theory” that does not provide a mechanistic explanation of the workings of intelligence, disparaging psychometric measurement of intelligence as a mere “stop-gap” rather than a genuine scientific breakthrough. However, the fact that psychometricians have traditionally been primarily interested in validity and reliability is a feature, not a bug. Intelligence testing, unlike most fields of psychology and social science, is highly practical, being widely applied to diagnose learning problems and medical conditions and to select students and employees. What is important is that IQ tests reliably measure an important human characteristic, not the particular underlying neurobiological mechanisms.&quot;",1414955744

Cantonese and Mandarin split roughly 1000 years ago, whereas the difference between Shakespearian English (which is considered Early Modern English) and Modern English is only a few hundred years. In addition, Modern English is a descendant of Early Modern English whereas Cantonese and Mandarin are not descendants of one another.<p>The Chinese writing system tends to obscure these differences because cognates among the different varieties of Chinese are represented using the same characters, even though their pronunciations have diverged considerably. There are vocabulary and grammatical differences as well, though they are not as big.<p>The difference is more akin to if English speakers had to write in German†, but because they generally don&#x27;t know how to actually speak German, they would read it using English pronunciation instead. For instance, if you wanted to say &quot;I know that you said that&quot;, you might have to write:<p><pre><code>    Ich weiß dass du das gesagt hast.\n</code></pre>\nBut you would read it &quot;in your own language&quot; as:<p><pre><code>    I wit that thou that y-said hast.\n</code></pre>\nThis is similar to the current relationship between Cantonese and Mandarin. Cantonese speakers write in Mandarin (i.e. &quot;Standard Chinese&quot;) and read it &quot;in Cantonese&quot;, even though when speaking, they would really say something almost completely different. When Cantonese speakers actually write in Cantonese, Mandarin speakers generally would have difficulty reading it.<p>† The difference between English and German actually spans more than 1000 years, but I&#x27;m not as familiar with other closer Germanic languages with which to provide a good example.",1414955003

Multi-billion dollar highways enable sprawl and cheaper commercial parking lots.  Driving & parking personal vehicles is incredibly wasteful from a broad economic perspective (but it was the correct path -- a necessary evil in the absence of density to enable effective mass transit).<p>Even with the government subsidies, Uber is an economically competitive alternative to driving & parking personal vehicles.

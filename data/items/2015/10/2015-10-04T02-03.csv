It could be actually free with ads...&quot;</i><p>I don&#x27;t see how self-driving car services could be &quot;almost free&quot;. Self-driving cars cost money to manufacture. Like all mechanical equipment, they have finite lifetimes, so their purchase cost needs to be paid back over that lifetime. They need to be maintained, e.g., tires and shocks don&#x27;t last forever, and metal corrodes over time (especially in environments where roads are salted for de-icing). Someone will need to clean the interiors every day (or more often), since people tend to leave messes (sometimes really disgusting ones).<p>The power for them isn&#x27;t free. Even if they&#x27;re solar powered, solar panels have to be manufactured, installed and maintained (e.g., cleaned off periodically to maintain maximum efficiency), and they need to be replaced after their finite lifetimes expire. Rechargeable batteries need to be replaced after a certain number of recharge cycles.<p>Roads, bridges and tunnels cost as much to maintain for self-driving cars as for conventional cars. There will still be tolls and taxes. As gas and diesel vehicles die off, the revenue from the taxes on their fuel will need to be replaced by other taxes, such as per-mile taxes on electric vehicles.<p>I doesn&#x27;t seem that merely showing ads to passengers could pay for all these capital, labor and tax expenses. And if the cars are owned by a for-profit company such as Uber, there has to be enough income for the company to have a profit after paying their operating costs and taxes.",1443927279

This will normally involve you conducting the development of software in high traffic sites, dealing with load balancing million+ visitor websites across several servers being served behind a top tier CDN, handling large scale caching on the code and database level, managing multiple terabytes or petabytes of storage, working with integrating Akamai into sites along with their security features and API, etc.<p>You will normally also be an expert at certain database technology included PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, and caching technology Memcached, Redis, Zend Optimizer, OpCache, etc.<p>You will also need to be able to engineer solutions that scale appropriately including hardware and software, train other developers and sometimes system administrators, work with senior management, write tons of detailed documentation, conduct security reviews, developer interviews, and more.  Also conducting performance optimizations at the high and low level is also standard as you might have to write custom php extensions in C for functionality you might need or want more of a speed boost out that is not offered by default.<p>Once you get to this level most of your job will involve many questions from other developers or senior managers about higher level engineering and architectural work as you almost find yourself in a managerial type role.  This will normally involve more reading and writing development guidelines, helping with writing policy, security documentation and guidelines.<p>Just remember, learning the programming language and a framework is only a small part of becoming a senior developer.  Only until you have the skill set to do the upper tier work that is in high demand and low supply will you then be in the senior developer / engineer group.  It is not hard to make it there, but it does take some time and experience.  As getting the jobs that involve more development and hard high end integration work are very competitive and normally have some very high requirements for entry.<p>I recommend checking out the senior developer and engineering jobs at large companies to get a better idea of what many companies are looking for and start working towards those goals, especially if the companies are close to you.",1443926777

This is not assertions on Hacker News about how you must have something to hide if you want to keep something private. This is not about a man in a position of power and influence, who has industry privilege and respect for his wealth and status, at Google or Facebook saying that anonymity, or multiple online identities, demotes a &#x27;lack of credibility’.

the details of IBM&#x27;s VM
and a little about VMware.<p>I have wondered:  The way
VM has worked on IBM mainframe
instruction set has been
partly due to an accident of
the design of that instruction
set and, then, some extensions
for VM.  Really, that way, tough
for the program running to
know if it is running as a
virtual machine or not.  So,
in particular, the program
running on VM can
be using privileged
instructions and not know
that it doesn&#x27;t really
have access to the real hardware.<p>So
I&#x27;ve wondered 
if the Intel x86 instruction set
also has this accident and, thus,
can run operating systems that
use privileged instructions
but not know they are running
on a VM.  Or maybe the ability
to run on a VM was from some
extensions to the Intel
instruction set.  Do you know?<p>Does the Microsoft CLI/CLR
software have some
security features beyond
just any <i>native</i> program
in, say, Fortran or assembler
running in an address space, 
process, or whatever Microsoft
calls where a program runs?<p>I&#x27;m beginning to get the
prerequisites for reading
the OP, that is, understanding
what the long standard alternative
to native code has been.<p>Heck, I can understand native
code -- at one time I 
entered some simple programs
via the computer console
sense switches.  And I printed
out the <i>object</i> listing
from a Fortran compiler
and went over the 
machine language instructions
one by one.  I discovered that
even for some simple code
and a good Fortran compiler,
assembler could be faster
by a factor of several.<p>Just read the Wikipedia 
article.  Nice and easy.<p>Thanks.",1443925576

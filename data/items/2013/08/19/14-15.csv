6237544,comment,6236309,6236309,9,0,sampo,,,"Here&#x27;s a comment I also left at the website:<p>I read the original article, and Wang et al. measure fitness by (i) measuring photosynthesis in glasshouse-grown plants (ii) measuring seed germination on wet paper in petri dishes and (iii) growing plants in garden (grown 20 cm apart, fertilized, hand-weeding and insecticides applied).<p>We probably can assume that the extra copies of EPSP synthase genes increase the metabolic throughput (by boosting some of the protein synthesis pathways) of the plants, and when grown in abundant light (20 cm apart, no shadowing and competition from neighbouring plants), water and nitrogen (grown in garden conditions, fertilized), it is plausible that these individual grow faster and larger. This is all that Wang et al. did and all that their article claims.<p>The higher throughput capacity only comes into use if supplies of energy or raw materials are not bottlenecks.<p>But the Nature News conclusions &quot;effects of such modification have the potential to extend beyond farms and into the wild&quot; and &quot;genetic diversity [of wild rice], which is really important to conserve, could be threatened because the genotype with the transgene would outcompete the normal species&quot; are very much unsupported by the results of Wang et al.<p>In the wild, seeds may need to germinate in more challenging conditions that wet paper on a petri dish, there may not be abundant light, nitrogen or water.<p>So the EPSP synthase -boosted plants grow better in the garden. But maybe there is a good reason why the EPSP synthase levels are lower in the plants from the wild. Maybe something else is more valuable to them, something that helps in e.g. low-light photosynthesis, nutrient or water uptake in scarce conditions, or defence against insects. Maybe the wild EPSP levels are just optimal for growing in wild conditions and the plants with boosted EPSP synthase levels would have lower fitness in wild conditions. (I assume that the higher levels of the synthase don&#x27;t come for free, but have a related metabolic cost that cannot then be used elsewhere).<p>As Wang et al. only measured fitness in garden, not in the wild, the Nature News conclusions are unwarranted.",1376924265

I only have one issue and that is the question of what causes pointless jobs.<p>Graeber suggests this was a decision by the ruling class, collectively, to push us to work harder and keep us from being the competition.  To some extent there is some support for that.  One of Hilaire Belloc&#x27;s complaints about the early welfare state was that it would effectively chain people to corporate work.<p>But I don&#x27;t think it is the whole or even the primary driver.  One of the most interesting books I think one can read is &quot;The Collapse of Complex Civilizations&quot; by Joseph Tainter (another anthropology professor) who suggests that the rise of these sorts of paper pushing jobs is caused not by a desire to keep the poor poor and dependent on work (something early Capitalists like Adam Smith advocated outright) but as an overall measure of complexity.  These are coordination jobs.  They have become at once pointless and necessary.<p>Take for example Graeber&#x27;s example of corporate lawyers.  These jobs are needed because we have seen an explosion in the complexity of corporate law.  Corporate lawyers thus effectively pilot a corporation through hazardous legal waters (with the officers still nominally at the helm).  The job is BS.  The job is necessary because we had problems and passed laws, and now everyone needs corporate lawyers.<p>Interestingly Graeber&#x27;s view is much more optimistic than Tainter&#x27;s.  If Graeber is right the world will hum along with or without these complexity-related jobs.  But if Tainter is right then we are nearing a danger zone where we risk societal collapse when the complexity becomes one level too high.  I hope Graeber is right, but in my heart I fear and believe that Tainter is.",1376922205

6237239,comment,6236933,6236933,8,0,snowwrestler,,,"> The MIT professor lays out how the majority of U.S. policies are opposed to what wide swaths of the public want<p>This is a feature of the design of the U.S. federal government. The framers of the Constitution were very familiar with the history of governments and knew that direct democracy was a disaster. It devolves into mob rule, and let&#x27;s face it, most people don&#x27;t know much about most things.<p>Chomsky says that the lower 70% of the population has no effect on policy, but there is plenty of evidence to the contrary. The U.S. system of income taxation is progressive and refundable, meaning that there is substantial transfer of wealth from the richest people to the poorest. The upper income brackets pay a disproportionately large percentage of all income taxes.<p>U.S. states fund universal public education through high school; a policy that benefits the poor and middle class far more than the rich, who can afford to send their children to private schools. Health care funding like Medicare and Medicaid<p>I&#x27;m not saying that these are bad! Just that they demonstrate the extent to which U.S. policy does benefit a broader swath of the population than you might think from reading this essay.<p>Ironically, some of the things that Noam Chomsky likes the least are in fact popular with a majority of the U.S. population. Pew reports that 61% of American citizens approve of the drone assassination program, for instance [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/25/big-gender-gap-in-global-public-opinion-about-use-of-drones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/25/big-gender-g...</a>",1376920861

Wasn&#x27;t like that in the &#x27;30s); housing; medicine.<p>In the &#x27;30s my great uncle was given a house as a wedding present. His siblings also got houses when they got married. Can you imagine something like that today? Gifting your children something that, in today&#x27;s age, costs $100,000 (and sometimes 2x-3x more)?!<p>Of course we buy more things, and I know my grandparents didn&#x27;t spend money on a smartphone every 2 years or have a $100/month cable bill. But blowing $2K on a TV is a drop in the bucket when you have a $200K mortgage (aka: debt).<p>I&#x27;m willing/able to live cheaply, and buy less things, but my creditors (the big three, above) want their bills paid. So I can&#x27;t &quot;just&quot; work half time at the code factory and get paid 50% less, because I have debts the like which people in the &#x27;30s would have no idea about.<p>(&quot;You mean going to the doctor could be 1-2 months worth of take home pay, even with this &#x27;insurance&#x27; that costs 10% of your take home pay??&quot;)",1376920815

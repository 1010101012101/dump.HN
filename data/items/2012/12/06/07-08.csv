They're often also covered by a ridiculous number of patents.<p>The ITU organization doesn't seem to be capable of producing anything that doesn't cost billions of dollars to implement.  Just from a purely technical standpoint, the ITU's history does not suggest that putting them in charge would be good for interoperability, competition, or technological progress.",1354780769

Developing for iOS is far easier than Android.<p>Sure the Mac is becoming more of an appliance but with stagnant hardware speeds is it that big of a deal? Also, Apple has been hostile to DIY repairs and add-ons since forever. I remember being 12 years old arguing on the 1-800-APPL-SOS help line that 3rd party RAM was not causing my problem and no I wouldn't uninstall it to get help.<p>Apple relies on its developers to power the App Store. They (hopefully) won't forget that. I'm not worried.<p>You don't hear anyone ever talking about how awesome Apple Logic is for making music or how easy Final Cut Pro is for video. They still make them and they're great quality. Just because the masses of Apple reporters aren't focused on your baby doesn't mean Apple doesn't care about it.

Automatic updates are great. The problems is that users can not turn it off completely. Even if you disable automatic updates in windows, some updates will still be pushed regardless.  Windows has demonstrated this in the past, and said (when asked about it) that they wont use that feature other than when ""needed"", but that fact that they can do this mean that they can turn it over to who ever, when ever, and for any reason that makes business sense to do so.<p>How does Windows spy on users. Over the time of windows history, users has found out that windows sends back a list over installed programs, encrypted to Microsoft, through I do not remember if they included statistics over usage. Now days, a default installed windows 8 machine will a) inform Microsoft each time you install a new program (to check for malware), and b) each time you visit a website with IE (to check for malware again), and c) your IP address each time you connect to the internet (to check if your internet connection works). You might be able to turn of some of those ""features"", but honestly, I don't know. In Windows xp, you could not disable the statistics gather of installed programs, as Microsoft said they needed that to improve the experience of windows.

4880756,comment,4878393,4879461,1,0,ej3,,,"I came here to say this as well - Don't.  This is of course my own opinion, and I can only promise this comment will get progressively more subjective the farther you read.<p>R's documentation is terse and unorganized.  Anyone who says different is obviously someone with more experience with the language (which is not how it should be).  When people complain about the documentation it's because they're trying to learn, and if the documentation isn't together learning is painful.  Learning R is painful.<p>Next- Learning is painful, and the documentation is horrible because: the actual built in functions or extensions are a nightmare of arguments that [sometimes do/sometimes don't work].  If you plot x and you don't want the key to show up then set auto.key=FALSE, if you plot class(x) = [something else] and don't want the key to show up set colorkey=FALSE, if you want to layer plots: load this library and format your data to a new S3/S4 (object) type, add them together, then plot them (without the library you can't add these objects)... In case you didn't catch that: I wanted to layer the plots so I had to load a function that made the objects I wanted to plot add, not load a library that would change the plotting driver.<p>The community around R is disenchanted.  If you get into the right place on the web and ask about a feature that doesn't exist: more often than not I've seen the typical guru response of the type ""It doesn't work that way - that's a feature, not a problem.""  Change is bad, and in my experience generally discouraged.<p>Finally (and perhaps this really doesn't need to be said)  the more I've been working with it - the more I feel like the reason it is so popular is because you can load it up read your data set, google some of the more central functions, and <i>poof</i> - get that set of characteristic statistical answers everyone needs to have in their [presentation/HW assignment].  If you look at the answers in this thread you get 2 types A) it's impossible to use, B) it does standard statistical analysis really easily.  In my narrow world view it appeals to people who don't work with software a lot - professionals who need some automated numbers on the side without hiring someone to do it right.<p>That all said, I still do use R.  You can do some nifty statistical analysis pretty easily and push it to a vector plot, pop it open with your favorite editor and post edit it  super pretty (in a few days).",1354779488

Other than search and their foray into geo, Google seems to keep playing an exploratory game where they know the desired outcome but not entirely how to get there. And they're in a great position to develop expensive proof-of-concept projects to see which gets them closer to their goals.

When I came back from Jam Sessions at night I was so amped I could not get at sleep for maybe two hours. Then I turned on my computer and started writing java applications testing roulette systems. The fact you could spend your lifetime on finding THE SYSTEM was facinating to me. It is the same with music. It never ends. There are no limits. Having technical limits drives me crazy. And it drives me even more crazy if I have to wait for third party solutions. This is the point I start to create my own world and I am sure there are people out there dealing with the same issue as me. This is the way I came up with bandnova.",1393513255,1452922528

I am not a professional artist; I have a degree in Math, a serious day job and family duties like everybody else. I always loved to work with my hands, creating unusual gifts, drawing, sewing soft toys or even decorating friends wedding venue! And I pay a lot of attention to making my creations look sleek and professional. I think to get an Awwww! any project should be not only cute, but made to an exacting level of detail and accuracy. And I am a perfectionist, a hardworking, fairy tale obsessed perfectionist!<p>Until now all my creativity was reserved for my friends and relatives. But this summer there is something magical in the air, something making me brave enough to step forward and make my biggest art project so far.

The most recent systems I&#x27;ve worked on have been order of magnitude improvements over any existing system in areas like deep learning and network virtualizaton.

nurturing,0,1,0.0,1,0,"In the Nurture game you approach someone, friend or stranger, and perform a quick, unique inward action that stimulates oxytocin within yourself (in men as well as women). Temporarily, it creates  sympathetic feelings toward the other person. It can be done in person or by video chat on a smartphone.<p>You do it, then you let them know you did it, in a light-hearted, gentle way. (For instance: ""Guess what? I was just 'mothering' you."") You then briefly explain what you are doing, which is, creating caring emotions (versus destructive ones) in order to heal human relationships, and then, in time, heal the planet itself.<p>If your target likes what you are doing, first you have them join up on the Nurture website, then you ""deputize"" them to try the process on their own friends. This generates an MLM-like ""downline."" The desire to win small, humorous badges for successful recruitment, as well as the serious nature of the project, may cause the viral spread to move very fast.<p>Group activity centers on the Nurture bulletin board. At first, those with common interests will coalesce around their mutual objectives, like saving forests. We expect to prod these threads in the BB toward more ambitious projects like organizing the newly and increasingly disenfranchised middle class and longtime poor, and even perhaps  ultimately reorganizing the entire worldwide social system.  Given our very positive and nonviolent philosophy, any reorganization would be gentle, gradual, and nonviolent.<p>All will be driven by the common ethical attitude based on kindness, trust, and empathy. Utopian indeed. Yet there is also a monetary side, needed in any organization: housekeeping money to run the organization and for its projects. Such income could be generated through fund-raisers, membership fees, simple contributions, publications, political organizing, and the like.<p>NEEDS<p>I see a need, first of all, for a developer knowledgeable in iPhone programming, particularly video chat. This might include the jailbreaking of any closed, schrooted operating systems. iPhones could be used in ways I don't yet foresee. This would need to be a person conversant with, for instance, Facetime and Tango. Also, the website would need to be elaborated to accommodate new demands on it.<p>Secondly, I see a need for a marketer and fundraising specialist.",1311982709,1452896490

But it wasn't for the Middle East, and the reasons for the decline, being distant, were not immediately apparent to anyone.<p>More generally everyone who has learned even a little economics knows that when you open up trade, you improve production.  That's the whole point of comparative advantage.  <i>However</i> lurking in the math is that if 2 parties are engaged in trade, and the third is not, adding the third makes the total better off, but is not necessarily better for all parties.",1359341999

5126852,comment,5126061,5126061,1,0,truthhurts,,,"The Internets were developed by Al Gore at the request of the U.S. military in the early 1960s as an expedient means by which to share pornography between various installations in continental United States and later, in Europe and Asia. Pornography was largely illegal at the time and before the virtuous self-sacrifice of Larry Flynt, one could find a few tit shots here and there, but pink and penetration were considered criminal obscenity punishable by death, followed by castration. In order to evade mail searches by officious police and customs officials, Internet pornography was sent by means of kibbles n' bits n' bytes, which could only be deciphered by powerful computers. One of the primary goals for the nascent system was that it be hardened enough to be available after a nuclear war, at which point porn would help to pass the time waiting for your hair to fall out, and might even be exchangeable for money or (perversely) sex.<p>The Vietnam War spurred further development of the Internet, in order to both allow the transfer of high quality American pornography to the troops stationed in Asia, and allow fresh CP taken in Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand to quickly be transferred back to the United States. In the 1972, the decision was made to extend Internet service to American research universities, after sources at the Pentagon determined that students at MIT had a copy of Deep Throat that they would upload if given the opportunity. Although it is still often referred to as the Interweb, a reference to the spider web which once carried optical signals, this term is now technically incorrect, as information is now passed through a series of tubes, more akin to a sewer system.<p><a href=""https://encyclopediadramatica.se/Internet#History"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encyclopediadramatica.se/Internet#History</a>",1359341903
5126851,comment,5125699,5126136,7,0,NateDad,,,"Nothing says duck typing has to be at runtime.<p>The only requirement to duck typing is ""an object's methods and properties determine the valid semantics, rather than its inheritance from a particular class or implementation of a specific interface"".<p>This is exactly how Go's interfaces work. You define the methods you require an argument to have, and then anything that has those methods can be used as that argument, without the original type having any knowledge of the interface that was designed. The only difference between Go and Python in this regard is that Python doesn't actually define what a duck is for a specific method, it is implicitly defined by the methods that are called on it. Go explicitly defines what a duck is, which makes it a hell of a lot easier to know if the object you're passing in qualifies as a duck without reading every line in the damn function.<p>Yes, go checks that an object is a duck at compile time, that doesn't have anything to do with duck typing.",1359341899

We know the Earth is round, and orbits the Sun. We know roughly how and when the Earth and the Solar System formed. We know that every species on Earth shares an ancestor with every other one. We know the Universe has a Quantum nature (as described by QM) and that on large scales it follows principles laid out by Einstein. We can also trace the history of the Universe to within nanoseconds of its creation. And we've only been doing proper science for about 200 years, out of the 250,000 we as a species have been around.

They won't be able to prove anything, obviously, but they can muddy the waters and make your life hell.<p>Female-on-male stalking tends to come from the extremes of the popularity spectrum, not the middle of the curve, and those two extremes tend to produce different patterns of stalking. If she's obviously crazy and weird, then she's also unpopular. Her reputation is already damaged, but she doesn't care. Her situation is asymmetric warfare. I wouldn't even call it ""warfare"" at that point. It's just angry destruction. The bad news is that she's liable to become violent. The good news is that she has no credibility so, while it might be annoying to hear a crazy person using your name, nothing she says will stick.<p>The less common form tends to come from women who are high on the social spectrum. They tend not to be physically dangerous (they have decades of experience at hiding their craziness, and they know that physical intrusion will blow their credibility) but it's much more socially dangerous, because when they set out to ruin a man's reputation, they often succeed.<p>What the OP experienced appears to be a mix of those two, enabled by the largeness and credibility sparsity of a large society (e.g. the Internet).",1359340633

But whether or not you are making a derivative work does not have much to do with what bits of technology you use.  Of course, the questions are <i>related</i> because choices of technology can make the question about whether you are creating a derivative work more believable on one side than the other.  But if you making technology choices in the hope and on the sole basis that it has some impact on whether or not you are creating a derivative work, you are practicing cargo cult law, just the same as if you erase the experimental results table from your paper and hope it changes the gravitational constant.

I know sometimes it's hard to take a step back and see others' experience, so let me try to show you what I meant about difficulty.<p>Firstly, I am definitely not the garden-variety user when it comes to mobile devices. I was involved in the launch of the Galaxy Series devices and even spent time at Samsung HQ in Korea for this purpose, and have since run custom ROMs on my phone... so came to this with a relatively strong knowledge, compared to most.  If you can't make the process work for me, it's not going to work very well for others.<p>The build page you mentioned is not the right one for SGS2, which is an extremely popular device, yet in the category 'third tier' supported (ie. effectively ignored).<p>You should get someone from Samsung to solve this. They have entire skyscrapers devoted to different phone platforms at their headquarters in Suwon, Korea, made vast and record profits this last quarter, and it should not be an issue for them to provide a useful contact for their most popular devices.<p>Next point. Since the build process itself is IIRC is only supported on Ubuntu or something, I had to download that and set up an entire VM before cloning the code. Second, cloning the code takes years on a third-world connection (literally hours and hours, it's something like a few GB in size).<p>Third, it wasn't hugely clear that I needed to upgrade from a custom ROM with Ice Cream to a stock ROM with Ice Cream in order to install (in fact, the notion that the existing firmware would be hacked in to the new FFOS image was really not clear at all, and should have been). This resulted in builds failing in non-obvious ways.<p>Realizing the situation, since I didn't have a stock ROM image just lying around, now insert many hours of downloading different ROM images, trying to install them, getting errors with them.  If must have downloaded and tried at least five of these already.<p>There were also lots of fun errors related to a bug in recent versions of the upload tool, which bricked my phone.  Thankfully, because I am somewhat familiar with the Linux boot process and persistent, I did manage to unbrick the phone an eventually get what might be a valid Android ICS ROM going that might be good to install FFOS.<p>Unfortunately, after spending more than two days on this already, I simply didn't have time to continue prior to my current period of travel.<p>I am motivated to help, pre-experienced, willing to flash my device and use it on a daily basis even if it's going to reduce functionality vs. Android, but... FF(O)S, people! You can't provide a faster route to an install?<p>What would have made things easier was a source for something I could 'just flash'.  I don't care if it's semi or illegal and it comes from a torrent.  I have to go through those routes anyway just to get from Custom ROM -> ICS stock -> FFOS.

And frankly, the debuggers on Windows are just completely.. ahead.<p>The Visual Studio debugger can step from managed code, into C++/CLI semi managed code, into native code. It automatically downloads symbols for all system APIs you are ever going to encounter, providing symbols for internal functions, too. It has expression evaluation on all these layers. Theres also the standalone WinDbg debugger that most importantly does kernel mode debugging but is designed similarly to gdb.<p>Also, of course - edit and continue.

I have two useful tips.<p>The first one is that stalkers try to convince themselves that the object of their desire would love them back if they only had a chance.  When they learn otherwise, desire can easily flip to hatred, then to attempts to destroy a life.  Therefore if you are being stalked and can avoid letting the stalker know how you feel about it, do that.  You can see that one in play in this case where she pursued him for years, without the nasty behavior, until she realized that he didn't love her.  Then she turned vindictive.<p>The second tip is that if you're going to stalk someone, don't stalk a psychiatrist.  It is very, very hard for anyone other than a psychiatrist to get someone committed to an institution until after the stalker has committed a conventional crime.  However if you're stalking a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist can, as a professional psychiatrist, evaluate you and decide to institutionalize you.  And whatever institution you go to - which is generally associated with said psychiatrist - is likely to support the psychiatrist in that evaluation.",1359338698

Science is simply viewed as the study of God's creation.<p>of course it does , angel and djinns are not scientific facts , neither are people claiming they received the word of ""god"" from whatever spook out there...<p>Science looks at nature and try to draw conclusions , facts that one can experiment or things than can predict something. Prove me that djinns or angels exist as the reproducible phenomenon and i will believe in whatever fairy tail you believe in. Religion is based on faith since you cant reproduce any so called ""miracle"" written in holly books.<p>Read your sentence : your assume at first place everything is god creation , that's not how science works.<p>But i dont blame you , some believe in Hubbard or Smith , no matter how  smart they think they are. Just dont lie to yourself in saying religion doesnt contradict science , it is dishonest at best.",1359338558

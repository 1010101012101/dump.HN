We can decide to implement this ADT using, say, an array or a linked list. In either case, its operation will be the same (that is, you'll get the same results; but its time and space properties may be different).",1193932466

75073,comment,75045,75045,0,0,gigamon,,,"You don't need a lawyer.  You need common sense.<p>Why do you think you need to give someone 50% of YOUR company?  Is your product ready?  How much more work will it take before you are ready for revenues?  And when you are ready, how long will it take before you generate enough profit (not sales) that can support two full-time employees?   Is this person an employee or a co-Founder?  Are you giving this person 50% because you cannot afford to pay salary and are you giving this person 50% because you need his intellectual contribution in addition to effort?  Or are you just looking for a companion?  And if this is a co-Founder, will you need still outside funding (VC or angel) once the person joins you?<p>In other words, lawyer cannot protect you if you don't know what you want.  Work the problem backwards.  Think about building the company and not the product.  Focus on what the company would look like six months from today, two years from today, five years from today and then think about how to get there, with or without this new partner/employee.<p>Think about these questions first and then worry on the legal details.<p>--Denny--<p>Denny K Miu<p><a href=""http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/startup-for-less.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/startup-for-less.html</a>

75071,comment,75045,75045,0,0,ajkates,,,"So, you built an application by yourself, with no funding or help,and you're willing to give up 50% of the equity just like that?<p>I'd also recommend seeing a lawyer.  Additionally, a partnership may not be the best idea if you don't know and trust this second co-founder.  I'm no lawyer, but it sounds like an LLC might be a better choice.  You can vest his shares over a time period that you feel is appropriate, and include a clause in the operating agreement that discharges him if he fails to perform the duties required of him.<p>Again, I'd go see a lawyer.  It's not worth the headache later on.",1193931872

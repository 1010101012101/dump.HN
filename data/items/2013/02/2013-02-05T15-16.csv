5171292,comment,5171146,5171256,2,0,hodder,,,"Sorry, I deleted when I was editing the grammer.  I think the price is too low relative to the fundamentals of the business.  High returns on capital, decent 10/5 year average revenue growth.  Decent transitioning taking place. I think it is simply cheap on a FCF basis at 13.65. It appears Dell agrees with me.<p>I understand the market wasn't pricing it that way in the past few months, but I am not one who believes in efficient markets.  My intrinsic value estimate is higher than 13.65, and far higher than the surely oversold Nov price.  You are probably correct though, the price premium is probably enough to entice a majority vote.  I just feel as though it justifies a higher bid.<p><a href=""http://www.gurufocus.com/financials.php?symbol=dell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gurufocus.com/financials.php?symbol=dell</a>",1360079921

Some of that was a good thing but in general it was an over reach. C level people now signed their names and risked prosecution. The way revenue was recognized became so conservative as to be nonsensical in many cases. The costs layered on to manage this became significant. In short, it became more and more difficult to innovate if you were a public company due to the costs and potential backlash from public markets.<p>Facebook is a victim of this on one end. They delayed their IPO as long as they could as Zuckerberg loathed what having to please outside investors would do to the nimbleness he requires. They then waited too long and so are now trying to excite the markets with a company that's already past its most exciting part of the growth curb. Add to that obvious greed and ego in terms of pricing as high as possible and you have a huge web blanket thrown on the ability for other tech companies to IPO.<p>Dell is on the other end. They decided it was better to invest 6 months of their lives into going private so that they too could innovate for the longer term.<p>At the end of the day we've gone from the go-go days of the 90's where nearly any tech company would IPO to a point where very few IPO either because they can't or don't want to. That will fundamentally change how companies are funded going forward and will likely impact the amount of returns being generated at the critical (for VC's) end of the funnel.

But a decent add responding to the unpredictable,

5171193,comment,5170424,5170834,17,0,ot,,,"I sense some sarcasm :) Luckily these things have nice geometrical
interpretations, let me try to clarify this better, hoping that I can
stimulate some curiosity on the subject.<p>Imagine a <i>linear</i> transformation in the 3-dimensional space; that
means that rotations, ""flips"", and scalings are allowed. For example
take a rotation: points that are in the axis of rotation remain on
that line. Likewise, think of the plane <i>orthogonal</i> to the axis of
rotation, then points that are on that plane rotate, but they stay on
that plane. The axis of rotation and its orthogonal plane are both
<i>invariant subspaces</i>.<p>In a 3-dimensional space, and in general in every odd-dimensional
space, every linear transformation has an invariant subspace. This is
not true for even-dimensional spaces, such as the 2d plane: a
45-degree rotation for example has no invariant subspace (except for {0}
and the whole space, of course). However, if you allow the coordinates
to be <i>complex numbers</i>, instead of real, then there always is an
invariant subspace, although it is harder to visualize.<p>To express this in linear algebra terms, every complex matrix has an
eigenvector. This is a fundamental fact that has applications pretty
much everywhere in mathematics.<p>The Invariant Subspace problem generalizes this statement to spaces
that are infinite-dimensional. Infinite-dimensional spaces are
infinitely messy, so we restrict our attention to spaces that have
some additional structure; for example Hilbert spaces, those addressed
in the paper, are those where a formula very similar to the
Pythagorean theorem is true.",1360078954

It's hard doing this kind of thing in a vacuum, and this is a great start.<p>From my perspective, the inventory management piece needs some work.  Think about it this way - you get a half dozen boxes in with four different styles of shirts in three colors and four sizes.  What's the fastest way to get this information into inventory?  Example: the long-sleeve shirt with piping arrives in two colors - in green you receive 1xs, 2s, 4m, 4l, 2xl, and in blue you receive 2xs, 3s, 3m, 3L, 1xl.  Styles are rarely available for more than a season, so this is a process that is repeated again and again and again.  Customers will also want to be able to track product cost, associate products with a vendor, and enter the vendor's sku. Otherwise, it's ""We need to reorder those pink shirts.  Where did we get those?""<p>I'd ditch the customer photo.  It looks nice in the demo, but I don't really follow why an ecommerce customer would provide a photo.  It also makes the rows on the Customers page really tall, which means that you get many fewer customers on a page.  The same goes for the products page in the control panel - I'd keep the photos, but reduce the thumbnail size.<p>On the Products page, I'd want to be able to sort by sales for a given time period.  I'd want to know which products are selling well, and which aren't.<p>Finally, I didn't see any shipping settings (apologies if I missed them)?  You'll need to be able to calculate shipping cost for a given shipping provider (FedEx, UPS, USPS, etc) from the point of origin to the customer.  Shipping costs are pretty much what makes or breaks an online retail company.  Ideally, you'd allow for more than one carrier, since small/light items are usually much cheaper to ship via USPS.",1360078882

To take just one example, in physics or engineering, the sorts of admissions climate scientists have made about losing raw data, not archiving it properly, not properly recording the manipulations they've made to the data, etc., would be grounds for dismissal of the people involved and repudiation of all of their conclusions. The work would have to be re-done from scratch using proper procedures.""<p>You act as if there has ever been a targeted attack on the entire scientific community of physics and engineering, like there has been on the climate science community.  There has not been, so therefore there isn't some single record of all of the errors and bad data in these scientific communities.  When you talk of mistakes made by ""climate scientist"" with ther data, what percentage of climate scientists do you think have committed these errors?  You are using mistakes made by individuals and organizations to smear an entire science.  This is both erroneous, dishonest, and false, and is the scientific equivalent of ""Asians are bad drivers because I got rear ended by this guy.""  
Proving climate science right, compared to proving physics/engineering is comparing apples and oranges.  Unless you know of a duplicate earth-like planet to use as a control group while we proceed with binding formerly buried carbon molecules with atmospheric oxygen in our current planet to see what happens.
Instead, they are left with computer simulations, which have, so far, been too consevative to be accurate.  They have failed to take into account all of the positive feedback loops, and the result is that the planet is warmer than predicted.  These simulations are then challenged and attacked, other variables such as solar output variation, etc are mentioned, and the science is dismissed as being phoney, biased, cherry picking.<p>I don't even beleive carbon reduction is viable.  I want geo-engineering solutions to handle the problem.

If you pay for a ""scout"" account you can view and contact designers who you think fit the bill. You can also filter by city/location.<p>The best way to go about this is to hop on dribbble and search for products similar to yours. For example, if you have an enterprise SaaS platform, search for ""dashboard"", ""enterprise"", etc. If you're more social leaning, search ""social"", ""twitter"", etc.<p>2. When you talk to designers, be clear on the scope of your project. Let them know the exact scope of the project. Ask is they have any UX experience. You don't need a UX pro, but you also don't need a designer who can only design visuals and abandon your workflows.<p>3. Good freelance designers will charge you around $85~$100+ per hour in the NYC Area. Yes you can find cheaper ($40-60), but the price usually correlates to experience. Keep in mind freelance designers (and especially those with front-end skills) prefer to take their normal hourly rate and double it to foot Uncle Sam his bill at the end of the year! Rates outside of NYC will be cheaper, but of course in high-tech areas such as SF, it will be more or less the same if not higher.",1360077808

So freeing the memory would be an error itself. This is me being a bit pedantic, but it is important to note that the error condition for resource allocation is generally ""there is nothing from this step to deallocate"". This can turn into an ""off by one"" error in cleanup if you aren't careful.<p>Second, say your allocate_memory is successful... your next n steps look like:<p><pre><code>   if (allocate_memory() != OK) { return error;}
   if (allocate_resource1() !=OK { free_mem(); return error;}
   if (allocate_resource2() !=OK { free_r1(); free_mem();}
   ....
   if (allocate_resourceN() !=OK { free_N-1();...;free_r2(); free_r1(); free_mem(); return error;}
   // .... CODE
   free_N();
   free_N-1();
   ...
   free_r2();
   free_r1();
   free_mem();
   return success;
</code></pre>
There are two things to note here. First of all, the if lines get very long when you have to do all that unwinding at the loop. This is ugly and annoying, but itself not a problem. Second, and this is a code smell, you've gone and seriously repeated yourself. Now every time you add a resource allocation, you have to update the unwinding in several places. There is more room for error, more chance of subtle issues in order creeping in. etc. This pattern is a way to avoid it.<p>The author addresses doing the whole chain in nested ifs in the original article.",1360077385

It's really interesting how currency can manifest itself without a regulated system.<p>The main point of my article (I think my poor writing didn't help me convey the message) is that even when we move on to electronic money (like bitcoin) people will still not want to carry them (having their own wallets at home), they will prefer a bank or service to take care of this. I think this is great because we could start using bitcoins with systems that are already in place, I even built a small demo for Verifone PoS which integrated nicely with our current systems (I run a credit card company)<p>Sometimes I also think that electronic money, like credit cards, could not be as democratic as paper.",1360077236

5170996,comment,5156413,5170314,1,0,padseeker,,,"There is a very logical reason why I asked the question and mentioned Django, not all of which was spelled out in my post;<p>1. I want to use a widely supported framework, and Django seems to be the most likely candidate. There are a lot of things I like about Rails, but perhaps the best thing about it is there are so many gems/plugins that make extending an application very easy.<p>2. I have already updated my app so it is running the latest (and patched) version of Rails. The problem is in the article by Patrick Mackenzie (see here - <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/01/31/what-the-rails-security-issue-means-for-your-startup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/01/31/what-the-rails-security-...</a>) it seemed to indicate there are a lot more gotchas in Rails that will emerge as time goes by which is very concerning.<p>The couple of things I don't like about Rails is deployment and too much magic. In light of the security issue if there are that many potential issues with YAML then I wanted to know if Django was measurably more secure as well as easier to deploy, and if it had less magic. Perhaps I should have spelled those things out.<p>One more thing - I found your comment about Django Unchained comment rather snarky and a little insulting. It's as if the the security problems in Rails (2 of them found in the past month and more to come apparently) gives me a chance to change my framework as if it were like a fasion trend. There are a lot of moving parts in rails and I don't understand all of it, I've never read the source code. I've already invested quite a bit in learning Rails but now I am at a cross roads, do I go full monty and learn all the ins and outs of Ruby, or do I consider looking elsewhere.<p>Your post definitely has a condescending tone and I did not appreciate it.

They made some bold moves on UX, and I was surprised I was agreeing with them. There's a tiling wm extension, shellshape, that has advantages over awesome (!). I'm happy with the move. This is just to say that gnome is not targeting grandmas and teenager with their redesign. If you were used to gnome 2 desktop (which I hated) give 3 a serious try.",1360076712

But it doesn't take much reading on tech forums (yes, even HN) to see that some questions, like ""Which is the best programming paradigm"" are really battlegrounds for religious wars.  As engineers our goal should always be to use the best tool for the job, but without a defined ""job"", we retreat to personal preference and experience.<p>I think there are various alternatives to try to mitigate voting being a popularity contest.  One is to remove any claim of the question being about the ""best, given no context"".  The question might be better phrased as ""Which Raspberry PI OS is right for me?"", where the ""me"" is defined by the reader.  Then the quality of the answer would be determined by whether in the answer, it qualifies the assumptions.  Something like: ""Premise: You want to control small hobbyist mechanical and electrical systems using the onboard GPIO"" and ""Premise: You want to use the PI for media sharing.""<p>Another option is to abandon a simple upvote system in favor of qualified thumbs-up.  Like ""This answer is  Clear,  Insightful,  Accurate"".  Unfortunately that wreaks havoc on your pretty charts, unless you find a way of unifying those votes into a single score.

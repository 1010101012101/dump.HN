I haven't read more than the description page yet, so i don't know if it's possible either, but I think that if it is possible then that would be a great way to iteratively test production.  I also wonder if it will be possible to play against your bot early on.  They mention in the description that they'll have top players playing the bots at the tournaments, but I wonder if it's easy to get that set up at home.  I should think so, but you never know.  If it is easy it would be rather fun to play your own bot.",1258059584

My father decided he'd rather stay in a relatively low chemical engineering job rather than push up the corporate latter into a black tie management position.  As a result my friends all had much nicer toys and bigger houses, but they rarely saw their parents.  On top of that my friend's parents never seemed happy, ever.  Whereas my father has always been one of the happiest people I know.  Throughout my highschool years he'd tell me stories almost nightly of something interesting he'd done that day.  Now that I'm older and nearing the end of my own degree I have no doubt I'll keep the same perspective: stick with doing what you love no matter how much you make off of it.<p>- I should clarify that we didn't live anywhere near poverty.  My father wasn't putting us in a bad situation to keep the job he loved.  We were just significantly lower than the people around us, and as a result he didn't have many friends among his peers (by that I mean parents in our suburb) because they looked down on him.

Many Chinese Communists were former members of the Kuomintang and their similarities weren't just superficial; they both learned their bag of tricks--propaganda, how to organize their party-state-military structure, how to suppress dissent, how to control the larger population--from the Soviets.  To this very day, Taiwan still has political military officers stationed at all public high schools and colleges (though thankfully their role has changed a lot).  If Taiwan was showing China anything, it was that they could keep around the party and the authoritarianism and open up their markets at the same time.  As you are well-aware, martial law wasn't lifted until 1987 and Taiwan wasn't even really anything you could even nominally call democracy until the 90s.<p>So basically 1) Taiwan was still Leninist and 2) I don't get what the Democracy Wall writers are inspired by when Taiwan wasn't a democracy then.<p>Ironically, one foundation for economic prosperity in Taiwan was the land reform the Kuomintang copied--although they would not admit it--from the Communists and implemented after they occupied Taiwan after World War II.  They forced all the big landlords at gunpoint to trade in their land for largely worthless stock in state-owned companies.  Prior to that, much of the population were landless tenant farmers.  The possibilities for entrepreneurship change quite a bit when you go from being a tenant farmer to a small time farmer with your own land.",1258057189

Not so much the pieces themselves but a situation described. Your post is full of frustration and dread. The accumulation of energy before a lightning strike. I would love to convey this too you as the energy in your post makes me feel like you might be closer to a solution than you think. My attempt:<p>A bit of critique (not criticism mind you) - look at the 2 questions in the 2nd to last paragraph.<p>The contrast in the questions made me think of a mistake endemic to our time - one that great and small minds make. A movement from the concrete to the abstract. A movement from within to without. What Blake refers to as a 'roofed horror'<p>The question:<p>""Where should I turn..."" reminded me of the first piece of literature- have you read any DesCartes? If you are interested in the History of Science read his early life and an event known as the dream in the 'poele'. The same question occurred to him (in Latin).<p>The next question ""And what would you do?"" is a detour.<p>A natural one because the way seems blind and a deadend. And this (HN) is a community of people who likely understand where this question is coming from better than most. But the answer is not here or anywhere external.<p>Looking at your brief eloquent post this is a point at which you probably have to turn within.<p>The last paragraph is abstract where the previous ones are personal and direct. And of course it is a valid answer but the impetus is reactive and negative. By negative I do not mean 'wrong' or misguided. I mean in the sense that it is defined as against something else. The ""something new"" that is NOT your current life and does NOT involve yr difficult boss.<p>But to break free in a meaningful way this has to be transcended. 2nd piece of literature - the introduction to Hegel's ""Phaenomenology of Geist"". Negation is a moment in the process. Acorn --> tree. Lightning revealing a crumbling structure at the moment of its collapse.<p>And 3rd TS Eliot's WasteLand. Part 3 or 4. ""What the thunder said"". Images from an Sanskrit text. World in a drought, groups of people gather and pray to discover the reasons for the drought. A terrific thunderclap which each group hears as a different word. That word is a key.<p>Hopefully this does not sound too hokey.<p>I wish you the best.",1258056102

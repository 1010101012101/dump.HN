First of all everything is personalized - and not just by tweaking some settings or selecting your favorite tags, but in a machine learning way - the system tries to guess what you will like and acts accordingly. It uses implicit feedback too, so it tracks your clicks and tries to learn from it, but you can always see how it learned and what it thinks about you in the sliders.",1204610363

Most financial sites, brokerage houses, banks and many more websites run with java.<p>Just b.c you hear about rails or django all the damn time, doesn't mean they are widely used.  They are just trendy frameworks.<p>(Php is the other language that run the rest of the web.).",1204610063

I think it is an intriguing idea but I don't think it will work because tagging cannot capture enough information about a particular web page. Personally I didn't find it to be very useful, but I was wondering what other people's opinions are.",1204609351

It's entirely conceivable that he would have done so even if people hadn't said harsh things about him on blogs.<p>Something about the phrase ""driven to suicide"" bothers me. It reduces the element of choice involved. Even if someone left a suicide note saying ""Trolls made me do it,"" it wouldn't make it true.",1204608398

With commodity servers and free operating systems what are they going to sell?

128617,comment,128128,128236,0,0,xirium,,,"Robert X. Cringely has been harsh to Sun over the years:<p>Sun did not invent the engineering workstation, but they certainly perfected it. But where are workstations today? Gone, for the most part. Sun's workstation business is about the same size as SGI's, which is to say small. Sun is now a server company, but that won't last long either under the onslaught of Linux. Cheap Intel and AMD hardware running Linux is going to kill Sun unless the company does something so stop it, which they aren't. -- <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2003/pulpit_20030213_000762.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2003/pulpit_20030213_0007...</a><p>A lot of this comes down to how companies view themselves and what they are really good at. You'll notice, for example, that I didn't include Sun in my list of vital companies. That's not so much because Sun can be defined in terms of the others but that Sun is simply doomed. Their software isn't better, their hardware isn't better, and they can't see themselves as anything but a maker of hardware or software, so my simple recommendation is that they take the rest of their cash and try entering a hot new field like -- say -- space flight. Or making really fine cakes. The world will always need fine baked goods. Or just give it back to the shareholders. Really. -- <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2006/pulpit_20060504_000895.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2006/pulpit_20060504_0008...</a><p>Remember my doom-and-gloom prediction last week for Sun Microsystems? That's based almost entirely on the company's inability to see itself moving from being vertically integrated (doing its own proprietary hardware and software) to competing on a level (that is horizontal) playing field. While that might make them just another PC vendor, don't worry about that happening because Sun would rather die first. And will. -- <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2006/pulpit_20060511_000896.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2006/pulpit_20060511_0008...</a><p>If he's right then it will be interesting to see the details unfold.

They got bought by the big publisher and eventually the wheels came off.  Good pay, great royalties, but I like the broke-ass startup life better.",1189064522

Large corporations are about as likely to take your idea and run with it as an Aircraft carrier doing a 180.<p>Why?  Momentum.<p>Momentum means ability to take a new idea on, think about it and execute. It also means being able to communicate the idea to <i>Learned leaders</i> then asking permission. So by the time it gets there your most likely to get someone with a <i>business degree</i> [0] making a snap decision on some hypothetical tech idea.  The other thing is most large corporations area of expertise is probably not hacking (MS, IBM, SAP all have hackers but management is still the problem).<p>Also telling someone about an idea is pretty lame because ideas are worth, well nothing. But a demonstration of and idea that works? Demonstrating something will spur others to do something ... maybe throw large offers your way.<p>I did read a post here some time ago of someone mentioning an idea (to a trusted friend) who then created a coy, hired outsourced coders. So demo first, shout second. Shout loud.<p>[0] Phil Greenspun mentions this in FOW, Ch24, P238 where the head of Wal-Mart, Kevin  Turner had but one business degree. This doesn't mean he's not smart but it takes years to train in tech. Is one general are of expertise enough?",1189064217

Wow.<p>He also thinks its the poor people's fault for taking sweet deals that were offered to them? If you look at it from an economic perspective, all they had to lose was the property on which they took out the loan and a bad credit rating, but their credit rating sucked already anyway. (Granted, this may have emotional consequences as they foreclose and have to move out, but that doesn't really impact the economics of it.) In contrast, the lenders are losing their investment! Isn't it the responsibility of the lenders to invest in, uhm, sensible investments?<p>OK, I should stop bitching about this troll's obvious flamebait.<p>[EDIT: after reading the rest of the piece, I see that this is satire. he sure got my blood boiling as I read it.]",1189062723

50989,comment,50436,50981,0,0,thingsilearned,,,"I'm wrong.  I upped your points because it was funny and I know you.  Doing it for YC points is just the most shallow pathetic and pointless reason which sometimes seems like THE reasons because it makes the other reasons seem like niceties or excuses.  <p>I don't think we are our worst thoughts.  Sure guys think about sex every 3 minutes but we're not a bunch of women clubbing apes. We respect the people we're with and we care about their interests.  We treat them as such. <p>I think honesty in relationships is hugely key, but only constructive honesty.  Telling someone only what they want to hear is doing them a disservice.  But scratching every itch that comes into your head is equally unhelpful.  Criticism is something that needs to be thought out and analyzed before handed out (or received).  In my experience initial critical instincts often tend to be based on societal norms, prejudice or other forms of unoriginal thought.",1189062110
50988,comment,50853,50928,0,0,neilc,,,"Well, there would still be a basis for <i>some</i> interest, because the lender could make more money on their capital by using it for another purpose, such as buying T-bills or some other security with essentially zero risk. Intuitively I'd think that part of the interest charged on a loan is literally just to ""rent the money"", preventing it from being used for another purpose; the rest is to account for the possibility that the loan might not be repaid.",1189062042

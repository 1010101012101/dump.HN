633696,comment,633120,633266,0,0,telegraph,,,"I have to respectfully disagree with you. It's true that there is a large group of kids who would be better served if their teachers focused more on applications; however, I think that there's an equally large (if not bigger) group of students for whom learning about applications is not helpful. When I was in public school, my teachers always made an effort to highlight how the math we were learning could be applied to real world problem -- the end result was that often the struggling students would say ""You use this to build rocket ships? Well I'm NEVER going to do that... I give up.""<p>The most important thing we can do is change our attitude. It's hard to develop an interest in something that you find difficult when you're receiving mixed messages from all of the adults in your life; when adults will demand you get better grades all while telling you it's okay because ""math is for nerds"" or ""not everyone can do math.""<p>I did well (good grades, but it's not like I was Terence Tao or anything) in math in school, and my teachers in other subjects, my coaches, my friends' parents, etc, acted like I was a freak because of it. You can't give a high five with one hand while you're pointing and laughing with the other. This is the attitude that must change before we can raise a generation who take pride in developing math skills.",1243695533

The cheap offices are usually larger office spaces split up. I.e. close quarters. It's the neighbors you need to worry about, not the landlord.<p>Keep in mind that a net connection is also more expensive at an office, you'll need a gym membership in order to take a shower, eat out every meal, regular chiropractor visits, psychotherapy sessions, etc. If you add it all up you probably won't be saving any money.",1243695346

Recent estimates have been more conservative. According to a study from the University of Wales Swansea, after taking into accounts the costs of acquiring a degree (foregone earnings and tuition costs), male graduates can expect to see their lifetime earnings (net of taxes) increased by £141,539 over similar men who finished their education with two or more A-levels. The corresponding figure for women is £157,982, reinforcing the findings from other studies that women benefit even more than their male counterpart from a university education.<p>...<p>The financial benefits of a degree are, perhaps unsurprisingly, subject dependent. Maths and computing degrees were found to offer the greatest increase in lifetime earnings for male graduates, whilst a degree in education represents the highest returns for women. The Swansea report concluded that the cost of gaining a degree is far less than the potential increase in lifetime earnings for the majority of graduates.<p>Unattributed - you can Google:<p>""Both graduates and non graduates who took Maths A-level ended up earning on average 10 percent more than those of similar ability and background who did not""<p>There's lots more if you look for it. The consensus is that having a qualification in mathematics has a measurable impact on your earnings.",1243695264

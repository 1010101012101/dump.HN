NZ is able to get drugs cheap because the US consumers are paying extremely high prices which cover the development costs. If everyone was buying drugs at the price we pay in NZ, there would be far less incentive to develop new drugs.<p>With NZ being such a small market we can get away with it without having any impact on the development of drugs, but we&#x27;re lucky that the Americans are picking up the development tab for us and we would have a problem if they stopped doing that.",1433321984

It seems to encompass all levels of Russian society, especially the poorer people who are cut off from anything but the state TV, but also the middle classes.

It looks nice, I can definitely see the utility in have a simple object model for transferring information between processes. In nix land you get pretty good at extracting data from simple text forms, though sometimes it&#x27;s harder than it should be.<p>One thing that jumped out at me there is the overhead of the commands.<p><pre><code>    430ms: ls | where {$_.Name -like &quot;*.exe&quot;}\n    140ms: ls *.exe\n    27ms : ls -Filter &quot;*.exe&quot;.\n</code></pre>\nNot so much the absolute numbers but the fact that there are 3 different ways of doing it and the more flexible choice is over a magnitude slower.<p>What happens when you add another command to the pipeline? Do they buffer the streams like in linux?<p>I guess the situation will improve over time but how complete is the eco-system at the moment? One area nixes will always shine is the total ubiquity. Everything can be done over commands and everything works with text.<p>[0] <a href=""https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/powershell-101-from-a-linux-guy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/powershell-101-from-a-l...</a>",1433320643

This is why most people get assigned a computer by their places of employment, and are not expected to use their own. The place of work has their own tech team who deal with these types of issues. It&#x27;s a really bad idea to do work stuff on a home computer because it makes your device much more vulnerable to being snooped on and controlled (for example, your place of employment may gain the ability to remotely wipe your device), and generally if you are in such a pickle then you should just not give them your password.<p>Again, it could be a <i>software issue</i>. If I complain that my WiFi isn&#x27;t working, and you take it in to have a look, and your diagnostics say that WiFi works, then without the password you can&#x27;t do anything at all.

Prominently visible personalities can attach their PGP keys to their pages and make the first association harder to forge.<p>Secondly, I have little doubt that the keyservers are monitored. An increase of searches and/or downloads to known activist lawyers&#x27; or journalists&#x27; keys could have relation to uncomfortable whistles being blown in near future.

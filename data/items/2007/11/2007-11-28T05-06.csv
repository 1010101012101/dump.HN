The problem is that mice have a two to three-year lifespan and several orders of magnitude fewer cells than a human. So cancer in mice is very, very different from cancer in humans. Mice don't even <i>get</i> the kind of cancer that concerns us -- the kind that develops after dozens of years, and that can evade a human's anti-cancer mechanisms (which are  more powerful than those in mice, because protecting humans from cancer is a much harder task!)<p>",1196228549

84135,comment,84068,84127,0,0,mxh,,,"""there is not even the feeling that skill is involved""<p>Well, the 'skill' in BJ is pretty thin, it's thinner in craps, almost nonexistent in roulette (if I recall correctly, all bets are equivalent in EV, except for one, which is worse), and completely absent in lotteries and numbers.  And that's not to mention ""Casino War"".  People will create their own feeling of skill based on magical thinking.  After all, none of those games seem to be lacking for players.<p>I think this is brilliant; forex outcomes are basically random (yes, they are - if you could predict them, you'd be too busy counting your yachts to be here) so this system uses them as a RNG for games of chance.<p>Which people love.  Wish I'd thought of it.

It's part of ""the complicated patchwork of ideas invented between 1920 and 1926"". (The equation was published in 1926.) Teaching the Schroedinger equation first <i>is</i> the historical approach.<p>Consider this sentence from Wikipedia:<p>""The Schroedinger equation defines the behaviour of \psi\;, but does not interpret what \psi\; is. Schroedinger tried unsuccessfully to interpret it as a charge density. In 1926 Max Born, just a few days after Schroedinger's fourth and final paper was published, successfully interpreted \psi\; as a probability amplitude, although Schroedinger was never reconciled to this statistical or probabilistic approach.""<p>What this tells us is that Schroedinger's equation was a hack. It gave Erwin the right answer, but he didn't know what it meant. And, lo and behold, when I learned quantum mechanics in school I didn't know what the equation meant, either -- I was so busy trying to solve the differential equation, and learning about the relationship between the quantum Hamiltonian and the classical Hamiltonian, and looking up complicated Bessel functions, and being confused by angular momentum quantum numbers that I never really understood what the hell the wave function actually represented. <p>Aaronson's point is that we now know that quantum mechanics is about probability theory. Once you understand that -- complete with bras, kets, state vectors and matrices -- you are better equipped to understand the Schroedinger equation as one particular application of quantum theory.<p>I wish I'd known this guy back when I was a first-year physics grad student.<p>",1196227186

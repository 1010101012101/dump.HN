However, its ok because they aren&#x27;t part of the language core, just escape hatches on expressiveness :)<p>&quot;Declarative&quot; always exists in a spectrum: one&#x27;s specification is another&#x27;s implementation. It used to be that Fortran was &quot;declarative&quot; because you no longer had to write machine code and schedule instructions by hand! In truth, it is about how many, not just the kind, details can be omitted.

You institute a contract between some provider of a declarative framework (that allows you to specify intents) and the consumer of said framework (who is supposed not to poke around in any state that the framework works on).<p>I.e. state is seen in functional programming as undocumented API calls in imperative programming.

2192619,comment,2192425,2192425,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The author of this piece is right, very few people seem to comprehend how well established our trade was at the time. The silk road was well established between Rome and China at the time that Genghis Khan started his rise, to the point that it was his desire to capture it to tax it.<p>They had two major technological innovations #1 was advanced horsemanship, #2 was the composite bow. They also had one major advancement in strategy derived from their nomadic traditions - they knew how to hunt and how to do it effectively. These modified their warfare tactics massively. For instance the Mongols heavily favoured the tactic of attacking a vast swathe of outlying villages and driving the populace toward the city they intended to siege. This meant that the food stocks lasted very little time. They also knew how to breach a castle by fooling the defender (they frequently attacked the gate and fled, only to strike again), and more importantly they understood that a hunted animal fights harder when it's trapped so they never encircled their enemy, they always surrounded them in a crescent shape (IIRC it was noted that the panic to escape often resulted in people being trampled to death) to allow the people to escape. Once broken the Mongols simply followed on horseback and picked their enemy off.<p>Khan has a shrewd warrior and anything he could use to help a siege he acquired. They had catapults and ballista, but it was the Mongols who figured out that the gunpowder of the Chinese combined with the metalurgy from the European bell makers (yes bronze church bells) could be used to make a cannon... so they built cannons. Genghis Khan established the worlds (first?) best postal service for the time, to the degree of efficiency that likely still put us to shame shortly before the invention of the car. This was literally the internet of their day, especially as Khan recruited every technologist his forces encountered.<p>This is why the barbarian invasions were so powerful against the Romans and the ancient world, because they were fighting a civilization that had exclusively predatory behaviour against city-states. One of their favourite tactics was to divert a river to flood the city. Then it was just a matter of time for the water to stagnate and infection and disease to go wild, even though it rarely got to that point.",1297166391
2192617,comment,2189121,2192125,0,0,seosamhoc,,,"Firstly I said nothing of ""complete overhaul"", core changes are for example, the internet moving to IPv6, OSes moving from 32-bit to 64-bit.<p>Anything that is constantly updated with anything more than bug-fixes will become ""a pile of unmaintainable crap"", or just obsolete if the core isn't changed. Core changes normally happen before that point though. That is if business managers' incentives aren't all wrong. An example of that fairly recently was twitteriffic for iOS, they felt it was heading towards being a pile of crap so they had to stop and go back to the core.(even though it meant unhappy current customers)<p>Users not caring about it unless it immediately comes with new features or at least all the old features is exactly my point! And if what the user is paying for is updates they are absolutely not going to accept losing any features(and not going to be happy with not updating since that is the whole reason that they are paying in your method). If the user owns a version and sees that the next version doesn't have features they need they'll stick with the old version until the new version has those features. In your model they have already paid for that update.<p>""So a feature that might only add a small marginal cost but would make current users happy""
Prices aren't just based on costs, they are usually(in the IT sector) based on how much more they ""make users happy"", in some cases they are almost entirely based on that, clothes, shoes and apple products being the most obvious examples. Which to repeat in another way is the problem with core updates in your system, they are high ""cost"" but they only prevent the programme from going to shit so they don't ""make current users happy""(just prevent future unhappiness).<p>That's not to say that your model doesn't work in some cases, anti-virus programmes need constant updates but very seldom core changes.(although oddly enough at least for norton it's much cheaper to buy the newer version in amazon or a shop and get continued subscription that way then to update a subscription) And you mentioned GPS apps the same applies to them, no core changes needed.
Angry Birds on iOS is absolutely not a case of it though, you don't pay for new levels, new levels are free and are an example of the opposite of what you're saying happening, you pay upfront and they have continued adding levels way beyond a point where it would have been reasonable for them to make an Angry Birds 2 and putting the new levels in that. It is a special case but it is the traditional model just with a new attitude (on iOS, on android it's the ad revenue model which is different again).",1297166295

2192611,comment,2191996,2192594,0,0,fnl,,,"Quite on the contrary; I work in data mining and need to count characters on many different occasions. Probably for web development you don't need to care about that stuff, right (but read the second paragraph first!). So if character counting is not important in your app, you can naturally use whatever you want. If it is, however, UTF-16 is far more efficient, while not having to waste space with UTF-32 if you can be quite sure that the Supp. Range can be safely ignored or by adding a trivial safeguard.<p>And the ""ASCII argument"" is quite antiquated, almost all (scientific) char data I have contains non-ASCII characters, especially greek letters and such.

The company paid them to test me on my programming and personal skills, I took the tests, and the company got the results.  (The company then gave me a copy of the results.)<p>Before the BB test, the other guy they were interviewing practically had the job.  His resume looked much better than mine.  But after the test, they said it was exactly the opposite.<p>The company eventually stopped using BB, probably because it was too expensive to give to every candidate.  (I'm guessing at the reason.  I never knew the prices.)<p>I recently had a job interview that had a pre-test that consisted of a simple CRUD application you have to built from scratch, to spec, and a puzzle.  The puzzle was simply explaining how you'd write code to solve a scenario which happened to be a modified Traveling Salesman puzzle.  The changes were just to make it a lot easier.<p>The CRUD app just showed that you can follow spec and actually deliver working code.  Also, you can write instructions on any deployment steps needed.<p>The puzzle showed a few things, too.  You can understand complex issues.  You can reason out a solution without code.  You can explain that solution to others clearly.<p>All that was before the interview, making sure they only interviewed people who were up to snuff!<p>I actually got hired at another company before I went to that interview, but I was hoping they would use the interview to go over some of the code and puzzle and ask why things were done that way as a final check that you really wrote it, and that you can explain verbally as well.

If you ensure there are no Surrogate Chars (which is a simple byte-mask comparison using every second byte  (only!) as in: ""0xD800 & byte == 0xD800"" [using the entire range to avoid having to think about byte order]) in your array, you can be 100% sure about the character length just by dividing the byte-length in two. With UTF-8, you have to look at each and every byte one by one and count the number of characters to establish the actual char-length. Finally, given how rare the Supplementary Range characters are, the Surrogate Range check can be safely skipped in many scenarios, making it significantly faster to establish char lengths in UTF-16 than UTF-8.<p>EDIT: oh, and before any ""semantic-nerd"" comes along: I am fully aware that 0xXXXX are two bytes, so, if you want, read ""two-byte"" for every time I mention ""byte"" above...

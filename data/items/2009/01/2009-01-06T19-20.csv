422359,comment,422225,422225,0,0,mdasen,,,"The reason is that you don't have to deal with it.  Amazon isn't magic and they use the same hardware available to everyone else.  Sure, there's some scale involved when it comes to labor and power and bandwidth, but they can't undercut what you can do yourself.<p>However, spraying files everywhere is a pain!  MogileFS makes it a lot better, but you're still in charge of monitoring it and making sure it's healthy.  With only two boxes, you have to be always on call so that you can order another box from your provider fast.<p>Plus, there's the issue of multiple data centers.  S3 doesn't just make redundant copies of your data.  It makes copies across data centers.  So, you're paying $0.10/GB for data in, but you don't have to pay for when it replicates copies into several data centers.<p>You also have to realize that you have to pay for excess capacity anytime you're doing your own storage system.  If you like to keep a 50% buffer (a reasonable size), you're going to be paying 1.5x the base cost of $0.10/GB that you've come up with.<p>And then there's the issue of having to make sure you're monitoring it and that if you see a spike in storage usage you can add drives fast enough. . .<p>You pay for a bit of convenience with S3.  I'm not going to argue that it's cheaper, but it's definitely a lot less headache.  Are you going to colo several boxes in different data centers, constantly monitor the storage, make sure that they serve the files properly, making sure that more copies get replicated if one server dies, replace drives as they fail, adding more servers as needed. . .<p>If you're on a large scale, I'd say you should do your own storage because you can justify making that someone's job (or a large enough portion of their job).  I'm not sure I agree with SmugMug using S3, but I'm not sure I disagree either - it allows them to concentrate on what they want to do.  Remember, for every tech person on HN, there's 100 that will say they're doing backups and aren't (ok, maybe not true, but you have to find an employee to manage your storage who you trust as much as Amazon).<p>However, most people don't have that much to store.  If you're storing 100GB of data, you'd then be paying for multiple servers all with RAID and managing MogileFS or the like for what?  20% savings?  $150/year?  I'm as cheap as the next person, but I also like sleep.  I don't want a pager calling me telling me that one of my two file stores is down and that I need to provision and configure a new box at 2am.  And do you want to focus your time on creating a compelling product that your customers think is awesome or do you want to spend your time creating an awesome file store that works really well?  Life has tradeoffs.  You're not wrong, but I don't see Amazon as ripping people off with their pricing and I don't mind someone profiting from giving me a hassle-free, no-lock-in solution.<p>EDIT: I personally think your estimate of buying boxes and colo'ing them is a tad low so my 20% might be your 50% and so it might make sense by your numbers more.  Maybe I've just seen crappy colo offers.  Link if you know good ones!  I love being proved wrong.",1231271263

422349,comment,422225,422225,0,0,barryrandall,,,"The problem is that storage costs are a step function. Once you cross a certain threshold (the threshold depends on your performance requirements a.k.a. IOPS), storage gets Really Freaking Expensive (tm). The steps start to get really, really steep as your capacity increases, and that's just for the primary copy of your data.<p>Once you get into truly large data amounts, other things start to break (RAID 5, RAID 6, tape backup, disk backup, synchronization, the ability to replace storage systems without massive outages). The good news is that they're almost all solved problems, but you're usually stuck with buying overpriced crap from EMC, Hitachi, NetApp, 3PAR and IBM (storage is a protection racket).  All of this combines to explain why a good storage admin pulls down 6 figures a year.<p>I may be a bit myopic, but I see a world coming where technology startups trade capital costs for operating costs. S3 is pricey if you're dealing with small quantities of data, but once the step increase in your per-GB storage costs goes over 30%, you might want to reconsider.

422314,comment,421900,421900,0,0,jonasvp,,,"Obviously, not everything is a Ponzi scheme but the point the article is making is totally valid. Any child can understand that you cannot grow indefinitely in a confined space, even if that space is the Earth and even if the value measured is quality. The measure of quality is appreciation and we only have a limited amount of time on our hands.<p>I wonder why so few people think about the following line of reasoning:<p>1. Our current economy is based on money as a medium of exchange to function (separation of labor -> good)<p>2. Therefore, money is a universal medium of exchange and acquires a value separate from the exchange value: liquidity, the possibility to exchange it for anything else (see Keynes et.al) -> unintended but ok<p>3. As a consequence, our current money relies on a positive rate of interest to circulate. Whenever the interest rate gets too close to zero, money holders will not give up their privilege of liquidity and not lend out their money (bad!)<p>4. As a result, the economy collapses - simply because the medium of exchange stops circulating. In the end, the government has to print new money to replace the money not being spent/lent, leading to inflation. Alternatively, the state has to make new debts or fund dying industries only to keep interest rates positive... (very bad!)<p>This reasoning does not depend on any technology or production-based argument because every human undertaking these days is based on beating the rate of interest. Even if you only invest your own money, you have to factor in the interest you might have gotten at the bank.<p>There's a really simple fix to it: motivate money holders to part with their money even without interest. You would get an economy that <i>can</i> grow when it needs to but can contract as well without collapsing.<p>Even though it seems god-given, money itself is actually pretty hackable.

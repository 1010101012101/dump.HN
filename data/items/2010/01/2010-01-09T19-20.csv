1041904,comment,1041744,1041870,0,0,bokonist,,,"For a long time, I wanted to teach myself statistics for the social sciences too.  I decided the best way to do this was to find an interesting social science issue, and then learn statistics as part of tackling the issue.  But there was one problem with this.  There are almost no problems in the social science where it makes sense to use advanced statistics to analyze them.  Using very simple regressions can be illuminating and illustrative (though not conclusive).  But when you try to get more advanced, data quality, data coding, issues with choosing the right controls, too many variables, sensitivity to variable selection, inability to separate causation from correlation, etc. render advanced statistics utterly useless.   Do you have a particular social science problem that you think would be a good fit for statistics?",1263067151

So... take this with a huge grain of salt. :)<p>My first thought is that, you're right, these techniques are most obviously applicable when selling something. But even in the case of training, I think it might be possible to ""sell"" what you are trying to train if you focus on the ""what I'm doing"" aspect.<p>What I mean is that I've sat through a few lame corporate training presentations in my time and they always consist of loads of processes. Things like, ""do this, then this, then this, and poof - you're done!"" But what they utterly fail to actually tell you is WHAT you are doing and WHAT was accomplished! Perhaps a lame example might help...<p>Imagine being taught how to cook a burger like this: First you are told how and where to find the meat (perhaps in the freezer in the kitchen on the 3rd shelf). Then you are told or shown that you must place the meat into a special tray. Then this tray is inserted into the microwave oven and a very specific numerical sequence is entered. Wait for exactly 3 minutes. Now you remove the container from the microwave.... etc..<p>What's lost here is the end goal and the WHY. What are you really trying to make and why do these steps even exist in this order? Is there really only one single right sequence of steps?<p>So.. how does this help? Well, I imagine Steve would first give you the motivation for wanted to make your burger. Perhaps he lets you taste one. Touch it. Smell it. Study it. Compare with the ""the competition."" Now you know what your goal is. Then the process is to not follow steps, but to understand what needs to be done. You must understand that the meat must be thawed and why you can't just cook it first, then form it into a burger shape. This kind of thing.<p>So in your case, I imagine the presentation would first include real examples and problems that need to be solved and that you will learn how to solve with the program. Maybe work through one of them. Or study it so that it becomes clear as to what variables are involved and why. The second act, then, is where you connect the dots of the first part with the software. X is represented in the software here... (do a demo) Etc. The 3rd act is to tie ti all together. A complete example of a single event or something that you'd use the software for and how to get the results and what they mean and how to translate those results into real world meaning. (If it just spits out some pretty graphs - why do I even care? What does it MEAN?)<p>That sort of thing.<p>Maybe. :P<p>Now I'm hungry.",1263066831

Your belly will also be full, which cuts down on the feeling of hunger.<p>People do lose large amounts of weight on small deficits, get serious!! It just takes a while. I personally dropped nearly 40 lbs this way and large people can also certainly do this - go ask a nutritionist. Of course you were hungry all the time, your body was down regulating. You are sitting here attacking a theory immediately after admitting that you could not maintain the 500-1000 calorie deficit? That has nothing to do with the theory! You chose to eat more, you gained weight again - if you had maintained your discipline, you would not have gained the weight back.<p>I've researched the carb-free diet in detail and my conclusion is carbohydrates play an important role in human nutrition and it is very unwise to cut them out. We evolved to run off a particular type of fuel, continue with this diet for a couple more years and then consequences will become apparent. There is a wide variety of material from credible mainstream nutrition researchers on this. The healthy thing to do is to make sure your nutrients are handled in a balanced way and then slowly burn off fat and actually maintain discipline for years.

In my opinion, if there's one priority that desktop Linux should have for the coming year to increase its appeal, it's not in the OS itself; it's in working with services to get better support  compatibility.

1041850,comment,1041069,1041395,0,0,NateLawson,,,"It sounds like your understanding is a bit off. Let's keep these terms separate: composition and nonce. A composition is some fixed function, composed of multiple iterations of a smaller primitive. A nonce (or salt) is a unique value per instance, where ""instance"" in this case is a single stored hash result.<p>The BSD MD5-crypt password hash algorithm is composed of multiple MD5 iterations. However, if you look at the code, you'll see that the variation of what gets tossed into MD5 only depends on the loop counter (i). So the hash function is not data-dependent. You could unroll all the loops into a single, large function that applies MD5 repeatedly to various inputs.<p><a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libcrypt/crypt-md5.c?rev=HEAD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libcrypt/crypt...</a><p>There is a salt in MD5-crypt, but it is just input data to the function. It does not change the actual hash function that is performed.<p>Now, your question: ""is iterated MD5 of the message alone less secure than iterated MD5 of the data + a salt?"" (And a related question that I brought in above: ""is a function that itself varies based on the input data more secure than either of these?)<p>From an algorithmic perspective, there should be no difference. If you can create an MD5+ that calculates exactly the same output as MD5(MD5(data)) but always in less steps than 2*MD5, then you have broken MD5. The easy way to see this if you can create this MD5+, you can also ""roll back"" an MD5 result to some previous value, a 2nd-preimage attack.<p>From the perspective of creating a brute-force search device, there is some difference. If you use the salt to vary your function, it starts to take up more logic area. The larger the state space you create, the more RAM your device will require or the more slightly-different logic blocks. This is what Colin is doing with scrypt.

You can send arbitrary text with arbitrary encoding.
  2.  Attachments can be any type, size, or number.
  3.  Virtually any device on the planet can send and receive mail.
  4.  Everybody already has a unique ID that they've memorized.
  5.  There's a boggling amount of infrastructure already in place.
  6.  Spam filtering is quite mature, and remarkably effective.
</code></pre>
Where email falls down is that it's stupid and slow.  All intelligence is in the mail client, and email clients don't share information other than the mail itself.  A smarter mail server (like Posterous) can do some really cool stuff. Couple smarter mail clients with a smarter server and the potential is huge.<p>I love all the new communications platforms and protocols, but I wonder if there isn't some life left in good old email.",1263065314

If your performance isn't symmetrically distributed about the mean (and it probably isn't), standard deviation probably doesn't mean what you expect.<p>I <i>only</i> look at performance in 99th percentile (or sometimes, 99.9th percentile). If 99% of responses are being served in 100ms on my webapp, I'm happy. I don't care if the mean is 5ms with a 20ms standard deviation. As long as the performance at the 99th (or 99.9th) percentile meets a level of 'acceptability' that I have predetermined, I'm satisfied.

It's simply an issue of resources. To get that kind of performance, you can't use garbage collection, context switches become an issue, disk buffering even comes into play. You have to basically write a hard real-time (or pseudo real-time) app, and that level of effort isn't worth it for a consumer facing webapp. If I was writing code for a pacemaker or something (and please, dear god, no one ever let me do that) it damn sure better be hard real-time though.",1263065046

Scripts were written that would hit our server each day and collect the maximum number of points available.<p>The scripts weren’t that smart though, and there were gaps in the rewarding badges.

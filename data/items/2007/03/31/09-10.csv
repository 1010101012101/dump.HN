Grow the userbase - iterate.<p>Reality is the superior test of whther you are an entrepreneur - don't need to get Y com funding to get going...<p>See all the recent fundees: Scribd, Boso, Weebly, Buxfer: they had a product.<p>Doesn;t need to be so far down this track but having done something is better than simulating it.

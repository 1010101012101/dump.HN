It&#x27;s not that I feel an employer should be able to watch those on the clock, but the relationship with privacy changes. And when the employee is in a job which includes monitoring of, let alone policing of behaviour - absolutely monitoring is appropriate.

If it had any effect at all, a vast majority of all of their (human) resources would be devoted to fixing this, since it has one of the greatest number of votes. And that is exactly the point of frustration of most of the people commenting there. I understand the &quot;people work voluntary&quot; reasoning, but you can&#x27;t use that reason all the time.<p>A better way to fix comments is always to have a vote up/vote down system, rather than disabling it altogether.

6759168,comment,6754953,6758328,2,0,itistoday2,,,"<i>Your point is; how can you call suicide a bad or evil thing if it relieves pain and suffering in exactly the same way that the traditional definition of euthanasia does.</i><p>I very much appreciate you reaching out in such a way. It helps to know that we&#x27;re working toward \nan understanding of perspectives, instead of arguing. Thank you.<p>That is not quite my point. I do accept the possibility of a &quot;dishonorable&quot; or &quot;reckless&quot; suicide, but I suspect such cases are the exception, rather than rule, given the significant taboo suicide carries today.<p><i>My point is; suicide prevention isn&#x27;t just about demonising suicide, the act, but about helping people not get to the point where they feel/know that suicide is the only option.</i><p>Re: &quot;isn&#x27;t just about demonising suicide&quot;, the demonization of suicide is one of the key issues that I was getting at in my post. It hurts everyone involved. Family members wake up one day only to find their loved one dead all of a sudden. This happens because of said demonization. It wouldn&#x27;t happen if suicide weren&#x27;t illegal, if people weren&#x27;t locked up against their will when they say they are suicidal, etc. A suicidal person should be free to talk about killing themselves with those close to them without fear of loss of liberty, social ostracization, and chemical rape. A son, father, daughter, mother, wife, husband, should be able to speak openly with their family about wanting out. Unfortunately, it seems our society is not mature enough for such conversation, and thus suicide becomes an agony for all involved. The person who killed themselves went through extra guilt and agony, and those surviving are also left feeling guilty, indignant, upset, angry, depressed, etc.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be that way.<p>Re: &quot;not get to the point where they feel/know that suicide is the only option&quot;, I can&#x27;t comment on that without a concrete example. People get sideswiped and end up close to the edge. It can happen gradually, or very suddenly. Each situation is unique, and must be treated as such.",1384833260

I haven&#x27;t taken a macroecon or full-fledged finance class, so take my analysis with a grain of salt.<p>If I recall correctly, &quot;demand deposits&quot; are the subject of reserve requirements, not total deposits. The vast majority of deposits are subject to strict regulation and can&#x27;t be withdrawn on demand (hence the &quot;demand deposit&quot; distinction). They are, in essence, another form of credit. Not a cash equivalent.<p>If we compare demand deposits (1.1T) to securities and net loans and leases (9.63T), we get pretty close to the 10x money multiplier.<p>Because demand deposits are the only things that need to be backed by cash, the rest of the money is essentially re-invested from another institution in the system. Someone didn&#x27;t come in to the bank and put cash on the table for those deposits. Instead, they told their bank to exchange their credit with another bank.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s just a change in the ledger sheet between two parties. Simplistically referred to as &quot;created money&quot;. The Fed lets banks &quot;create&quot; this money as long as they meet certain rules. The most important being reserve requirements.<p>Getting back to comparison with bitcoin, my original statement (&quot;1000% of deposits&quot;) was perhaps an oversimplification. But it&#x27;s hard to say exactly where bitcoin fits in to a &quot;new banking order&quot;. Would it be considered money, e.g. cash equivalent? What then is used as the medium for credit exchange e.g. the other 90% of financial activity?<p>Or is it the unit of account for EVERYTHING, including credit exchange? If so, then how do parties loan money? Won&#x27;t 90% of bitcoin sit idle for very long periods of time? And does it really make sense to use a deflationary unit of account for an inherently inflationary activity (lending)?",1384832352

Although it isn&#x27;t directly related to the type of cryptography mentioned here, I&#x27;m interested in sharing it to receive feedback from fellow HN users who know more about visual cryptography. (I&#x27;m a layman when it comes to the subject.)<p>Without further ado: My friend, a nurse, told me that serious medical complications can occur because of breakdowns in communication among patients, nurses and other healthcare professionals. As information changes hands, misspellings and misinterpretations of records can seriously harm patients.<p>For example, you might have heard the story of a girl in Ohio who overdosed in 2011 because a nurse accidentally prescribed her the wrong dose of medication. It was a simple clerical error; the nurse had been prescribing the same amount for years.<p>I&#x27;m interested in using visual encryption to help validate patient information, especially the types of information (names, contact info, treatment regimens) that remain relatively constant over time.<p>Imagine if there were an easily recognizable, thumbnail-sized image on patient medical records. The image would pose no security risk because no sensitive data could be deduced from it, but even the slightest change in a patient&#x27;s record would make it appear entirely different.<p>I think this might be one extra useful layer of security that would help patients and healthcare professionals safely validate their information. But, as I said, I&#x27;m a layperson when it comes to cryptography.<p>I&#x27;m interested in learning more about this approach, as well as the subject in general, and welcome any feedback from people who know more about visual cryptography.",1384831208

So I decided to add a rough translation for the same in the comments, but thanks to new Google+ integration - only junk is at the top on Youtube now.<p>Here&#x27;s it again (translation of only the BG song), timed for those who are interested:<p>0:59 : Those narrow streets of childhood jump in joy again ...\nTying those little sweet thefts along with it ...<p>1:35: (Same two lines above, then ... )\nWhere I would fly like a kite, like a bird ...\nThat was the time .. when my heart felt like a free peacock ...<p>2:21: When I would sit immersed in those paper boats all day long,\n... or &#x27;entangle&#x27; myself with those windows peeking outside ...\nOh, what a time that was, when there were no restrictions in the heart ...\n...

He was also quoted many times in my thesis for the first iteration of this project, mathapedia. The main point  here was to built a product with an ethnographic approach to design---a product that works without the user having to change their behavior, in this case, an academician who already writes LaTeX can start to use LaTeX2HTML5 without much web dev knowledge. This is mostly a proof of concept for something that I hope to be more isomorphic to everything you can do with LaTeX and PSTricks, as well as utilizing other packages, such as TiKZ/PGF.",1384830292

It will either be one long job or a regular job and a night job.<p>&quot;All of our children do as well. Germany has a stronger social safety net, so she decided to return with our two youngest daughters. They spent their high school years there and received a great education&quot;<p>This part doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  So his wife would rather divorce, which is even more unhealthy for the children because there is no dad around to utilize a safety net than have a husband with a job with long hours.  He was making $600,000/year.  This is enough to support them for many years.<p>His wife sounds like the selfish one and this was all an excuse to go back to Germany.  Many women want the family and the money, but don&#x27;t realize the time and sacrifice that it actually takes to get it.",1384830255

Autocorrect and predictive keyboards work great; even with a stock setup, one can type at close to full speed on a touchscreen so long as you ignore the apparent (pre-correction) errors.  Add to that the increased screen area of touchscreen devices, and you will find that they are actually <i>more</i> productive -- you can type slightly faster with a physical keyboard, but at the cost of much less context.",1384830215
6758986,comment,6756968,6758395,2,0,saryant,,,"I think the claim that future energy usage will remain static is largely flawed.<p>For one, a few billion people are currently moving from an annual income of less than $10,000 to closer to $30,000. That&#x27;s a huge, unprecedented global shift that will lead to a big increase in worldwide energy demand.<p>Second, I think ingenuity will solve our future energy supply issues. A geologist once said &quot;oil is found in the minds of men&quot; and I think that claim holds true for all sources of energy. Look at shale gas: this is a <i>huge</i> energy source that wasn&#x27;t even in anyone&#x27;s radar thirty years ago.  Moreover, effeciency increases over the next two decades, both in MPG standards, industry and electronics, could yield a savings equivalent to 13 million barrels of oil per day. That&#x27;s like adding a new Norway and Russia to world energy supplies.<p>Daniel Yergin&#x27;s book <i>The Quest</i> coveres these future challenges quite well, I highly recommend it.",1384830211

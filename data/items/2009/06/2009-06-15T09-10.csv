There is no editorializing here; just information about how the syntax-highligting works, and my experience with working on a major mode for a very complicated language (using said tools).<p>If you must downmod, downmod the <i>parent</i> which contains <i>untrue FUD</i>.",1245059680

If anyone has any links to articles they think nail this concept on the head, I'd appreciate a share, and would gladly create additional posts celebrating their brilliant works and willpower. The more diverse the better (Tesla did some far out stuff, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, I plan on adding this concept with more examples over time).",1245058894

Of course YT player could be upscaling all videos from 480x270, but that would be a bit silly. I think more research is needed before drawing conclusions.",1245058796

Given where you&#x27;re posting, I have no idea why you&#x27;d think that would be a &quot;devil&#x27;s advocate&quot; idea.<p>A wealth tax is an interesting idea. I have to wonder why it&#x27;s so uncommon. I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s some combination of being hard to enforce and easy to move money around. Such a tax would trigger a flight of capital, something that can&#x27;t happen with a tax on houses. And you can&#x27;t audit people&#x27;s mattresses very easily, so it would just encourage hoarding cash.<p>In a world where such a tax could be enforced and applied worldwide, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a terrible idea. It shouldn&#x27;t be very large, but it could have similar effects to property taxes.<p>On the other hand, we already effectively have such a tax, we just call it &quot;inflation&quot; and the tax rate isn&#x27;t directly controlled by the government. Inflation has the same good effects I described for property taxes, in that it discourages hoarding and encourages putting money to work. (It has bad effects to, no doubt, so this isn&#x27;t a total endorsement of inflation or anything.)",1376960284
6240958,comment,6239342,6240001,38,0,modfodder,,,"I also dealt with RED very early on, the post was a nightmare and still isn&#x27;t as smooth as it could be.  But the dark footage was mainly the fault of film trained DPs who were used to underexposing and pushing during transfer (hence the noise).  I was amazed when we&#x27;d get footage from Academy award winning DPs that looked awful, then get footage from DPs who had never shot much film, but tons of HD.  They understood you didn&#x27;t underexpose but expose to the right, bringing it right up to the edge before it blows out, that&#x27;s when the footage looks great.  The guys used to film were shooting with a tool they didn&#x27;t know how to use, hardly the fault RED when the video guys were killing it (don&#x27;t use a light meter, use a waveform and histogram).  And the footage coming out LOG shouldn&#x27;t have saturated colors, it&#x27;s supposed to look muddy (have film transferred flat and you&#x27;ll have the same result).  That gives all the power to the colorist as far as the final grade as opposed to DPs locking in a look (another major reason that Hollywood DPs hated digital, it was taking away much of their power). RED was ground breaking and had a huge affect on the market, although, for my 2, the Canon 5D has had a bigger impact overall (with an image that&#x27;s much worse than RED).<p>And RED fans are fanatical.  Take the biggest mac fanboy and cross him with a Patriots fan, that might get you close.  There is also a very vocal group of RED haters who spew bs for no apparent reason.  The cameras should be the tools, not the owners.<p>Full disclosure:  I&#x27;ve never owned a RED, but spent quite a bit of time in post with the footage (worked post on some of the first major commercials shot with the RED) and used it to shoot some of my own work.  I&#x27;ve owned a 5D since it&#x27;s release and have Blackmagic Pocket and 4K on order to finally replace it. I learned on film, spent a decade as a news photog shooting betacam before moving to post for features and commercials (nuke/flame and fcp/avid). I prefer working with the Alexa when at all possible, but that can increase the budget considerably (at least for me as i know plenty of great DPs that own REDs).<p>And imho, the most beautiful film release this year was Upstream Color, which was shot on a Panasonic GH-2, current retail for that camera is about $1000.  And the most daring was a tie between Computer Chess which was shot on 80&#x27;s era tube cameras and the experimental narrative Escape from Tomorrow shot on Canon 5D/7D at Disney World without Disney&#x27;s permission.",1376960275

6240955,comment,6238482,6240574,1,0,mistercow,,,"At the UI level, perceived time is usually more important than real time. Half a second with nothing happening feels long. A whole second with feedback in some form (a loading bar, a spinner, etc.) feels fast.<p>For longer wait times, this becomes critical. 5 seconds with no feedback feels incredibly, ridiculously long. 5 seconds with feedback feels like completely reasonable. I sometimes use almost entirely fake progress bars which asymptotically approach full when I have no way to measure how long something will take. It&#x27;s bizarre, but even <i>knowing</i> that the progress bar is fake, watching it fill up makes the time seem shorter than staring at a spinner.<p>Actually improving loading time is important, of course, but the ROI is tiny compared to basic user feedback.",1376960225

You know who does this right? Insurance companies. They&#x27;ll assess risk prior to writing insurance for it, and lay out what they consider to be reasonable standards for securing a home/grocery store/bank/nuclear power station (typically in the form of discounts from a high initial premium). Insurance companies are not especially nice or generous people, but they are usually economically efficient (though I <i>don&#x27;t</i> feel this way about health insurance - I think that&#x27;s a classic case of market failure because consumers are not able to properly assess or control their risk factors, leading to a drastic information asymmetry that disproportionately benefits insurers).",1376960181

I split my time perhaps 4:1 between the Middle East and India as I grew up -- enough that I knew what life was like there, but not enough that I could feel like I was part of it, or it was part of me.<p>When I came to college in the US, I had a culture shock of my own, but most of it was in the positive direction. A friend in college told me she was going to study away in India. I was genuinely worried for her safety and mental well-being to the point of trying to almost dissuade her from going. I was torn between trying to tell her she must go because of how amazing and enriching the culture and heritage of India will be - despite being an engineering student she cared deeply for the arts and culture - and that she&#x27;s better off changing plans because of how terribly violated, discriminated against (in good ways and bad, but discrimination is bad in general), restricted and confused she will be. Especially because she was going to be a (very very, even among familiar culture) attractive, fair-skinned foreigner there.<p>In my malformed attempt to &quot;prepare&quot; her, I wound up telling her a lot from both sides, and she was a little flabbergasted at my deviations from the tourism industry pitch, but took me seriously. She ended up going, she ended up &quot;having a great time&quot; as she told me and her other friends, and she also told me at some point while she was there &quot;I understand what you meant when you were telling me about this place.&quot; That was surprisingly it. She probably wasn&#x27;t nearly as traumatized by her time there as the author of the essay, and I&#x27;m glad for her. But I&#x27;m doubly glad that people step outside of their national bubbles, experience culture and society around the world, and realize there&#x27;s so much to fix that we never hear about, drowned in tourist attractions, exotic food pictures, and stories about politicians.<p>Globalization, rapid as it is, is miles from bringing about understanding of life in another part of the world from where you <i>live</i> - not tour.",1376960139

As an young child every year when my siblings and I visit a tiny village where my parents grew up, there are always people who live around the neighborhood peeping through our doors to see who has arrived and what we were up to. Even when we walk in the muddy roads or ride in an ox-cart to visit the farms,we noticed everyone lines up on the road to watch us.<p>And of course, this is more pronounced for woman. This is also part of Indian culture(good or bad).<p>But, this part of mannerism does not discount the extreme harassment the OP has experienced.",1376960121

You both need to provide the other with value, and you both need to be frank about your relationship when these values are lop-sided. And you need to be clear about what the value of the things being offered are. Your employer is not your family, your mom, or your significant other. It&#x27;s a peer with which you trade value. Every person who works is a single-person business selling their particular expertise and time.<p>I feel like maintaining this attitude can help with all sorts of stuff, including dealing with job offers, negotiating pay, etc. And key to this is having a fairly good knowledge of the value that you provide so you know what value you deserve in return.

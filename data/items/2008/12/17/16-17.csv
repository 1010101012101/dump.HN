Google can predict so well what I want, that this button is (very often) right. An awesome achievement.

401116,comment,401022,401022,0,0,mlLK,,,"Well, how familiar are you with HTML, MySQL, (or any other db lang), and CSS? In the end, a PHP file is really just parsed HTML, so anything not between <?php and ?> is just good ole markup. It also depends on what you want to get out of it, since PHP covers so much ground, but given that PHP is more attractive from the back than the front, I'll assume you wanna build some server-side applications. So for starters, in order to familiarize yourself with $_POST and $_GET (the two variables you'll be molesting the most) and the basic syntax try doing some simple HTML pages that evaluates some browser/platform condition and slowly work your way into HTML forms and attempt a feedback form. After that you'll work your way into MySQL functions and how to evaluate their output (this is back-back-end stuff [your typical db commands; creates, queries, inserts, etc]), user authentication comes next along with the global variable $_SESSION, which also considers how to handle cookies and different types of users, and lastly, after you've completed all of the following, you could attempt some sort of CMS (keep in my mind the scale since you're still learning), but by creating a basic CMS you'll slowly start seeing what an MVC pattern is in PHP. It's hardly abstract and quite hideous since you're only using MySQL and PHP, but by participating in this process you should uncover the gist of PHP and why it's so easy. After that if you're still sane, install PEAR and reiterate the process using their libraries else if unsatisfied or overwhelmed move onto something in Java and try JavaServer Pages.",1229533111

It is assumed that people with a WTP > Price (P) buy the good, and those with a WTP < P don't.<p>Your statement would be true if we could determine that only people in the WTP < P group use illegal copies. They would not affect a supplier's sales when they use illegal copies.<p>But there's no causal relation between one's WTP and one's ability to use an illegal copy. Thus, people in the WTP > P group are just as likely to do so as people in the WTP < P group.<p>Well, this is not quite right, for we may ask: Who's more likely to be motivated to make or search for illegal copies? Who's gaining the most profit by investing time and effort to search file sharing networks? Those with a rather high WTP or those with a rather low WTP?<p>If this sounds uncommon to you, ask yourself: What software is more likely to be found in any file sharing network: The popular ones -- that is: those with many people having a high WTP -- or the unpopular ones? According to my observations, the popular ones are more likely to be found. The same holds true for other products such as movies and music.<p>Whether these losses are compensated by advertising effects, is a matter of the circumstances: To make this reasonable, a supplier needs to sell (more) copies. People with illegal copies may advertise a product, but they are also likely to distribute illegal copies: What good is advertising if it does not increase sales?<p>Even if we assume that -- in the beginning -- only people in the WTP < P group distribute illegal copies and advertise them, it should be clear that it will also spread to people in the WTP > P group. The longer illegal copies are around, the more likely it will affect the sales of the suppliers.<p>Overall: Yes, it's possible that illegal copies do no harm to suppliers and may even help them to sell more legal copies. But these are likely to be exceptions to the rule. In general, using illegal copies decreases the wealth of suppliers.<p>In the long run, it also decrease the wealth of users who want or need software, for it decreases the incentive of suppliers to improve their products or invest money to make new ones.",1229532427
401101,comment,400527,400969,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am not saying that it wasn't work to create those programs. But the fact is, there are plenty of free alternatives for most software. That is just the way it is. Putting work into something doesn't make you entitled to get paid. If nobody else feels like buying your stuff, you are out of luck.<p>Personally I am using Linux with 0 commercial software installed. I do pay for the occasional computer game, though.<p>Btw, it is not only ""being cheap"" that makes me stick to open source software, it has other benefits, too. For example OS software can be bundled with Linux and in many cases be installed via the package manager. Also, I get the ""security verification"" I don't get for commercial software (I know it is not a guarantee, but it is better than nothing).<p>Also, I know that I will be able to use the software everywhere. I don't have to buy a new copy if I buy a new computer, or find myself at a computer somewhere in the middle of nowhere.<p>Also, put it into perspective: Windows allegedly is more complex than the Space Shuttle, yet sells for 130$ or so (don't know exact prices). In comparison to that, 20$ for a text editor is a lot of money. I know 20$ is not much (like 2 visits to the cinema or 3 coffees at Starbucks), but I think one can't help thinking like that when deciding to shell out money for software.",1229532420
401100,comment,400853,400853,0,0,eli_s,,,"There's a big difference between web app and web page. Common web app controls (accordion, tab panels etc) allow developers to convey lots more information on screen and well thought out use of AJAX can make a complex application perform more quickly than the static equivalent.<p>As the complexity of web apps increases users will need to get used to the idea that they need to learn how to use each app to get the most out of it which is how it works with desktop apps. Try to compare the UI between desktop apps such as a music editor, 3DSMax and MSWord. Each uses different UI controls (sliders, knobs, text input etc). Each app is complex and has an associated learning curve. If people consider the app useful they will invest the time in learning how to use it.<p>I recently had to learn how to use Aftereffects. The UI and work flow were completely foreign to me - none of my existing knowledge was transferable, but I learned how to use it because I needed the features it provided.<p>Ultimately the market will decide. My guess is that the line between desktop and browser will continue to blur and will one day disappear.",1229532374

Try small scripts and learn about web secruity and PHP pitfalls. Then you are ready to begin something bigger.<p>b) If have experiences with Java, try one of the PHP Plugins for Eclipse.<p>c) CodeIgniter is mostly based on PHP 4. This results in same outdated patterns, especially regarding PHP 5.3. If you want real extensibility (and highly object orientated code) try the Zend Framework.

This means there is probably a lot of useful functionality that's used sporadically enough that it's not worth committing permanent headspace to.  Rather, learn to be quick about finding the right function to use.  It's usually worth checking to see if there's some strange function/module that does exactly what you're trying to do.  and if there's not, you can usually find example code in the comments - though i wouldn't recommend copying that code into production.  rather, use it as a starting point for exploring the problem at hand.<p>i'd suggest learning php by giving yourself a well defined, if simple, project to start with and attacking it the same way you've learned languages in the past.  probably with some reading, a lot of doing, occasional breaking, then more reading.<p>b) notepad++ or homesite are my preferred IDE's<p>c) codeigniter, cakephp ( <a href=""http://cakephp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cakephp.org/</a> ) and the zend framework ( <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://framework.zend.com/</a> ) are the big frameworks i'm aware of, but i'm sure there are more out there.<p>enjoy!",1229530395

You want to learn PHP by tinkering with a bunch of (a) working code that (b) has been reviewed by a community of people, at least some of whom are (c) trying to exhibit some taste. The problem with the language is that various sectors of it are poorly thought out, or have been implemented several times, and the best way to avoid stumbling over them is to follow in the footsteps of some expert guides.<p>Joining the userbase of one or another framework will probably give you much of the same effect.<p>The language itself is not hard to learn at all, except for the bits that are maddeningly silly. Watch out for the array() and the way it handles keys. Find the handy online table that compares empty() and isset() and is_null() and helps you to figure out that, in many cases, none of them is the thing you really want. ;) Watch out for accidental typecasts and their effect on your logic.",1229530287

In the process you'll become familiar with the language fundamentals. I recommend that you at first build something using no framework (to get an idea of what sort of security measures you need to take, handling DB transactions, etc) and then followup with the framework of your choice.<p>I used vim/Eclipse for Java, and still use the same for PHP. There is an Eclipse build specifically for PHP, called ""Eclipse PDT."" There are several others out there (Komodo, Zend Studio) but PDT is free and therefore easier to try out.<p>I use CakePHP as a framework and find it to meet most of my needs.

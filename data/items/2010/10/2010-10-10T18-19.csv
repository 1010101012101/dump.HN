1777680,comment,1776436,1776670,0,0,Jach,,,"Replying to myself as sort of a reply at various other repliers: if you're arguing that DRM helps ""slow down"" piracy for the first week or however long a game is expected to sell well, you're now going against the article's major premise that piracy doesn't affect the sales all that much. Furthermore, this is a console we're talking about, the costs of pirating are relatively harder than just going to a torrent site and finding an EXE (that you may or may not trust) or something as simple as an MP3. We have distributors like Walmart showing shiny game cases to many people every day. A single game is 4.37 GB ( <a href=""http://wiki.nintendo-scene.com/index.php?title=Wii_Disc_Backup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.nintendo-scene.com/index.php?title=Wii_Disc_Back...</a> ). Lastly, DRM does not imply sales at all. (For those of you who forgot:  <a href=""http://www.wolfire.com/humble"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolfire.com/humble</a> )<p>The best strategy in the first place for game companies is to create something people want, as Nintendo admits. Whether you have DRM after that is irrelevant, because people will buy regardless, and people will pirate regardless, which makes Nintendo's whole DRM stance very peculiar, and now I wonder if it's just trying to make third party manager-types feel better.",1286736963

At $150 and a bit of time developing infrastructure at that price, and there is probably more economically viable heavy sour crude, oil shale, coal tar, oil sands, etc than there was ever light sweet crude on the planet.

Both genres, of course, are based in worlds very different from our own, though not too different (there are always humans or human-analogues, at least in popular examples of the genre). What's more, what these worlds have in common is that they allow people whom the reader considers analogous to themselves to become ridiculously powerful and important in a way that they just don't in the real world. An entire universe is provided for readers to escape into, and this becomes particularly addictive for those who aren't finding much success in the real world.<p>Now I guess Jane Austen is interesting in that it <i>wasn't</i> originally set in a world all that different from Jane Austen's own, but with the passage of time the world of Regency England has become almost as foreign as Middle Earth.

He gives some lip service to this later, throwing out the $2000 number without really justifying it, and he doesn't mention the degree to which those taxes have gone up, just what their new value is.<p>Second, he gets REALLY sloppy when talking about the corporate taxes. It's along the same lines as the first problem - he's talking overall rates, not rates of change, but it's really egregious there - the 8% returns he's talking about at this point are total fantasy.<p>Third, and this isn't necessarily a problem with the article, just its overall premise - As a society, we may get more use out of taxing Mr. Mankiw more than we would out of his limited-reach speaking engagement. Assuming he makes $500k, a number I'm not even going to try to justify, except to say the other poor bastard of a professor who jumped into this arena was making along those lines, increasing Mr.Mankiw's taxes by 3.6% yields an additional $18k in federal income, which can be diverted to more broadly useful expenditures than hearing an economist talk. The question to me isn't ""Will Mr. Mankiw work less?"" - let's assume there is something of a depressing effect on his outcome - the question is, ""Is this a tradeoff we should make?""<p>Finally, I'd point out that Mr. Mankiw's kids will also be able to make use of the services and institutions paid for by his tax money - this isn't a zero-sum game. He and his kids live in the country where his tax money gets spent. If he doesn't like what it gets spent on, well, join the club, buddy, but that's a different argument.",1286734114

Does revenue from Google UK count towards the total revenue for Google? If so, then since Google's UK headquarters are in Ireland, the corporate tax on that revenue is more like 12.5%, unless it gets taxed again by the US.",1286733879

How about if they get ANOTHER Android phone free for the same Ben Franklin?! On networks where the iPhone isn't available (Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobs, etc), are you going to buy an Android phone or a Motorola Razr? There aren't many other options (except Blackberry - no touch screen, no fun).<p>WP7 will dominate for a few reasons. The UI is slick and snappy. Its touch sensitivity is fantastic. Microsoft is putting God knows how much money behind its marketing campaign. They're gonna have tons of those ""buy one get one free"" deals for crazy prices. They're really putting a lot behind this release...I will be really surprised if they don't chomp up at least a quarter of smartphone market share within the next few years.<p>Android is great for tech geeks. I honestly do like Android, I don't hate it. But WP7 is a better phone for the non-tech geeks out there because of its ease of use. Not saying that WP7 isn't good for tech geeks too! It comes with an array of enterprise features that are fantastic.<p>As far as the ""next Android"" with the same UI, its vaporware right now. Not worth wasting keystrokes arguing over.<p>And yes, the OS is upgradeable directly from MSFT, not the carriers. The second that a new update is available you can download it straight from MSFT's servers. The core of WP7 is maintained by MSFT; the miscellaneous drivers and applications provided by hardware manufacturers and carriers are maintained through their own updates.<p>Snarky today, aren't we? ;)",1286733872

It's 100x faster to just grab all the IDs and values, and then grab the names one at a time (most of which will always be in memcached) than to do it as a join. Don't believe me?

Canada""<p>As far as Canada is concerned, this statement is false in certain cases. For example, the small business (income < 0.5 mln) corporation tax rate here in BC is 13.5%. This is combined state + federal, and will go down to 12.5% in 2011. The corresponding rate for the US is 40%, I believe.<p>Income taxes rates are also lower for certain income brackets. When they lowered taxes here a few years ago, the claim was that people making $90K/year face the lowest tax rates in North America.

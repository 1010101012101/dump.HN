My first project there seemed more like a body shop than anything else; a few people developed the software, and the rest of us just fed it data and wondered why they bothered with such a rigorous hiring process.<p>Some of the projects that WOTI did sounded very cool, though. My experience was pretty disappointing, but that was three years ago, and most of the co-workers that I was friendly with while working there have moved on.",1214330794

I just picked that example because I thought the two clauses of the sentence didn't fit together well and the double use of the word ""paper"" was jarring.<p>Maybe, ""Gregory's cluttered bedroom contains at least a ton of paper."" Or, ""Gregory’s bedroom is filled with paper; it contains a literal ton of printouts, articles, and magazine clippings.""<p>IANAW though. And I don't know what a literal ton is.",1214330726

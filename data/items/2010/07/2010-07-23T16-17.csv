No.<p>You think Twitter could have raised $200M from European investors?

For example, code that has not been thoroughly tested can not be said to ""work."" Likewise, one form of technical debt is code that is not the simplest possible implementation. For example, Dick and Jane each implement their own versions of the same functionality, producing code that is not DRY. This has local simplicity, because Dick and Jane did not need to coördinate their implementations, but it does not have global simplicity.<p>""Premature prevention of technical debt is the root of all evil.""<p>If you are wittily comparing the reduction of technical debt with optimization, I am confused. Optimization often increases technical debt by adding complexity, so ""premature"" optimization is a little like buying a call option rather than selling one.

This is, as far as I know, the textbook way that the World Bank recommends bank insolvency be handled, recommended over and over again to third-world countries, but somehow never got seriously considered when it's big American banks.",1279902761

However, there is no need to oppose one and the other.<p>I work for a company that was founded 6 years ago and grew to 130 people and 55 million pounds (85 million dollars) in yearly revenues by now. The company never took investment, was started without significant savings by one founder and is still expanding rapidly. We build innovative products, regularly receive awards and make acquisitions. Our profit margins are great. We're more successful than most other companies.<p>Yet, this company wasn't started as a usual startup. The business started by driving traffic to online shops using google ads. Doing this is actually hard work and it's very unsexy, techcrunch won't write about it and your friends won't say wow. But the company grew from one person to a small team, then to a larger team, the rest is history. Now that we're very profitable we can afford to innovate. Many projects that we started flopped but some survived and are either profitable or growing quickly. I have little doubt that the future of this company is very bright.<p>Starting a startup is like playing a lottery. Not only you have to invest some of your time and money into it, you also have to be lucky. Actually, you have to be very lucky. The line between success and failure when you have no cash reserves is extremely thin. You are free to  take the risk but you should accept that most probably you'll fail.<p>A better way to innovate is to earn some money before you actually innovate. Our company did it by working in affiliate business, your way may be different. Our company didn't innovate when we could not afford to lose. However, once we could afford it, we opened a sizeable division responsible for innovations and it's paying off. As I've said, most projects fail but fortunately we can afford it. We learn and move on.<p>There's a difference between doing something and achieving a result. If you want to be a part of a startup, start one, it's free and easy, I've done it a couple of times. If you want to build a business and make money, find a way to pay for your mistakes and bad luck when it happens.<p>Go out and figure out how to make some money, not millions but a little bit in the least risky way. Affiliate traffic like our founder did? Maybe buying and selling stuff on ebay? Maybe something else. Just build an unsexy old-fashioned business that will generate money and then you'll be in a position to innovate, follow your dreams and all that stuff.<p>This worked for our founder and I'm pretty sure it's a much shorter path to success than learning to code at night or building the next twitter on weekends. If you want the result, ruthlessly minimize the risk even if it means building a less sexy business first. I guess this won't be a very popular advice though.",1279902376

One big difference between Wall Street and startups is the heavily regulated nature of the financial industry. The public already has the control, but our government doesn't use it effectively.<p>I worked on Wall Street for many years before becoming an entrepreneur.  My fingerprints were taken several times. No I wasn't being arrested, everybody's are taken--a holdover from the days of physical securities. I took 5 major exams over the years and many minor ones, in order to be permitted to do my job. Oh yes, the content of the exams had little to do the products I worked on, which were all invented only yesterday. Our company had offices set aside for regulators to use whenever they visited. The public never, ever heard or saw the results of those visits. Our P&L had internal and external auditors looking at it all the time. Only the internal guys were good, since it protected managers from rogue traders. Our capital was regulated, which capped our risk only in a very vague way. I could go on.<p>What did all this regulation accomplish? Nothing in the end. Why? Regulation pits bureaucrats against highly paid professionals. Some bureaucrats are highly motivated and intelligent (I know, I used to work with a few of them when they worked on Wall Street). But their bench is not deep and the stars show up only when there are investigations to lead and headlines to grab.<p>We need a <i>system</i> that pits the smart against the smart every day. It starts with opening up bank operations to public scrutiny. The balance sheet you and I have is open to creditors to inspect. The reverse positions, held by banks, should be visible to the public. Only then will privately employed bank analysts have a prayer of calling bulls__t in a timely manner. If you think this is some kind of socialist plot, think again. Even Friedman and Hayek knew that markets can't clear without adequate information. Where do you think all this volatility is coming from?<p>Will we get this kind of transparency from the new financial reform law? Afraid not. All we did was put the A-team of regulators in charge--but they will move on after a while.",1279902226

1541562,comment,1536730,1536730,0,0,jdhopeunique,,,"The biggest problem I find is that universities avoid free market forces by bundling everything together.  Tenure is only one part of this.<p>Students pay tuition that is only dependent on the number of hours they take regardless of what type of course.  An industrial technology major has roughly the same tuition as an english major.  Students are also shielded from the costs of the system by scholarships, loans, and parents money.  They are thus less motivated, less concerned about university waste, and burdening other people with these costs or burdening their own future through debt.  Additionally their unmotivated, uninformed choices are putting them behind the educational steering wheel of tax payers' and society's money.  It's no surprise that people complain about the lack of funding for science and emphasis on college sports.  Those are the choices students have made with OPM (other people's money).<p>Similarly, faculty are paid for their experience and not subject area.  An exception at one university I know: the faculty in one department gamed the system by rotating several people in and out of the department head position so that they each could gain and keep a higher salary when they returned to their non-department head position.  Being paid the same leads to some departments having overpaid professors who wish to protect their jobs from the hordes of graduate students by raising as many artificial barriers as they can(tenure, excessive grad student burdens, etc).  Other departments may have underpaid, overworked professors who are preparing students for relevant and highly paid positions in the workforce, but who are nevertheless given the same salary as the overpaid professors.<p>Students are not given the choice of paying less for courses that are taught by an instructor vs by a professor.  It would be nice if colleges offered something like that following:<p>$600 for a course taught by a tenured professor<p>$300 an instructor<p>$150 by a teaching assistant<p>$50 self-taught with exams at a university or third party testing center<p>Such an unbundled tuition package would quickly expose the inefficiencies of the university system.<p>Tenure works in a similar way by bundling the good and bad professors together so that they must be accepted as a package deal, much like the way unions work.  I think most tenured professors are decent teachers and the truly bad ones are exceptions, but the lack of flexibility to hire cheaper instructors where there is a demand and the lack of choice for students is the real problem.  Even if a department had all really good tenured professors and no instructors or non-tenured staff, the costs to students would be too expensive.<p>Similar to the above bundling, state government jobs often require a Bachelors degree...any major...for positions that should only require a HS diploma.  This is especially bad for non-teaching staff jobs at universities which require a college degree(any major) for many jobs that only require a HS diploma...part of the universities' way of promoting their own.<p>The whole system is designed to shield participants from free market forces by bundling everything together and offering consumers and tax payers one bundled choice.<p>The university system has not changed despite increased information availability provided by the internet and online ordering of books.  Most of the actual learning is done outside the classroom and verified by in-class tests.  Surely a better system is available in this information age.<p>Full disclosure: I do tech support at a university.  When I see the outrageous salaries that some professors make, tenured or not, sometimes it is infuriating.  Especially when they don't understand the basics of using a computer.",1279901165

The second order axioms are not recursively enumerable (think computable).  It was the goal of Hilbert to find a computable system capable of proving (in theory) all true statements.  There is no such computable system.<p>One can find complete axiomatic systems of the integers.  It's quite easy.  Just take all true statements as the axiom system.  The problem is that there is no computable method for determining in such a system whether or not a given statement is an axiom.<p>Again, we humans can work in the second order axiom system but computers can't.  So it appears there's a difference between human intelligence and computer intelligence.",1279900865

6983272,comment,6983097,6983262,1,0,xSwag,,,"Yeah it baffles me too, but it costs additional time (and therefore money) to destroy data. For example, when I try to use the &#x27;scrub data&#x27; option in one of my VMs with Digital Ocean it says that the estimated time is xx minutes and xx seconds. A company selling servers for $5 a month is bound to attract customers who would not be willing to pay the additional money.",1388383189

6983270,comment,6983097,6983097,76,0,AaronFriel,,,"This is a huge problem and there seems to be a good deal of misinformation about this issue that has confused things. I&#x27;m going to debunk two things: first, that DigitalOcean is not violating user expectations (they are), and second, that doing this correctly is difficult (it isn&#x27;t). The tl;dr is that if DigitalOcean is doing this, they are not using their hardware correctly.<p>First, it&#x27;s not uncommon for virtual disk formats to be logically zeroed even when they are physically not. For example, when you create a sparse virtual disk and it appears to be XGB all zeroed and ready to use. Of course, it&#x27;s not. And this doesn&#x27;t just apply to virtual disks, such techniques are also used by operating systems when freeing pages of memory - when a page of memory is no longer being used, why zero it right away? Delaying activities until necessary is common and typically built in. Linux does this, Windows does it [<a href""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18385556/does-windows-clear-memory-page"" rel""nofollo"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18385556/does-windows-cle...</a>], and even SSDs do it under the hood. For virtual hard disk technology, Hyper-V VHDs do it, VMWare VMDKs do it, sparse KVM disk image files do it. Zeroed data is the default, the expectation for most platforms. Protected, virtual memory based operating systems will never serve your process data from other processes even if they wait until the last possible moment. AWS will never serve you other customer&#x27;s data, Azure won&#x27;t, and none of the major hypervisors will default to it. The exception to this is when a whole disk or logical device is assigned to a VM, in which case it&#x27;s usually used verbatim.<p>This brings me to the second issue. Because using a logical device may be what DigitalOcean is doing, it&#x27;s been asked if it&#x27;s hard for them to fix it. To answer that in a word: No. In a slightly longer word: BLKDISCARD. Or for Windows and Mac OS X users, TRIM. It takes seconds to execute TRIM commands on hundreds of gigabytes of data because, at a low level, the operating system is telling the SSD &quot;everything between LBA X and LBA X+Y is garbage.&quot; Trimming even an SSD with a heavily fragmented filesystem takes only a matter of seconds because the commands to send to the firmware of the SSD are very simple, very low bandwidth. The SSD firmware then marks those pages as &quot;free&quot; and will typically defer zeroing them until use. Not only should DigitalOcean be doing this to protect customer data, but they should be doing it to ensure the longevity of their SSDs. Zeroing an SSD is a costly behavior that, if not detected by the firmware, will harm the longevity of the SSD by dirtying its internal pages and its page cache. Not to mention the performance impact for any other VMs that could be resident on the same hardware as the host has to send 10s of gigabytes of zeroes to the physical device.<p>Not only is DigitalOcean sacrificing the safety of user&#x27;s data, but they&#x27;re harming the longevity of their SSDs by failing to properly run TRIM commands to clean up after their users. It hurts their reputation to have blog posts like this go up, and it hurts their bottom line when they misuse their hardware.<p>Edit: As <i></i>RWG<i></i> points out, not all SSDs will read zeroes after a TRIM command, so other techniques may be necessary to ensure the safety of customer data.",1388383185

Now that everything that was once classified as a &quot;telecommunications service&quot; is being offered instead over the top using &quot;internet service&quot; it seems reasonable for them to revisit the classification.",1388382650

6983243,comment,6980756,6982942,6,0,scarmig,,,"Sure. But you can come up with equally plausible standards that cut the other way: for instance, Germany had achieved universal male suffrage while Britain still had property requirements and was much more vigorously fighting women&#x27;s suffrage with state repression. The German High Command could mobilize troops and declare war without parliamentary approval, but, hell, we effectively allow that in the USA today. And it&#x27;s not like the German populace were snookered into the war: the Reichstag was not only willing but ecstatic to vote to support and fund the war. It&#x27;s not the case that every German was happy about the war, but response was akin to the American national rallying that happened after 9/11.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want this to become a tit for tat about who was the real democracy in the war: I&#x27;m perfectly happy to say that every participant fell far short of democracy.

6983241,comment,6981843,6981843,2,0,excellence24,,,"The best way we can get the attention of the companies is by causing them to lose profits. This is best done by an organized boycott of their goods and services. It will get their attention very quickly. But currently we don&#x27;t have a central website to browse and search boycotts and other forms of protest.<p>In addition to protesting, we should also consider building a free open source network thats protected and run by the community. (It could be run by the government, but until the government is &#x27;for and by the people&#x27;, we&#x27;ll crowdsource the maintainance and seek to rapidly automate the work that nobody would volunteer for) We can give ourselves the best, but lets start with free gigabit internet wired and wireless for all of America! What would this &#x27;cost&#x27; in terms of money? millions or billions? But the resources are here; just being hoarded until money is traded. Would AT&T build a free network for us? Not if it meant losing money to Verizon. But what if it wasnt about money? The value in having a fully connected country is priceless.<p>Thankfully we have the government to protect us against trusts and monopoly&#x27;s. But what if the trust or monopoly was a community one? If AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile colluded to give free gigabit internet to America, they could combine their separately walled gardens and use those resources to further the human race. But this would have to be a guaranttee so that once everyone put all their time and resources into this, some CEO cant just flip a switch and start charging. Once free, always free. So if they did this it would probably mean giving up their pride and names. I mean, would this free network be called Verizon? Why do they get their name on it? So we could crowdsource a new name for our free network so no one can boast. US Telecom, US Net, Free Net, the name can be anything, something we would all be proud to get behind. the most important part is the &#x27;us&#x27; and &#x27;US&#x27;. All of us in the US have the resources to take care of all of US(just focusing on America now, but eventually we could help the world). These telecom companies will either become part of the solution or they will precipitate out.<p>Again though, this would be a huge project and there&#x27;s currently no website we can go to in order to find and take part in these country and perhaps global initiatives. Imagine a mix of Kickstarter and Change.org. First a project or idea is petitioned to the community and if enough people like it and think it would be the best solution, then its opened up to a crowdsourcing page to collect funds and not just money but people can also donate the final resources that are ultimately needed, which is what the money would eventually be traded for anyways....more to come, working on this website...",1388382589

I&#x27;ve brought it up before and it seems like everyone&#x27;s reaction is that it&#x27;s not worth worrying about. But there are adversaries besides the NSA, such as malware.  And since userspace programs can upgrade your BIOS, then therefore it&#x27;s possible to write a viruses to infect your BIOS exactly as described here.  If the BIOS security model is even slightly broken, then malware will find a way into it, and security is hard to do perfectly.  Why are we trusting proprietary motherboard manufacturers not to have backdoors in their closed-source systems?  The answer is probably because we have little choice in the matter.  Thus we&#x27;re giving up a basic right: for us to have faith in our security practices.  If, say, Colin Percival&#x27;s careful security habits can simply be circumvented by his motherboard, then none of us are safe.<p>We need an open source motherboard for people who care about protecting themselves from this kind of thing. Or at least an open source BIOS. But it&#x27;s an insidious problem, because once a BIOS is infected, it controls everything that may ever replace the BIOS.

The ST had a similar M68K to the Mac 128K, but the screen buffer was 32k (640x400) instead of the Mac&#x27;s 21.9k (512x342). The ST&#x27;s CPU was more than capable of copying 32k from location to location within a single screen redraw, so I imagine the same was true for the Mac, especially since it had to shift less data.<p>In addition, there&#x27;s no reason why one MOVEM can&#x27;t contain data from multiple rows. For a 640x400 buffer like you find in the ST, each row requires approximately 1.5 MOVEM commands. No problem, since your buffer will have access to contiguous memory. Your second MOVEM call will copy the last half of the 1st row and the first half of the 2nd. Your buffer has to have a horizontal size that is a multiple of 32 pixels, but not 416.<p>I suspect the real reason for this weird resolution is boring memory constraints. If I&#x27;m reading the 68K code correctly, a MacPaint buffer was 416x200 - 10.4k. According to Wikipedia[1] MacPaint used 2 off-screen buffers = 20.8k. The ROM is 68k, then there&#x27;s probably at least 1 system-reserved screen buffer of 10.4k. The OS has to fit in somewhere. That&#x27;s quite a lot for a 128K machine.<p>Find the most comfortable painting layout where the horizontal canvas size is a multiple of 32 pixels and 2 buffers fit within 21k.<p>[1] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macpain"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macpaint</a>",1388382376

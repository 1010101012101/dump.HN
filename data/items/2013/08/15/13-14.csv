They have been doing an outstanding job. The product is ridiculously good, the documentation is awesome and the customer service is human, friendly and reliable.

6217715,comment,6217314,6217314,11,0,tel,,,"Phantom types are used frequently in Haskell to really great effect. Perhaps the most well-known example is the ST monad which allows you to do mutable, destructive updates in a &quot;pure&quot; fashion by containing them all within a narrow region. From outside of that region, the effects are invisible and referentially transparent. This is great for embedding your favorite iterative/mutable algorithm in a pure program.<p>Phantom types along with quantified type erasure allow the compiler to force these impure regions to be contained. They disallow sharing of variables or results between ST monad invocations statically.<p>To do so, most operations are polymorphic in the phantom variable. So something like `get (put x box)` is of type `ST s Int` for an `x :: Int`. The `s` corresponds to whichever ST region this action gets run within.<p>Running ST looks like `runST :: (forall s. ST s a) -> a` which means that the ST action you give to ST must be completely naive in its choice of region. Another way of thinking about it is that the `s` parameter is chosen adversarially by the compiler so that only ST actions which are able to be run in any region are allowed to be run at all.",1376574731

6217671,comment,6217170,6217544,2,0,zdw,,,"I&#x27;d argue the opposite, simply because XML has many well defined schema formats and XPath.  If you end up having versions of data formats, or are dealing with data from an unknown source, XML is far superior, and allows for easier interchange of data.<p>The correct way to load an XML document is as follows, IMO:<p><pre><code>  * Open it\n  * Run it through the schema to validate it&#x27;s \n    structure \n  * Manipulate/access it via XPath, with the ability to \n    assume correct structure as defined by the schema. \n</code></pre>\nCompare to JSON, where the process is<p><pre><code>  * Open it\n  * Attempt to access it, even though it&#x27;s structure \n    may deviate from the expected\n  * Die or try to rollback work when an assumption about\n    the data structure isn&#x27;t met.\n</code></pre>\nThus, most JSON code either trusts the input data implicitly, or is a mess of &quot;is this where it should be?&quot;/independently re-developed schema equivalent every time.  I am aware of attempts to create JSON schema languages - unfortunately these are neither in common use, nor well defined enough to be standards, and they&#x27;re more verbose and less expressive than XML&#x27;s RelaxNG compact syntax.<p>JSON is fundamentally a dump of a data structure, not a document format.  It isn&#x27;t designed for long term data storage, or for inter-compatibility, despite being used those ways.  Thus, it&#x27;s  great if you control both ends and your data structures don&#x27;t change, as is the case with most web programming.  It frequently falls down outside that realm.<p>Now, the above ignores runtime performance concerns.  I&#x27;d argue (again) that outside of web apps, the load/store into a data structure is done rarely, or can be done in the background or in parallel if there&#x27;s a lot of data concerned.

Here the lottery numbers is decided through a powerball mechanism (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerball"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerball</a>). So given that there is only a fixed amount of numbered balls the winning number is drawn from, this skews the probability of the winning number being 111111 versus another random number.<p>For example normally, if the numbers chosen are truly random, the odds of 1111111 being the winning number is 1 / 10 000 000.<p>But lets say in the powerball bin, there is 7 &#x27;1&#x27; balls, 7 &#x27;2&#x27; balls and so forth, then the odds that first drawn number will be &#x27;1&#x27; is 7 / 63. That ball is then removed from the bin. The odds that second number will be &#x27;1&#x27; is now 6 / 62 etc.<p>That brings the odds of 1111111 to 7x6x5x4x3x2x1 / 63x62x61x60x59x58x57 = 2 / 1 000 000 000.<p>Quite a bit less... The effect will vary depending on how many balls of each number there is in the bin, and how balls are replaced once selected. Some powerball lotteries has a preselection draw which determines which balls are in the final draw, but the same argument is still valid.",1376572845

In a perfect world, of course every service user would thoroughly research their providers before agreeing to their Terms of Service. The reason why that doesn&#x27;t happen in real life is because not everyone is a sysadmin/developer/privacy lawyer. If each and every Gmail user spent the time necessary to thoroughly understand and interpret the legal nuances of email privacy, most of them wouldn&#x27;t have any time left to go to work or take care of their families.<p>If we expected consumers to completely fend for themselves at all times, there&#x27;d be no need for the FDA, the CPA or, for that matter, the government. Why do you think these institutions were created in the first place? They came into being because the average consumer doesn&#x27;t have time to become a food quality expert and tour the factories that make the products s/he buys. Similarly, the average Gmail user doesn&#x27;t have time to learn and weigh the merits of Gmail&#x27;s intricate privacy policy, nor does s/he have time to learn how to set up and secure his/her own email server.<p>To say that Americans are &quot;dumb&quot; because they&#x27;re not all experts in the field that you do happen to understand professionally is stereotyping and offensive.

(men and women are the subjects of the sentence, and pronouns usually to refer to the subjects when unqualified in english) I&#x27;ll allow that its an ambiguous sentence.<p>Second - I don&#x27;t claim expert status. I just claim that a small amount of research shows that pure ignorance is a moronic position. Googling doesn&#x27;t equal facts, but certainly the links I chose - a news organization and a top 20 list to sites that look legit - are enough evidence that an assertion of &quot;where are they&quot; needs some backing beyond &quot;i don&#x27;t think they exist&quot;.<p>Third: because context matters, this is in response to a comment about the lack of male only tech scholarships, and its sexism to fix the underrepresentation of women in tech with women only scholarships. The post as a response (particularly since it starts with &quot;Agreed.&quot;) in  support of that notion. Supporting statements about &quot;where are the men only scholarships in nursing&quot;. So I answered the question. If you want to switch the subject to grants are being underrepresented (which isn&#x27;t about the sexism of the existence of gender specific grants, but about the sexism of volume) the onus is on you to evidence your claims. Otherwise it is mere goalpost moving.<p>Fourth - your evidentiary requirements are amusingly inconsistent. You want to require extra evidence from me, because you don&#x27;t like me answering the question that was asked about &quot;where are the grants&quot;, and question my method of finding the evidence, and provide tons of conjecture (but no real counter evidence) that I&#x27;m not making a good argument. Yet you are blindly accepting the claim that they are underrepresented. Even defending it. Yet that claim has 0 supporting evidence (which is less than &quot;flimsy&quot; evidence). Such a set of actions suggest a beginning bias - that you think there is an underrepresentation of grants. Like I said - its amusing, hypocritical and honestly, kind of stupid.<p>Fifth - since you have chosen to ignore the core of the argument and instead attack my presentation of them, I will assume you are using the fallacy fallacy and ad hominem to try and discredit my point rather than responding to the point itself. Usually (note, because you seem to have problems with this sort of thing - the word usually is distinctly different than always dictionaries may be able to help if you need some explanation) this means you have no actual argument towards the point.<p>Sixth - you can approach politeness however you want. Fortunately, so can I. It has no relevance to the actual discussion about sexism tho.",1376571640

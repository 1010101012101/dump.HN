And what does that really mean?<p>Two use cases:  A background task that involves a few systems, but you don't want to block the main app stack.  Simplest case is say image crunching on an upload.  More complex case is what you'd do with something like Gearman.<p>Second: You can carve up your pages into each piece and plug the pieces together. This would require a bit of coordination, but you could have a backend for headers, one for content, side bars, footer, etc. and they all respond when they get results directly to mongrel2's socket with a chunked-encoding.<p>> It would be really awesome if Mongrel2 could support something like Socket.IO.<p>It already supports Flash sockets and long polling, so Socket.IO should just work.  Haven't tried it though.  Check out the docs and look at the chat example in examples/chat/ for a quick (slightly old) demo that's just using jssocket.",1305237510

2542492,comment,2542092,2542092,11,0,shazow,,,"My biggest complaint about CoffeeScript is lines like these:<p><pre><code>  $('.shopping_cart').bind 'click', (event) =>\n    @customer.purchase @cart\n</code></pre>\nPerhaps it's just me but it feels like there's no rhyme or pattern to the use of punctuation and spaces. This is how my brain parses it:<p><pre><code>  variable(string).variable string, (variable) =>\n    @variable.variable @variable\n</code></pre>\nSpecifically it doesn't feel obvious that 'click' is a parameter of bind, and event is a parameter of a new anonymous function, and @cart is being called with @customer.purchase. If I stare at it enough, I can figure it out, but it's not obvious.<p>Compared to normal JavaScript...<p><pre><code>  var self = this;\n  $('.shopping_card').bind('click', function(event) {\n    return self.customer.purchase(self.cart);\n  });\n</code></pre>\nIf you're using a framework, you can even get rid of the 'self' bit with a wrapper that binds the 'this' context.<p>In JavaScript, where there are parenthesis, you know that something is being called. In the CoffeScript example, there are 4 calls:<p><pre><code>  $('.shopping_card')\n  bind 'click'\n  , (event) /* (Update: This is part of a function definition, my bad.) */\n  @customer.purchase @cart\n</code></pre>\nTwo are called with parenthesis, two are called with spaced positional arguments. Why?<p>If I understand correctly, parenthesis for calls are generally optional, but I would argue this is a bad thing. The inconsistent use prevents me from being able to skim code and get a feel for what it's doing. Also not to mention the optional commas in lists:<p><pre><code>  contenders = [\n    ""Michael Phelps""\n    ""Liu Xiang""\n    ""Yao Ming""\n  ]\n</code></pre>\nI see more good reasons to keep the commas (improves flow, explicit) than to get rid of them (I suppose readers could still figure it out if they tried and it's one less character).<p>I am a fan of the space-based blocks and single-line lambdas like square = (x) -> x * x<p>Instead of Python meets Haskell, it feels closer to a mix between Ruby's ambiguous syntax and YAML's indent/line-based parsing. If anyone else ran into these ""issues"" and but grew to appreciate them, I'd be interested in hearing about it.",1305237278

And what does that really mean?<p>It doesn't sound particularly useful for traditional HTML responses (unless you had some kind of simple template system to aggregate them into a coherent response), but I could see it being interesting for WebSocket applications, especially multiplexing multiple backend services over a single connection. For example, on Facebook's chat and news feed services multiplexed over one connection. Is that a typical use case?<p>It would be really awesome if Mongrel2 could support something like Socket.IO or Orbited, which provide a WebSocket-like API to the browser, but automatically negotiate another transport if WebSocket isn't available.<p>Maybe it already does, I don't know. I'd just like to be able to use something like WebSockets without worrying about the capabilities of the browser <i>or</i> backends (Socket.IO is for Node.js and a few other platforms. Orbited seems like a dead project, but I believe it used the STOMP protocol).",1305236499

Prices drift at a fixed rate (eg min(1 cent, 0.05% of price)/minute) in a direction determined by whether there is an excess of buy or sell orders, and trades execute as soon as both a buy and a sell are available at the right price.  This would give greatly reduced instant volatility in return for uncertainty about how quickly orders will complete.<p>The advantage of the latter strategy being that it is very resistant to attempts to compromise it via high frequency trading techniques.  That 1/100th of a second time margin doesn't matter because the price changes too slowly.  Therefore a long-term investor knows that they aren't getting charged ""rent"" via the automated algorithms.<p>It might be objected that lack of trading volume would make such a market initially useless.

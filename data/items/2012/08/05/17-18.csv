4342065,comment,4340733,4341307,2,0,maaku,,,"> Can someone explain to me why it isn't possible to steer the capsule with the heat shield such that it can be used to deplete virtually all of its speed?<p>They do exactly that. But Mars' atmosphere is so thin that terminal velocity of the capsule is still supersonic.<p>> I can imagine a system where the capsule pitches up near the end of its run so that it starts gaining altitude and then deploys a parachute for landing once it has reached its apogee.<p>Parachutes don't help enough in 0.007atm. Even with the biggest chutes possible (remember: they're heavy!), you'd still be hurtling towards the ground like a missile.<p>> Another thing is the crane mechanism, which is to protect the rover from the debris kicked up from the rocket motors. I was wondering why the rover couldn't just be encased in a simple lightweight protective box and then placed directly on the deck?<p>Weight. Believe it or not, the sky crane delivers more payload to the surface.<p>> I appreciate that their system probably is the best design as they are a smart bunch, however I haven't heard the reason's why some of the more conventional mechanisms weren't used.\n>\n> Does anyone have any links to the other designs that were considered and rejected?<p><a href=""http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090007730_2009006430.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/2009000...</a>",1344189485

They're all solved, when you play them you've already lost, and the best thing you can do (other than leave) is follow the program to lose the least (barring blackjack, which gives you something like a +0.1% with ideal play IIRC.) The only way to win a casino game is to stop playing. Casino games are ""games"" like lottery tickets and Candyland are ""games,"" and far less than sports books or parimutuel race betting are.<p>Any definition of ""game"" that is inclusive of casino games can pretty much encompass any process that has steps that are done in turn. They are simply spaced doses of reward and punishment doled out by a random number generator.<p>Poker, like you said, is not a casino game.

4342058,comment,4341533,4341963,12,0,chc,,,"Did you read the article? It explains this in detail. A couple of things here.<p>First, trivial bits of a work with minimal creative expression are not covered by copyright. This sort of thing is called ""de minimis"". You can't assert copyright, for example, on the words ""You're welcome"" just because they appeared in a work you've copyrighted. If you could, you'd certainly be rich, but that kind of rent seeking is a little beyond the purpose of copyright. Rebecca Black's ""Friday"", as awful as it may be, is full of creative expression. Google is arguing that rangeCheck is extremely minimal and perfunctory, kind of like if it were accused of copying the word ""Partying"" from Rebecca Black.<p>Second, IIRC Oracle is making a big deal out of this copying. Google was willing to pay a statuory fee for its indiscretion just like it would if it had actually used a trivial function from a high schooler, but Oracle is trying to make this function out to be a difficult and important part of Java, meaning it deserves a share of Google's profits.",1344189265

4342056,comment,4341199,4341199,4,0,kalleboo,,,"Communities like this were a factor in accelerating the broadband buildout in Sweden as well.<p>Here, when we broke up the telco monopoly, instead of splitting it up regionally (like AT&T), they were split into roles. So after the splitup, the ownership of all the POTS copper and related infrastructure (buildings, backhaul etc) ended up as a separate entity[0] who had to treat everyone the same and couldn't favor a single telco.<p>Come DSL. To get DSL, this company obviously has to upgrade the local switches for DSLAM operations, and for this operation they would charge the first telco to request a DSL connection for the upgrade. In the DSL buildout rush at the turn of the century, the big telcos obviously focused on densely populated areas. So people who lived on switches that were too small to be attractive to any big telco would start up a coop like this to save up to pay for the upgrade themselves, and there were several small broadband operators who would take care of the technical, broadband-providing bit. And once your switch was upgraded, suddenly you could get your pick of any of the DSL providers.<p>There were/are also a ton of small, local wireless providers who use directional antennas to service people who live too far away from a DSLAM.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanova"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanova</a>",1344189147

Or why are other formerly bombed out cities not also under populated? In Easter Europe there is still a lot of migration from the smaller cities and villages into the big cities.

4342047,comment,4340459,4341908,4,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"Although I think there are degrees of mathematical understanding in ML, and I've noticed people often mean very different things when they make statements like ""less mathematically rigorous"".  Understanding how/why regularization works is pretty trivial mathematics and if you don't understand how that works I'd agree that ML is a bit too 'black box'. But look at something like the Kernel trick in SVMs. I'd argue it's important to understand the idea of mapping points in one dimensionality to another in order to understand why you would use a linear vs Gaussian kernel. However the mathematics required to create your own kernel functions is much less trivial.  If you're going to be doing original research is SVMs I would say this is required math, but for practical ML knowledge of 'how' a kernel behaves without a deep understanding of 'why' would be adequate.  I would consider an understanding of how but not why to be 'less mathematically rigorous'",1344188981

For example, at my company we do e-mail archiving. Does Erlang have any libraries to facilitate that? No. Not even close. But Apache Lucene does. So, what we do is use the Erlang OTP Java interface [1] to allow Erlang to handle the message passing and parallelization, while Lucene handles the actual indexing and search.<p>The way I see it, Erlang makes it very easy to add a message passing layer on top of whatever single-threaded process you currently have. This allows you to scale your applications without having to muck about with their internals too much - you launch multiple instances of your existing single threaded code and use Erlang to handle all the messiness of message passing.<p>I think that is what makes Erlang such a secret weapon. The fact that you can very easily add a message passing layer to anything with Erlang greatly simplifies the job of parallelizing existing programs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/jinterface/java/com/ericsson/otp/erlang/package-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/jinterface/java/com/ericsson/...</a>",1344188315

Even with the db in memory, RAM usage really wasn't an issue for us. The runtime was initially designed to run embedded in telephone switches so it's pretty lightweight, all things considered.<p>I've heard talk that things start to get a little hairy once you scale to around 100 nodes, due to the sheer amount of messages getting passed around (there are ways around this, like creating hidden nodes that communicate between clusters). Performance across multiple VPS systems is really going to vary dramatically between different applications and VPS setups. An app that has to make lots of requests to other nodes, which are located across the globe, is going to suffer a lot more than one that has relatively little internode communication between VPSs in the same server rack, but that's just common sense.

When the security people called the (non-mobile) phone number, then someone answered and verified that it was their VISA card and yes, they wanted to open an account.<p>Edit: If my point isn't clear -- it is that the present capabilities of the criminal networks are probably much superior these days.

They disabled automatic execution of Java Applets in response to Flashback[2]. The introduction of Gatekeeper and the App Store model shows their intention for reducing the vectors average users can install random software (which reduces rogue installations like Flashback). ASLR is fully implemented in Lion now, and the inclusion of FileVault 2 suggests they are aware of and trying to mitigate offline attacks[3]<p>Regardless if you think this is enough, it does show that they are doing something. For every couple steps forward in closing a security issue, issues such as this article show that more could be done. Security is hard, no OS or company will ever be Perfectly Secure(tm). Apple is not ""doing nothing"". Claiming that they aren't is an uneducated answer, claiming that they could do more and be more transparent about it is a more valid argument.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/06/mac_viruses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/06/mac_viruses/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5242"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5242</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/960-apple-mac-osx-lion-security.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/960-apple-mac-osx-lion-secu...</a>",1344186824

The subway + airtrain thing is not up to par for a global capital. The Heathrow Express in London is a good example of what a decent link looks like. Before Heathrow Express it was possible to take the tube to Heathrow but it was an hour-long journey with stops every couple of minutes, not unlike the current NYC-JFK option. The Heathrow Express is leave every 15 minutes and takes 15 minutes. Getting to Heathrow used to be a real headache.

Gladwell doesn't purport to write textbooks, but I give him a lot of credit for finding interesting scholarly sources that haven't had enough attention in the popular literature.

Sometimes the API designer just nails it, and folks forget eventually take it for granted.  The problem is now &quot;solved&quot;.  For example, the Unix userspace filesystem API (open, close, read, write, etc.) is pretty damn solid for what it is.  I admit that I took it for granted until I worked at a place where someone who&#x27;d never seen a filesystem API (!!) was tasked with creating one from the ground up.  You can guess how that went.<p>The downside case is where the API&#x27;s model either never cut it in the first place, or as @wtallis illuminates above with OpenGL, where the model just ages poorly[1].<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9194138"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9194138</a>",1426215167

9195455,comment,9192982,9194603,0,0,mjn,,,"> It&#x27;s very difficult to pass lackluster work through these places<p>Not really <i>that</i> hard. It&#x27;s difficult to pass outright bad work through a top-tier conference, but above a quality threshold, it&#x27;s basically a crapshoot; the reviewing process doesn&#x27;t reliably separate middling from great papers. The very low acceptance rates (~10-15%) and very high inter-reviewer variance [1] combine to make it pretty random whether a given paper, of sufficiently &quot;ok&quot; quality, gets accepted or not. So the main successful strategy to accumulate a lot of papers in top-tier conferences is simply to <i>submit</i> a lot of decent papers to top-tier conferences. How many such papers a given professor can churn out depends largely on how many students, post-docs, and research scientists they can hire, which depends on funding.<p>[1] NIPS, one of the top-tier machine learning conferences, did a very interesting experimental study of this. <a href=""http://blog.mrtz.org/2014/12/15/the-nips-experiment.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mrtz.org/2014/12/15/the-nips-experiment.html</a>",1426215023

It&#x27;s been routine for so long to have layoffs, to tighten belts, to pull together in these tough times and sacrifice, that market power over labor has been internalized into the entire way they do business.<p>If you read any HR industry literature you&#x27;ll see a lot about the costs of a bad hire and missing out on candidates because they were out of a company&#x27;s budget. You will not see concern about the opportunity cost of leaving a position vacant. If a company spends six months hobbling along understaffed, waiting for the sure thing to walk in the door for $5k less, that will seriously harm their business. It isn&#x27;t considered.<p>There are a lot of things like that, aspects of employment that the employer won&#x27;t change because it simply isn&#x27;t done.

While its undeniable that you often need to type less characters in Python and list/dictionary comprehensions are wonderful syntactic sugar, its kind of nice that there is much less magic going on under the hood in Ocaml. In a highly dynamic language such as Python or Ruby you never know exactly what your code is doing: any method call can can be overloaded and even things like function calls  and array indexing can be overloaded too. On the other hand, in Ocaml almost everything is statically dispatched and the static typing is really great (I&#x27;m sure Python wouldn&#x27;t look as nice if you added the required modifications necessary to make it statically types as ocaml is)<p>While you might not see this dynamism as a big problem in Python, its something that I always found confusing about Ruby. Over there, people everything is a method call and people are super happy to monkeypatch extra methods to classes, which makes it very hard for me to understand the program by reading it. At some point, things get so dynamic that static analysis in your head gets too hard and you are better off just running the program and seeing if it worked...<p>In any case, I can&#x27;t give you a concrete example right now because my laptop doesn&#x27;t have ocaml installed on it but in my other post I already listed some of the bigger differences that the ocaml version has. The tldr is that some of the features you are using in Python aren&#x27;t available in the ocaml stdlib (so you would need to write the sorting comparator the long way or create the helper function yourself) and that creating the polymorphic hash table is not very beginner friendly (this is a cost we pay for stronger typing). What I wanted to say is that the big things about the Python function (hash tables and generic sorting) are both things you can do in Ocaml just fine.",1426213586

For example, Black Lotus, is rare but also incredibly useful.<p>Creatures have mana cost (1 mana, 2 mana etc) in the game. To play creatures you need mana and mana cards can only be placed on the board 1 per turn. this means usually a deck with a some creatures having 1 mana cost so you can hopefully play them turn one, some with a cost of 2 for turn 2 ... etc.<p>Black Lotus let&#x27;s you get 3 mana when you play it. So you can put serious pressure if you have a BL because it&#x27;s basically &quot;turbo&quot; and let&#x27;s you put bigger creatures on the board &quot;earlier&quot; than normal. (In theory a creature costing 6mana wouldn&#x27;t come into play until at least turn 6 because of the 1 mana played per turn.) There are also ways to use cards that copy other cards abilities so if you copied BL you could make a lot of mana fast. That &quot;breaks&quot; the game because everyone would start to use that tactic and you&#x27;d get a less diverse metagame.<p>If WoTC made a &quot;red lotus&quot; that did the same exact thing as BL, the value of the Black lotus would drop (pissing off collectors) and they&#x27;d have to restrict this red lotus the same way (You can only have one BL per deck in the current rules) or the red lotus would end up more valuable than the black because it wouldn&#x27;t be restricted to one per deck and people would want 4 of them. (the max of a regular card per deck.)

This not only means that those in the feild have to learn far more than other trades to do the same job as it changes.  But also this lack of stabilisation has not allowed standard certification and qualifications that stand the test of time.  Compare that with accountants and lawyers.  Yes they have new thinsg to learn, but controlled and lesser in volume.  They also have qualifications that are as current today as the day they got them.<p>There is no standard body that has recognition globaly or the history and in a market in which things change so much, it is hard without seperate area&#x27;s.<p>Other industries have governing bodies and they in part act like Unions and protect workers and standards for the fiarness for all.  Actors guild and book and music rights another area of contrast to software.<p>Lets face it software has developed a culture of free and open which is great, imagine if music and books were more towards that model.<p>So I can see why many feel the industry is and the people working in it are overly taken advantage of.  Let us not ignore all that learning and long hours has a burn factor and people burn out quicker than some other profesions.  Those prefessions factor in pay to compensate or have standard pension deals.<p>But IT is and will be a while until itself has a good standard and until then it is down to individual companies and it is not since the Googles and the like came about that  a level of appreciation for what is involved has come into play.<p>But IT is if you compare to the book industry, still defining the format and types of size teh book should be and ink colour and paper thickness and other details.  There is a lot of abstraction from creative aspects and the implementing of those.<p>Also the trade has been easy picking for TAX and with that UK introduced a rule IR35 just some may say to hit IT contractors.  Yet in contrast the building industry, they can get a CIS that in effect means you pay less National Insurance than normaly would.  Like say in other not so old industries like IT.<p>So IT is still as a trade young and with that has less protection and measure of worth than other trades.<p>Also let us not forget the move from companies to focus more onto share dividends than not and experdited trading that makes it mroe trigger happy.  If they can get away with paying 50k a year and say the job is only worth that and use that to class people as over qualified, when the job is actualy underpaid perhaps.

Just makes it more a case that not skill level and what they are paid are not the greatest of metrics  .<p>Still, startups allow you to cut out the wage aspects and many other ways get you into tapping directly instead of more often, feeding into the companies pocket from your own quality of life.<p>Still there are many things in life that have not resolved, I can purchase fair trade chocolate and know the farmer got paid fairly and yet read about local dairy farmers being underpaid for milk at a loss and no fairtrade logo on milk ever.<p>So many unfair things propagate in life.  Way to view it, if dairy farming as a industry gets treated badly and is more established than IT then, we take what we can get.<p>Least for a while yet and things are more standard.

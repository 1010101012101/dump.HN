However, I find it odd when people seem to insist that LSD is completely unnecessary or necessary to do things. Like it has been brought up before, Steve Jobs cites LSD as one of the most important experiences of his life. To rate it that highly would imply that he feels it somehow changed his psyche in such a way that it impacted who he is today. If that's the case, then you could (not concretely, but with good certainty) argue that LSD can have a positive effect on people's creativity. In fact, it does not actually matter whether it does or not so much as whether people perceive that it does (this could all be a placebo effect). Thus, the worst arguments that can be made on each end of the spectrum are that a) LSD is always unnecessary to foster innovation (Steve Jobs would argue it fostered his innovation in a way that wouldn't have happened if he hadn't tripped) and b) that everyone should do LSD at least once because it will enable them to accomplish more than otherwise possible. The choice is obviously personal and would work out beneficially for some and be fruitful for others. The important part is to remove the stigma of doing illicit drugs and to recognize that they can provide psychological benefits that are otherwise unrealizable OR acid can give you the best time you've ever had sitting on a couch. Most people that do it develop personal realizations that don't extend beyond themselves and that's all. It would be nice if people stopped passing judgment on those who belong to the other camp and instead offered their insights into why they have or haven't felt compelled to do acid.

There's no way to highlight this now and I think that is being lost.

I've watched certain movies and shows that I found profound without tripping (surprisingly the most profound thing I've watched is the Futurama episode, Godfellas).  I've done many many artistic things, drawing, painting, etc.  We built things with legos before.  Listened to different kinds of music.  Played with animals (I swear my dog could sense something was up... never seen him in such a lovey mode).  Once I mixed highlighter fluid with bubbles and created a ""universe"" on the wall in our basement (no windows, and all black lights at the time).  I've done the mundane like play video games (went for an hour in GTA-IV sailing out to sea.. it never ends).  Played music alone and with friends (recorded some).  I've tried reading books.  One time I took a programming quiz because I'd forgotten to and it was due within the hour (extremely hard).  One of the most profound things I did was go on a several hour walk through only back alleys with friends and reflected on urban decay.

And bad. You're likely a lamb heading to the slaughter without someone like him. Enterprise software is one such (arcane to an outsider) market. For instance, it's incredibly hard to sell to CIOs / IT departments without a solid channel of motivated System Integrators. It's even harder for a startup with little credibility to build such a channel of System Integrators who aggressively push your product without the leverage of strong relationships (built over a non-trivial period of time, usually years or decades).<p>I speak from personal experience - we added a Vice President of Sales from a Fortune 500 to our team, and it was the catalyst that our business so desperately needed. Within the space of six months, we were able to close over 10 channel partners and consequently access decision makers at hundreds of IT departments.<p>My advice would be this: keep compensation low, as low as you possibly can. If the guy balks at this, that's a red flag. A true VP of Sales will take it as a personal affront if he doesn't have to prove his mettle through results. I can't emphasize this enough, vest equity solely on performance (revenues realized) and set a reasonable, realistic cliff (a year can sometimes be a bit too short). Give him the authority to incentivize reps adequately. There's a great example from a company called Verdiem in this TechCrunch article (<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/06/0-to-20-million-ten-hand-to-hand-sales-tactics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/06/0-to-20-million-ten-hand-to...</a>)<p><i>Verdiems Jim Flatley taught me this at Plumtree: he fought to get early reps 15% of every sale, but after we made our numbers for the first time ever, nobody wanted to pay them less. Even after the bubble burst and every other technology company took a blood-bath, Jim kept delivering results.</i><p>Another article that you just can't afford to overlook is by Mark Suster (<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/05/the-excuse-department-is-closed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/05/the-excuse-department-is-cl...</a>), and he sums up succinctly in one line what I've been trying to convey through all this verbiage:<p><i>(Sales people) are more mercenaries than missionaries.</i><p>This applies to their leader, the VP of sales in equal measure and the moment you internalize this (and make peace with this fact), you'll find this decision quite easy and understand how to approach the entire exercise.<p>All the best!",1304092977

Once you step outside of the stream of consciousness society creates for us, it's tough to want to be apart of it again.  You feel free.  No longer a cog in the machine, but perhaps more an observer or tinkerer.  I realized for myself that I no longer have to be a part of that.  It is truly out of the box thinking.  I find myself outside of the box and generally I'm trying to find the boundaries.  This may or may not effect my programming abilities, but it definitely puts the time I have in this world into perspective.  The ability to abstract and visualize connections between objects has most definitely increased since experimentation, but I'm not sure if that's a bi-product of myself programming more, or the drugs themselves.

1273615,comment,1273241,1273459,0,0,lmkg,,,"Comparing a hockey <i>match</i> to a computer <i>game</i> is comparing apples to ninjas. The proper comparisons are: a hockey match to a particular run-through of a computer game, in which neither is art, in the same way that a particular instance of someone looking at the Mona Lisa is not art; and the game of hockey itself, to a computer game. Hockey is not art, nor is it meant to be, and neither is Medal of Honor, but that most certainly does not mean that games in general are not capable of being artistic.<p>Hockey and computer games aren't particular comparable because no one is trying to make a new type of hockey every year to push the boundaries of what hockey can be. Hockey is a single instance of a game, and a (mostly) static one. The computer game industry is continually updating itself with several notions of design, some of which have artistic merit.<p>I also think that professional sports are a red herring as a comparison, because I doubt that multiplayer games have as much potential to be artistic. The artistic games tend to be tightly scripted and non-competitive, something that doesn't jive well with introducing a player-adversary. Unless you want to be one of those avant-garde artistes making a statement about how we objectify each other or something.",1271534395

You shouldn’t be able to own ideas.</i><p>I think people who are opposed to patents could benefit from thinking about them in a different way. Instead of seeing them as ""ownership of ideas"" think of them as a bounty on ideas. The generation of new ideas benefits us all, so when somebody thinks up a new idea the government pays the inventor a bounty in the form of an exclusive right to make commercial use of that idea for a certain number of years. The great thing about paying it in the form of an exclusive right is that the value of the bounty automatically winds up being proportional to the value of the idea.<p>Now if you're a strict libertarian you can quite sensibly oppose the payment of bounties by the government, but if you're a more modest libertarian like myself or a non-libertarian then I think it starts to look pretty sensible.",1271534327

But perhaps flawed is too strong of a word, and it's just that ebay auctions don't tend to mimic real-life auctions (and maybe there is a reason for the discrete time limits, ie sellers need to know exactly when items are ending; buyers are often time limited sometimes as well: 7 days often seems like an eternity anyways).

(I think you get it though.)  Games allow you to be pulled into stories better, or at least differently, than movies.  More like novels than movies as you find yourself putting more into the story than you're given, or as in Bioshock you adopt the character as yourself and wonder what do <i>I</i> really think about Ryan? He seems okay to me, but I'm not sure about Atlas.  The story is about as artistic as a sequel to Atlas Shrugged could be.<p>Then there is the idea some games contain art.  Donkey Kong 2 isn't a game I would claim to be art, but Stickerbrush Symphony is one of the finest levels in any game I've played.  The experience of bouncing from barrel to barrel with this beautiful music and environment... I'm not talented enough a writer to explain. The music and scene are the lines in those cave paintings.<p>Ebert's hung up on the word game and can't see those moments frozen in time.  And without playing the games and giving himself over to them he won't be able to.  The over riding purpose isn't the game play, it's those moments in time where you don't just understand the story, but you believe it.",1271533870

I asked a bunch of users at my current client to fill it out to let me know how I've been doing.  I thought it would be useful for me, since I don't have any formal feedback mechanisms as an independent consultant.<p>Everyone was happy to oblige and several filled out a form.  Then I got a call from someone who, just on a whim, decided to check with HR first.  That's how we found out that it's against company policy to allow people to provide feedback to outside consultants.  This is in case the consultant gets let go and the feedback contradicts that of the consultant's direct supervisor. If some kind of dispute arises, they want everything to match the company line.<p>Having worked for these types of corporations for so long, I completely understand how this policy came about.

Personally I think that Half Life 2, say, is far better than many of the movies to which Ebert gives four stars, but not quite good enough to kick it into the stratosphere of what's truly great.<p>I guess that video games are probably the hardest medium in which to create great art.

I wouldn't take it too seriously.<p><i>One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might cite a immersive game without points or rules, but I would say then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can only experience them.</i><p>Ebert's opinion is rather polemical. I sat in on a panel he did a few years ago on this topic but this ""points"" thing seemed to be his ultimate sticking point. It looks like his opinion has changed much since then.",1271532055

I don't think it's purpose was for me to finish it either.<p>The gameplay was original and highly enjoyable, but that might not have been the point still.  It sure pulls you through the game, but the graphics and the music and the story contribute to that aspect in their own right.<p>I ended up thinking that the game's purpose was to communicate a feeling, a certain moment frozen in time when you realize for the first time that you've made a mistake, that what you have come to believe about the world is false or backward, and you're, in essence, a devastating force.  This is the moment when you want to take it all back, to have made different choices.<p>And I think I'm not alone in feeling that.  I also happen to think that these moments of direct communication are what art is about, and that they might be achieved with simpler means – a song, perhaps, or a poem.<p>Ebert hasn't had any exposure to this kind of experiences, it seems to me.",1271531292

On May 18 of the same year, en route to the Port of Halifax, another Romanian, Gheorghe Mihoc, was found hiding in a large cargo container and forced overboard at knife point by Captain Sheng Hsiu and four of his officers. A fourth stowaway, Nicolae Pasca, was discovered by Filipino crew member Rodolpho ""Rudy"" Miguel and kept hidden until the ship arrived at Halifax, where eight Filipino crewmen (including Miguel) jumped ship and reported the incident to the authorities.</i><p><i>Upon arrival in Halifax the Maersk Dubai was stormed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Captain Hsiu and his Taiwanese officers were arrested and charged with first degree murder. The radio operator attempted to escape by jumping into the Halifax harbour and was later arrested. Captain Hsiu attempted to deny access to the ship under international shipping laws...</i><p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Maersk_Dubai_incident"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Maersk_Dubai_...</a><p>I learned about this story because it's part of the theme of the concept album <i>Magellan's Wake</i>, by Savatage (which is largely the same as the more popular ""Trans-Siberian Orchestra"")",1288385872

Further, it will take some time until this person familiarises himself with our processes and systems. I guess I am afraid that a freelancer could just leave at any time respectively that a freelancer doesnt consider himself as a ""real"" part of our team.<p>On the other hand its easier to find a freelancer and I am kind of convinced that even a freelancer could be turned into an employee as soon as he feels home and loves what we're doing. And an employee is not really an insurance for something permanent because employees can also leave at any time (more or less), right?<p>My question would be: does anybody of you guys made any experiences within this area? I'd appreciate your input.<p>Cheers from Germany<p>Tino",1288385609

Is the idea to blog about all new ideas related to medicine? I see descriptions of everything ranging from toothbrushes to new imaging modalities. There are tags to sort through the different posts, but not as pronounced or obvious as it could be.<p>Secondly, what are you trying to achieve by attracting clinicians to your website? My impression is that you are simply looking from traffic (regardless the type), and trying to monetize with ads? Is that correct? Personally, I would say clinicians are slightly more skeptical about new inventions/techniques, and although not disinterested in new findings, would be reluctant to turn to a blogs for such information. This is especially true when it seems like a lot of the posts are rehashes of individual companies PR and there are a lot of ads. I would ask what additional value does the website add or function does it fulfill?<p>As a general rule of thumb, I think it is easier to attract viewers if there is a sense of community or two-way communication. My guess is that to attract more clinicians, there needs to be more value added. Maybe talk about things that interest physicians (how such a device impacts reimbursement or saves time, interesting cases and how those devices prevented some complication) After a long day at work, I doubt clinicians would be interested in learning about a new one-purpose use device that marginally improves outcomes in a specific population of patients.

Yes, it's good to be self-motivated and seek out more information on your own.  But if this guy is right that an incompetent teacher is no barrier to learning, then why do we need teachers at all?<p>My experience in grad school was that a course with a bad teacher took three to five times as much work as the same course with a good teacher.  That's mostly because advanced texts in technical subjects are supposed to be exhaustive references.  They're full of details and corner cases that make it impossible to get the big picture without reading them several times over.<p>Showing you the big picture is the teacher's job.  If they  can't do that, they're basically <i>forcing</i> you to read and reread a thousand pages of reference material, looking for a synthesis that isn't there.  Eventually all the repetition forces your brain into a kind of acceptance, but it's not the same as understanding and it isn't worth thousands of dollars a class.",1288382742

That means that if you're just going to vote for your own self interest you might as well not bother getting out of bed in the morning.  Instead people mostly vote in ways that let them tell themselves that they're good people.  Empirically, this is pretty well backed.  For instance there isn't much correlation between income and how people vote on taxes, or between age and how they vote on social security.<p>Of course people have little incentive to find out which policies will bring actual good results as opposed to those which superficially seem nice.  Luckily politicians who hope to be reelected can't do anything that turns out to be too stupid in practice... some fraction of the time.  And so we sort of muddle our way through things.",1288382740

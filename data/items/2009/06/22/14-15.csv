In Clojure, for example, a function that appears to alter a map actually creates a new map that shares some of its values with the old one.<p>There is this notion that the ideas of functional programming are more advanced, or harder to understand than paradigms like OO with mutable data.

In most of the good cases, though, the founders know each other and have a relationship. The cases where most of the problems arise are ones in which the founders do not previously know each other (what might be called opportunistic teaming). From your description, and from the length of time they want you to do work without documentation, I would say your case falls in the higher-risk category. Your legal downside would very likely be limited to losing your labor while getting cheated of any promised equity.

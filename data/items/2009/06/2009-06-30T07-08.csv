680463,comment,680245,680457,0,0,davidw,,,"I don't think it's ""obvious"".  If the company's completely closed, nothing at all is happening, no work is getting done, no one is available to cover emergencies.  A better comparison might be to look at 1/3 of the company being gone in July, August and September, which, if you work with people to plan things just a bit, means that things keep running during those months.  Also, what starts to happen here (Italy) <i>in practice</i>, is that in July not a lot gets done because everything is going to shut down soon, so no one starts anything new (no new projects, no hires).  Things already start to slow down in June.  September is reasonably productive, but it takes a bit to get things turning over again.<p>Staying open conserves momentum and provides some continuity.",1246348691

680458,comment,679791,680428,0,0,JanezStupar,,,"Maybe that proves it has nothing to do with ""You're special"" meme OR debt.<p>I'm 26 year old from central Europe. And these feelings are all to familiar with me - especially from observing what's going on with my peers.<p>What I see is that generation of our parents - the boomers took all and everything they could - it feels like they didn't leave anything to us. Except the task of cleaning up leftovers of their broken dreams. Picking up their debts - their broken pension system, etc.<p>It seems to me that boomers are ""the entitled generation"" and our generation will be know as - the useless generation. In my country the unemployment amongst young 20 - 30 is 30% of all unemployed - quite a lot well educated. Why? Because you can't get job without experience and vice versa. While boomers created system that educated us and hold positions of power while bitching how unfair the system is to their children.<p>To say I'm a computer engineer without debt and with good career prospects. But not enough income to support family solo - my GF is one of those educated young people who cant get work. Meaning we obviously aren't going to do anything about improving our demographic situation anytime soon.<p>So we either have the option of living blue collar class lifestyle (thus negating our effort in education) OR screwing over the society.<p>:)",1246347833

But you're right, it's only obvious in a simplified model of a workplace I had in my head when writing it. In real life, nothing is obvious :)",1246347719

680454,comment,680084,680084,0,0,electronslave,,,"First ""job""?  Hmm, probably one of those phone book delivery schemes at the age of 13 in rural Virginia.  Paid $7/hr, all said.  I split the take with a few car-owning friends and paid them less of the commission than I got ($5/hr, maybe?)<p>First business venture was selling polished salt crystals (that I'd found at the beaches of Dubrovnik pre-war, say 1990) to the parents of my classmates at a craft fair.  I was 8 or so, and used an overhead projector covered with hole-punched mylar to illuminate them.  Made a few Austrian Schilling that way.<p>First Real Job was at 17 as a programmer/security analyst for a sleazy pay-per-click search engine in Thousand Oaks, CA.  I got a $70k/yr salary and stock options, which I was slightly amused with at the time (having prefigured the dot-com phenomenon for a crash) and parlayed my low-paying position into a neat title.<p>Of course, this did nothing to stop me from squandering the majority of my 20s on sex, drugs and very loud music.",1246347171

680451,comment,680037,680037,0,0,rantfoil,,,"Wow, Ezra Roizen really shows he doesn't get it in that interview. He thinks he's boiled down realtime search to merely an abstraction of existing search. Scoopler (and the entire space) is not a mere rehash of Google and/or Technorati. A) there's core tech here that is fundamentally more difficult than non-realtime search indexing, and B) Twitter Search is only the first example of how realtime search can be valuable.<p>Jeff Smith of Smule did an admirable job of smacking Ezra down, however. This interview was watchable if only because Jeff made some really salient points about getting to revenue, iterating on products, and not sweating that you don't have absolutely everything figured out.<p>The key point here is that AJ and team have a product, and they're scrappy, and they're going to do whatever it takes to understand the space and win.",1246347001

It has a rapidly diminishing marketshare on the desktop, and that trend looks likely to continue.  Firefox has a staggering amount of momentum right now, and Safari is gaining as well.<p>Moreover, IE has no presence on the iPhone, Palm, Symbian, or Android.

Unless they pull a real miracle out of their hat with the upcoming Windows Mobile, Microsoft is going to be a bit player in the uber-important mobile market for the foreseeable future.<p>IE will likely linger for a long time, but at this point it's looking a lot like Novell NetWare ten years ago:  still big, but not driving the market.",1246346019

And my boss was just a voice on a walkie talkie.  It was one of the best jobs I've ever had.<p>Almost everyone I worked with was an ex-con.  Crack, stealing assault you name it.  I worked for one company where the boss hired me for the summer on the condition that I found him a replacement in the fall.  ""If you leave without finding one,"" he yelled, ""I'll see you in the street and run you over!""  He was quite serious.<p>I'm a white guy and I worked for an all black company for a summer.  My card said, ""A black owned and operated company.""  During my interview there my future boss said, ""I'll be damned.  I'll be damned!  You must be the ONLY white Willy in Washington.""<p>The job was all about having a reliable bike and knowing the micro optimizations.  You gained more speed by deftly navigating the buildings than the road.  Knowing which buildings had service entrances, which doors had guards who didn't make you sign in and which elevators were fast all saved time and made money.  I also got to know the mini subway system that runs between the capital and the senate and house office buildings.<p>But the government was the best for money.  They took so long to do anything that you could charge them a dollar a minute for wait time.  I feel like they should rate efficiency of institutions based on how long it takes for them to get a package in the hand of the person they called to pick it up.  Like gigaflops for bureaucracies.<p>In four summers I got hit by about 12 cars.  I was never seriously hurt but I did do some substantial damage to cars and went through a few bikes.  If you ever get hit, ditch your bike and jump ON the car if you can.  If you're flying through the air twist so you roll like a hotdog when you land.<p>One time I got decked by an SUV on a double rush (guaranteed 20 min delivery = $100 for the customer) to CNN in Rosalyn, VA.  I was carrying a reel for the nightly news.  It fell out and rolled through the traffic amazingly landing unharmed.  I showed up to CNN on time and covered in road rash and blood.  The receptionist grabbed the movie reel and didn't even ask me if I was OK.<p>Such sweaty, gritty, speedy good times.",1246345390

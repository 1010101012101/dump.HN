381707,comment,381360,381671,0,0,lyesit,,,"The only way that the water level could rise is if the average density of the submerged rope and anchor were less then the density of the water. However if this were the case then the anchor would not reach the bottom due to having insufficient mass to submerge the rope, and the water level would remain the same.",1228143011

Almost everyone was happy that the cheating was exposed, but I think most players would have preferred it if the 60 Minutes episode had not aired.<p>Prior to the 60 Minutes piece, knowledge of the cheating was limited mostly to online poker aficionados. Now that it has received national media coverage, casual poker players everywhere are likely to hear about it. People who were already hesitant to play because of online poker's grey legality and funding difficulties are not going to be swamped with ""Oh, you know online poker is rigged. I saw it on 60 Minutes."" Combine that with the waning interest in televised poker and the UIGEA legislation and you've got a bleak outlook for the future of online poker.<p>In the end, I think the 60 minutes episode will deal in a much greater blow to online poker than the money the cheaters stole.",1228142672

381702,comment,381360,381611,0,0,bonsaitree,,,"Ignoring surface tension effects, and assuming a much larger and relatively fixed volume and density of supporting water compared to that of the melting iceberg (i.e. not an edge-case of huge iceberg floating in a very small amount of water) and no loss/gain of iceberg mass over time to evaporation (which can be non-trivial in dry polar air) or precipitation, the water level will actually BOTH increase & decrease over time depending on the RATE of melting which depends mostly on the temperature of the surrounding water and the amount of wetted surface the ice has in contact with it.  For most icebergs, the wetted surface also changes significantly over time as its center of buoyancy changes--hence iceberg rolling and sheer surface break-offs.<p>We're also assuming the perfect case of relatively pure fresh-water ice and sea-water salinity.  When changes in salinity and ""dirty-ice"" are factored-in, it gets even more complex.<p>It's actually a very non-trivial solution which, among other things, is why predicting iceberg lifetimes and danger to shipping lanes in the open seas is still very much an art.<p>In the end, the iceberg WILL melt and a net additional volume of water will be added to the sea, but if one could measure things that precisely the sea-level change relative to the melting process will fluctuate up and down over the lifetime of the berg.",1228142297

381694,comment,381254,381254,0,0,bsaunder,,,"Robotics and virtual worlds?<p>To me, the ""web"" (as in web developers), is really about UI programming (html), system communications protocols (e.g. XMPP,  SOAP, HTTP), and data persistence (rdbms).<p>Earlier on (a decade ago), there seemed to be a lot of effort spent implementing these three aspects (many home grown libraries for these three parts).  Now, each of these three aspects have many prepackaged frameworks to make things much easier.  IMHO there's nothing fundamentally different in these protocols than their forefathers that ruled the systems in decades earlier.<p>I suspect there will be a transition to new UI mechanisms (virtual worlds), data persistence systems (note the recent rise in alternative databases), and protocols to support all of that (probably related to distributed computing and SOA).<p>Robotics seems ready to support a large influx of software developers.  This field would almost certainly require a different architecture than the traditional 'web' system as the inputs and outputs and real-time aspects seem to be significantly different for this platform.  Ergo more home grown solutions initially with frameworks and toolkits to follow.<p>Ultimately, I think it will be more about AI and higher level information architecture problems.",1228141537

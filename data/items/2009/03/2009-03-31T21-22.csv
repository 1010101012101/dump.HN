You are wrong, in that your goal doesn't imply those requirements.

For example, a task in a Workspace is a record, a file can be a record and so on.<p>There is no single authority for a record. It depends upon what the sync settings are. Say you have a record that two people simultaneously modified, when the sync happens, the conflict gets resolved based on the setting, which for instance can the last change wins or the originator wins etc.<p>Think of Workspace more similar to how Groove works rather than a shared filesystem.<p>The Tonido Domain Server (TDS) basically implements a distributed login and authority system. As you said, it basically stores a pretty name->Crypto key that can validate a particular peer and help verify the identity in case another peer is interested.<p>The identity server's job is to provide Dynamic DNS function so URLs are resolved as well as to handshake connections between peers. The TDS is distributed in a sense that you can run your own TDS with your identity domain(say mindslight.com) if you want to. Your Tonido ID will be then me@mindslight.com. There is no central system. As long as they all talk the same simple protocol everything can interoperate.<p>What we are really hoping to get to is to the point where more TDS exist and people simply choose which one they want to create an ID on, like email addresses.<p>We need to write some more on this in our blog, but these days 24 hours doesn't seem to be enough. :-)",1238536570

When you are the chief executive officer of a publicly traded corporation, you have a specific duty to your shareholders to act on their behalf and to benefit their interests.  That is the nature of the position.  As an entrepreneur if you passionate about your business, then it will likely succeed and therefore benefit your investors.  If you have little passion for your business, it will likely fail therefore significantly hurting your investors.

If the GM of the 60's had been forced to purchase a unit of pension/retiree health benefits from a 3rd party for every employee-year worked, that decade's annual reports would have looked a bit different.  And, the reports from this decade would look a bit rosier.<p>Since GM's future obligations were not obvious to investors, the stock price remained relatively high and GM was able to borrow money at favorable terms.  Obviously, things have changed.  So much so that even newer accounting rules couldn't keep investors from being afraid of the unknown.  So, the Big3 negotiated VEBAs (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_Employee_Beneficiary_Association"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_Employee_Beneficiary_...</a>) as a way of converting a seemingly unknown stream of future payments into a simpler scheme of definite ones.<p>The politics of this are interesting -- a bankruptcy would allow a judge to modify contractual provisions, an outcome likely unfavorable to UAW members.  I suppose that these changes could include the recently negotiated VEBA payment structure?<p>Thinking beyond GM's current woes, I have often observed behavior in large companies and thought: If there was a single owner, and he was sitting in this meeting, he'd be screaming.  Instead, because of screwed-up incentives, employees do stuff with dire consequences for the business.  If GM's 60's era CEO had been a majority owner (and he expected the business to stay in the family), I doubt that the UAW contract would have looked anything like it did then.<p>I once heard a marketing manager say in a meeting, ""I don't care about that revenue stream because we're already above plan there -- concentrate on the other one because we're below plan!""  Compared to the latter stream, the former was likely 100x as profitable per dollar, and additional dollars were much easier to capture.

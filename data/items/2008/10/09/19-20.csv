328163,comment,327441,327701,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Why would a profitable company fire employees because it's stock value is low?</i><p>I took his statement to mean, ""If employees are looking at their options tank, while seeing their friends at MS and GOOG options rising, the best are more likely to abandon the sinking ship.""  In the valley stock is often a big part of a compensation package, and so a company whose stock is doing very poorly cannot hire or keep the best talent.<p>It has nothing to do with profits or income and everything to do with whether people want to work there.<p>Of course, in a depression, people keep their jobs far more often, and people tend to choose steady work over risky but higher reward positions.  So, as long as Yahoo can prove they aren't going to have to let anybody go, and that a hostile takeover (which seems more likely by the day, by a Chinese or Russian or European holding company...since the dollar is so weak, and Yahoo's shares are so depressed) isn't going to result in a mass downsizing, they'll probably hang on to their great stable of nerds, and they'll probably keep increasing value in subtle, but real ways, on a day by day basis.  I think it's a company that lost focus, and failed to ever quite recover from the drubbing it took during the first bust, and has had some vision problems...but it's also a company with a great innovation culture.  Yahoo builds and launches new stuff <i>all the time</i>, tons of it Open Source, lately, though their APIs are important, too.  All that Open Source leads to them having a giant pool of possible hires who already know their infrastructure (while GOOG has to train), and a huge bunch of websites that rely on Yahoo for existence (anything that uses their APIs needs Yahoo).  Those are good things for Yahoo's long term prospects.",1223580293

I don't need to try it myself because I don't even know where to start with that kind of creative process. My mind just doesn't work that way. Don't always do it yourself first. Besides, I'm too busy writing code and that's what I do well, so there's no point for me to try to be a jack of all trades.<p>Also, if you want to do everything yourself first, I hope you're not in much of a rush to get your overall project finished. There are a lot of things that you can easily understand and appreciate without having actually done them yourself.<p>If you need to do everything yourself first, you're probably not going to be a great manager or boss. A good manager should have a good sense of what his/her employees are doing and be able to get them to communicate the most important parts of the job without actually having to do the job. Sure, you'll have a better sense if you do it yourself, but that doesn't mean that's a good trade-off in terms of how to spend your time. There are a lot of tasks that you can intelligently analyze without actually doing them. Are there a lot of crappy managers out there who have no sense of the jobs their reports are doing? Sure. But they can put some effort into understanding them without actually doing them. It's more of a communication issue, not an execution issue.<p>Finally, I'm assuming the post is in the context of getting a project finished, not running a company. But if it's the latter, then I think it's especially bad advice: taxes, legal, accounting, etc. should NEVER be done by anyone other than an expert unless it's at an EXTREMELY basic level (and even then it's still usually a bad idea). I'm sure founders with limited financial resources fall into this trap sometimes, but it can really bite you in the ass down the road.",1223579163

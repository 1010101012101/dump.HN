This is one of my <i>least</i> favorite things about MySQL. The &quot;explain&quot; feature is much less informative than that offered by MSSQL or Postgres, so figuring out what indexes or tuning to apply is harder than it needs to be.<p>And then when you do have everything indexed correctly, MySQL is significantly dumber (edit: looks like <i>I&#x27;m</i> significantly dumber! see correction below) about using those indexes than MSSQL or Postgres.<p>For example: those two can do index-only SELECTS. If table &quot;foo&quot; has columns A, B, C, D, E, and F and I&#x27;ve created an index on A and B, why can&#x27;t &quot;select A,B from foo&quot; be served directly from the index? Postgres and MSSQL do it, and it&#x27;s a huge performance boost in those two.<p>Postgres also lets you do some amazing things with partial indexes, indexes on computed values, etc.<p>MySQL might not be horrible here, but out of the 3 major relational databases I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s clearly the weakest at this so it&#x27;s funny to hear it touted as a strength.<p>Edit: Good news - I was wrong; MySQL does support index-only selects (covering indexes).

They are all held by sufficiently large organizations that the US can strongarm them into giving them up, without even resorting to immediate violence.<p>But I&#x27;d feel more comfortable trusting the Arch master keys or the Debian councils keys, because both organizations are multinational collaborations of individuals where the majority can blacklist a compromised member. It sure beats key management by one vulnerable company. So that might work.<p>It is like how people talk about all this security mumbo-jumbo but all it takes is five minutes with some brass knuckles to get you to spill every password you have ever made. With the knowledge we have and the technology at our disposal the best I can at least do is pray that my OTR conversations over XMPP are secure, given that I have tried to minimize my attack surface on all these fronts, but there is no one solution that I can say &quot;this machine guarantees me my security&quot; because how can I know that the proprietary firmware on my hard drive is not somehow circumventing my dm-crypt layer (it would need some kind of collaboration with the chipset, though, since the keys never touch the disk raw)? I certainly know I cannot trust any hardware encryption at the least, but I don&#x27;t see anything stopping proprietary motherboards from caching the keys used during hardware SIMD encryption routines (most Intel cpus support hardware accelerated AES 128, for example) in some unseen ROM the user never touches so the NSA can crack the hard drive.",1426002413

9178302,comment,9175119,9176403,0,0,manigandham,,,"It&#x27;s not, we get it. But there&#x27;s a few different points here:<p>- Context is hard. Like I said, there&#x27;s a shift towards buying audiences rather because there&#x27;s a lot of automation and real-time bidding infrastructure, so advertisers just target a demographic profile rather than caring about what site it runs on. Newer formats like native ads are more susceptible to context so they&#x27;re take that more into account but all the banners you see really don&#x27;t care about the site, in fact it&#x27;s hard to pass all that information in real time anyway and outside of Google, even the biggest ad companies are not fit to index and categorize the entire internet.<p>- I appreciate your feedback on what ads to show on what sites but the results when you look in aggregate are very different. Remember, a sample size of 1 is meaningless. We wouldn&#x27;t be running those ads if they didn&#x27;t work in some respect and every major network has tons of algorithms and data science to make sure they have an edge. It might be easy to say show car ads on news sites but different ads might perform better depending on audience, site history, location, time, etc so that&#x27;s what gets shown.<p>- For the most part though, you will see tech-related ads on tech sites, the industry isn&#x27;t that bad at targeting and relevance. It&#x27;s really really hard to believe you never see ads that are at least the slightest bit related to the site.<p>- Being followed by products/companies you bought goes back to what I mentioned about retargeting. It&#x27;s works really well. However, it again comes down to tracking. If you don&#x27;t want to be tracked, how are we supposed to know you&#x27;ve bought something? Remember there&#x27;s never just one single ad company that knows everything, there are hundreds of different databases tracking different things. Ecommerce/purchases are under even stricter privacy rules than just browsing habits and also more valuable data so companies don&#x27;t give up access easily. It&#x27;s about 100x more complicated if it&#x27;s an offline sale (like buying something at your local store) and trying to tie that back to an online user. We&#x27;re good at tracking but we&#x27;re still humans and the tech is impressive but it can&#x27;t just magically know everything while still respecting people&#x27;s privacy wishes.<p>- Pricing is another complicated issue. Part of digital advertising is the ability to track certain actions so the efficiency of performance ads increases by only paying when things perform (clicks, signups, etc). So no performance advertiser will pay CPM when they can pay CPC/CPA instead, and as soon as one network offers it, the rest have to follow or start losing business. It&#x27;s just not that easy to avoid.<p>Hope that helps clear up some your questions.",1426002088

This obsessions with plaigarism is utter crap.<p>I know this is an opinion, but I have built a philosophy through years of failing at tasks.  If you do not do your work, who cares?  Time and time again, I see kids that cheat and they never tread water.  Even if they graduate, they have problems.  Because the final product is irrelevant in the education process, it is the developmental process you are paying for.  The real world is dissimilar of course, but without skills and reasoning skills it is harder and harder beat competitors when making a superior product, whatever it is.  Therein lies the rub.<p>I was a language major, intentionally or not, because I wanted to study in speciliazations where there is a binary choice: you know or you do not, you are fluent or you are not.  Now there are tests that &quot;prove&quot; that, but only by application and communicating in a native way you can advance and miscommunication with a native speaker reminds you which side of the spectrum you are on.  It took me longer to appreciate it, but computer science, as an extension of the language of mathematics, is something you apply and grasp, or you do not.  You cannot fool a computer into a sorting algorithm without grasping and explaining the requisite steps (unless you end in system administration and the continued absence of 4th generation languages, haha).<p>No academic institution will espouse this view, as credentials cost money, and cheating devalues the brand when moronic indivdiuals with said credentials showed they have no skills in applying skills or analyzing info.<p>Just my thoughts.

9178116,comment,9177404,9177954,0,0,mcherm,,,"> Why is this bad?<p>That is an excellent question. Part of it comes down to the fundamentals of ethics. If I believe, for instance, that the bedrock of ethics is &quot;do whatever is best for me&quot; and I happen to be one of the rich folks, then this may not seem so bad. If I take as one of my basic ethical principles &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.&quot; then a high Gini index is patently unfair.<p>If the answer depends on what basic principles of ethics you accept then in a certain mathematical sense there is nothing to say here. Once a proposition has been proven to be true or false depending on what axioms you use, there is no sense in proving things anymore, we can just argue about which axioms we like best, or perhaps just stop discussing it. Philosophers have spent (literally) centuries arguing over what fundamental principles to base ethics on, and nothing has been permanently settled.<p>But I will make this observation. Human beings seem to have a basic, built-in sense of &quot;fairness&quot;. Researchers have conducted experiments where two participants are given something (like cash) and one picks how much to take, then the other decides whether both get their amounts or get nothing. Many (perhaps most) participants will split it 50-50. More interestingly, if the first player splits it 95-5, the second player will usually get indignant and decide that both will walk away with nothing. Most humans would rather give up a free $5 in order to prevent someone else from getting &quot;more than their share&quot;.<p>Now, I can&#x27;t say whether you are one of the people who would act that way -- as mentioned before, different people have different takes on the fundamentals of ethics and I don&#x27;t know what moves you. But this example may help you to understand why many people have a visceral distaste for high Gini indexes.",1426000277

Truth is:  there <i>is</i> a social (and business) need for quality and reasonably unbiased information.  There&#x27;s also value to those who want to control such a feed (the dark side of media).  Advertising has sustained the concept in some form or another for several hundred years, with a few big shake-ups.  But there&#x27;ve also be (and continue to be) highly ideological organizations (see Fox News / NewsCorp / WSJ, well know, but also <i>The Economist</i>, and on the left, papers such as <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i>, or <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>).<p>The problem, in an online era, of subscriptions only is that it closes your distribution down <i>too</i> much.

For the purposes of the experiment, you&#x27;re not supposed to be able to tell which universe is which by observation of the universe itself (i.e. there is no property of p-zombies that gives them away as p-zombies), but from the outside looking in I guess you have a label for one and a label for the other.<p>Like I said, it doesn&#x27;t seem germane to the thought experiment anyway, which doesn&#x27;t allow for epsilons, at least none that could have a causative effect on anything. Like, if you have universe A with no consciousness, and universe B with orange-flavored consciousness, and universe C with grape-flavored consciousness, and finally universe D with cherry-flavored consciousness, and none of them are distinguishable from the others except for universe A and universe D, then you&#x27;re violating the terms of the thought experiment because you have two supposedly physically identical universes which are nonetheless distinguishable by dint of their underlying consciousness substrates (or lack thereof).<p>Anyway you&#x27;re right, it is a weak argument, but only because it doesn&#x27;t go far enough in outlining why p-zombies are ridiculous (which, IMO, the argument I presented instead, does).",1425999834

9178059,comment,9177404,9177954,0,0,onion2k,,,"Having exceptionally wealthy people in a market puts an upward pricing pressure on goods that have a limited supply. For example, if two very rich people want the same house they can bid for it and one will win. That person who sold the house now has more to spend on their next house, so they pay more in turn, and so on down through the market. In theory that means everyone wins - with the notable exception of a person who is buying their first house. They face higher prices with no external wage stimulus to give them the additional purchasing power to buy. Consequently they&#x27;re shut out of the market.<p>Now extrapolate that to <i>all goods</i>. Poor people just can&#x27;t buy things if there are people at the top end of the market with vastly more wealth than them. If that happens then people start to starve, get sick, or resort to crime more. Society is worse for it. There&#x27;s little point in being hugely wealthy if you can&#x27;t leave your lovely secure house without feeling the city you live in is a horrible place.<p>The concept is called &#x27;private wealth versus common wealth&#x27;.",1425999742

InnoDB has fulltext from MySQL 5.6+<p>3. I agree utf8mb4 should be renamed &quot;utf8&quot;. When this was introduced it was given a new name to support downgrades, but the feature does exist :)<p>4. RAND() is actually deterministic (via other meta data written to the binlog).  In any case, MySQL also supports Row-based replication and it is the proposed default for 5.7.<p>5. I would like to have this feature too :)  It is important to note that few databases have this though.<p>6. MyISAM is no longer the default.  PITR works fine with InnoDB.<p>7. The logging verbosity can be changed.  In MySQL 5.7 there is a new server logging API which makes sure the output format is consistent.  For some of the meta data you are suggesting, the better place to retrieve this is performance_schema.<p>8. You are probably talking about gap locks etc.  These are required for statement-based replication, with Row-based they are not required.<p>10. I would suggest that ARCHIVE engine is of limited use-cases.<p>11. Please see <a href=""http://mysqlserverteam.com/the-mysql-5-7-6-milestone-release-is-available/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mysqlserverteam.com/the-mysql-5-7-6-milestone-release...</a> (search &quot;innodb native partitioning&quot;).  Allowing more arbitrary functions would most likely require global secondary indexes.  5.7.6 contains an important change to move in that direction.<p>12.

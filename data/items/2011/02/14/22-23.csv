I just can't get my head around thinking otherwise.  Can it work your way?  Yup.  Can it work other ways?  Yup.  All over-generalized advice works some of the time, that's why it exists in the first place.  It probably even works most of the time.  My problem isn't with the advice's hit rate--nothing is perfect--it's with the logic behind it.<p>""I keep seeing big name firms repping pre-funded startups, which is a death wish in my opinion.""<p>If a big name firm is working for a startup before it's funded I'd bet a lot of money that they're doing it for stock or deferred comp.  That's almost never cash.  Whether that's a good deal depends on the firm, the startup, the deal, etc, but no agency is getting $20k/month out of a startup that hasn't raised anymore unless it's very well self-funded.<p>""Companies and PR firms just throw up garbage press releases a lot of the times and this could be some valuable feedback for them.""<p>Lots of agencies suck at this is an example of it.  No disagreement here.  And I don't think advice on PR from a journalist is necessarily bad, but I believe not enough scrutiny is directed at the source.  To be fair, I say the same thing about fundraising advice from VC's.  Not a bad thing, just silly to take it on face value.",1297724231

In other words, I don't have a problem with a company making proprietary offerings if such offerings give me better value than what otherwise exists and, if I don't like them, I don't have to deal with them.<p>So, I feel I have my freedom today, just as I did years ago when IBM dominated enterprise computing, and that is why I am (as I said above) quite relaxed about the idea that private corporate interests can control and dominate their respective fields of activity.

Signals sent on TV or radio-sized frequency travel farther and are less vulnerable to interference than cell phone signals or LTE just about anything else except for some channels reserved for military communication. We have the ability to send a whole lot of data over the air more robustly than we can right now, but it's being used to support obsolete technology.<p>The FCC auctioned off or gave away a lot of prime spectrum to radio and TV providers back when it wasn't nearly as precious as it is today, and they adopted old, inefficient formats that need an enormous range of frequencies to transmit very little data. Do you know anyone who has used broadcast television over the past ten years? I don't, and I don't think I know very many people who have either. Yet we still use a whole lot of really good VHF space for wasteful analog communication. Meanwhile, the channels used for some of the most important things, like Wi-Fi, need to use some of the crappiest spectrum around, because everything else has been allocated already.<p>Things are improving, albeit slowly. The switch from analog to digital broadcast TV is opening up a whole lot of space, much of which is being used for WIMAX.

An encyclopedia is supposed to provided a summary of a subject, a launching off point, a confirmation of a subject's existence. It should provide exhaustive breadth. In wikipedia's case, it was even able to provide a bit of depth through external citations, and through hyperlinking to other parts of itself.

It's like saying you don't need a VP Engineering because a founder should do it.  Completely fine conclusion if it works, as it often will, but still total nonsense.<p>If you're paying a PR agency $10k-$20k per month and they're getting your company into blogs where the author reads every comment, you're getting screwed.  No doubt about that.  And if you can do it yourself through networks and hard work, then paying someone else to do it might not make sense.<p>But to argue that PR firms are not effective is just a lie.  I won't go through linking to the major news coverage that any startup would kill for that PR firms got, but there is plenty.<p>There are two interesting dynamics at play in this sort of post, which comes up every week or two.<p>1. No one ever seems to question the source, which seems odd.  We have a journalist telling companies how to run their PR.  Talk about the fox watching the hen house.  I'm not saying this guy or any of the others that write this same blog post on other blogs are being disingenuous, but the conflict of interest is certainly there.  It's worth pointing out in my opinion.<p>2. PR firms, ironically, suffer from being in a position to almost never get positive word of mouth (at least publicly).  When they succeed, you never know they're involved; go read the front page of the NYT business section, I promise it produces lots of PR high fives every day but almost no one reading it will ever know that.  When a company succeeds with a PR firm, there's not much incentive in beating their chests about it, but when the relationship is a failure it's become fashionable to...well, write something like this except from the company's perspective.  To top it off, the really great PR firm successes often masquerade as the sort of companies that are just great stories told by great founders (Mint and Pandora come to mind, both of which use agencies).<p>I used to work at a PR agency about 2 years ago, but don't any longer and have absolutely 0 financial stake in this sort of thing.  I still help/advise a lot of friends on PR and I really just think this is overly generalized advice that leads to a nasty case of groupthink.  First principles, guys.",1297721395

We received top tier press but it never came close to paying off from any business POV. It felt nice, but running out of money felt like shit...I do think there is a critical mass of press that can propel a co to success or atleast longevity, take for instance Quora, or twitter a few years ago. Unfortunately most will never hit that tipping point where the press can compound on itself and translate into growth.",1297721277

2218898,comment,2216977,2218019,0,0,chipsy,,,"The main difference is that each time we go through this cycle it becomes easier to forget that we have overlords, because each one controls less and less.<p>Go back to the pre-industrial era, and you own essentially nothing unless you're royalty. Move forward into the mid-19th century and the picture has changed - bankers and railroad barons have grown powerful enough to assert some control over governments. By the 20th century you have a whole array of public services(water/phone/gas/electric). And today, the big discussions are mostly over information businesses.<p>Example: Even though Apple, Amazon and Netflix have done a lot to usurp the nature of retail and media publishing and can be seen as ""tyrants"" of their respective markets, they've given up control in other ways; you have considerable freedom to publish and distribute products through their services. They still curate, but not extensively. And, on balance, they offer a better profit/consumer value ratio.<p>The overall picture adds up to something more complicated than ""new tyrants, same as the old"" - the quest for profit is increasingly causing them to battle each other, as they keep stepping on each other's toes, and that's forcing a kind of competition that was unimaginable in previous eras. It's still imperfect because some elements of the system will occasionally try to take the rest hostage(e.g. banking, recently), but some amazing things are happening regardless - Twitter revolutions, anyone?",1297721204

4129635,comment,4129125,4129125,3,0,anaheim,,,"I generally hate Microsoft stuff (including Windows 8), but this is a refreshingly original and good design (personal opinion, of course.) Since Zune and XBox, Microsoft seem to have sharpened their game to the point where they are capable of delivering small, compact, and useful hardware which functions well. Some people mocked the Microsoft Mouse in the initial stages of the presentation, but come to think of it, most people I know prefer Microsoft's ergonomic laptop mice to Apple's Mighty Mouse, which, quite frankly, is rubbish.<p>Priced at the right point, this could take aim at a number of different devices, which it seems to fit at the smooth spot between:<p>- Stylus-capable tablets you can actually write on (IBM x series)<p>- Small media-capable tablets like the iPad/Kindle Fire (for consuming eBooks, media and the Web).<p>- eBook readers like the standard Kindle. I don't know what digital Ink capable means, but if it goes any way towards making eBooks more readable than they are on the Fire/iPad, consumers will buy this device just so they don't have to buy different things for watching videos and reading books with lesser eyestrain.<p>I bet that both this and the Lumia and other Windows phones are going to be massive in markets like India, which know Microsoft and Nokia well, and have never seen much of Apple tech.",1340067557

4129632,comment,4129125,4129618,18,0,sho_hn,,,"You're making a bunch of key mistakes there:<p>a) Only the ARM version is running Windows RT. The Intel version I wrote about is using ""Windows 8 Pro"", which contains the regular Windows desktop.<p>b) A BT keyboard for the iPad is something you need to select separately, and schlepp around inconveniently. A cover goes together with the device. Stuff like this matters.<p>As for whether it's doing anything new, dunno. The thing is that with products like this, it's a matter of degrees and refinement - at some point you cross a threshold and a concept works. That's why the iPad works, but Tablet PCs didn't.<p>The product most similar to the Intel-powered Surfcace + Touch Cover is the Android Transformer Prime with the optional keyboard dock. But the keyboard dock isn't as svelte as the Touch Cover, and Android doesn't have the application base of desktop Windows when used as a laptop replacement. And yet the Prime garnered a lot of interest. Microsoft seems to be in a unique position to offer this refined version of the idea.<p>Will anyone want it? Time will tell.",1340067513

4129621,comment,4129125,4129125,11,0,thought_alarm,,,"I occasionally use a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPad when I feel like firing off a bunch of email from my recliner.  The keyboard is on my lap and the iPad is off to the side.  It's nice because it's literally the exact same keyboard I use with my laptop and my desktop.<p>The Surface's attached, floppy keyboard wouldn't work for me at all.  If I need to set up at a desk then I'll just pull out my laptop.<p>The concept of a screen-cover/keyboard is interesting, but I'm not sure how practical it is in real life.  Virtually 100% of the time I use my iPad it (or its BT keyboard) is on my lap.  (As I type this I'm sitting on a lawn chair on my patio).  And if it's not a full stroke keyboard then I don't see it as being very comfortable to use.<p>I also dislike the 16:9 screen.  On a tablet, 16:9 is useless for everything but movies: Too wide to thumb-type in landscape, too narrow and tall in portrait.<p>I also suppose they'll be able to severely undercut OEM manufacturers on price, especially of this thing stumbles out of the gate.  If I were Dell or HP I would seriously question how to move forward.<p>But ultimately success will depend on the software.  Microsoft is going to be ramming Metro down the throats of faithful Windows users in a few short months.  If users love it, they'll surely flock to Metro tablets where they can use the apps they've already collected on their desktops, and Surface becomes the quick number 2 tablet.

For the people that understand this, that's implied by the Windows logo. The closest I got to settling on an iPod/Android tablet was when OnLive came into existence.

Stylus alone (resistive touch) is not a good general purpose input system but works really well for inputting hand writing or drawing. Capacitive touch lacks fine resolution so it's not good for drawing but it's fantastic for UI because it supports multi-touch. Today we don't have to be shackled by the technological limits that held the Newton back. The Surface has both types of touch sensors so it can match the appropriate sensor to the appropriate use (drawing/writing or touch-based UI). Also, modern mobile computers have vastly more processing power and storage capabilities so, ironically, handwriting recognition is not necessary. The raw input can simply be stored away (as a vector graphic, perhaps, or even just as raw pixels).<p>Also, the general pattern of ""someone tried that once, and they failed, so nobody should ever do that"" is a really terrible way to go about engineering. Wile E. Coyote should not be a roll model. Just because someone failed at something similar. Just because YOU failed at something similar, doesn't mean you should give up on the whole idea.",1340066663

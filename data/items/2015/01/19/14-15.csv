8912135,comment,8910367,8910367,0,0,kendallpark,,,"I enjoyed reading this piece.<p>I have a personal hypothesis that repression, especially in childhood, can effect the amount of dysphoria that <i>some</i> people on the trans* spectrum feel, which in turn effects their need to transition. (I should mention that I&#x27;m genderqueer female with too trans* roommies, so I am pretty active in this space.)<p>Though I do experience small amounts of dysphoria, I never tried to conform to all the feminine gender expectations (despite quite a few external forces trying to pressure me to do as much). It meant I was always butting heads with my mother over what I would wear and what activities I would pursue, but I never compromised who I was to make life easier for other people. I think, because of this, I never made a bad association with being female, or at least the minor amounts of dysphoria stayed minor.<p>As much as I would love better gains in the weight room from testosterone, I feel that I would lose so much of my uniqueness by transitioning. It&#x27;s not often that you meet a female football player/gamer/programmer. But if I transitioned, I&#x27;d just be your average dude. I love being the odd-man-out and challenging stereotypes. I&#x27;m a girl. I&#x27;m a bro. Sometimes I throw on a pretty dress just to mess with people. It&#x27;s great.<p>I think there are a lot of people like me and the author that are kind of in the middle where childhood and social factors can play a role on whether transitioning is the best decision.",1421679360
8912134,comment,8910074,8911137,0,0,graycat,,,"The Wankel was asking a lot of the \nseals at the edges of its \nspecial <i>rotor</i>; apparently it\nwas asking too much.<p>> Fuel economy wise though, the traditional piston engine outperforms the Wankel engine.<p>Yes, piston rings work a lot better than the\nseals Wankel needs.  And, now with pistons, \nwe can use high compression ratios;\nthe Wankel seals have problems which get\nmuch worse at higher compression ratios.<p>Why high compression ratios?  Simple, classic\nCarnot cycle physics:  The higher the compression\nratio, the more get out of the fuel.<p>Why higher compression ratios now?  Because now\nwe can have direct fuel injection, directly\ninto the combustion chamber, much as in a\nDiesel.  So, then can do all the turbo charging\nand supercharging want, for still higher total\ncompression ratios because don&#x27;t have to\nworry about pre-ignition from the air being\ntoo hot from the compression it got\nbefore entering the cylinder.  So, don&#x27;t\nhave to use an intercooler to\ncool the compressed air.<p>Why supercharging or turbocharging?\nBecause get more power out of the\nsame basic engine of pistons, cylinders,\netc., that is, more power without\nmore friction from larger pistons.\nSo save on friction.  So two savings\nfor fuel economy:  Higher compression\nratios and less friction.\nThat&#x27;s what Volvo and others are doing:\nSmall engine, lots of boost, good\npower and good fuel economy.<p>I suspect a good way to get both\nrange and fuel economy with an <i>electric</i>\ncar is to have a <i>hybrid</i>:  So, have\nan internal combustion engine drive a\ngenerator to charge the batteries.<p>Here can have an advantage:  The \nengine need run at only one power setting,\nits most efficient.  Then for such\nan engine?  Sure, use a gas turbine\nso that we are back to basically just\none moving part.  Yes, in an axial flow \ngas turbine, the part that rotates,\nat, say, 30,000 RPM or so, is darned\nexpensive, but that part is also \ndesigned for the engine to have some\nability to have a throttle.  If give\nup the idea of a throttle and have only\none power setting, then we can return\nto centrifugal force for both the\ncompressor and the turbine.  Then\nthe metal for the high temperatures\nis expensive, so can use some ceramic.<p>Now we&#x27;re talking:  Just one major moving part,\ncheap ceramic, centrifugal force,\nsingle power setting (where the aerodynamics\nfor the compressor and turbine work best).\nMight get 200 HP in a small package.  \nThen run it only when charging the battery.<p>Then never bother plugging the car to\ncharge the batteries.  When \ndriving around town, nearly never run the\nturbine.  On the highway at 65 MPH, occasionally\nrun the turbine.  Blasting across, say,\nNevada at 110 MPH, run the turbine a lot.\nAt top speed of 150 MPH or so, sure, run the\nturbine 100% of the time and still have the\nbattery run down.<p>Sure, get some losses when generate the\nelectric power, when stuff it into the\nbattery, when draw it out of the battery,\nand when drive the electric motor.  Yup,\nseveral losses.",1421679359

8912112,comment,8911445,8911445,0,0,nly,,,"Neither HPKP nor HSTS deal with the issue of a-man-in-the-middle doing a downgrade attack against clients who are visiting a site for the very first time (which can be encouraged through phishing). There are only three ways to deal with this that I can think of:<p>1) Deprecate insecure HTTP. Literally get all the browsers to agree on a deadline X years out and then drop support for it entirely. HSTS would become irrelevant. I hold little hope of this ever happening, even in a HTTP/2 world. See IPv6<p>2) Keep increasing the size of the trusted, preloaded list of HTTPS enabled sites shipping with browsers: Neither the implementation nor the process to manage the list scales. It&#x27;s just crappy all-round.<p>3) Standardise some SRV records for web protocols in the DNS so browsers can efficiently determine what is supported: Requires DNSSEC to prevent downgrade attacks.<p>Of these, #3 seems to me to be most practical. With regard to DNSSEC issues I would give these counterpoints:<p>* DNSSEC could and should be augmented to support ECC, obliterating the concerns with regard to large records and weak RSA key lengths.<p>* Browsers (or your OS&#x27;s dnscache process) can cache DNS responses from most of the chain. If the ZSK hasn&#x27;t been rolled over for a particular domain then I don&#x27;t see the need to reverify it again on each request. It&#x27;s not like revocation really works in HTTPS today anyway, so you probably aren&#x27;t going to bother to check upstream for NSEC records on each request. Or just recheck upstream once a day. I don&#x27;t really know, but I&#x27;m sure these latency issues can be minimized. Googles obsession with latency is how we ended up with the barf that is HTTP/2 rather than something that actually improves websec in the first place.<p>Another thing I don&#x27;t often see people mention about HSKP and HSTS, regardless of whether they can be used as &quot;supercookies&quot;, is that they create a more-or-less permanent shadow browser history on your machine.

Yes, there are languages that broadly offer faster execution, but that&#x27;s far from the only factor in choosing a solution.<p>The main issue from my perspective is that the event loop can easily get blocked by CPU-bound tasks, preventing it from doing other things, e.g. responding to HTTP requests. You hit a similar problem with a Java servlet runner, eg. if a couple of your threads are bogged down on CPU-heavy tasks then they can&#x27;t be responding to requests.<p>My personal preference would be to split CPU-heavy operations out so that they happen elsewhere, regardless of language, e.g having large PDFs generated by an internal microservice rather than by the webserver, or maybe via a queue in some cases.

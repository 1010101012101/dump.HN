The 1960s heritage shines through here too. In the original series, hooking up a Big Honking Computer that gives the Enterprise some sort of drone-like control possibility was a Big Deal, the focus of an entire episode. And they had to actually bring in new hardware, it wasn't just a software patch.<p>I've seen a moderately serious treatment that suggests that in a fight between our modern military and the Enterprise, the modern military might very well win. The Enterprise does have the ability to slag its choice of ground target, and we'd have a hard time retaliating as long as it stayed in orbit, but that is pretty much all they could do. It seems it would be trivial to block their transporter, shuttles may be shielded but they seem to be slow and one imagine we could wear them down even with conventional weaponry, and Federation ground troops are laughably incompetent by real military doctrine standards, armed with a single line-of-vision ray weapon that immediately gives away their position every time they use it, somehow no air support, and their use of this weapon is also incompetent. Any modern military would chew them up on the ground, to say nothing of the elite ones.<p>Also it seems like any ol' script kiddie from real modern Earth would be able to penetrate their computer security by accident.

I think in early TNG, it's implied that the Enterprise has what it thinks to be a much safer job, what with all the diplomatic missions and always being in closer contact with Starfleet. There's an entire episode where Q introduces them to the Borg just to remind them the galaxy is still dangerous.<p>Given how often Earth itself seems to be attacked, maybe they just realized there's no safe place in the galaxy so the families might as well be around to keep up the morale of the troops.",1328722535

My point was that this isn't an optimization of the JIT compilation, so much as it is a requirement for a JIT compiler to be able to operate. The compiler has to know what defines an execution frame. Once you've done that, there are definitely other optimizations that go in to reducing the opacity of your interpreter to the JIT compiler.<p>So, you're probably right that a fair amount of optimization can come from doing a good job of defining what identifies an execution frame. I'm curious though, if these are the sorts of ""low hanging fruit"" the author was referring to, or if they're included in the straightforward port of the original C interpreter.<p>From the section on ""Optimizing an RPython JIT"" it seems that the he's doing a lot more than just defining his execution frame.<p>> The first tactic is to remove as many instances of arbitrarily resizable lists as possible. The JIT can never be sure when appending an item to such a list might require a resize, and is thus forced to add (opaque) calls to internal list operations to deal with this possibility.",1328722515

This person is talented w/marketing, and a good guy - thru separate avenues we both had landed at the same conclusion and were hoping to start companies in the same space. This guy works currently at a company with lots of awesome engineers, and is friends with some of them (as much friends as an engineer and marketer could be) and so his main value add for me was effectively buying access to the engineers in his network.<p>To take the potential fit further, we filled in Dan Shapiro's equity calculator together (and some others) and that's where I am at now, and looking for some feedback from you guys...<p>Maybe it's a function of crappy calculators, maybe my expectations are way off, the calculators spit out 55% me, 45% him, including the fact that I'm building the product myself, and we were basically evenly matched on other categories. It left me feeling confused, and the potential co-founder with the sense that it was fair.<p>The potential co-founder talked to his MBA buddies who think 30% is minimum for being involved. Even if we did Dan's calculator wrong, I still feel like 30% is absurd for a business-only hustler in the early stages (pre product) here.

At best it's 2.5, taking place on a two-dimensional plane with a few hundred meters of play in the third. Also, <i>everything</i> takes place at what would, even with modern military hardware, be considered point-blank range. Not only is Star Trek combat modeled on naval warfare, it's modeled on 17th century naval warfare.<p>To your next paragraph, I would point out that we are following the elite of the elite. Sisko is the officer, out of all the presumably billions-if-not-trillions of people in the Federation, who is considered most suitable to be in charge of an incredibly strategic station. Odds are he's not a typical sample of humanity, nor any other officers there. I suspect our best officers today similarly do not ""waste"" much time either.<p>Otherwise... I'm a big fan of taking canon ""seriously"" and trying to work out how it could actually be working.

When I think of the most talented and driven people I know (and surely it takes driven and talented people to make it in Starfleet), I think of people who work long hours, spend much of their spare time cultivating their talents, and generally don't waste much time. One such person whom I know actually watches Shakespeare productions for entertainment. Some particular examples strike true--O'Brien's always tinkering with things when he isn't drinking and carousing with Bashir, Bashir has an endless supply of research projects to work on when he isn't drinking and carousing with O'Brien, Odo is an introverted workaholic.<p>The prevalence of things like Shakespeare and classical music is mostly a writing conceit--it always comes off as contrived and awkward when Star Trek writers either invent futuristic forms of art or awkwardly shoehorn in the 20th century.<p>I would posit that the world of Star Trek eliminates the alienation of everyday life on Earth that leads one to social networking in the first place. Furthermore, and this is admittedly handwavy, but any analog to the internet would either only cover the station itself (in which case why bother, because the whole station hangs out at the bar anyway) or require subspace radio to communicate with thousands of planets at once, which is very plausibly impractical if not outright prevented by security requirements.<p>More nitpicks:<p>> 90s!

Jake is quite possibly the only civilian left who doesn't have anything better to do than to be a war correspondent.

Right, Quark and the owner of the Klingon restaurant are going to openly criticize the one thing that makes DS9 a tourist destination for Bajoran pilgrims.<p>> Because of this, and because of the lack of a social network, it is possible to be alone in the Star Trek world in a way which I would have to deliberately take action to achieve in my world. Even when we are alone, most of us check a number of communication vectors and leave them live--Twitter, email, text messages, Facebook, our blogs, Reddit, news feeds. We are a baby hivemind spinning our training wheels. To be alone as profoundly (to me) as Sisko, Kira, and the rest often are, I would have to make a decision to shut down all of those streams.<p>These people are living in <i>space</i>. Only the highest ranking officers have their own quarters, and the unmarried ones seem to spend half their leisure time dating or hanging out in the bar. Even the station commander's son has to have a roommate when he moves out of his dad's quarters. There's even a scene where Worf and Odo, the introverted loners of the cast, discuss their respective strategies for getting away from it all to finally spend some time alone.<p>EDIT: Come to think of it, the station does have a network. Quark is constantly hacking into it, probably with Rom's help. In one amusing scene, he does it to spam everybody with poorly produced advertisements for his bar: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-9tw2mx_gE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-9tw2mx_gE</a>",1328721443

I doubt that. As ootachi mentions, this isn't a purely technological race. Far from it. Chrome succeeds for multiple reasons, one of them of course being Chromium's engineering; however, without Google <i>backing</i> the browser heavily, it'd die.<p>You make developing and maintaining a viable Chromium-fork sound like a trivial thing, but it isn't. (Plus, this fully ignores community inertia -- shit would have to hit the fan before people ""just build chromium without it."" The community took Dart and NaCl in stride!)

In 2007, Erik Flannigan, now the executive vice president of digital media at Viacom Entertainment Group, pulled up the Google search page on a giant screen at Viacoms Times Square headquarters. He typed in South Park and took senior executives on a tour of Web sites offering pirated episodes.<p>Today, Comedy Central makes every episode of South Park, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report available free online. The efforts, Mr. Flannigan said, put a big dent in piracy. As for the television industry as a whole, Mr. Flannigan said: You might not like the windows, or that shows go up and come down, but its a far cry from where we were.<p>Still, Comedy Central shows do not make billions in syndication or in DVD sales like some TV series. The industry has been reluctant to make available shows like CBSs The Big Bang Theory, which sold for $2 million an episode to Time Warners TBS and Fox. That makes piracy a tempting option.<p>If they dont make content available where consumers are, theyre just shooting themselves in the foot, said Ron Conway, a Silicon Valley investor and the head of the SV Angel investment fund.""<p>CBS' concerns stem from the fact that if the web delegitimizes a television channel's status as the go-to source for viewers, then the whole process of the concentrated industry's livelihood, one which they have established as essential to stay afloat, let alone profit, is irreparably diminished.<p>If advertisers do not think the money they paid in the past is what they need to pay TBS now, given other advert opportunities, they will to want pay less for commercials, which support TBS' model, and would bungle up their plans. (TV Industry would go off of Nielsen ratings, which were strong estimated guesses of # of ppl/demos tuning into particular programming; this information provided Advertisers an idea of where they should their energies and money, for maximum appeal.)<p>TBS will want to pay less because they won't rake in as much from commercials, pissing CBS off since they rely upon $2 mil/episode syndication deals of their most popular properties to subsist and survive.<p>And CBS won't want to spend as much on their properties (production budgets, salaries, etc) because they will be uncertain if it will even pay off. We are past the days of Must-See TV Thursday and 30 Million Viewers for 30 mins of Friends. Sorry Burbank, they are not coming back.
----
At least Comedy Central recognizes their new competition in distribution and knew to bite the proverbial bullet and stream for free what is going to be out there for free, no matter what. Because of that, they build up brand loyalty (less and less of an influence on TV, more and more of one online) and can make money advertising -- centralizing properties, distributing, and payoff -- within the company. Establish an optional low-cost subscription fee for complete access to their library, and enough people will pay for it to justify its creation, too!<p>I am 21 years old, and hardly anyone my age watches TV. They WILL subscribe to Hulu, and they WILL subscribe to Netflix -- but look at the volume of content, and the amount of control the viewer has with those services! The television is a box of content that asks for passivity from the viewer, especially in choice availability. That does NOT work in The Game anymore.<p>Those that look to ""Remember When"" and long for systems of the past are individuals who are losing to progress, because they did not -- or COULD not, in much of Hollywood's case -- look past their at-present business models for more innovative means necessary for industry survival.<p>Now is the opportunity for independents all over to seize the unprecedented access to the consumer they now have and make a living doing it.<p>People do not care if Paramount Pictures made a movie or Uncle Regis' buddy two towns over did -- they just need it offered to them, they want it when they want it, and above all, they want it to be worth their time. Anybody can do that, and anybody can make money off of that.<p>--stepping off the soapbox--",1328721267

Vilifying or dehumanizing a group of people always leads down a path of darkness. I would not hastily blow it off as being stupid and crap said on the internet, it is a dangerous mindset, that is easily infection to those susceptible to group think and the sewers of it tend to be far too willing to act when they feel emboldened by numbers and the echo chamber.</i><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3559345"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3559345</a>",1328720924

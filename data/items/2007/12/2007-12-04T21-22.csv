86118,comment,86003,86015,0,0,corentin,,,"A bubble happens when people buy something (stock, real estate or even tulip bulbs!) that they know is overvalued, on the ground that some ""greater fool"" will arrive later in the party and buy it at a still higher price. It's a kind of Ponzi scheme; at some point, there aren't greater fools anymore and the last players lose.<p>What we see now may be some misguided investments, bad companies, etc. Obviously, all the crap will end up being cleared at some point. But it's not necessarily a bubble.",1196805270

What do you think Twitter's strategy is? It's a pretty cool idea, but I fail to see how anyone could monetize it. Does that mean no one uses Twitter?",1196803942
86108,comment,86003,86082,0,0,Goladus,,,"<i>The first bubble was a catastrophe because it involved public money. The second bubble is going to be a headache because it involves private money. But nonetheless when the value of something is way more than the intrinsic value, it's a bubble.</i><p>It's improperly termed ""A bubble"" and every time someone calls it that, it will only make the particular headache worse.  When people lose money on bad ideas, that'll hurt, but it'll happen on an individual basis.  Calling Facebook's valuation a bubble is like Chicken Little saying the sky is falling.  If enough people really start believing Chicken Little, there will be problems; but the sky isn't going to fall.",1196803686

86098,comment,83930,83979,0,0,aston,,,"Facebook's early growth was based in large part on tactical open-ups of the service. They started with just Harvard (where I'd say the ""who's got the most friends?"" game kicked things off), expanded to the Ivies and then elite non-Ivies (who desperately want to be like Harvard) and slowly, slowly worked their way down the  college eliteness scale, adding similar types of schools at the same time (northeastern LAC's in one clump, west coast state schools in another, etc). Schools who weren't added yet wanted to be in the elite club, and schools that were already in were too busy editing other people's wall posts to notice the elite factor of the site diminishing. Eventually they opened it up to all colleges, but that was probably well after they had opened it up to the colleges that actually mattered, numbers wise. The college growth sorta has buttressed the rest of the growth, since it pulls in new users as they go to college and retains old users as they graduate. <p>Meanwhile, the site's features progressed along, making the site increasingly sticky (it really wasn't back in the day). The big hitters were and still are Photos and Events, which both happen a lot better if all of your friends are already signed up for the site.<p>All of this stuff happened well before there was a lot of hype from the Valley started kicking in. Facebook's growth since opening up to high school (and later, the world) is less interesting though, since they've basically been running on network effects, inherent virality and quality product. They didn't have any of those when the site first started.",1196802541
86097,comment,86003,86003,0,0,Goladus,,,"There's a huge difference between the current growth in the tech sector (which involves a lot of ideas that are likely to fail) and the two recent bubbles of my lifetime (dotcom and real estate, which are somewhat conflated in that video as well).  The main difference is rampant speculation with people making tons of money on transactions way above reasonable market value.  Real estate and dotcom were characterized by a kind of mania.  Large, risky investments based primarily on the logic that values are surging and will keep surging fueled the inflated valuations.  When it's just Google, Microsoft, etc. making strategic acquisitions there's much less cause for alarm.  If there's a tech bubble, it's either surrounded by a thick layer of substance or it's dozens of tiny little insignificant bubbles that will burst before causing anyone any harm.<p>Facebook and a dozen imitators going public with their stock prices subsequently soaring out of control as people rush to get in on the action, that would be cause for alarm.<p>Time Magazine covers are the wrong place to look for bubble clues.

Be ready to provide supporting documentation about how you can't afford it.  And if you have competing offers from other schools that are way out of whack, mention those too.<p>Most financial aid offices will negotiate, oftentimes pretty drastically.  IIRC, Middlebury almost doubled their grant package when we went back to them, by $8-10K/year more.  I ended up going to Amherst because it was <i>still</i> cheaper, but they made up most of the difference.  (And Amherst paid for about 2/3 of my tuition outright.)<p>Colleges really, really don't want to see you get in and then fail to go there because of money, particularly if you seem very excited about them.  Particularly the better schools - many top colleges have ""If you can get in, we will find a way for you to pay for it"" policies.  They're hurting too, with the financial crisis, but if they admitted you, they want you to go there.",1231048744

My Dad's employer had a couple of scholarships that I applied for and received, and I also got a small scholarship by applying to one listed on the university's website. There are work study programs or you can get a Federal loan.<p>I worked a couple of student programmer and computer lab proctor jobs on campus to pay my rent. They were low stress, I could study on the job, and I even learned some programming. There are many options. Hell, I hear there are actually some people that ""work"" and ""save up"" to go to college. I've even heard there are some people that are successful without <i>gasp</i> going to college at all. Maybe you could build something that people here want and they'd be willing to buy something from you, but straight up begging seems silly and pointless.<p>Anyway, I'm just saying, you sound like you are freaking out (or making this whole thing up). Most of my friends didn't have help from their parents, but they were still able to get a high quality education at Univ. of Texas through some hard work, not begging random people on the Internet.",1231048584

419046,comment,418440,418897,0,0,jd,,,"Python's implementation is focused on code readability. One of Guido's initial goals was that no matter how insane the input, the interpreter must never crash. His emphasis on simple and clear code (and an intuitive bytecode) gets in the way of performance.<p>The Ruby interpreter is quite terrible, but a lot of people are trying to make it better. Give it a couple of years.<p>Also, you imply that both implementations are really naive. They're not. With languages such as Python and Ruby there is much less to gain with JIT compilation than with Java. Suppose you have this Python program:<p><pre><code>    def trivial(a, b):\n        return a + b\n</code></pre>\nWhat can the JIT optimize? The function call? Not always, because the function can be redefined during runtime (unlike with Java and .NET). Can the function be inlined? No. Can the function call frame be stack-allocated? Well, maybe, at a significant complexity cost: most scopes in Python are essentially closures so you have to treat carefully there too (upward funarg problems). Obviously the ""+"" function call can't be optimized much, because you don't know the types of ""a"" and ""b"". And even if you did it wouldn't help much.<p>Not done yet!<p>Even IF you optimize everything using the NBOCK (Non Braindead Omniscient Compiler Kit). Now you know that you're dealing with integers, and you know where the function is defined, and you know the function's definition is not going to change, and you know all function arguments can be declared locally and you know only integers will be passed to and returned from the function. Can you now transform it into a few MOV instructions? Alas, no.<p>Maybe the integers will overflow. And if they overflow you either want to throw an exception or allocate additional space and transform the integer to a heap-allocated large integer. (And you have to do all the necessary cache invalidation.)<p>So even if you are omniscient there is no low-hanging fruit. In the end even the logic of adding two integers is sufficiently complex that it warrants its own C function and inclining becomes only marginally useful.<p>When you take mundane issues such as maintainability, flexibility, and portability into account there are very few reasons left for building a JIT compiler for Python. Note that all these optimizations are viable (to an extent) with languages such as Haskell, C# and Java.",1231047905

Warning, gross.<p>""Historically, nitre-beds were prepared by mixing manure with either mortar or wood ashes, common earth and organic materials such as straw to give porosity to a compost pile typically 1.5 meters high by 2 meters wide by 5 metres long.[3] The heap was usually under a cover from the rain, kept moist with urine, turned often to accelerate the decomposition and leached with water after approximately one year. The liquid containing various nitrates was then converted with wood ashes to potassium nitrates, crystallized and refined for use in gunpowder.<p>Urine has also been used in the manufacture of saltpeter for gunpowder. In this process, stale urine placed in a container of straw hay is allowed to sour for many months, after which water is used to wash the resulting chemical salts from the straw. The process is completed by filtering the liquid through wood ashes and air-drying in the sun. Saltpeter crystals can then be collected and added to brimstone and charcoal to create black powder.[4][5][6][7][8]""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate#History_of_production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate#History_of_pr...</a>",1231047628

The author has hit correctly on the fundamental difference between the service, but veers into crazy town suggesting that changing one service kills another.

But the only other free alternative to this app was to take photos of stuff, somehow (email, iPhone sync, etc) get them on my computer, and then use some desktop image editing software to check out the colors in the image.<p>The app is much more on demand and I think it'll be fun to use when I'm doing non-brainy stuff like grocery shopping or sitting in a train.<p>More importantly, it's been really fun to write since I didn't really understand CoreGraphics before I started. I thought the app would be really easy to write since the idea is so simple but it's actually taken quite a bit of grunt work and a considerable amount of crawling through Apple developer docs.<p>I plan on sticking the app in the app store just for fun. I couldn't find an app that does what mine does for free. I think there were two alternatives, one that cost 10 bucks and was pretty sweet and one that was 5 bucks and sucked. If mine sucks, at least it'll be free! And if even 100 people download it I'll probably extend it to be able to email color swatches to people and save favorite colors.",1231047573

Part 1 basically says, if you want to run a mail server, use a dedicated IP for it.  Part 2 actually goes into the anti-SPAM technologies that will make your messages appear as non-SPAM.<p>One thing that I would add to the section on SPF: don't say that any mail not coming from your domain is SPAM.  It's a bad plan.  Use it as a way to gain non-SPAM points if it does validate, but don't say that mail not coming from your servers is SPAM definitionally.  Why?  Because more and more people are forwarding mail and most mail forwarders do NOT rewrite the chain in a way that preserves SPF.

I could never explain or rationalize that away.<p>- dealing with stressful situations and as ridiculous as it may sound, overcoming fears by using builds (changing strategies) I am not comfortable or confident with when all other plans failed.<p>But I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying that RTS games make you a smarter person.
It&#x27;s always a question of determination and willingness to work hard, as it is in any other field where you choose to work in.<p>One factor in RTS games that might help facilitate determination is infrastructure.<p>In RTS games you have the infrastructure to compete with eachother on equal terms, which you simply can&#x27;t do in many other fields you might be interested in as a kid because of barriers that prevent you from entering.",1379671093

6416810,comment,6416161,6416437,1,0,mgkimsal,,,"Couple of thoughts:<p>There&#x27;s <i>some</i> things that need to be memorized - basic multiplication tables - I memorized those (9*8, etc).  Basic articles/phrases in Spanish.  Some basic world/state capitals, etc.  But at some point memorization doesn&#x27;t get you anything any more (except passing a test, maybe) - memorizing a few basic building blocks helps for the larger problems, and eventually the truisms of the building blocks become apparent (if there are any - capitals doesn&#x27;t matter).<p>On 12 hours per day - some of the teachers I know definitely put in that amount of time, on average (grading homework, meeting with parents, planning, etc).  They may be thinking &quot;If I&#x27;m doing it, so can they&quot;, but... The teachers already KNOW their stuff - they&#x27;re not LEARNING for the most part - they&#x27;re doing the job of a professional.  The student, by definition, is not a master at any of this stuff.  A 12 hour effort, day in day out, by students, is simply going to wear most of them down.<p>This seems like a simple scheduling thing - teachers could coordinate between themselves better, individually or by subject - to stagger workloads effectively.  Foreign language may get to pile on big assignments on Mondays, Sciences on Tuesdays, etc., with an understanding of minimal homework requirements the rest of the time.  But if &quot;read 79 pages and do a one page summary of 3 topics from it&quot; is considered &quot;minimal&quot;, there are bigger judgement issues going on.",1379670907

I don&#x27;t think so).<p>Therefore, they only have to match each fingerprint against the &#x27;up to five&#x27; that it knows of. Even if your iPhone got stolen, a thief/cracker would be hard-pressed to get more than maybe 100 people to try to unlock it with their fingerprint. Again, the chances that one of those 100 would be close to your fingerprint is pretty slim.<p>The accuracy probably doesn&#x27;t need to be much better than Android&#x27;s face unlock, as the fingerprint scanner has the benefit of having something similar to a photograph, but they don&#x27;t have to deal with any lighting or angle issues (I know the fingerprint scanner isn&#x27;t a camera, but face detection doesn&#x27;t use the actual camera either, it maps your face to points and then compares those points.",1379670657

I was set 3+hrs of HW a day, but I certainly didn&#x27;t do that much.<p>First, they need to assess which teachers &quot;Don&#x27;t mind&quot; if you don&#x27;t do the homework. This could mean they stand you up in front of the whole class and shout at you, but if they don&#x27;t give you an after school detention, don&#x27;t do it. Getting in the teachers good books previously helps with this.<p>Second, if you&#x27;ve got a joke subject before one with homework due, do the homework then. Geography before Maths for example.<p>Third, have a homework team where you take it in turns to do the easily copied homework (Maths, DT, Science) and then copy each other in the mornings before school. Of course you need to cover your tracks.<p>Fourth, always cut corners. No calculator? Lol, use a calculator, but purposely get a few wrong. Use Google for everything (I didn&#x27;t have a computer until yr8). Never read a book when you can read a synopsis/ watch the film whilst playing Pokmon.<p>Fifth, work as a team at home. The parent will have to remember things from their childhood, where as older siblings only need to remember from the year before. I used to do my middle brother&#x27;s compulsory homework, whilst he did my littlest brother&#x27;s, and my mum did mine.<p>Other tricks:
Try leaving all of you books related to that subject at home one day and claim you thought it was Thursday.<p>Miss out a question at the bottom of a page, they might not even notice.<p>Pretend you are/were ill.<p>Cry<p>Hand in last weeks homework again. This one only buys you time, but works well on a Friday.<p>Tell your teacher you&#x27;ll hand it in tomorrow, then the next day tell them you handed it in yesterday and they&#x27;ve lost it.<p>Band together with the other kids in your class and tell the teacher they said the homework was due for next week, or that they didn&#x27;t even set it.<p>If you are asked to hand something in on lined paper, just don&#x27;t do a whole sheets worth. More convincing if both sheets start/end in the middle of a sentence. I&#x27;ve done this before and they didn&#x27;t even comment, I suspect they felt guilty they&#x27;d lost it.<p>Note: I successfully used all these tricks on several occasions. I would say that it definitely had no impact on my education (Got a AAAB at A level, 1st Class degree in Electronic Engineering w/ Hons), and a very significant positive impact on my life as a whole.",1379670063

Look what happened to Windows 8 which tried to forced full screen apps on 24&quot; monitors all the time.<p>The base of iOS is still the OSX kernel, which is excellent at multitasking. A new UI for multitasking on bigger screens but that is fairly small addition, given that the apps and everything in the stack can already handle this.<p>2. Phone/pads still don&#x27;t have necessary RAM to run desktop class applications. Can you imagine running full strength Photoshop on iPad yet?<p>Disruption doesn&#x27;t start with the power users, Photoshop is a power user style app, most users don&#x27;t need anything like this - think more like multiple browsers windows, a chat client, office software etc.
The Sasmung Galaxy Note III comes with 3GB of RAM. The base model Macbook Air comes with 4GB, as does the mini, as does the non-retina MBP. I don&#x27;t see a big difference in RAM here. With a 64bit ARM chips there&#x27;s no effective limit to the amount of RAM a phone could have.

People spend so much time studying the mechanics and economics of the game that eventually, pretty much every match plays out in exactly the same form. For RTS games, the build trees often get set in stone. Deviate from the one feasible tree and you might as well just be giving up because after a few minutes your opponent has just enough units to wipe you (and, since you didn&#x27;t follow the build tree, you won&#x27;t be able to counter it in time). For team FPS games, if your team gets good enough, the first few kills almost always determine the winner of the match, because whoever wins the first wave controls map flow. They control weapon drops, ammo drops, and they probably have the spawn points and probabilities memorized too.<p>I suppose there is a certain mathematical attraction in pushing a game to its limits like that.

One approach emphasises mitigating the impact of adverse events by emphasising flexibility and agility; the other approach emphasises minimising the chances that adverse events occur at all, by emphasising predictability and control.<p>In other words, do you design so you can fix it quickly when it breaks (at the expense of having it break often), or do you design it so it very rarely breaks (but when it does, it is more expensive to fix)?<p>The answer to this question not only depends on how safety-critical the system is, but how complex it is too. The prediction-and-control approach rapidly becomes untenable when you have systems that reach a certain level of complexity -- the cost of accurately predicting when failures are going to occur rapidly becomes larger than the cost of the failure itself. As the complexity of the system under development increases, the activity looks less like development and more like research. The predictability of disciplined engineering falls apart in the face of sufficient complexity. Worse; complexity increases in a combinatorial manner, so we can very easily move from a predictable system to an unpredictable one with the addition of only a small number of innocuous looking components.<p>Most forms of mechanical engineering emphasise the second (predictive) approach, particularly for safety critical equipment, since the systems are simple (compared to a lot of software) and the costs of failure are high. On the other hand, a lot of software development emphasises the first (agile/reactive) approach, because the costs associated with failures are (normally) a lot less than the costs associated with development.<p>Of course, a lot of pejorative terms get mixed up in this, like: &quot;sloppy engineering&quot;, and &quot;cowboy developers&quot;, vs &quot;expensive failures&quot; and &quot;moribund bureaucracy&quot; but really, these approaches are just the result of the same cost/benefit analysis producing different answers given different input conditions.<p>Problems mainly arise when you use the wrong risk-management approach for the wrong application; or for the wrong <i>part</i> of the application. Things can get quite subtle quite quickly.<p>One of the challenges in developing automotive ADAS systems is that a lot of the software is safety critical, and therefore very expensive to write, because of all of the (necessary) bureaucratic support that the OEMs require for traceability and accountability.<p>Equally, a lot of the advanced functionality for machine vision / Radar / Lidar signal processing is very advanced, and (unfortunately) has a lot of necessary complexity. As a result it is very very costly to develop when using the former approach; yet may be involved in safety-critical functions.<p>This is not by any means a solved problem, and very much requires detailed management on a case-by-case basis.<p>Certainly testing infrastructure becomes much more important as the sensor systems that we develop become more complex. (Disclaimer: my area of interest). Indeed, my experience indicates that for sophisticated sensor systems well over 80% of the effort (measured by both in hours of development & size of the code-base) is associated with test infrastructure, and less than 20% with the software that ends up in the vehicle.<p>Perhaps the word &quot;test&quot; is a misnomer here; since the role of this infrastructure is not so much to do V&V on the completed system, but to help to develop the system&#x27;s requirements -- to do the &quot;Data Science&quot; and analytics that are needed to understand the operating environment well enough that you can correctly specify the behaviour of the application.",1379668744

And there is always a reason for <i>why</i> it is like that, I know. My favorite example is the erase/remove idiom.<p>Anyway, here is a question about C++. Last week I tried to implement a parser for a subset of CSV - one-byte-per-character, fields separated by comma, no quoting, fixed line ending. The only requirement was speed. So I started with a simple C++-style implementation, read one line at a time with std::getline, split with boost tokenizer, copy into vector of vector of string. But it was too slow, so I reimplemented it C-style - boom, first try, 30 times faster. Through some micro-optimisations I got it 30% faster still - copying less, adding some const left and right, caching a pointer. So if anyone is so inclined, how would I make the following more C++-ish and still get the same speed?

This way you can take advantage of ready to use materials like videos, infographics and articles, add your comments and than paste the link wherever people might be interested in seeing it.

Christensen says it&#x27;s far worse: even when they do see it, fund it, prepare for it, take it seriously, they <i>still</i> can&#x27;t do it.  Factors: it&#x27;s a different emphasis from everything else they do, so it&#x27;s not only learning/adjusting, but also unlearning/unadjusting (entrants only have to learn/adjust). Specifically: the rate of releases (eg Windows vs iOS); what users value/prioritize; how they use it (tasks); how to communicate to customers (a previous positioning works against them); financial analyst expectations (new markets start small and unexciting); corporately, small and possibly-failing new markets do not always attract the best talent; and well-established corporations tend not to attract risk-takers  - and why wouldn&#x27;t such people strike out on their own? That&#x27;s often how it goes in practice.<p>Basically, like animals, companies become supremely adapted to their niche. When that niche disappears, they can&#x27;t adapt. Fortunately for Apple, the same people will probably buy iWatches, iGlasses, iWearableWhatevers, for the same purposes, the same priorities as they buy iPhones.<p>Still, cringely is right.",1379668112

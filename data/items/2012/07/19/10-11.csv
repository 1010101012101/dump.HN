You simply cannot blame it all on meat, or on eggs, or on carbohydrates.<p>In fact it's quite the opposite ... by making changes to the diet of our grandfathers, we risk a ton of negative side-effects. People nowadays drink low-fat milk, but our grandfathers were drinking whole milk straight from their own cows without problems. And our metabolism is a complex mechanism - we forget that homo sapiens were unable to digest milk, but now we digest it just fine, so it's definitely a mater of context, like culture and genetics.<p>And personally I tend to blame this all on three things - sedentary lifestyles, stress and preprocessed crap that contains sugar, with sugar being the only common compound that is partly carbohydrate, partly lipid, while also being a nutrient that our grandfathers had little access to.",1342695387

In fact, I bet most people on HN don't think that.<p>I don't think that anything is evil per se, but I do think that corporations and modern businesses are defective by design. Why are they defective? Several reasons.<p>A) They are frequently more populous than can be effectively managed (also see: Dunbar's number).<p>B) They are unethical by design since money can be made by simply throwing money in a particular direction. This make no fucking sense whatsoever. Imagine if money didn't exist and we only had physical goods. It would be the equivalent of having 100 logs, putting them on a particular patch of ground then ending up with 200 logs a week later. This just makes no sense.<p>C) The are unethical by design since the wage gap is huge and the scenario is essentially that many hundreds or thousands of people are working to make a tiny minority extremely rich. It ain't slavery, Bob, but it sure as fuck smells like it.<p>C part deux) They are unethical by design because when a worker creates something, it is by default not his. Common sense dictates that what comes from your hands belongs to you. The rules of business are such that what comes from thousands of peoples' hands belongs to one person. If there was ever a scam...!<p>D) The purpose of the business is to ensure it's own survival. A more enlightened approach would be a business which ensures the parent society's survival. This makes more sense because when an entire society flourishes, so do <i>all</i> the businesses contained in it. When a single business flourishes, other businesses and, by extension, parts of society will suffer for it. In other words, the world ain't zero sum and modern business practices do not appear to take this into account.",1342694714

These things are very easy to underestimate.  So in the end you have lots of extra bugs to fix, and you have a huge amount of tension between releasing the (buggy) software on time, letting the delivery date slip, and putting in <i>whatever it takes</i> to release something of acceptable quality on time.<p>Moreover pre-hyping releases is an incredibly easy way to get a lot of publicity for your product, so it is very common.<p>So the fundamental issue is marketing, and everything cascades from there.  But even if it isn't a normal part of development at your firm, if it happened because something major was discovered last minute and required a lot of work, would you have considered postponing your paternity leave?<p>Compare this to biotech.  Here you have elaborate licensing and safety studies (of dubious effectiveness these days) which occur between the initial product development and its release to market.  If Novo Nordisk comes up with a new drug tomorrow, they can't even estimate a release date because of all the regulatory stuff that comes with it.  So this slows the march to production down and prevents death marches.<p>So I think the issue with death marches is that they happen, not as a function of or product development, but as a function of PR and marketing, which leads to pre-hyping a specified day of release, and if you let it slip too much, you lose out on all that built-up hype.<p>So I am not saying they <i>should</i> be normal.

Your body is built to break down fats, this is why you have a gall bladder. Diets low in animal fats (not ala omega3's and 6's, which your body has to break down and consequently only gets a very small percentage of usable omegas) cause the body to more easily synthesize fat from other sources, most notably carbohydrates. Diets high in carbs trigger leptin signaling surges which can cause averse reactions like your brain no longer receiving leptin signals. ""In Framingham, Massachusetts, the more saturated fat one ate, the more cholesterol one ate, the more calories one ate,the lower peoples serum cholesterol. We found that the people who ate the most cholesterol, ate the most saturated fat, ate the most calories weighed the least and were the most physically active."" [1].<p>If you want to have the best brain function (your brain is made up of mostly fats) and body function you should strongly consider cutting out gluten based foods (which interfere with so many things in a bad way [2]) and start eating grass fed and finished beef, and wild game with a side of veggies. Cut out as many tubers as you can get away with as well.<p>Foods that you cannot eat unless they are cooked are probably not the best for your diet, in my mind this makes perfectly logical sense. We are people of the ice age, our diets for many thousands of years consisted of what could be eaten raw, including meats. While we do not yet have a full understanding of the rate at which humanity evolves; it is understood that the core functioning of our bodies energy system can not completely change in the span of a few thousand years.<p>[1] Dr. William Castilli, ""concerning the possibility of a nut...,"" archives of internal medicine\n[2] Journal: Neurology - Hadjivassiliou 2001",1342692865

4265300,comment,4264158,4265277,6,0,jaredsohn,,,"I think you misread that article.  In the most basic sense, it isn't possible for Apple to get 44% profit margin when developers get 70%.<p>Here's how I understand the argument in the article (but keep in mind the numbers are as of 2010 so they aren't current.)<p>Basically, the article is saying that Apple claimed that developers earned $1 billion through 2010.  Since developers earn 70%, the total revenue coming into Apple would be a billion / .7 = 1.428 billion giving them a profit of $428 million (matching the figure in the article).  Then the article does some estimations about how much of that $428 million goes to the credit card company and is used for processing instead of being Apple's profit and calculates that Apple only gets 44% of their 30% as profit.  (Although comments on the article suggest that Apple might be able to get more favorable deals with the credit card company than what was used in the estimations.)<p>So if you trust the article's credit processing fee assumptions, then Apple gets $189 million of the $1.428 billion which is about 13%.  And if you factor in their costs for free apps ($81 million is cited in the article), the effective percentage becomes ((189-81)/189) * 13% = 7%.<p>Edit: I'm pretty sure these numbers are the right interpretation of the article.  Somebody in the comments mentioned that the 44% should be 14% net profit since it matches some graph that I haven't seen and that seems similar to the 13% I got in the above calculations.",1342692859

4265274,comment,4265005,4265005,3,0,rubyrescue,,,"[edit - one additional point which is probably more important than the rest. if you've already done one rewrite and you're thinking of another, your problem is you probably don't know how to move the ball down the field in a business sense so you're picking up the only hammer you have - technology choice, and repeatedly swinging it. Take a step back, ask yourself if the problem is fear of the unknown, and attack the true problem - how do you get users to USE your product. If truly the answer is ""my users don't want me to use Rails"", I'd be shocked.]<p>First, I'd say I don't think you have anything to worry about.<p>Second, don't go replacing MySQL because you're worried about scale. I have yet to find a database that really <i>easily</i> scales better. You can trade a whole lot of development time to use something like Cassandra or Riak, (which are both great for particular applications). Then you spend a huge, huge amount of time building queries that were easy in Rails and you actually didn't solve any end-user facing problems. You just made it where only one of your developers actually can create queries and nobody can maintain the code.<p>Third, don't go replacing Rails because you're worried about scale. It's not the fastest thing but it's just not worth losing sleep over.<p>Just add the appropriate technology where you need it - I probably wouldn't build a recommendation engine in Ruby; perhaps that is the only piece that you build using something else.<p>Here's what we often do @ Inaka - web and admin in Rails, business ""logic"" and stuff that needs to scale (either because we have tons of socket connections or because we have a lot of data to crunch) in Erlang. (Insert Java or Python or whatever you need for the backend piece in place of Erlang.)<p>Then build an internal HTTP API that Rails can talk to. Abstract that in a model class. Have Rails call into it as needed. RecommendationEngine.recommend(...) returns JSON with the magical results for your Rails app to render appropriately.<p>Typically we give our Rails users an ""api key"" (that they don't know about) that is used to authenticate calls to the backend service, so we don't even have to share user authentication schemes between the systems. Then you can use devise or whatever you want for Rails but don't have to re-implement the same password hashing algorithms - authenticating those users is just a quick lookup in the user table.<p>Sometimes that service API may even be part of a publicly available HTTP API. For instance, imagine the backend piece exposes part of its API to mobile devices. Then, some of the methods may be authenticated and some are open to the world.",1342692159

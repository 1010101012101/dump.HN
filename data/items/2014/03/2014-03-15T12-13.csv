7404492,comment,7402571,7404059,3,0,nzp,,,"I upvoted you because I think this is an interesting line of reasoning, but I disagree that it&#x27;s a very useful one.<p>You seem to be implicitly defining &quot;computation&quot; as that which a physical computer does (machines, biological brains...).  Something that literally consumes physical resources.  By that logic, a Turing machine is not a computer and lambda calculus is not about computation.  As I said, you could spin the semantics that way but is it useful?  Does that give us useful insights?<p>Functions are not just syntactic notation.  Functions are, by definition, mappings from set A to set B.  They don&#x27;t have anything to do with notation.  &quot;cos(x)&quot; is merely a notation, yes, but not of a number but of a function.  This is an important distinction.  &quot;cos(5)&quot; evaluates to a certain number, yes, but it&#x27;s not just syntactic sugar for that number.  Not to mention that functions don&#x27;t need to operate on sets of numbers.",1394888363

It should be that your finite work is compensated for finite money during a fixed time period (in my examples, the development of the work).<p>I&#x27;d like to think you could extend plagiarism in the absence of copyright to cover all ideas - ie, you can freely modify, reproduce, or redistribute a work, as long as you aren&#x27;t falsely claiming it as your own, and upon inquiry you truthfully say where it came from.

Provisions include prohibiting Muslim men from marrying non-Muslim women, legalising rape inside marriage by declaring that a husband has a right to sex regardless of consent, and prohibiting women from leaving the house without their husband’s permission,” reports Breitbart.com.\nThe law, which has been denounced by Human Rights Watch as a violation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), would also lower the age of marriage to nine years old for girls and 15 for boys.\nDespite the fact that the law represents an egregious assault on women’s rights and wouldn’t look out of place in the stone age, you probably didn’t hear about it because self-proclaimed feminists were too busy concentrating on more pressing atrocities being inflicted upon women – such as people using the word “bossy”.\n<a href=""http://www.infowars.com/new-iraqi-law-legalizes-rape-feminists-too-busy-banning-words-to-care/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infowars.com/new-iraqi-law-legalizes-rape-feminis...</a>",1394887453

Certainly very expensive, although not <i>that</i> far from what I&#x27;ve seen in other expensive places like some parts of Sweden or the UK.<p>On the other hand, food is ridiculously cheap. You can go to hawker stalls and eat a fine meal for less than 3 €. In most European countries you can&#x27;t have a decent meal for less than 8 €. Damn, here in Spain I don&#x27;t think I can even match the price of Singaporean hawker stalls if I buy groceries and cook myself, unless if I only eat fried eggs or pasta with tomato, and in Singapore I was eating like a king.<p>Transportation is outrageously expensive if you need a car, but it&#x27;s rather cheap if you use public transport, which has a great coverage and is really good. I don&#x27;t really see much of a reason to use a car in Singapore, except if you are a car-aholic. Even if you need to go somewhere out of reach of the subway and bus network, taxis are cheap too.<p>To sum up, I would say that the relatively cheap food and transportation compensate for the very expensive accomodation, and the overall result is that Singapore is rather expensive, but there definitely are more expensive places (at the very least in the north of Europe).

7404416,comment,7403655,7403655,10,0,patio11,,,"It&#x27;s worth mentioning that hashcash has never been widely deployed for email spam prevention, and never will be.  (As far as I&#x27;m aware its widest success was getting a modest reduction in scores in the default SpamAssassin ruleset at one point, which -- AFAIK -- was eventually rolled back because, while people are attracted to the philosophy of hashcash, nobody actually uses it.)<p>Why?<p>1)  The supermajority of spam is sent through systems which can be operated by an attacker but which are not actually owned by them.  This includes, most prominently, botted-up residential PCs.  Prior to wide availability of always-on high speed Internet it included email servers which were insufficiently locked-down.  Hashcash does not meaningfully affected the economics of botnets.<p>2)  The most successful anti-spam measure in history makes direct use of a consequence of #1: since mail servers do not move in nature that much, and legitimate mail systems do not frequently mix outgoing spam and outgoing ham, you can make IP-based reputational systems.  If a residential IP starts sending email in large amounts, assume spam.  If a novel IP starts sending email, treat as suspiciously smelling ham until they&#x27;ve demonstrated sufficient history, but flip the spam bit if/when they get aggressive.  If a new MSA springs up, ensure their industry veterans at the helm understand the importance of their anti-abuse team, and tell them explicitly that their IPs are dead if they don&#x27;t.<p>This worked fantastically well.  It&#x27;s the primary anti-spam measure which protects your inbox.  (No.  I know you think Bayesian filters are.  They&#x27;re more expensive to operate at scale, are virtually unusable by the common-denominator email user, and don&#x27;t solve any problem better than IP reputation does.)<p>3)  Hashcash never caught on in part because the people who care most about spam also care most about sending billions of emails.  &quot;We make it economically unattractive to send billions of emails&quot; is a non-starter for them.  You can guess who I&#x27;m talking about by taking a look at any user database and observing what percentage of email addresses in it terminate with the top, oh, five domain names.  (Interestingly, email is a P2P protocol at the server level which is best described as &quot;All peers are equal, in that they will be equally squashed beneath the boots of our governing oligopoly if they misbehave.&quot;)<p>Note that none of hashcash&#x27;s problems are solved by &quot;And now it can be stored for later.&quot;<p>Source: My first engineering job was as an anti-spam researcher.",1394886268

7404372,comment,7403537,7404242,8,0,SwellJoe,,,"The OpenBSD fork was ancient. The only people using it were those who didn&#x27;t actually need a modern web server...which is to say, not even OpenBSD users were using it, if they were using their OpenBSD server for serious web service. While I understand the motivation behind it, I believe it would be silly to build a web service on top of an effectively 15 year old version of Apache (1.3 was first released in 1998 and was EOL, even for security releases, years ago).<p>What is also silly is for a project that has so few serious developers to take on a project as massive as maintaining a fork of a project as large as Apache.<p>When Apache had security issues that didn&#x27;t affect the OpenBSD fork it was often because the OpenBSD fork didn&#x27;t have the module in question (most security issues in Apache in the past decade have been in modules, often not frequently used ones). People not using those modules wouldn&#x27;t have had those security issues, and people using those modules on OpenBSD (after building from source to get those modules and a modern version of Apache) would have also been affected. I&#x27;ll admit that there is a certain charm to software that has few bugs because it does very little, but Apache is what it is because people need it to be those things. It is certainly not through incompetence.<p>So, my opinion may be silly. But, it is not unconsidered. I&#x27;ve thought a lot about web service for the past 15 years, as it&#x27;s a core part of my business. I could very well be wrong. Maybe OpenBSD would have been even <i>less</i> successful for web service had they opted to include a modern version of Apache. (And, before you say &quot;popularity isn&#x27;t a measure of being right&quot;, I will point out that no matter how secure software is, it is useless if no one uses it.)",1394885246

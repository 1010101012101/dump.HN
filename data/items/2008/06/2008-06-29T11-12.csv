It also makes expressing the act of copying awkward. Copying is called ""kill-ring-save"", which is a kind of terse ""kill-it-but-don't-actually-kill- it-just-copy-it-as-if-you-did"". It further breaks down any metaphoric concept tying them together.<p>I'm not arguing that ""copy/cut/paste"" are better terms because they're already used by most people, but rather because they collectively express the operations in terms of an existing, analogous, and likely familiar idea. (I think the ""ring"" part of it is perfect, though.)",1214740748

231137,comment,230778,231066,0,0,daragh,,,"The other point I made was that even if they were offering ""green"" VPSs it doesn't mean they're going to have a ""green"" and ""non-green"" power cables running in to the building and they put your VPS in the rack hooked up to the ""green"" one. They`d probably just do exactly what you can do yourself, pay someone to offset the environmental cost.<p>One of the main things about purposefully choosing ""green"" companies, often at increased cost, is that you are influencing the market based on your preference. Choosing environmentally friendly products encourages companies to offer them (I also appreciate that this is why many abuse the term).<p>Furthermore, if you wish to brand your site or company as ""green"" you should probably do a little more than choose a ""green"" VPS provider lest you further obviate the term.",1214738082

231133,comment,231040,231040,0,0,qaexl,,,"The major flaw with this article/study is that it defines wealth in terms of income rather than net worth. It would be interesting to see how much time high-income/low-net worth people spend their time in comparison to low-income/high net-worth, and high-income/high net worth. It may also be further intersting to see if there is a correlation between spending less time doing things you enjoy, and how much of the income is earned (as distinguished from passive income, such as royalties and dividends).",1214737344

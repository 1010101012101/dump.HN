We want people with strong Rails skills and who can write beautiful code, but we also really appreciate people who are good writers (substance over grammar), could communicate well with our clients if asked to do so, and have an eye for good design.  We are working with some pretty cool technology over here, which has included building out our REST API, abandoning Subversion for Git, moving to Memcached and Sphinx, etc. and there will be plenty more fun things to work on as we continue to ride on the leading edge of what Rails can do.<p>Inkling was started in Dec 2005 through Y Combinator (ycombinator.com) and in our humble opinion, our service offering, Inkling Markets, is the best prediction markets software service available today.  And it’s been that way for almost 3 years now, because it’s easy to use, runs fast, and remains reliable (full Rails test suite and Selenium to top it off).<p>We’re in Chicago, but you don’t have to be. Position also has the possibility to become full time if you’re looking for some more stability in your life.<p>To apply: 
Write jobs@inklingmarkets.com with Rails Developer as the subject.  Please send along a resume, references and anything you think would help introduce yourself: where you blog, anything open source you’ve developed, your favorite beverage, etc.",1222354366

I assumed that Microsoft was ""evil"" and Apple was ""good"". But it's far more complex than that. If this is how Apple treats developers, they deserve to lose them.",1222354258

314865,comment,314294,314677,0,0,jcl,,,"Usually, when a company makes a consumer device, they either market it as an ""experience"" or as a ""platform"".<p>When a company is trying to sell a device as an ""experience"", it finds other large companies to partner with, and makes them all sign NDAs.  The partner companies make legal agreements ahead of time so that both parties know what will be developed/accepted.  Due to the cost and limited number of partners, only a few applications are made for the device, but they are high quality.  This is the model used by game consoles and some mobile devices.<p>On the other hand, when a company tries to market a device as a ""platform"", it courts as many developers as it can, from big companies to hobbyists.  Usually, the development tools and documentation are free.  There are no NDAs to sign, no vetting process; developers create with the assurance that end-users will have access to their product, regardless of how crappy it is.  This is the model used by personal computers and some mobile devices.<p>What is unusual is that Apple is pursuing neither strategy.  They want developers to work without prior approval, but they also want to arbitrarily block distribution.  They want developers to work on their own, but they also want to keep them from talking to each other.<p>This approach is unexpected from a device manufacturer.  It was not unreasonable of the book authors to expect that Apple would have dropped the NDA by now, as it serves no purpose other than as a barrier of entry to development.",1222353687

These days, Postgres is a lot faster, and Mysql, with InnoDB, has things like transactions that make it an actual database.  I've always been partial to Postgres because it was an actual database with more features and without any of the licensing weirdnesses of Mysql.",1222353412

It's a system for ranking user submitted entries.<p>Google uses it internally every Friday at their TGIF to prioritize what questions Larry and Sergey should answer first (in addition to the ones asked in person).  All week long people submit questions or concerns and Googlers vote on them to determine if they are relevant or not. It could be used for other things too though... really anything that needs ranking. Ideas could be ranked, or you could pose a question and have the answers ranked. I'm sure there are other novel uses as well. It's a pretty general system.",1222353219

One pitfall being that Lessig's Power Point format (something he's carried over from his Free Culture lectures) glosses over what one DID as Senator, Mayor, Secretary of War, etc. These are titles (just like Major, Congressperson, VP) but the eras and jobs have changed.<p>Also, in saying that Palin is ""qualified"" or ""unqualified,"" Lessig (slyly, but brilliantly) does what he seems to rail against: classifying a political figure into a pass/no-pass binary through a series of soundbites.",1222352606

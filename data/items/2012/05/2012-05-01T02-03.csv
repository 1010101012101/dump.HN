It seemed ridiculously fast, but also seemed quite limited.  Can anyone tell me when I would use GWAN?  The description of GWAN lacked a features-functions-benefits breakdown so I wound up avoiding it because I was uncertain of its strengths/weaknesses.  That said, it's fast enough to make me wonder what other web servers are missing...",1335841197

3912794,comment,3910649,3912220,3,0,rginda,,,"I fixed a terminal ""hang"" just after the 0.7.9 version was released: <a href=""http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=chromiumos/platform/assets.git;a=commit;h=b0d9b83e670a68a1b5ee54a40a3748fc4963e811"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=chromiumos/platform/assets...</a>  This may be what you're seeing in 'bb'.<p>The difficulty interrupting something like 'yes' is a known issue.  We need to add some flow control to deal with cases where the network overwhelms the UI.  This also makes hterm appear slow when cat'ing /usr/share/dict/words, and running aafire.  A fix is in the works.<p>Yes, as you mention, automatic updates are something you already accept with Chrome.  It also seems to be the way Firefox is heading.  And Android and iOS apps.  Anyone is free to build a version locally if they really want to stick with a particular version.<p>The webstore may require an account, but the source is open.  You're welcome to build it yourself.  Or, create a throw-away account and download the CRX, then install it in your ""real"" account.<p>Of course the current version is buggy, it says that right in the web store description!  I've been working on it for a few months now, but it's difficult to get everything right in a terminal without <i>a lot</i> of users.  I fixed an issue after the 0.7.9 release that may be what you're describing, but I can't know for sure without more details.<p>FWIW, as the FAQ says, the terminal emulator and the NaCl SSH client are essentially two codebases.  Maybe you could impress people by creating a good-web-citizen version of the SSH command and combine it with hterm.<p>That would most definitely require an HTML-to-SSH relay in the middle (which hterm supports).  Then you'd have to trust that though, at which point you have to decide where you really want your potentially untrustworthy code to live.",1335841070

App stores have caught up on discovery/installation/updates, and mobile has solved the problem of not having it everywhere I go.<p>Web apps will eventually catch up on performance and maybe someday they will feel like first class citizens in any given OS rather than being relegated to mess of throwaway tabs.  We've been within 3 years of that for something like a decade, but maybe we really finally are within 3 years of that.<p>But we aren't within 3 years of having any two web apps looking similar and using familiar UI elements.  Every web app is a new UI to learn, maybe not a problem for you or me, but mobile has reached 3 year olds and 90 year olds and everyone in between, most of whom have not acquired the skill to pick up umfamiliar UIs and don't want to.<p>As for data moving to the cloud, I'm with you.

The book you mention does exist, but as graeme pointed out, it's an ""unintentional"" parody of the original phrase ""the medium is the message"", which is indeed widely attributed to McCluhan.<p>It's worth pointing out that McCluhan never wrote a book titled ""The Medium is the Message"", as the phrase is actually taken from his book ""Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man"", which was published in 1964.  I highly recommend it, if you're interested in challenging your preconceived notions of ""post-modern"" thought, whatever it is you take that to mean.  This text covers many topics seminal to media theory, which I won't summarize here, but the line you casually discard as meaningless (as well as the greater context surrounding it) is by far the most influential portion.<p>Seeing as though I explained the meaning of the phrase for you above, I won't repeat myself here, but on a somewhat lighter note I think were he alive today, he would probably be intrigued by your comments, and the medium by which you derived them.

You'd have to do that to get coroutine support anyway.<p>The idea seems so exciting and obvious that I wish I had time to do it. Lua doesn't seem to be used much for server apps, though. Why? Are there technical limitations that make it unsuitable, or is it just that it hasn't been exploited yet?<p>Another thing I'd like to know, given how embeddable Lua is,  is whether one could embed it as a browser plugin and then get the power of Lua client-side as well. Obviously, one wouldn't demand this of users, but it would be a pretty sweet option to offer: ""install this little plugin to make the program faster and more responsive"".<p>One final thought.

You would refer to documentation. Honestly all configuration files _should_ be well documented, including postgres so I don't see the issue here. Why would you want to include every single possible option, probably commented out, when you could simply grab the ones you need from the documentation? I would prefer having a lean configuration file that shows exactly what I'm using rather than 400 commented options; that's a MESS to maintain.<p>>Even still, it can be handy to exchange annotated data over the wire.<p>I cannot disagree more. It is not useful AT ALL to exchange annotated data.

Why 5 decimal places?<p>You would already know the answer before seeing the JSON file so I'm not sure why you care.<p>For instance, you're not going to be receiving JSON data over email and then putting it into a system manually. Instead, you'll have APIs that handle the JSON formats for you and simply ingest the data.<p>If you're processing a large volume of data using JSON as the interchange format, why on Earth would you want it to include comments? No service on Earth does this that has any volume of users.<p>>Also comments in config files are for many things; when file was created, change history, by whom, who to contact with problems, warnings not to edit as it's managed via chef/puppet.<p>This is not the job of a comment. These go stale and all are available via whatever version control mechanism. However, keep in mind you're talking a very specific edge case in a development environment. Typically these don't matter, at all. If you need comments within the dev system for whatever reason, you can just strip them out. Puppet would obviously have appropriate permissions so no one can simply modify them anyway without knowing they're messing with puppet.<p>Shipping items, however, should simply have documentation regarding what configurations you product does or does not support.",1335839546

I see two major problems Groupon is facing:<p>1) Limited long-term market<p>A lot of companies have had negative or even disastrous results from using Groupon. It is clear that it isn't a good option for a lot of businesses, as it can be very costly and a lot of the customers don't return. I see two viable long-term markets for the sort of deals Groupon offers: 1) High-margin businesses where most of the expenses are related to advertising, and 2) brand new businesses with a big enough marketing budget to take a one-time hit to get their name out. This is still a pretty big potential market, but I don't think it is big enough.<p>2) Almost zero barrier to entry<p>Despite being called a ""tech"" company, Groupon appears to have very little interesting technology, and there is almost no barrier to becoming a competitor. More worrisome than the national competitors (ie, Google, Amazon, and LivingSocial) are the local competitors, such as TV stations, newspapers, universities, etc.. They already have established relationships with local businesses and almost certainly have lower sales costs, plus they often don't need the margins that Groupon does and can offer merchants better deals.<p>I see Groupon dying from fighting with a thousand other fish over a pond that is a lot smaller than originally thought. National competitors like Amazon and Google that can use other aspects of their business to lower acquisition costs and/or increase the revenue per deal might have a shot at doing well in the long term.<p>I can tell you one thing - as a Google shareholder, I'm really glad they ended up not spending $5 billion on Groupon.",1335839027

3912653,comment,3912456,3912456,9,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Home automation seems to be all-or-nothing today.  I can buy a relay switch with keyfob activation for $20 at Home Depot, or I can call my local Control4 rep to come automate my mansion.  The in-between seems non-existent.  My finished basement has recessed lighting controlled by four or five different switches, all of which are in the basement.  When it's time to go to bed, one of us has to trudge down to the basement and start flipping switches.  It would make me happy to just have a nighttime kill switch -- I don't need the house to sense my presence and start turning on my favorite music.  Might be nice, but I'm not willing to spend $10K on home automation to make it happen.<p>I started reading about Zigbee and thought, ""Hey, I'll just install Zigbee-controlled switches in the same boxes where my analog ones are today.  Then, I'll use some automation appliance (like OpenRemote) to implement ""turn off all basement lights"" via a phone app""  I got confused when trying to figure out what I would need to buy, which stuff could actually talk to other stuff, etc. and gave up.<p>I'd love to see a start-up sell semi-DIY kits for people like me.  I'm fine with replacing switches, plugging in network devices, etc., but I really don't have the time to pick out appropriate hardware and make it all work together.",1335838406

There was a time when AOL was &quot;going online&quot; too. Corporate interests always go in this direction and the hackers hack around it eventually.<p>If Facebook runs a line to a village that only allows Facebook-only access, you can bet your bottom dollar that that connection and hardware will be hacked and exploited to its maximum effect, software restrictions be damned, by the very teenagers the author assumes are too stupid, ignorant, or whatever, to do it. I&#x27;d rather this be the status quo than no connection at all.<p>What we really need to be worried about is not if Facebook is going to restrict Facebook-only access with software and hardware tricks, but if the <i>local government</i> is going to back those restrictions up with guns. Send the Mexican teenagers locked down phones, sure, but also leave it up to them what they want to do with them. Somehow I doubt a Mexican village&#x27;s law enforcement is going to spend its time chasing down teenagers who are abusing their Facebook-subsidized Internet connection.<p>Who knows, maybe Zuckerberg himself will ignore this too, much like Microsoft and Adobe have never come down hard on kids pirating their software since it&#x27;s in their best interest the kids learn to hack and use their software in the long run. The Facebook-only aspect to this program may very well just be what was necessary to get the board to sign off on everything. (This is all speculation of course.)

The branching factor is extremely high (~17,000 vs Chess&#x27; 30), but each move consists of several phases where the current player can move several different pieces one after another, so I&#x27;ve always thought a modified minmax type algorithm may be able &#x27;deconstruct&#x27; each move into several nodes on a graph.<p>Whilst extremely interesting, it seems the amount of research into Arimaa pales in comparison against research into Go. Go has a branching factor of ~300 so sits far above Chess, but well below Arimaa. It is even easier to learn but harder for humans to develop an intuitive understanding of how strong any position is. It is starting to succumb Monte Carlo Tree Search [1] with games played on a smaller 9x9 (vs the standard 19x19) board.<p>However, from my perspective whilst MCTS is extremely interesting and have a wide array of applications, I&#x27;d love to see approaches towards these problems that aren&#x27;t based around an optimised &#x27;brute force&#x27; algorithm.<p>When Deep Blue beat Kasparov, Douglas Hofstadter noted It was a watershed event, but it doesnt have to do with computers becoming intelligent, adding you can bypass deep thinking in playing chess, the way you can fly without flapping your wings [2]. I somewhat feel like this criticism could be applied to MCTS and Go, and it&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether the first algorithms that conquer Arimaa come from a different perspective or not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Artificial_intelligence_for_games"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Artificial_i...</a>

Not saying that&#x27;s the case, just wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to dismiss anything. US can indeed be said that are among the most free countries, but that doesn&#x27;t really say anything without clarifying who we are comparing them with! My impression is that US is one of the least free countries by a relatively small margin when we compare them to most European countries and one of the most free ones, by a relatively large margin, if we consider the state of most African and Asian ones -but I think that if someone is even bothering to seriously make that last comparison, that alone is an indication that something is wrong in the US.",1377245123

6262294,comment,6261948,6262171,6,0,Udo,,,"I just installed AC units at home that move around 2500 W of heat energy (in and out, heating and cooling), at about 800 W energy consumption.<p>If one of those units is enough for the bus, and it&#x27;s on 30% of the time that would mean around 250 W per hour power requirement, resulting in 6 kWh over the day.<p>In a reasonably sunny environment, solar panels can get 100 W per square meter. Let&#x27;s say there are around 15 sqm available on the roof, yielding a total of about 12 kWh over the day - that&#x27;s assuming around 8 hours of sun. If that doesn&#x27;t work out due to latitude, it would be relatively easy to design panels that can be unfolded, providing extra area and serving as an extensible roof at the same time.<p>If batteries and inverter don&#x27;t swallow more than 50% of that yield, it should be enough to drive a normal AC, lighting, and a laptop, maybe even a small fridge. You&#x27;d need a backup stove for the winter though.",1377244972

For that you get... remote logging?  Configuration reloading?  Oh my...<p>Zero downtime deploys?  Is that a thing people care about?  If you don&#x27;t have server redundancy, having zero downtime deployments might be nice, but sooner or later you are going to have to reboot that machine, or you&#x27;ll deploy broken code or bad configuration.  Then what?  If you do have server redundancy, zero downtime isn&#x27;t even a feature.  Not to mention, while nginx might have zero downtime, it&#x27;s a fair amount of work to build an application that can be deployed with zero downtime.  Maybe people are using nginx as a load balancer?  If they are, and downtime really matters to them, they are seriously fucking up.<p>I expect a lot of corporations to pay this just because of some policy that they have to have support contracts in place for everything, but honestly, this is redunk.",1377244959

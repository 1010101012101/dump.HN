The stuff you remember is the stuff that you keep on using, while the stuff you forget is the stuff that was never really important. Perhaps learning a vast amount of stuff and then filtering out everything except the stuff you need to use again is the best way to fill your finite amount of brain space with useful knowledge.<p>That said, I'd be happy if my brain had retained a bit more of the undergraduate mathematics, and a bit less of the lyrics to theme tunes from 1980s sitcoms, but never mind.",1209052366

One of the huge hassles of running a blog is that when someone thinks you're wrong, they think it's their <i>right</i> to enter into a formalized duel of wits. And if the poster refuses to participate? The harasser declares victory of the most complete kind. But what people seem to forget is that the burden of proof is not the obligation to argue.<p>I don't like blogs with comments either. Usually I want to say what I want to say, and if you disagree you can email me. I may or may not entertain further discussion, but I certainly don't feel compelled to give my site over as a venue to people who then organize specious an mean-spirited conversation. They can do that on their blogs, out of my tunnel vision.",1209051618

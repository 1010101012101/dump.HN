1600776,comment,1597144,1597952,0,0,jtheory,,,"> Mom takes care of the baby, Dad takes care of Mom.<p>I'm pretty opposed to this idea, actually.<p>Breastfeeding is an obvious exception (I couldn't help much with that, though during the tricky part at the beginning I learned a hell of a lot about how to help the baby latch on), but in general I think you should be doing every single baby task whenever you can.<p>If you don't, after a few weeks your wife will be so much better at changing diapers, changing clothes, calming the baby when it's upset, taking the baby for a walk, etc. etc. that you won't be able to do it, even when she needs you to.  It'll be weird for you, weird for the baby, and you'll just get screams until Mommy comes back, and that means you'll be fairly useless when your wife most needs your help.<p>If you're working from home, dive in (this was how I did it).<p>If you are away at work during the day, then when you get home you should take over the baby as much as possible.  Change the diapers, even if you're slow & awkward at first (you'll quickly improve), give a bath (also hard at first!), dance the baby around the house and sing some songs.  And if the baby has nursed recently, do NOT just hand if off to mom at the first sign of distress -- figure it out yourself.  When the baby cries in the middle of the night, take it far away from the bedroom (once you've figured out that it's not hungry, that is), take a deep breath, and start experimenting to learn how you can calm it (it may be different from what mom does).  And actually, if you've got bigger hands and a longer reach than your wife, some of these things will be naturally easier for you anyway.<p>Trust me, you'll be a far more valuable daddy this way.",1281704101

The secret isn't any material thing.  It isn't 'who you hang out with'.  It's who you are.  If you don't like life, change yourself until you do.  Learn to enjoy things, instead of simply using them.  Learn to enjoy accomplishments, instead of using them as goals on your way to happiness.<p>I hope we aren't supposed to believe this was a real story, either.  Unhappy people don't turn around in 1 night.  You can't show someone that other people are happy and have them wake up the next morning realizing how to be happy themselves.

You might access all sites slower than I do, but the sites you access, are all accessed at the same speed.<p>So you would have no artificial incentive to visit say the BBC rather then Huffington Post.<p>But, what internet prioritization is about, is that regardless of the speed of bandwith you have, some websites will be slower and some faster. Sure, if you have a 10mb and I have a 20mb then the slower sites will be even slower to you than me, and the faster sites not as fast as mine, but that is the point.

Reading Masters of Doom right after it came out during my freshman year of high school really shaped my interests and world views for the rest of my life. The two lead characters of Romero and Carmack were so realistic and yet larger-than-life that I just knew I had to be a part of something big and relevant.",1281701509

Maybe it's the Chinese labor that's getting a bigger share of the returns.<p>But I suspect that most of the ""missing returns"" go to those that exploit weaknesses in the financial system and know how to hide their profits, i.e. investment banks, hedge funds etc.",1281701412

1600695,comment,1596607,1597197,0,0,lanced,,,"> Disclaimer #1: My job is technology evangelist for Yahoo! So refuting this is probably the definition of my job.<p>Yes, as a ""Yahoo Evangelist"", you are probably close to 100% biased.<p>> We didn't win the big prize, but we also aren't AOL, Lycos or Ask.com either. Just because we didn't become Google doesn't mean Yahoo! has failed.<p>Here's the Signature yahoo denial of reality syndrome. It's quiet similar to the surreal discussions you can casually have with YSearch people telling you that Google Search is an inferior product (or ymail beats gmail, or 360 will own facebook, ..). Basically trying to convince themselves rather than anyone else.<p>Listen, this is just like alcoholism, if you can't admit that you have a problem, you will not go anywhere. Yahoo has been steadily losing on most fronts for more than 5 years now and it is currently in the mist of a huge identity crisis. Multiple metrics can attest an AOLization process is going on! You're right by the way, Yahoo has not failed yet, neither did AOL, they're still around, just totally irrelevant ..<p>> As an engineer though PG's second point strikes me as deeply unfair. I joined Yahoo! in 2004 in the UK. The team I joined was exceptional. For a team of 30 people there were about 15 book authored by the team. I personally had written W3C standards and multi Web Standards Project founders littered the team. The rest of the team were coders, much better than I.<p>Beyond the lines aimed solely to your own glory. Does writing a book means being talented to you?<p>No more seriously, I'll pass on the rest of your post, but basically, I'm under the impression that you might be looking at things through the prism of your rather different role in that company. That sounds pretty cool to fly the world and talk about the new hot piece of frontend code written by yahoo's javascript mafia, but please realize that somewhere in Santa Clara, random Joe engineer might see Paul's analysis as an opportunity for Yahoo to wake up, acknowledge the problem and rethink itself.<p>PS: please, no ""ad-homonym"" attack!",1281701133

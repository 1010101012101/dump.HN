Not everything is an object in real life. For example, a sound wave is not an object but objects can react to it (or it can manipulate them, whichever you prefer). Maybe emphasizing this in a programming language can be done as simply as you have described it is done in go.

Profile and feed are two examples where Facebook has innovated to establish itself as a strong identity provider, and G+ blatantly copied those features.<p>I'm not blaming Google for doing that. In fact, were I in their position I would be doing the exact same thing. But it's silly to claim that Facebook doesn't innovate. I'm not sure if people are just so used to ideas like the News Feed that they don't see it, but a couple years ago Facebook created that feature and it led to an explosion of social communication on their site.<p>It's also worth pointing out that Facebook's mission statement is ""to make the world more open and connected"". If you look at their products from that perspective, I think they start more like ""Win!"" and less like ""Fail!""",1316297640

Basically we go in cycles.<p>We started with mainframes, then mini-computers and then micro-computers (PCs/Macs). What happened in the last 10 years? Through the ""cloud"" we basically went back to large computers and timesharing again.<p>Another turning point in the last 10 years is that basically any PC made since 2000 will probably be sufficient for what most normal users want. We get increasingly powerful CPUs that most people just don't need.<p>This is part of the reason for the move to lower power consumption. A smaller form factor and lighter computer is something most people care about. Having 6 cores instead of 4 just isn't.<p>Many pundits have predicted that Web applications will take over. 5-10 years ago there was a reasonable basis for this opinion. Computers would get increasingly powerful and that headroom would make the otherwise horribly inefficient Javascript medium (compared to the compiled languages like C/C++ or even the bytecode languages like Java/C#) dominant as the inefficiencies become irrelevant.<p>The rise of native apps on mobile is another example of this cycle. Part of this is that native apps have access to libraries that Web pages simply don't but part of it really is performance and the fact that performance once again matters.<p>Personally I find the manufacturing of chips at 22nm to be simply amazing. When I started paying attention to this stuff IIRC the 386/486 were done on 500nm+ lithography.<p>I do wonder what the future holds because that number just can't physically get much smaller (with current lithographic techniques).<p>It's amazing how much power a small chip can get now. I have one of the latest Macbook Airs and it can decode 10 video streams without the fan coming on. A friend has the Core 2 Duo MBA (last year's) and his machine is dying under the same load.",1316297357

Of course, you would expect it, given it's Google+ and the only reason to use it is to dislike Facebook.<p>I don't like either company.  To me, both Facebook and Google+ and all social media is a waste of time.  Instead of being a productive citizen, people are wasting their lives looking at the lives of others.  It's pretty sad if you ask me.<p>But the worst part about it is the crony fabboyism in the article.  The other part is that the comparison to yahoo is not apt.  Yahoos problem is that it doesn't have enough market share.  Facebooks problem is turning market share into profit.  They're hardly the same.  The vision argument seems like an excuse for not understanding the actual problems of the products or services.",1316297309

There you'll find lots of sysadmins in India/Russia with rates from $5-10/hour.  There's no way you or I could (or would want to) compete with that (I'm based in Los Angeles, US).  I wouldn't doubt their expertise just because of the low rate...it's just that the cost of living is much lower there.  That said, wherever you find someone, you would want to do a certain amount of vetting before you give them access to your server and network, and once you invest the time finding someone, you want to keep them around more than a few hours.",1316297276

3733042,comment,3730028,3730691,0,0,kamaal,,,"I don't know what to reply except that the very words 'process', 'interview', 'batch', 'moderation' these all exist to bring sanity and order into any system at the expense of mediocrity.<p>Like someone said ""Micheal Jordan would NOT want to be selected by YC"".<p>This means people like Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey brin, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs are not likely to come out of YC. Because the very fact that they have to go through layers of interview sessions, and then spend time performing to you, to get your attention like some performance artist performing to the king to get his attention means that is not going to happen.<p>Because people screw up in interviews. And a interview is generally no measure what the true story actually is. The guide to cracking interviews and performance is learning how to game the system. If your process is known to people outside,and they plan enough to cover all the corners and deal their cards well, they can game your interview process. That's how job hoppers who can do nothing hop around in circles of big successful companies. The situation from evaluating a 'good product' changes to evaluating 'how good the interview went'.<p>Nerds, Geeks of the best quality hate all this interviewing, playing-to-the-galleries-business. That is why they wish to build their own firm. Now if you subject them though the same bureaucratic process which they had otherwise go through in a traditional large corporate(Applying, interviewing etc) they are just going to go away, take money from somebody else and build some stuff in the same time.<p>If I would be building a business and need funding from somebody. I would go to them and explain them 'whats in it for them' and take their money.<p>But if have to go through the same large corporate styles process for this, I will be spending my time for something else. Because the very purpose my starting a business is to avoid that corporate styles processes.<p>You have to seriously ask what value you bring, or how different you are from anybody else. If you are just evaluating profit prospects(which I agree, is important), funding, taking profits back. Then really you are just another VC. There is nothing wrong with that. But that is what it boils down to.",1332302356

3733038,comment,3732825,3732825,1,0,dabogy,,,"Just to make the conversation a little more interesting, I will play devils advocate here. Maybe the issue here isn't the company, but you. I personally find it hard to believe that you can't find ""something better"" to do at a startup. There are ALWAYS things to do at startups, and just because it's not within your normal scope of work, it doesn't mean you can't work on it. If you're completing your regular work, and you want to do something more (Ie. coding), and it benefits the company, I hardly doubt founders would be against it. What it sounds like to me, is that you are lacking any initiative and are diddling your thumbs waiting for tasks to be handed to you. If that's the case, you might be better off going to a corporate setting. Another thought that comes to mind, maybe you aren't given coding tasks because you haven't proven you are capable of doing them? If this is the case, then it's an opportunity to prove em wrong. Either way, the experiences you gain at a startup are what YOU make of it. Again, what it comes down to is initiative. Take it!<p>If you do decide to leave, find a job before you quit. Your negotiating power is much greater with a job in hand.<p>P.S I know nothing about you, so just take my comments for what it's worth.",1332302275

I wouldn't feel more welcome (nor do I understand why I should feel more welcome as a result of that sort of discussion) but I don't speak for all women. I want it to be a given that a woman can be in an engineering/tech environment, and that it's No Big Deal. Making a big deal out of prejudice and fighting societal conceptions just puts me off -- if I was into that sort of thing, I'd be browsing some sort of sociology site or attending conferences on the matter.<p>While I'd love a deep, interesting discussion on the matter... I love deep, interesting discussions. Just because it's about my gender doesn't mean it's more welcoming to me. That aside, I fail to see how women would be much more likely to get involved as a result of discussion on HN -- the issues run a lot deeper than a lack of conversation on the matter.<p>In response to your later comments, I absolutely agree that the subtle prejudice is a huge problem -- but I don't know if this is the right venue to attack it, or if there even exists a correct venue or method. (Perhaps it's just a matter of time.) I do know that a sudden influx of articles on ""making women feel welcome"" and ""breaking prejudice against women in STEM"" would alienate me for one, and most certainly cause me to leave if they became of regular prominence on the front page.<p>EDIT: A good explanation of my negative feelings towards bringing more attention to the matter is the current top comment: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3732078"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3732078</a>",1332302077

Obviously this is just anecdotal evidence but a number of people I know will insist, for example, that alcohol is far less harmful and ""not a drug"" when compared to marijuana. They usually use an example of someone they know who they know uses / has used marijuana, who clearly has issues / problems in their life and say, ""see what it can do to you"", while completely ignoring X number of alcoholics all around them that have completely fucked up lives and the fact that the person they are talking about often also abuses alcohol so there is really no way to separate his / her alcohol use from their marijuana use to pinpoint which has a more negative affect.<p>The scary thing here is that basically no one in the U.S., who isn't a teenager / in college, will openly come out and say to most people, ""I smoke marijuana"", so anyone who is remotely normal / has a job, etc will only tell other people whom they know also smoke marijuana (even if just occasionally), because otherwise they are ostracized. Therefore, we have this skewed perception where only people who are either too close to someone to hide it (such as a son / daughter) or there life is messed up in such a way that its obvious / they don't care about hiding it are the ones that these people can point to and say ""they use marijuana"" as any ""normal"" person who uses it will never admit to it around someone who they know is against it or even neutral / not in favor and may actually go to great lengths to hide it as the repercussions can be extremely severe.

3732894,comment,3732284,3732284,7,0,moldbug,,,"It's well worth reading patent courtesan Gene Quinn as his head explodes:<p><i>How long will it take the Federal Circuit to overrule this inexplicable nonsense?  The novice reader may find that question to be ignorant, since the Supreme Court is the highest court of the United States.  Those well acquainted with the industry know that the Supreme Court is not the final word on patentability, and while the claims at issue in this particular case are unfortunately lost, the Federal Circuit will work to moderate (and eventually overturn) this embarrassing display by the Supreme Court.  This will eventually be accomplished the same as it was after the Supreme Court definitively ruled software is not patentable in Gottschalk v. Benson, and the same as the ruling in KSR v. Teleflex will be overruled.  I have taken issue with Chief Judge Rader’s statements that nothing has changed in Federal Circuit jurisprudence as a result of KSR, which is not technically true.  What is true, however, is that the Federal Circuit continues to refine the KSR “common sense test,” narrowing the applicability in case after case and tightening the ability for “common sense” to be used against an application.  We are almost 5 years post KSR and there is still a lot of work left to be done by the Federal Circuit to finally overrule the Supreme Court’s KSR decision.  It took almost 10 years to overrule Gottschalk v. Benson, so we are likely in for a decade of work to moderate the nonsense thrust upon the industry this morning.</i><p><i>Indeed, Breyer’s decision is the most intellectually dishonest decision I have ever read, which is saying a lot given the utter contemptuous understanding of patent law displayed by the Supreme Court over the years.  It is truly troubling that all 9 of the Justices concurred in what history will regard as one of the worst decisions in the patent space EVER!</i><p><i>Yes, Congress will be asked to step in and rectify this absurd ruling, and they should.  Knowing how the legislative branch operates I cringe at the thought of  Congress coming to the rescue.  The only thing that gives me solace is that the industries summarily executed this morning have an A+ lobbying game, which in Washington, DC means everything.</i><p>(<a href=""http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/03/20/supreme-court-mayo-v-prometheus/id=22920/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/03/20/supreme-court-mayo-v-pr...</a>)<p>The worst of it is: Quinn is exactly right (about the Federal Circuit, in every way an organ of the patent lobby).  The Supreme Court is simply not in control of our foul, meretricious patent bar.  (Of course, if they wanted to start getting in control of it, they're doing it right.)",1332299146

Finding another job is tough as it is - and your bargaining position, perceived 'employability' etc are greatly diminished when you're applying without a current job.<p>You have an idea of what makes a great job. Go look for it. Believe that it exists - and when you <i>really</i> believe it exists, you will feel energized about the prospect of landing the job.<p>So start looking for a job right now - and whenever a prospective opening comes along, dive into it.<p>A lot of job seekers don't ask enough questions before taking up the job. The interviewee asking many questions is always a good sign for any sane interviewer. Make sure you know and like what you get into next.<p>After you've put your resume out there, sent emails to companies and are waiting to hear back, do two other things to make the immediate future better.<p>1 - Do what you can to make life at your job more interesting. Seek out changes and improvements to your job and for your company even if it takes convincing someone else to 'allow' you to do it.<p>2 - Find habits or interests outside of work. This could be activities can be added directly your resume (for example if your company works on Java, you could learn to work on node.js), or even something unrelated to your career like sky diving or visiting landmarks over the weekend (I am a programmer, and I read up on finance to take a break)<p>Good luck.",1332298835

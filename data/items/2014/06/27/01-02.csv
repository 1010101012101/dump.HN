I have something that works, but it&#x27;s really jerky, and doesn&#x27;t accelerate properly like yours does. Thanks again for this awesome site!",1403834382

7952418,comment,7951803,7951803,4,0,daniel-levin,,,"The Massachusetts police have privatised part of their operations. And the &#x27;general counsel for the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association&#x27; has said that they&#x27;re immune to information requests because they&#x27;re private corporations. The article positions the purpose of the privatisation as secrecy. This seems like a very Bad Thing, so it&#x27;s not surprising that the ACLU have stepped in.<p>But I&#x27;m going to play devil&#x27;s advocate, because I want to know the truth:<p>I wonder if there are other, possibly more important reasons for forming these private corporations. Maybe the existing police system doesn&#x27;t function optimally, and provisioning resources (such as trained officers with appropriate equipment for drug busts) is a process that&#x27;s too slow, or inadequate. Maybe this is a way of detouring the bureaucracy and systemic bullshit that encumbers civil servants whose job is ultimately to keep people safe.<p>The article says that Tewksbury, MA paid $4600 for membership to NEMLEC. That town has a population of around 28 000. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for a small town like that to have a police force with a dedicated SWAT team, computer crimes unit and schools incident response team. It also doesn&#x27;t make sense for a larger jurisdiction to serve the smaller community when it [the smaller community] needs it, and get nothing in return. It seems as though it&#x27;s a way for police departments to share resources. I&#x27;d imagine that if a small town&#x27;s police department found themselves unable to deal with a time-critical scenario, like a shooter in a school, they&#x27;d call in backup pretty damned quickly. Perhaps the quality of response a small town could get through NEMLEC would be better than going through traditional police channels?<p>To me it seems like the primary purpose of forming these private NPCs is not secrecy. As the article says, government police agencies already do that - &quot;police agencies have broadly interpreted open records laws to allow them to turn down just about every request.&quot;<p>So, if it is actually easy for police agencies to turn down requests in the first place, why go to all the effort to form, finance, and manage a 3200 member [1] corporation?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nemlec.com/who.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nemlec.com/who.htm</a><p>edit: clarified a sentence by adding &#x27;through NEMLEC&#x27;",1403833306

What about the functionality? Ah... well. It&#x27;s not there. But as I&#x27;ve wrote.. I was not able to get some reliable hardware widget that displays the information gkrellm provides. It was cumbersome to adjust the seperate network/cpu/disk widgets on the desktop and the information was rather useless and barely readable. I hate to say it but this stuff worked with SuperKaramba on 3.5...(<a href=""http://netdragon.sourceforge.net/ssensors.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netdragon.sourceforge.net/ssensors.html</a>) and well I don&#x27;t know why I care soo much about it.. it just feels backwards having to fight with all this stuff while remembering how well it - at least from a user perspective - once worked.<p>Disabling the Desktop in a folder is the first I&#x27;m doing when on a new system with KDE. I can see how it is useful to have multiple folders accessible on your desktop but I can also do it with the traditional Desktop and widgets. Never felt the need for it - but there are a lot of different use-cases.<p>Activities are a great idea in theory. But the implementation got stuck halfway before being really useful. I would love to have a usable version of that and lot of use cases for them e.g. monitoring and terminal stuff in one activity / IDE in another and another one for the browser/mail stuff.. but it never felt right and I was not able to pull that off. It also seems like the programs in each activity do just stay in memory and not really separated... so it&#x27;s some good idea that is probably really difficult to get right.. okay. No problem with that, but the thing that annoys me a little bit is that they feel so forced upon me. If I don&#x27;t want to use them they should be to able to configure away completely - remember - I can even rotate my widgets.. ;) as they are unrelated to virtual desktops in KDE (at least that was my conclusion after spending time with them) and only annoy me...<p>I could go on.. and basically these small little things are what I would say is bad design.. however I can see how difficult these things are and how diverse the opinions are on these debates. But I have the impression that nobody is really happy and as long as there is little improvement in these areas I&#x27;m not really excited about QML and mobile stuff..<p>I still think that the majority of KDE users are running Linux on older machines for doing programming and office work and well... nobody seems to really care about this anymore.

My parent&#x27;s business when I grew up needed lots of reasonably skilled, but cheap labor. Turns out you can hire from two possible pools of labor for this: recent immigrants and ex-cons. If you just want cheap labor you hire young people.<p>For a while, in the early 80s, my parents hired young people, until the work they took on required people with more skill. Then they hired immigrants from South East Asia under some kind of asylum/placement program. I don&#x27;t remember the details, but their shop was pretty multicultural for a long time. Eventually that program ended and they started mining the pool of ex-cons. Mostly guys with minor drug offenses and non-violent offenses.<p>They kept putting that pool of people to work for probably a good 15 years and I grew up working in the family business, side-by-side with them. One thing I learned is that you start to not think of prison as the end of the world.<p>It&#x27;s supposed to be a BFD to go to prison, a life breaker. But here was a bunch of guys who did their time, and all had jobs and did well enough for themselves and their family. So it just seemed like virtually the same to young me as when people I knew in the military were shipped off for a tour or a long deployment somewhere. Granted, I wasn&#x27;t entirely aware of the social stigmas attached to their incarceration at the time. But you can imagine being their friends or kids or what have you growing up with a father having served time.<p>Every once in a while, one of the guys would slip up and get caught doing cocaine or something and do a year in prison. After he got out, if my parents had an opening, they&#x27;d hire them back. From my pre-teen perspective it seemed virtually the same as being a soldier, bad pay included.<p>Once I got older and stopped working in the family business, the social stigma attached to incarceration was kind of a shock to me. It took me a long time to realize why these guys were working at my parent&#x27;s place instead of the same kind of shop down the street for more money. It&#x27;s that the other shop simply wouldn&#x27;t hire ex-cons and my parents didn&#x27;t mind/thought they could save the company some money hiring these guys at $.50 less per hour than a stand-up citizen (while also helping them get reintegrated back into society).",1403832535

Many established and well-respected developers argued against relational data, because they said &#x27;it splinters all of the data&#x27; and modular programming &#x27;splits up the application logic all over God-knows-where&#x27;.<p>Some people still argue if Linux and it&#x27;s monolithic kernel is better or worse than Windows modular design. These are two completely different architectural schools, and yet both have people who consider one good design, and the other flawed beyond repair.

Assume some piece of code works, technical debt is only an issue if that code ever needs to be modified.  Financial debt is always an issue regardless of what happens, even if you die.<p>2.

It&#x27;s freaking ancient, to the point where the emulated version uses the mouse input to emulate the &quot;light pen&quot; [2] from the original system, which was used because the mouse barely existed at that time. The thing uses 4-letter terminal codes to access every function. Oldschool.<p>Our employee distribution is quite significantly skewed towards the older generations. Compounding it, many of the people who interact with it tend to be trade-staff who started in workshops then climbed their way into being semi-technical admin (roles such as fleet planning, etc.). It works, but the mind boggles when you imagine the degree of time wasted every day by these guys because they don’t have any sort of significant batch processing capability.<p>In the course of doing my work, I was exposed at some point to ODBC drivers for the database. I managed to get some credentials used for running reports against it (I think I found another reporting query with them saved in the file and ripped them out of it) which that allowed me to arbitrarily query the database. From that, I started to automate a great many things - for example, where previously a yard coordinator would type in the code to query each storage road individually in his maintenance yard to see what he had around for the day’s work, I gave him a 1-click query for doing the same job.<p>Our maintenance database was a similar affair, except that it runs Oracle and is a little less antiqued. It also has a windows-native GUI but it is similarly lacking in many batch processes.<p>A more recent example that I tackled is that <i>every single morning</i>, a yard coordinator would work out which groups of vehicles would be coming in that day and were due for their roadside inspection (info from the operational database). He would then print out a list of these (literally on paper, next to his keyboard) and manually enter each vehicle, 1 by 1, in to the maintenance database to check whether they were then due for their yearly scheduled maintenance before their next roadside inspection. If they were, they&#x27;d be flagged for dragging in to the workshop. This took him approximately an hour, every single morning of his work life, and that would then be summed up and presented at his morning planning meeting.<p>He’d asked the guys who normally support this sort of stuff, but had got nowhere in about 7 months because it sort of fell between “fully-fledged IT department that can do this easily but comes with bureaucracy” and “guy who kind of knows how to develop database queries, but doesn’t know how to query 2 different databases in the one query” and so it never got anywhere. I was on site one morning for some unrelated work and saw him doing this. When I asked about it, I told him to give me some time and I’d come back to him and proceeded to write a query to do it in one click.<p>I’ve been doing this sort of stuff for about 3-4 years now and have a (good) reputation amongst the maintenance, operations, etc. guys now. The problem is that IT tend not to support them, as it tends to be more effort spent on bureaucracy than the task at hand. Furthermore, the guys don&#x27;t know who to talk to in order to get this stuff done / don’t know any better, so they just deal with it and do it by hand.<p>In the end, I guess I did get noticed by middle management because I&#x27;ve now been tasked with being the lead on developing/acquiring a next-gen operations business intel solution which will draw together all the disparate bits of data we gather and put it to better use, so that&#x27;s cool.<p>I guess my take-home message is that many of you guys work in the IT space in technology companies. You tend to be exposed to people who <i>just get</i> this stuff and so it all just happens. There&#x27;s so so many more companies out there though, particularly established ones running operations (think mining, transport & logistics, the army as per the OP, etc.) where this stuff simply isn&#x27;t done and it&#x27;s a completely different world. They tend to have a distrust of &quot;IT&quot; because their experience with them is the bloated bureaucratic mess that is many corporate IT departments. IT in large, non-high-tech corporations can also be the sort of place where a problem either is too small to care about, or significant enough that it warrants a legion of SAP/Oracle DBAs and a whole heap of project management to develop a “solution” over a 12+ month period.<p>There is an astounding amount of potential for someone who <i>gets</i> operations / the guys on the coal-face, and can bring high-tech solutions to their problems rapidly. They will quite literally treat you as some sort of wizard who has mastered the arcane forces if you do this, because you deliver a solution that is otherwise unattainable in many situations. Your business impact is huge because you cut out a whole heap of otherwise wasted time, which is a direct benefit to the bottom line.<p>The major challenge IT has is bridging this gap. I’m not quite sure how you go about leaning yourself down enough whilst still appealing to the more rigid constraints of “IT in a big corporation” but I am convinced that there is no end of value to be created in this area.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pen</a>",1403831043

Wish me luck. I am submitting my battery draining app. By the way do you know how Samsung Touchwiz manages to heat up my phone? It is an awesome feature and it seems to be unique to Samsung because I could not find the function the Android SDK! Can you believe that?! Ha!<p>I really look forward to winning the new Galaxy Note as I compared it to a bunch of other Android phones and it seems that it not only offers the best hardware but also the biggest surface for heat dissipation. I have a cold currently and can&#x27;t stop thinking about how awesome it would be if I could use my cell phone as a portable hot-water bag. 
That reminds me of a story about Samsung and illness: 2003 I had a heart attack. I was so shaky and panicked that instead of the emergency services I dialed the Samsung hotline. 
I got to speak to a support agent instantly! He calmed me down and explained to me how there is a secret resuscitation function built into my current Samsung phone then he hung up. As my heart rate came to a halt I yanked up the vibration strength in the settings menu and with his callback a powerful electric shock ran through my body giving my heart the much needed kick to start beating again.<p>As I thanked him he explained that this function was not openly advertised because Bill Gates had a patent on breaking bones through muscle contractions caused by an electric shock for using a Linux product. But because the implementation was too similar Samsung hid the feature.<p>Beat that Apple!",1375369196

There&#x27;s a whole spectrum of technical skill that&#x27;s being ignored.  All software testers are using computers to do their work, and they are all using tools to make them more effective.<p>I think this tool sounds really interesting and would allow a tester to generate lots of interesting tests.  It could conceivably also speed them up, which is great, and it could allow for automated regression testing of touch features, which is also great.  That doesn&#x27;t really mean anything with regard to who is using the tool.  You don&#x27;t have to become a full-time developer to learn to use Selenium for tasks where it makes sense, and I assume that this tool is the same way.

Not big bombs, mind you, just enough to kill a few dozen or a hundred people each.<p>By the strategy seemingly being argued for here, a &quot;resilient&quot; or &quot;rational&quot; America would just let the existing police do their work as best they can, maybe with some not-<i>too</i>-expensive Federal assistance, and simply accept the added risk of dying at major events, which, after all, is not that much more significant than the risk of dying in a car accident on the way.<p>Obviously, that is <i>not</i> the response we&#x27;d expect, and it&#x27;s not because Americans are irrational or fearful. It&#x27;s because this prioritization-by-mortality-rate policy logic is faulty. It <i>matters</i> that there&#x27;s an agency behind these deaths.

If A invests 10 million in a technology, and B just copies it, B can undercut A on the market because it doesn&#x27;t have to recoup R&D costs in the price. That leads to companies underinvesting in expensive R&D, because the winning play is to copy, not invent.<p>For most software patents, the capital cost is almost nothing. Even if it took a programmer a whole year to invent something, that&#x27;s like 100k--no money at all in the larger sense. So it makes no sense to protect a capital investment that&#x27;s negligible.<p>That said, the article really fails to explain why lawyers don&#x27;t want to have a categorical exclusion for software patents. Usually, you want a legs principle to get to the root of why something is bad, not address bad situations ad hoc. Why are software patents bad? Sequential innovation, as mentioned in the article?

You can take advantage of static initializers to do your function pointer poking for you instead of having to manually do it all in main() or some other point of initialization, potentially creating other physical dependencies. (As long as no other static initializers depend on the function pointers being in place, because order of execution is not guaranteed.) e.g.:<p><pre><code>    extern &quot;C&quot; {

In order to safely merge all those definitions into one, the engine would have to know:<p>* That the function in question never accesses anything in its closure that could be different for each construction<p>* That hasOwnProperty() is never called on the object to check which way the method is declared (alternatively, remember that it had done this optimization, and spoof the return value)<p>* That the function is never used as a constructor. Otherwise, Person could update sayHi&#x27;s prototype and wind up changing its effects for all Persons, where it was supposed to create a customized inner class.<p>And if you think any of these are easy, remember that you can get a pointer to that function via the following:<p><pre><code>  var a = &#x27;say&#x27;, b = &#x27;hi&#x27;

The programs that can be sped up by SIMD are a subset of the programs that can be sped up by VLIW, are a subset of the programs that can be sped up by OoO engines.  Of course, SIMD has a big advantage in instruction bandwidth vs VLIW, and if you&#x27;re already going OoO the SIMD instructions only use up a minimum of the OoO engine&#x27;s resources.

Sorry if I sounded harsh :)<p>I understand you didn&#x27;t intentionally mean to be dogmatic, I probably could have worded that more appropriately. But I think it comes across that way because it&#x27;s unintentional. That said, it&#x27;s not as though every piece of advice came across that way. And again, I want to emphasize I&#x27;m attacking the advice stated in that way, not you, because you didn&#x27;t apply this blanket to every piece of advice.<p>If you believe Tarsnap fits into your own definition of augmenting the human condition, then I suppose I can&#x27;t argue that. But taken at face value, the original statement appeared to strike a chord with a number of commenters and myself because of the implicit scale - if you ask which companies augment the human condition, I believe most people would respond with companies on the scale of Apple. Small, almost <i>boutique-level</i> startups are very successful without this level of grandeur.<p>But again, I revise my original criticism if the definition of impact is broadened, like you just clarified.<p>As for pizza shops - I can see how your advice encourages appropriate behavior, and I agree to that. But I also believe that (and this wouldn&#x27;t be your fault) it can also encourage &quot;easy exit&quot; mentalities where people just copy a fad and tweak it for success.",1376467139

It&#x27;s tough to absorb these sorts of generalities though, which is why startups make the same mistakes over and over again... not because they haven&#x27;t heard the advice, but because it&#x27;s hard to apply.  I&#x27;d love to see, over the next 57 weeks, the author take one of these per week and tell a real story about how he learned it.  An example: &quot;Your authority as CEO is earned... don&#x27;t try to use authority you didn&#x27;t earn.&quot;  When did you learn this?  You certainly didn&#x27;t think before &quot;I should use authority that I haven&#x27;t earned.&quot; So how did it stand in your head before, and what experience made you rethink it?

Note: the same argument also applies to other companies avoiding the GPLv3, which would explain
why clang&#x27;s website uses gcc 4.2 in its comparison.
Though people here mentioned the GPLv3, no one noted that 4.2 was when the gcc license switched to it (I checked the HN comments).<p>FWIW I&#x27;ve seen a GPL project eventually lose out to a BSD-style competitor, and the latter were surprisingly nasty about it, similar to what you&#x27;re saying. This might be due to commercial interests vigorously supporting the BSD-style version for reasons of MONEY. But apart from nastiness, it makes sense that a more permissive license, being free to a wider audience, will be more popular. OTOH perhaps here, for a compiler, requiring people to give back (GPL) will work better?

The problem is this: adding &quot;but if you really need that kind of privacy, [you&#x27;re screwed]&quot; doesn&#x27;t change the meaning of &quot;if you have something to hide, you must&#x27;ve done something you shouldn&#x27;t be doing&quot; and that is still utterly, UTTERLY narrow minded.<p>(2) The terrible, terrible naive argument is made a lot today by all kinds of people (even by my own father, who is generally a huge role model for me), making my criticism of it, unfortunately, quite relevant towards today&#x27;s spying of the US government. Even if Schmidt HAD added nuance to take away my criticism of what he said -- which he either didn&#x27;t, or I haven&#x27;t found it --, it would&#x27;ve stood as a more general criticism. I&#x27;m not convinced that Schmidt doesn&#x27;t still stand by what he said back then, but it can&#x27;t be too hard for him to make a statement if he feels his views have been improperly represented by the media. If he has, I would love to know about it. As it stands right now, I just cannot have private communication through any service which Google provides, and that means I actually might have to be careful about what I write, and THAT is very wrong in my opinion.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/07/google-ceo-on-privacy-if_n_383105.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/07/google-ceo-on-priva...</a>",1376465975

That&#x27;s not to say I&#x27;m attacking his tone instead of the advice, but I don&#x27;t think the advice is valid because it comes from a place of dogmatic declaration (I understand he has a lot of experience, but I don&#x27;t think some of these subjects can <i>have</i> absolute statements said about them).<p>Take this one, which other commenters have mentioned already:<p>><i>&quot;If it doesnt augment the human condition for a huge number of people in a meaningful way, its not worth doing.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m going to say this is not only blatantly false, but just bad advice and nothing but discouragement.<p>&#x27;cperciva&#x27;s startup, Tarsnap, is not something I&#x27;d say &quot;augments the human condition for a huge number of people in a meaningful way&quot; - it&#x27;s Colin&#x27;s full-time job, and I personally think it&#x27;s fantastic, creative, and genuinely useful to his client-base.<p>But apparently, it&#x27;s not worth doing because it doesn&#x27;t &quot;augment the human condition.&quot; (I don&#x27;t mean to involve you, Colin, it&#x27;s just a relatively well-known example on HN).<p>Let&#x27;s see...&#x27;patio11. His most recent startup, Appointment Reminder, <i>might</i> fall into the category of augmenting the human condition. Does Bingo Card Creator? Maybe I&#x27;m reaching here...but no, probably not. Was it not worth doing? Absolutely not. (Again, same to you Patrick).<p>Then we have this tidbit:<p>><i>&quot;Pick new ideas because theyve been made possible by other social or technological change. Get on the train as early as possible, but make sure the technology is there to make the product be enough better that it matters.&quot;</i><p>This encourages the stream of, for example, crappy camera apps that currently saturate the app store. A lot of developers got on the train, but giving this kind of advice will probably (as history suggests) make founders <i>believe</i> they have the technology to genuinely make a difference in a highly saturated market.<p>On the other end of the extreme:<p>><i>&quot;Dont build something that already exists. Customers wont buy it just because its yours.&quot;</i><p>If you do get on that train early, and you can genuinely innovate, or just plain reverse-engineer at a lower manufacturing cost, by all means do it. That&#x27;s a good starting recipe for profit.<p>><i>&quot;Pick implementations that give 80% of the benefit with 20% of the work.&quot;</i><p>The 80/20 ratio has cropped up everywhere and grown in popularity for a while now, but I think it&#x27;s too vague. In particular, I believe this advice would encourage the wrong kind of behavior. It could be interpreted as being efficient, or it could be interpreted as foregoing the more rewarding, effort-filled path with the one that&#x27;s only marginally useful but exponentially easier. Risky absolutes for advice.<p>Finally:<p>><i>&quot;If you cant get to ramen profitability with a team of 2  4 within six months to a year, somethings wrong. (You can choose not to be profitable, but it must be your choice, not something forced on you by the market).&quot;</i><p>Maybe Slava successfully did this, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to hold all startups to this bar.<p>I also don&#x27;t think things like being a &quot;final say&quot; CEO are fully compatible with evenly splitting stocks. This is a very highly debated part of startup financial management. So, yes, this is my opinion, but equally importantly, the opposite advice is also <i>Slava&#x27;s opinion.</i><p>Now, on the other hand, a lot of these statements are really good. I&#x27;m not flaming the entire post. In particular, I liked:<p>><i>&quot;Product sense is everything. Learn it as quickly as you can. Being good at engineering has nothing to do with being good at product management.&quot;</i><p>Yes, very true, and something you have echoed before as well, pg. Running a company in any sense of the term is completely different from engineering a company&#x27;s product.<p>><i>&quot;Learn the difference between people who might buy your product and people who are just commenting. Pay obsessive attention to the former. Ignore the latter.&quot;</i><p>Often stated, definitely true, also applies to investor courting.<p>My personal favorite:<p>><i>&quot;Morale is very real and self-perpetuating. If you work too long without victories, your investors, employees, family, and you yourself will lose faith. Work like hell not to get yourself into this position.&quot;</i><p>This is one of those murky, non-actionable truths of startups that you don&#x27;t really <i>get</i> until you&#x27;ve tried it. Judging from the &quot;I failed&quot; Ask HN: posts, I think this might be one of the least expected but extremely true ones. I might even say that for personal well-being, this might be the most important piece of advice.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be downvoted for this, but I would ask people to at least explain why they disagree so we can have productive discussion. I respect the OP, I&#x27;m just expressing my disagreements here.",1376464895

I&#x27;m not sure a great understanding of a desktop PC is going to change this.<p>If you define &quot;what they need to know&quot; as &quot;what&#x27;s necessary for vaguely close to optimal job performance&quot;, then no, they won&#x27;t. They will know the minimum they can get away with. They will know as little as we let them know. It has always been this way. The USA was founded by some of the brightest men of its day because the prevailing view demanded that this be so. Today, we do not demand that our leaders be our best and brightest. We have no idea how we would go about measuring such a thing. Instead, we&#x27;ve been taught to support the candidate that fits our preset ideological subset. This leads to parrot leaders who do not think strategically about the management of a country as much as they think strategically about the appeasement of their sources of votes and campaign contributions.<p>It comes back to understanding the basics of asking good questions and thinking about one&#x27;s surroundings. This process is what humans did well to succeed: we should be encouraging it as much as possible. I do not ask that the average person, or even our decision-makers, already know how to re-install an operating system. I ask that they know how to find out, and think about the problem well enough to gather information and come to a conclusion about what&#x27;s wrong. I ask that they look at the world rationally and scientifically. This is the failure of our educational system. Because we have not taught basic thinking and reasoning skills, because we have not taught that this is fundamentally necessary as a basic part of being a human, our leaders will say things like &quot;The internet is a system of tubes&quot;. Because we do not expect or teach our citizens to think rationally, because we do not expect and verify that our leaders are informed about the mechanics and consequences of the decisions they make, bad laws are passed with great frequency.<p>This is our cultural, educational, and societal failure. No, I don&#x27;t expect everyone to know how to re-install Windows. I expect them to look around them and see if they have any resources to get closer to a solution before expecting a free fix. And if they decide it&#x27;s not worth their time to do it on the regular, I expect them to conceptually understand it on a basic enough level to provide information when asked probing questions by the person they&#x27;re paying to fix it. Think, then act. It&#x27;s not hard, we just gave up on teaching it.",1376463859

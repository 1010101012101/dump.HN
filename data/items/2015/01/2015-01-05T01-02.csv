This is something right out of Jane Jacobs&#x27; &quot;Eyes On The Street&quot; idea from &quot;The Death And Life Of Great American Cities&quot;:<p>> “A city street equipped to handle strangers, and to make a safety asset, in itself, our of the presence of strangers, as the streets of successful city neighborhoods always do, must have three main qualities:<p>> First, there must be a clear demarcation between what is public space and what is private space. Public and private spaces cannot ooze into each other as they do typically in suburban settings or in projects.<p>> Second, there must be eyes upon the street, eyes belonging to those we might call the natural proprietors of the street. The buildings on a street equipped to handle strangers and to insure the safety of both residents and strangers, must be oriented to the street. They cannot turn their backs or blank sides on it and leave it blind.<p>> And third, the sidewalk must have users on it fairly continuously, both to add to the number of effective eyes on the street and to induce the people in buildings along the street to watch the sidewalks in sufficient numbers. Nobody enjoys sitting on a stoop or looking out a window at an empty street. Almost nobody does such a thing. Large numbers of people entertain themselves, off and on, by watching street activity.”<p>I love it. Simple, elegant.<p>Would love to hear if anybody has any divergent thoughts about how this sort of p2p peer-surveillance/protection mechanism works in other complex systems!",1420422807

8836725,comment,8835312,8836179,0,0,spion,,,"TypeScript over Flow<p>* The language service is superb (and will soon have a documented API). Just try the playground: <a href=""http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/</a> or Visual Studio. Flow has some sort of open tooling, but its comparatively poor for now (e.g. its autocomplete rarely gives suggestions, needs to be augmented with other tools)<p>* You can actually export types. Flow lets you do it, but jstransform generates code that throws at runtime (<a href=""https://github.com/facebook/jstransform/pull/54"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/jstransform/pull/54</a>). This is really annoying and makes Flow unusable for any serious production work right now (for me)<p>* You can declare modules that are just functions. Flow only lets you declare modules that contain things. This is also annoying and makes Flow unusable with many modules on npm aswell. TypeScript on the other hand has excellent support for <i>all</i> of the following: AMD, CommonJS and object (namespaced) modules. Modules are a bit confusing and rigid and take some time to figure out though.<p>* Passing all compilation units to the compiler rather than working inside an entire folder based on a config file is a lot more flexible.<p>* Boudned generics. TypeScript lets you add restrictions to your generics e.g. `interface Set<T extends Eq> { ... }`. Afaik flow doesnt have them yet.<p>* Faster, more open development. Compare TypeScript&#x27;s daily commits, code reviews and pull requests with flow&#x27;s monthly code-dump (&quot;sync changes to upstream&quot;)<p>* Doesn&#x27;t pretend its not a compile-to-JS language. Flow is being marketed by Facebook as JavaScript but it isn&#x27;t (maybe they want to avoid being bashed by the coffeescript-hater crowd? having strong type inference does not a JavaScript make) TypeScript clearly states its a compile-to-JS language. Both are pretty much the same thing in this regard.<p>Flow over TypeScript:<p>* Much sounder type system. Null and (most) undefined values are properly modeled. Generics don&#x27;t have weird behavior [1] in some cases. This is truly the best thing Flow has over TS.<p>* Product types. TypeScript only has function product types (overloads), Flow also supports product types on objects, which is really useful given the nature of JS objects (e.g. lets you model lodash.extend properly)<p>* A couple of extra ES6 goodies (e.g. destructuring). TypeScript will be catching up soon though.<p>* Much better type inference. In typescript types stop flowing through functions that are not arguments to function calls. In flow they continue to... erm, flow, so its possible to write most of your module without using any type annotations whatsoever. Now, this might sound like its important, but in practice its not <i>that</i> important - its best to annotate all functions with types anyway as error messages soon become confusing or misleading otherwise (the line where an inconsistency occurred is much further away than the place with the actual error)<p>* JSX. I find this not-so-useful to be honest, especially with the newest strongly-tied-to-React incarnation of the JSX compiler which is a lot less nicer than the older compiles-to-function-calls version. Though its really nice to have typechecked HTML-like templates, I suppose.<p>Even more info here:<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1265"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1265</a>",1420422297

I eventually realised that recursive descent was much simpler, and with things like the &quot;Let&#x27;s Build a Compiler&quot; articles everything became so clear and it felt like all that theory I learned before was mostly useless. I think the fact that top-down parsers are theoretically less powerful doesn&#x27;t make much difference in practice; and the trend of compilers (in C at least) now seems to be to move <i>away</i> from generated parsers and to recursive descent.<p>Big, &quot;production quality&quot; compilers like GCC and LLVM use RD, and so do small ones like (o)tcc and various others&#x27; &quot;toy compiler&quot; projects (e.g. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8558822"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8558822</a> and <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8576068"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8576068</a>) The &quot;precedence climbing&quot; method (<a href=""http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm</a> ), which simplifies and makes RD more efficient, is common too but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen it appear in any of the usual academic texts.",1420421626

Here&#x27;s my best guess about what we&#x27;re fucking up today, or put a little differently, what we&#x27;re doing that subsequent generations will look at with horror and disgust: eating animals.<p>I&#x27;m a carnivore, but I wouldn&#x27;t be if I had to confront the meat industry directly.  Witnessing the stuff that goes on even in the small/medium-size farms that some of my friends run turns my stomach, to say nothing of the videos of animal torture that wash up on the internet from time to time.  And as a cognitive scientist, the knowledge that animals, even &#x27;primitive&#x27; ones like rats, unequivocally have emotions makes it worse.  I live in dissonance until I can work up the guts/strength of character to go vegetarian.<p>Generally speaking, I think a lot of questions about &#x27;what are we fucking up&#x27; can be answered by rising living standards leading to an extension of empathy.  The more secure you are in your own personal circumstances, the more you have mental room leftover to give a shit about others.  In the not too recent past it was actually an okay thing to attempt to wipe out a civilization because they were inconveniencing you.  Nasty stuff still happens, but it&#x27;s generally behind the scenes.  Nobody today thinks it&#x27;s okay to butcher people just because they don&#x27;t look like you.  Even the most hardcore nutters in the States these days don&#x27;t want to wipe out Mexicans or enslave black people.  &quot;Stay out of my neighborhood and leave my family alone&quot; is about as bad as it gets in terms of position statements, which, considered in light of human history, is an astounding improvement.<p>So barring the cataclysm, I think empathy will continue to be extended, and three generations from now the idea of systematically torturing billions of chickens so we can have cheap buffalo wings will be officially appalling to the majority.",1420421583

8836688,comment,8836398,8836398,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"As an aspiring writer (read as: as someone aspiring to earn less money) I&#x27;ve looked into this quite a bit.<p>I&#x27;m married with kids (well soon to be plural anyway) so the cheap rents are out of the question, and despite their generally lower cost apartments aren&#x27;t ideal. Not only is there a high risk of bedbug infestation, which will set you back significantly if you get hit, but the costs are fixed and will increase every year.<p>From what I&#x27;ve figured out reading other peoples stories, the best way is to go nearly-off-grid. If your area allows mobile homes as a primary dwelling, then this is generally the ideal. They&#x27;re generally cheaply available, they&#x27;re normally of a size comparable to a single bed apartment, but they also come up to 3 and 4 bedroom models with two bath.<p>In rural areas these often have wood stoves as the primary heating with small propane/electric ones as backup so your pipes don&#x27;t freeze if you go away for a weekend.<p>If you&#x27;re setting up in a rural area, with 5+ acres of land you can easily be self-sustaining on your own wood supply. You can set yourself up with a small wind turbine and solar rig for your electricity.<p>Honestly though, the majority of my work experience is from various construction fields. I want to go this way to maximize my freedom. Cutting wood and tilling soil is just exercise to me so I don&#x27;t have a problem growing my own vegetables and managing my own wood lot. The only thing I&#x27;ve spent money on owning my house was getting my furnace replaced, and only then because I didn&#x27;t have the equipment to do the piping due to the age of my house.<p>My dream is to build my own house from the foundation up, and if possible using lumber I harvest myself.<p>So really you need to quantify what your reasons for doing this are. If it&#x27;s just reduce expenses for a few years to maximize your savings you&#x27;re probably best going for a college town apartment. If you want to escape the city and are merely using your skills as a means to an end to fund this endeavour, then I&#x27;d say learn the skills and go rural.<p>There&#x27;s people in Alaska and elsewhere who can make ends meet at $10 a month. You need soap? Save your stove ashes, put them in a lye barrel and you make your own lye that you can mix with fat you&#x27;ve saved from cooking or - if you&#x27;re really into it - your own hunting, or your own animals.<p>When you pay for a burger at McDonalds you&#x27;re paying for the guy who grew the corn, the guy who fed the cow, the guy who drove it to the slaughter house, for the slaughter, for the processing, for the guy who drives the delivery truck, for the kid who cooks and makes the burger, and for the kid who serves you - and for every owner, manager and foreman along the way.<p>You can pay nothing at all for a burger by growing your own corn, raising your own cows and slaughtering them, growing your own wheat, raising your own chickens and making your own bread.<p>So: Earn a shit ton of money, buy a $750,000 house and never do anything around the house. Gardener does the outside, maid does the inside and takes the garbage out on garbage day. You pick up most of your food from restaurants, or you can even hire a housekeeper that does the groceries and prepares an evening meal for you.<p>You can earn good money, buy a $250,000 house. You&#x27;ll mow your own lawn, you&#x27;ll do your own cleaning and cooking. You&#x27;ll do small repairs around the house, etc.<p>Or you can do what off-grid can do. You earn nothing, you sell what you have to. You grow your own food, hunt/raise your own meats, and you make pretty much everything you want.<p>The question is, how far down the rabbit hole does your happiness lie?",1420421441

You have system specific configuration, ranging from services to users to file systems and more, sometimes at odds with the state of a security patched/updated machine at any point in time.  The way you configured the state of a machine 12 months ago might not be reflected when you build, update, and configure a machine today.  This disconnect between installs gets compounded when you have to randomly log in and make minor tweaks to keep up with your ever-changing application specs (tweaks which rarely get documented), causing you or your successor to scratch their head wondering what steps are missing compared to before when doing a new build.  This gets even more complicated when you build large clusters meant to scale, and can&#x27;t afford to spend the time it takes to individually configure each machine.

First off, scout the areas you want to live. A lot of times real estate isn&#x27;t listed on the local RMLS site (or if it is, might be incorrect information). Second strategy get a tax plot map. Look for property owners who are out of state and send them a offer letters. Craigslist, Zillow alert and other sites have been pretty helpful for leads as well.  Third, pay attention to what other properties are selling. If everyone in the neighborhood is selling, there has to be a reason. Buy where nobody wants to sell. Finally, out of pure luck I bought my property on auction.com and was the final bidder without even looking at the property (there are ways to back out of a deal, my dad told me all the tricks :). The property information just happen to be wrong, it was the wrong zoning, address, acreage, etc. This was probably because it was in the holiday season. The Realtor assigned to the property didn&#x27;t know anything about it. Because I did a title search before placing my bid, I knew more about it then they did! And because I scouted the area well, I knew approximately what I was expecting. I also knew that buying property during the holiday season (thanksgiving to new years) is the best possible time as far as I can tell. Generally home values go up in the summer and down in the winter. I also played the 2008 recession, but values didn&#x27;t go down as much as I expected, but it helped. And no I didn&#x27;t buy a property way out in nowhere, I&#x27;m about 20 minutes away from the Redwood Forest, 45 minutes from the coast, and 30 miles away from a Home Depo/Walmart.  Regretfully, the nearest Trader Joe&#x27;s is over an hour and a half away. :)",1420420511

It&#x27;s sometimes hard to read between the lines as English is not my native language.<p>I&#x27;ll try to put some more light and perspective into how my previous work place &#x27;ticked&#x27; and how I intended to outline my passage to OpenBSD in the article.<p>My previous workplace was a large corporation. I were literally on the clock accounting for every 0.25h of work I did. You were not allowed to touch a single line of code unless you had billed hours against that task (contract with a client, bug report from a client). This literally meant that doing comprehensive code reviews or reworking a particularly nasty part of the code was not possible. There was a &#x27;process&#x27; for doing code reviews but it was so bureaucratic that going through the paper work you had to submit after one took 0.5h-2h but the time you had for a code review was counted as a percentage of the time it took someone to produce or alter the code. So if you reviewed a change that took 1h - you had 10 minutes to do the code review and all the alloted paperwork.<p>I don&#x27;t want to speak about the quality of the code base in detail due to obvious reasons but I can assure you that people working on it are really experienced and know what they are doing. Most of the problems and the humongous technical debt is years of corporate culture. Did I mention that the banking system I worked on was born around 15 years ago?<p>During my 7 years at that job. I had the chance to refactor code once. In my first 3 months of working there since I was not yet on the &#x27;clock&#x27;. When I was at my leaving period I was given a free hand and was took off the clock again. This allowed me to really look at the code, analyze potential problems and actually react on them. People that are still working on it don&#x27;t have that privilege on a daily basis.<p>The stab at Linux was actually accidental :) I use Linux personally since late 90s. What I mostly pointed out was some of my bad hardware choices in the passage and how OpenBSD drives me more into actually diving into the code contrasted to all the years I solely used Linux.<p>You are correct that my &#x27;evolution&#x27; towards tighter, smaller and correct implementations drew me towards OpenBSD. I think I had that feeling for a long time but hopefully you understand that it&#x27;s not always in the hands of the programmer himself to call the shots and do things right. What I really loved though was auditing and removing a ton of cruft in one code base while OpenBSD did the same with LibreSSL :)<p>Hope this answers your question.",1420420387

You can work for companies in the traditional rust belt industrial base, but companies like the Big3, Delphi, etc (I&#x27;m sure whirlpool and Amway are like this out in western Mich). seem to be just as happy outsourcing IT to the lowest bidder. And why wouldn&#x27;t they? It&#x27;s not their core business. GM is trying to change that but their job descriptions still mostly read like the kind that ask for 8+ years in a specific esoteric technology so they can claim they can&#x27;t find anyone and will just go with an H1-B.<p>2. You can work for companies that aren&#x27;t in any way related to the big names. Smaller software companies in the 50-500 employee range exist around the area. The thing is it can be kind of lonely working at one of these places because there&#x27;s not a huge industry of producing software to sell out here. There aren&#x27;t a whole lot of them. And the benefits are certainly not Silicon Valley, though the pay adjusted for the cost of living is still pretty good. This is the kind of place that I work in.<p>3. You can work for a company based elsewhere with a branch that&#x27;s local. These kinds of jobs can be hard to find since companies don&#x27;t usually advertise their secondary and tertiary locations. Plus working in the small branch of BIGCO(TM) may mean that you will have the choice of having to either find a new job or move when they close that branch down. There&#x27;s also the issue that you may not be able to really grow professionally at a small branch office.<p>4. You can work remote. I am starting to perhaps explore this option.I think there&#x27;s lots of promise here. But it&#x27;s still hard to search and find remote jobs. And I&#x27;m not sure that remote employees are treated equal to in office ones in a lot of employers when it comes to career progression.<p>5. There is a local startup scene here. Both in Ann Arbor and Detroit with their own incubators, and I&#x27;m sure there are ones strewn about the rest of the rust belt. I think this also holds a lot of promise. But I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re there just yet. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s been any truly huge exits for startups native to the rust belt.",1420420273

But because it&#x27;s a symbiosis, i.e. the plant trades some of the sugar it produces for the nitrate fixed by the bacteria, it&#x27;s not a cost-free situation. Legumes don&#x27;t dominate many habitats, but they do OK in very nutrient poor soils.<p>Modern crops don&#x27;t perform well outside intensively nurtured field conditions.

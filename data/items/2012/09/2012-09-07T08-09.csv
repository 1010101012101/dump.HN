It's not a virtual serial port like the Arduino nor does it connect to the ARM chip directly. The debugger is therefore the main paradigm when developing on this board, which is consistent and leads to a good user experience.<p>The debugger itself is the world's smallest and least expensive ARM hardware debugger, and it was designed so (someday) every prototyping board can have one. Galago is the first step in that direction. To keep it simple, much of the high-level debugging logic occurs in a driver that works between GDB and the device's firmware. This obviously allows you to use GDB on the command-line or through e.g. Eclipse.<p>At a high level, a browser-based IDE is used that connects down to a locally-running web server (on a high-numbered local port) that manages building, flashing and debugging your projects.  I showed a glimpse of this in the video.  All components run (or will run) on Mac, Linux and Windows.<p>For convenience and consistency, new firmware is loaded through GDB and thus through the debug interface, without having to reset the chip. This is why no button is needed.<p>We didn't want to stress these implementation details too much because not everyone who uses it can (or should) care about that, but the HN crowd can certainly appreciate the design.<p>I hope this answered your question!",1347008391

However, Wunderlist's backend was built with the intention of being a bit of a prototype, and the skills on the team are vastly different from when it was written (in PHP) compared to where we are now (using mainly Rails with a little Node.js in the backend).<p>In addition, contrary to Spolsky's claim, unmaintained code <i>does</i> rust, or ""rot"". Libraries you were using might go unmaintained in newer versions of a framework that fixes critical vulnerabilities. Code that held up well to thousands of users doesn't necessarily when you're talking about millions of users. Fighting code/app entropy is a real thing.<p>But we're taking steps to make sure this backend neither suffers from the ""second system effect"" (we got that out of the way with Wunderkit ;-)), nor simply needs to be rewritten again in a year or so. Spolsky is correct that in general, code is harder to read than write - which is why we're writing Wunderlist 2's backend to be easier to read at the cost of extra work up front. Strict conventions, enforcing documentation, challenging any code that isn't the clearest way to express the problem it's solving - well, we'll have an engineering blog post to discuss our ""Pull Request Parties"" and other related process improvements in depth at a later point in time/<p>The short version, though is that the WL2 backend is probably the most beautiful, readable codebase I've ever had the privilege of working with. Of course I'm more than a little biased, but hopefully the proof will be in the pudding when we launch it out into the world.",1347007363

3861623,comment,3861124,3861325,2,0,YmMot,,,"Right. Though Teller probably makes most of his money from performance rather than selling tricks. I know P&T do a lot of their own research and creating their own illusions, they may sometimes sell them to other pros but I doubt they engage in the large scale ""kit"" selling a lot of the less famous magicians do.<p>The problem here is telling how much of this Teller can lay claim to. He has been performing it a long time, and it's one of his signature tricks.<p>However, the heart of the trick is not terribly original. Illusions where a drawing or shadow interact with/mirror real life objects are very common and old. What teller did was take a unique version of it with a rose and package it up into a whole performance piece...and I think the issue is that this guy took that wholesale and is selling it basically as ""Teller's rose trick"" rather than using his knowledge of how the trick worked to create something similar but still unique.<p>The former is troubling, but without allowing the latter professional magic would grind to a halt.",1334815157

In fact, both countries have the ability to fight extended wars. India has been fighting a war for decades on its western frontier with Pakistan which is as rugged as the eastern frontier with China. India maintains the highest battleground presence in the world on the Siachen Glacier.\nSo no, the prospect of a land battle on the Indo-China border is neither unlikely, nor unprecedented.<p>That said, modern China is a pragmatic country whose primary focus is to keep its own population happy. China has a lot of hurdles in the path to the realization of that goal, and needs the economy of the region to stay stable for that. If China attacks India (or vice versa), global supply chains and economies will get severly affected and in turn will have an avalanche effect on the economies of both the countries.

This is why the issue of data ownership took so long to get traction.  For most people, data is invisible and using it is magic.  The only difference people noticed when they lost control of their data was that they could suddenly access it everywhere!<p>The difference between owning your data and not owning it is like the difference between living in a country with civil liberties and legal protections versus living in a country without civil liberties and effective legal protections.  The difference is abstract and meaningless until it becomes a matter of life and death, when you end up in a situation that you only thought existed in paranoid fantasies.<p>The invisible change from owning your data to being owned by Facebook and Google happened to correspond to a very noticeable improvement in convenience for users.  As in more dramatic examples from history, an authoritarian regime has delivered in a way that its predecessor could not, and as a result, people have embraced it.  It doesn't mean that people accept its ideology.  The way we think about Facebook, the way anybody thinks about Facebook who engages in these conversations about web industry economics, <i>and therefore how Facebook thinks about itself,</i> is much darker and more sinister than the aspect of Facebook that users embrace.  Users embrace the effect that Facebook has had on their lives, which is overwhelmingly positive.  The side we see is not something they embrace; it is something they have barely begun to consider.  I have faith that they will react to it as we do.<p>We are not more sensitive to freedom than they are; we are merely face to face with the problem because we like to imagine ourselves in Facebook's shoes :-)  We imagine what it's like to have that power; we are able to think in a predatory, profit-oriented mindset; we understand the temptation.  We don't have to be evil to see the temptations that Facebook faces.  And we understand that a person can withstand temptation, but a corporation cannot.  A corporation cannot withstand the temptation to make money.  Only as long as its profits exceed the wildest demands, anyway.  When profits flag, a corporation will collapse to the moral lowest common denominator, because the people who resist immoral profits will be replaced.<p>Like I said, we don't have to worry that the average Facebook user is okay with the dire scenario of Facebook fully and amorally exploiting its power.  It's completely imaginary at the moment.  Those who worry about it worry alone, but only because we are uniquely positioned to imagine it.  We can make other people understand.  Right now Facebook's major sin has been to appropriate a dangerous and therefore immoral amount of power.  They haven't abused it yet, not the way they could.  I think with the right kind of education, users will revolt and demand rights and control before Facebook breaks down and really abuses the terrifying power it has amassed.<p>Am I too optimistic?",1334812318

The abstraction is actually abstract.<p>If you're going to understand why the compiler rejected the program, you have to understand the reasoning process of the compiler.  Understanding the constraints on the result is not enough - simply because the programmer, to be sure his or her program will work, has to follow the same algorithm as the compiler, or at least some equivalent calculation, in his or her own dumb head.  This statement is not specific to Haskell, but true for all languages everywhere.<p>That for many individuals this is doable, with or without a formal understanding of PL theory, is true.

3861465,comment,3860659,3860831,2,0,dpark,,,"The split doesn't actually make a difference.  What makes a difference is the stock they issue after the split.  They want to create this new class specifically so that issuing new stock will not dilute their control (even though it will dilute everyone's ownership).<p>Basically, they found that the current dual-class structure isn't sufficient to guarantee control if they keep diluting when they issue grants to employees or pay for acquisitions with new stock.  So how do you fix that?  Well, you could buy up stock equal to the new stock you issue, but that costs cash.  Instead you could just stop issuing stock that come with voting rights, which is what they're doing.  Keep issuing stock, but just don't grant voting rights with it.  If the new stock works, that will be most or even all of what they issue going forward, guaranteeing that they will maintain majority control so long as they don't sell (too much).",1334811837

IP has been viewed as a property right for approximately 200 years.<p>It goes back to classical libertarian theories of property, and how a person has a natural right to the fruits of his labor. Well, that's in the US, where our legal philosophy was strongly influenced by Locke. In Europe, their intellectual property philosophy was more shaped by Hegel, and the idea that the creations of your mind are an extension of your personality, and so for someone to use your creations without permission would be a violation of your personalty.<p>Those who prefer to analyze from an economic viewpoint rather than a philosophical viewpoint also have long considered IP a form of property--because that's the whole point of IP economically in a free market system. For a free market to work with a good, that good needs to have certain attributes. Goods that are non-rivalrous and non-excludible, like intellectual goods, do not work with a free market. In order to try to make the free market work to determine the allocation of resources to production of intellectual goods, we use the law to artificially give intellectual goods those aspects of real property that free markets need.",1334811675

1520209,comment,1519172,1519516,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"A few other commenters have explained it pretty well, but I think the main problem is that things get lost way too easily. Most filesystems are just way too vast and even the strictest user will eventually end up misplacing a few files. And when that happens, it sucks.<p>I think the solution is not to destroy the concepts of files and folders, but to become increasingly dependent on tagging and context-sensitive searches. Most DEs have shifted to this approach; there's Spotlight in OS X, whatever that search on the start menu is called in Win7, and various daemons/systems in Linux (Beagle, Nepomuk, etc.). There are third-party utilities too, like Google Desktop Search. As those things improve, and as we see more work to narrow the filesystem concept to only things that are usable to the user and allow automatic tagging of content, usability issues will go away.",1279252485

It is horrible, <i>it is the worst language in the world ... except for all the other</i> (a la Winston Churchill and democracy). \nThe horrifical complexifications of C++ are just terrible, yet every one of them has a reason behind it. And also, the horrifical complexities are a bit more optional than the horrifical complexities of, say, Java. \nThere isn't another language that has both the large-scale modularization given by OO and low-level efficiency of direct pointer manipulation and other C features. You get a vast library of available free code and a huge number of available tools to boot.<p>There is no other language for crafting large-scale, high performance tools. Java and C# can be just as fast but even fast Java has even greater verbosity overhead. And the scripting languages are great yet their resource overhead makes up for their compactness.<p>C++ is definitely a language of ""big design"". ""<i>Thinking in C++</i>"" is a mistake. You should think in your design and implement in C++. Unlike C, C++ seduces people to take the code for the design.<p>In any case, however flawed, the thing occupies a niche no other language can.

This is one of the few C++ rants that actually brings up of legitimate points.  They are not reasons that would stop me personally from preferring C++ over C, but they are valid criticisms.<p>P.S.  On the subject of format strings vs. cout and the ""<<"" madness, C++0x's variadic templates will allow a type-safe printf.  So hopefully in the future we WILL see C++ move back toward format strings, but without loosing the type safety.  It also gives the possibility of instead of having to remember to use %d for ints and %f for floats, we could just use format strings that use {1}, {2}, etc. as format string placeholders, the way C# does.  Freeing you from having to specify in the format string what the type is is something C++0x type-safe-printf would allow you to do that you could never do in C.",1279252132

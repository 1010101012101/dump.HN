This is, FWIW, within striking distance of what you&#x27;d pay to hire a college graduate full time, but I find it easier to go through a company to avoid the headaches of that.<p>The VAs are pretty amenable to doing anything reasonable with a computer, which includes phone support.  I haven&#x27;t asked for it, both because I don&#x27;t offer phone support for Bingo Card Creator and because the US workday would mean anyone offering it from the Philippines would have to be up very late at night, which I do not feel is a reasonable thing to ask of freelancers/employees under most circumstances.",1389103105

I live in Germany, and (as pointed out in the text) carpenters can still be seen from time to time during their journeyman years (which is called &quot;Wanderschaft&quot; or &quot;Walz&quot; in German). Slightly OT but here&#x27;s a picture of what it looks like when they walk across the country [1]\nI always found this concept deeply fascinating because these people get a chance to see many things from different perspectives simply because they move out of their local village, which many people never do.<p>The application of this concept on modern trades like software development is certainly very interesting. I&#x27;m tempted to think that the biggest gain it might have is that one (as the journeyman) can get quick insights into the deep differences between workflows and company culture in the various companies one approaches. I mean, we all know how different the current employer compared to the previous employer can be, now imagine having such a switch every  1-2 weeks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.berufsausbildung-bau.de/images/Wandergesellen.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.berufsausbildung-bau.de/images/Wandergesellen.jpg</a>",1389103095

Rule #1 about dealing with the media: do their work for them.<p>The practice of getting PR pieces presented as news can be quite simplistic. One way to go: A company hires its own press agent or uses a PR firm (typically the latter for smaller companies). PR firms&#x27; specialty is in cultivating relationships with reporters, editors, and the like. It&#x27;s no big trick; mostly just human relationships and the ability to provide the newspeople with stuff they can use to get their job done. In other words, they understand the &quot;domain&quot; of news.<p>Then the original company funnels information about stuff its doing to their PR firm on a regular basis. The PR firm takes the stuff it thinks might be interesting to the outside world, helps put some spin on it, and shops it around to the contacts they think might be interested in the stories.<p>If the newspeople bite, what happens next can depend on a variety of factors. But the hard work&#x27;s been done at this point.<p>It should be noted that this isn&#x27;t the only path things can take. This story has been making the rounds for a week or so now. It&#x27;s quite possible that the WaPo was never contacted by any PR folks; instead they just saw it on other news outlets and wanted to follow up for themselves.",1389102874

Since 1973, the politics has changed, the economy has changed, and culture, religion, ideology, and (of course) technology have also undergone tremendous changes. The Internet alone should be a total game changer. Mincome serves as a good anecdote and inspiration, but it is largely meaningless to argue (for|against) basic income based on that data alone. We need more data points, and we need them to be more up to date.<p>Because right now, all we have are a precious few data points from 40 years ago and/or from the other side of the globe, and a bunch of hopeful statements that haven&#x27;t really weathered any test of evidence (e.g. economic efficiency will increase, or not; people will be happier, or not). Without solid evidence, statements like that are little more than expressions of ideological preference, both on the left and on the right. </edit><p>The experiment should be repeated, as many times as possible, in various times and places, and for longer durations (5 years, 10 years, 20 years, long enough to study a generation of children who grow up under the scheme). Accumulate enough data to support arguments (whether pro or con) that are based more on actual evidence than on anecdotes and ideological assumptions.<p>Will it be possible to implement a basic income of $20,000+ per year in the United States in 2014? Absolutely not, the political environment is not ready for it. But will it be possible to run basic income experiments on a smaller scale (Vermont, are you listening?) throughout the next two, three, four, five decades? Of course it&#x27;s possible, and at the end of it we&#x27;ll be a lot more capable of 1) making informed decisions and 2) squashing the opposition.

Build a bigger buffer than you think you&#x27;ll need.<p>I started three years ago, out of school. I&#x27;m not a hacker, and didn&#x27;t have an immediately monetizeable skill. I saw an opportunity to build recurring revenues (through e-book sales with a partner) and pursued it as fast as I could.<p>The strategy worked. Those recurring revenues are wind under my wings, and gave me the skills to expand my business into other areas.<p>But man, that was a tough couple years. I was constantly short on cash. Historically, when people guessed my age, they guessed [biological age - 3]. Once in this rough period, people guessed my biological age!<p>2013 was the year my business took off. In the final six months I earned enough to pay off my loans from school, my taxes for the year, and build a savings buffer. That was from being almost bankrupt in June.<p>What a difference. I feel relaxed. People now guess [biological age - 1 or 2], so the decrease in stress must be having an effect. I look more rejunvenated to myself in the mirror.<p>I can see and pursue opportunities much more effectively. And it&#x27;s all because I have a relatively small amount of excess dollars in a bank account. That surplus allows you to raise your head and look around.<p>Build a buffer.<p>Some time ago a HN member posted about maxims he uses to guide his life, and he ended up making a daily maxim site.

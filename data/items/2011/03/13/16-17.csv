Then, if you don't agree, you can make some more corrections, and iterate until everything's generally satisfactory.<p>Obviously false positives and negatives have far greater potential consequences here than with priority inbox, but the same general ideas can be applied. Also the social graphs of the the people on your friends list is a very rich source of data for the learning algorithms. Once you've placed two or three people from work into the 'collegues' circle the connections between those two or three examples and the other people you know from work will make it pretty simple to guess the rest of the work circle.<p>EDIT: and assuming that circle will start off by importing your google mail contacts, it already has a fair amount of implicit data about your social graph when it comes to those people due to your email activity with them, and their email activity between each other.<p>Thinking about it, the priority inbox stuff could well prove to be a very rich soruce of data for them generally in this circle endeavour.",1300035221

The design of the older plants is an historical accident. Because of the war-driven necessity of developing nuclear technology for weapons, the understanding of the technology that informed the currently-operational reactors was largely bomb-centric. But we know better today, there exists designs for reactors that are orders of magnitude safer, both in terms of operational dangers as well as its waste byproducts.<p>I'm afraid that sound-byte driven media and activists who aren't willing to evaluate newer ideas will cause such prejudice that newer, better technology will never see the light of day, and thus we'll see worse environmental problems (or economic problems) because our current energy problems can't be fixed otherwise.",1300033291

If Google, or anyone, wants to mimic real social interaction, they need to find a way to enable talking to the right people for that moment and that content.  Even the closest circles don't work in daily life.  Rarely do I think ""I'd like to go skiing with 'best friends' or 'school friends'"".  I'm much more likely to think of who skis, who hasn't just had a kid, who hasn't just lost her job, who has a job that allows vacation, etc.  Maybe I make a circle for just that, but it seems a) difficult and b) overkill.  The outreach and sharing only to that circle just isn't the hard part of the communication.

Don't think of YC as an incubator or a funding machine (or whatever you'd like to call it). They offer a lot more. I think it's more like a ticket to a community of entrepeneurs and investors, based in Silicon Valley.<p>And yes, the $150k is a nice addition, but would you pick this convertible debt over the weekly dinners, office hours, alumni help you might get and most of all connections with possible investors?

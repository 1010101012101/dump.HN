This lets them advertise to the neighbours with an example listing<p>- ""I just sold property A. Here's what your house, a 504sqm property with swimming pool and located 200 from nearby schools, might be advertised as""<p>- Personalised, generated tours of significant vineyards/scenic drives - $20-30 gets you a route planned and a custom map print out, plus all of the highlights mapped a day or two before you leave.<p>- Advertising for farmers markets. The vendors pay to have their area mapped. The benefits for them - they show you the exact location/distance their produce came from, letting you get to know the carbon cost or history of the produce - possibly rendered with QR codes so you can browse straight to the map/their website.<p>What else would you do, if you could ask for information on any area and know it would be mapped within 24 hours for a reasonable cost?",1368265415

5690199,comment,5688222,5688729,1,0,H3g3m0n,,,"As far as I'm concerned It's a good thing that there are too many DRM'd technologies.<p>They are all stamping on each other, engaging in corporate infighting, patenting the underlying DRM technology and so on. Apple want their walled garden, Google their one and nothing from one store plays on another's device. And content providers keep demanding all their resellers implement the stuff dispite anyone being able to grab anything off the PirateBay.<p>As a result the clear path is to avoid DRM and go with formats that play anywhere. Or people will just pirate everything.<p>Having one DRM standard that does play everywhere could provide a kind of unity amongst DRM. This is dangerous, we don't want that crap getting stronger. It could lead to a point where consumers are fine with DRM and are not pissed of because they can't play their iPod music on their new Android phone. People becoming accepting of DRM doesn't seem like a good outcome at all.<p>Fortunately that isn't what we are likely to get. The standard doesn't specify any actual DRM mechanism so they will keep having their walled gardens and competing technology, they will just be able to put them in a HTML5 UI instead. So in the end adding this to HTML5 seems to be totally pointless. Vendors could already implement their own extensions to HTML5 this is nothing more than a 'put drm here' hint. It's unlikely that vendors would implement anything that would allow competitors content to plan on their platform.",1368265207

5690191,comment,5690155,5690155,2,0,logical42,,,"I wonder if the word 'bitch' is now considered unacceptable in any circumstance or if the context is what makes it such an outrage. I suspect it is the latter, which leads me to wonder if there may be some sort of double standard in the kinds of vulgarity one can casually employ. I mean, I see the term 'bitch' being tossed casually in episodes of sex in the city, and conversely amongst men in a more, for the lack of a better term, 'locker room'-like context. From my limited observations of such interactions, I feel like tension arises in the use of the term from across people of different genders.<p>If the end goal or point of all this is complete and utter gender equality, then should we strive to get to a place where people can call each other a 'bitch' and have it interpreted as an offensive but not necessarily gender related remark? I apologize if my thoughts have offended anyone.. this is the logical chain of thought I've waded though in my head but I realize I could just very well be off base, considering how sensitive this subject can be. If I've caused any offense, I apologize in advance and would like to express that I am just curious what everyone else thinks about this and don't mean to justify Dave's actions or anything like that..<p>Just would like to sort of work it out in my head, and would appreciate input from the community, I guess.",1368264369

It's technologically inferior and lives in only the smallest image niche of the web, animation.<p>WebP should win over GIF. It's smaller, can be either lossy or lossless, supports full transparency, has animation, ... except for the fact that almost all GIF usage is (a) ""clipart"", (b) forums/comments/emails or (c) raw links (i.e. Imgur).<p>When I say clipart, I meant that most GIF image use would be people using GIFs made by other people. The Internet has a large treasure trove of GIFs that people will re-use from here to eternity. I doubt anyone will ever bother to convert the GIF to WebP.<p>Even if they did, if your browser doesn't natively support WebP[1] then you need a Javascript shim. Most people won't know what a shim is or won't be allowed to arbitrarily inject JS into the forum/comment/email. With raw image links, it's obviously not possibly to add a JS shim either.<p>I hate to say, but I think we're going to be stuck with GIF for a while longer...<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP#Support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP#Support</a>",1368264310

Furthermore, NT shipped with UCS-2 support, not UTF-16, as UTF-16 did not exist until 1996. UTF-16 was a migration that they completed in Windows 2000. UTF-8 was first presented in 1993 and is, therefore, older than UTF-16.<p>With all of these facts being true (I hope), today things are such that the Windows world mostly (but not completely -- they sometimes assume two-byte characters) correctly implements UTF-16, while the Linux world correctly implements UTF-8.",1368264216

Take Edward Bernays (the ""father of modern PR"" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Bernays"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Bernays</a>), whose book ""Propaganda"" said things like: ""There are invisible rulers who control the destinies of millions. It is not generally realized to what extent the words and actions of our most influential public men are dictated by shrewd persons operating behind the scenes. Nor, what is still more important, the extent to which our thoughts and habits are modified by authorities.""<p>And: ""For this reason there is an increasing tendency to concentrate the functions of propaganda in the hands of the propaganda specialist. This specialist is more and more assuming a distinct place and function in our national life.""<p>Does awareness immunize you? ""Undoubtedly the public is becoming aware of the methods which are being used to mold its opinions and habits. If the public is better informed about the processes of its own life, it will be so much the more receptive to reasonable appeals to its own interests. No matter how sophisticated, how cynical the public may become about publicity methods, it must respond to the basic appeals, because it will always need food, crave amusement, long for beauty, respond to leadership.<p>""If the public becomes more intelligent in its commercial demands, commercial firms will meet the new standards. If it becomes weary of the old methods used to persuade it to accept a given idea or commodity, its leaders will present their appeals more intelligently.""<p>A terribly amusing read, from a pre-computing programmer of people. (<a href=""http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf</a>) When guys like Ryan Holiday talk about the ""modern media"", they're stirring nostalgia for lost days of yore  which didn't exist. At least not in the timeframe they seem to imply.<p><i>[Disclaimer: I'm only halfway through the video before writing this. I'll be embarrassed if he delves into the 20th century history in the latter half. And keep in mind that ""Propaganda"" had a more neutral connotation then. Later, it got associated with the Nazis, who were actually inspired by the success of US propaganda.]</i>",1368264168

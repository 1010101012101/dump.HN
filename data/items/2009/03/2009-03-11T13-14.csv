It is specialised (or rather adapted) for HDD scans though.<p>Yes that kinda explains the proces. It's rather complex and not something I am fully versed in (it not being my field, I process the data) but I will have a shot at explaining. It is possible to analyse the individual bits and predict what the byte was before by seeing what has ""moved"" (i.e. when you zero a byte or a cluster it simply moves all the 1 bits to zero)<p>The reason 3 passes defeats is (mostly) is that it deliberately makes sure <i>every</i> bit is moved at least once (for example by writing first FF and then 00 to it). Then a final zeroing pass. Because you write the inverse of the first pass on the second run it ensures every ""pin"" is moved. Then when you write 0's anything that can be reconstructed is just the random garbage from the second pass.<p>Anyway; a 120GB disk will produce about 1TB of statistical data from the SEM process - which we can analyse. Once you get a handle on a few ""known"" files (like the OS ones) you can begin to rebuild unknown protions based on that data. Keyword recognition and file signatures help identify when we succesfully recover something.<p>You are talking about a weeks processing on 25 node cluster (100 cores).",1236779440

You still have to report your holdings in the company to the IRS as a CFC, regardless of whether the company generates a profit / pays you income / etc.  This, of course, puts a red flag on you, which leads to a higher chance of being audited, which thus would cause the IRS to go over each and every transaction from which you benefited (meaning, if the company bought a car and you used it for personal use; if the company bought a plane ticket which was for a trip for which a portion of time was spent on non-work-related leisure, etc) to see where it can be counted as income for which you are liable.<p>You can, of course, keep a foreign company, file the CFC with the IRS, and keep an accountant on hand to keep the balances separate; there are plenty of people who do this.

Some will have deen blanked with 0's (perhaps one a month). I know of only a few that specifically have had dd used on them - but usually we dont know the story of the disks :) so it could be higher.<p>We have a SEM that produces an image for our analysts to rebuild with a variety of software packages (Encase Enterprise is one example, and we have several pieces of kit from accessdata. Plus scripts/programs written in house).<p>With a zeroed disk your looking at minimum £1000 upwards and at least a months work (most of that time spent on the SEM and on one of our clusters processign the data).",1236776731

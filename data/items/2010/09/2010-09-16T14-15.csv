1697975,comment,1697489,1697489,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"I've wanted something like this for a while. It takes a lot of effort to find info about candidates that are less well known.<p>A couple of comments:<p>- I find the use of checkmarks and ""X"" to be a little too simple, since you're calculating this stuff based on an algorithm. It might be better to devise some sort of little visualization (a small pie chart, thermometer, etc...) to show me the actual score in addition to the ""X"" or 
""check"". This is useful to identify situations where a politician is deliberately waffling on an issue. For example, my own congressman has a twisted history with respect to ""Card Check"". The algorithm shows this, but I have to click into the checkmark to see his score is 75/100.<p>-It's hard not to introduce bias in the phrasing of issues (I don't have a good solution for this). For example, I'm sure some would take issue if you had labeled the abortion issue ""pro-life"" vs. the current ""pro-choice"" (conversely, I'm sure some take issue with the current use of ""pro-choice"" as a category). About the only (not great) solution I can offer for this is to show both labels and give a score (as mentioned above). Civil liberties is another. Just because the ACLU doesn't like a candidate, doesn't mean they're a knuckle-dragging, sexist, racist, homophobe.<p>-There's the potential for subtle incumbent bias by letting the candidates with the most information drive the display. If one candidate is better known, the vast majority of the categories are driven by that candidate and it has the effect of making the other candidates look like they don't have positions on those issues (when in fact, the info is probably just not as readily available). Again, I don't have a really good solution for this issue either, but detecting extreme cases and really calling it out to the user is probably the best way to mitigate this.",1284648451

I really believe we have a solid business model, and we'll be looking for seed/Series A in the next 8-12 months. Since he'll be writing the first lines of code with me, I'm pretty sure that makes him a co-founder, but he didn't come up with any of the ideas and wasn't there for the genesis of the project, so it doesn't seem like a 50-50 split is in order.

It's actually cheaper to register an LLC in Deleware than it is in my home state of VA, so I'll look at that.<p>I am aware that I will have to keep all the paperwork, hold an annual meeting (even if it is with myself) and everything else to make sure it's established as an entity.<p>Besides personal liability, finances are another issue. The main thing I want to do though is when I sign up for services like ad.ly, bing advertising and even Google adsense, all the money goes into an account other than my personal one. That way I can also track how much money I'm really bringing in. Using it for personal consulting would be very helpful as well. This also means I can transfer my domains to that entity as well. The separation of finances is something that I think will be very helpful. I'm currently on a 3 year plan I created to get rid of a lot of my own debt, so separating business finances will be helpful. Also, at this stage I'd like to make sure everything the projects make go back into project so that hopefully one of them does turn out to be a profitable venture.",1284648101

This is why single-person LLCs can file a Schedule C as a simple attachment to their own taxes, which gets reported on personal taxes as other income, just like the K1 would.

a) As soon your dive buddy saw your air gauge was that low he should have gone into the share air procedure.  Parent's idea of letting him have your main reg while fumbling for the spare is also a good idea (although I don't believe most training includes that step).
b) The divemaster should have been proactive about asking you how much air you had.  It is really easy to suck down a lot of air quickly (especially your first few dives) and asking the group how much air they are using early on can indicate if someone is being aggressive with their air.
c) i can't believe you guys were spread 60-70 (in total) away from each other.  That's pretty far.
d) If you were that low under where you ran out after 10 feet, the DM should have taken you up.  Remember you also need to inflate your BCD on the surface, you don't know if the boat is going to be there, lots of things can still go wrong.<p>I've been in a really similar situation.  100 feet down, my dive buddy was someone who hadn't dove in 5 years. It was a drift dive and he was trying to take a lot of pictures.  20 minutes into the dive (the DM queried, he didn't volunteer) he revealed he had roughly 500 PSI left (some believe that's the level you should be at when you get <i>out</i> of the water).

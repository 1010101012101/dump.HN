It's a common practice especially on UNIX and MacOS to generate configuration silently, when needed instead of focusing user's attention on that during installation.<p>Other than that, installation is essentially copying. The proper place, file-type bindings, version checks etc can be done by the system automatically, again, without annoying the user (and the developer, too). And that's exactly what MacOS was doing since version 5 in 1980's.<p>(Besides, Windows Registry is one of the main sources of complication).",1181696030

I don't want native applications on the iPhone, but cheap data rates would be a killer feature!<p>I have a Windows Mobile based Smartphone and have only 2 applications installed. A Sudoku game and a homescreen application.

Apple's tech is clearly superior in that respect. Just look at the iPhone... it has a ""huge"" (by today's LCD standards anyway) pixel density and Apple's font rendering looks really amazing.",1181694533

I think YC readers are more interested in the ""create something cool/valuable/fun and love what you do"" method.<p>Personally, I would rather be building things and creating value, rather than playing cat-and-mouse with search engines and ad networks.<p>Maybe I am misinterpreting him though.",1181694280

27649,comment,27228,27455,0,0,mojuba,,,"Have you ever worked on Mac? Basically there is no such a thing like ""installation"" on MacOS. PC users usually don't believe it until they see it themselves.<p>Simplicity requires some effort and thinking, and on the contrary, it is relatively easier to design bloated software.<p>And I'm sure, when some Microsoft installer pretends it's ""analyzing system configuration"" and freezes for a dozen of seconds with no disk or CPU activity - I'm sure it's just a trivial call to Sleep().",1181693260

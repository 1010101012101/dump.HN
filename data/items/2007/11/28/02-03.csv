Is there anywhere else where a regular guy can get this kind of leverage?<p>(As to the term 'gambling', I think people are using the broad definition by which day-trading and other such financial transactions are termed a 'gamble' rather than a 'very risky, poorly informed financial investment on such a short time-scale that one can't possibly make informed predictions of price movement'. Similarly, I believe that poker is often legal because it's a 'game of skill', but that doesn't mean it's not also a gamble.)",1196218162

Sounds like they just take forex quotes and instead of displaying them in a graph or with tickers, they use competitive games and you get to watch your currency duke it out with the other currencies.<p>The fishy part is them leaving off bid/ask spreads off the site. Couldn't find them while taking a quick glance.<p>They also use 400:1 leverage meaning for $25 you can trade $10000. You're wiped out in a 0.25% price move. Looking at the yen today <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=USDJPY=X&t=1d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=USDJPY=X&t=1d</a> long or short anyone would be wiped out with that kind of margin.<p>",1196216821

If companies stop trying to establish a presence in Russia because of actions like this then maybe some change will come about. The biggest problem at the moment is that Russia supplies vast amounts of crucial energy to Europe. With that kind of leverage it's hard to see how political leaders in the EU will have the backbone to encourage Russia to stop acting like a corrupt dictatorship.",1262001157
1018475,comment,1017912,1017973,0,0,yardie,,,"I compare this to when I was a student. Because it was hard to go from top 10% to top 1% I didn't get any special award. But some students got awards for 'improvement'. A lot of my colleagues thought the same thing. ""WTF, this dumbass goes from failure to average and gets a plaque, while I've been busting my ass all year for an attaboy?""<p>I'm sure it seems stupid, but when you've been groomed for 12 years to attain achievements any achievement is seen as a positive.<p>It's probably not correct, but it's how I see NCLB. Being rewarded for being a failure 9/10 of the time.",1262000640

Surely it's obvious that drugs, disinfectants and anti-bacterials will, over time, cause to arise bacteria that are resistant to them?  Well, apparently not.<p>I've had this debate many times over.

Premature optimization may be the root of all evil, but having a long conversation with the back end database is FAIL.<p>Most Entrepreneurs are way to young to have the depth of experience to really understand what they are doing.  But, they are judged on a separate scale.  Twitter design is probably evolving to a reasonable design, and Facebook might be fairly elegant at this point, yet they both started as crap. These entrepreneurs had deadlines but they where not trying to send someone to the moon with the computing power of a watch.  Business is about the last hack standing and not creating art, but evolution also works.",1262000266

Not only does it make it easier for people to access it (as you saw, it's difficult to get it from me personally), but it's been interesting to walk over it myself.  It's been some years since I've so much as looked at it, so it's been interesting to look over things like NuContext, the COM class infrastructure, etc.  I've forgotten most of the deep details of the codebase, so it's been like reading it for the first time.  Really very cool.<p>I'm going to try and grab the Philosopher (compiler infrastructure used for the shader hacking) source off my backup drive in a few days and throw it up on Github.",1261999803

In fact, I don't see any way it <i>couldn't</i> be decades long, if the plan is real windows compatibility.  However, I think that the points I detailed under the potential new Alky design would keep things considerably simpler (though I think it's unlikely anyone would pick up the design).<p>As I said, I think the absolute key is a focus on maintainability.  Everything comes from there.",1261999454

Viewed discretely, their lives and personalities seemed idiosyncratic and 'interesting'.<p>Blogs and Twitter and open resources such as arXiv give the world a continuous look at scientists (and their work), which, as is more often than not, seems mundane and incremental, instead of path-breaking and revolutionary.<p>Also, the levels of noise on the Internet makes it singularly hard to be 'interesting' in your own unique way.",1261999181

I think the general public is no longer well equipped to appreciate their work so they tend to be clogs in the machine just doing their job like everyone else.

How disappointing, it was shaping up into an interesting argument.<p>Anyways to answer your question about why less effective arts are popular, I think you already gave the important part of the answer.  To be effective, the style must involving training at speed with real and continued contact.  (Having protective padding is OK, but you need the contact.) If it doesn't involve that, then when you actually get hit in a real fight you are going to be in trouble really fast.<p>But your random Joe who wants to get in shape and be able to protect himself in the unlikely event of a real fight doesn't <i>want</i> to spar at speed with real and continued contact.  And so will gravitate to the most impressive looking martial art that doesn't scare him.",1261998827

As long as i believe the quality of people in here remains as it is in the first day then i am ok.<p>What bothers me not the points,karma,content or improper comments; Its the number of fresh news that increased a lot.I started to use RSS reader and what i observe that there are so much news in HN(79) then Slashdot(13) even delicious(48)?! The more i spend time in HN the more i miss good links because given more choice to the people, they tend to put aside the quality and take all.<p>A bit thinking about the number of fresh news i think several problems lately addressed here(other topics) closely linked to this. More news leads to more comments and more comments creates more fuss(noise) Quality of a discussion greatly reduce as more participants, lengthy comments(self reference here) and deep reply branches.Like your favorite TV discussion program where after couple of hours everyone has a word and shouting each.The quality of comments may be,may be, increase if (high karma)&(register date) take precedence. Think about the anchorman of your favorite tv discussion program: does he start with people in the backseats or starts with some wise figure?",1261998760

1018452,comment,1017445,1017445,0,0,cstross,,,"<i>Readers want books that are plentiful and cheap, publishers want to preserve their profit, and authors want a larger share of revenue.</i><p>What this article misses out <i>entirely</i> is the distribution chain.<p>Publishers aren't distributors. Amazon is a distributor and a retailer rolled into one. Ingram is a distributor. The other wholesalers are distributors.<p>The distributors take 70% of the gross revenue from a book, leaving 30% to split between authors and publishers. The reason the publishers are defending their margins is that Amazon are trying to increase the already-silly 70% cut that they're taking (by combining the retail and wholesale distribution stages into one entity). Amazon are also trying to bootstrap ebooks by cutting prices, and they don't want to run the whole process out of their own pocket. So the squeeze is on.<p>The <i>smart</i> publishers would be setting up ebook storefronts and selling direct to the public -- establishing their own distribution arm, in other words. But they're not used to thinking in those terms (if anything, they've been moving in the opposite direction for decades, shedding direct sales forces and outsourcing printing and low-level production work like typesetting).",1261998447

1018450,comment,1017979,1017979,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"I'd say another big game changer is going to be APIs becoming ubiquitous. A lot of sites are already doing this, but in the next few years, expect even more open APIs from even more sites. Screen scraping should become largely a thing of the past. I expect the Internet to take on a Unix philosophy with web apps becoming very well suited at individual tasks instead of kitchen-sink type applications. Information will be passed in XML (plain text or gzipped), apps will be strung together fairly easily if we keep pushing for RESTful APIs, and the winners will be the people that build on other sites in useful and ingenious ways.<p>You can already see this with Twitter. A social networking site that is basically just the status field from Facebook being utilized for all sorts of other tasks because they have an open API. Expect to see more sites take individual features from other sites (or create completely new features) and build really great services with just <i>that</i> feature.<p>For this to happen, a ubiquitous login is going to have to really take hold, but I already see that happening with Facebook Connect. It's proprietary, but they've already reached critical mass and it doesn't break the username/password paradigm that people are used to. OpenID, while great in concept, is going to lose because people aren't used to having a URL represent them.",1261998138

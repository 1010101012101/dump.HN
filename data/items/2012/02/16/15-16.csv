I think Scala will continue to be a pretty interesting language, used in pretty cool places, for a smart and enthusiastic community, as Haskell or Clojure, but it will not replace Java as the major JVM language not even in a million years. Smart engineers will develop in Scala, Assembly, Lisp, whatever, but it's the average developer who accounts for the use of a language worldwide. And Scala will loose those developers from the start.<p>I also agree that Java will be dead by 2014, but not as COBOL. It will be dead as C language is dead.

Is it to wrestle further control of the app eco-system on OSX? Or is it just security theatre? Or both? Something else?</i><p>I don't understand the question. Apple has been improving OS X security mechanisms in every OS X update. From ""address space layout randomization"" to the ""first run warning"". This is another step in the same direction.<p>Are you implying that Apple should only do something about OS X security AFTER malware on OS X get's to be a problem? Because, I'd rather they do it BEFORE.<p>And I fail to see how pro-actively making an OS more secure is ""security theater"".<p><i>Then it will be a lot easier for them to require apps to be signed. For your own protection of course.</i><p>Of course. I miss the irony here. Signed applications are touted by security experts as a highly successful security measure. Are you suggesting it is otherwise or are you just confusing the potential of misuse of that feature with that feature being meaningless?<p>* After all, if developer IDs are so easy and free to get, and will make it easier for people to install your app. Why wouldn't you get it signed?*<p>Yeah, why? Surely not for the $100 it takes.<p>SSL certificates cost money too, but I don't see anybody suggesting running your web app in plain HTTP is better, or that paid certificates hamper secure web application development.",1329407199

3599108,comment,3598507,3598686,6,0,smacktoward,,,"> Only if one accepts the slippery slope fallacy that they'll eventually remove the ""No unsigned code"" option.<p>Not at all, for several reasons.  First, defaults are powerful things. The vast majority of users never change them, or even become aware that they <i>can</i> be changed. This remains true even if you throw an unskippable dialog box right up in their face -- lots of people will just blindly click ""OK"" to accept whatever the default in the dialog box is, without stopping to consider the alternatives. The result is that default settings tend to become ""the new normal,"" even when they're sub-optimal.<p>(Example: why did IE6 rule the Web for a decade, despite being demonstrably inferior to the alternatives for most of that time? Because for nearly all users, <i>it was the default.</i>)<p>This seems especially true in the case of this particular preference, for two reasons. First, it's a technical question (""what's 'unsigned code?'""), which means many users will avoid changing it for fear that they don't fully understand the consequences of doing so. Second, it involves security, and users have been trained that in questions of security departing from ""standard operating procedure"" puts them at risk, so others will avoid changing it for fear that doing so will expose them to new vulnerabilities.<p>In other words, it's not unreasonable to expect that offering unsigned code will quickly become an infeasible strategy for OS X developers, even if users still have the option to accept such code.  The option may be there, but those developers will find themselves marginalized simply for being something other than the default.",1329406865

If OS X grows in marketshare, it will become an increasingly attractive target for malware developers. If the default is that the majority of Apple users only run signed applications (this also means that the certificate wasn't revoked), then the number of possible ""users"" for your malware is greatly reduced, making OS X a much less attractive target platform for malware developers.<p>> After all, if developer IDs are so easy and free to get, and will make it easier for people to install your app. Why wouldn't you get it signed?<p>If you are a legitimate developer, then there's no reason not to (assuming it actually is free and easy, which isn't clear).

3599059,comment,3598165,3598434,3,0,scarmig,,,"Not to derail the thread, but I think the entire ""first world problem"" meme, though useful in that it reminds us of our relative privilege, isn't totally fair to either the people experiencing the problem or to the people solving it.<p>First world problems are still problems. And the existence of people experiencing much worse problems doesn't mean those first world problems are not worth solving. Indeed, virtually any problem could be considered not worth solving if you can identify anyone anywhere in the world in a worse off situation. Typing in a couple words and having a machine return documents automatically based on the input isn't a solution to a real problem, because people exist in East Palo Alto who are functionally illiterate. Finding a cure for Alzheimer's isn't a solution to a real problem, because a supermajority of people in Zimbabwe die decades before they might even get it. It's all a matter of degree.<p>And if you buy into market economics, it's not even clear that focusing on first world problems is a detriment to solving other problems. If the parent spends 10 minutes buying a plane ticket instead of 2 hours because of the implementation of an ""everywhere"" option, that creates a consumer surplus that could very well be worth a couple hundred dollars. Flyers can be routed to places on planes that are underutilized, reducing GHG emissions by a meaningful amount (which is incredibly valuable for residents of developing nations). Hundreds of thousands (millions? I don't know the market size) of person-hours could be saved. Some of that value inevitably would trickle down to people with graver problems.",1329406265

He starts by blowing you away with demos of software he's built, but then he backs up and reviews how he got there and why. His self-discovery process involved trying, making, and experiencing lots of things over a difficult period of ten years. That process eventually gave him the perspective to find commonality in things that make him react strongly. From there he found a principle to live by. For Bret and other examples he cites, it's not about domains and returns. It's about having a distinctive principle or cause that guides your decisions and approach to domains.<p>See also: mbarnett's response.

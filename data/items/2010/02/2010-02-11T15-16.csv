With that being said, it's a lot of responsibility for a parent to take on themselves.<p>I was home schooled, as were most of my siblings, and I think that it really depends on the parents.  Some parents actually teach their kids, spend the time with them, offer some sort of direction, and I think it can really give those kids a great start to life and a positive outlook towards learning.<p>My parents, on the other hand, didn't really put the effort necessary into teaching us, and as a result I didn't learn to read until I was almost 12, and than only because my mother finally put me into public school.  Reading, writing, basic math, history, geography, you name it, I was missing it from my education. My poor 5th and 6th grade teachers had a heck of a time trying to catch me up to the other students.  That doesn't do a whole lot for a kid's confidence, when he can see that he is obviously and severely behind academically compared to his peers.  I just thought I was stupid. My mom thought I had dyslexia or something.  Turns out I just needed someone to sit down with me and actually teach me.<p>There's also a lot of social development that takes place at school, and most of the time you can tell when a kid is home schooled by the way they interact with people.  Or maybe it's just me, coming from that background, I can usually tell when I'm talking to a home schooler, they often have a certain social awkwardness about them. I know I was the same way until I met my wife and she straightened me out.  I often had a hard time appropriately regulating the volume of my voice (""do you realize how loudly you're talking?), or knowing when certain things were inappropriate to say under specific social circumstances.  And I totally fail at Trivial Pursuit (we didn't watch a lot of TV growing up either.)<p>Having said all that, I finished my college degree early, graduated with honors, and am a successful software engineer and wannabe entrepreneur.  I have a strong hunger to learn, a well developed sense of curiosity, and I have a knack for teaching myself new skills.  I don't know if I am who I am because I was home schooled (although you could probably make a pretty good case for it due to my unstructured upbringing), and given my success in life I don't mean to sound unappreciative.  It just would have been nice to be able to read a little earlier in life, that's all.  And I'm still not very good at math.",1265903843

1117849,comment,1117145,1117219,0,0,logicalmind,,,"You're right on about taste vs texture. Often times the tenderness/texture is inversely proportional to the flavor in steaks. Which is why you see many menus placing something like blue cheese on top of beef tenderloin.<p>However, the ""freshness"" of beef is in interesting topic. When a cow is slaughtered it is bled and hung in a cooler for about a week. At this point it is usually cut up into primal cuts or sub-primal cuts, sealed in cryovac and sent to the store. At wholesale clubs you can usually buy these whole sub-primals in cryovac. In a normal store the ""butcher's"" simply cut up the sub-primals into normal size and sell them. The people who work the meat counter in the typical store are simply meat cutters and no longer butchers in the true sense.<p>Some restaurants keep their meat in the cryovac for extended periods of time and they call this ""aging"" which is technically called ""wet aging"". And vastly inferior to dry aging. Dry aging is simply leaving a sub-primal in a temperature appropriate room for an extended period to allow bacteria to break down the meat and moisture to evaporate, thus increasing flavor.<p>Freshness in terms of beef really means ""never frozen"". If you freeze beef (or any protein really) then ice crystals form and cause damage to the cellular structure of the meat. This means that juices from the meat will simply exit the meat and never return, no matter how long your rest the meat after cooking.",1265903523

Go down to the ""citations"" part. Any decent article that might actually be the topic of an assignment will have five to ten times more ""real"" citations from primary sources than any teacher ever assigned me to have in school.<p>Wikipedia is still a ""cheat code"" for school assignments, you just have to use it right. Copying and pasting Wikipedia text is wrong. Following it to primary sources is hard to call ""wrong"", harder to detect, and, honestly, at the point where you're yelling at the student for getting your primary sources from one place and not another you're crossing dangerously close to ""You did the assignment too efficiently, do more busy work"" rather than ""I want you to learn something from real sources"". Students are very sensitive to that sort of message (even if only subconsciously) and we send the ""do more busywork"" message pretty loudly as it is; we don't need to amplify it any further. (I'd say, if the assignment has become too easy, make the assignment harder by making it <i>actually</i> harder, rather than forcing inefficient techniques.)<p>(BTW, my ""write a paper that could be copied from Wikipedia"" period ended well before Wikipedia existed, but unless they've radically changed the types of papers that are assigned, this is still essentially the optimal approach in terms of time.)",1265903522

1117792,comment,1117489,1117489,0,0,Shooter,,,"[I've written about this on HN a couple times before, but it was a long time ago and I can't find it in my history.]<p>I designed a software program to detect skin cancer a few years ago.  At the time, there were probably already a dozen such skin cancer pattern recognition programs/systems for sale. Almost all of them are/were significantly more accurate at detecting melanomas than dermatologists.  I was mainly just trying to improve the accuracy of the existing software a tiny bit and to improve my programming skills. I didn't work on the hardware side of the equation at all.  I didn't expect to make any money or to achieve much...I'm not too sharp as far as algorithms go and I usually coast by on marketing and domain knowledge.  But, miraculously, I did eventually achieve my accuracy/consistency goals.  I was unbelievably excited.  I formed a small company to handle the IP for all my medical software experiments - including the skin cancer software - and I set about marketing the software to medical companies with dollar signs in my eyes.  And it was one of the few times I DIDN'T run into crazy patent issues.  I eventually sold the company to one of the largest engineering conglomerates in the world (to their medical division, specifically) so that I wouldn't have to deal with the regulatory crap.  Being greedy, I worked out a royalty scheme on the skin cancer software in exchange for a smaller company sale price.<p>SERENDIPITOUS SIDE STORY:  I was working on the software one day while my wife was getting ready to go to an amusement park, and I noticed she had a mole that reminded me of one of my cancer training slides.  I asked her to get it biopsied.  She put it off for a week or two, but I kept nagging her that I didn't like the looks of it.  She went to her GP, and they told her it was fine and not to worry about it.  I was pissed off, and asked her to go to a dermatologist to have it looked at.  She went to a dermatologist...and was again told that it was fine and not to worry about it.  I demanded she have it biopsied...to ease my mind.  My wife works at the same hospital with these physicians, and she didn't want to rock the boat...but I'm very annoying when I get stuck on something.  So, my wife finally had it biopsied.  It comes back as a particularly nasty melanoma.  She ends up having several large excisions and her lymph nodes biopsied.  They eventually completely removed her axillary lymph nodes on one side (which caused some other problems), but she was extremely lucky overall.  She had PET scans and other monitoring for a bit. Then they said she is completely cancer-free.  They do exams every other month for her now, because she is pregnant  - and pregnancy increases melanin production.  Melanoma also has a large genetic component, which I didn't really know about until all of this happened.  Her uncle died of the same type of melanoma yesterday.  And they had told him HE was completely cancer-free about 10 months ago.  This shit can keep you up at night.<p>My plans to move to a tropical paradise have been derailed, unfortunately, but my wife is still cancer-free.<p>So...in the few years since the sale I've made exactly $0 in skin cancer software royalties.  It turns out the huge conglomerate bought my company for the insurance/billing stuff we had designed, not the skin cancer software. They have been largely unsuccessful in selling complete skin cancer detection systems that they already own, and don't intend to do much in that area for the foreseeable future. Most dermatologists simply don't want the software/devices, for starters.",1265902426

If, however, parents wanted to withdraw their students from school so they could 'teach' them that evolution isn't real, or to keep them from having to go to a school that was too racially diverse (say, in the South right after Brown vs. Board of Education), I would say that the parents are doing their own children harm and their children should have to go to school.

You can buy roasted peanuts or get some noodles or meat or vegetables stir-fried from a cart on the street.<p>We don't have this in the United States because of regulation - one particular regulation in California says you need to have a sink to wash your hands in order to sell food. Thus, no street vendors unless they have a portable sink (really, I asked a farmer's market person on this - you need a portable sink in a van to run a street market).<p>Now, on the surface, this is an imminently sensible regulation. Who wants to have food by someone who didn't wash their hands? But that's just the thing - <i>I do!</i> The food is good, the vendor would be happy to sell it, I'm happy to buy it, and I darn well know the guy with the cart doesn't have the highest health standards and I make my own choices. Some street food is not up to my standards, some is.<p>Regulation prohibits me from making that adult decision for myself, so I'm forced into higher priced food of similar quality, or going to Taco Bell instead of getting some stir fried chicken, vegetables, and noodles.<p>I imagine at least one-third of regulations make sense on some level and do at least as much good as harm, but it's a little like censorship to me. It's a door you don't want to open if possible, despite the fact that there is rather nasty stuff you'd rather suppress. You'd rather suppress the bad stuff, it's probably objectively good to suppress the bad stuff, but you're always going to wind up with well-intentioned-yet-misguided people going too far. Hence, we're unable to buy street food due to the seemingly sensible regulation that no one can buy food from someone unless that person has a sink.",1265901459

A thought on presentation - I've got a longer attention span and more endurance than the average blog reader, I am rather completely fascinated by this topic and it's directly relevant to me, and yet I had a hard time getting through that entire post in one sitting.<p>It required an awful lot of thinking on one unified theme (how law shapes the business landscape), but all the examples were stand alone and thought provoking in and of themselves. I wonder if a three part series might not get more readers reading all the points, more exposure, and more knowledge spread. But that's a presentation point only, cheers for the very fascinating, incredibly well researched and presented piece. The regulation tying profits to return on capital and inability to store surplus power strikes me as particularly crazy.",1265901219

1117727,comment,1117145,1117253,0,0,illumin8,,,"A great way to cook a steak if you have good ventilation is to use a cast iron skillet and heat the skillet in an oven to 500 degrees.  Brush the steak with olive oil ahead of time, and make sure it is room temperature (not fridge temperature).  Pull the skillet out of the oven, put it on the stove.  Turn the burner up on the stove, and cook the steak for 30 seconds on each side, then put the entire skillet back in the oven for 2 minutes on each side.<p>The steak will be tender and juicy, since searing it at such a hot temperature locks in most of the juices, similar to the way a wound is cauterized.<p>I only recommend you do this if you have a VERY well ventilated kitchen, as the amount of smoke generated will surely set off any smoke alarms in your house otherwise.<p>Sidenote:  Why is it that a lot of modern kitchens don't have properly ventilated hoods that actually vent outside?  It seems ridiculous that most of the hoods over stoves nowadays just recirculate the air back inside.  When I want to cook, I want to cook, damn it!",1265900583

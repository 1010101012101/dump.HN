For example, many math topics read as if they are the intro section of some Mathematics graduate student&#x27;s thesis, whereas most biology topics read like some high school biology student&#x27;s book report. Compare the article for &quot;Markov Process&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process</a>), which starts with a nice introduction but quickly devolves into foreign symbology, to the article for Caspase 9 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase_9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase_9</a>), one of the most important components in the process of apoptosis, itself one of the most importent processes in growth, development, disease, cancer, etc...which has barely 4 sentences and a dozen references.",1401029843

If a poorly written, undocumented piece of code stuck in a file called temp123_final_final_no_really_final.m produces the same output as a higher quality piece of code, no one cares as long as it leads to a publication.<p>2) You don&#x27;t need a degree in neuroscience to do neuroscience research, however you&#x27;ll probably need to take a few basic neuroscience courses to get up to speed depending on what area you&#x27;re interested in focusing on. It sounds like you&#x27;re interested in theoretical neuroscience. For that you&#x27;ll need to take lots of probability and statistics.<p>3) Make no mistake, your ability to write clean, well documented code will be massively under-appreciated by nearly everyone.<p>4) As far as division of labor goes, that usually depends on the lab size. The smaller the lab, the more you do. Even in some large labs you have people building software AND doing animal surgeries AND running experiments. There usually isn&#x27;t a person dedicated to a specific type of labor.<p>5) To &quot;fiddle&quot; with the brain, you&#x27;d have to get into animal research as you can&#x27;t really do that with people (yet?)<p>A lab worth checking out is the lab of Gyorgy Buszaki: <a href=""http://www.buzsakilab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buzsakilab.com/</a>",1401029705

7796453,comment,7795035,7795176,1,0,j2kun,,,"I largely agree with you, but there are recent pushes to make the study of genetic algorithms (usually not stated this way) more palatable to the theory community. Look, for example, to the work of Christos Papadimitriou [1] (who is <i>the</i> anti snake-oil guy if I&#x27;ve ever seen one). He gave a talk last year at the Simons Institute on his ideas [2]. See also [3].<p>The essential argument of this new school is that GAs (and evolution in general) do not try to find the optimal individual. Here is a reader&#x27;s digest argument as to why: say you had actually achieved the perfect individual, then sex would result in imperfect children while the parents die off. So if evolution isn&#x27;t optimizing fitness, what is it optimizing? One hypothesis is that it&#x27;s balancing fitness and <i>variation,</i> so that if the environment changes drastically the entire population does not die off.<p>[Edit: another note to add] And there is a common adage in CS theory that for every problem, a focused gradient descent algorithm (using knowledge about the optimization function, domain, etc.) will always outperform GA. So this is a sort of meta-theorem that says <i>asexual</i> reproduction is better at finding the optimal individual than sexual reproduction.<p>There are concrete techniques being analyzed in this context, for example the &quot;Multiplicative Weights Update Algorithm,&quot; which has been proven to perform well against adversarial manipulations of the environment. See [4] for a long and detailed reference of its applications to classical CS problems.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/p/Papadimitriou:Christos_H="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/p/Papadimitr...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWv-s6KuDlM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWv-s6KuDlM</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/evolution2014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/evolution2014</a>\n[4]: <a href=""https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/pubs/MWsurvey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/pubs/MWsurvey.pdf</a>",1401029172

For example, the reason screen glass often isn&#x27;t replaceable is because it&#x27;s optically bonded to the underlying LCD, which improves sharpness, reduces glare, and reduces parallax when using a pen. The reason batteries usually can&#x27;t be replaced is that it saves space and weight to use naked Li-Poly battery packs molded to the available space. Making say a back case removal reduces structural rigidity and reduces space available for a battery. That&#x27;s engineering--making trade-offs between features people may not care about in favor of features they care more about.",1401028425

I don&#x27;t know if his training was as intense as a SEAL&#x27;s but he saw active duty and looked long and hard at his actions and those of this country and applied to become a conscientious objector.<p>I think he valued and lived all the things the UT guy talked about, but to me it seemed he did one thing further. After all, when a country goes to war, the other side has soldiers who share all those values too. What makes one side better than the other? I doubt many would say might should make right. I don&#x27;t know if anyone can answer that question better than any other, but I believe he concluded that you have to examine your conscience and the conscience of the military for which you work and the civilians for whom it works. He told me that when he enlisted his intent was to defend his country but that his experience and thoughtful consideration showed him the U.S. military today wasn&#x27;t about defense. What it was about he couldn&#x27;t say for sure, but it had more to do with corporate control than defense. He felt lied to by a system that was designed to lie to him and everyone else and he couldn&#x27;t see changing in his lifetime. That his participation in the military would force him to support with his actions things he could not support. This is an Ivy League guy who was decorated and nearly made the NFL and Olympics.<p>The UT guy talked about very important things. I agree we would all benefit from them. All his underlined parts were about changing the world. He didn&#x27;t say only the military provided those things, but I think it&#x27;s worth calling out that you can get them elsewhere, as well as other things you can&#x27;t get from the military. I&#x27;m sure he knows plenty more than I do, but I think my friend had one extra step that I didn&#x27;t see in that speech about changing the world, something about thinking deeply and considering a bigger picture about the consequences of your actions.<p>I&#x27;m sure he thought these things through himself, and I&#x27;m sure many soldiers do. Maybe all of them do. If they concluded they were doing right, they have the right to their conclusions. I&#x27;m not trying to say he was wrong or that the military is wrong. Everyone has their values. I just didn&#x27;t see the call to examine your values in the speech. I suspect more people would become conscientious objectors if that message was stronger.

Articles explicitly tagged with a warning at the top (needs references, might be biased, reads like an advertisement, doesn&#x27;t represent a worldwide view of the subject, is out of date, etc.).

These are supposed to be at least passable, free of the obvious problems in the previous category. Though sometimes they just haven&#x27;t been properly marked. The reader should treat them with appropriate caution, looking for references for claims (especially any surprising claims), corroborating with other sources, and assuming that the article may be incomplete.<p>3. Articles marked as &quot;good articles&quot; [1]. These have been reviewed by one or more editors, and are considered to be well-referenced and reasonably complete. They&#x27;re marked by a little green plus in the upper-right. A conservative use of Wikipedia could be to treat anything at a lower level than this one as a draft article, in various stages of draftiness.<p>4. Articles marked as &quot;featured articles&quot; [2].

HN has a community of interesting commentators, but it still relies on journalists to provide the basis for that community.",1401026468

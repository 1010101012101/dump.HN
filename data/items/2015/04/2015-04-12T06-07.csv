9362409,comment,9360498,9361707,0,0,zaroth,,,"I think the problem is that what we have now is much worse. Today we pay people to not work, as in quite literally by earning less you can take home more. Plus, if you don&#x27;t work, then you can do all sorts of other productive (cost reducing) things with your time, and you also don&#x27;t carry all the associated non-deductible costs of working.<p>The slope of progressive taxes and regressive subsidies is bewilderingly high. Particularly if you have higher health care expenses or anything which might be considered a disability, the first $90k of gross earnings for a family of 4 is almost entirely going to the State & Fed.*<p>As more people &quot;catch on&quot; to the math we see more people dropping out of the labor pool. The story in the media is it&#x27;s because people have given up on finding work. But I think a significant portion of it is because it&#x27;s simply not worth working. Not everyone has figured out yet how much the Fed will pay you to not work, but when you do the math I think every middle-class worker should be very angry about it.<p>Now I&#x27;m not sure we want to have a system where everyone is paid exactly the same amount no matter what, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that a system which pays less as you pay more taxes is broken.<p>* If you take the total market value of all subsidies available to a family of 4 earning nothing, and add in the all-inclusive taxes paid as a result of a family of 4 earning $90k (at about which point subsidies have gone to zero), together those numbers will add to about $90k.<p>If we get more technical, the numbers are actually shifted up by about $30k, because of the standard exemption and child tax credits, the first $30k of income doesn&#x27;t count. So really it&#x27;s $30k - $120k where you&#x27;re effectively working for the Fed.",1428821224

In fact, you can&#x27;t even have an &quot;a&quot; in the same word with a &quot;y&quot; due to the vowel harmony rules.<p>The thing that makes Finnish alphabet very easy, is that every character corresponds to one sound (with the exception of &quot;c&quot;, which can be either &quot;k&quot; or &quot;s&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t actually used in Finnish (it just exists for legacy and compatibility with Swedish)) and vice versa (with the exceptions of &quot;w=v&quot; and &quot;å=o&quot;, but, again, they&#x27;re not used in Finnish)<p>That is, a character will always sound the same, regardless of what is around it.

9362391,comment,9360093,9360093,0,0,topkai22,,,"I&#x27;ll give the consultant answer- it depends. There are still a surprising number of employers who don&#x27;t do a internet search on prospective employees, but assuming you apply to one that does, testimony would only have a negative effect if they a) found the testimony and b) thought you to be risk because of it.<p>As others have said a) is  pretty easy to avoid if you aren&#x27;t the star witness in a major trial and you have any sort of web presence (or you have the same name as someone famous.) Assuming a potential employer did hear about the trial, they are going to care a lot more if your testimony is related to something they MIGHT be doing\accused of doing. If you are being asked to testify that your ex-employer over worked employees or allowed a culture of harassment to exist, then sadly the HR person or hiring manager may worry that you&#x27;d make an accusation against them because those conditions are sadly pervasive and\or subjective. If on the other hand you are testifying that the ex employer is clubbing baby seals to make fancy watch bands, then they are much less likely to care because they know they aren&#x27;t also clubbing baby seals (or if they are, you should be happy they pass on you.)<p>On a personal level, I&#x27;d probably ask them to get a subpoena and testify. I&#x27;m reading between the lines, but it sounds like you think it&#x27;s the right thing to do. If you really believe that then it&#x27;s worth doing, even if it might have s marginal effect on your some job applications down the line.

The web was invented in 1989, popularized in 1995, and arguably the point where people realized &quot;Hey, desktop apps are in trouble&quot; was around 2004 when GMail and Google Maps came out.  Even so, Dropbox was founded in 2007 as a desktop software company, and that hasn&#x27;t stopped them from being worth a few billion.<p>Mobile apps were invented in the 1990s (Newton, Palm), popularized in 2008, and (at least in Silicon Valley) it&#x27;s a big topic of debate whether the web is dead.  In my old job - Google Search - I was still pretty secure as a web guru.

There are still people making a living off of COBOL and IBM mainframes.  In general, consumer markets peak about 5 years after the technology is introduced to the general public (so microcomputer apps came into their own around 1980 with Visicalc, windowing apps around 1990 with MSWord and various office suites, webapps around 2000 with Google etc, mobile just starting to peak now with Uber/Instacart/etc.)  If you&#x27;re founding a startup you need to account for the time it takes to build your product, so in general you want to use technologies not more than 2 years old.

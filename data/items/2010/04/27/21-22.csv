The core OS should be as widely applicable and as open as possible, while any restrictive technologies or licenses should be in as high a layer as possible, so that they affect only those people who want/need them.  The benefit to doing things that way is that all layers become easier to maintain and less prone to failure (DRM being used to blacklist hardware drivers would be considered a failure in this case), because each component in each layer only contains those things necessary for itself and the layers above it.<p>DRM especially should be in as high a layer as possible, or ideally not present at all, so that its casualties are minimal if the authentication servers disappear or the company holding the keys becomes malevolent.",1272405498

The leak was utterly mundane; no one broke into the Apple campus or smuggled anything out, no one bribed or attacked an employee.  As far as we can tell from the story, Apple regularly dresses up its research prototypes and takes them for walks outside.  This practice is so obviously prone to leaks that people are speculating that Apple leaked the phone on purpose.<p>Either Apple had calculated the risk and found it to be acceptable, or they never planned against the possibility of losing the phone.  If the former, then Apple is merely experiencing an inevitable downside of its chosen (wildly successful) development model.

Your GPA, SAT/ACT/GRE scores, IQ, credit rating, college major, average income and choice of university all form an impression on people who want a nice box to put you in, whether you like it or not. Sure, some intelligence is probably required to achieve high rankings in some of those areas, but it isn't indicative by itself of who you are or what you're capable of. To the perceptive crowd on Hacker News, this probably seems obvious, but to most of society, these facts and figures define who you are and what you should do with your life.<p>The best hope for humanity, in this regard, is to judge people on what they contribute or accomplish. This will probably never become a viable paradigm for most people, because it isn't inherently concrete; it's much harder to look at someone's entire life and judge their merit relative to someone else, rather than noting that a 3.5 GPA is higher than a 3.2 GPA.

1299747,comment,1299029,1299276,0,0,gcv,,,"What does skill have to do with anything? Pure programming is an answer in search of questions. Programming helps solve problems, but without knowledge of other fields, a programmer, no matter how good, has no idea what problems to attack.<p>Programmers know a whole lot about... programming. Some people therefore write development tools, IDEs, text editors, compilers, operating systems, and databases. This seems to me a relatively small niche, though. Commercial development tools often live and die by free and open-source competition.<p>Otherwise, without actual domain knowledge, a programmer becomes a tool for people who do possess this knowledge. Typical programming jobs suck because they boil down to pushing data from point A to point B, while transforming it in a way specified by someone else. For example, in the financial industry, a non-quant programmer is just a cog. Possibly a highly intelligent and competent cog, but still never the person who designed the underlying process. On the other hand, a quant with programming ability actually has a chance to do something original. Even traditional ""computer sciencey"" work is rarely just about programming. Computational biology, computational geometry, robotics — those are real fields, where programming helps solve problems.",1272402920

Usually in such a case you can fire up the original machine with the drive attached and load a forensic imager from CD to pull the data (in other words it's a fail safe).

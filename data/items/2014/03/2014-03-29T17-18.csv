I almost always prefer that the site be self-explanatory in just a few seconds as well, but if you&#x27;re not very familiar with Bitcoin, it would be a wall of text to explain what this product is. In this case, I think a video was definitely the way to go.<p>On another note, this looks like an awesome project. I wonder what implications this could have in net neutrality.",1396115986

7493142,comment,7492127,7492982,4,0,inthewoods,,,"What evidence can you present that cable companies are becoming less powerful or relevant?  All I see is cable companies consistently increasing their power vs. content providers.  The latest example being the Netflix/Comcast deal with Netflix paying Comcast.  But there are others: Comcast bidding for Time Warner Cable, Verizon FIOS household numbers stalling (they&#x27;re still a player but not taking much share).  They&#x27;re also becoming more vertically integrated - so buying more content companies themselves.<p>My take is that until there is another viable internet pipe to the home - wireless or fiber optic - the cable companies will continue to be relevant and powerful.  Controlling the last mile to the consumer is just too powerful, especially when you look at how difficult and costly it is to do a new network at scale.",1396115768

If you combine the data from ALL VR EXPERIENCES through facebooks rift(and let me stress this again - we&#x27;re talking about most of today&#x27;s entertainment industry(+education), data the media has been dreaming of for years).. Even if eye-tracking won&#x27;t be implemented, your VR interactions become a very neat addition to all the data - facebook alone - is gathering already - marketable like nothing before. As someone already mentioned here, being the first on the market means(among other things) that I as a potential VR customer won&#x27;t really have options to choose from - my options are FB&#x27;s rift, Sony&#x27;s PS4+VR combo or just to wait for another ~5 years till enough VR parts are lying around so the smaller companies can have a go(although one may still not be able to watch the 360 F1 driver camera &quot;facebook experience&quot; feed from a &quot;asus vr&quot; kit). I&#x27;m fully aware that if most of my family/friends/colleagues/whatnot are on fb, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if I&#x27;m using fb or not - data-wise(don&#x27;t worry - till you are demonstrating in front of the &quot;right&quot; embassy, all is OK .. for now) - but this is a whole new attack vector for privacy.. and propaganda.

You could get investors to put in money - but who knows if Mike Judge is interested in that - he might just want to make a great show.<p>Or you just partner with HBO and get to make the show on a large budget with high end production values, along with HBO&#x27;s very strong promotional arm to push it - and you still get a boatload of money plus residuals.<p>Louis CK can do what he does because he&#x27;s selling a live show - the costs are predicable and one-time (or maybe a few times if he records multiple shows).  Not that there isn&#x27;t some risk - but Louis CK can also offset the cost side by what he gets on ticket sales - so he&#x27;s probably even on the cost side before he even tries to sell it on the internet.<p>TL;DR: You can&#x27;t compare filming a show with filming a series.",1396115121

7492959,comment,7490151,7491499,0,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"I think the differences are far less fundamental than you think.<p>Some places indeed do have unisex toilets nowadays, and while I think few if any people consider separate toilets explicitly offensive, at least so far, they do actually pose a problem for some people, which is why I think it is not unreasonable to consider switching to unisex toilets everywhere. The problem with the current scheme of toilet separation is that there are both people who do not identify as either explicitly male or female, and in particular people who identify as a different gender than their biological one, for those people the scheme doesn&#x27;t really work (and actually sometimes leads to real-world conflicts when they are perceived by others to be overstepping boundaries when they go to the &quot;wrong&quot; toilet). And if you think about it, the separation doesn&#x27;t really make all that much sense. After all, you don&#x27;t have separate toilets at home either, do you? And it&#x27;s not like you couldn&#x27;t have any privacy in public toilets nowadays, which a gender separation might be a crude approximation for.<p>Also, you have to distinguish between enforced categorisations and self-identification. A &quot;ladies night out&quot; probably is not really strictly about genitals, but rather a heuristic description of what kind of activities are planned, so if you happen to be a biologically male transgender, who identifies as female, and who is interested in taking part in that activity, behaving in that social role, you hopefully would not be excluded due to your biology. In particular, there is a difference between (biological) sex and social roles traditionally associated with certain biological sexes, commonly called the gender. This whole fight is not about getting rid of those roles, but rather about the freedom for each individual to choose their role independently of their biology (and also the freedom to reject both roles). Just as you can like or dislike swimming, you can like or dislike behaving according to what is traditionally considered &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; behaviour, and you should be able to choose to behave according to any of those roles as you like to, and not be forced by society to fill one of the roles because of your biology, just as you can freely choose to pursue swimming, or to not pursue swimming. That does not mean that we should ban swimming or &quot;behaving female&quot; or &quot;behaving male&quot;.<p>Also, all of this obviously is not to be confused with a distinction that is based directly on biologically determined differences. If you do only have one kind of genitals, then services for the other kind of genitals probably aren&#x27;t for you, just as pedicure is not for people who don&#x27;t have legs. But that&#x27;s not exactly something that needs regulation or social pressure to enforce.<p>And if you look at it from that perspective, it might actually be more analogous to race than you think: Yes, inviting only white friends would be considered weird. But inviting people &quot;for a day of doing what was traditionally what white people did&quot; (and by that I don&#x27;t mean anything &quot;anti-black&quot; or anything, just typical cultural differences)? You probably would not phrase it that way, but conceptually I don&#x27;t think anyone would find anything wrong with that, and I guess part of why you would not phrase it that way is simply that it&#x27;s the &quot;majority/privileged/normal&quot; thing anyhow, so it&#x27;s unusual to name it explicitly, but looking at it from the other side, consider, for example, &quot;black music&quot;: It would be perfectly fine to have a &quot;black music festival&quot;, but inviting only black musicians or only admitting black audience would be racist, and there also is no stigma anymore for white people to be interested in &quot;black music&quot;, listening to it and even participating in it. It&#x27;s a culture that was traditionally associated with &quot;race&quot;, and we dropped the exclusion, but we still kept the culture, and even name it according to where it came from.<p>As such, I would say: No, gender is different and equal, but separation as it is commonly understood should not have any place there. Just as different kinds of sports are not &quot;separate but equal&quot;. You should be free to engage in any sports activity that you like, and you should be free to engage in any gender role that you like, and just as you usually won&#x27;t find many swimmers swimming in the football stadium, you won&#x27;t find many people into male roles at places where people meet &quot;to be female&quot;, but it&#x27;s noone&#x27;s business to enforce some separation.",1396113310

You may remember you or your parents going to the public library or post office or IRS office to pick up printed forms and instructions, or receiving them in the mail. Today, in most cases, even if (like me) you still do your taxes on paper, you download and print the forms yourself. So the cost of paper and printing has been largely shifted to the individual.",1396112632

That&#x27;s why he proposed that goto should be excluded from all higher-level programming languages.<p>In my comment structured programming refers to using structured syntax to generate goto statements, so you don&#x27;t have to see them or implement them yourself. It should free the programmer of considering those alternative ways of controlling program flow. Presence of goto statement points to a flaw in the language design.<p>To answer your question:\nBecause the basic language I&#x27;m referring to, was on my TI84-plus calculator, and it only had an if-statement (no if-else!).",1396112601

Looks like it&#x27;s a quite recent, from-scratch implementation mainly by one author, with its first release only a few months ago, in September 2013: <a href=""http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2013-09/msg00014.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2013-09/msg00014....</a><p>The author, Jürgen Sauermann, doesn&#x27;t seem to have a web-presence; would be curious what else he&#x27;s up to, besides singlehandedly launching a new APL implementation. Is it a hobby project? Motivated by an existing APL codebase? Part of a research project? He must have quite some experience with APL, since he wrote a PhD thesis on a parallel APL system 25 years ago: <a href=""http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=63307"" rel=""nofollow"">http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=63307</a>",1396112548

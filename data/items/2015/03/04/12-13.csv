The rest of the kids are inside, playing video games or studying.<p>Last summer, my 13 yr old didn&#x27;t see one of his friends face-to-face, but had a summer of playing with them and talking while doing so over Skype.  He went to a bunch of camps, and saw kids his own age there, and spent a week with his cousins, but saw none of his school friends in person.<p>Yeah, it was very disturbing to me, and I tried many times to insist &quot;wouldn&#x27;t you like to have some friends over?&quot; only to hear &quot;no, I&#x27;m good&quot;... several times I thought about forcing him outside, but really, the playgrounds have only young kids with parents hovering over them.  He would have been alone out there.<p>I&#x27;m been saying to anyone that would listen that there will be unintended consequences for this shift.  Dramatic ones.

9143800,comment,9142771,9142771,0,0,ericfontaine,,,"Although most comments use these examples to argue that C is a bad language, I would argue the opposite, that these examples show how C is an extremely useful language.  C has occupied a niche position as the lowest commonly-used language that is both human-readable (at the level of expressing algorithms, data structures, functionality, and control flow) but not specific to any one instruction set architecture (and thus can compile to any architecture).  Each C construct or statement maps efficiently into machine instructions, while not being an assembly language.  I have trouble imagining how to make something like C any lower without becoming architecture-specific or cumbered with details that are more economically-suited for a compiler.  But if too much higher, then the programmer becomes detached from this close relationship to the computer.  The programmer can focus on implementing important speed & space performance details of an algorithm while not getting bogged down by more mundane details (such as register allocation, matching jump statements to their targets labels, keeping track of the return stack of a function, etc.) that are better suited for a compiler to handle.  (That being said, I think Rust or something like it is a strong successor and can additionally express concurrency).<p>These examples illustrate well-intended and useful features of C, not flaws.  I will explain why for each in a comment below:",1425472238

9143789,comment,9142771,9143252,0,0,zamalek,,,"As compiled by the JIT, `v` is a pointer. That is how it is implemented, `v` is not a copy of `{}`, it points to a location of memory that contains `{}`. A pointer is not defined as being &quot;allowed to do arithmetic&quot; it is defined as &quot;points to a location in memory,&quot; no more, no less.<p>> In computer science, a pointer is a programming language object, whose value refers to (or &quot;points to&quot;) another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its address. A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer.[1]<p>We are not being sloppy, in fact we are being extremely correct and precise. Pointers and dereferencing pointers might be implicit and automatic in Javascript but that does not change that a pointer to a value is being used, instead of the value itself.<p>Pointer arithmetic is not the same thing as pointers, it is merely something you might be able to do with pointers if the language you are using supports it. Rust calls its &quot;symbols that reference objects&quot; (what on earth?) pointers, even though you are unable to do pointer arithmetic on them (unless you drop to unsafe). C++ Smart <i>Pointers</i> are called as such even though you can&#x27;t do arithmetic on them.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_%28computer_programming%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_%28computer_programming...</a>",1425471873

9143730,comment,9142925,9143596,0,0,anouk_anca,,,"> the apprentice must simply produce three publishable research papers within the committee&#x27;s set time limit<p>One big issue with the current PhD system is reliance on published articles to determine a student&#x27;s worth, which transforms academia into a paper-churning factory. In your scenario, having a set time limit combined with the low pay will still make candidates rush to publish papers, perpetuating the current issues.<p>Ideally, I would prefer a system like in the Netherlands, where PhD students are considered employees of the university, and get paid close to median wage, and get contributions to a retirement plan. It&#x27;s a demanding job, and should be paid as such. I would also like to see the recommended period for finishing a PhD extended to 7-10 years, ideally spent in 2 or more research institutions. Funding might be a concern, and universities might have to reduce the number of accepted students, but it&#x27;s worth it if it reduces the current pressure to constantly publish. The process of scientific publishing itself needs to be revamped, to encourage publishing of failed hypotheses, or replication of old experiments.",1425470660

Instead, we opted to talk about Google Docs. Unfortunately, the interviewer had been the Google Docs PM, and I’d only used it at a surface level. Every suggestion I made turned out to already be in the Product. Whoops.</i>&quot;<p>To me, this has the smell of the &quot;know it all&quot; interviewer who is more interested in proving their superiority over the candidate than actually conducting a decent interview. Of <i>course</i> the interviewer wanted to stick to discussing the product they were the PM on, how else would they be able to smugly call out the interviewee on their (perfectly reasonable) suggestions?",1425470648

As others have commented, it&#x27;s been the mooted &#x27;next big thing&#x27; for decades. The problem is that raytracing doesn&#x27;t bring any great improvements to graphics. Even the Brigade engine demo that you link looks worse than the current engines.<p>(Although, bonus points to Brigade for <i>not</i> featuring a mirrored sphere in their demo. Every other raytracing demo that I have ever seen adds these in, as if what we&#x27;ve all been missing from our 3d is mirrored spheres! It&#x27;s a sure sign of desperation and lack of imagination when raytracers resort to those :)",1425470569

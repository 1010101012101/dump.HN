The vast majority of web sites out there are powered by shared hosting, where the norm is to cram 1,000 sites on a cPanel server. Apache+PHP makes economic sense in this environment because when your site isn't getting any requests, it uses no resources. But if everybody started running a persistent Django or Rails process in the background, or if every customer had to be given a VPS, hardware and maintenance requirements would quickly exceed what the provider can profitably offer.<p>I can host a small website on NearlyFreeSpeech for $0.30 per month plus bandwidth, even less before they introduced a surcharge for dynamic websites. One of my old clients is hosted on another pay-as-you-go shared host, where she incurs all-inclusive charges of $0.07 per month on average. (The site is mostly static, with a PHP guestbook.) Like it or not, PHP makes this possible by folding the app server into the web server, and a lot of effort has gone into making such an environment reasonably secure without blowing up resource requirements. Even if you use a regular shared host that charges $8.95 per month, that's still cheaper than a medium-quality managed VPS.<p>The current state of shared hosting might not be anything to write home about, but the low cost (compared to a VPS) allows anybody, including dirt poor students, to run a web site without being held hostage to a less customizable service that might or might not exist tomorrow, e.g. Posterous. I think this contributes to technical literacy and independence in a small but unique way. Any realistic alternative to PHP had better meet the same requirements.",1334083505

Hence it will be exponentially more powerful than a turing machine. The possibility of being able to build a physical device that can harness the reals to infinite precision is a <i>big</i> assumption.<p>So this device is an example of a Hypercomputer. Its existence would disprove the Chuch-Turing Hypothesis. It would also be very difficult to verify that it was actually calculating what it claimed [1]. As a hypercomputer it could by definition solve the halting problem. It is also more powerful than a quantum computer.<p>Simple argument: a turing machine can <i>inefficiently</i> simulate a quantum computer. By definition a turing machine cannot simulate a hypercomputer. It could hence compute incomputable functions. And since it could tell whether a program will halt it could compute Chaitins constant. One consequence of that is the resolution of twin prime, goldbach's conjecture and other open number theory problems. It should also be able to compute Solomonoff's Universal prior and hence act in a bayes optimal manner. Strong AI.<p>If what is claimed can be done then this is a very big deal.<p>Some other implicit or explicit arguments in this article:<p>- Human brain is more than a turing maching<p>- turing machine will not be able to realize AI<p>- <i>""Classical computers work sequentially and can only operate in the very orchestrated, specific environments for which they were programmed.""</i><p>I do not buy any of those arguments.

But Valve has proven nimble in the past, so I wouldn't pulling off a transition to the console space past them. After all, Microsoft was able to do it successfully.<p>I think the key difference we'll see between traditional console gaming and the Steam Box (if it materializes) will be a complete elimination of physical media and a corresponding sea change in the pricing models (pretty much the same as what we see on Steam right now). Obviously, existing console makers like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo are loathe to cannibalize existing sales by moving online. But Valve has nothing to lose - even if it cannibalizes some PC game sales, they'll still be making the same (or similar) amount of money.<p>> why would I buy a console (even if it is a Valve one), when I can already play their games on my PC?<p>Remember, Valve is no longer just a game developer - it's also a content distributor for the PC gaming industry at large. Originally, it had to jumpstart Steam with its own titles, which are definitely PC-centric. But now that Steam is an established player in the PC gaming industry, it will be much easier to convince prominent 3rd party console game developers to develop games in advance of the Steam Box's release. Valve no doubt has clear financial data showing the advantages (for game developers, not for the console makers) of shifting to a digital distribution model.",1334082350

This is perhaps the more important part, because if something I write doesn't make sense to you, or a concept is too hard, then <i>the book can't do it's job</i>. The other thing to point out is that by doing this, <i>you will probably be spoiling the entire experience for yourself</i>. I'm not saying that you'll end up in a broken state where you'll never learn how to program, but it might not be as easy as fun to learn as it would be once the book is finished.

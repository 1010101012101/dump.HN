Asking for the monlist takes about 90 bytes, the monlist is about 1640 bytes and since NTP is UDP we can spoof the IP origin and those 1640 bytes will go to your target of choice.

This is the only way in which no one will want to buy coins. In that situation your best bet is sending your coins to an exchange and selling them into the listed buy orders which have not been removed because the person who listed them is either asleep or unaware of the news.<p>However this is incredibly unlikely, bitcoin went though a fork last year that caused some problems but was quickly rectified, this current maleability issue is also being worked on to get a resolution. These sort of network wide problems are problems with the fundamentals of bitcoin and should, by right, affect the price of bitcoin much more than say government regulations in China or India, that they dont is because most holders of bitcoin understand that these problems can be resolved with some dev time and BTC has some great and comitted devs working on it.<p>Namecoin (NMC) had a similar issue where it meant that web addresses linked to NMC were not secure, that caused a crahs but no where near going to zero and that is a coin with minimal developer support.",1392213440

7224237,comment,7222666,7222666,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"#4 seems to be generating a lot of controversy, because the reverse also leads to burnout.<p>First, if you expect every job to last 5+ years, you&#x27;ll often make suboptimal choices when it comes to balancing your own needs vs. the stated corporate objectives. Mistakes #1 (single-project myopia) and #5 (long hours, to the detriment of the rest of one&#x27;s life) occur when people lose the ability to look outside their own jobs. If you have it in your mind that you absolutely must stay with a company for the next 10 years, you&#x27;re much more likely to make those sorts of mistakes.<p>It&#x27;s ideal that you get a good job and it lasts 5+ years, but you have to go to work with the understanding that the world might change on you in an instant.<p>What you need to do is focus <i>always</i> on your career. Try to kick out as much of your work to the open-source world as you can. Network before you need it. You need to play so that if you lose your job tomorrow, you&#x27;ll be OK. Because you just might. It can happen to anyone at any time. If you plan your career properly, though, the next job will be a step up. It&#x27;s when you&#x27;re constantly moving around with no progress-- spending 6 months out of each year &quot;on-boarding&quot; into parochial corporate knowledge instead of career-advancing general knowledge-- that you&#x27;ll burn out.<p>Leaving a job <i>stupidly</i> is a mistake. If you&#x27;re learning a lot and something mildly annoys you, quitting in a huff is the wrong way to go. When you get something good, hold on to it for as long as it lasts. But don&#x27;t throw good time after bad, either, because that will lead to burnout just as quickly.<p>The truth on all of these is that there are tradeoffs. Is it a good idea to work long hours? If a month-long burst of 80-hour effort will buy you career advancement that&#x27;d otherwise take 2 years, then suck it up and work. If it&#x27;s just going to get you more grunt work (which is usually the case) then blow it off. Similarly, with job tenure, I think the poker player&#x27;s maxim-- be very selective, and very aggressive-- applies. Fold losing hands early, but when you have cards (i.e. a job that&#x27;s doing a lot for your career) then play it hard.",1392213327

The problems were about the flow rate of water descending into a tank and what happens when you put a drain here with this rate of flow, etc. Completely different from our earlier problems which could be solved by rote memorization.

If they did, there&#x27;d be no newsgroups, no torrents and no porn. They&#x27;re seizing more control as time goes on, however: See the death of Net Neutrality in the US.<p>I&#x27;d like to see governments pledge to back off from the Internet. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t see that ever happening. Forever pushing for more governance means that the non-government-approved portion will get bigger and erect more walls around it. If governments want to govern, they need to be more accepting of the  &#x27;net in its natural state and deal with it on those terms, rather than forcing citizens to choose to be on the &#x27;light side&#x27; or &#x27;dark side&#x27; (choose for yourself which term applies to which).",1392212364
7224142,comment,7219060,7221056,3,0,nhaehnle,,,"The gold standard is also inconvenient for <i>progressive</i> policies: it removes the floating of currency exchange rates, which tends to act as an automatic stabilizer. See the Eurozone to see how this played out over the last few years, since the Euro has the same technical effect on the member countries. If a country like Spain had had its own currency with a floating exchange rate, that currency would have automatically devalued against other European currencies, which would have acted as a big boost to the Spanish economy via increased exports. Instead, Spain got atrociously high unemployment.<p>The gold standard is just inconvenient, period. It restricts the policy space for governments. This can be a good thing, but in democracies - where the government mostly does act in the interest of the population[0] - I would say that it mostly ends up being a bad thing.<p><i>> FDR temporarily unlinked in 1933 and we had the great depression</i><p>Yes, both of these things happened. The important thing is the <i>order</i> in which they happened: The great depression happened <i>first</i>. Abandoning the gold standard was a somewhat late and indirect reaction to that. In fact, countries recovered roughly in the order in which they abolished the gold standard (see e.g. [1] for references).<p><i>Edit to add:</i> As to the history of coin debasement, I genuinely wonder whether historians have got their causality right. There appears to be a self-reinforcing belief that historically, coin debasement always caused inflation. At a superficial glance, that story seems to fit the data, hence the self-reinforcement. However, there are <i>some</i> episodes in the Roman empire where it seems plausible that causality could have run in the other direction: Inflation came first, and the coins ended up being debased to match the reality of how much (or how little) they were still worth.<p>I know that gold bugs must deny the mere possibility of such a &quot;reverse causality&quot; on quasi-religious grounds, but a sober look at the data leaves quite a lot of room for this. Some of the inflation values use price data that is almost a century apart, and a 5x increase in price <i>over a century</i> is actually relatively modest inflation on a year-over-year basis, if you take the exponential nature of inflation into account. This level of inflation could easily arise endogenously, say out of modest wage-price pressure effects. Changing the coins to adjust to a new reality <i>after a century</i> is then merely reasonable administration.<p>This is not to say that the story of &quot;bad emperor flooded the market with coins to fund wars&quot; never happened. It&#x27;s just to say that perhaps history was sometimes more complicated than what fits into a bug&#x27;s brain.<p>[0] Yes, yes, come at me with your cynicism; and indeed modern democracies are imperfect.

TechWorld&#x27;s news editor gets his phone hacked - and can not do anything about it.<p>A few days ago, TechWorld was contacted by the developer Roman Digerberg, who said he&#x27;d found serious security holes in iOS. Among other things, he asserted that it was possible to send an anonymous text message that appears on the lock screen, even when this is set to not display messages.<p>He also said that it was possible to manipulate the number that denotes the number of voice mail messages,\nor to just put a red dot in place of the indicator, which the user can not remove.\nWhen TechWorld talks to him, he tells us more:<p>How did you discover this?\n- It was by pure chance. I wrote a program in C# for my GPS tracker, which would facilitate the programming of it.\nBy mistake I sent the text message to my iPhone which then began to beep and display strange messages on screen.\nSoon, I realized that I had created a monster.<p>What did you do? \n- I have been in contact with Apple, both via email and phone, but they seem totally uninterested in this.\nI&#x27;ve been thinking about making the source available online. People will start doing harakiri with each other&#x27;s phones,\nbut why should you care about it when not even Apple does?<p>He also reports that he has received offers from several companies that want to buy the software to use it for advertising,\nsince it is next to impossible to ignore the messages that pop up on the screen.<p>He offers to demonstrate how it works and TechWorld&#x27;s news editor gives him his phone number. \nSoon, things start to happen in his phone:<p>[image]<p>Apparently there were lots of people who tried to call in the last minute. However, the voicemail does not have any new messages.<p>[image]<p>But it still says that there were 250 missed calls. And it will not disappear, no matter what we do.<p>Roman Digerberg calls us to check that it worked. During our conversation, he sends another message:<p>[image]<p>Indeed a very good call. But maybe not so fun when ad companies get the technology, starting with mass mailings that\ncan not be ignored or turned off.<p>After taking screenshots, he removes everything in seconds.<p>- You can not remove it, only I can remove it, he explains.<p>He is also sending over examples of much nastier things he can do:<p>[image]<p>So what should we make of this? An extra important call that was missed?<p>Or this, which has great potential to cause heart attacks:<p>[image]<p>He explains, without going further into technical details, that it&#x27;s about manipulating classes in the message structure. Other than sending messages that can not be avoided and manipulating figures for the number of messages, he says that he also managed to lock a phone altogether and that a restart was required to get it working again.<p>- Some think that I should start a paid service where you can anonymously send different types of messages.\nYou can imagine what chaos there would be if people sit and sends unwanted and unavoidable messages to each other and make changes in each other&#x27;s phones.

7224025,comment,7223578,7223578,2,0,VLM,,,"From a chemistry point of view milk is an emulsion of cow fats dispersed in water (and some proteins, and electrolytes, not relevant to this discussion).  Shaking up milk or using a churn breaks the emulsion and you get solid butter.  Strangely about 95% of the population has no idea where butter comes from beyond &quot;it comes from the store&quot;.  Ordinarily water and oil don&#x27;t mix very well.  Some really tasty foods (not just milk) involve oil/water emulsions, sauces, gravys, salad dressings, mayonnaise, to a greater or lesser extent raw baked good doughs, etc.<p>So thats chemistry lesson 1, lesson 2 is &quot;lots of stuff&quot; in o-chem class prefers to partition itself in oil or water phase.  So at least some ochem lab work involves a sep funnel which is a magic, yet simple, way to do liq vs liq extractions.  Stuff moves from being dissolved in liq 1 to being dissolved in liq 2.  Its a law of nature that its impossible for an undergrad lab involving a sep funnel to not have an accident or incident of some sort, usually more funny than dangerous.  Not surprisingly one liquid is usually polar and one is usually non-polar because you can&#x27;t do much of an extraction if liq 1 and liq 2 mix perfectly to create liq 3.  And the sep fraction is often crazy, if you work the polar / nonpolar hard enough.  I would imagine the sep fraction for salt or sugar in water/veg oil could be nearly a million, like the only salt in veg oil might be mechanical turbidity/suspension.  Thats just a guess but I&#x27;m sure its ridiculously high if not a million.  You can still have a &quot;useful at lab scale&quot; extraction if its only a factor of 2 or so, just pointing out its not shocking to be much higher.<p>Anyway the point of this chem discussion is there is no such thing as milk, there&#x27;s a liquid that comes out of a cow and its got all kinds of crazy stuff in it, some of which STRONGLY partitions into either the polar or nonpolar phase.  So the eventual discovery is probably going to be some kind of hormone, protein, mineral, herbicide, antiseptic, antibiotic, pesticide, solvent, &quot;something&quot; that strongly partitions / dissolves into fat and not into water.  In the list above, hormones, herbicides, pesticides, and solvents tend to partition strongly into fat, the other stuff is a tough call one way or the other.<p>I would theorize that other animals living in the same contaminated conditions would partition the same way.  Us mammals are not as biochemically different as some think.  So its entirely possible you&#x27;d get the same effect from eating fatty meat, perhaps bacon, or foods cooked in (or made with) lard.

Second, they are forbidden to be honest about NSA&#x27;s demands and therefore this has hurt their image in the international market-place.<p>Maybe most of us were aware that our communications are intercepted, but we had no idea to what extent that happens. As a non-US citizen, I now think twice about collaborating with US-based companies. And it&#x27;s not because I fear the NSA, I really don&#x27;t, but rather because I&#x27;m thinking that the same backdoors these companies were forced to build can be discovered and used by other organizations that may be closer to home.<p>And even worse than that - as a non-US citizen I am not represented by any of your officials and suing anybody in the US would be totally unfeasible because of costs. The only thing I can do is to loudly complain about it on the Internet or to my acquaintances and that&#x27;s about it. If it were my own government doing this shit - at the very least I&#x27;d have other options.<p>Make no mistake - the credibility of all US-based companies suffers and because of this you will see in the following years a lot of (1) proposals for country-wide Intranets, (2) governments switching to their own forks of open-source software and (3) businesses switching to local software providers and so on. You can already see signs of this happening and it&#x27;s precisely companies like Apple/Google/Microsoft/Yahoo that will take the biggest hit.<p>And I fear that US citizens and officials aren&#x27;t taking this seriously - as if us, non-US citizens should have expected this surveillance, without thinking that the US placed itself as the guardian of the Internet, that trust has now been eroded and the effects (e.g. country-wide Intranets, local software achieving monopoly by government intervention, etc) will be negative for everybody.<p>EDIT: speak of the devil - <a href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-142_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-142_en.htm</a>",1392210633

It has around 30% of calories from fat, as opposed to the 10 - 12% that he advocates. Hence, when we compare a low-carb, high-fat diet against the normal &quot;low-fat&quot; diet, we&#x27;re really just going for a high-fat, high refined carbohydrate diet, which is meaningless.<p>He also points to some studies, and says we need to do more research on the long-term effects of high-fat, low-carb diets:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23372809"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23372809</a><p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d agree with everything yet, and I&#x27;m definitely not vegan...haha.<p>But I&#x27;ve found I&#x27;ve been trying to exercise fairly regularly (cycle to work, swim/run), and keep my portion sizes small.

I thought the primary driver was &quot;I had a problem, this is the fix for my problem, maybe it helps you. I share this solution, you share yours.&quot;. Which basically holds true nowadays: Systemd solves Redhats problems. If it solves enough problems for enough people then it will prevail and other people might enhance it to fix their problems as well if they deem it a viable foundation. If it doesn&#x27;t, then systemd will remain a niche solution that fixes redhats problems - which would totally be fine with me.<p>Given that we have the discussion on the debian list I&#x27;m inclined to believe that at least enough people think systemd is it to give it a push.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this page, especially if it's generating cash. However, something needs to be said for conveying a simple message. ""I have a calendar. The pictures might be of interest to you. Come and buy it from me."" Adding all of the additional text is a distraction from what you want your visitors to do. If they want to buy it, they will. Additional pictures may entice them to dwell on the thought a bit longer. Additional text might do the same thing. But I believe that people prefer visual candy to reading more often than not.

Then folks added static file generation, optionally, behind the scenes. Then techniques like CGI to make it dynamic each request, typically from a C program or Perl script. Anyway...

That is, you are more likely to get a well paying job if you have one.  As a side note, my experience (family members who are HR directors) is that this is very likely true.  However, the effect that this has on the statistics is a real effect, and must be considered when determining the value of obtaining a degree.<p>Your second statement could certainly be a confounding factor when it comes to the stats, but really doesn't support the claim that society would be collectively better off with less emphasis on formal education.  Further, it implies, what I believe to be, an unlikely claim.  That is that the majority of graduates would have been successful without the university experience.<p>I should note here, that I do not, necessarily, support the status quo.  I'm a big fan of programs like 20 under 20, YC, and other micro-funding type programs, and would love to see these types of programs expanded.  The university systems of the world are in dire need of reformation, but that doesn't mean tossing the entire thing out.<p>Changing the way education works has always been a long, slow process, but changes are starting to happen.  Advocating for a ripe-and-replace ""solution"" will only cause the current apparatus to close ranks and take a defensive posture.  We need to work with the education systems, break through that resistance to change,  and move to a system that better suits the needs of today's students, which do differ from students of the past.",1318639448

Unlike most (read all) philosophers, Bergmann actually practices his ideas which are detailed in his book, ""on Being Free"". He talks about such an economy based on producing little and necessary items within communes and trading them amongst each other:<p><a href=""http://newworknewculture.com/content/frithjof-bergmann"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newworknewculture.com/content/frithjof-bergmann</a><p>They are actually applying New Work to various parts of the world including South Africa, Iraq (in Kurdistan) etc. I know this because in undergrad I worked with him on this project for a year.<p>However, the main problem regarding an alternate system is quite philosophical; that what is the basic human condition? Hobbes came up with an answer calling life ""nasty, brutish and short"" and that our animal spritis needed to be kindered. In government we did it through Rousseau's suggestions that we need a system through which we do not kill each other. I don't kill and take your money/land, and you do the same for me. In economics, we came up with an answer through capitalism, and saw the biggest implosion of wealth ever in the 20th century. So it is hard to argue against that capitalistic/democratic mindset unless there is a viable alternative especially in the US, where it has worked the best for the better part of the century. As far as crises go, we have seen destruction and subsequent creation of wealth throughout this century, so that is not a reason to give up I think.<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/10/stockmarket-returns-20th-century"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/10/stockmarke...</a>",1318638180

There's always some problems and since it's all in one package, it's really difficult to remove an item and switch it from something else. (For instance, I know it's far from being the same, but think django and mysql. You can use something else, but anyone who did it will agree with me that it's a lot of problem.)\n\n  2. There are *so many* already existing solutions out there that it's hard to believe that you can make *all of them* better. For instance, Dropbox is pretty awesome, Github is awesome, IRC is awesome, Gmail is awesome. Especially for startups, these are all free or *almost* free solutions.\n\n  3. It's simply impossible to fit everyone's need with a one big solution for everything. I've been in *big company* where you'd have a microsoft based solution with everything, or others thousand of dollars apps to manage authentification and email and everything, and they all truly sucked. And they sucked not because they were wrongly build, but they couldn't be the *best* for everyone. If you want to make it newbie friendly enough, power user will hate it. If you make it complex enough for power user, newbie will be lost and hate it. I know I'm making it sound trivial, but I hope you guess the point. \n\n  4.

How will someone ever know truly how computers work unless they have to fix them piece by piece.""<p>Then, in 1971 you could have pined, ""With the rise of these time-share based operating environments, the future programmer has all the hard things taken care of for them.  All that you need now is a data-bank administrator and record input clerk. There is no future in computing!""<p>Then, in 1981 you could have lamented, ""Baugh!

They will never use a soldering gun or know the joy of assembling a memory board because they will just drop it in the slot. Ug!""<p>Then, in 1991 you could have scoffed, ""well with all these new fancy compilers, nobody will appreciate the joys of directly manipulating registers and stacks. Instead, they will spend their career in higher order abstractions without ever truly knowing the soul of the machine.""<p>Then, in 2001 you could have cried, ""This era of the world wide web is hastening the decline of single system software and entertainment consumption is simply supplanting productivity for the largest use case of computing.

To most people money is something that comes out of a slit in the wall when they insert their plastic card. Some realize that this only keeps working as long as they maintain their job and don't get fired, but some don't consider that possibility either. Money really is life. Most people are born without things to sell, so they can really only procure money by renting out their mind or labor for others to use. One can always make more money but nobody can make more life. Hence, it's somewhat of an optimization problem: How much life to give up to procure enough money in order to make money with money instead of selling one's labor or thoughts.<p>PS: I'm jealous of your liveaboard experience.

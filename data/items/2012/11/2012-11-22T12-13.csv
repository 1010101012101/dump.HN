It's all a matter of trust though, these expert systems are going to have to prove themselves to be superior to human judges (such as in cases of mistrials) before people can trust them.<p>They don't have to have encountered all possible combinations of facts either, machine learning is good at generalizing. In fact, civil law  systems have already codified everything, and the system works. Also having machine-judges doesn't mean we can't add new laws when needed.<p>This system would lead to a whole class of ""artists"" trying to game the system by manipulating the data before feeding it to the machine-judge (a combination of what's already happening in courts + SEO tactics).",1353589175

4818578,comment,4818032,4818375,2,0,twoodfin,,,"This sounds like a chicken-and-egg problem somewhat specific to Mozilla. Their users depend on a large stable of independently developed plugins, which must be updated to support a 64-bit Windows browser. I can imagine that many of those plugin developers are much less motivated to do the requisite porting (or fix 64-bit bugs after they port) before Mozilla ships (or even <i>commits</i> to shipping) a 64-bit Windows browser. But when plugins used by 80%+ of your userbase are nonexistent or buggy, releasing a browser becomes difficult: Everyday users will assume it's buggy because they don't make the distinction between plugin authors and Mozilla.",1353589100

4818570,comment,4818159,4818504,3,0,SquareWheel,,,"I know everybody loves to offer anecdotes when it comes to piracy, but I would never purchase music if I hadn't first downloaded it.  One example, I heard of a band called Imaginary Cities from somebody online.  Gave 'em a download, absolutely loved them.  Sent $10 to the band's Paypal to cover the pirated album.<p>Six months later, I still really love this band.  I go to their website and buy the album digitally.  My thinking being ""I might as well purchase it the right way"".<p>Six months later, they come to my town.  I buy a ticket, and also purchase a physical CD (cause I'm a sucker).<p>I wouldn't have bought their album 3 times if I hadn't been able to pirate it first.  I would have never even heard them play.<p>Now I don't claim this is the case for all the music I download.  A lot of it is terrible (I grab the SXSW compilation every year).  But I would spend far less money on music if I had to buy an album before I could listen it.  And not just a 30 second sample, but enough time to really learn to love it.  I didn't care for the newest Metric album at first, but after enough listens I came to really like it.  The new Jonathan Coulton album, pirated, and again donated directly to him to pay for it.<p>This system may not work for everybody, but it sure works for me.  I can filter out the crap, and pay directly to the artists I love (usually bypassing a huge cut taken from the middle men).<p>So if you have one take-away from this point, it should be to go listen to Imaginary Cities right away.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2L7VT0Vg9E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2L7VT0Vg9E</a><p>And also that the cost of piracy is really hard to quantify.",1353588870

After I found it and researched, it's clear that it's essentially useless[1].<p>I'm not bashing on your project, I like it, but aside from being a cool gimmick, I can't think of any real world usages?<p>...Unless your application is LAN-based , offline-heavy, or your have pixies that run around your office pulling out your network cable regularly * chuckles *.<p>I'll explain, but please correct me if I am way off the mark.<p>The project connects to the network events<p><pre><code>     this.events = {       
        network: ['online', 'offline']
      };
     
</code></pre>
These events fire from observing the attribute<p><pre><code>    window.navigator.onLine
</code></pre>
This attribute returns true, when the system is connected to a network, but returns false when it isn't.<p>The importance of this is that the attribute is inherently unreliable. A computer can be connected to a network without having Internet access. [2]<p>This is a barebones minimal example that doesn't have the features you added:<p><pre><code>   <!DOCTYPE HTML>

         document.getElementById('indicator').textContent =

You can see the fiddle here: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/3rRWK/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/3rRWK/</a><p>If you disconnect yourself from your network you will see the fiddle update to ""Offline"", however, if you pull your phone-line from your router, it will still stay at ""Online"".<p><pre><code>    [1] : It's inherently unreliable.

Take Windows XP vs Windows 7; Windows 7 is miles ahead in the security department, that <i>should</i> be a killer reason for people to upgrade. Or IPv4 vs IPV6 for obvious reasons.<p>But 64-bit has none of these big advantages in practice. Battery life on OS X was <i>worse</i> right after the switch.[1] I have downloaded Podcasts a year before iTunes ran in 64-bit mode and they stopped working with the switch (nothing obscure - early Railscasts episodes). Many perfectly fine machines have been marked obsolete by Apple because their processors or graphics drivers weren't 64bit. - Windows has been a mess for me too: the 64-bit ODBC control panel is in system32 and the 32-bit ODBC control panel is in WoW64.[2] Because there are no fat binaries, casual users suddenly need to know which version of a Windows program to download. - So there is a lot of friction that needs to be outweighed. For <i>what</i>? - If Firefox wants to escape the 2GB barrier, the wiser choice might be to use one process per tab, as other browsers do.<p>If you look at the first and last sentence of your posting, you are basically accusing people of apathy because they keep using their 32-bit computers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forums.appleinsider.com/t/104687/64-bit-safari-reduces-battery-life-by-45"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.appleinsider.com/t/104687/64-bit-safari-reduce...</a> (might also be caused by API changes that Apple has tied to the 64-bit platform)

The truth really is that even seemingly unimportant details such as the size of Ints can mean the difference between a rock-solid 32-bits app and a 64-bits app that's broken almost beyond hope of ever being fixed.<p>If anything, this should be the number one reason for why we must stop using C and C++ for new application developments and even in systems/embedded programming we could do a lot better, as these languages are unsuitable for continued improvements due to Moore's law, impeding progress.<p>Can you see how this creates a vicious circle btw? So we can have affordable consumer workstations with more than 10 GB of RAM right now with multiple cores and all that, which makes client-side development in garbage-collected functional programming languages feasible, but we can't really go there because the 32-bits legacy is holding us back.

This has most definitely not been the case.<p>As for the jobs advertised on sites like jobserve. Most of these require you to work on site as a contractor which right now isn't something I want to do. Freelancing for me is a lifestyle choice, not necessarily a financial one.<p>Again this might change in a few years, I'm getting older and want to start a family, and so this lifestyle might not work for me then.<p>I just hope that my time spent freelancing is seen as a positive on my CV in future, if indeed I do need to make that jump back into full time employment.",1353585867

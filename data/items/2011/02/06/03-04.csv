While obviously nothing is perfect I think the idea of adding weighted cues for skill sets is something missing from the current resume model.""<p>Odesk includes the hours worked on a given project. Even so: I'm not sure that tells me if the programmer has any <i>real</i> fluency. I suppose measures like that and/or certifications are the closest thing to what you're asking for...  But maybe a Topcoder ranking and/or contractor satisfaction index for the sought-after skill set would be more relevant...something/anything which quantifies narrative comments from hiring parties, or contextualizes a programmer among their peers...that would be more valuable to me.<p>""If you were to pair this with a data output that is machine readable, google's problem of 75,000 resume's per week could be significantly made easier to wade through. HR people in enterprise companies look for keywords, bottom line.""<p>People who sift through resumes look for keywords.  Interviewers, hiring managers, <i>business owners</i> look for something else...  How many interviews have you been on where the interviewer picks up the resume, glances at it, sets it down, and then proceeds to ask questions clearly indicating they did not read the resume?  That's the real disconnect in the present resume model. Rather than build a machine readable way to screen fluency, or allow oneself to be charmed by the most visually disruptive document, why not build a better way for employers to simply test--en masse--for certain personal qualities AND technical qualifications? (Heck...deficiencies in psychometrics and testing methodology is a real bottleneck in America's capacity to suss out competency...in any number of domains.  I love tests like the GRE which offer questions, for example, like ""An Apple is to an Orange like a Doctor is to a A) Veternarian, B) Osteopath, C) Architect, or D) Accountant.""  How the hell is someone who's not a native speaker supposed to answer a question like that?)  Often what's needed to get the job done is too subtle to communicate on any number of pages...or ""pages"" as they exist now, and it'd be a stretch for any machine to vibe out a candidate to such an extent. It's probably why video resumes are so useful.",1296964499

I feel like I'm looking at a bunch of ghosts when I view people's profiles now.  Anyone else?  Their photos and a bit of their bios are still up, but they've mostly moved on to other forms of tech to post anything dynamic because of the logical fear that they will no longer control what aspects of their personal lives will become public record.  What, I wonder, is the company doing about this issue beyond just pr stuff like funding privacy-related nonprofits?

2184873,comment,2184495,2184731,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"For the record, I've been crawling the Web since the beginning of DDG (and before the BOSS or the Bing APIs existed). Yes, a one FTE, self-funded search engine, does not have the capacity to spend millions of dollars on crawling (does Google spend billions?).<p>I now focus my crawling efforts where I see they can add significant value, namely on spam removal and zero-click info. Our index actually shows the top result about half the time, which is not from any external API. Given that most people click the top result most of the time, this is not an insignificant addition.<p>We of course use external sources, but I think your comment is too dismissive of the intelligence we've woven on top and through them. I'm not interested in sharing all of DDG's trade secrets just to prove a point, but needless to say, you can simply compare the external APIs to our results across a swath of different types of queries and see the differences.<p>Finally, I find the premise of your comment a bit short-sighted, but I'm actually OK with being dismissed as a toy. In the eyes of the average user, they don't care where results came from at all. They just want the right information faster. So quite frankly, I think it is a reasonable move to use external APIs and focus on things like the top result, UI, etc. More recently, Yahoo and Ask seem to agree. Most people are dismissive of them too, but they've been doing a lot of innovative UI things, which matter a lot to end users.",1296964477

It is the pixel format of the CGImage that matters, not the compression format of the source file. 32bpp premultiplied CGImages are the only format that the GPU will render natively as the contents of a CALayer. Since all JPEGs decode to 24bpp and most PNGs are saved as 32bpp, it's easy to see why this would be confused.

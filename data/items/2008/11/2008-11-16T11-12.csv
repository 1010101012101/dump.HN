This is what happens with fiat money.</i><p>Depending on what other goods were spent to build the house, the total value in the world could increase or decrease. Does your system burn some paper money to reflect that?",1226836121
365964,comment,364798,365152,0,0,gaius,,,"That is true, but the volume of useful work that can be done on a computer doesn't decrease; the slowness is almost always in the user interface portion, not the computation.<p>Obviously this is different in fields were people actually are constrained by their processors and staying on the cutting edge is a competitive advantage. We have a couple of apps like that (e.g. Monte Carlo simulations where we can basically eat as much power as we can get) but for most people (including me), most of the time, computers became ""good enough"" for work on the desktop 10-15 years ago.",1226836062
365963,comment,365695,365873,0,0,Maktab,,,"That's not really correct. There's still no word on whether he'll be allowed to send and receive emails directly during his term(s) as president. The chances are that the risks will be considered too high to permit it.<p>If that happens, he'll be in the same position as George W. Bush, who was a fairly prolific emailer before becoming president but was not permitted to use the technology directly while in office.<p>As an aside, it may not always be a good thing. South Africa's former president Thabo Mbeki was quite well known for having a computer at his desk and a personal email account while in office. Unfortunately, he tended to use his to research crank AIDS activists online, write raving and offensive weekly newsletters on his party's official website and send off diplomatically-unsound emails to newspapers, unpopular researchers and other world leaders. Perhaps it is better to keep a president isolated to some extent.",1226836055

Also, consider that if that German hadn't invented the automobile, Ford still would have.  i.e. Ford wasn't inspired by that German, because he was already working on an automobile.  His autobiography is very good:  <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/hnfrd10.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/hnfrd10.txt</a>",1226835976

The purpose of a format is to represent content, and that's what PDF/DOC does.<p>Also, in regards to your other point, I find Dropbox's ""copy public link"" mechanism to be a far easier way to share content than to upload it to any website (not just scribd), because I don't have to use a browser in the first place.  The content is already uploaded and ready to be shared.",1226835646

The answer could be simple: maybe you are looking at the sky.<p>When I graduated in a, say, 50 people class, 4 of them were women.

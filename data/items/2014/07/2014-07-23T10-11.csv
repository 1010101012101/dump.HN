A few precious comments stuck in there can help the next guy, months or years later, figure out what the heck your original intent was or why a block of code exists at all.<p>As I get older, I find it helps me remember what I was doing.<p>One of my software developer friends was fond of saying:  &quot;the worst code I ever saw was my own!&quot;<p>YES if your code is clean and elegant and well named and clear you don&#x27;t need to explain anything in common language.<p>YES you should strive for such.<p>However, the REALITY is your code sucks and no one is going to  want to have to figure out what the heck you were doing.  A few comments would really help.<p>The next reality is that the typical developer may be literate in a dozen or more languages and the language du jour that you coded so elegantly in has fallen out of favor and no one remembers those dusty corners you so beautifully exploited to make something work.<p>Comments would help even more if you learn to use some basic grammar and spelling when you create your comments.  (It doesn&#x27;t have to be literature, but try to make your comments as readable as you think your code is - please!)  Nothing will turn another developer off to trying to decipher your code than a few comments that make you look like a moron.<p>Style guides that eschew comments, IMO, are counterproductive.  They feed on the developer&#x27;s ego and disregard reality.<p>Comments cost essentially nothing to add to your code and can save it from an early death and complete refactoring by the next guy who comes along.",1406112769

Martin&#x27;s Clean Code book has a great section on comments:<p>- The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code. Comments are always failures. We must have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them, but their use is not a cause for celebration. So when you find yourself in a position where you need to write a comment, think it through and see whether there isn’t some way to turn the tables and express yourself in code.<p>- The older a comment is, and the farther away it is from the code it describes, the more likely it is to be just plain wrong. The reason is simple. Programmers can’t realistically maintain them.<p>- Comments Do Not Make Up for Bad Code! One of the more common motivations for writing comments is bad code. We write a module and we know it is confusing and disorganized. We know it’s a mess. So we say to ourselves, “Ooh, I’d better comment that!” No! You’d better clean it! Clear and expressive code with few comments is far superior to cluttered and complex code with lots of comments. Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you’ve made, spend it cleaning that mess.<p>```\n// Bad:<p><pre><code>    // Check to see if the employee is eligible for full benefits\n        if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) &&\n        (employee.age > 65))\n\n    // Good:\n    if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits())</code></pre>\n```",1406111662

These articles are not about how each and every single man harrassed, raped or killed a woman.  It&#x27;s the other way around: it&#x27;s women saying &quot;I&#x27;ve been harrassed, threatenned, or raped, in my life: is this a coincidence that it was always by men or is there something broken in our society&quot;. I think that generalization over &quot;all men&quot; comes from one&#x27;s identification with the harassers (because you are a man, not because you are an harasser), not from the article itself. Feeling accused and then trying to dismiss such calls for help is really counter-productive, especially if you agree that women face harassment.<p>I don&#x27;t get how you take a testimony of people enduring such violence and turn it into men being the real victims of such articles. &quot;Men are much more likely to be accused of rape and murder&quot;, as someone said earlier. Can&#x27;t you see how twisted that is?

8073585,comment,8070215,8072467,4,0,m4x,,,"There are a few reasons for not using DC until the last metre or so.<p>First of all, you want to avoid having multiple wiring systems in one building. Wiring a building for 110V alone is expensive enough (both initially and later during maintenance). In the vast majority of situations, you are going to have to pick one or the other.<p>So: AC or DC? Either way, you need to be able to run high power appliances (e.g. a 2000W kettle), and to keep losses in your cables low you need to use as high a voltage as possible, which will keep the required current as low as possible. So either way, in a realistic scenario, you need to retain the high voltages (110/230V) that we currently use.<p>When you require high power / high voltages, AC is a better solution. It is easier to switch (your kettle switch will burn out much more quickly while trying to interrupt a high current DC supply than it will interrupting an AC supply that crosses 0V 100 times per second). Overload devices work more reliably with AC for the same reason (which makes your house less likely to burn down). AC also makes it much easier to transform voltage levels - you just use an inductor or two. DC requires relatively complex electronics. DC distribution is also more complicated since the the distribution network and everything attached to it has parasitic (or deliberate) inductance and changes in load produce voltage spikes<p>There&#x27;s nothing to stop you from installing a DC system in your house, but I think you would find it significantly less practical than you had imagined<p>Minor nitpick: relatively few quality solar panels generate \n12Vdc. Most generate around 40V",1406110428

Most of the time I&#x27;m $75-$100/hr, but that&#x27;s still a lot of cash.)<p>Now, there are reasons to stick the cash under your mattress (or in an index fund) - that&#x27;s not the choice I made, though;  I chose to buy some means of production and manage those means of production myself.   Not real-estate;servers.

Estimating the value of a small company is difficult, and one could reasonably value my company at a level where I have done okay (not never work again okay, but at least buy a nicer condo okay)   -  you could also reasonably value the company at the &#x27;buy a compact car&#x27; level.     The only solid offers I&#x27;ve gotten were earn-outs that were heavily dependent on me sticking around for years, so it&#x27;s unclear how much of that is the company and how much of that is, you know, me.<p>But yeah;  the other option would have been to just contract half-time  and spend the rest of that time hanging out in social situations.   That would also have been a really interesting experience.   Maybe it would have been better than what I did?

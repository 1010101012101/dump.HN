Hickey says instead you should reason about your programming without acknowledging that testing and type-checking are ways to have executable documentation of your reasoning about your program. Testing does in fact feedback into complexity - if something is hard to test it may be due to complexity that you realize you should get rid of.",1319129988

For example passenger jet speed was once thought to continue at a rapid rate such that LA to Europe flights would be a few hours.  Skyscraper height was thought to continue, with advances in various technologies and engineering methods making it desirable.  Both hit realities that signficantly slowed down their progress.<p>I tend to side with Allen on this.

3135706,comment,3131439,3131439,1,0,Don_Wallace,,,"This article is mean spirited, too serious and not well written.<p>Bad programmers I have known generally:<p>- Are oblivious and clueless. They just lack cleverness.<p>- They lack problem solving abilities and willingness to solve problems.<p>- They are usually slow witted.<p>- They are very conventional-minded - external approval means a lot to them.<p>- They are willing and ready to work too hard at programming for a result.<p>- They lack abstract reasoning skills.<p>And most bad programmers don't like Star Trek or science fiction, but I can't figure out why other than simple correlation with the mindset of a programmer.<p>The first set of six ""real"" causes pretty much encapsulate 99% of the mediocrity I've witnessed in industry in this field. Bad programmers usually have two or more of these problems. Even one of them is a serious problem if you are looking for a great developer.<p>All other badness, such as ""meal ticket"" thinking, usually radiates outward from these things.<p>I say this because if you lack the quickness and the desire to seek simple and elegant solutions, the work becomes like drudgery and your work reflects the other deficiencies that the article described.<p>A specific example: if you care too much what non programmers think (including your managers) and if you are a bit of a toady, you will not take the time to learn what is going on in-depth, and you will look for quick solutions. So it's important to strategically ignore your bosses from time to time and if you are trying to be politically popular, software development isn't a good place for this.<p>Another example: if you ""want"" to work very, very hard, you will not seek ways to simplify the code. You will instead cope with growing complexity and spaghetti.<p>I question the article writer's programmer instincts because he did not figure out a much more efficient and concise way of expressing the same things. Above all else, a real programmer figures out how to say it just once - not repeatedly cast in different ways.",1319129906
3135705,comment,3134577,3134577,7,0,api,,,"Another response:<p>Kurzweil also ignores economics. The advance of technology is driven in part by economic forces. Computing power may stagnate not because we have reached physical limits but because present-day computers are good enough for what 98% of the market wants.<p>I see this trend developing. If anything, the trend in consumer computing is toward <i>less powerful</i> but lower-power and more portable computing devices. My current laptop -- a Macbook Air -- is actually slower than my previous laptop. But it is more portable and uses less energy. And it does everything I want. I don't need more power right now.<p>The only areas driving the performance end are gaming, high performance computing, and high-capacity data centers. How long will those go until they too are basically satiated?<p>We've seen this in other areas. The envelope for aviation maxed out in the 1970s with things like the U2. Space flight seems to just now be emerging from a long coma with things like SpaceX, but on closer examination SpaceX is just reviving 1960s ideas and doing them at a lower cost with modern control systems and materials technology.<p>My other reply about energy deals with supply-side limits to growth.

3135687,comment,3134577,3134577,17,0,api,,,"What about energy?<p>It's true that if you look at most areas of technology they are advancing rapidly. Except energy. Energy has stagnated since the 1950s.<p>I'm on the fence on this issue, but there are many very intelligent and knowledgeable people who are predicting a kind of anti-singularity: in the 21st century, fossil fuel depletion will send us way back, perhaps even de-industrialize most societies.<p>Is our civilization simply a machine that is transferring the order (low entropy state) in fossil fuels into order within itself (technology and economic complexity), and when those fossil fuels run out will this ordering process cease?<p>The lack of major breakthroughs in energy in the past 50 years is pretty dramatic. Nuclear looked like an energy panacea once, but it's turned out to be clunky and hard to scale. Solar panels and wind turbines are interesting, but the problem with those is that we basically can't store energy. Energy storage is either super-expensive per kilowatt-hour and not scalable (e.g. Li-Ion batteries) or very inefficient (e.g. water electrolysis to hydrogen).<p>Without a breakthrough on the order of cheap ultra-capacitors or fusion, I'm afraid we'll be seeing peak everything pretty soon, including technological complexity.<p>The thing is: all the technologies of the ""singularity"" are energy consumers. Where are the producers? What is going to power the singularity?<p>Then there's another area that makes me horribly pessimistic: politics. Most of our societies are degenerating to banana republic levels of corruption. Even if the energy problem is technically solvable, it seems to me that our political systems may be set up to do the absolute worst possible thing in this area: ride the fossil fuel crash into the ground in an orgy of war and despotism.",1319129448

I think his gift for creating a compelling vision tends to make people forget that the null hypothesis for a scientific assertion is doubt.<p>Kurzweil provides both high level general evidence (like improvements in computation) and low level, domain-specific evidence (like the discussion about the pancreas) to support his claims, but none of that justifies the use of the word ""law"" in ""law of accelerating returns"". He attempts an analogy with thermodynamic laws and how they are derived from underlying statistical principles, but there are no underlying fundamental principles of human innovation and progress that are in any way comparable to the certainty and universality of physical laws. This, I think, is why a lot of people (myself included) have a hard time taking him seriously. He tries to apply the same kind of formal analysis that works well in science to human beings and the complex, highly non-scientific processes that underly innovation today. The bottom line is that, until the singularity occurs, human beings will still be needed to build ever more complex and powerful systems, but human beings do not progress at anything close to an exponential rate.",1319128887

Thermodynamics laws are nothing like predictions about the future.

Much, much faster the before!

I don't know if he has just never bothered to look into the latest research or if his understandably strong desire to not die has resulted in a huge confirmation bias.<p>When Kurzweil talks about the general trend of scientific progress I tend to agree with him.

According to an article on ""color for developers"" that was posted at some point on HN, one gets a better ""pop"" contrast if there is a smidgeon of color.  As I read it, using white or black, regardless of the other color involved in the combo, is less effective.  One should strive instead to add at least a little bit of color and contrast that color with the other.  For example, if you toss a tiny bit of blue into your black, then you should toss a tiny bit of yellow/orange into your white.  The contrast is not in symmetric values either; R, G, and B have different contributions to the brightness.<p>If I have the time to dig up the article I am thinking about, I will add it to this post.<p>(Here is the HN thread on the contrastrebellion site: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2807047"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2807047</a>)",1319128139

However, some countries make it downright impossible for a foreigner to become a resident or a citizen, while others make it exceedingly easy.<p>For instance, if you wanted to become a permanent resident or a citizen to the Dominican Republic, all you would have to do is get there (via sea or air), go through the motions, submit the paperwork and pay the taxes.<p>You would start by buying a US$10 tourist card, as a permit to enter the country, which will be approved unless you are obviously wanted by Interpol.<p>This will give you 60 days, during which you can apply for your provisional resident visa. For the resident visa you will need to provide, aside from the usual forms and tax payments, proof of solvency, defined as about 13k dollars in assets (cash and property) at the current exchange rate, and a letter of sponsorship from any good-faith Dominican citizen with in-country legal residence.<p>Within the first two months after this visa you can apply for a provisional residency card. About four months after the application, you receive your provisional residency card, which lasts a year. At about the year mark, it does not matter much if it happens before or after, you can apply for your permanent residency card. That last one lasts 3 years and is indefinitely renewable (as long as you do not commit a horrible crime).<p>After two years of uninterrupted legal residency in the country (i.e. at least six months and one day per year) you can apply for naturalization.<p>All the while, you are free to engage in productive business from day one. You would be taxed differently, on account of not being a citizen, but you would be allowed to work for a profit. If you happen to aquire assets in-country, there is leeway to have the sponsorship requirements waived.<p>Legal translations, medical examinations and notary public fees carry the burden of the cost of the process. Taxes will run you up less than $100 in total. The entire process is fairly inexpensive and could probably be done with less than $1000 dollars.",1319127340

There are at least two reasons for expecting people to read long forms:<p>1) Sometimes you need to tell a story to get people to see a point. Merely stating the facts won't do it. You need to slowly lead them somewhere, while drawing a landscape, pointing out some of the pitfalls they would have pointed out, telling them how you avoided them. You need time to draw people into your line of thinking let something sink in<p>It's much like with security issues: if you report them, nothing happens. If you extract the details of a thousand customers and present those, people get upset and take action. The first approach is short and to the point, but does not achieve the goal, but the goal is inherently inachievable by short-and-to-the-point approaches.<p>I know I've been persuaded by stories where short factual statements didn't succeed, because I didn't take the time to turn the facts into the story for myself.<p>2) If short reports are good enough for the CTO, any manager between you and the CTO will think short reports are good enough for him as well. You will never get the chance to make a subtle point that requires some paragraphs, because <i>nobody</i> will read it.<p>There is a general complaints about a cultural change in this direction that the internet supposedly induced, but I believe it started much earlier, with the growth of megacorporations where people were expected to consume more information than they could possibly handle.<p>To cope, they started to consume summaries by supposedly smart advisors that they trusted. However, they also get to randomly disregard such summaries when they feel like it (out of intuition if we're being generous), because they can always say ""well, it's actually complex"" and they get to excuse themselves in the same way. Short reports often actually aren't good enough at all, but we've learned to live with it, because some wrong decisions are better than no decisions at all.<p>There is a way in between, where you sometimes, when the issue is important enough, do read the long form. Even top-level CEO's may be interested in an 800 page book on 'The better angels of our nature'. Yegge may be important enough, and his subject matter may be important enough, that Brin should actually read it entirely.",1319126954

Last time I visited (March this year) I went through LAX. I was greeted very nicely by the officer, had all my paperwork done and off I went. Then I went to Baja California (MX) where I would stay at a friends/client house.<p>Then I had to cross the border (through Tijuana) to go to a marketing expo at AZ. The experience was nerve-wrecking. The border patrol officer started telling me I was hiding something because of my body language (apparently he saw too much ""Lie to me"") and started questioning why I had friends in the US, how had I met them and so on. After about 20 minutes we were let go.
Like I said, I've worked at immigration in my home country, so I know how it works and stuff, but there are more professional ways to handle matters than just accuse people, push and see if they bite.<p>Also, what I missed to add to my comment above... In (most) mainstream US movies, you see that no matter what your job is you can lead a pretty nice life. Even if you work as a bartender, you can have your small apartment and be in charge of your life.
I don't think it works like that. I met a client that was a school teacher and he was broke. Some of my clients have declared for bankruptcy, and some very, very rich clients have lost a lot of RE and have to downsize their homes by an order of magnitude.<p>I know it works like that pretty much everywhere, but for some reason all this things I imagined as a kid, stuck with me until I visited the US. It's like deep down we hope there's a place were things are better, and the US could be that place; so we buy into the dream (until we realize it was a dream and there's no such place).",1319126729

3135438,comment,3134707,3134843,12,0,MatthewPhillips,,,"That goes against the principle of open-source. The principle is that by releasing code to the public you will get contributions from others (an extra set of eyes) that will make the project overall better.<p>But to accept this principle to have to also accept that some people will take your code and use it in ways that you don't approve. The hope/belief is that the good will float to the top. If you don't accept this premise then you don't really have an open-source project.<p>I can't figure out why Android open sources its code, ever. They don't seem to care about contributions from the community, and they obviously don't want people using their code in ways they disapprove of.  It seems that the major reason for open sourcing their code must be something else. What I keep coming back to is that it somehow protects them (in most cases) of patent violations.<p>I've asked this in the past: what is Andy Rubin's open-source credentials?  What open-source projects has he been involved in during his long and successful career?",1319126493

You can still apply the same theory within computing, though.  For example, a lot of people start out wanting to invent their own programming language, both to ""scratch an itch"" and because it's a pretty high-status gig.  Then they get bogged down implementing libraries and fielding requests for new language features and I'm sure it's no longer so much fun.  By contrast, databases or filesystems might seem boring to use but there's actually a lot of exciting work going on under the covers.  We even have our own equivalent of the B&B scenario, with people who want to develop cool web stuff and then find they have to spend most of their time on the underlying functionality (assuming they have any worth speaking about).

I actually think the most appropriate benchmark is memory bandwidth, which hasn't been improving as fast as FLOPS or storage capacity. It's not a matter of running a strong AI at 1/100 speed on today's fastest supercomputer. It would be more like 1 billionth or trillionth speed.<p>The reason for our disappointingly slow progress in AI over the years is that our hardware is still nowhere near powerful enough to usefully implement the same algorithms as the brain, and we likely won't even develop the right algorithms until we have hardware closer to the requirements, so we can test and iterate.",1319126405

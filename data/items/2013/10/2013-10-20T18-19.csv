It just wouldn&#x27;t be possible to make a comprehensive case for perl in a blog post this short, because perl does much more than awk does.<p>And that&#x27;s kind of why I like awk as much as I do, in spite of its limitations. There&#x27;s so little to the language, it&#x27;s of practical use, and as a precursor to tools like perl, python, and ruby, it&#x27;s historically interesting, too. And I know a lot of people who like to learn neat, useful things who don&#x27;t know anything about awk.<p>Thanks for reading, btw - I think perl is another older tool that could stand for some evangelizing. I don&#x27;t write perl, though, so I&#x27;m not the guy to do it.",1382295598

That&#x27;s skating to where the puck was 20 years ago.<p>They&#x27;re not aiming to be RAW killers and OpenEXR killers. They&#x27;re not making anything new possible, they&#x27;re just polishing the same old thing.<p>Photographers are increasingly avoiding JPEG because of limited dynamic range it has. WebP (due to its video heritage) has even lower dynamic range than JPEG and can&#x27;t preserve full resolution of chroma channels.<p>JPEG-killers add simple alpha channel that 17-year-old PNG has, but nobody even thought about adding alpha with blending modes (e.g additive, to be able to create lights, or per-channel to be able to represent subpixel AA).<p>After all these years there still isn&#x27;t a format that can save a Photoshop layer and represent non-trivially blended transparency correctly (closest you can get is images wrapped in SVG with filters, uhh).",1382295588
6581018,comment,6580309,6580309,3,0,jgoldsmith,,,"I&#x27;m a relatively new Strava user, and so far I have found it to be very helpful and motivational in my adventures into cycling. As an inexperienced rider, I&#x27;m usually a couple hundred spots down from the leaderboard, so seeing the fastest riders serves only to inspire me to push harder on my own rides. Without this motivation, I doubt that I would try as hard as I do on my recorded rides, so there is no question in my mind that Strava is at least partially a beneficial force.<p>However, there are certainly times on downhill segments where I have seen fastest time and shaken my head at the ridiculous speeds the riders had to go to win. I&#x27;ve marked my fair share of dangerous segments and I believe that is the users&#x27; responsibility to do so to prevent insane accidents like the ones listed in this article.<p>While I feel complete sympathy for the families of these victims, I don&#x27;t believe that Strava is at all responsible for what they did. It was illegal, inconsiderate, and gives every other rider a bad name, and regardless of any leaderboards they may have been striving for they should have had more self restraint. Furthermore, I believe that cyclists like that would push themselves to speeds like that regardless of Strava, whether to beat their friends or just set personal records. Just like many other web apps, Strava provides a service that opens up data, and it is up to the user to use the data responsibly.",1382295586

As opposed to Win8, which was quite sincerely negative, and costs you the consumer money.<p>The OS can die and disappear. And ChromeOS is a waypoint along that road, helping the desktop vanish out from under us. Most consumers are happy running web browsers 80% of the time and nothing else.

But the desktop platform&#x27;s relevance has vanished. ChromeOS heralds that in.<p>The author clearly has not made any attempt to live with a Chromebook. Certainly not all apps are offline capable, but increasingly so they are, and particularly the vital ones that you&#x27;d need to do normal desktop type work.<p>Certainly some people DO need real applications and do need the OS they&#x27;ve always known so they can run the enterprise apps they need to run.

Their target market is non-tech-savvy teenagers and university students who only ever use/need to use SaaS (but don&#x27;t know it). They want something stylish but functional. If somebody in that market asks you to demonstrate it, they will buy it over 90% of the time in my experience (granted, not a particularly scientific trial, but there you have it.)<p>Why? Three main reasons.<p>(i) Price - the next cheapest laptop will tend to start at 279, 299, and it will have some crappy Celeron chip in it. You can start looking at paying 120 more for something with even slightly comparable speed. Then MS office costs at least 79 quid, and that&#x27;s only for a year&#x27;s subscription. 120 quid if you want a permanent activation. Then you will probably be pushed to sell them Norton AV for 25 quid also (due to my strong moral principles(!) I never actually pushed this sale - the store I worked at were probably quite happy to see the back of me)<p>(ii) Ease of use - Google docs + Drive offline is an excellent product, you can do just about anything that the casual education or light productivity user will really easy. No confusing ribbon interface or being overloaded with options.<p>(iii) Quality - supported by a known brand (Samsung), with fast flash memory, a fast ARM processor and a nice anti-glare IPS display. You will get none of those things in any of the Windows models we sold (all under 500, granted)<p>The author of the article, Gabe Knuth, is a full-time tech pro with 12 years experience in application virtualisation on MS and Citrix platforms, according to his profile on the site.

There&#x27;s a direct quote in paragraph 5 from the chick-fil-a &quot;director of hospitality&quot;, the only other quote from a restaurant owner is from a smaller local shop 3 or 4 paragraphs down. The chick-fil-a representatives quote is a comment on the value and reasoning behind pay-it-forward, the other&#x27;s is simply a factual one about a lady at his store that does it.<p>4. Getting a bit more abstract here, but this is exactly the kind of ideal that chick-fil-a probably wants to be associated with, &quot;good-old down home people helping each other out small town america &c.&quot;.

Looking at the history and the content, I seriously doubt it.<p>Now, if you don&#x27;t care for how Wikipedia&#x27;s reliance on third party sources bends content... well, there&#x27;s not much anyone can do to help you. That&#x27;s a problem of the media environment Wikipedia exists in, and you haven&#x27;t really proposed a viable alternative to relying on secondary source material. The way we correct for bias in sources is to use more sources, and be selective about ones we use, taking in to account the fact that some are highly unreliable.<p>In the end, if you have a problem with how Wikipedia relies on certain sources or what it says on certain articles, there&#x27;s an easy solution: edit the damn thing. I don&#x27;t particularly care about the Miley Cyrus article, but if I did, I&#x27;d be doing something about it.

Chick-fil-a being the main restaurant talked about in a feel good article like this is great PR for them, discounting the possibility of it having been arranged deliberately just because the op was overly cynical is a bit petulant. PR is almost never about making things up, but rather the timing and the tone and the things mentioned in the periphery of the story. PR firms know that a straight-up story on how chick-fil-a is great is not likely to do much for them with world-weary americans, but a feel good story about people helping each other (which may very well have happened) with chick-fil-a strategically placed just in the background is great.",1382292277

  So is it largest based upon volume or size or weight or it being 100% dedicated weapon?

This allowed the capture of St Eloi by the British 41st Division.[20]
This choice reduced the total explosive to 450 tonnes.

6580768,comment,6580333,6580333,30,0,tokenadult,,,"My experience as a Wikipedian suggests that Wikipedia&#x27;s administrators need to be much more alert than they have been to the possibility that the Wikipedians motivated by money (or by ideological bias) will stay with the project and persist in making edits contrary to Wikipedia policy. They edit more articles, and edit in greater numbers, than most admins guess or notice. And the point-of-view-pushing editors often inject so much wikidrama into discussions about how to improve articles that they drive away the participation of conscientious editors who know reliable sources about the article topics.<p>A current example is the article on Rupert Sheldrake,[1] which has recently been subjected to vigorous edit-warring, perhaps as part of a publicity campaign by followers of Sheldrake. (I just saw a new book by Sheldrake at a library yesterday, and perhaps that book&#x27;s publication set the timing for the editing push.) But there are examples like this all over Wikipedia, and, again, I think most casual users of Wikipedia massively underestimate the percentage of articles that are edited mostly in the interest of pushing a point of view for commercial or ideological reasons.<p>The article kindly submitted here says, &quot;Anyone can edit Wikipedia, but only a carefully vetted few are promoted to admin status on the site.&quot; And that is laughable. Describing the current group of Wikipedia as &quot;a carefully vetted few&quot; does violence to the English language. Nothing has ever been careful about the process for checking the background of administrator candidates or choosing which candidates become administrators. There are some very, very, very good administrators on Wikipedia (just as there are many very helpful everyday volunteer editors), but there are other administrators who are power trips to maintain conduct contrary to Wikipedia policies for building a good, free online encyclopedia. The Vice article submitted here does, at least, link to an Atlantic article[2] reporting that Wikipedia&#x27;s rate of bringing new administrators on board is slowing. At least some of the administrators have been caught taking payoffs for editing articles to publicize the persons making the payoffs, so it will take more than just the current administrators being more alert to fix this problem on Wikipedia.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Sheldrake"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Sheldrake</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/3-charts-that-show-how-wikipedia-is-running-out-of-admins/259829/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/3-char...</a>",1382292165

It is a flawed test for the importance of a subject.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s best interpreted as a test for the <i>importance</i> of a subject, although I&#x27;ll admit that some Wikipedians do view it that way, and some policy pages (especially older ones) seem to do so as well. To me the more defensible line is just that it&#x27;s a test of whether there exist sufficient sources for an article with its information properly cited to be written at all. If there are halfway decent third-party sources, one can be written, of some kind of level of quality, transitively dependent on the quality of those sources. If there are no decent third-party sources at all, then there is no basis for writing an article, since Wikipedia articles are supposed to be verifiable, i.e. everything they claim should be cited to something other than Wikipedia itself (and not the personal knowledge of the Wikipedian who wrote the article, either).<p>I wrote a longish essay arguing this in some more detail, that the &#x27;verifiability&#x27; guideline has basically swallowed the &#x27;notability&#x27; guideline in practice. But this leaves a gap of things that are clearly notable, but lack good sources about them. In that case Wikipedia is stuck between not covering a notable subject (bad), or covering it in an article that isn&#x27;t properly cited (also bad). <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability...</a><p>The reverse case, where a not-really-notable subject is covered because there are sources, I feel is less bad. If the external world is writing about a subject, then imo it&#x27;s fine that Wikipedia summarizes what they have said about it. At the very least, many such things (like celebrity missing-child cases and vaporware tech companies and whatnot) are meta-notable for the media attention.",1382292134

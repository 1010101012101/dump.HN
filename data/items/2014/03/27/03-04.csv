7478507,comment,7478414,7478414,3,0,sirchimp,,,"We at VeriClock are using Twilio for our product (employee time tracking - the punch in/out by phone call/SMS component is where Twilio comes in).<p>As far as demand goes, we&#x27;re seeing very positive uptake of the service.  Pretty much everyone has a cell phone these days, so the value proposition to our customer (amongst others) is that there is no need to buy custom time keeping hardware.<p>When we were initially building this out, we evaluated Voxeo, Plum Voice, Twilio, as well as doing it ourselves with Asterisk.<p>Voxeo and Plum Voice both seemed solid, but looked to be targeting a different customer than a startup.  Pricing doesn&#x27;t start becoming reasonable until very high volumes can be committed to.  Voxeo had a self hosted version of their product that was quite interesting, requiring a one time upfront cost and then you simply hookup your own VOIP connection.  The cost was still going to be prohibitive in our case since we needed a large amount of concurrent capacity to handle a few hours of peak usage during the day.<p>Twilio was very easy to use, and the price was almost on par with the big guy&#x27;s high volume prices, but without the need to commit to $50k/mo in spending.  Those two things combined really made the decision.  We were a little worried about the up-time, as the sales effort from the big guys tried to scare us away from Twilio.  In the end uptime has been quite good, with only a few minor glitches here and there, usually localized to a specific carrier in a specific region.<p>Plivo was not around at the time.  It looks fairly similar to Twilio, but I have not fully evaluated it.<p>Another service that looks promising is Tropo (owned by Voxeo if I&#x27;m not mistaken, and running on their platform).  Its much closer to Twilio in pricing, and had a pretty nice API as I recall.<p>I would recommend one of those three for a startup - Twilio, Plivo, or Tropo.  The price point makes it worth while.  If you get traction and have a viable business model, and feel the reliability isn&#x27;t quite there, you can try another service.  But you risk very little money upfront.<p>I would love to hear other opinions on Plivo, Tropo, or other competitors out there.",1395892730

A common misconception is that reds and greens are indistinguishable to people like me. That&#x27;s not really the case.<p>Most reds look red and most greens look green. It&#x27;s just that some particular shades of each are ambiguous. For me, the reds and greens produced by displays tend to be tougher to distinguish than natural hues, but the shades in the Stack Exchange question are as different as can be. It&#x27;s tough to explain. It&#x27;s also so subtle that many people with my particular type of colorblindness live and die without ever knowing the difference.<p>I only learned I was colorblind after being explicitly tested for it in 6th grade.

We did use lots of various modules, some core, and some community - such as polls, forums, captcha stuff, comments, we had almost a terabyte of stuff served via ImageCache...<p>We actually didn&#x27;t use Drupal forms for much on the front end (The occasional webform for user submissions, etc, but very few actual drupal api forms), but on the admin backend we had lots of little things I threw together that worked well but were not used all the frequently (and then only by power users).<p>Our frontend was primarily done through a system I called the Page module (Because it was the module that made...the pages - for instance <a href=""http://www.reflector.com/news"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reflector.com/news</a>). That was actually a really cool hack. It worked a lot like views - but could actually run on a high traffic site without bringing the whole thing to it&#x27;s knees. The trick was that the really nasty join across about 8 tables (node, the content type data, related image data, story body (for teasers), and a couple others) was done only on node save and that was stored in an index table (not everything on the node, but just what I needed to build a page). So to generate each news block was a really super simple query of basically:<p><pre><code>    select * from page_index where page_blockid = 12345 \n    order by updated desc limit 5\n\n    instead of something like, and this is the super simplfied version\n\n    select * from node left join content_type_story cts \n    on cts.nid = node.nid left join taxonomy_data td on\n    td.nid = node.nid left join uploads on uploads.nid = node.nid \n    left join upload_files uf on uf.uid = uploads.uid \n    left join node_content nc on nc.vid = node.vid \n    where (td.termid = 1231 or td.termid = 1256) and \n    node.published = 1 order by updated desc limit 5\n</code></pre>\n(Field names ommitted because that query is way too long as it is).<p>Of course, we were running multidomain so a lot of those tables where domain alises etc, again, all precomputed in my module.<p>No, I don&#x27;t miss it. But it was powerful, and I did develop, deploy, and serve 3 daily newspapers with 20k+ circ each with a dev and sysadmin staff of 1. There is no way I could have done that if I&#x27;d had to write everything from scratch.",1395891149

I&#x27;ve been in two startups that were working on things that aligned with my interests and things that I thought were pretty awesome. Then after the first year or two, due to the inability to acquire customers or the existing business model not working out, pivots happened, resources and people started getting moved into different teams and projects, and communication started breaking down between the execs, management, and engineers.<p>Then shit just hits the fan as people leave, sometimes taking others with them, as soon as they realise that things aren&#x27;t going as well as the company would want them to believe. After all, a company isn&#x27;t going to outright tell its employees that things are going to hell (until the very end at least). That&#x27;ll just cause a bigger exodus of talent. So it&#x27;s not uncommon in a failing startup that management starts BSing - it&#x27;s all about retaining employees.<p>In the end I think when you join a startup you have to be realistic about its chances of succeeding. Not every startup&#x27;s a rocketship. You&#x27;re going to get bullshit, pivots, short sighted decisions (or indecisions) when things aren&#x27;t going well.<p>My advice is to not be too emotionally attached to your job or go in with too high expectations. If you sense bullshit coming out from management, do some due diligence on the state of the company and leave if you must. After all, if you&#x27;re not happy doing what you&#x27;re doing, then it&#x27;s not worth it.

Whereas on KDE, it merely means drag and drop. It will even ask you, if you want to move or copy, that could come handy at times. Usually, I have a working folder open in split and a new tab if I want a full folder.<p>Secondly, KDE comes with a full suite of applications [1] that all follow same philosophy of user choice than minimalism. Gnome severely lacks that kind of application database. For example, there are not many applications, including big names like Banshee, that use Gnome&#x27;s message tray.

Drupal adds a layer of not much improvement as a trade for lots of extra work.<p>I think Drupal is a relic of the past when monolithic frameworks rather than the microframeworks ruled the day, I agree the same thing is happening in javascript world. The smaller/component/message based libraries win out after people know how to do things.  In the beginning monolithic helps people make the jump, but quickly become too all encompassing to the point it hides what you need to know (asp.net&#x27;s famous fail).<p>Who knows, drupal might have started off clean but when you are an overarching monolithic framework that becomes the go to for marketing/bizdev technology decisions then it bloats to EOL. You won&#x27;t find a happy developer in Drupal-land but you&#x27;ll find lots of marketing/bizdev peeps that think they are working out the need for a developer by using the standard bloated CMS of the day.  Angular is still on the developer front, but if it gets big enough and it is monolithic then it is a problem.<p>Drupal could be worse though, it could be Joomla, both flawed monolithic platforms from the PHPNuke evolution tree. That fad ended in 2007.",1395889239

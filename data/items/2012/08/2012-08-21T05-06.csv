Systems composed of heterogeneous components with robust and simple interfaces between them, are, I think, a good thing.

After reading your comment I decided that there had to be some respectable source who had advocated this earlier at some point and with some research I found this paper written by Rodney Brooks called Fast, Cheap and Out of Control : A robot invasion of the solar system outlining the same concept; <a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/fast-cheap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/fast-cheap.pdf</a><p>> I mean the attitude that comes across from your writing style.<p>Yes, I agree that my comments could look snarky under the weight of your assumptions, but I was doing my best to be genuine and engage in an honest discussion<p>> I have no idea what your qualificaitons are, how much thought you've put into this, how receptive you are to the idea that you're wrong<p>I'm actually quite certain that I'm wrong most of the times, but I don't know how I'm wrong and discussing, building things are the only ways to find out.<p>> whether or not you recognize that everyone has more ""unknown unkowns"" than anything else<p>Yes I do and it is a terrifying thought.<p>> or what your actual attitude is.<p>I'm doing my best to learn as much as I can and to never judge. (judgement takes up too many mental resources)<p>> And if you think you're the first person to think ""wouldn't it be great if not every spacecraft didn't have to have to re-solve the problem of power, communications, and computation?""<p>I'm not and I would love to do more than just think and actually build things.<p>> * Having an identical copy is not redundancy<p>Can you please explain why? Is it because the failure points remain the same?",1345526054

It's very old software though - I get the feeling that the restrictions were put there to avoid giving a registration advantage (for popular classes) to those who could afford then-new technology.

Most importantly, despite the obvious presence of ""celebrities,"" even completely unknown people can jump into the middle of a conversation on an important topic, and if they have their shit together, will be accorded pretty much instant respect and be treated as an equal.  There's very little sense of ""needing to pay one's dues.""<p>But you definitely have to have your shit together.  If you don't, you will be quickly eviscerated.<p>It's really rather nice, especially compared to many dev communities where there's often much more sense of entrenched factions.",1345525852

4411278,comment,4406820,4410114,1,0,randomdata,,,"> Evidently that wasn't very clear.<p>Actually, I would say your intent there was quite clear, which is where I came to realize that the code did nothing. Without that context, one could assume the method was used for its return value where the code could very well have had purpose as written.<p>What wasn't clear was how the <i>count</i> attribute was intended to be used throughout the rest of application. In the real world I would start to build a mental model around the uses of <i>count</i>, which was not available from your example. In terms of self-documenting code, I liken a short code snippet like your example to a sentence fragment in english. The entire sentence, or statement if you will, encompasses much more of the codebase.<p>This is definitely an fascinating topic, but unfortunately one that is very difficult to discuss for many reasons. I wonder how we can dig into the physiology aspects that you raise without the prevalent ""my way is the only true way"" attitude?",1345525680

If not these numbers are completely arbitrary and meaningless. It is equivalent to comparing, numerically, the price of one company in Pesos vs the price of another in Dollars, it would make no sense unless they are both converted into the same unit. In this case, we don't even have to go that far back: even Microsoft's market cap in 1999 (adjusted for inflation) was more.<p>Edit: link <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1079716"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1079716</a>",1345525495

Jeff touches on a few things I am pretty sure I would do differently.<p>I think the most important thing is working on visible projects and seeing them through to completion, as opposed to acquiring more depth through study.<p>Additionally, I would have went with Ruby instead of Python. Python jobs and internships seem to fall more within an area where people demand a CS degree background, at least in this region. With RoR the demand tilts heavily toward webdev, which doesn't require 4 years of CS to be productive.<p>I definitely still think it's possible for motivated and tech-savvy people to do what Jeff has done.",1345525219

6222560,comment,6220740,6222371,2,0,creamyhorror,,,"Cool ideas here. I imagine both Google and the military would be interested in building auditory feedback systems into their vehicles/control centers, if they aren&#x27;t already doing it.<p>What I think would be a useful addition would be transforming &#x27;levels&#x27; (as opposed to events) to ambient, continuously-playing audio. This is pretty much the &quot;dynamic audio&quot; of computer games.<p>For example, you could have strings playing according to CPU activity: softly and slowly (think double basses) when activity is low, but more loudly and urgently (cellos) when activity is high. That would create a sense of how busy the server is (if you enable the CPU activity &#x27;channel&#x27;).<p>edit: I see cortesi has already mentioned they&#x27;re working on transforming continuous data now - good job.",1376636327

Immigrants have one leg up over the competition: they have generally very little to lose and everything to gain. They have also already self-selected for being people that are not risk adverse (they just left everything behind to start a new life) and they are executing on their dreams.<p>I often see people that rant against immigrants in general and I always wonder how they would react if you explained to them that their old age pension likely depends on some not yet born immigrant and his or her children.",1376636218
6222550,comment,6222482,6222482,1,0,onion2k,,,"20 million people would pay $30/month for ESPN, raising the $600m it gets now, but instead people get it for just $6 because 100m pay. That means 80m people are paying $6 for something they don&#x27;t want. Those 20m who do want the channel are doing very well from the charity of the others. The problem though, is that those 80m aren&#x27;t happy. Eventually they&#x27;ll figure there are better things to spend their $6 on, so they&#x27;ll cancel their cable entirely <i>because they can&#x27;t just cut out the things they don&#x27;t want</i> and do other things with their money. Then <i>all</i> the channels suffer.<p>The point that the article fails to make is that the fees channels receive wouldn&#x27;t necessarily remain the same if people paid for channels individually. Some channels, ones with smaller audiences, would have to charge more to get the same revenue, or cut costs. Or close entirely. That&#x27;s fine. It doesn&#x27;t matter. Other things would replace them. That&#x27;s how markets work.",1376636205

Trying to hold it in is like expecting your sensitive tissues to behave the same as a scuba tank.<p>If you don&#x27;t hold it in, the air will simply leave your lungs and you have about 12-15 seconds before the remaining oxygen in your blood leaves your body making you unconscious. The lungs, instead of trading CO2 for O2 is now working in reverse in the vacuum, exchanging O2 for... nothing.

Its practically genetic, in the U.S., by now; the programming is so deep, and so much out of conscious awareness, that very few Americans can break free of it. Theyre really sleepwalking through life, living out a narrative that is not of their own making, while thinking they are in the drivers seat. Its also especially hard to break free of that mesmerization when everyone else is similarly hypnotized. Groupthink is enormously powerful. Even if it occurs to you to stop following the herd, it seems crazy or terrifying to attempt it. This is Sartres bad faith, the phenomenon whereby a human being adopts false values because of social pressure, and is thus living a charade, an inauthentic life. Its also what happens to Ivan Illych in the Tolstoy story, where Ivan is dying, and reviews his life during his last three days, and concludes that it was all a waste, because he lived only for social approval.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/how-americas-culture-of-hustling-is-dark-and-empty/278601/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/how-americ...</a>",1376635365

Most high performance server software (1) has precisely one process/thread per core and (2) takes complete control of its memory management. These behaviors have substantial performance benefits. A GC thread of any type will bleed performance, and that is ignoring the loss of performance from poor memory and cache efficiency that is inherent with GCs. High performance server code is one of those areas that highlights where GCs are inappropriate. I&#x27;ve written quite a few server engines in GC languages; you expect to see about half the performance of C/C++ as a rule of thumb.<p>Most modern server software performance is significantly bound by memory bandwidth and latency. Introducing inefficiencies in this area tends to result in material degradation of software throughput.

It&#x27;s insurance in general, and the arms race to try to get paid the same amount (adjusted for inflation) for the same procedure, over time.<p>So, suppose you get a really nasty cut that needs stitches, and you go to a clinic, and get that done. And suppose that the clinic adds up all the costs -- medical supplies, nurse time, doctor time, facilities (which includes everything from rent to keeping the lights on), time to process the bill through your insurance company, <i>everything</i>, and decide that $100 covers it, so they send a bill for $100 for &quot;suturing&quot; (the stitches to close up your cut). Your insurance company pays, everybody&#x27;s happy.<p>Fast forward a few years. Little bit of inflation has happened, so maybe now the clinic needs to make $102. But the insurance company has used the leverage of its network system to get the clinic to accept a lower rate -- they can threaten to stop sending patients to the clinic if the clinic won&#x27;t agree. And now the &quot;suturing&quot; billing code only pays $90.<p>So some clever person at the clinic comes up with an idea: instead of billing &quot;suturing&quot; for $102 and getting $90, they can bill for &quot;antiseptic gel&quot; at $20 and get paid $12, and bill for &quot;suturing&quot; at $100 and get paid $90, which means the clinic gets the $102, but now on a total bill of $120.<p>Fast forward a few more years. Now inflation has resulted in the clinic needing to make $105, but the insurance pays even less now. So now it&#x27;s billed as &quot;suturing&quot; at $100 (paying $80), plus &quot;antiseptic gel&quot; at $20 (paying $8), plus &quot;cotton swabs&quot; (to soak up the blood) at $30 (paying $17). The clinic gets the $105 to cover its costs, but now the initial bill comes in at $150.<p>It does not take a terribly long time for this arms race to turn treatment of a simple cut into a gigantic laundry list of services, materials, personnel and facilities, at a total initial bill that might run into the thousands of dollars, just to get, say, $110 out of the insurance company.<p>And that is basically what has been happening in the US. When you see one of those &quot;shocking&quot; hospital bills for something that seems simple, what you&#x27;re seeing is the result of the arms race between the medical billing arm of the hospital and the insurance company, which will have dozens or possibly hundreds of items on the bill, all at prices well above what the hospital expects to get, but calculated so that the eventual insurance payment will cover the actual cost.",1376633810

6222423,comment,6220049,6220348,3,0,asveikau,,,"> So, C. How do you translate the errors across function calls? are you, or are your functions just returning 0/1? (at which point, you&#x27;ve lost much of the richness of exceptions, I think)<p>If you think your options are only &quot;returning 0/1&quot;, you&#x27;re not being creative enough.<p>For example COM has a 32-bit integer called HRESULT that all methods return.  The high bit says something is an error.  A few bits in the high 16 bits indicate where an error is from.  The low 16-bits are private to whatever space is specified in the aforementioned bits.  So if you take an error like 0x80070002 you can say it&#x27;s an error, from the Win32 subsystem, and the error code is 0002 or file not found in this specific instance.  Another component can set the high bits differently and end up with their own 16-bit error codes.  I find when I write COM code the errors are much more meaningful than in a high-level language because it&#x27;s all very explicit, you&#x27;re constantly thinking about it at every function call, whereas in exception-based systems it&#x27;s all just very haphazard and hand-wavy.<p>Or you could look at something like glib.  Each method might have an out parameter which is a gerror object.  This includes an error code and a string.<p>In other words there are several conventions out there.  If you pick one and stick with it across a code base you can be very productive with a minimal amount of nonproductive &quot;philosophical questions&quot; like the ones in your post.  Even if you have several libraries which have different conventions, you can adapt <i>their</i> conventions to the conventions of <i>your</i> code base and it&#x27;s typically not a big deal.<p>> Instead of handling errors now at the source and handler, you&#x27;ll also need to handle them at every intermediate point (if (f()) { free things; return ???; }),<p>Actually this &quot;early return&quot; pattern is quite bad in plain C, because if you have N allocations for example, each &quot;return&quot; statement needs to free between 0 and N buffers before leaving the function.  That gets very maddening.  One way to avoid this is to have only one &quot;return&quot; statement at the end of your function and free any loose buffers if-and-only-if they are non-null.  This involves either constantly re-checking some error status, or using a goto to jump to the end of your function when something fails.  IMO the 2nd is much cleaner.  (Let that wrap around your high-level-language brain...  but also know that any large C only code base is doing the same thing if they are sane; grep the Linux kernel for &quot;goto&quot; and you might start to get a picture... and while you&#x27;re bashing C error handling and probably thinking ill for me for pulling out &quot;goto&quot;, please keep in mind your &quot;exception&quot; concept is really just a goto that crosses stack frames...)  In the end this pretty well simulates what you&#x27;d do in destructors in a C++ code base following the RAII pattern.<p>> and this burden makes exceptions wonderful.<p>In my experience it, on the contrary the exception concept just makes sure you have no idea that stuff can fail, and every small failure in a &quot;shockingly&quot; unexpected place blows up your entire program and terminates the process.  Or you have Java&#x27;s goofy &quot;checked exceptions&quot; concept and so lazy programmers will introduce do-nothing catch blocks to shut up the compiler.",1376633149

The system we have is just the result of the emergent behaviour of humans interacting, it&#x27;s more down to chance than design, even if some elements seem predictable.<p>We haven&#x27;t yet found a way to fairly spread privilege in our societies, so we&#x27;re stuck with the least worst system, but I would note that globalisation has actually raised living standards in many countries from India to China, in spite of, or perhaps because of its deleterious effects. People always want to hoard wealth (almost <i>everyone</i> does this, even those at the bottom), and it&#x27;s hard to change that. It remains to be seen whether we can effectively temper human desires and spread that wealth and not end up in dystopia, but please don&#x27;t try to blame things on a secret elite directing a carefully created system - it&#x27;s a mirage and is not helpful. There are many contending forces vying for prominence in our societies, and in many ways <i>corporations</i> are more powerful than people or politicians (NB a corporation is not a CEO, it is a composite body).<p>The guillotine you mention was actually far worse for the ordinary people of France than for the aristocracy (many of whom simply fled) - terror and denunciation was used as a weapon on moderate politicians and everyday citizens, and even eventually the chief proponent of its use.",1376632976

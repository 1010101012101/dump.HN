3136938,comment,3136475,3136774,10,0,AgentConundrum,,,"There are currently only five provinces/territories in Canada that mandate a minimum wage at or above $10/hour. Those are Ontario, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Newfoundland, and Nunavut. Even then, Manitoba and Nova Scotia only made it to that level on the first of <i>this month</i>. Nunavut is an anomaly in and of itself because <i>everything</i> is expensive as hell up there - it has a ridiculous cost of living from what I'm told - because it's remote and shipping supplies is costly.<p>Also, why do you think it's acceptable for people to only have one day a week away from work? Why is a nine hour workday acceptable? Are you taking into consideration that lower income workers are more likely to have to live further from work, and use public transportation to get to and from their place of employment (or to the grocery store, etc. but that's outside of my argument). So these people should have to work nine hours a day, plus any unpaid breaks they take. IIRC, my girlfriend is paid for breaks but not for lunch, so let's add a half an hour to this example to accommodate that. So we're at 9.5 hours per day, six days per week. Now, the worker has to walk to their bus stop - and to do it early so as not to possibly miss the bus - and maybe take a 15, or even 30, minute bus ride. They do that twice a day, to get to and from work. That's adding possibly an hour, or even <i>more</i>, to their day. So you're advocating that asking someone to spend nearly 11 hours a day, six days a week?<p>My first job out of college, doing some shitty COBOL programming, was 42.5 hours per week (40 working hours, plus an unpaid half hour a day for lunch). Because I was making enough cash to afford it, I lived within walking distance of work. It added maybe 15 minutes per day to walk to and from my job. I made between 38 and 43k for this, depending on when in my employment you asked me.<p>So why does it make so much sense for you to ask someone to spend an average of 66 hours a week of their time to make $28k, when I spent about 44 hours a week to make $43k?<p>I'm not even including the few weeks that I had to put in extra hours - no week ever really exceeding 60 hours from my recollection - at various crunch times, since I was paid out for that time, and the outlier in time was met by an outlier in pay. My hourly wage exceeded minimum wage by more than double, so including that would only skew the calculations further away from your argument.",1319144092

3136934,comment,3132752,3134460,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I can't speak for anyone but myself of course but living the 'don't be evil' motto would result in Google sometimes leaving money on the table if taking it would involve betraying some trust. When this comes up it is inevitably a privacy violation that people are concerned about, but sometimes its a bait-and-switch type situation like the new pricing for AppEngine.<p>I don't think anyone believes them to be a charity or a non-profit, but if you could show how a billion dollars in the quarter was not collected (reducing their free cash flow from 2.8B$ to 1.8B$ for the quarter) because to do so would have required sharing 'too much' information about their user's browing habits, or what they stored, how they used AppEngine. They would get tremendous kudos and support from the community and Wall Street would mercillessly pummel them. I mean really, who wouldn't pick a billion dollars up off the floor?<p>That sort of wall street punishment would depress their stock price, and that would hurt the employees who feel 'better' when their stock options are worth something than when they are worthless. It is a vicious circle.<p>Remember the discussion in City Slickers [1] when Bruno Kirby's character tries to get Billy Crystal's character to admit he would cheat on his wife if the situation was 'right.' (and by right he generally meant there were going to be no consequences, no one would find out, etc etc.) And at the end Billy Crystal says ""God would know."" That was a wonderfully crisp treatise on integrity, and it illustrated, the difference between externally applied values versus internally upheld values.<p>It seems few people in life have the level of integrity that Billy Crystal's character shows, and so the process seems to boil down to keeping enough consequences in place so that employees won't violate a company value, and having the will to fire people who step over the line, even if the company benefitted from their action.<p>'Don't be evil' is, as many have pointed out, really too squishy to be actionable. But something like 'if you have to choose profit over privacy, choose privacy.' would be. Certainly not as catchy though.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101587/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101587/</a>",1319144074

But I suspect that if we as a civilization were not capable of making a distinction between the hard sciences and the liberal arts, then Steve Jobs would have sought early medical treatment and would be alive today and for many years more.<p>Allow me to try and explain. The leading smart people used to be expected to know both the ""science"" of the day and the arts.<p>But then we get the age of reason and people start to specialize in one or the other, but rarely both. And we do end up with two separate and often defined against each other areas of knowledge.<p>Does this make sense? Just google image search for Millau Viaduct and tell me that product of engineering isn't also art.<p>I think the world has lost something by this split. I think engineering and science have lost a bit to. But I also suspect the liberal arts have lost a lot by not requiring a thorough knowledge of the hard science as a foundation.<p>Hell, I wish doctors were required to learn and know A LOT more math and statistics.<p>Somewhat ironically math is still considered an art at our universities.<p>But by not requiring a deep, and I mean deep knowledge of hard science for any liberal arts degree, our great institutions have created an artificial separation between learned people.<p>And there's also this distinct sense of mystique, an accidentally created legend about non-science ""knowledge"". This sense that the demon haunted world contains nuggets of powerful knowledge which would be evaporated if the light of the candle that is science would shine on them.<p>This mythical belief plagues society in surprising ways.<p>I think Steve Jobs decision to first try ""alternative medicine"" is party because of this.<p>And while every typical western (North America and Europe) university has ""core"" requirements, I think that's a joke. I think if instead everyone had to learn an almost equal share of hard science and liberal arts for any degree, then we'd have a better civilization.",1319142691

Maybe ""the rich"" can bear it, maybe not, but the point is effecting change of that sort would make them pay more, and that regardless of what actual tax rate we want to target, it would be better to start from a position where the actual tax paid by any individual is straightforward to calculate.<p>Only at that point does it become reasonable to figure out at exactly what number to set the tax rates, because until then you don't really know how much tax you're going to get from the person, since they may or may not have avenues of escape.",1319142210

Only developers will and they'll recognize that Dropbox only has rudimentary versioning capabilities [1]. There's zero risk of them confusing the two.<p>The ""version hell"" issue that David Pogue describes is something that most geeks solved long ago, but is far more common. There are millions of computer users who either don't have access to a file server, or their job requires them to collaborate on file sharing tasks with users that don't have access to the same file server they do. The work flow goes something like this:<p>* Allison creates a Word document with an agreement in it<p>* Bob and Mike need to review the document, so Allison emails it to the both of them<p>* Bob submits his revisions first, so Allison incorporates the changes, then emails the updated copy to both Bob and Mike<p>* Mike had previously saved the document from his email and had started his edits<p>* Mike submits the ""old version"" of the document with revisions, but many conflict with the changes that Bob submitted<p>* Allison is left with the task of sorting out the differences<p>For use cases like this, Dropbox is like ""OMG it's magic!"" to regular users. There's still the issue of editing conflicts (Dropbox doesn't support simultaneous editing), but this is much easier to work around than the game of ""telephone"" involved with emailing documents.<p>The moral of the story is that as geeks it's <i>really</i> easy to take our toolset for granted. ""Solved problems"" for us are a daily headache for your average person.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.dropbox.com/help/11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dropbox.com/help/11</a>",1319140801

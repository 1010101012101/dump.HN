Introducing that sometime in the future is going to be a bitter pill to swallow for a lot of users.</i><p>Throughout his whole essay he keeps asserting that advertising will drive users away but I don't think that's necessarily the case. I'm sure a lot of casual Internet users don't care about an ad here and there. And then there's always ways to filter the ads out (think Adblock).",1270892277

1254804,comment,1254100,1254100,0,0,quant18,,,"Yes, when you ask a committee of linguists to design an orthography for you --- you get a godawful almost-IPA ""one phoneme = one grapheme"" academic exercise which is utterly impractical for everyday use. (Again, an object lesson in the robustness of top-down-designed systems vs. ones which evolved from centuries of use). Azerbaijan would have had the same problem even if they had stayed with the Cyrillic alphabet. E.g. after Kazakhstan became independent, they had lots of trouble trying to use Kazakh as the administrative language due to a shortage of typewriters with the appropriate letters.<p>Uzbekistan is greatly underappreciated for having done something really neat after the Soviet breakup --- designing an orthography with no ""funny letters"". They use context to distinguish the ""back"" and ""front"" versions of phonemes like i [1]. And in the two cases where that would be too confusing (o and u), they put an apostrophe after the letter --- i.e. u', instead of something like ü.<p>[1] Turkey, which speaks a closely-related language, solved the ""front i"" vs ""back i"" problem by making one dotted and the other dotless --- those of us here probably know all of the toLowerCase-related bugs that caused, I think articles about this have been posted a couple of months ago",1270891797
1254803,comment,1254100,1254374,0,0,__david__,,,"I'm reminded of the English language and the ""thorn"" character (Þ). It used to be the character for the sound ""th"" but it fell out of favor and the final nail in its coffin happened when the printing press came into play--the typefaces were imported from Germany and Italy and they didn't have thorn. The printers substituted ""y"" for a while (hence ""Ye olde shoppe""--It's actually pronounced ""The"", not ""yee"").<p>So I would say it's not unheard of for an alphabet to be shaped by technology. We English speakers are not the worse for wear.",1270891714

That said, clearly if iPhones were a small part of the mobile ad platforms, nobody would care if Apple limited the ads that could be shown on them. I don't think that's the case though.<p>The point I was trying to make was: If we switched this around, and Microsoft had the number one smartphone, and they did something like this, regulators (though you're right, probably not American ones) would have them bent over a table.",1270891578

I aim to detect where it happens, and at least say ""hey, this flag is being ignored since it's going to break things"".<p>As for LZMA, it has a huge impact for sure, but until assembly merging and dead code analysis are in place, the impact on Silverlight assemblies is going to be pretty slim.<p>Dotpack does wonders on standalone binaries as it stands (compresses NVidia FX Composer to just over 20% of its original size, for instance), but most Silverlight assemblies only get a 10-20% decrease right now.

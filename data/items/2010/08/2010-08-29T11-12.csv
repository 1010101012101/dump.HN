1643659,comment,1641462,1643642,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"OK, to recap.  You want to decompose this:<p><pre><code>    [ 3x-1 ] / [ (x+2)(1-x+x^2) ]
</code></pre>
into fractions.  In other words, you want to find A and B such that:<p><pre><code>    A/(x+2) + B/(1-x+x^2) = [ 3x-1 ] / [ (x+2)(1-x+x^2) ]
</code></pre>
Apart from getting the brackets wrong, you said (correctly) that the left hand side is equal to this:<p><pre><code>    [ A(1-x+x^2) + B(x+2) ] / [ (x+2)(1-x+x^2) ]
</code></pre>
So now you need to solve:<p>[ A(1-x+x^2)+B(x+2) ] / [ (x+2)(1-x+x^2) ] = (3x-1) / [ (x+2)(1-x+x^2) ]<p>The denominators are equal, so you just need to make the numerators equal.<p>So tell me - what equation do you have to solve?",1283082533

There are plenty of examples in the vocabularies of various languages, one of my favorites is the word 'alarm':<p>I asked a lot of people in the Italy if they recognize what the word ""allarme"" comes from. Surprisingly only few recognized the exhortation ""all'armi!"" (to the weapons!) (<a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=alarm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=alarm</a>). Sometimes this effect creates a new word, but sometimes a concept remains indirectly expressed, while the speaker unconsciously extracts the high level meaning of it.<p>However, I noticed that most of the amateur discussions about linguistics scratch only the surface because mostly only nouns are touched.<p>For example when I was younger and still living in Croatia. A relative of mine was Macedonian and told me that they have a verb mood that is used when you state something which you are sure that is true, vs only being told that is true.<p>I'm not really sure what is that, after a bit of research I think it's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferential_mood"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferential_mood</a>.<p>""The inferential mood (abbreviated infer or infr) is used to report a nonwitnessed event without confirming it""<p>Does this shape the way you think?<p>After all, even English speakers are able to express the fact that they didn't witness an event; I guess they do, didn't check :-)",1283080974

1643624,comment,1642910,1643186,0,0,acabal,,,"I tend to agree with this.  When an entity takes new power, they fight tooth and nail to keep it, regardless of whether it's ""right"" for them to have it or not.  Bush II massively increased the power of the executive branch with terrorism and fear as an excuse, pushing it farther from a checks-and-balances system towards a checks-against-the-president system.  Now that it's been established that the executive has greater power, does anyone think any upcoming president will sit down and say, ""welp, time to give some of this up and bring it back to how things used to be!""  I don't think so.<p>Same with civil liberties taken by police and other enforcement.  The attitude <i>some</i> (not all, or even the majority of) officers seem to have is the attitude of control and being the boss, not serving and protecting.  (Like this article--on what imaginable grounds did the officer think he could arrest a citizen for taking film from within their own house if not because ""I don't like being on film, so I'm going to show this person who's boss by arresting them"").  When it becomes a case of maintaining some sort of imagined and idealized ""order"" instead of enforcing specific law, our liberties are eroded; and when we just lay back and take it, they probably aren't coming back, because those erosions then eventually <i>become</i> law as people and enforcers get used to the idea.<p>There are of course cases where things have been turned around for the better, like civil rights, suffrage, etc.  But this more modern trend of slow, steady, and insidious erosion of rights in the name of protecting us is that much more dangerous because we've become convinced we need the protection.<p>And when the enforcers have the big guns, the ability to detain or throw anyone in prison for almost anything, and a staggeringly complex body of law that requires a small fortune to defend against, things aren't so easy to change anymore.

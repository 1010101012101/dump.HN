What makes you think I gave a defensive or emotional answer to the intermediary who asked the question?<p>I'm perfectly aware of the fact that the person asking the question either considers this piece of data of paramount importance OR they have twenty resumes on their desk that all look the same, and they're looking for an easy way to winnow the pile down to three, so even if it isn't that important, it's a way to shorten the pile.<p>I personally doubt that they were looking at twenty nearly-identical resumes. My experience is that either of two situations hold: first, they might really believe this is the most important thing they need to know, or second, they might not be particularly skilled at identifying good candidates.<p>Note that I am not claiming I'm a good candidate: but if I'm not worth an interview, they should be able to tell without that question, the facts are in plain view.",1183661784
32641,comment,32553,32630,0,0,raganwald,,,"By your argument, we should abolish laws regulating workplace safety, product safety, and pollution control.<p>All of these things could be enforced by consumer demand, but they are not. All of these things impose a cost on business, driving up prices.<p>There is room for believing that the free market should be unfettered to the point that businesses can be left to choose what level of safety to provide for workers, left to choose whether  to make safe products, and left to choose whether to pollute our environment.<p>If you believe that, I think we differ at some axiomatic level, not a logical level.<p>I know that businesses are making ""rational"" decisions. But just because it ""maximizes their utility"" doesn't mean I want them to do it. Enron was rational. Why do we pass laws against its behaviour? Why can't we leave it to the marketplace to choose where to invest?<p>Again, this is a deep, axiomatic issue. If you are fundamentally against a regulated environment, I understand your view without agreement.",1183661031

32631,comment,32553,32553,0,0,spiralhead,,,"I think it is natural for engineers (hackers, especially) to deal with situations on an as-needed basis. We just solve problems. We make at least SOME effort to solve them in such a way where they won't continually come back and bite us in the ass but security catastrophes are like earthquakes. They're low frequency events and therefore inherently difficult to learn from and plan for. It's possible but time consuming, so the average lone hacker will not bother until he absolutely must. We know it's important. It's in the back of our mind at all times. But shipping product and getting users NOW will always take precedence over architecting for the future, methinks.<p>And that is just the unfortunate reality for now until (heaven forbid) there are some actual laws preventing it.",1183658626
32630,comment,32553,32589,0,0,willarson,,,"As per inserting words into your mouth, I addressed your argument, not you. Regarding my post as if it were a personal attack is a disservice.<p>
I don't follow your point about it being obvious that businesses will, left to themselves, put their customers in harm's way. Left to themselves businesses will do what maximizes profits. The behaviors that maximize profit are determined by the demand established by consumers. When consumers are unwilling to pay a premium for safety, then businesses will not provide safe products. Thus it is consumers, in their uninformed quest to maximize utility, that are hurting themselves.<p>
Consumers need better information so they can make better decisions, as it stands they are making a flawed choice (assuming that safety is indeed worth more than we currently pay for it). On the other hand, businesses are making the only rational decision available by continuing to produce unsafe products for customers who won't adequately compensate companies for safer products.<p>
Your certification mandates an additional cost on business,  one that customers are currently unwilling to pay for, and thus fulfills the role of taxation, which--if we are going to buy into the free economy myth--will result in lower overall utility: for both customers and businesses.",1183658484

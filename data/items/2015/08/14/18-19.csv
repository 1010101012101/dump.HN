10062094,comment,10060060,10061882,0,0,inthewoods,,,"The argument that HFTs would likely make is that they improve the efficiency of the marketplace, making for smaller spreads and for more liquidity, making it easier for all trades. The counter to both is that HFTs tend to disappear when market stress occurs, thus they fail to provide liquidity when the market needs it the most. I have no dog in the fight - HFTs do seem to have helped lower the cost of trading (along with the internet in general).<p>Whether or not we consider what the article describes as &quot;frontrunning&quot; - I&#x27;m not sure. Surely all these firms have bought access to the same Nasdaq direct feed, and have co-located their boxes as close to the Nasdaq servers as possible. I&#x27;m guessing the buy side and the sell side are both doing this at this point - either directly or through 3rd parties. My point is that yes, the advantage exists - but is probably getting reduced by the day. Is the retail trader going on SIP getting prayed upon? Probably, but retail traders also make up a small portion of total trades. That&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t a problem - but they aren&#x27;t the major market participants. Mutual funds are probably the biggest losers here - and they are, in turn, owned by individual investors. So there&#x27;s an argument there that they are hurting individual investors that way.<p>To me the real question the idea that these firms are essentially riskless. I&#x27;d agree that has been the case in the past - I&#x27;ve seen reports of HFT firms having something like 300+ winning days. But what happens when the entire market is made of competing bots - will the efficiency the competition essentially take away any advantage that any one player might have, thus making their profit disappear?",1439578739

What that means is that landowners are able to accumulate supra-natural returns in on their holdings, while doing nothing on their land.

HFTs add value by buying these large blocks, and then breaking them up and selling them in smaller chunks.  This is called &quot;market making.&quot;  This added liquidity makes it far easier for <i>both</i> the institutional investor to sell their shares as well as for the final buyer to purchase them.  So the value they provide is increased liquidity to the market.<p>Edit: Whoops, I&#x27;m incorrect.  This is a description of market making in general, but not how HFTs do it (which have a variety of strategies).  But the general premise is that the value provided is still increased liquidity.

Palo Alto is very strict about that - they even have an online form for reporting out-of-area students.[2] For poor people, there&#x27;s the crappy Ravenswood school district.  On the other hand, the trailer park is mostly retirees.<p>There are trailer parks all along the coastal area of the bay on the SF  peninsula, dating from when that area was used as trash dumps.  Google HQ is next to a former trash dump; Shoreline Park is a landfill, and in its early days had methane fires. Because no one wanted to develop that property, it came with a permanent tax exemption, which SGI exploited when they built there. Menlo Park had a dump too; that&#x27;s now a park.  Palo Alto recently closed the last section of their coastside dump and turning it into a park.

Apple, for instance, is building yet another campus in the valley. Couldn&#x27;t they build a facility some place else, spread the wealth a little, so to speak. There are lot&#x27;s of towns north of SF and south of Monterey that could use the influx of capital.<p>I am not saying we should force companies to move headquarters, I am just pointing out that Silicon Valley has huge, one might claim unreasonable, concentration of wealth. This concentration of wealth really shifts perceptions. For instance, 4 years ago or so I visited a friend in SF. We were to meet in a restaurant. An Uber car pulled out and he got out. I asked him about how it worked. His reply: &quot;It&#x27;s awesome, I order it on my phone, it picked me up and dropped me off here (~3 miles away) for ONLY $40! Isn&#x27;t that awesome!&quot; I am sorry, but for me at the time $40 was a lot of money, I would have walked the damn 3 miles for that money.<p>My point is, sometimes I think the entire Silicon Vally is in the bubble of affluence, and might be slightly delusional about what other people, outside the bubble, might think is or is not reasonable. The solution isn&#x27;t giving the poor people free money, the solution might be to grow (geographically) and spread the bubble around, making lot&#x27;s of people better off by reducing housing strain in the valley, and economically improving other communities throughout CA or even the grater USA.

10061914,comment,10060783,10061759,0,0,arjunnarayan,,,"To add to this, when you&#x27;re trying to minimize information flow among parties, you might have each player only send information to some other players (perhaps only the set that needs to know <i>right now</i> - think unit information from Player A to Player B. This is in the &#x27;fog of war&#x27; for player C, so you don&#x27;t send it. Later, however, the accumulated state needs to be sent to player C when it becomes relevant to her. I made this example up, but it&#x27;s quite common to minimize the amount of information sent over the network in latency-sensitive networked multiplayer games.)<p>The short answer is that accumulated calculations deviate in floating point arithmetic, because floats don&#x27;t behave like mathematical abstract numbers. One easy way to see this is that <i>operations on floats are not associative</i>, especially when you&#x27;re working on numbers that differ greatly in magnitude. So you don&#x27;t have the guarantee that (A * (B * C)) = ((A * B) * C). This can end up with state slowly deviating and it all falling apart.<p>The reason for this is fairly easy to see: floats are represented as A * 2^B (A is the &#x27;mantissa&#x27;, B is the &#x27;exponent&#x27;). In double-precision floating points, the mantissa is 52 bits, and the exponent has 11 bits (1 is left over for the sign bit). So if you have a really small number, say X = 1.125125123 * 2^-22, you can store it with a lot of precision. If you have a really large number, say Y = 1.236235423 * 2^30, you can also store this with a lot of precision. But now add the two together, and you&#x27;re basically going to throw out the smaller number entirely, because you don&#x27;t have enough mantissa bits. So essentially (X + Y) gives you Y. Now if you had a third number, say Z = 1.5 * 2^-22, and you were trying to do Y + X + Z, then order matters. Because (X+Z) together might &quot;bump&quot; it up to the point where they are within a multiplicative factor of (2^52) of Y, so they have some impact on the total. But Y + X throws out X, and then (Y + X) + Z throws out Z. So (Y + X) + Z ≠ Y + (X + Z)<p>P.S. I didn&#x27;t check the math but that&#x27;s the basic argument. I could be off by one or two orders of magnitude, but the point stands that floats behave wackily if you care about correctness.",1439577107

Saying that &quot;insert&quot; has log(n) complexity is misleading when you realize the branching factor is 32. Likewise, &quot;compare&quot; has log(n) or mostly constant complexity in most real-life settings where you&#x27;re comparing against a value that was calculated from the one you&#x27;re comparing against (so shares lots of subtrees by reference). You&#x27;re not e.g. sending back a fresh new copy of the data from the server to compare against. Immutable-js _could_ put &quot;it&#x27;s linear theoretically but most of the time it&#x27;s really almost constant time&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t help much either.<p>Is it blasphemous to say that looking at runtime complexity is gradually becoming more of a premature optimization (thanks to better hardware)? You can argue all day long that your js object has constant insertion time, but the underlying implementation makes it an order of magnitude slower than array for a limited number of fields. And if you accidentally trigger the hidden class deopt that turns it into a hash map that&#x27;s another order of magnitude slower. No amount of ordinary complexity analysis will help you here. Vice-versa, when Babel gradually starts supporting constant lifting for collections (somehow), you can look at a piece of code in your editor, reason that a comparison is linear, but then have the transpiler lift it out (`const liftedA = []; function foo() {return liftedA;}` instead of `function foo() {return [];}`) and not realizing yourself that the comparison is actually constant time (reference comparison). And then, if you write some overly clever optimization for that piece of code yourself, you might ironically get worse perf because the transpiler can&#x27;t lift the collection anymore.<p>That being said, Immutable-js uses the same concept and clojure&#x27;s persistent data structures (exposed as mori for JS users). Here&#x27;s a nice article on it: <a href=""http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-...</a>",1439575793

We do use a fair bit of water, it works out to ~35 gallons a day. Google claims that an average family in US uses 300 gallons, just looked it up. So I guess we aren&#x27;t doing too bad.<p>All of our water features are low flow, of course. There are a few improvements which could really improve water usage. Our 2 biggest uses are showers and the toilet. If we could collect the shower water, and use it as gray water to flash with, it could be a good saving. We also wouldn&#x27;t really need to go to a composting toilet. For instance, our RV toilet uses tiny amount of water to flash with, and it works just fine. Unfortunately, the way this house was designed, it makes it very difficult (basically impossible) to make plumbing changes. The entire house sits on a \nconcrete slab, and all of the plumbing pipes are cemented in. The best way to go is to start collecting rain water, which just requires a big (2000 gallon or so) tank. We would need to place it below the house level, in the canyon to the right of the house. It&#x27;s something we investigated, and intend to do as soon as we have the budget for it.<p>Drilling a well would be an option, and I didn&#x27;t want to give an impression that we are not doing it simply because of the money. The other issue is that all of our neighbors wells are drying out at the moment, and it&#x27;s not clear what&#x27;s going to happen to them in a year.<p>As for the heating and cooling, this house is really good in that regard. The walls are very thick, and very insulated. They are at least 80% thicker than what I used to have in San Diego. The house maintains heat very well. In the summer time we use a swamp cooler (another water using device). We do not have an air conditioner. The swamp cooler does the trick by blowing outside air through a water impregnated paper membrane. It&#x27;s basically a huge humidifier. Electrically it&#x27;s very efficient, only using around 150-200 watts. It can bring the temperature down by 15° - 20° F. We also have fans all over the place. The roof top solar panels also add to the cooling of the house by blocking some of the direct sunlight.<p>The house has lot&#x27;s of windows, with wooden shutters to block out the sun. All of the windows are double panel, insulated, with aluminum frames, so there isn&#x27;t much heat leaking out there. The doors do need upgrading however, and that&#x27;s what we are doing now.<p>I really love some of the ideas that I have seen when googling &quot;earth-ship.&quot; Thanks for the reference! In any way, it&#x27;s an experiment in progress, we are about 1 year into it. If we were designing this house from scratch, we would have made different design decisions. Such as gray water system, 12V DC as a secondary electrical system around the house, a rain water collection system, permanently installed backup propane generator, a green house, etc. For now we will work with what we have, and slowly upgrade some of these things, as possible.",1439575417

So ideally an entity wouldn't be punished for requesting a takedown of their own content but because of the insane volume of bogus takedown requests I think it's better to punish those who send them and if anyone accidentally sends a takedown request for themselves then them's the breaks until the system can differentiate between legit, bogus, and self takedown requests.<p>Furthermore, I'm not sure how YC deleting a post and issuing a DMCA takedown request against content on their own site are the same thing. This isn't about deleting content at all. Whether a site deletes content isn't at issue whether it violates copyright or not. The issue is sending bogus takedown requests to others.",1347220756

4496778,comment,4495663,4495663,11,0,kens,,,"Epigenetics is a very interesting area, and I expect it to increase in importance following the ENCODE project that just came out.<p>The NYTimes article is a bit strange, though, trying to politicize epigenetics through the ""mommy wars"". The article also muddles the difference between genetic issues due to aging fathers and epigenetic issues. The recent Icelandic study links mutations in sperm from aging fathers to autism and schizophrenia, which is genetic (the mutations show up in genome sequencing), so it's basically irrelevant to the article's epigenetic thesis. The NYTimes article mentions a theory that maybe epigenetic regulation is reducing DNA repair and causing mutations, but that's a pretty tenuous connection.<p>It's silly to turn this into a ""blame game"", but it is interesting that males and females contribute different types of genetic errors: females typically introduce chromosome errors, while males introduce DNA mutations. 20% of human eggs have the wrong number of chromosomes, compared with 3-4% of sperm. A cell has to split the chromosomes twice in meiosis to form a gamete, which is a difficult process where a lot can go wrong. Eggs sit around potentially for decades and then need to twice split properly, and this becomes much more error-prone with age. The first split happens at ovulation, and the second at fertilization (which is much later than I'd expect). These errors in chromosome separation are the leading cause of miscarriage and mental retardation. On the other hand, males are the main source of DNA mutations, since sperm are constantly being created, and each round of DNA replication has a chance to introduce errors. [Reference: Molecular Biology of the Cell, chapter 21, which is an interesting book]<p>Last week I read the book ""The Epigenetics Revolution"", which I recommend as it gives a good description of epigenetics. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Epigenetics-Revolution-Understanding-Inheritance/dp/0231161166"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Epigenetics-Revolution-Understandi...</a> (non-affiliate link)",1347220640

If I ""misidentify"" some work as my own, I have not.  Yes, there's a separate requirement of good faith, but that's not at all like perjury.<p>Personally, I think the penalty for bad faith DMCA notices should be that one loses the copyright claimed to be infringed, but the law contains no such provision.

4496760,comment,4496255,4496255,0,0,programminggeek,,,"I think Amazon is taking the right approach. I love the Amazon Doctorine: Above all else, align with customers. Win when they win. Win <i>only</i> when they win.<p>This approach will serve Amazon well if they follow through.<p>Apple's approach of making the best products in the world and selling them at a profit works for Apple, but to carve out a niche, Amazon has taken their own way.<p>Interesting, with the Nexus 7, Google admitted basically that they are willing to follow Amazon's lead and try and be more of a content/commerce oriented device, but Amazon already got there and it does it better with the Kindle Fire than Google does with the Nexus 7 and the Play store.<p>Google trying to follow Amazon's lead seems like a mistake. Google has never really been a media/content or even a commerce company. They are an advertising and technology company. Google doesn't love selling things, they love giving things away for free and wrapping them in ads. Google isn't good at getting people to pay for things yet. I'm not sure that Google wants to be good at selling things.<p>Google should play to their strengths and make a 7"" Motorola tablet that is advertising subsidized and sells for $100. Just matching price with the previous Kindle Fire is not going to get them success in the tablet market.<p>So, Apple is built around selling high end devices that delight customers. Amazon is about getting you to purchase stuff from Amazon.com and is building an ecosystem of devices and software to make that the best experience in the world. Google is built around repackaging 3rd party content and wrapping it in advertising. Microsoft is built around selling  entertainment and productivity software and services.<p>All of these companies have a different approach that will take them different places. I don't know that any of them executing their strategy will be a huge detriment of the success of the others.",1347220380

I think it depends partly on whether you're really writing an app, or hacking together an MVP.<p>The reason I feel this way is that most apps have a great deal of simple CRUD (SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE id=? and UPDATE [table] SET [...] WHERE id=?), which is exactly the problem ORMs optimize for. Any skilled engineer is going to notice they're writing the same boilerplate SQL -> data structure of some kind (maybe it's a dictionary type structure) code over and over again and write a framework around that. Congratulations, you now have an ORM, except that it's one hacked together by a busy engineer, far less tested, and missing features that would save you writing a lot of boilerplate code.<p>Meanwhile, your engineer realizes that one should separate view logic from business logic, and maybe have some glue in between, so you've got a request-handling layer, a view (+view model?) layer, and something that handles business logic and database access (or maybe those two things are separate, depending on your engineer.) Congratulations, you now have an MVC stack! Except again it's one that's far less tested, has no documentation, and has been hacked together by your engineer, who I should mention is very busy trying to write all this boilerplate code.<p>So now you've got all that taken care of, it's time to allow people to login. Your engineer is now spending their time writing an authentication system. Your engineer is certainly skilled, but there are a lot of nuances to get right with this sort of thing, so your authentication system has a lot of little security flaws and subtle bugs that you will spend the next several months fixing.<p>You see where this is going...",1347220125

Looks like there needs to be a specific exception for sending an image of oneself, or receiving an image directly from the subject of the image, or, in the case of an image with multiple subjects, sharing the image with the other subject(s).<p>I like this, actually.  It would clarify that there is a huge difference between sending a photo of oneself to one's lover, and sending a photo of a victim to a fellow child pornographer.  Also, I like that a photo with more than one person in it could not be shared with anyone who was not in the photo.<p>I recall a case where a girl sexted her boyfriend, and the boyfriend's kid brother found the images and circulated them on the Net.  In this case the kid brother is the one who would wind up in trouble, and I think that's the right outcome.  (I'm not saying he should be on the sex offender registry, but he did commit a serious crime and needs to be made aware of that.)<p>As for your proposal -- I think that was the status quo before any of these possession laws were passed.  I think it was felt that that structure did not give law enforcement sufficient leverage.  Criminalizing possession allows prosecutors to pressure consumers of child porn into naming their suppliers, so that investigations can find the people actually making the stuff.  It also attempts to stem the flow of money to these people.  I have considerable sympathy with these purposes; but I also agree with Falkvinge that criminalizing mere possession is intolerable on free speech grounds.<p>So I'm trying to find a solution that gives law enforcement at least some of the help they want (and that many people agree they should have) while not criminalizing mere possession.",1347220038

For example, if human oversight was required before the content was removed, that wouldn't necessarily restrict companies' ability to remove content, but it would minimize bogus takedowns by bots.<p>Again, I'm not really staking a position here, I'm just trying to start the conversation while I figure out my own views on the subject.",1347219844

4496723,comment,4494666,4496399,1,0,ryanmolden,,,"I wouldn't necessarily consider you 'real dreams' out of reach. I mean they may be more difficult now, but not impossible. Clayton Christensen, who is a world renowned professor at Harvard, says 'I had been out of college and in the working world for years before I figured out that I could make it back to school to teach and develop a generation of wonderful young people'[1]. Now, most of us aren't Clayton Christensen level of awesome, but I think the general point stands. You CAN make drastic changes in your life, even if you have gone off 'into the weeds'.<p>As for CV fears, in my experience, in the tech industry (assuming this is the target industry, I don't know much about others), your CV/pedigree is less important compared to what you know / can do. Demonstrating the latter can be harder without having the former as leverage to 'get your foot in the door', but having public depots of things you have worked on (ala GitHub), helping out on OSS projects, networking with people in the area via meetups/tech talks/etc... are all good ways to 'get your name out' so you can rely less on credentials to get opportunity. I can definitely relate to the being a loner thing, I am myself. I have had a number of friends/family pass away and it has made me very hesitant to make close friends because losing people that are close to you sucks. Participating in online forums/mailing lists in order to learn and help others can be a good way to get some 'socializing' without having to actually socialize :) Then the next step would be dreaded socializing IRL, but that is less scary once you have established some kind of reputation, even if it is just 'that guy that answers questions on technology X on (mailing lists/StackOverflow/Other)'. Don't spend too much time worrying about other people or if they view you as a failure or whatnot. People that make those kind of sweeping judgments on others are, more often than not, worthless people to know/interact with.<p>If your concerns are interviewing just realize it is a skill like any other. No one is really 'born good' at it. I think people that think they are either have interviewed only a few times and happened to get questions they already knew or areas they were very familiar with, have interviewed a lot and thus have a lot of practice, or they are just trying to appear awesome by acting like interviews are just a cakewalk for them. Most people get nervous at interviews, especially since you are basically competing for a job, which can be stress inducing. I don't know if there are tricks to getting better other than reading some of the better books on interview prep and practicing. I know some schools have mock interviews you can participate in (possibly only for alumni/current students) to get practice so you are less nervous. One other thing to keep in mind is most of the time the interview is not to see if you know the correct answer, or even if you can come up with it under a time/pressure deadline. Rather it is to see how you approach a problem, what kinds of questions you ask, how well you can verbalize your approach. Most interviewers will try and steer you towards the right answer if you are asking questions or 'throwing ideas out there', unless they suck at interviewing, in which case they just sit there mute while you wander around the answer space. Sucky interviewers suck, but you will likely encounter a few.<p>20120910 gives good advice, and he is honest that you may encounter a lot of depressing events (rejections, failures, etc..), but everyone does (okay, most everyone, some are born silver spoon firmly affixed in mouth). The important thing is learning from them, relentlessly improving and continuing on. Not to sound too 'self-helpy', but really the only one that can hold you back is yourself. There are lots of oppurtunities out there, finding them can be a challenge, but the reward is great. It is also a great feeling to know that you have done it yourself and things weren't handed to you. I watched an interview with Chris Sacca the other day[2] and he had a hilarious bit where he was talking about the entitlement of some of the straight out of college hires at Google who had never had much adversity in their life, how they were honestly getting pissed off because the cafeteria ran out of pheasant one day (obviously an exaggeration, but I have met people that would view that as a <i>major</i> problem in their life). Just know, you aren't the guy complaining about lack of pheasant :)<p>[1] How Will You Measure Your Life - Clayton Christensen (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Will-Measure-Your-Life/dp/0062102419/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347217293&sr=8-1&keywords=how+will+you+measure+your+life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Will-Measure-Your-Life/dp/00621024...</a>)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6NpHbMFaQ8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6NpHbMFaQ8</a>",1347219817

It is actually moving the superposition itself from one place to another.

That said, it probably is impossible to understand the reasons for its existence or the need to check out a neighborhood like this without growing up in a culture like that.",1347217301

This HN thread persuaded me to find them in the blog archives.

The comics significantly outperformed the text articles in terms of engaged readers, though I didn't run the whole thing long enough to be of any practical help.<p>My partner and I are releasing an iPhone game soon, and we're planning to repeat this experiment but with somewhat longer-form comics. The idea is to communicate the human story behind the making of the app. If anyone is interested, my email is in my profile.",1347217243

I'm glad you're getting stuff done at night; I've been stuck on the same moderately complex C++ state machine implementation since she was born. I'm just too tired to load the problem into my head.<p>While my wife is theoretically capable of doing everything on her own we share duties like you do, if only because there's no way I could allow the woman I married to suffer the entire burden of childcare unsupported. I don't know of anyone who does things any differently.<p>> I've gotten pretty good at one-handed typing<p>In another context that would be a source of shame, not pride :)<p>In bearmf's defence, we do matter more <i>to the child</i> after 2 years old. What we're doing now is supporting the mother.",1347217232

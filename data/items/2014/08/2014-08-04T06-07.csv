I&#x27;m not saying its an easy task, but there is an economic incentive attached to that today.<p>Garbage pickup in any Indian Metro today is contracted and billed at a reasonable price. There is also a huge incentive to collect stuff plastic, or broken stuff and sell it to recyclers. If I&#x27;m not wrong picking up industrial waste for a price is one of the most profitable businesses of the day. As far as I know &#x27;Gujri&#x27;[Dump yards] millionaires exist in a city like Bangalore.<p>But its nothing like what the poor souls suffered in the past.

Being denied the right to share the same space with other &#x27;higher castes&#x27;, not allowed to study, or even at times denied to walk on the same roads as higher castes did, or untouchability. Compare this to the situation today, where in a city like Bangalore the contractors just refuse to pick up the garbage when they are not paid, and your roads will just overflow with filth.

8130642,comment,8127012,8130271,1,0,crdoconnor,,,">Whether they claim credit or not is not something I care much about, since the wellbeing of political careers is not my problem.<p>The question is not whether you support the wellbeing of others&#x27; political careers, it is whether you support the efforts to squash all opposition to the hegemony via legal means or otherwise.<p>I am frankly not comfortable with the PAP holding so much power, this is why I consider it my problem. The more they manage to destroy the opposition with tactics like these the more they can operate with impunity. Impunity means they don&#x27;t HAVE to listen to the opposition at all - something apparently you like.<p>>having read quite a bit by LKY, I consider policies like minimum wage to be ideologically against what PAP stands for (or what Singapore has become).<p>It&#x27;s not especially. I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised to see them implement it at some point if the cries become loud enough.<p>If you truly have read a lot of LKY then you should know that he puts pragmatism above all else.<p>>Minimum wage is a rights infringement, in that it impedes consenting individuals from forming contracts at terms deemed &quot;illegal&quot;.<p>Libertarianism (20th/21st century) is kind of stupid and every privileged young white guy should probably grow out of it by their mid 20s. The unethical AXIOMATIC heart of its ideology is that &quot;strong property rights&quot; matter more than poverty. It&#x27;s a corrupt justification for the abuse of the rich and powerful in other words.<p>>It&#x27;s been catastrophic in most countries it has been tried<p>I don&#x27;t know if this could be a more absurd statement. It&#x27;s only &#x27;catastrophic&#x27; for profit margins of companies that take advantage of people teetering on the edge of poverty. The economic incidence falls almost entirely on them (even the effect on inflation is very tempered, and unemployment almost never goes up).<p>>For example, I remember Milton Friedman<p>An absolute joke of an economist, who thought that you could control employment and inflation through interest rates (proven utterly and totally 100% wrong sine 2008).<p>>commenting on how minimum wage had artificially restricted the number of fast food jobs available to unskilled teenagers, causing whites to be disproportionately hired over blacks, causing higher black unemployment amongst the working class.<p>I&#x27;m always kind of wary about when rich, privileged white guys tell the unprivileged underclasses what&#x27;s good for them. Especially when the empirical evidence for their claims is light.<p>There&#x27;s been plenty of empirical research that demonstrates the effect on job losses is negligible and a lot of hot air by apologist for the corporate/oligarch classes&#x27; whose profit margins depend upon a low/non-existent minimum wage still claiming that it&#x27;s all wrong. Lies.<p>>Minimum wage policy is being continuously introduced and voted down with over 70% of the popular vote in Switzerland<p>The minimum wage introduced that got voted down would have been THE highest in the world.<p>>where a waitress at a cafe can easily make 6k CHF/month thanks to market forces.<p>Or because of the same trade unions that actually got the vote for the $25 minimum wage introduced in the first place.<p>>The issue of course is that PAP can&#x27;t outright say that its policy is often inspired by the Founding Fathers<p>They draw inspiration from all over the place, but the only real ideology they have is pragmatism. They hardly paid much attention to the 1st, 2nd or 4th amendments to the constitution did they?<p>>I find it hard to reconcile the criticism of the government as being corrupt, with the utter lack of actual evidence of, say, government contracts landing in the Lee family&#x27;s pockets<p>Why would he do that when he can just pay himself the highest prime ministerial salary in the world?<p>What evidence there is (I believe there are bits and pieces, but from relatively unreliable sources) gets squashed more often than elsewhere because there&#x27;s no free media and if you breathe a word of it without cast iron proof you will generally be sued into bankruptcy. Who is therefore going to dig for impropriety? Nobody.<p>So, even if he WERE corrupt as hell, I doubt we&#x27;d hear about it. The stranglehold on information is too tight.<p>LKY&#x27;s son is prime minister now, too. If that doesn&#x27;t scream nepotism, I don&#x27;t know what does.<p>>(if anything, Temasek seems to acquire companies AFTER they become successful, which is what you&#x27;d want them to do as a &quot;shareholder&quot;),<p>Yeah, but pay attention to who they put on the board and what salaries they are paid.<p>>(and reading the Wikipedia article, again on my home connection, completely unimpeded by government censorship, I see that he did raise $110,000 in legal fund aid to carry the case to completion).<p>Gosh, you don&#x27;t live in China. How wonderful.<p>Yes, he raised $100k. Not enough to prove high level corruption. Not even close. Know how much a good forensic accountant is worth? Know how much of their time you&#x27;d need? I&#x27;d estimate probably at least 2 good ones for one or two years for a case like this to have a shot at making a good case. I&#x27;d expect bureaucratic stonewalling even then.<p>>Court digs, finds allegations to be untrue<p>Court DIGS? I really don&#x27;t think so. Court does what court is ordered if court knows what&#x27;s best for it.<p>>How do you pick a side?<p>I haven&#x27;t picked a side. You can&#x27;t pick a side on this case. It&#x27;s like like being asked to pick a side in a murder case in the middle ages where all of the evidence is hearsay. Any third party who claims to know which side is lying and which side isn&#x27;t is lying themselves.<p>I SUSPECT that this allegation might be false simply because it&#x27;s an allegation where the PM decided to use the nuclear option. It&#x27;s a good tactic to scare anybody else with evidence into shutting up if occasionally you pick off somebody who <i>did</i> make an unprovable false accusation. I don&#x27;t really know though. Even if he didn&#x27;t, the chances of the case going his way are nil.<p>I&#x27;m saying that if the court case is to be at all meaningful then the defence fund needs to be charged up to at least $4-5 million dollars before we can be convinced that the trial was fair, because PROVING financial impropriety at that level (which is what he is being asked to do) IS ACTUALLY that expensive.<p>If they don&#x27;t do that (and they won&#x27;t) then it&#x27;s a sham trial. End. of. story.<p>>Where is the evidence? Where are the hard facts? That&#x27;s all I ask for.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: you&#x27;re NOT asking for that. You&#x27;re offering up a weak apology for the ruling party who intentionally created a rigged court case.<p>The US does this too, of course. Plenty of people are charged with a crime and have their assets confiscated, meaning that they can&#x27;t put up a meaningful legal defense. It&#x27;s one of many ways the state abuses its power.",1407134585

The article is distracting from the real problem and now you are contributing to that.<p>The problem is that there is no plumbing and sewage in many areas and no resources to build it.  There is no running water. The budget that the local government has is say 100 units.  Installing a sewage system costs 1000 units.  Installing running water for the whole village costs 3000 units.  Its just not going to happen.<p>The problem is that resources are not being allocated fairly.  One of the main things that sustains that lack of equality is racism.  Racism is a huge problem, even here in this thread.  It is often disguised as a disparagement for &quot;lack of education&quot; or &quot;cultural issues&quot; or &quot;population&quot;.<p>These are not toilets like we think of toilets.

Actually its buried in the ground.  Someone is going to have to lean in and scrape the feces out.<p>Or, since there is 4 acre open field about 1/8 of a mile away which is often downwind, people who can walk should go take their shit over there, rather than leaving it in the house, where we will have to smell it all the time.",1407134309

However, this claim is always getting exaggerated in news reports; it&#x27;s as if every stolen item gets shipped overseas because there&#x27;s much more money to be made.<p>A variation I heard purports to explain what happens to all those stolen bicycles: the crooks ship containers full of stolen bicycles overseas where they can be sold for triple the price. If it were so much profit to be made, a legitimate business could simply <i>buy</i> the merchandise and export to these countries legally.<p>Also, in some cases, it would be very difficult to exploit the price difference whether the goods were exported legally or illegally. For example, in Singapore cars are massively more expensive than in the U.S. The government auctions off the right to put cars on the road each year.

STL containers are usually parameterized not only over the key and value, but over the comparator and allocator.  Nest a couple of them and you suddenly have a type with several dozen variables.  GCC expands the whole type out, without typedefs, when printing error messages, which means that you will sometimes get compile errors that are 10 pages long.  Clang fixes this by preserving the typedefs, without which you wouldn&#x27;t want to write such a type.

However, when the practice of relieving oneself in an area designated for that purpose outside the village for public in general, there was no one cleaning it up, it was left to nature. Ironicaly, The job of toilet cleaning started to exist only when the toilets moved closer and closer to home.<p>No, we still do not clean up after us and even today whether we like it or not there are still people in all countries throughout the world who are engaged in the waste disposal industry. Guys who collect garbage at your home every morning, still don&#x27;t really enjoy it whether they come walking, on tri-cycle or in a ultra modern garbage truck and it is the practice in the best of societies today. Collecting decomposing organic waste of any nature is bad experience for anyone.",1407132428

I write software every day, and Eclipse ended allowing me to have the <i>highest</i> productivity of all tools I surveyed in the blog post. I wanted to write a simple robot automation library, and I was struggling at every step with other tools, but with Eclipse I was able to get going very quickly and build, refactor, test my code rapidly.  This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for, this is what native Arduino IDE did not provide, and so I wrote a post about it :) Pure and simple.",1407132290

8130557,comment,8127491,8130411,1,0,dyarosla,,,"I can see the merit in having something that snag&#x27;s kids&#x27; attention. When anyone is intrinsically motivated to understand something, that is the moment when they&#x27;ll truly look to understand rules and really start learning.<p>I would have to say that the physical devices thing is perhaps your own projection for being the best way of snagging kids&#x27; attention- of course, you do work with robotics and quadcoptors, but for many kids, real games (and that means not Scratch or Logo) are what catches attention.<p>LightBot&#x27;s design starts basic. But the puzzles become quite difficult. From what I&#x27;ve seen, kids associate with the character and first become interested due to that connection, and then are later motivated to complete puzzles because each completion actually feels rewarding and something that they truly had to figure out (very few things do that nowadays outside of puzzle games for kids).<p>So perhaps physical toys are your cup of tea, and they may be for many kids, but just think about how many kids today would rather play Minecraft than play Lego Mindstorms. It&#x27;s not a physical contraption and can be seen as an educational tool in many regards. I would argue that physical toys aren&#x27;t always the best motivators for kids in the same way that video games aren&#x27;t for others.",1407132241

Of course the type that these systems infer for the program is correct, and the author does demonstrate an understanding of that. But that a small input to a system can produce a large output should be little surprise to any person that works with complex systems, especially computer systems.<p>The underlying mechanism that leads to the computational complexity in HM(x) systems--the process of generalizing types to schemas and instantiating schemas to types in order to support let-polymorphism--would make for an interesting discussion, but the author hasn&#x27;t hit on that yet. Unfortunately, the only people that really understand that part of the algorithm are the people that have implemented the algorithm, and there aren&#x27;t many of those people around. Strange but true. The algorithm that&#x27;s taught and implemented in most undergraduate PL courses (PL:AI-based courses included) does not support let-polymorphism. If the author&#x27;s reading, upgrade to ATTAPL[0] and start implementing.<p>Also, to answer the question &quot;How to compile Turing machines to ML types&quot;, have a look at typo[1] for one way to do it in Haskell (by reducing it to lambda calculus (shameless plug)).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/attapl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/attapl/</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/seliopou/typo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/seliopou/typo</a>",1407132038

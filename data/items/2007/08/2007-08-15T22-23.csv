This is reasonable, because we were the type of founder we like to invest in.<p>It may sound presumptuous to use yourself as a proxy for the audience, but this is how a lot of good things came about: the Porsche 356, the Apple II, Google.",1187218434

42826,comment,42702,42819,0,0,pg,,,"No, users do have a right to complain.  Any site purporting to offer a service ought to try to make users happy.  And this site isn't just a personal project.  It's part of YC.  So I ought to be able to claim that this change will benefit the people our site is for. And I do think that. YC specifically targets more hackerly founders, and I think they want to read about more than just startups.",1187218028

At the very least I'll set up a basic spam filter, but I'm unsure if I should train it myself beforehand (by copy and pasting the 1000 Gmail spam emails I have in my inbox) or wait until site launch.<p>People will write text that other people see, so it's probable that some of it will be spam.<p>What do you all do?  Is there a big database of spam to preconfigure spam filters?",1187217089

Who are you to call anything associated with this site a ""disservice""?  That is patently absurd.<p>If you are not happy with this site anymore, you are free to go start your own.  You should not be free, however, to sit idly by and condemn the decisions of those who are aiming to make progress.",1187216068

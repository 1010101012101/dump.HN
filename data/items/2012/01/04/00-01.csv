3422119,comment,3421882,3421957,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"The whole point here is that it's <i>not</i> really an antique piece. If I sell you a 'drawing by Picasso' for $10k, but when you examine it you see that's it's on a kind of paper that was manufactured after Picasso's death, then naturally you will want your money back. Now, the broker (eBay/Paypal) could simply require you to send it back to me and that I refund the money, but that likely means I will just sell it again and again until I find some sufficiently gullible buyer - putting all the risk onto the broker and damaging its reputation.<p>Now, we could argue about whether a drawing by some modern artist that looks very like the work of Picasso is really any less valuable in <i>aesthetic</i> terms, and this question has cropped up a few times in the art world - see Orson Welles' little-known masterpiece <i>F for Fake</i> for a documentary treatment of the subject. But the fact is that the buyer is not satisfied, and whether the buyer has poor taste or is acquiring a famous signature rather than excellent art is beside the point. The buyer could have chosen to love the piece on its own merits or sell it on to some more credulous or indifferent person, but has instead exercised a contractual right to a refund (from the broker). And the broker is, in turn, exercising its contractual right to make the seller carry the cost of the misrepresentation. The seller could have brought the piece to an expert and sold it for cash, as-is and no refunds, but experts are used to such risks and would offer a much lower price. By offloading much of the transactional risk to the broker (compared to, say, advertising it on Craigslist), the seller accepted the broker's conditions.<p>It's all very well to complain about Paypal being terribly mean, but somehow I doubt the original offer of sale was 'possibly-fake violin, buyer beware.' Lots of people sell damaged or otherwise flawed goods on eBay with no problem, but they clearly identify the potential deficiencies so that buyers cannot claim to be surprised after the fact. If authentication disputes are a common issue with used violins, then the seller should have used an authentication service or sold on consignment through a specialty dealer, and accepted the costs involved as a marketing expense.",1325637998

I guess their logic is: ""If we can hire dumb people for less money, and regulate them so they can't make mistakes, we can save money!

However, given the simple nature of the question I am wondering if there is some missing subtext here.<p>One common concern I have heard when folks ask this particular question is that someone will 'steal' their idea and run with it, ruining the chances of fame and fortune.<p>The truth is, ideas are like offspring, they are always more attractive to the progenitor than they are to the unrelated viewer. Many times when an idea is shared in a collective, a number of people will assert that it is a 'stupid' idea, and for folks who did not originally have that idea they will read or hear those comments and believe them more strongly than your assertion that it is a good idea.<p>Further, an idea expression is rarely communicated as clearly as an example of an idea does. So just talking about ideas rarely gets them stolen (except perhaps in the case of movie scripts)<p>Ideas are by their nature <i>unproven</i>, which is to say their merits are a matter of opinion rather than rigor, so few people feel compelled to rip them off or otherwise attempt to develop them.<p>I had the pleasure of working with Bill Joy at Sun Microsystems for several years, and one of the things that struck me about him was his ability to stretch the idea box way out of shape. He proposed some truly horrible ideas, but in the discussion enabled folks to step outside their own limitations and come up with some great things. Certainly not all of Bill's ideas were horrible, but wide ranging discussions were empowering on several levels which one would not have predicted.<p>So if you've got some ideas that you're wondering about, talking about them with others, any others, will help you develop them. Its one of the great things enthusiast clubs are good for, robust discussions about ideas related to club activities.",1325637707

3422092,comment,3419241,3420301,0,0,mikeash,,,"Your comment about not trusting the client confuses me. You don't <i>have</i> to ""trust"" the client to do cryptography for you. You simply define the cryptography it has to do, and if it doesn't do it, then it doesn't produce what you need to log in.<p>This is not an unusual practice, either. For example, any time you log into a remote computer using an ssh key, your ssh client is performing cryptography to authenticate you with the server. There is no problem in doing this, because the only way to perform the cryptography such that the authentication is successful is to have the right secret key. You could certainly write a custom ssh client that does some different cryptography, but that would be pointless, as the result would be an inability to connect.<p>There are, I think, two goals at play here. One is what you linked: preventing replay attacks. That is fairly easily solved by doing a double hash with a randomly generated salt. There is no problem in ""trusting"" the client to do this, because if they don't do it the way you specify, they don't produce the correct result. The only (feasible) way to generate a result that lets you log in is by combining the random salt with the correct password. This is important because otherwise an attacker could sniff your traffic and then impersonate you.<p>The second goal is in not having your password exposed if the site's database is compromised. Related, it would also be nice to not have your password exposed if the site is compromised and the attacker is watching incoming connections.<p>SSL solves the first goal, of preventing replay attacks. Not having your password exposed if the database is compromised is solved by hashing passwords. However, if you send the password in plaintext (or encrypted in such a way that the other end can retrieve plaintext, as with SSL) then the last, related goal fails: an attacker with total control can grab your password if you log in during the time he has control.<p>By doing hashing on the client, you can prevent that, and when implemented properly it can still avoid the rest.",1325637642

They probably didn't examine exactly what was going to happen. They almost certainly didn't plan to buy links or have garbage content be produced. There almost certainly wasn't some evil plot to do all this.<p>But that's not the point. The point is that this did happen, by a company that when others do this, passes out penalties against them, regardless of the excuses. That's why it's an important story, and I'm sorry that's lost on you. It's not lost on many other people.<p>Including Google, by the way. That's why Google's own spam team has penalized Google Chrome's page.",1325636696

3422039,comment,3421648,3421648,0,0,checoivan,,,"The lateness is not that important since phone contracts are up in about 2 years and at the time, people shop for new phones and usually aim for the coolest one as their new phone. Phone markets renew every couple of years but clearly the iphone keeps beating the value(how many iphone's generation 1 do you see on the street?). The iphone was even late to the game but that didn't stop it from taking away the coolness and market of the motorola Razr which everybody wanted and had back then.<p>Another factor is the Windows phone, Android and iPhone have about the same initial and per month cost. Roughly the same price but All 3 give very different values back in terms of apps,feature,ease of use. Coping with the downsides or nuances is also a 2 year commitment so unless an option is clearly way ,way better, people will stick with an iPhone or go back.<p>With pcs it's a different ballpark. A macbook feels nicer than a generic Acer notebook, but one costs $1,500 and the other $499. The phones are all around $199 and plans are about 70 bucks a month. Even if the phone is ""free"" the per month payment is the same.<p>Also the iPhone sets a standard of experience which still is unmatched. If I drove a mercedez, then switched to an Acura and didn't like it as much, it doesn't mean either is bad. Acura is awesome, but I might miss the feeling,driving, status,smell, etc and hold the Acura up the Mercedez standards. Windows phone is stuck in an unconfortable situation where it doesn't give way greater value to an iphone user but doesn't cost way less either to make it into other emerging markets and grab marketshare from somewhere else.",1325636682

3421965,comment,3416900,3421264,0,0,CPlatypus,,,"First, I disagree with the characterization of Red Hat as somehow being a lower tier than Oracle, IBM, or VMware.  During my mostly startup-oriented career I've worked with hundreds of people who later went to those three companies, and in <i>not one</i> of those cases has anyone described an interview process any more rigorous than Red Hat's (with which I'm familiar from both sides).  That's not to say that Red Hat's process is particularly rigorous, but characterizing it as ""hire whoever they can afford"" is simply a lie.  Considering that you just registered a day ago and have only commented on this one thread so far, I can't help wonder if the bit about ""inadequate pay/benefits/conditions and very rarely sponsor H1B"" is a bit of sour grapes.<p>In any case, even the standard you're trying to apply is ridiculous.  People at Google or Facebook might believe that their puzzle-solving interview process ensures that they get only the best employees (how ego-gratifying such a belief must be) but I also know dozens of people who've gone to Google so I know better.  On average those people are pretty good, probably even a little better than the Red Hat average, but only a little.  By the standard of actual talent that's acquired, Red Hat does just fine.  It's simply not true that ""nearly all"" of the talent goes to any three or four companies, no matter how big or prestigious.  The Red Hat contribution to the Linux kernel alone shows that they can match or exceed anyone when it comes to talent in some areas.<p>In fairness, I should point out that it's not all daisies and starlight at Red Hat either.  It's a billion-dollar global company.  Yes, they (we) hire quite a few people in other parts of the world, because - believe it or not - engineering talent is not an exclusively US trait.  Like any company we try to get the best bang for the buck, and sometimes that means hiring elsewhere.  It's not Red Hat's fault that wage scales in the US are unrealistically high.  When you have the ability to coordinate teams in many locations, and talent is available in many locations, you take advantage of it.  This can be difficult to deal with as an employee, as can the fact that the average level of <i>social</i> ability at Red Hat seems a bit lower than average, but it's not an issue of low technical ability as you portray it.",1325635509

On Windows, this can make a grown man cry, especially when you are using a cheap-ish host and haven't ever heard a whisper of ssh.<p>When Platform as a Service came about, layers like database, application, caching, load-balancing were abstracted and delegated, but you still had/have to get the latest version of a project or repo, get the dependencies/CLI, and push it to the server. This involves git, the terminal, pip (easy_install/apt-get). After this, you need to configure your service, which is probably done with environment variables and can not necessarily be prompted as a native interface outside of the shell or terminal. Even so, it's a <i>much</i> better experience, because it means you have to concern yourself with a much narrower knowledge domain, because so much of the stack is abstracted, but there is still a lot to be done. With one-click deploys and such, this may no longer be a problem (and any configuration can be presented in a nice interface, because the gondor guys only need to concern themselves with one particular stack, where this most likely will be set up with environment variables in Python).<p>You might still have a slightly hard time seeing what this exactly means, seeing that there aren't a lot of services to give you an idea, but that's because this obstacle have held back a lot of ideas and projects, and I suspect that we will see a completely new type of services that we couldn't imagine before, because it wasn't possible. We can't extrapolate in the same way from what we are used to, because that would tantamount to imagining that the results of the combustion engine are horses with engines instead of cars.<p>Just imagine that we might be able to deploy an entire web service from an iPad without any proficiency with Bash, ssh nor programming.<p>I guess some hackers will never see this, because they want to mess with the gritty innards of everything, so it is possible that this appeals more to people with iPhones and Macs than those using Androids and Ubuntu. The services are most likely as-is, but when people are paid to maintain and update them, users might be able to create services that ""just work"". And I think the fact that it's a marketplace where people can be paid for the apps mean that we get some very important incentives to create - and maintain! - quality services. Think Apple's App Store.",1325635414

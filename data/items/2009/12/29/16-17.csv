It's important to note that (in the United States at least, I can't speak for other countries), hosting copyrighted information posted by others is not a violation of copyright law, but, once you've been notified that such content exists with the appropriate DMCA request, you are required to take it down (or have the content poster respond to the DMCA request).  This is known as  Safe Harbor , and was, to my knowledge, the reason why google felt comfortable acquiring YouTube.",1262105896

1020740,comment,1020427,1020688,0,0,dalke,,,"I think I pointed that out in my essay when I discussed how one limitation with TDD is that tests must fail, then change the code to pass the test. This doesn't let you add tests which are expected to pass but which are used to assess the validity of the code.<p>One way is make the tests fail, such as by changing the comparison from the expected value to something else, or by forcing an exception at the end of the code. Once the test fails then you know the test is being executed against the expected code, so then change it to make it pass. This is done without modifying the code. It's similar to what you would have to do if you depend on a third-party package which might be buggy. Code coverage is another way to check if the test is actually exercising the code paths you think it should. And yes, in some cases I will insert failures into the code itself, to convince myself that the test is also working, but that's only one of several possibilities.<p>While you make only a single iteration when developing APIs, I find that I many more than that to get the API to feel right, and that API development needs feedback based on implementation. I'll end up with a bunch of semi-tested but reasonable code, which I then test through unit tests, guided by my experience and assisted through code coverage (either manual or automated). It is much easier to make this code work right than it would be to start from scratch.<p>I'm also not sure that I would say ""post hoc"", since it really is a mixture of different types and quality of tests all throughout the development process.",1262105785

1020737,comment,1020392,1020430,0,0,mtomczak,,,"I believe that I see your point, and I would agree that the verbosity of HTML leads to sharability, and that is a strength.<p>But the verbosity is also one of its weaknesses for large projects; it adds a great deal of overhead in terms of keeping track of the tags, especially if the HTML needs to be re-arranged. And with no language-supplied rules for how much whitespace to use or where (beyond ""all adjacent whitespace is compressed""), there is too much flexibility for a large team to work smoothly. My usage case doesn't mesh with your example, because I'm working in an environment with version control and multiple developers. The guy using Notepad will be told to get a tab-aware text editor, because his changes will mangle the whitespace in the file and lead to unnecessary noise when he commits.<p>When structure in your whitespace is already desired (to avoid making your version control noisy), you can leverage the fact that you are structuring the whitespace to make it a semantic element. This greatly decreases typing, makes the code easier to eye-scan, and allows details such as proper closing bracing to be left to the compilation tool and not to the developer. I agree with commenters who have noted that HAML has been proven useful for some developers.<p>I would categorize both SHPAML and HAML as tools that let you be more productive with HTML.",1262105655

If you distribute that application, you must release the source code to the entire application under the GPL.<p>How is that different?  If you're making something for internal use at your company, it means that you don't have to give back.  If you are distributing it to users that are not yourself (or your company), you must make it GPL.<p>2. You cannot relicense code under different licenses unless the license explicitly says that you can.  The GPL doesn't have such a provision.",1209261538

174603,comment,174107,174476,0,0,neilc,,,"I think you can easily get into trouble by looking at only the very richest people: by definition, they are the 1-in-a-million who took the right risks, and got fantastically lucky. Dropping out could very well be high risk, high reward -- but that doesn't mean the overall expected value is particularly high.<p><pre><code>  Dropping out can be a necessary condition due to timing reasons alone.\n</code></pre>\nSure, if you're sitting on an opportunity that is truly once-in-a-lifetime, then dropping out can be justified. But I think that is almost always not the case: if you have opportunities now, you'll have opportunities in a few years once you graduate. Good business ideas are not scarce.<p><pre><code>  There's also the non-trivial issue of losing your most\n  energetic years as a young adult (18-22) by spending them\n  on something other than your life ambition.\n</code></pre>\nI think more people should view entrepreneurship as a <i>career</i>, not as something you do for a few years in your early 20s to make a few quick bucks. IMHO you have 20+ years to start businesses, and there's not much to be gained by rushing. The long-term value of a good education is considerable: credentials, quality of life, networking, and simply a much broader base of knowledge.",1209260923

But on the flip side I've never heard of a legal case involving open source code outside the SCO lawsuit and that was more like extortion.<p>Personally, I've always stuck to using LGPL, MIT, or BSD licensed code in closed source products.",1209260813
174600,comment,174410,174410,0,0,phaedrus,,,"We should remember that not all time is interchangeable; just because you're up to spending 4 hours zonked out watching TV in bed does not mean you are up for spending 4 hours doing useful cognitive work.  Maybe you're tired, hung over, sick, not feeling it, etc.  However, even given this caveat, the author's point still stands.  Because even if 4 hours of TV watching only translates to 1 hour of useful creative work and 3 hours of blah, that's still a huge amount of cognitive surplus.<p>But I think that it is like exercise - just because you watch TV for 4 hours, doesn't mean you could have jogged or rode a bike for 4 hours straight instead; your body isn't up to it.  Why isn't it up to it?  Because you're used to watching TV.  So even if we only get a very poor 4:1 conversion rate at first, as we exercise our minds or bodies at doing other things besides TV, as a society we'll improve that exchange rate.",1209260460

From a rational perspective, of course, companies don't want the US government grabbing their private data.  But from an emotional impact perspective, which seems to be the idea of a pitch, it makes it sound sketchy.<p>Possibly more emotive, and catering to the (annoying) zeitgeist would be ""[...] designed from the ground up to keep your data out of the hands of hackers and cyber-terrorists [...]""",1209259767

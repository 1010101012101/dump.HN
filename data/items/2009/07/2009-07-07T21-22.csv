692648,comment,692338,692546,0,0,jibiki,,,"Sigh.  Here we go, a definition of the real numbers.  I'm only doing this once.<p>Let's look at the set of all cauchy sequences of rational numbers.  A sequence of rational numbers is just a map N->Q.  We write a_0, a_1, a_2, ... for the sequence which maps 0|->a_0, 1|->a_1, 2|->a_2, ...  Such a sequence is called ""cauchy"" if it has the property that:<p><pre><code>  For all epsilon > 0 there exists an N such that n,m > N => |a_n-a_m|<epsilon.
</code></pre>
Basically, this means that the tail of the sequence bunches together.<p>Now, we define an equivalence relation ~ on the space of cauchy sequences.  We say:<p><pre><code>  a_0, a_1, a_2... ~ b_0, b_1, b_2... if:
  a_0-b_0, a_1-b_1 ,a_2-b_2... converges to zero
</code></pre>
(A sequence a_0,a_1,... converges to zero if, for every epsilon > 0, there exists N such that n>N => a_n < epsilon.)<p>Now, the real numbers are the set of equivalence classes of rational cauchy sequences under ~, as defined above.<p>Clearly, .999... is (the equivalence class of):<p><pre><code>  0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...
</code></pre>
And 1 is the equivalence class of:<p><pre><code>  1, 1, 1, ...
</code></pre>
So are these the same?  Well, we have to check if our representatives are equivalent.  Does this sequence converge to 0?<p><pre><code>  1-0.9, 1-0.99, 1-0.999, ...
</code></pre>
Yes, it does.  So 1 = .999...",1247003918

Agile RUP? Been around for years. The true-blue RUP guys will tell you RUP has always been agile, it's just never practiced that way and the corporate pointy-heads make it into a monster. Agile Maturity Model? Lots of companies already have one. Maturity model just means some way of measuring how well the teams are doing. Certification? Heck, this certification bandwagon has always been lucrative, and now it's just getting worse.<p>Agile works because <i>agile has always worked, even before there was some lame-ass marketing phrase called ""agile""</i>. That means your grand-dad working on the Apollo moon shot probably used some agile techniques, as did guys on the Manhattan project.<p>He's absolutely right that corporate America is killing agile. But they've been killing agile for so long it isn't funny. This is a problem that has to do with really smart people and their desire to measure and control. It's really a problem with, guess what, us. As technology wonks we're the first to want to create a new metric or standardize something that doesn't need standardizing.<p>As for the proliferation of certifications, do what I do: just say no. I'm not going to play that game. When you ask me about agile, I'll happily share the actual projects and work I produced, but I'm not going to spend good money buying useless pieces of paper.",1247003843

There are many ways of intervening, some smarter than others.<p>The intervention in Vietnam was poorly-led. Both sides adopted an insane ""war of attrition"" doctrine.

When I do that, I constantly am left with a remainder. If I accept that 1/3=0.3333..., as you're arguing, then the remainder disappears, for unexplained reasons.

As far as I know they can only be en/decoded by Quicktime.</i><p>MOV files have used dozens of different video and audio formats over the years.  Currently, the most common is H.264 video and AAC audio, and they can in fact be played by nearly everything, mainly because the MOV format is basically the same as MP4.  You might have to remux the file though, as there are some subtle differences between MOV and MP4.  Yes, this is yet another reason to hate Apple.<p><i>Cool -- so if I start distributing H.264 videos without paying the appropriate licensing fees, there wouldn't be any trouble, right? And there's an encoder/decoder that I can install legally?</i><p>""Proprietary"" has a very specific meaning in the multimedia format world; it revers to formats like Real Video, VP6, and so forth which are <i>completely closed</i>.  In other words, there is no public specification, nobody can implement an encoder or decoder without reverse-engineering it.  If you want something to describe H.264, say ""patent-encumbered"" or similar; don't misuse words with a specific meaning.<p><i>Obviously you've not used Theora for months or years. It is significantly better than MPEG-4 SP, and on par with H.264 for standard-def video.</i><p>I've read the spec.  Here's the basic summary:<p>1.  Prediction.  DC/AC coefficient prediction is somewhat similar to MPEG-4 Part 2.  Intra prediction is similar, as is motion compensation, which is basically the same as MPEG-2/4 halfpel except that the center position averages between the diagonals instead of all four neighbors, which is slightly lower quality but much faster (a smart decision, H.264 does the same for qpel).  4MV mode is supported in the same way as in MPEG-4 SP.<p>2.  Transform is basically the same as MPEG-2/4, though it's bit-exact like VC-1's and H.264's in order to avoid decoders disagreeing on the correct output.  It's slightly slower though because of how On2 originally designed it.<p>3.  Entropy coder is bizarre but not too terrible; it should probably give results similar to MPEG-4 SP's entropy coder, though I can't be entirely sure just because of how weird it is.  Speed-wise the entropy coder is a real problem, especially for hardware implementations.  The reason for this is because <i>every single data element is coded in a massive bitplane</i>, requiring that the entire frame be decoded before a single inverse transform is done.  This requires a cache larger than the decoded size of the frame itself, as DCT coefficients are stored in 16-bit precision as opposed to the 8-bit precision of the actual pixels.  It's probably fine compression-wise though.<p>That's for residual coefficients though; the primary problem in terms of compression with Theora is the motion vector coding...<p>3a.  Motion vectors can be coded in three modes: ""use the previous vector"", ""use the previous previous vector"", or ""write an entirely new vector"".  The last mode requires writing 12 bits of raw data with no compression; X and Y vector components.  The problem with this is twofold.  First of all, it means you can't have motion vectors longer than 16 pixels, which is crippling for high resolutions.  Second, it means the motion vector coding is actually worse than H.261 (the original standardized video format from 1988); Theora probably loses at least 10-30% compression solely because of this.  It would in fact <i>simplify</i> the specification to fix this, which is why many have been pushing to revise the spec and release a ""Theora 2"".",1247000792

Other than that, no worse, no.<p>Recall that introducing one contradictory premise into a logical system allows you to prove any statement. If you are not bothered by a ""small"" contradiction to prove a dubious point, you don't understand math. Thus, making up definitions to prove a point must be analyzed in the <i>full</i> context of a mathematical system, not just analyzed on some other abstract measurement system (that doesn't matter). Breaking infinity to win an argument doesn't work.<p>...<p>Most people go about proving this the wrong way. Proving something about the string ""1"" vs. "".999..."" is wrong. In order to show the two are distinct entities, you need to show a situation in which they behave differently. No such situation exists. Until you do that, ""1"" = "".9999..."" is no more surprising that ""2/2"" = ""1"". Or (ahem) ""9/9"" = ""1"". Numbers are what they do, they have no existence beyond what they do.<p>On that note, when teaching I think the point that ""="" means ""is bidirectionally fully substitutable by"" is not taught properly. ""2 + 2 = [underline]"" is a flawed question; oh, we all know what it means, but ""2 + 2 = 2 + 2"" is a perfectly correct answer to the question as written. We ought to define a separate operator for what we really mean, ""simplification"", so we can do something like put ""2 + 2 => [underline]"" on a test, and save the equality operator for actual equality.<p>That is also why, for instance, the definition of the square root function must include the stipulation that it takes the <i>positive</i> root, because otherwise ""sqrt(4) = 2"" is <i>not</i> a true statement; if sqrt(4) means ""both"" roots somehow it is <i>not</i> fully substitutable with 2. (You can't say that both ""sqrt(4) = 2"" and ""sqrt(4) = -2"", either, because then ""2 = sqrt(4) = -2"". Oops.)<p>That's the background for my statement that .9999... = 1. It means that there's no way to tease the two apart with any (valid!) mathematical operation. Here's another way to say it: On the real number line, if you have real number A and real number B, and there are no points between A and B, then A and B must be equal. To show they are two different real numbers, you must show a number C between 1 and .9999.... You can not do this... well, again, you can't do this <i>validly</i>.<p>(Also, per RiderOfGiraffe's point, yes, there's some simplification here, but I think it's fair to run on the theory that intrinsic to this argument is that we're on the real number line. People who know enough to talk about transfinite ordinals don't usually get into these arguments; by then, they've learned the secret of math lies in the definitions chosen and understand the ultimately contingent nature of any answer. :) )",1247000613

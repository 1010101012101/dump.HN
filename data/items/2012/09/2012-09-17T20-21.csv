4534863,comment,4533737,4533737,18,0,ricardobeat,,,"Though most examples are not something you'd write normally, this line is what kind of flopped the article for me:<p><pre><code>    Given that CoffeeScript doesnt fix any of the
    fundamental problems of JavaScript
</code></pre>
same for a comment here:<p><pre><code>    coffeescript doesn't bring much to table
</code></pre>
There is <i>so much</i> coffeescript adds that I find these laughable:<p><pre><code>    string interpolation 
    multi-line strings
    comprehensions
    guarded loops (hasOwn...)
    easy constructor/prototype definition (class)
    avoiding global leaks/shadowing
    function binding
    splats, defaults
    safe usage of reserved names
    existential operator
    chained comparisons
    READABLE regular expressions
</code></pre>
This just off the top of my head. These make a <i>huge</i> difference to writing code everyday. I've been writing CoffeeScript for 90% of my projects in the past 2.5 years and it pretty clearly affected my productivity for the better. I can only conclude that whoever says ""coffeescript doesn't add anything"" hasn't really used it for work.<p>Case in point, if you look at the linked article at the end you'll see an update by the author: <i>I actually love CoffeeScript now that I've been writing it for a year</i>.",1347915597

4534861,comment,4532904,4532904,2,0,geebee,,,"I remember reading Colin Powell's autobiography (many years ago).  He wrote about how he was selected for a very elite training program meant to groom military upper management.  When his cohort arrived, they told the room (I'm paraphrasing here) that the selectivity for this program was so intense, and that so many talented people were rejected, that if the plane carrying them crashed and everyone on it died, they could completely replace his cohort from the ""reject"" pile with absolutely no loss of quality.<p>Perhaps smart kids find themselves competing for this kind of thing more often than others?  A 99%ile LSAT score actually does increase your chances of getting into Yale law school over a 97%ile LSAT.  A 3.95 GPA in the sciences really does increase your changes of getting into UCSF med school over a 3.7.<p>It gets even worse when students are aware that their peers are cheating.  I remember reading about a cyclist who admitted to doping and regretted it deeply.  His discussion of why and how he came to cheat was interesting - he said that he could have accepted losing as a non-doper if he'd believed that the people besting him were competing honestly, but that when he realized they were going to win because they cheated and he didn't, he cracked and started doing it too.  And of course, once he's doing it, then even more people realize they'll lose if they aren't doping.  Eventually, it becomes endemic.  Sure, that sounds like a rationalization, but it also provides a very clear illustration of how a large population can essentially corrupt and cheating can become widespread.<p>My guess is that cheating is less common in environments where the measured outcome of learning has little bearing on your opportunities afterwards.  In other words, in environments where you need to meet a standard of competence to graduate, but people aren't especially interested in what your grades were, my guess would be that cheating is far less common.",1347915588

4534855,comment,4534322,4534760,2,0,bradleyland,,,"I can't answer your question about why it's slow in these tests, but I do own Parallels (7), and have used VirtualBox extensively.<p>Some background: I use Parallels for local testing of build-scripts that I use to turn up Rails hosting infrastructure. A ""full stack"" build script turns up some basic compile tools and utilities, Ruby 1.9.3, Apache, Passenger, and MySQL. All of this is built from a base snapshot: a Debian netinst installation with nothing but root and a non-superuser account. No other packages added or configured at install.<p>My scripts write timestamps at the beginning and end of the process. With ""nothing"" running on my host MacBook Pro, Parallels and VirtualBox both take within seconds of each other (around 14m45s) to build an app server, so for my usage, Parallels doesn't represent much of an advantage. I use Parallels for my hosts mostly because I'm familiar with it's configuration tools and supporting application config.

4534853,comment,4534408,4534408,36,0,ynniv,,,"The goal of this diatribe appears to be to justify CoffeeScript's design, but to me it counts against it. To be fair, I have never thought CoffeeScript was worth using, but here's the crux:<p>The pitch: ""CoffeeScript is a better syntax for writing JavaScript.""<p>The reality: ""CoffeeScript does not behave like JavaScript in subtle, non-syntactical ways.""<p>It is often suggested that people use CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript. But this understanding of CoffeeScript is inaccurate. CoffeeScript has different semantics from JavaScript, and the obvious expansion of CoffeeScript back into JavaScript is a wrong expansion. A knowledgeable JavaScript developer will make mistakes when making simple changes to CoffeeScript code that they did not write. They will have difficulty fixing bugs in CoffeeScript code.<p>If you like, you can be a CoffeeScript shop. Find senior developers who use CoffeeScript and teach junior developers to use it. Code will be a little easier to write, and, like nerf guns and foosball, you might seem like a superficially cool place to work. Like any new technique, you'll be out on your own. You'll run into bugs, you'll deal with toolchain support, you'll find optimization issues.<p>There are reasons to translate other languages into JavaScript. Macros, static typing, execution in other contexts. CoffeeScript gives you ruby-like syntax... To me, that just doesn't seem worth it.",1347915476

I started life as an Emacs user, switched to Vim, flip-flopped between the two for various tasks. The whole time, in the background, I was playing with Plan 9 and Acme; eventually I got sufficiently addicted to Acme that I dropped Emacs and Vim for most of my editing. I still use Emacs as a mail reader (and nothing else), Vim for quick edits or working on a remote system, and Acme for everything else.<p>I don't actually take the Plan9Ports thing as far as I could (I work on Linux, mostly, often with a drawterm connection open to our Plan 9 server). I run a plumber, and Acme, but I don't run rio (the window manager) or 9term (the xterm replacement), which means I'm going to miss out on some of the plumbing stuff.

This has nothing to do with data validation.<p>Rapidly changing schemas are a PITA in RDBMSes, especially with a large cluster of servers.  It's usually very easy to alter schemas on-the-fly with NoSQL systems.

She often wears clothes by designers Calvin Klein, Isabel Toledo, Narciso Rodriguez, Donna Ricco and Maria Pinto,[98] and has become a fashion trendsetter,[99][100][101] She appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[103][104] Every First Lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in Vogue,[103] but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover.[105  In August 2011 she became the first woman to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine, as well as the first person to appear on the cover in 48 years.

4534604,comment,4533737,4533737,37,0,ilaksh,,,"Just because you CAN do something in CoffeeScript doesn't mean you SHOULD, or should ALL of the time.  Just like in JavaScript where, if you want, you can write all of your code on one line, but you shouldn't.<p><pre><code>    action true
      option1: 1
      option2: 2
</code></pre>
If you really use CoffeeScript regularly, that isn't confusing.  I don't usually write it that way though.  I would do this:<p><pre><code>  options =
    a: 1
    b: 2
  action true, options
</code></pre>
doSomething () ->  'hello' just isn't valid code.<p>Usually I would write<p><pre><code>    doSomething ->
      return 'hello'
</code></pre>
or maybe<p><pre><code>    doSomething -> 'hello'
</code></pre>
If you write it the way he did, the parenthesis are confusing.<p>For this one:<p><pre><code>    action = (token, i) ->
        @tokens.splice i, 0, @generate 'CALL_END', ')', token[2]
</code></pre>
-- first of all, you always want to indent two spaces.  But the main problem with that is in CoffeeScript you do need to use parenthesis after the first call because your code will be unreadable otherwise.  You just can't write it the way he did.<p><pre><code>    moveTo 10,
      20
      10

    doSomething 1,
    2
    3
    4

    doSomething 1,
      2
        3
       4
</code></pre>
Those are ridiculous examples.  No one does that.  You just write moveTo 10, 20, 10<p><pre><code>    doSomething (->
    'hello'), 1
</code></pre>
Indentation is significant in CoffeeScript, just like it is in Python.  Just having a parenthesis shouldn't change that.  Anyway, what I do is this:<p><pre><code>    somethingDo = (ms, func) ->
      doSomething func, ms
</code></pre>
and then I can just write<p><pre><code>    somethingDo 1, ->
      'hello'



    action(key: value, option: value, otherValue)
</code></pre>
You don't write it like that if the function takes two objects.  You would probably just write<p><pre><code>    action {key: value}, {option: value}, otherValue


    x = {
      key1
      key2
      key3: value3
    }
</code></pre>
This is called destructuring assignment, and its part of the new ECMAScript.  Its useful to not have to repeat key1, key2 everywhere when the variable with the value has the same name as the object property.  The extra curly braces are just necessary to differentiate from the normal syntax.<p>Sometimes yes/no or on/off are more readable than true/false.  That's an advantage.<p><pre><code>    x = 1 if y != 0;
</code></pre>
Don't use semicolons in CoffeeScript.  I also don't put if statements at the end of a line because I don't believe that is very readable for most people including me.  Also, in CoffeeScript its probably better to use isnt instead of !=, although rather than !=, you would want !==.<p><pre><code>    if y isnt 0
      x = 1
</code></pre>
I'm not that sure about the use of unless, although it probably is a little bit more readable overall.<p><pre><code>  break for [tag], i in @tokens when tag isnt 'TERMINATOR'
  @tokens.splice 0, i if i
</code></pre>
He says that is supposed to delete TERMINATOR from tokens.  I tested it, it doesn't do anything, and the second example of the correct way doesn't work either.  I think he meant this:<p><pre><code>    filtered = []
    for token, i in tokens
      if not (i is 0 and token is 'TERMINATOR')
        filtered.push token


    i += block.call this, token, i, tokens while token = tokens[i]
</code></pre>
Another example of something you CAN do in CoffeeScript but shouldn't.  Actually it is a bad idea in general.  I think a CoffeeScript programmer would actually write something like this:<p><pre><code>    class Parser      
      block: (token) =>         
        @currentNode.push new Token(token)
      parse: =>
        for token in tokens
          @block token
        </code></pre>
I would never write something like 'mainModule.moduleCache and= {}'<p>Instead of<p><pre><code>    js = (parser.parse lexer.tokenize code).compile options

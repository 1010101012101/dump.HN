2831874,comment,2831455,2831838,3,0,StavrosK,,,"Very true, but these are rather trivial concerns compared to A/B testing. With A/B testing you still need a large amount of samples, but you also need to specify the (usually arbitrary) parameters, and decide when to stop the test on top of that.<p>The challenging aspects seem more of a limitation, but you still would be testing things all the time, ostensibly, rather than test once in the beginning and then stay there. I'd imagine some of the algorithms have a window of data to consider, rather than everything since the beginning.<p>You could also discard old data to make sure past actions don't impact your performance now.<p>Overall, the technique isn't a miracle cure, of course, but it's leaps and bounds better than the split tests we have now.",1312203491

There are always people who will vote for censorship and slavery in order to maximize the exploitation of other people fot the benefit of themselves and theif offspring. the fact that there are always people willing to support and profit from opression does not mean that everybody else should not condemn, fight and try everything they can to end it.<p>As of now, copyright is not democratically supported. It is directed and enforced against the majority for the benefit of a influential minority, but it was never, anywhere on this planet, supported by any kind of democratic vote by the people. It originated in a dictatorship and has been spread behind closed doors and shielded by various party mechanisms from a direct popular vote, because the probable result of this vote would be a ""no"".<p>The turmoil around ACTA, where even talking about the negotiations was a no-go disguised as ""national security"" to prevent any opposition to even form, has shown that the politics around copyright is as undemocratic as ever.<p>I do not feel any moral obligation whatsoever to obey such a authoritarian law clearly not backed by the majority of my peers.

2831866,comment,2831455,2831455,8,0,paraschopra,,,"This is interesting (and I'm yet to study the algorithm in detail) but I guess you are comparing two dissimilar problems. One is hypothesis testing and other is continuous optimization.<p>The reason A/B testing has many parameters is because at the end of data collection it hopes to employ a hypothesis test to determine whether variation was better performing as compared to control (the interpretation of ""better"" is done according to parameters defined). The confidence level and other parameters allow you to do proper risk-reward analysis and see if you want to go ahead with variation. Moreover, minimal sample size (visitors/conversions) ensures that local (initial) fluctuations do not unnecessarily bias the test results. In fact, in A/B test first 100 visitors are virtually identical to last 100 visitors with regards to impact on final results.<p>However, I am guessing in bandit algorithms (since their primary usage is continuous optimization and not hypothesis testing) local fluctuations can have an adverse impact on ultimate results which may be okay for continuous optimization problems but not for projects where you need to determine with a defined level of confidence whether one version works better than the other.<p>Different needs, different algorithms.",1312203348

I did my B.Sc. in computer science in 2004. My dream since second year of my graduation was to have my own startup, my own company where we can develop quality software products. After my graduation I worked as intern(SAP ABAP Developer) at a large indian IT company. As I excelled in my work there and was better than most of the experienced programmer there, they offered me a permanent position in the company. I worked there for 2 more years and got tired of the boring corporate culture. There was no more real work left and I just got my salary doing nothing. It was frustrating as I always wanted to do quality work. I felt like my life was leading to nowhere. Besides that my ambition was to startup my own business. So, I played a gamble and it backfired.<p>I quit my job and started a company with one of my college time buddies. We developed Hospital Information System that took more than a year and half as we were only two guys. We sold our product to few hospitals but ultimately it was a big failure. We kept trying to improve it and re market it but it didn't worked and then we got frustrated. Out of frustration we tried our hands on other projects but we were not able to work with same enthusiasm anymore. Two months back we decided to shut the shop.<p>So here is my current situation. I'm 28 year old bachelor with a BSc in Computer science degree, 2 years of experience as SAP ABAP Developer, and 4 wasted years as director of a business venture that failed. I am good at both programming and designing and can do a lot of other things but currently in such a depressing mindset that I am unable to focus on it for more than 2-3 hours a day. I have many startup ideas that are really worth trying but now I doubt if I'm gonna complete it if I start working on those. I feel like I have the talent but not the mental toughness to do any meaningful work. Lack of success for 4-5 years have dented my self belief.<p>I don't know what to do in such situation. Having my own successful company was always my dream. I have the skills and ideas but no partner and finance. What should I do? Is there any way out of it?",1312203015

I run into a lot of this through my affiliation with Mogotest.

For example, it stipulates that combatants in an international armed conflict are required to distinguish themselves from the civilian population (normally by wearing a uniform) while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack. In addition, IHL prohibits indiscriminate attacks and provides for the principle of proportionality, which dictates that the so called ""incidental loss"" of civilian life and/or property should not be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. In order to implement the restrictions and prohibitions on targeting, specific precautions must also be observed by all Parties to an armed conflict.""<p>For more information, you can try googling ""Principle of Distinction""",1312202722

More so, it's a great example of machine learning used all too wrong.<p>You can blindly apply machine learning to almost any corpus and ""predict"" almost anything with 60% accuracy without gaining any real understanding of the corpus or the correlations you're trying to tease out.  Often the only reason you can do better than guessing at all is because your corpus isn't perfectly unbiased itself.  And with 60% accuracy, good luck using the results for anything!<p>This is doubly the case here, where they're actually just using word frequency, not a real analysis of sentence structure.  It's the simplest, dumbest form of natural-language-based machine learning, and it shows.  I've used the tool derived from their research and it's beyond useless: it classifies every single one of my posts wildly differently.<p>Because it's solely based on a few dozen words' frequencies, it's more affected by the <i>topic</i> than anything else.

To a first approximation, I'd describe any service I can get into with a web browser and a credit card but no strings pulled on my behalf as ""launched.""  But if Marketing says that it isn't really, truly launched until TC gets their exclusive, I would not burn my karma arguing with Marketing over the point.",1312200452

I'm assuming you've never had your appartment broken into and ransacked.<p>And reading EJ's story, it's somewhat worse than your average break-in-plus-digging-for-valuables. Same for the guy in this article, seems about just as bad. My initial thought was ""sounds like the same people"", but more likely the common denominator is ""meth-crazed junkie binge"".<p>If there's one thing you can blame EJ is that her stories are a bit of the rambling-longwinded-trying-to-be-a-writer-please-get-to-the-point sort. But that's neither here nor there.<p>What I don't quite understand is, I read that in order to prevent under-the-table deals (where AirBnB wont get commission), AirBnB won't let you communicate with the guest until just before they go there? Anyone got some details on that? Cause if that's so, they DO have some responsibility to make sure these people are trustworthy, preventing the subletter from finding out themselves.

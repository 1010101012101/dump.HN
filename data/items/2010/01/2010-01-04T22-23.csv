Intel can sell a processor with over 1 billion transistors (Itanium) for less than $250 and break even, even though instead they sell it for thousands because it's appropriate to do so in Itanium's target market. IBM can't sell a CELL (no pun intended) for anywhere near that little without taking a loss.<p>Of course, a more appropriate comparison to Itanium is POWER since it's aimed at the same market -- IBM charges upwards of $10k per socket compared to $2500 per socket, and yet IBM's hardware sales aren't by themselves profitable; most of IBM's revenues are from consulting, service, and software sales.

Using an OS's comments/metadata field to store tags and include them in a desktop-search program -- the comments/metadata field is not compatible between operating systems and can be lost while copying files between filesystems or operating systems, so this is not a robust solution. And currently only OS X supports comments/metadata field for all file types.<p>2. Using a central database that does all the file-to-tag association -- this may be 'less universal' or robust than #1; to be cross-platform this requires someone to write a new program that plugs into a given OS and runs constantly monitoring files in case you move or rename them.<p>3. Storing the tags in the filename itself -- this will give you long, ugly filenames, but should be the most robust because all of the modern OS's and filesystems support 256 character filenames (usually including the path) which gives plenty of room for a number of tags separated by some kind of delimiter character e.g. filename###tag1#tag2#tag3.ext . This would need just a simple tag-management program to help you tag files (and can function as a nice file explorer as well, like <a href=""http://www.nudgenudge.eu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nudgenudge.eu</a> and its clone <a href=""http://lunarfrog.com/taggedfrog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lunarfrog.com/taggedfrog</a>) which does not need to be constantly running, and could use whatever desktop-search program to use the files.<p>Therefore at the moment I think #3 would be the most robust and versatile solution. Then someone just has to make a frontend for file renaming and tag-database storage/rebuilding from filenames/viewing...",1262644877

Some people will always steal, just because they think it's fun.  Don't waste your time on these people; spend your time adding value for the people that actually pay for your software.  If your anti-pirate protection is buggy, you will piss off the people who are already paying for your software.<p>As an example, take the movie industry.  Their ""war on piracy"" has ensured that I will never pay for (or watch) a major movie again.  When you pirate a movie, it's HD, and it plays on any device.  You don't need a special cable, you don't need an HDCP-capable surge protector (or whatever).  You can fast-forward whenever you want, and you can't be forced to watch ads or the ""don't pirate this"" propaganda.  If you have a fast connection, you can usually watch the movie as it downloads.  All in all, a great user experience.<p>When you pay for a movie, though, all that is out the window.  You have to watch ads.  You can't have HD unless you have a special cable and a special monitor.  You can't watch the movie on a portable device.  You can't download the movie; you have to walk to the store, pick something up, talk to a clerk, and carry the movie home.  You have to buy a lot of stuff you don't need, you get less features, and you have to pay $20 for the privilege.<p>The movie industry thinks these piracy countermeasures discourage piracy, but actually, they make not pirating the product extremely unappealing.

The easy games that are good will still quickly defeat the player if he does not interact in an appropriate and effective manner even though the player still knows exactly how to engage in those interactions.  A hard game that is good is <i>fair</i> about its difficulty and the skill challenges provide the player a way to attune their play to the required interaction with coherent and consistent feedback.",1262642994

See: <a href=""http://www.taxfoundation.org/UserFiles/Image/Blog/ftsbs-large.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxfoundation.org/UserFiles/Image/Blog/ftsbs-larg...</a><p>Also, there are a variety of problems at work here, in no order:
1 - property taxes are basically frozen as long as you own your home, eviscerating the most stable form of local tax revenue for cities and counties (and not to mention screwing any newcomers);
2 - government via direct balloting initiatives, freezing spending on various popular causes which cannot be changed via the legislature unless the ballot initiative specifically allows this (and none, to my knowledge, do).  Note this essentially freezes certain spending, which means that when cuts come, other areas have to bear far more than their proportionate burden;
3 - the same law that created situation #1 also requires 2/3 vote to raise taxes;
4 - enough republicans in the senate from conservative areas of CA to basically veto all tax increases;
5 - long term mismanagement of the states finances, increasingly relying on borrowing to pay the bills, which is now starting to come due;
6 - term limits, which both inhibit professionalization of the legislature while simultaneously insuring that legislaters aren't around to be confronted with the consequences of their laws;
7 - horrific effects of the financial crisis, particularly the housing bubble, as the cost of even the most modest homes rose far above the median incomes (see commuter cities where 15+% of houses have been in foreclosure!);
8 - a populace which seems unwilling to bring the costs of desired government services in line with our net tax proceeds, though the fact that the politicians hasn't been blunt about delivering this message has massively compounded this problem;
9 - as mentioned, CA is getting utterly screwed on federal taxes;
10 - it's also worth noting that CA also has a very powerful prison industrial complex that is seemingly immune to reform, and we bear huge costs related to the US' retarded drug policy which goes out of it's way to line the pockets of both the police and prison guards while not actually, say, reducing the costs to society in any way, along with the moral burden of ruining so many peoples' lives;
11 - Arnold Schwarzenegger -- the man is a venal moron, directly responsible (via the cuts to the car taxes), for simultaneously cutting tax income while increasing spending;
12 - effects of the financial crisis, which have dramatically raised borrowing costs for the state.  Note this is even after the effects of borrowing to pay bills; the state borrows to pay bills in the normal course of operations until tax revenues come in towards the end of the year; this suddenly costs a lot more.
13 - etc, etc; i'm sure there are more, but I think these are the primary drivers",1262642799

1031339,comment,1031197,1031197,0,0,lmkg,,,"I think the article is oversimplifying the issue, but it's still an important and relevant view that a lot of gamers don't want to believe. Most people don't play games for the challenge, we play it for the fun. Overcoming obstacles is one way, of several, to achieve this.<p>Ninja Gaiden is fine. It's a good game. It's hard, but it's not hard just for hardness' sake, it's not a jackass about it (usually). Ninja Gaiden was the best example I've seen of a game that makes the player rise to the challenge and become better at the game. There are a lot of games I've seen that are simply cheap and frustrating, losing sight of the 'fun & games' aspect of gaming just to raise the difficulty bar. These games shoot themselves in the foot by severely restricting their appeal. For example, the Medal of Honor series never interested me because too often, it uses the 'challenge' of making the player memorize with millimeter-precision a route through the level, with no way to find the path without getting shot in the face a statistically significant number of times.<p>However, the issue isn't really about how hard or easy the game is. The issue is appealing to different audiences. How do you appeal to the hardcore and casual audiences at the same time? One way is by offering difficulty levels (another is auto-adjusting the difficulty, like Max Payne), although some absurd fraction of people just choose ""medium"" and be done with it. Another way is having a more continuous range of success available, with different difficulties. This is why achievement systems are such a good idea. They let the user cherry-pick how much challenge they want to deal with, as well as when and which types.<p>This is not to say that hardcore tough-as-nail games shouldn't exist. They have a right to exist. However, they should be made with the awareness that they're niche products, and that the majority of the game-buying public (now that the majority of the public buys games) is looking for some entertainment and not a lifestyle.<p>There's also a lot that can be done to make difficult games more palatable, and even appealing. As as said above, Ninja Gaiden does a good job of making the player better at the game. Giving the appearance of progress is important, even if the player is nominally failing, they'll feel better if they're getting closer to succeeding. The most important quality is simply the appearance of fairness, which varies wildly and is totally subjective. Quite simply, if the player blames the game for being hard he'll quit, but if he thinks do better and beat it he'll most likely continue.",1262642430

Though if they're building a basic website, rudimentary PHP would be less hassle, and if they're building a web app and want familiar territory, Cappuccino would be a better choice.<p>The trend in web apps is to do more of the work client side through Javascript (see GWT, SproutCore and Cappuccino) so a new server side framework seems a bit late to the party.<p>Performance as a result of compiled code seems to be the only real selling point, and in my experience, server-side code performance is not a widespread problem...<p>I don't begrudge someone hacking together something new for the fun of it, but this comes across as a real company trying to make a profit.<p>Who's going to actually use this?",1263254049

Unlike Windows, your router isn't going to keep popping up little bubbles to tell you to update.""<p>And if your company values its security at all, they should be certain that their IT people are checking for such things.  They know the hardware, so they know the websites where exploits / updates are listed.  Have a folder of bookmarks, and check it once a week, and you wouldn't be caught off-guard by (relatively) ancient exploits.  The alternative is equivalent to a company using the oldest version of XP, expecting there to be no security problems because they aren't <i>looking</i>, and don't want to risk updating to a more secure system.  Bring on the viruses / script kiddies!<p>I'll agree that upgrades can cause troubles, sometimes extreme, but they should be <i>expected</i> at some point in the future.  Expecting otherwise is expecting your hardware / software to be eternally flawless, which is ludicrous.  Even something as simple as a light switch sometimes needs to be repaired / replaced, and that's just a physical switch, almost literally as simple as it can be.  If you continued using a light switch that sparked and smoked every time you switched it <i>for a year</i>, and your house burns down, you really only have yourself to blame.  Sure, replacing it means calling in an electrician, or doing it yourself, both of which bring their own dangers, but when the alternative is relatively <i>likely</i> catastrophic failure eventually, it's probably worth it.",1263254017

First I'd set up a script that curled a couple URLs and emailed me if it didn't work. I wanted slightly more sophisticated monitoring and I wanted text messages. So I tried to install Nagios. It was a pain and I never got it set up.<p>Then SiteCanary posted their launch here. I signed up that day and never thought about monitoring again. It's worth every penny (and it's really cheap). I'm sure I'd otherwise be spending at least an hour a month on monitoring.",1263252186

Is it better to take the leap (i.e. should I give my 2 weeks notice from my current job), create a rough prototype of the product and then try to find co-founders based on the prototype?  Or is better for me to try to find a co-founder that I can convince to help me with the idea and then take the leap (i.e. quit day job) to develop the prototype.  What's hard for me is that without a 80% working prototype to share with potential co-founders, it's much harder to convince them that the concept is valid via power point slide decks, etc.  From reviewing some history on Mint, it seems like Aaron Patzer went solo first, and then convinced people to join him based on his prototype.

That's why if you check out the concept of virtual company, it's a great way to start working with someone else with limited committment.<p>To me, first and foremost, the fact that you don't have any out of pocket expenses is a good thing, it eliminates one barrier to entry. Virtual companies achieve that. In comparison, joining a ""real"" incorporated startup as co-founder, the first thing you do is split the legal costs and buy your shares. So right there, a few thousand dollars before you even know if you should work together. And there is no ""undo"" button, unlike virtual companies.<p>That's also why in the co-founders meetup I ask the presenters to not only present their business, but reveal a bit of their own personality. I believe that compatibility as co-founders comes equally from being passionate about the same things but also being compatible personality-wise (read this <a href=""http://blog.fairsoftware.net/2009/11/19/first-co-founders-meetup-lessons-learned/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fairsoftware.net/2009/11/19/first-co-founders-me...</a> for more on the topic).",1263251648

- Therefore, we cannot barter.<p>This is unfounded: The subjectivity of value does not make bartering impossible. Bartering is possible if one judges their own work to have less value or equal value to some other work that they are willing to exchange it for; and vice-versa.<p>However, I agree with the article that bartering may be undesirable; but the value argument is incorrect.",1423702679

9036730,comment,9034673,9034673,0,0,abalone,,,"Totally sanitizes the role of military power and research in explaining why the U.S. is economically dominant. This is like looking at the British Empire and saying it happened because Britain had some smart, hardworking entrepreneurs.<p>Countries like China are emerging in part because they have strong governments that just take money from the public and put it into industry. It&#x27;s more more direct than having to come up with some military justification for it like we do in the U.S., like we have to invent lasers to shoot down Russian missiles, and then maybe later we can find some health care applications. It&#x27;s quite inefficient. But figuring out a more efficient way runs directly counter to the self-congratulatory mythology of the Silicon Valley private sector.<p>Sam pins it all on &quot;an environment that encourages investment, welcomes immigrants, rewards risk-taking, hard work, and radical thinking, and minimizes impediments to doing new things.&quot; This is a very rose-colored, sanitized view of American power.<p>There&#x27;s also the little matter of <i>winning WWII</i> while our chief competitors had their economies wrecked, then using that hegemony to maintain effective control of the primary energy reserves of the world, keeping major military competitors in check and keeping Third World nations from breaking out of their subservient role through massive applications of violence and political intervention.<p>Turning to Silicon Valley, our meritocracy of innovation, Sam completely omits the massive sustained and critical <i>military subsidy</i> of Silicon Valley and the startup sector via government research and procurement to the tune of many billions per year, which has been the genesis of everything from the Internet to GPS to Siri.[1] This is to be expected coming from the private sector which loves to congratulate itself and claim it&#x27;s all because of smart, hardworking entrepreneurs -- and therefore entitled to the full profits of the commercialization of government-funded research.<p>But if we are to rethink how to keep America economically dominant, it should start with a sober and clear understanding that it has always come from <i>massive</i> state intervention in the economy, starting with the very nurturing, protectionist policies we forbid the Third World from adopting, and continuing today with high-tech taxpayer-funded research via agencies such as DARPA and government procurement of early-stage products.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s-all-because-of-smart-innovators-in-the-private-sector&quot; is a tenant that investors must hold to justify taking all the profits without returning the lion&#x27;s share to taxpayers -- and more generally to justify funneling taxpayer money to industry without taxpayer <i>control</i> of industry. That is the function that the military-industrial system has served for the past century or so: public investment without public control. Because if the public did more directory control funds we&#x27;d probably steer a bit more towards education, health, public welfare, etc.<p>Let&#x27;s have more real talk about how our system works.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/technology/report/2012/12/10/47481/the-high-return-on-investment-for-publicly-funded-research/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/technology/report/20...</a>",1423702621

If you go to the source article, Clausen says,<p>“First, it seems like a rather remarkably lucky shot in the dark for a person to suspect the presence of a specific toxin on so little evidence,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Couple this with the observation that ODAP is only reported in certain plants of the genus lathyrus which is not the genus hedysarum and the conclusions are even more remarkable (though not impossible). I would be much more convinced if I was reading the report from a credible peer-reviewed professional journal such as the Journal of Natural Products or equivalent. I have often heard a key indicator of bad science that is highly suspect is having its results published in the popular media.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Again, I don&#x27;t make any claims that the report is wrong since I have no data to analyze, but I am skeptical and will remain so until I see a better forum for the results to be published in.&quot; [1]<p>which to me sounds reasonable and, as a professional scientist, sounds just like what I (and I expect, my colleagues) would say.  The peer review process isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is consistently superior to the crap that is scientific journalism appearing outside of peer reviewed journals.  Here&#x27;s why, and why I don&#x27;t understand why you would hold Krakauer as an example of citizen science.<p>Krakauer made (by his own admission) a &quot;rash intuitive leap&quot; [2] that an unidentified alkaloid contributed to McCandless&#x27; death, based on one of McCandless&#x27; journal entries and unpublished preliminary research by Clausen.  As an aside, if one wants to piss off a scientist, that&#x27;s a good way to go about it.  When Clausen completes his research and finds the mystery alkaloid theory doesn&#x27;t work, Krakauer intuits that a mystery toxic mold must have been involved, a theory he announces on Oprah and NPR.  This second theory doesn&#x27;t hold up (as was demonstrated by Clausen, again).  Despite your conjecture, it sounds like Clausen actually investigated Krakauer&#x27;s theories, up to a point.  Krakauer then latches on to ODAP, which was close but still not there.  His fourth theory may be correct, but Krakauer disseminated a lot of incorrect information along the way.  I wonder, did he publish retractions as a professional scientist would?<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you would hold Krakauer&#x27;s methodology as &quot;citizen science FTW&quot;, but I&#x27;m interested to hear.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.adn.com/article/20130917/krakauers-wild-theory-mccandless-gives-short-shrift-science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adn.com/article/20130917/krakauers-wild-theory-mc...</a>

However, before we can make a confident recommendation for routine use, which we estimate would cost the NHS about £58 million in the first year, rising to over £80 million in 5-years, we need more information.&quot;<p>&quot;Alexion insisted that its information about the overall cost of eculizumab be kept confidential and so NICE is unable to share these details of the Alexion submission with stakeholders. We&#x27;re disappointed about this decision, for which we have not had an adequate explanation.&quot;<p>But note that people who were critically ill did get the med, for the £8 NHS prescription charge.  From your link<p>> A spokesperson for NHS England, said: &quot;Patients who are critically ill and who need Eculizumab urgently will receive it.&quot;<p>So: people who needed it were getting it. At first they were getting it under the named patient scheme and they only had to pay the normal NHS prescription fee; now it&#x27;s available under an interim commissioning policy from NHS England - so, again, patients only pay normal NHS prescription fees. For a short time some people who were ill but not dying did not get it, but that gap in provision was caused by the manufacturer not communicating with the regulators.<p>Since you mention the US: how many people were denied this expensive med by their insurance companies?",1423700538

Corruption seems also to have played a major role; many Chinese shells appear to have been filled with cement or porcelain, or were the wrong caliber and could not be fired. Philo McGiffin noted that many of the gunpowder charges were &quot;thirteen years old and condemned.&quot;[2] What little ammunition was available was to be preserved for a real battle. Live ammunition training was rarely carried out.&quot;<p>And of course, corruption and ineffective organisation are qualities that states will gain over time - the longer a state is in power the more corrupt it will become, until one day it collapses.<p>Chinese technology is perfectly capable of defeating Europeans with superior technology in battle. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Liaoluo_Bay"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Liaoluo_Bay</a>

9036568,comment,9034678,9035983,0,0,Theodores,,,"In the UK we have plenty of old houses where there is no central heating, double glazing, loft insulation or fitted carpet. Typically the windows are wood framed &#x27;sash&#x27; windows with the walls made from quite thick stone (1 - 4+ ft thick). Heating might be just the one fireplace with the kitchen cooker also there to warm the house up. I grew up in such a house and not once did I see mould.<p>Typically such houses were built centuries ago for &#x27;cottage industries&#x27; such as making cloth. Back then family sizes were much larger so herds of children would also warm the place up. There might also be an actual herd of animals too - pets as well as livestock, e.g. goats.<p>Also changed is global warming - the pipes would freeze in the 1970&#x27;s. Nowadays, nada.<p>There was an art to keeping warm. Most important - the fire. This would be open and powered by coal or wood. It would not be &#x27;turned on&#x27; until the evening or early afternoon if it was the weekend (in winter). Once started the fire would suck air from wherever possible so that was the primary source of a draft. To mitigate the draft thick curtains would be the thing. The front door would have a curtain as would internal doors to the living room.<p>If you wanted to keep the fire &#x27;in&#x27; for the next day you could smother the fire in coal and keep the ashes in underneath. Air would by restricted that way so the fire would slowly burn through the available fuel. Rake it through in the morning, top up with more coal and perhaps some kindling (a word I haven&#x27;t used in a while) and the fire would live another day. The default would be &#x27;off&#x27; though.<p>As for clothing, one word - layers. Wool rather than cotton or anything else. The layers approach also worked for the bed. If you were lucky you might have a hot water bottle, otherwise no heat in the bedrooms.<p>Due to the thick stone walls heat would be retained in winter and cold during summer. Consequently, regardless of the time of year, there would never be &#x27;T-Shirt&#x27; weather indoors. You would be acclimatised to the cold and expect to see your breath in most of the house mid winter. There would also be that thing where the side of you facing the fire would be red hot whilst your back would be freezing. To solve this problem you would need the air to circulate, so no standing right in front of the fire, blocking the heat, even if that was very pleasurable to do.<p>A cast iron fire grate would be red hot and in your living room. Today&#x27;s central heating does not do &#x27;red hot&#x27; in the living room - radiators don&#x27;t glow bright red like that although electric &#x27;bar&#x27; fires get close.<p>As for showers, a bath, once a week was it. We actually had a copper bath in front of the fire and that was filled with a hose connected to a twin-tub washing machine. Emptying the bath involved making an actual siphon, there was none of this &#x27;plug&#x27; and &#x27;plumbing&#x27; convenience. Needless to say it was very easy to dry off in front of the fire and towels would be toasty.<p>Personally I prefer watching a fire to watching TV.",1423700062

In fact, the minimum credit structure per semester is such that you will necessarily have completed in 2 years and graduate.<p>The reason I was allowed to have a lower credit per semester was because I was employed as a research assistant (which is usually for PhD&#x27;s and is not granted to masters students who are expected to do courses), which makes it so that if I just maintained my status and did not overload courses, I would graduate in 5 semesters.<p>My question was on the fact that I could graduate in 4 if I wanted by taking an extra course this semester( I could have in 3 but that would have led to either compromising on the quality of my studies or of the research).

I think it has to do with culture, how people were brought up. I don&#x27;t remember the proper term for this, but people are pressured to make money. Call it peer pressure for all and from all sides.<p>It is expensive to live in China. It is very expensive to own a house. Here in NYC I can own a decent house in a very good neighborhood for $500,000 - $600,000. A software engineer with a couple years of experience and working for a decent company can afford the mortgage.<p>Here in America I  help my parents with their mortgage (well after all I am also on the paper). But they are okay with me not paying, yet I do because I can afford to help them! But in China, people will talk shit behind your back and people look down on you if you don&#x27;t help with mortgage or if you don&#x27;t own a house. Every Chinese New Year you are expected to give out red envelope. $100? No way. You visit someone&#x27;s place? Gift. I know we do that here in America too, but when was the last time you actually visit your uncle and give him a nice whiskey?<p>Here in America you can get married without even owning a property.

Who cares if you worked as a government official? or whether you are literate or not if you don&#x27;t own a farm or some livestock? Actually in China today there is a 70-year land-use right. You can own a piece of land for 70-year...<p>It has a lot to do with culture, how people were brought up. When everyone started to show off how well their children are doing, everyone are now suddenly in a race for better. Many couples have to break off because their parents believe the child deserves better.<p>But you have a great point about social welfare though. In China social welfare is very hard to get. In the U.S. you can move to CA and get tax benefit if you declare yourself as CA resident after a few months, but in China you can&#x27;t just move to another province (&quot;state&quot;).

They&#x27;re not, no sane person would think so, but they are <i>a static, syntactic proof system pertaining to the meaning of your programs</i> and there&#x27;s a lot to be said for such technology.<p>I am happy to quibble exact points made in this rant, but I&#x27;m on my phone so for now I&#x27;ll merely say that there&#x27;s a large design space of programming languages and a similarly large (perhap today larger) space of type theories. Matching them up to hit all of your tradeoffs is hard, but there have been some great successes and I would happily contend that any professional programmer owes it to themselves to explore this design space &quot;in anger&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m also happy to generally claim that faster, more complete feedback is better than the opposite. Static systems of all regards are faster than &quot;dynamic&quot; ones, and most of them are more complete. This is where you hear about comparisons of types (especially dependent ones) and tests. It&#x27;s <i>great</i> stuff to think about and explore.<p>Further, I want to emphasize that SMT solvers are fascinating too and nobody thinks that they&#x27;re not. The style of proof they provide is more expressive and less certain, though, so the right answer is to know how to combine all of these modes of evidence.",1423699265

I guess I should also mention that not all of them are these kinds of issues, there&#x27;s also lots of stuff, like in any tracker, that got fixed somewhere, but the issue was never closed.

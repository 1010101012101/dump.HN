3230984,comment,3230750,3230939,7,0,unalone,,,"I think this is an example of limited perspective. I spent two recent summers working with kids ages 9-17 and was delighted at their curiosity, brightness, and willingness to get involved in elaborate conversations. Granted, the older kids were also trying to get in each others' pants, but that's the fun of being a kid, right?<p>I don't mind the social networking junk too much either; it's detrimental in the short term but everybody I know is getting weary of how pointless it is. I've been reading A. S. Neill's fantastic <i>Summerhill School</i>, where he details the things he learned after 50 years of teaching children, and he argues that letting children play is essential to their growing up properly. Freedom to play eventually leads to kids deciding what they most enjoy doing, and it leads to them being more willing to work within their society. Since reading that, I've wondered if social networks aren't just our modern form of play: useless wastes of time objectively, but people will move on from them and find better things to do.<p>(I hope. Facebook/the status feed are still only half a decade old. If five more years pass and everybody's still just as hooked, we've got a problem; I think we'll see feed obsession subside, but I could very well be wrong.)",1321199858

3230923,comment,3230233,3230233,1,0,antirez,,,"This is not enough, if I would do that only on vacations my productivity would be a small percentage of what it is currently, since email is too much work to provide a decent reply most of the time.<p>There are many reasons why writing emails is easy but replying is hard. The first is probably that an email that requires a short processing time from the point of view of the reader (read, understand, and possibly reply) must be written very well. Not everybody is good at it, but everybody will send you an email for the most unimportant reason.<p>So in this moment my inbox contains 5700 unread emails. Not everything is a message directly addressed to me, a few are related to mailing lists, a few about notifications of different types. But there is definitely a percentage of real emails that would require a reply in that list.<p>So how I deal with this? Using the most brutal of the systems, as brutal is the email problem itself IMHO.<p>I consider my gmail account as a stream, like twitter. I use the gmail priority inbox to do a first filtering, taking the same account without priority inbox in the iPhone (so that when I read emails with the iPhone there is some chance that I read messages from the 'unimportant' pool).<p>I also set gmail to show as much emails as possible in a single page. So this is what happens: every email has a time to live this way, from the moment it appears in my inbox, to the moment it shifts away because too many new messages arrived in the meantime.<p>I reply to conversations in a most-urgent-processed-first fashion. All the emails shifting before they get a chance to be processed are lost from my point of view.<p>This allows me to set a max cap to the amount of work I've to do for emails. This will make people not happy about you from time to time, but are you ready to trade your work, what you think is important, just to reply to messages that many times are not important enough to be sent in the first instance?",1321198268

It borrows syntax from JavaScript, but not the rules of the language itself. Just like JavaScript borrows syntax from C, and OpenCL borrows from C.<p>- There are many things in Javascript we don't support. Some things we don't currently support (eg. in-line initialization of arrays) but will probably support in the future; other things we probably won't support (eg. regular expressions as language objects) and finally there are things we will never support (ie. closures).<p>- There are nice features of KL that Javascript does not have, for instance arithmetic operator overloading. These features are included because they are particularly useful for computational problems.<p>- KL is not JavaScript++ - It's designed for writing high-performance operator code, not to handle everything that JavaScript can do. We don't want to reinvent the wheel :)<p>We will work on a post to cover KL in more detail, including roadmap.

Maybe some day I will, although it currently isn't in my pants. Here's what I'd do:<p>- I'd want to take a long-term approach, and keep in touch with the people that I worked to place. After 2-3 years, they might just be up for a new position.<p>- I should know their skills deeply. Forget reading resumes, I'd read Github accounts. I should be able to read what skills they have, not be told them. Obviously not everything a person does ends up on Github, but the things they most enjoy and are best at often do. If a person enjoys working in Ruby, I'm not going to try to shoehorn them into a PHP position because they won't be happy and won't output the best.<p>- I'd want to deeply understand the actual needs of the placed position. So many Craigslist job postings that are by recruiters clearly don't understand the requirements of the job vs things that are nice to have.<p>- I also understand tech deeply. I don't be that poorly qualified recruiter who mistakes C# for CSS. I'd be able to talk about what testing frameworks people are using, or how they like to approach a problem in a non-confrontational way.<p>- While this might sound like marketing-spin, I would want to really think of it as just connecting friends who need jobs to companies of friends who are hiring. I actually do this now a good bit, since I know a lot of qualified tech people and send them emails when I get them about positions that really seem to speak to them. I never ask for money currently, because well... its just helping out friends and I want to see them happy.",1321197382

Go back and change one of your axes such that they break apart (you don't necessarily need to change the ideas).<p>So now that you have your fast/cheap/good axis set or your makes toast/slices bread/gets you a drink automatically axis (to illustrate the point that this could be anything and applied to any set of solutions), and your ideas are sufficiently spread out, go show the people all 3 ideas. Tell them all 3 ideas then ask for feedback on any of them.  You'll have 3 categories of feedback: love it, hate it, neutral.  You want 1 or 2 because that means you've elicited a response which you can use to further your iteration. By giving them 3 solutions they can now evaluate your [great idea] in context with other things that can also solve their problem. They'll generally give you better feedback than ""I'd use it"" because they'll tell you ""I wish #1 could be more like #3 in this way.""",1321196703

Even if nobody believes that BS, some wealthy people will pay more for something just because the knowledge that most people can't afford it makes them feel more exclusive.",1321196687

Too often I've seen coworkers who become ""the guy who helps"". The guy doesn't say no, who answers questions that have nothing to do with their job. I like to be helpful but I don't want to be the one who fixes everyone else's problems to the detriment of getting my own work done. It's easier to say ""you should ask Joe, he's in charge of that process"" in an email, for me anyways.",1321196666

I mean even countries that really cannot be considered laissez-faire capitalistic like Sweden (14), Germany (19), France (29) are doing much better. Even the former eastern european states, that started at a much lower level have better rankings...<p>So I wouldn't say that the aim is some ""germanization"" of Europe, but that the reforms in Italy+Greece are just clearly necessary.<p>Since Italy+Greece joined the Euro, they had the cheapest access to credit ever and it didn't help them at all. Maybe the harsh reforms and austerity now isn't optimal either because it is killing the economy, but it seems it is the only thing that can work.",1321196612

Ives gets a lot of credit for being a great designer and being the one who helped SJ realize his computing vision.  Given SJs OCD about details I don't think it was ever a case where he was playing golf, took an Ives design and just pushed it out as his own.",1321196460

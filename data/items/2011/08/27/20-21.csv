With writing we are also limited by our fingers but reading can go much faster if one learns to get rid of the inner voice (speed reading).<p>And even though I agree with you that touch-typing isn't that much of a limiting factor when compared to the time required to come up with something sensible but unfortunately, at least for me, those deep analytical and creative thoughts doesn't produce a steady stream of characters but rather bursts of sentences and paragraphs and taking the time to writing them out obstructs the thought process (depending on what I'm doing (most of what I do isn't that challenging)). So I'd say that the speed improvements of touch-typing compared to handwriting can be quite useful (and being able to get rid of it entirely by taking 'snapshots' of a current thought process, continue, and then later go back and summarize and formulate all snapshots would be awesome).",1314478213

The author fails to understand that words are used with different meanings in English and law.<p>For example, if you came home from work and found that your house had been cleaned out by thieves, you might say ""I've been robbed!"". If you did so in the presence of the author, would he correct you, pointing out that you were in fact burglarized, not robbed? Probably not--in normal conversational English people will use robbed more expansively than it is used in the law.<p>In common usage, people use ""theft"" and related terms like ""stole"" to mean the exercise of a right that should belong to someone else, with everything interpreted expansively.<p>For instance, we might speak of someone ""stealing"" another person's girlfriend. Obviously, he did not legally steal her, but there are social norms concerning what is acceptable behavior in relationships and toward people in relationships, and so if someone violates those norms in order to effect a retargeting of the girls affections, we'll say she was stolen.<p>Even farther afield, we have things like actors who steal the show, players who steal the game, and so on.<p>Getting back to copyright infringement, copyright law is purposefully modeled on the law of physical property, in order to artificially give intellectual goods legal status similar to that of physical goods, so that the same kind of markets that work for physical goods can be used for intellectual goods.<p>It essentially creates a homomorphism from the world of intellectual goods to the world of physical goods.

2932378,comment,2932018,2932018,21,0,tptacek,,,"Contrary to the lede of this article, it's not impossible to merely <i>question</i> Vixie's credibility here.<p>First, this is the same Paul Vixie who proposed and advocated for RPZ. RPZ is a distributed blacklisting scheme for the DNS. Unlike the the email spam RBL, RPZ works at the level of DNS, allowing ""policy"" to determine which lookups fail. So it seems that DNS filtering doesn't break the Internet when it's used to combat malware, but does break the Internet when it's used suppress piracy.<p>Second, however urgent the authors of this document want to make DNSSEC sound, the <i>entire Internet</i> functions without DNSSEC today. I can go on and on about how broken I think DNSSEC is, but I don't think I need to bother, because there's an even stronger argument as to how unnecessary it is. Put simply, the ""secure Internet"" was designed to assume that the DNS was untrustworthy. We built an entire parallel directory alongside the DNS to resolve that. To a large extent, that secure directory (the X509 SSL/TLS PKI) works whether or not the DNS is unsafe. To the extent that the DNS threatens TLS, those are fixable flaws in the TLS infrastructure (and many of those flaws are policy issues in TLS, and the majority of the balance of those flaws are UX issues stemming from the fact that we haven't refined the UI for TLS since it was introduced by Netscape).<p>Breaking DNSSEC <i>does not</i> break the Internet. Proof: go do a Google search for your bank, click through it, log in, and check your balance. Let me know if any DNSSEC happens along the way.<p>Tying this back to Paul Vixie: Vixie is the Internet's foremost advocate for DNSSEC. It's unfair but not <i>totally</i> unreasonable to suggest that Vixie resisted the randomization fixes to BIND that Djbdns adopted because he preferred DNSSEC as the solution to that problem; as a result, BIND's DNS cache was vulnerable for almost a decade while Djbdns wasn't.<p>Next, as smart as Danny McPhereson may be, I think it's far from proven that DNSSEC can't coexist with fiat third-party filtering. In the DNSSEC implementation originally envisaged by the working group's current iteration of the protocol, end systems don't even run DNSSEC; they run stub resolvers that talk to cache servers that run the whole protocol. Those cache servers could have lookaside rules for a policy zone without breaking the security model for DNSSEC.<p>Finally, because the reality is that virtually nobody speaks DNSSEC today, it may suffice for PROTECT IP's goals to filter only insecure DNS. The sponsors of PROTECT IP could just easily say, ""uh, of course we don't mean DNSSEC is illegal; we'll deal with DNSSEC another day, but for now, we're suppressing websites, not trying to destroy them, and we're content to have our intervention only impact DNS users"".<p>I'm not a believer in PROTECT IP, I just think this argument is fragile.<p>For whatever it's worth, I think all 5 of the authors of this report are advocating in good faith what they think is best for the Internet. And I do buy the argument that fiat third-party filtering is bad for the Internet. I just don't think ""it breaks DNSSEC"" is the most compelling or intellectually honest argument. I think the honest argument is, ""because we don't think any one authority will be an adequate steward of the Internet"".<p> <i>I'm choosing my words carefully; the</i> answer <i>to the question might still be ""he's totally credible"".</i><p> <i>Again this is a drastically unfair summary of an issue that could possibly reworded in a way that would refute my point, which is that Vixie's going to tend to err on the side of whatever makes DNSSEC easier to deploy.</i>",1314476833

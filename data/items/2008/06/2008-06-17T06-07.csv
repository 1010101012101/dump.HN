FLOSS expertise is concentrated in people who use software independently before they use it organizationally.<p>This is not intended as a sexist post or a comment on differences in capabilities between genders. I've seen capable women who find it harder to get employment than their male peers, and think there are sexist pressures in the workforce that make it a lot harder for women to work as independent consultants. So I know a lot less who worry about Hadoop.",1213685993

Pay the default .05 cents per CPM and you will be paying .05 to .25cents a day to reach all of those people.  Finding the right sites is a bit of a challenge but you only have to find a few sites and stick with those to drive new traffic to your site every day.",1213685518

This is exactly the type of game I loved as a kid.<p>It must feel good to have your game to such a good spot and just have to tweak it and add cool bosses and a few more mechanics like level editors or retro zelda levels.  Already a great flash game and also a lot of room to grow with a bit more work.  I wish I could play it full screen.<p>I will buy it, but not tonight.

I would imagine it took considerable imagination for Einstein to develop the theory of relativity, or for Bach to write the St. Matthew Passion, but neither did so without referring to a lot of structure and knowledge that they already had.<p>""Quadrupillion"" implies four of something, when actually it's a googolplex plus a hundred (This actually <i>is</i> a pretty damn useless number unless the number (googolplex+100) turned out to be very important to some particular idea or occurrence, but that's less important to my point). It would be better to tell the child this, and explain about the quad- prefix, and suggest a better name for his number. As for its uselessness, I imagine that this will become apparent to him quite quickly, so that doesn't matter so much in terms of what to explain to the child.",1213683949

Accumulate was something simple like pressedKeys |= pressedKey<p>- updateScreen() is usually just a call to repaint() or something like that, which makes the Operating System call your applications paint() method. My paint method looks like<p>paint(Graphics g){<p>drawBackground(g);<p>drawCounters(g);<p>drawMonsters(g);<p>drawPlayer(g);<p>}<p>and so on...

The number of particles in the visible universe is only on the order of 10^80.<p>Of course there are some examples. There's a quadrupillion ways to organize N balls into M separate piles (for some values of N and M which I'm too lazy to figure out now). There's a quadrupillion possible English sentences of less than M' words.<p>A six-year-old, even a clever one, doesn't really have the capabilities to understand these kinds of scales though. In fact, you can see from the fact that he chose ""a hundred"" as a big number which could be added to a googolplex that he's still at the age where he thinks ""a hundred"" is a huge number.

219490,comment,219303,219346,0,0,hugh,,,"Agreed. I suppose the important thing is to give praise in the right way. I think ideally praise should be phrased in such a way that gives them some gratification for doing what they've done, while challenging them to see if they can do something more.<p>In this case, the kid has exercised enough creativity to realise that he can make up his own numbers, but not enough critical thinking to realise that the space of large numbers is huge enough that not every number should have a special name. Ideally, you'd want to use this as an opportunity to challenge the kid to see if he can work this out for himself. Ask him what other numbers he can think of, like a googolplex plus a thousand, or a googolplex minus one hundred, and see if he can figure out that there are far more numbers than there could possibly be catchy names for. Since the ""interestingness"" of that particular large number is apparent only in base ten, you could even use this as an opportunity to introduce him to other bases (or better still, to see if he can surmise their existence for himself).",1213682535

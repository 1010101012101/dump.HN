3201895,comment,3201033,3201033,34,0,nikcub,,,"Before your jump into your code, grep it and change every instance of [:] into list or copy know that it isn't that easy. Most Python projects will use all four common variations of copying a list or object. Here they are with benchmark times[1]:<p><pre><code>    b = a[:]           0.039ms\n    b = list(a)        0.085ms\n    b = copy(a)        0.187ms\n    b = deepcopy(a)   10.592ms \n</code></pre>\nFirst method for short lists, eg. function or system args, where you know you have a list. The Python manual suggests this method when copying a sequence as the fastest/best method[2]<p>The type constructor list will convert any sequence into a list and will preserve order. If you pass it a list, all it does is return the sequence using the slice operator anyway[3]. It is slower because of the type checking, but it is implemented in C. So you can think of list() as just [:] with a type cast - no need to call it again if you know you have a list.<p>copy and deepcopy are implemented in python, and are generic functions that attempt to sniff the type of the object to be copied. They will use the __copy__ magic[4] of the object if it exists, so you can override it in your objects with return self[:]. You need to use these if you have a generator, a list of non-basic types (such as lists of lists, or lists of tuples, or lists of objects). Both functions use a module-level cache and deepcopy will iterate and apply copy<p>there is very little performance degradation by aliasing copy to deepcopy and using it everywhere, although it could save you time by catching bugs. (Edit: scratch that, I got my benchmark wrong - deepcopy will still be slow even if you pass it a shallow list, see comment below, thanks tedunangst)<p>Read the source of copy and deepcopy so you can understand them and can implement your own custom version for more advanced types. Find the file:<p><pre><code>    >>> import copy\n    >>> copy.__file__\n    /usr/local/python/2.6/lib/copy.pyc\n</code></pre>\nEach of these methods has its own use case, if you grep through a well implemented project such as Werkzeug[5] you can find how each is used efficiently. For eg. [:] is used when you know you have a list, such as template variables. list() is used to force into a list, eg. before these vars get to other objects and copy() is used on custom data types, making a copy of environ (which can contain almost anything) and in copying the routing table (which can not be trusted to be a list).<p>[1] Benchmark times taken from: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2612802/how-to-clone-a-list-in-python/2612990#2612990"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2612802/how-to-clone-a-li...</a> which I had bookmarked as a reference<p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.python.org/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-copy-an-object-in-python"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-copy-an...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://docs.python.org/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-convert-between-tuples-and-lists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-convert...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus7/html/page85.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus7/html/page85.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug</a>",1320555441

A byte-per-pixel framebuffer memory layout makes easy what would be a thorough pain on the Amiga<p>That's simply not true.<p>Take e.g. Doom II from your list; In order to have double buffering (required for smooth screen update), it had to use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_X</a> which is .. a planar mode even if it is 1-byte per pixel (in a slightly nicer way than the Amiga's planar mode; but switching planes cost an arm and a leg in I/O communication, so to actually work efficiently with it, it was as bad as the Amiga's planar mode).<p>> If you have raw CPU power, that fixes everything. You don't need a blitter, and you don't need sprites, and you don't need playfields, and you can do your sound mixing on the CPU.<p>I remember one (1) reasonable multi-level parallax scrolling game for the PC with reasonable performance, but not its name. (I remember it well, because I spent a few afternoons with a debugger trying to figure out how the f*ck they managed). CPU was NOT enough to not need all of these.<p>Almost all the games you mentioned have a 3D point of view (those that I'm familiar with, anyway) - for which the Amiga's '85 2D acceleration wasn't helpful, of course. But the 2D games of the PC, especially scrollers, were inferior.<p>Non of them, as far as I can tell, had 3d sound or multi channel stereo mixing in 1995 -- PC mod players back then were struggling to go below 30% CPU (I know, I wrote one of the fastest ones), and no game could afford them.<p>I released a sideways scroller for the PC in '94, that achieved constant 60fps (with not a lot of CPU to spare) on the 486DX of the time, and a respectable 30fps on the 386 that were still super common. To get that, I needed to use ModeX, used Adlib for music so I can use DMA sample playing for the effects (also, pure adlib was _still_ common enough to warrant support if you didn't have a soundblaster). It needed an awful lot of tricks to get reasonable performance; The graphics engine was all assembly, and some of the game logic too. And I needed continuously recalibrating the int8 timer to get interrupts at the vertical retrace so that everything worked properly without wasting CPU.<p>I never got to do an Amiga version, but it would have been 100 times simpler. And would have worked equally well on an 1985 Amiga 1000.",1320553819

Partly because of the inhibition-lowering effects of the Internet, partly because of the greater communication and market-making opportunities enabled by the Internet, and partly because of the increased economic pressure put on otherwise working class people caused by globalization, and again, by the Internet. In short, a greater percentage of people will choose to, or perhaps feel are forced to, engage in sexual acts in exchange for money. Even if just ""webcam entertainment"". I'm betting it will happen anyway.",1320552799

As an avid porn user, I've been telling one of my friend who's in the business of recommendation engine to ""pornify his  business"" for profit.<p>So much talent, data-mining has been spent on the problem of recommending what product you should also look at Amazon.com from the page you on, what Netflix film you should queue up next and what song you should listen to next according to the 512 acoustic attributes of the current one. Forgot all that, I want the next best clip to watch based on - one of the most frequently pursued and unacknowledged male (and female) activity on the Internet.<p>Data is all there. Tagging is categorized to the T on porntube sites by the actor/actress, genre, ethnicity and different acts depicted. Aggregator sites are already out there so all someone needs to do is build an aggregator site that plots out the user ""interaction"" graph from one clip to the next and make correlations. Next a snazzy Pandora interface where you could skip (unlimited times) to the next video, or show multiple preview of video's that you could skip to; or maybe make it social like turntable.fm where multiple people could vote to rock their socks off to a clip or not and see how long people in a particular room last... the possibilities are endless in pornification of the interwebz",1320552529

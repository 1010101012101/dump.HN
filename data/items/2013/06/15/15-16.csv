I am sure that the NSA takes more concern over privacy than, say, Google or Yahoo. But that&#x27;s not really relevant here is it?

I opened up PyCharm and it looked good too.<p>It had been a while with a lot of updates to Fedora including KDE, Java and so on. So I don&#x27;t know where the problem got resolved but it seems pretty good now.<p>I think it is worth noting - I never had a problem on my 32 bit system running the same OS and what not. This was also an issue for all my swing apps on that machine - not just the JetBrains stuff.",1371308992

In fact even with the default background and no album artwork it is unacceptably difficult (in my opinion) with the text being white, with no shadow or outline and such a thin typeface.<p>I do assume that the album artwork will be repositioned or some other measures will be taken before release though, given how egregious the issues are (specifically regarding the album artwork). I&#x27;m less hopeful that they&#x27;ll add a layer between the text and background as in the old version, or just a text shadow or outline, but that is what they ought to do.",1371308634

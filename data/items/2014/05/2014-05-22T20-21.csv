7786486,comment,7785681,7786399,3,0,MBCook,,,"Insulting iOS users is not a productive way to start a discussion.<p>1) It&#x27;s fair to let people choose a different app (I know many people really want this on iOS), but I think his complaint is valid. There are many situations where it&#x27;s completely unclear to a new user why they should use app X over Y for photo management/SMS/etc. To ask them before they&#x27;ve even used the app the first time nearly ensures they&#x27;re not ready to make that decision. Sensible defaults and perhaps delaying the prompting until the device notices the user uses an alternate app a couple of times may be a better way to handle this.<p>3) Why should it matter if my HTC One came from a T-Mobile store or not? The fact that they behave differently (and especially that T-Mobile&#x27;s support isn&#x27;t prepared for that) is clearly an issue. I think the voicemail note is telling. How many people, upon buying a new phone, would think &quot;I need to go download a special app to get my voicemail working&quot;?<p>4) HTC took something that worked fine and made it more confusing. That&#x27;s clearly a design mistake.<p>5) If something doesn&#x27;t work reliably, that&#x27;s a design issue.

(If you are a UI designer at least shed some light on what is the way to do a better UX on this feature - simply saying you don&#x27;t know which one to pick is not really adding any value. You have to try Hangouts, Gallery, Photos and then choose them as &quot;Always&quot; - that&#x27;s the idea and I find it as intuitive as it can be.)<p>2) Hardware differentiation - yeah just install a launcher once and be done with it - oh you will have to choose the default once after you install it, but yeah after that it&#x27;s even easier. Oh and Google autocompletes HTC disable blinkfeed - first result tells you how in two steps.<p>3) Fine print of an unlocked Android phone - he is troubled because WiFi calling isn&#x27;t available on _all_ Android phones whether or not the carrier is T-Mobile - and if it was there he would be sure to complain about what&#x27;s that WiFi calling thing that I don&#x27;t understand on my Verizon HTC One.

Stock Android and even Samsung phones just swipe and unlock - plus you can thank slide to unlock patent for some of the differentiation there.<p>5) Back button - as much as inconsistent it is, having it still beats not having it altogether. But yes it can be a little annoying at times.<p>6) Navigation bar - he complains about there being differences in Samsung and HTC phones! I can&#x27;t figure out why that is relevant as his target audience generally will stick to one phone.<p>7) He even complains about the Notification  bar! (For crying out loud everyone pretty much copies this from Android - including iOS!) &quot;I clear my notifications periodically, but inevitably a pile of tiny incomprehensible turds appear at the top of my screen, uglifying it to no end.&quot; Ugh, what?

Changing how that code executes on my computer doesn&#x27;t change the website for the owner or for others visiting the site. Having a physical presence in someone&#x27;s home arguably causes physical changes in the world for the owner of the house and for others visiting. It&#x27;s not a useful analogy for this argument, to my mind.<p>I do like the television analogy, though. Presumably you&#x27;d argue that I shouldn&#x27;t be permitted to mute the audio, change the channel, or skip ahead or back in the video stream when the &quot;owner&quot; of the video being displayed says I shouldn&#x27;t. Does that &quot;owner&quot; have some kind of moral right in how I &quot;consume&quot; their content? Sounds like an argument for the &quot;broadcast flag&quot; and even more draconian restrictions to make the television that I paid for and own &quot;belong&quot; to someone else. Yikes! I wouldn&#x27;t want to &quot;consume&quot; that content or buy a television that had that kind of functionality in it. (I&#x27;m already frustrated enough at DVDs with &quot;unskippable&quot; material that, effectively, punish me for using a legally-licensed media in a legally-licensed player.)<p>Arguing that I shouldn&#x27;t be permitted to alter how a website displays on my computer is, effectively, arguing that I don&#x27;t actually own my computer when a third-party says that I don&#x27;t. &quot;In consideration for viewing our website you agree that you don&#x27;t own your computer.&quot; I definitely wouldn&#x27;t visit that website. Nobody says that kind of thing out right, though. Website operators just require silly things like DRM-plugins (Silverlight for Netflix, for example) that erode my control of my owner computer.

The assumption that women are naturally better caregivers is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not like commercials in which bumbling dads mess up the laundry and competent wives have to bustle in and fix it. The assumption that women are naturally better housekeepers is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not want you to have to make alimony payments. Alimony is set up to combat the fact that women have been historically expected to prioritize domestic duties over professional goals, thus minimizing their earning potential if their &quot;traditional&quot; marriages end. The assumption that wives should make babies instead of money is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not want anyone to get raped in prison. Permissiveness and jokes about prison rape are part of rape culture, which is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not want anyone to be falsely accused of rape. False rape accusations discredit rape victims, which reinforces rape culture, which is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not want you to be lonely and we do not hate &quot;nice guys.&quot; The idea that certain people are inherently more valuable than other people because of superficial physical attributes is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not want you to have to pay for dinner. We want the opportunity to achieve financial success on par with men in any field we choose (and are qualified for), and the fact that we currently don&#x27;t is part of patriarchy. The idea that men should coddle and provide for women, and/or purchase their affections in romantic contexts, is condescending and damaging and part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not want you to be maimed or killed in industrial accidents, or toil in coal mines while we do cushy secretarial work and various yarn-themed activities. The fact that women have long been shut out of dangerous industrial jobs (by men, by the way) is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not want you to commit suicide. Any pressures and expectations that lower the quality of life of any gender are part of patriarchy. The fact that depression is characterized as an effeminate weakness, making men less likely to seek treatment, is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not want you to be viewed with suspicion when you take your child to the park (men frequently insist that this is a serious issue, so I will take them at their word). The assumption that men are insatiable sexual animals, combined with the idea that it&#x27;s unnatural for men to care for children, is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not want you to be drafted and then die in a war while we stay home and iron stuff. The idea that women are too weak to fight or too delicate to function in a military setting is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists do not want women to escape prosecution on legitimate domestic violence charges, nor do we want men to be ridiculed for being raped or abused. The idea that women are naturally gentle and compliant and that victimhood is inherently feminine is part of patriarchy.<p>Feminists hate patriarchy. We do not hate you.</i>",1400791304

The trend towards smaller numbers of more sophisticated aircraft exacerbates it. For a random example, the marginal cost of building a new F-22 (if they were still being built at all) is about $150 million, but if you just take the program cost and divide it by the relatively small number (under 200) built, you get about $350 million apiece.

Start doing little projects that are personally relevant to you. These can be anything: little math problems from projecteuler, data analysis problems, technical interview questions.

In the <i>context</i> of certain feminisms, the words refer to people born male or female, and then raised into the gender roles defined by society as appropriate for male and female people. These gender roles are what are invoked by words like &quot;manly&quot;, &quot;womanly&quot;, &quot;sissy&quot;, and other &quot;gendered&quot; words and insults.<p>In other feminisms, the words refer to people who &quot;identify&quot; as one or the other, where this identity is either &quot;innate&quot; or otherwise fluid or something. Full disclosure, I sympathize with the former sort of feminism, so I&#x27;m not exactly the best person to give a comprehensive synopsis here.<p>Judith Lorber&#x27;s &quot;Gender Inequality&quot; is a book that goes over individual feminist movements and waves, without necessarily pushing any of them on the reader.

To a certain extent, shampooing less can be great for your hair, for a lot of the reasons discussed in the article about skin care.

Additionally, once you get your scalp accustomed to less frequent shampooing and it stops producing tons of oil to compensate, life for your hair can be pretty good.<p>That said, I can never seem to get onto a cycle of more than just a couple days without shampooing before my hair is just too oily.

Also I&#x27;ve called a cab on at least 3 occasions and they never showed up and I had to call again. Every cab I have ever taken only accepts cash which I rarely have on me and getting change back is awkward and so I normally end up overpaying so I don&#x27;t have to deal with it.<p>I have been patiently waiting for Uber/Lyft to come to Lexington and about a month ago Lyft came. I was ecstatic and signed up right away and a few days later had my first Lyft ride. It was the most refreshing ride I have ever had. Not only did I not have to worry about the driver not showing up but I knew what car he was driving and had his picture on my phone and so it was very easy for me to spot him. The drivers have all been very nice and their cars have been clean and took me straight to my destination without me having to give directions unlike the dirty cabs I&#x27;ve ridden in with drivers that barley speak English and don&#x27;t use GPS.<p>I will never use a taxi again if I can help it, Lyft has provided me with an amazing alternative and I would gladly pay double for a Lyft driver because the experience is so much better than a taxi.<p>YMMV.",1400789190

Landsea was the relevant expert on the subject and even he couldn&#x27;t stop the fear-mongering; he quit because he didn&#x27;t want to be associated with it. The issue he quit over was that there really <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> an &quot;accelerating rate of catastrophic weather incidents&quot; to the degree the IPCC was trying to claim at the time.<p>On good things we can expect: The main measurable good thing we can expect from the next 1-3 degrees of warming is increased agricultural productivity. In the northern areas where most of the world&#x27;s food is grown, warmer average temperatures means a longer growing season which makes it easier to feed the world. (It also increases the range where we can grow crops and makes winters less bitterly cold in places like Canada.) Closer to the equator the warming part doesn&#x27;t help so much but the extra CO2 makes forestry more productive - it helps trees grow better due to CO2 fertilization.\n(My main source on this is the AR4 IPCC report - I haven&#x27;t read AR5 yet.)<p>Also: many more humans die each year from excessive cold than from excessive heat; a planet with less bitterly cold winters is a more habitable one.<p>Also: being warmer puts us a little further away from the next ice age. Climate <i>always</i> changes; given the choice, I&#x27;d rather it get a little warmer than a little colder. (There is no reason to think the temperature in, say, 1990 was optimum for human life worldwide. We don&#x27;t need to return to that, nor do we need to keep it where it is now.)<p>With regard just to <i>sea</i> ice it&#x27;s not &quot;oscillating between extremes&quot; so much as there&#x27;s been a shift over time as to where more sea ice collects on the planet - more in the south, less in the north. Changing sea currents and weather patterns can do that over long cycles. When alarmists look at growing sea ice in the south they dismiss it with &quot;oh, the currents have changed&quot; or &quot;oh, the weather patterns have changed&quot; or &quot;yeah, but ignore that and look at the LAND instead!&quot; but when they look at shrinking sea ice in the north they tend to insist it&#x27;s due to warming and only that; I&#x27;d like to see a little more consistency.<p>SkepticalScience is not a reliable source - it&#x27;s a propagandistic site run by a cartoonist, not a scientist - but in this case that&#x27;s not a factor: argument 25 at that link is about sea level rise. Since I agree that sea levels have (very slowly) been rising over time, I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s relevant. (FWIW, I also agree that measured temperatures increased in the last half of the last century and that CO2 is a greenhouse gas and that some recent warming has been the result of human activity.)<p>> <i>HN is the last place I would expect to find myself fighting against climate change skeptics</i><p>The article you wrote suggested in passing that the planet could become uninhabitable in mere <i>decades</i> because we&#x27;ve passed a bunch of &quot;tipping points&quot; - you&#x27;re bound to get some pushback if you try to make wild-eyed claims of that sort.

I never want to feel like I&#x27;m giving time to somebody trying to extract some psychological harm as revenge on my gender - whether or not they have a reason to be angry with the status quo, the target market often doesn&#x27;t last long enough to receive your message.<p>This is true, yet such a delicate matter. Allow me to digress from the primary issue at hand to share an anecdote.<p>When I first read about the &quot;check your privilege&quot; controversy at my alma mater [1], my reaction was &quot;we definitely have acute class issues, but by opening in such a confrontational way, we&#x27;re taking away any possibility of having a constructive dialogue.&quot; Delivery so profoundly affects how we respond to the raising of an issue, and can be the difference between an instinctive defensiveness or a considered opening of the psychological gates.<p>The letter to the editor to the NYT piece puts it well:<p><i>&quot;Most disturbing about the “check your privilege” comment to people making arguments at Princeton University is its utility in changing the subject away from their ideas, conservative or liberal. This kind of dismissive labeling needs to be called out for the ad hominem attack that it is. Recognizing it for what it is could undermine what it does, which is to sabotage debate.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s a delicate line to walk -- being assertive and resolute, yet communicating understanding and cooperation. But if our goal is actual, gradual change for the better, rather than simply feeling good about ourselves for putting someone down or taking the pulpit for ourselves, then I feel that the means we choose must not fail to encourage our intended audience from lending us their ear.<p>It is so hard though, since each person&#x27;s interpretation of language differs in so many subtle ways. We can see it in this very thread, where the same given post is interpreted in a wide range of intent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/nyregion/at-princeton-privilege-is-a-commonplace-b-misunderstood-or-c-frowned-upon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/nyregion/at-princeton-priv...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/opinion/a-hot-topic-at-princeton-check-your-privilege.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/opinion/a-hot-topic-at-pri...</a>",1400788855

You can always break your lease but there&#x27;s a financial penalty of some form for that.<p>In most cases you can only sell your house if someone is willing to buy it.

What word should the parent commenter have used? &quot;man gender&quot; is not grammatical, so I can only think of one other option; &quot;male&quot;.<p>(edit: and in case I&#x27;m misunderstood, I don&#x27;t mean any kind of subtext on the wider debate here, I&#x27;m just asking because I think &#x27;male&#x27; is a gender and am confused).<p>(edit: right, found this: <a href=""http://www.med.monash.edu.au/gendermed/sexandgender.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.med.monash.edu.au/gendermed/sexandgender.html</a> so basically it&#x27;s the difference between sex and gender. I wasn&#x27;t acutely aware that the words male vs masculine carried such an important distinction. I&#x27;m not sure if they are commonly used in that distinct way).",1400788837

7786090,comment,7783556,7783556,2,0,NameNickHN,,,"Ahh, the good old days. In 1997/98 I created a website for my hometown with photos, cinema schedule and the like. I &quot;designed&quot; it Coral Draw und Adobe GoLive. It was a time when you were hip if you used tables for the layout. And if you used Server Side Includes, you were quite the hacker.<p>My first real web development project was an appointment scheduler. In 2000 a potential client wanted one but we couldn&#x27;t license one from the only company that offered that kind of software at the time in Germany. Thus I taught myself PHP and MySQL and within a week I had a working prototype. Users could reserve appointments and admins could manage them.<p>The deal with the potential client fell through, though, but I continued working on the code. It was hard going because back in the day, there were no PHP frameworks (that I knew of) and no CSS frameworks.<p>It&#x27;s been moderately successful and I still have happy customers from that time. I only wish I had done early on what I did two years ago: offer it as a hosted service (or SaaS, as it is now called).",1400788800

8386685,comment,8384601,8384601,5,0,lawtguy,,,"I think this points out that the problem is we keep treating our children like adults.  We&#x27;ve pushed to make them learn skills earlier to the point that kindergarden is now essentially first grade [0].  Additionally schools are cutting back on PE to be able to cram more education in [1].<p>The result I believe is that normal childhood development of self-regulation begins to look pathological and becomes diagnosed as ADHD.  At the same time we&#x27;ve been demanding more at younger ages, ADHD diagnosis have greatly increased [2].  Additionally, roughly two-thirds of these kids won&#x27;t have ADHD by the time they become an adult [3].  I think this points to the fact that we&#x27;re simply expecting too much academically too early and we&#x27;re compounding this by taking away the physical play that would help them develop.<p>We need to reset kindergarden back to where it was so that most kids have a chance to properly develop.  We also need to restore the idea that children are suppose to play, that it&#x27;s good for them and not a waste of time.<p>P.S: For that other 30%, ADHD is real and drugs may be entirely appropriate.  I&#x27;d also suspect that more play and pushing learning later will help them as well.<p>P.P.S: We also need to find a way for the kids that do have the self-regulation to learn more advanced material.  Right now schools do a terrible job of dealing with the kids on either end of the bell curve of learning skills.<p>P.P.P.S: Boys appear to lag girls by almost year in terms of their self-regulation [4].  I suspect that is why boys are far more diagnosed with ADHD.  In any case, I believe this is hurting both boys and girls, it&#x27;s just more apparent in boys.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/what-happened-kindergarten"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/what-happened-kin...</a>\n[1]: <a href=""http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/education/many-schools-cutting-back-physical-education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/education/many-schools-cut...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/11/25/adhd-diagnosis-treatment-on-the-rise-in-u-s/62500.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/11/25/adhd-diagnosis-treat...</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-adhd-causes-problems-into-adulthood-030413"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-adhd-causes-pro...</a>\n[4]: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/09/why-girls-get-better-grades-than-boys-do/380318/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/09/why-gir...</a>",1412048746

The likelihood of the a) case occurring is lower by virtue of accessibility.<p>With the source code and the development history of the product in the open, we can at least see whether a misbehavior was intentional, or exploited logic questionable, and that there might have been a mistake in the original thinking. How easily would one have come to those conclusions if the source was not private?

If you are in demand (i.e., frequently turning down overtures from recruiters) and/or you&#x27;re very confident that if you lost your job tomorrow that you could find another equally good job in a matter of a couple weeks or less, then going out on your own for awhile probably won&#x27;t have any negative impact.<p>On the other hand, if the above does <i>not</i> describe your current career situation, then I&#x27;d think hard about it.

Primary means the pressure is high enough that it literally shoots out of the ground. That&#x27;s pretty easy oil. Secondary means employing a mechanism -- like a pump -- to get it out of the ground. We&#x27;re just now beginning to toy with new tertiary methods of extraction, and they are expensive. Yes, innovation marches on. However, we probably won&#x27;t innovate planet-scale hydrocarbon supplies out of thin air in the next twenty five years. The price will keep getting higher, the methods more and more creative, but at some point, capitalism as a mechanism for oil extraction becomes ineffective (and eventually impossible), and the flow of oil stops.

That&#x27;s why spikes in the oil price cause recessions.[1]<p>The price of energy matters too, not just its derivative. We can make synthetic fuels that existing infrastructure can use but they&#x27;re too expensive to support our civilization.[2]<p>Imagine your robot vacuum can run an hour on a charge and takes 15min to make a roundtrip to its charging station. If you move the charging station so the roundtrip takes 30min, you&#x27;ll get dirty floors, and they&#x27;ll still be dirty a year later. The robot&#x27;s EROI has gone from 4 to 2 and it can only handle a smaller house, or one that sees less activity.<p>The EROI of a commodity like oil is approximately inversely proportional to its price. For commodities, competition brings price to the marginal cost of production, which is the cost of the embodied energy (so for fuels, this cost is unitless). The synthetic fuels are expensive because their synthesis is energy-intensive.<p>It&#x27;s something policy makers should understand when they advertise energy projects as creating jobs. Manifestly, the more jobs an energy source requires, the worse it is.

All the operator sees is a few human shaped pixels. He has to rely on other sources of intelligence to infer that the target is who he thinks he is. It&#x27;s like the state executing people by planting bombs in their offices that have simple time-delay fuses. When 4:30 pm Friday rolls around, the intended target might be in his office, or he might be out golfing.  Somebody else entirely might wind up being there and the bomb is certain to take out more than one office to boot.  Friday might even be bring your daughter to work day.",1412046431

The fact that Ross Ulbricht&#x27;s opsec was allegedly bad enough that he could be blackmailed isn&#x27;t a general fact about darknet markets.<p>2. That entire exchange is totally trumped up. This is the exchange the complaint alleges occurs:<p><i>BLACKMAILER</i>: Pay me $X. I need it to pay DEBTOR.<p><i>DPR</i>: Let me speak to DEBTOR.<p><i>DEBTOR</i>: Hello, this is DEBTOR.<p><i>DPR</i>: I will pay you $X/4 to kill <i>BLACKMAILER</i>.<p><i>DEBTOR</i>: We want $X/3.<p><i>DPR</i>: I have had men killed for $X/5, but I will pay you $X/3.<p><i>DEBTOR</i>: It&#x27;s done. Nice doing business with you.<p><i>DPR</i>: Likewise.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware, no actual murder victim has ever turned up, and none of the parties except Ross have been arrested. The exchange sounds much more like a negotiation tactic than an actual contract killing, and is much more reasonable if you read it as such.<p>But of course this is irrelevant to people who want to use it to horns-effect anything within an arms reach of the greatest project in harm reduction the world has ever seen. To put it another way, people <i>died</i> this last year, this summer, this week probably, from bad drugs. There is no reason why the modern world cannot supply these drugs safely, and darknet markets seem to do a better job than anything else.<p>But go ahead and parrot the DEA line.

For me, the early days of a social network are often very enjoyable -- lots of interesting people trying things out.  The UI&#x27;s not my favorite style and is a bit quirky but you can certainly have good conversations (at least on a computer; the mobile interface needs work).<p>As for what&#x27;s attractive about it: it&#x27;s not Facebook.  People are ready for something different.  I noticed more and more people talking about time spent on Facebook the way they talk about time watching bad TV or eating junk food ... plus, in my experience, most people really do find Facebook&#x27;s ads irritating.

The diagrams (a) and (b) on page nine of the following research paper is a crude example: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4327v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4327v1.pdf</a><p>Lindex &#x27;Enterprise SEO Software&#x27; has this to say: &quot;Our latest innovation Linkdex Networks enables you to visualise and analyse these groups of relevant influencers. The objective is to enable digital marketers to gradually identify the right personalities and build relationships with them, spreading along those networks for maximum exposure.\nIf someone within your network has lots of relationships pointing to them you know that they are perceived as trustworthy sources. The aim is to find influencers who are passionate on a niche topic, have strong relationships with the group and are receptive to new ideas with plenty of reach.&quot; [1]<p>It&#x27;s on fire everywhere in marketing and advertising and there are lots of variations being tried and tested at the moment, and also publicly funded research at universities [2]. Marketers will drop prices online when they detect influencers, in an attempt to encourage them to speak highly of their product to their friends and family (who will need to buy at full price). The Marketing Science Institute has a whole section dedicated to social networks and influencing them [3][4].<p>Just searching for the term &quot;social contagion advertising&quot; or &quot;advertising influencers&quot; reveals media research arms with nifty tables that map out ways of influencing social groups by targeting information strategically at certain members. For example you can get people to change their view of the &quot;legitimacy of an item&quot; by &quot;encourag[ing] influential targets to adopt the item&quot; or create the idea of a &quot;status disadvantage of not adopting&quot; by &quot;Emphasiz[ing] activities of close connections in a social network to influence behavior&quot;. [5]<p>Perhaps a side note, but the DoD &quot;MINERVA initiative&quot; [6] studies social contagion strategies to track, create or lessen political instability in other countries (although the initiative studies a lot of other things too). The USAID Cuban Twitter project sought to (and nearly succeeded in) creating mass unrest by appearing to be a grassroots movement on Twitter in Cuba seeking the overthrow of the government. Snowden documents and leaked HB Gary memos show that both the NSA and GCHQ engage in astroturfing and social media manipulation [7][8][9]. The giant meta-data graph created by the NSA is also particularly valuable for &#x27;influencer&#x27; and &#x27;social contagion&#x27; analysis (leaks showed they do use it to understand internal chain-of-command and organization structure for target selection). You can bet - although direct proof is forthcoming - that other countries have these capabilities, or analogues to them, for targetting American and NATO news and social feeds.<p>These sorts of forces are abound on social media websites, as can be seen in the recent Wired article &quot;I liked everything I saw on Facebook for two days&quot; [10]. What&#x27;s more, the role that social media has begun to play in political races is incredible. If you have the time and interest, look up the capabilities of incumbent Obama&#x27;s &quot;The Cave&quot; for social media evangelism and tracking. Real time social estimates of support across dozens of major social media platforms with the ability to influence and target any of them at will. Interns scrambling to be &quot;first to post&quot; on online discussions in news media articles.<p>To be a member of online social media is to be surveilled by both governments and by corporations, to have your content curated for financial purposes, and to have your information sold to the highest bidder. It is also to be influenced not just by direct advertisement, but also indirectly through information that gets carried word of mouth. On the internet nobody knows that you are a dog. This is often an inconvenience and it allows trolls and other unsavory social behavior. Unfortunately it is now also true that on social media, those with the right perspective - those that can see social media at the thousand foot view - not only know that you are a dog, but also know how to make you drool when they ring a bell.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.linkdex.com/blog/social-contagion-why-ideas-and-products-become-popular/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkdex.com/blog/social-contagion-why-ideas-and-p...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://icos.umich.edu/sites/icos6.cms.si.umich.edu/files/lectures/VPDFinal1110.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://icos.umich.edu/sites/icos6.cms.si.umich.edu/files/lec...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.msi.org/reports/distinguishing-among-mechanisms-of-social-contagion-in-new-product-adoption/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msi.org/reports/distinguishing-among-mechanisms-o...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.msi.org/articles/what-drives-social-contagion-in-new-product-adoption-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msi.org/articles/what-drives-social-contagion-in-...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://socialmediaandmobileresearch.com/2014/03/10/social-contagion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://socialmediaandmobileresearch.com/2014/03/10/social-co...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://minerva.dtic.mil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minerva.dtic.mil/</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipula...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/22/hacking-anonymous"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/16/945768/-UPDATED-The-HB-Gary-Email-That-Should-Concern-Us-All"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/16/945768/-UPDATED-The...</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/08/i-liked-everything-i-saw-on-facebook-for-two-days-heres-what-it-did-to-me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2014/08/i-liked-everything-i-saw-on-fac...</a><p>Addendum: Another trend in advertizing is &#x27;contextual advertizing&#x27; where ads are injected into articles in ways that make them look like they are part of the content you intended to read.

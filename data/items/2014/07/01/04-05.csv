7969216,comment,7968596,7968907,3,0,vacri,,,"Excellent. Now I&#x27;ve bought my mac mini, I can plug it in and listen to it consume power. I wonder how I can see what it&#x27;s doing?<p>Hrm... well, it can come with a monitor... for an extra thousand. Okay, scratch that, I&#x27;ll get a cheap DisplayPort monitor... add a couple of hundred (or if I feel like splurging, get two). Oh, and a keyboard, another $50 (apple-branded, of course, because normal keyboards don&#x27;t have apple keys). Mouse? Apple mouse at $50+? Maybe I&#x27;ll go with a cheap logitech or something... 4GB memory standard? for a dev machine? OSX has trouble with that little memory. Up to 8GB for another hundred (or 16GB for three hundred). Spinning rust will do, but if you did want an SSD, throw on a couple hundred more.<p>The idea that mac minis are &#x27;cheap development boxes&#x27; is nonsense. It&#x27;s cheaper than a decent macbook pro, but it&#x27;s not a cheap workstation.",1404190781

I always thought it was just the new buzzword replacement for the age-old concept of humility.<p>>Smart people have a problem ... That problem is an ability to convincingly rationalize nearly anything.<p>My apologies to all us &#x27;Smart People&#x27; but this can be attributed to <i>&#x27;People&#x27; in general</i>. When we want to believe something, we will seek out objects, arguments, &#x27;evidence&#x27;, etc. that support that belief. If we find enough pieces (that also seem to complement each other) we will be satisfied.<p>Maybe &#x27;Smart&#x27; just means &#x27;more-equipped&#x27; (with ideas, studies, etc.) to rationalize something (more quickly or more &#x27;effectively&#x27;). Which also makes me wonder if we are just equating &#x27;Smart&#x27; (as a classification) to people who have a relatively wider knowledge/experience base to pull from relative to someone else? How else could we &#x27;rationalize&#x27; something new other than using/rehashing ideas we have come across already?<p>>But I think Impostor Syndrome is valuable<p>I agree.

Each of these look like individual libraries, and that&#x27;s the full name of the package that the library supplies. Sounds practical, especially since they have the source code of other non-NASA libraries checked in (e.g. rhino).<p>They could have merged the source trees of the individual components, but that becomes cumbersome as some of the third party components are under different licenses, and it&#x27;s likely that each of these packages are built and packaged into separate JAR files.<p>That folder name won&#x27;t be in the final JAR file, which will only have the hierarchy past the src folder.<p>Note that the JVM has a robust mechanism for custom classloaders, so you could actually implement your metadata idea if you wanted to. What will happen at runtime is that the JVM will invoke your custom classloader with the full class name (e.g. java.lang.String), and then you have to give it the Class object associated with it (which you can construct dynamically, produce from a byte array loaded from somewhere, or request from the JVM&#x27;s file-based classloader).",1404190305

7969202,comment,7969112,7969112,73,0,philipn,,,"I&#x27;m the ED of a 501(c)3 non-profit (<a href=""http://localwiki.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localwiki.org</a>), and when we applied for our (c)3 status we got some flack along these lines, as well.  Here&#x27;s my advice to the Yorba Foundation folks:<p>If you haven&#x27;t received your final rejection, you can appeal.<p>Don&#x27;t try and do this yourself.  The post says they spoke with folks at the Software Freedom Center, which is great, but I highly recommend finding a specialized attorney who&#x27;s seen lots of applications and knows the right angle.  Hire an attorney who specializes in obtaining 501(c)3 status.  We made this mistake early on, thinking we could work through the NOLO book and apply ourselves.  It cost us.  For around $1k you can find a good non-profit attorney to help.<p>We got flack for the open-source thing, too.  Our original exemption application was basically &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re a charity!  We give things away for free and release open source code, which can be used by everyone!&quot;  Depending on the IRS agent assigned to you, you might get flack for this as well.  Generally speaking, they may not like that a for-profit business can use your organization&#x27;s by-product to make lots of money for themselves.  We spent some time explaining how OSS worked to the agent, and was able to convince him that because (most) of our OSS is copyleft, that it would be a continually-free-and-open good, not a private benefit.<p>Nevertheless, just releasing OSS is <i>NOT</i> an exempt purpose.  If you read the IRS regulations, they are very specific as to what a core exempt purpose is.  You&#x27;ll need to pick one that fits best.  Generally speaking, it&#x27;s 1) Church stuff 2) Scientific advancement and research 3) Furthering of the arts 4) Education 5) &quot;Charity,&quot; meaning helping people who are disadvantaged in some way 6) Some others that I&#x27;m not remembering.<p>Most OSS 501(c)3 don&#x27;t get exemption by just releasing open source software-- they get exemption by being an educational institution.  So you may want to go that route -- the organization&#x27;s core exemption is the creation of educational materials that help education members of a particular community in XYZ ways.  This is what we ended up doing -- we&#x27;re classified as an educationally-exempt organization.  If you look up the 501(c)3 apps of some other OSS non-profits you&#x27;ll see similarly -- e.g. Plone Foundation is set up as an educational organization.<p>Edit: If you&#x27;d like to take a look at some of our back-and-forth with the IRS agent at the time, check out the page here: <a href=""http://localwiki.net/org/Historic_501%28c%293_application_process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localwiki.net/org/Historic_501%28c%293_application_pr...</a>  You&#x27;ll see his response was similar to yours, but we decided to pursue educational exemption and were granted on that basis in the end.  \nAlso, you can call up the IRS Agent assigned to you and talk to them about the application, which can be extremely helpful.",1404190164

Our dear physicist has been instructed to, if he is still alive after 20 seconds (adjusted to have 50% prob) to move the emitter just a tiny little bit to the left.\nNow according to the quantum laws, the photon from the original position should create an interference pattern with the photon from the slightly moved position... provided we succeeded in creating a superposition of dead/alive physicist.\nOf course, every single experiment would just give one detection, so we would have to do it many times, to really verify that it worked.<p>The experiment could of course be scaled up, so that we instead proved that we had superpositions of planets being blown up or something.

7969155,comment,7966680,7968270,1,0,w1ntermute,,,"> Do you have an idea for a business that scales that could pay relatively unskilled folks better than minimum wage?<p>The problem with this lies in the nature of most service sector jobs - they require physical proximity to those people being served. Contrast this with manufacturing jobs, where a factory can be set up in a remote town (or on the other side of the world, which is precisely why they no longer exist in America in large numbers) and the products shipped en masse to consumers.<p>Unfortunately, in America, our zoning laws/NIMBYism and poor public transit have made it extremely difficult for service sector workers to cheaply and efficiently serve the burgeoning upper middle class. Nowhere is this more apparent than in SF. If the Bay Area public transit system were better and if housing were much denser, then more unskilled workers could afford rent in/near the city and have short commutes to service jobs.<p>Rather than raising minimum wages, we should be working to lower the cost of living for those not as well off. Our cities are currently so inefficient that you could squeeze a great amount of sheer waste out of them.",1404188552
7969154,comment,7968538,7968538,1,0,cko,,,"&quot;We need better data; better dissemination of that data; and  better communication of that data, in ways that help people make decisions which reflect their wishes.&quot;<p>This is where I think good EMR software can make a difference - in gathering and organizing data. The quantitative data like lab values are probably stored electronically, but the clinical assessments are still scribbles on paper. Most of the physician notes are in SOAP format (Subjective Objective Assessment Plan), and many require educated guesses to decipher (I&#x27;m a pharmacist so I have to make these guesses daily). This alone makes data very difficult to gather. You can&#x27;t do a SELECT * query on this stuff. Every time I call a doctor&#x27;s office, they&#x27;ll put me on hold for some time while they flip through a patient&#x27;s chart. Combine that with the fact that there are multiple clinicians working on the same patient, each with their own set of medical records, the cardiologist might not know what the endocrinologist is doing. Also almost every medical institution uses fax machines. It&#x27;s 2014. Fax machines should not exist. So the first step to better data is better data-gathering.<p>Prescribing can also be a mess. Evidence-based medicine means there are standards for diagnosing and treating. For example, if a patient was recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, there is a certain protocol on what to prescribe, with considerations based on a patient&#x27;s status (say, kidney function). I think this is medicine equivalent of idiomatic programming constructs - just as &quot;cowboy coding&quot; is frowned upon, medicine shouldn&#x27;t be like House MD. But I frequently see patients being started on non-standard regimens. So not only are standards difficult to come by, sometimes they are not even being followed - and this too compounds the difficulty in gathering good data.<p>Relating to dissemination of data: My aunt was recently diagnosed with non small-cell lung cancer. The first step was surgery. Her next option was infusions of chemotherapy. She didn&#x27;t consult me on this matter, but I dug up some studies, and it appears that if she chose chemo it&#x27;d increase her 5-year survival rate by 5%. Currently based on her staging it&#x27;s 50%. Granted, aside from profound hair loss, one seizure, and likely adverse hematologic effects, I don&#x27;t observe any other damage, but I wonder if she would have made the choice to do chemo if she knew about that 5%.<p>Side note: I wish I hadn&#x27;t been so lazy in pharmacy school and really put in the effort to learn how to code. I remember opening up K&R a few times half-heartedly and not getting past the first three pages. Learning this stuff by myself is an uphill battle, even given the wealth of documentation out there. Most of pharmacy school was just &quot;memorize and regurgitate&quot; - once you got past Organic Chem it was all smooth sailing. Progress is super-slow, because I give up frequently, only to pick myself up the next day to start again. It&#x27;s only my vision of better medical software that keeps me going.",1404188532

The feature is as creepy as it&#x27;s all over the place.<p>I think the titles come from my Google Calendar, and the photos are put together by date. Albums mix activities that happen over the same time period, like photos of my daughter before a trip in the same album as the mundane, banal and, at times, painful photographs I took of my father&#x27;s flat and personal effects while documenting some paperwork I had to do during such trip, which was just after he died.<p>Thanks for the happy memories, Google!

8123484,comment,8122096,8122096,1,0,shitlord,,,"> Or, the researchers admit, it could mean that the examiners are getting more laid back about giving approvals over time.<p>I would agree with this. My dad is a senior patent examiner at the USPTO. After working his way up, he&#x27;s become a lazy GS14 (and so have all of his coworkers). Apparently, people at the patent office stop working hard after they reach GS13.<p>I guess it&#x27;s symptomatic of doing government work. I don&#x27;t mean to disparage government work, but approving patents isn&#x27;t what you think of when someone says &quot;public service&quot;. I see the same sort of thing at large companies as well.<p>If anyone has questions about how things work at the USPTO, let me know and I&#x27;ll ask him.",1406937534

8123452,comment,8122979,8123252,4,0,AceJohnny2,,,"I&#x27;ve come to understand where Hangout&#x27;s come from, and to appreciate its features. I say this as a longtime Jabber fan (yes, despite the XML-bloatishness that people complain about).<p>Hangouts is a more-featureful answer to the likes of Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger and Line. The global population has strongly switched to mobile chat apps. What does &quot;online/away&quot; mean when you can check your phone anytime, whether in the office, on the toilet, having lunch or dinner, etc? Sure, you might not be immediately able or willing to respond, but so what? Do you know anyone nowadays who actually expects an immediate response from a text message? Hangouts provides one discreet but useful feature previous chat systems didn&#x27;t : did you ever notice the position of your correspondent&#x27;s icon in the chat stream? That&#x27;s how far they&#x27;ve read.<p>My main issue with Hangouts is that the delivery-reliability on mobile is poor. I&#x27;ve had messages arrive minutes, hours, up to half a day after it was purportedly sent. At least I know my correspondent hasn&#x27;t seen it from the aforementioned icon feature... It happens often enough that I use Line whenever I want any guarantee of delivery on my/their phone. Despite the poor performance of <i>that</i> app...<p>Hangouts also provides a free and seamless way to do voice and video chat. It may seem common now, but prior to it only Skype was doing as good a job, and Skype didn&#x27;t provide the group-video feature for free! Google had long before provided protocol spec and open-source libraries to implement this in other Jabber clients. The pickup was dismal, so it&#x27;s understandable if Google decided to forge ahead alone with their own technological developments.<p>As for why they&#x27;ve abandoned the light GChat desktop app in favour of the Chrome-integrated plugin... Vanishly few people (at the scale of Google&#x27;s users) care about that, and it provides Google the guarantee that their users are running the latest version of the app. The latter is an incredibly powerful incentive, because it means they can expect feature and bugfix rollout to happen quickly, and not worry about legacy support. If you&#x27;ve ever developed a long-lived distributed app, you know how tempting that would be...<p>I remain deeply disappointed that Google won&#x27;t open the protocol, because it means users like us with the will and the means to build alternative implementations can&#x27;t do so. I don&#x27;t know what the state of reverse-engineering is for the protocol, but I figure that, being built on protobufs and with the fast-rollout mentioned above, this isn&#x27;t a viable hope, unlike previous chat systems that had to support legacy versions of their protocol for a long time.<p>I keep powerlessly hoping that someday Google, or some other mobile chat provider, will open up their protocol for technical users to get crazy with. In the meantime, welcome to the post-Jabber world and here&#x27;s your Koolaid.",1406936982

(This is the usual mathematical definition of the word &#x27;normal&#x27;.)<p>When shading a 3d-rendered surface, the normals at each pixel are used to determine how bright the light on the surface is at that pixel. (If the light is shining directly at the surface, i.e. along the normal, it&#x27;s bright; if it&#x27;s shining shallowly along the surface, i.e. at a sharp angle to the normal, it&#x27;s dim.)<p>If you make, say, a cube, and set all the normals &quot;realistically&quot; -- that is, you make them poke straight out of the squares that make up the surface -- and then you render a light shining on it, it will look like a cube. Every face will have all its normals pointing the same way, so every pixel on a given face will be lit the same and render the same brightness.<p>Now, instead, try _blending_ (or &quot;interpolating&quot;) the normals smoothly -- so the center of each face has a normal that pokes straight out, but as you get closer to the edge, it gets flatter, so by the time you reach a corner, the normals on both adjacent faces are pointing the same way, straight out of the corner.<p>If you can picture that, you should see that this will look a lot like the normals on a sphere, because you have a continuous gradient of outward vectors that smoothly covers every direction.<p>If you now light the cube, using the normals as discussed above, so that a head-on light is bright and a shallow light is dim, you&#x27;ll see that the faces are no longer lit with a single constant brightness, but rather a gradient that simulates the surface of a sphere.<p>So you&#x27;ll see an object that has a cube-shaped silhouette, but a surface that&#x27;s lit like a smooth sphere.<p>This will look very strange, but as you raise the number of faces you use, to 20 or 100, you&#x27;ll have an object that looks basically just like a sphere, except the outside edges are slightly angular if you look very closely.<p>(You can see an example of this object  here: <a href=""http://www.twodee.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sphere_phong.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twodee.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sphe...</a> , taken from this article: <a href=""http://www.twodee.org/weblog/?p=594"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twodee.org/weblog/?p=594</a>)<p>This is the same sort of cheating that the linked article is about, but the linked article is cheating even harder -- instead of merely blending the normals between adjacent surfaces, they&#x27;re actually reorienting the normals of one surface all the way &quot;around the corner&quot;, to point in the same direction of the normals on the adjacent surface. This means that when you look directly at the corner between the two surfaces, it will look like one surface extends around the corner, which gives the illusion of a notch in the corner.",1406935817

But the raw intellect required is not especially high--anybody above the 66th percentile would likely do just fine.<p>A long time ago I was in pre-med. Similar to the article, I got a 35 on my MCAT. I know a lot of physicians. They&#x27;re all very smart (because you have to be to get into medical school). The vast majority of them are bored with medicine. They do anything they can other than see patients. Some invest in real estate, some manage other physicians in a group practice--there&#x27;s one guy who built a small datacenter and runs a business selling electronic medical records systems as a service to other medical practices!<p>The point is--the practice of medicine kind of sucks. It&#x27;s mostly the same things over and over, with a lot of paperwork thrown in. Med school lures in the young with the prestige attached to the magic letters &quot;M.D.&quot; and because med school is an ultra-exclusive club for smart people.

Your wallet knows what it can spend, and you only consider payments paid when they are paid according to your terms.<p>A wallet isn&#x27;t tasked with knowing about crazy things that it might be able to spend if you modified the code—  what you&#x27;re saying is completely isomorphic to saying that the US Dollar has a weakness because someone could put a $100 bill in a locked safe with your birthday as the combination and bury it in your back yard without your knoweldge, and you wouldn&#x27;t know that you could spend it.<p>Any contract use with Bitcoin requires you to have software that understands the contracts— no wallet does or will ever show arbitrarily encoded contracts written by a third party.  Otherwise, someone could start &quot;paying&quot; you using 1 of 2 payment with one of them being a private key your wallet knows— then claw the funds back after you thought the transaction was settled.  Because a contract could do almost anything it would never be safe to just automatically accept them, in any system, and so nothing does or will.",1406934335

It's designed for specialists to use, and the knowledge of how to use it is a given prerequisite that the designer takes into account.<p>Cellphones on the other hand are one of the most widely distributed electronic devices in the world, and they're clearly designed for anyone to use.  It's certainly the designer's prerogative to assume the user will have a certain level of training and familiarity with it (or will take the time to learn it), but my argument is that in some cases a designer who goes the extra mile and makes a truly intuitive device has the opportunity to capture a much larger user base.<p>You could say that's what blogger did -- there were many ways to build a blog before, but Evan Williams and co. made it much easier to launch and maintain one, and that paid off for them.",1216310296

Generally, ETFs have lower expense ratios, but you have to pay a commission to buy them (maybe $10 per purchase at a discount broker). Mutual funds are usually free to buy. So if you're going to invest $100/month, go with a mutual fund. If you're buying $5K at a time, an ETF is fine. Never pay more than 2% of your purchase price on a commission, and <1% is better. There's a little more to it than that (the purchase price of an ETF may stray a bit from  net asset value, up or down), but that doesn't usually make a difference.<p>ETFs sometimes get a bad rap because there are so many slice-and-dice funds - gold mining ETFs, Alabama mid-size business ETFs, etc. Stick with the basics (stocks and bonds, US and international, developed and emerging, large cap and small cap).",1216310186

For thirteen years we were in start-up mode as all of our competitors were much larger than us. After I sold, I was truly burnt out and took some time to see the world and start a family. The money was holding out good until the crash of dot-com and a property purchase I made -- then I had to start looking for a job again.<p>For me, it was difficult because the advent of the internet changed everything, and my resume was filled with dinosaur skills. I knew it would be mistake to jump into the internet with my skills as they were, so I was able to find a job doing java.

The latter seems more Rails-ish whereas the former is more Javaesque, but it's still pretty early days. I prefer Clojure to Common Lisp as it doesn't have a lot of the cruft you'll find in CL, it has some cool concurrency features, and you get easy access to any Java library you might want to use. Plus, the source code to the language itself and its supporting libraries is very readable and hackable, which is something I haven't found in other languages.<p>I can't really recommend <i>web</i> programming with C, although it's a wonderful language to learn; I'm sure you'll have many revelatory moments as you get to grips with it and discover things about the higher level languages that you normally use.<p>Common Lisp is definitely usable for web development, and Hunchentoot is a pretty decent web server and programming environment, although it's certainly not the only one.",1216309768

Unlike most other statically typed languages, OCaml's type inference turns the type system from a thing that needs to be constantly appeased to a free reality check when you need it.<p>OCaml will also teach you functional programming tricks usable in Ruby, or several other languages. At the same time, it doesn't force you to learn almost everything all over again before you can do anything at all the way Haskell does. In my experience, OCaml is designed to be a practical, modern, statically-typed, multi-paradigm language, while Haskell is designed to be a conceptually pure language for experimenting with language ideas in new territories. Whether that's a good or bad thing depends on what you intend to use it for.<p>About the OCaml type system:\n<a href=""http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/2008/04/14/useful-things-about-static-typing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/2008/04/14/useful-things-ab...</a><p>""Why Rubyists Should Learn OCaml"" (a presentation): <a href=""http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/2008/07/07/rubymn-presentation-of-ocaml/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/2008/07/07/rubymn-presentat...</a>",1216309751

All three were quite good.<p>To summarize the first two (very roughly): The market isn't perfect and there are a lot of undervalued companies that are great. You have to find these companies at a significant discount to what they are really worth, and then you have to be patient enough for everyone else to realize their error.<p>The third would IMHO be more geared towards someone that wanted to be a professional. Fisher talks extensively about ways to interview management/competitors/clients for information not found on a balance sheet, and prefers to look for new technology companies with huge potential upsides. He admits himself that most of his success was due to a half dozen huge wins in his entire life, and he tries to document how to find such wins.<p>Realize that with Buffet's reading list you are going to end up wanting to invest like Buffet/Graham/Fisher, which means patience and a lot of due diligence on what you buy.<p>If you don't have 100 hours a week to research/interview prospects, Buffet and Graham would both recommend that you set a good allocation and buy index funds. Fisher would probably tell you the same, as he makes it very clear that he never buys a single stock without knowing the company like it was his own (which often included knowing the management on a first name basis).<p>And remember, the key to allocation-based investing is rebalancing, so you periodically lock in gains and don't get overly concentrated in one thing over time.",1216307561

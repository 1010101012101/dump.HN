Any examples of valid patent application would be very helpful e.g. has Loopt any? Also general advices for what to look for and be aware in patent process (before I dive in to read the whole patent spec).<p>Im from Europe and consider to take part in Android challenge, but without patent I guess I can't stand a chance; the idea is the important part.<p>Thanks a lot- Stepan\n",1195667620

I plan to make a pluggable system with a default store (probably CLSQL). Beyond that, people can contribute their own drivers to whatever store they wish.<p>At this point weblocks will be very usable. There will be many little things. Some that come to mind: automatically bundling css and js into one big file instead of many small ones for performance, more declarative validators, specialized presentation for more commonly used data types, ""persistant"" actions (so that you can send a URL of a grid sorted in a certain way to your friend), etc. However, each of these can be implemented in a couple of days or less, so I don't consider these issues essential.<p>After implementing the two major features described above, I'll move on to using Weblocks to write a commercial product. I'll deal with little issues as they come along.",1195667568

If you're adamant about getting the job done, let's talk.""<p>I consider myself as scarce and special as any opportunity I explore.  I will never post my resume anywhere.  I will not be a ""round peg"" for a ""round hole"" for any recruiter, HR department, or machine.

So you watch the pretty-the-first-time-you-see-them animated windows fly around and it says...""We're creating a station that plays XYZ song""...<p>and then it says, ""Lets start it off by playing ABC song...""<p>Huh?<p>Why did it list something in the search results that it doesn't have, only to play something else? And what the hell is ""creating a station""? Just play the song.<p>And as for classical music, they didn't have Turina, but they did figure out his first name when I only entered his last. Great feature. Probably leeched google.",1195666182

82497,comment,81976,82051,0,0,kogir,,,"It's not such horrid advice to follow.<p>As mentioned in another comment already, Loopt uses ASP.Net in addition to other Microsoft and open source technologies.<p>If I could start over, I'd use it again.<p>ASP.Net the <i>framework</i> is great.  By framework I mean the request pipeline and everything else on which the high level items like the TextControl are built atop.  There's a lot of crap at the top (built in controls, page viewstate, etc), but you're not forced to use it.  Hooks are exposed at almost every level of the stack where you can override the default behavior to do what you want (and I do).  The trick is knowing when to NOT use the built in stuff.<p>Also of note is that while ASP.Net necessitates IIS and Windows, it doesn't lock you down any further if you're willing to take a few risks (no vendor support).  From the beginning Loopt's website has used a custom session state provider: At first it stored all user state in encrypted cookies, but now it's moving to a fault tolerant, distributed Erlang based store.  Results from PostgreSQL servers running on FreeBSD power many of our GIS based features.  *nix based boxes perform all of Loopt's geocoding and map generation tasks.<p>At Loopt we try to pick the best tool for the job.  Sometimes it's sold by Microsoft.<p>Sidenote: You can pay for Microsoft software on a per box per month basis, and only pay for what you use.  I think that Windows Server Web Edition is only about $10/box/month.  Not actually that big a deal in the big scheme of things.  For example, good developers are WAY more expensive than software =P",1195665912

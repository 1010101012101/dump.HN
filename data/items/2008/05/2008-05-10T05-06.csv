186205,comment,185943,186053,0,0,webwright,,,"""Since YC sets up founders and angels in the best atmosphere possible, the founders can be completely product-focused.""<p>YC companies are completely product focused for 2.5 months.  That's it.<p>Then you dive into fundraising, which is close to a full time job for 1 of the founders...  And as much as YC helps, that still takes a long time.<p>As an illustration, of the 20+ YC companies that demo'd late March (6 weeks ago), only 2 are funded that I'm aware of, and a few more have term sheets (which is really the start of the negotiation... ""deals fall through"").<p>YC accelerates the funding process a bit, but a lot less that you might think.",1210399000

I think the way people do it is by using a hub and packet sniffers on a separate computer, although I imagine WoW traffic could easily be encrypted... so <i>shrug</i>.",1210397819

I don't think judges did a thorough job - I was monitoring logs on my server and they never tried the advanced features in our app. Those required the backend usage, so I would know and the phone-server connection was the whole point why we made the application in the first place.<p>Anyway, we have this app on Windows Mobile too, so we will launch it soon-ish to start getting the user feedback.",1210396516

in urban areas and less dense in rural areas, thus leading to exactly the same issues as directly using population density.<p>Please be so good as explaining you point better, I do not understand it. If you are going to wire up every lot in the state, you will have to traverse all roads in the state to do a cable drop to every lot in order to do so. What does road density have to do with it?<p>When building wireline communication networks, the deciding factor costwise, is the number of linear cable sheet miles. As such miles of road is a good proxy for comparing deployment costs between locations.<p>Please note that I am discussing <i>wireline</i> broadband. If you have you heart set on wireless coverage, then we have to talk different measures, and even there population density is not the tell all metric.<p>> But beside that, the public road mileage for Texas is off by a factor of two.

However that does not still make it cheaper to build in Finland, it merely brings up Texas and Finland to par on miles of road per population. Several things still favour Texas in the cost per capita, such as: economics of scale, ability to perform construction year around and no need to put utilities under the frostline.<p>There are no technical or cost reasons for Texas to be unable to offer the same level of broadband service as Finland. It all comes down to other reasons, perhaps such as lack of political will in Texas.",1336924705

3967282,comment,3967105,3967239,6,0,mjn,,,"With gamification of the workplace in particular, there seems to be a repeating cycle. Each cycle does come with some shifts in focus, but it seems mostly implicit ones, without a lot of reflection.<p>I've been doing some preliminary research trying to track down each of the cycles and how they relate, but the fact that so much of it is ephemeral and buzzword-heavy, and the studies are done by self-interested people with poor documentation of results, makes it a bit difficult.<p>As far as I can tell, the earliest proposals for using game-like processes to motivate and engage workers came in the Soviet Union, for the obvious reason that they needed a replacement for <i>monetary</i> motivation ASAP. Lenin called it ""socialist competition"", and had this vision of friendly, game/play-like competition as a replacement for cutthroat, loser-ends-up-homeless capitalist competition. I wrote a little about that here, though it's more like a preliminary collection of sources than a proper history at the moment: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/soviet_gamification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/soviet_gamification.html</a><p>Then sometime in the 1980s and especially the 1990s and 2000s, the idea of the power of games and play started becoming a huge thing in management. There was even a hilarious consulting job title for a while, ""funsultant"", someone who would come into a company and help make it more ""fun"" and ""gamelike"". I suspect there are similarities between today's ""gamification consultants"" and 1990s ""funsultants"", with the main shift being less focus on play and fun, and a bigger focus on reward/feedback loops. In effect the '90s game/play management techniques are merging with the much older behaviorist-reinforcement management techniques. I wrote a bit about the funsultants and some of the reactions to them as well (<i>Office Space</i>'s flair scene is probably the most memorable example of a backlash to mandatory fun): <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/funsultants_and_gamification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/funsultants_and_gamification.html</a><p>So I guess what I'm mostly missing from gamification advocates is a clearer picture of what's new here and how it relates to previous approaches. How much of it is about Skinner-style behavior-loop reinforcement? How much of it is about fun? About competition? How do the new approaches, whether we call them ""game mechanics"" or something else, relate to existing research findings on how effective each of these things are? As far as I can tell nobody actually wants to mention any of those things, instead presenting it as something totally new: game mechanics used to be used only for entertainment, but in the 2010s we realized they could be used to motivate non-entertainment things as well. But I don't think it just fell from the sky with no relationship to previous attempts.",1336924022

The OS has been rebuilt and just about every tweak possible has been applied - even a quick Google search shows that I'm not the only one having this problem.<p>Now in the past I've used a lot of different development tools and in those cases there is a loose coupling between things like editors (e.g. emacs, vi) and a particular development platform. Now I rather like VS and C# - but the prospect of buying completely new hardware (work and home) just to make up for deficiencies in Microsoft's tools is driving me crazy.<p>With .Net you really <i>do</i> have to use Visual Studio - if you don't then you probably have lost 70% of the benefits of the platform.

Running depth, RGB, and the motor only gets me up to 5W.<p>The Kinect power supply lists 100V-230V at 0.3A.  Using the minimum voltage, that's a peak draw of 30VA.  The power supply has a measured power factor of ~0.44, which if maintained to full load means it could draw .44*30=13.2W.  Somehow I doubt the power supply is actually 98% efficient at its normal operating range, so in a laptop where a 12V supply is already available, the additional power draw of a complete depth sensing system could be under 4W.<p>To sum up, I think you could successfully integrate depth sensing into a laptop that already has a camera and microphone array, especially considering that the sensing field will be much smaller.  Please correct my estimation if I've made any errors.",1295601229

I don't think I've estimated down to less than half a day, however: I've never been comfortable coming up with fixed hours-per-day number for the team. (As long as you can get enough work done in a 24-hour period, and I can get hold of you when I'm in the office, I don't care when you do it.)<p>However I'm not entirely comfortable with applying fudge factors like ""multiply all estimates by four"". I'd rather try to gauge the confidence that we have in our estimate: either by planning poker, or by coming up with separate worst case, best case and expected estimates.",1295601146

Sure, it's convenient for you as the programmer if you don't have to think about resources, but it always feels like the growth in hardware performance is mostly consumed by more and more needless resource usage.<p>Always reminds me of how cars are getting more and more efficient, powerful and clean-burning, and yet mpg is only barely creeping upwards.<p>Alternatively, an anecdote from my father- he was once tasked with upgrading the capacity of a company NAS, which was a few hundred megabytes, that was closing in on max capacity.

6652243,comment,6650122,6650122,1,0,csandreasen,,,"I think this is less a story of the NSA/GCHQ getting caught with their pants down than it is Google and Yahoo getting caught.  According to yesterday&#x27;s leaks, Google and Yahoo were (and continue to in Yahoo&#x27;s case) sending customer data between disparate locations across the globe <i>unencrypted</i>.  That means that not only could NSA/GCHQ have been pulling data from it - so could China, Russia, Iran, any other nation with a reasonably developed intelligence service, organized crime syndicates, etc.  We know that they collect unencrypted data against their targets.  Every intelligence service does using whatever means legally available to them.  That&#x27;s the nature of collecting intelligence.  The NSA isn&#x27;t going to hurt their bottom line, but failing to take proper security measures to secure their customers&#x27; data might.<p>The outrage that&#x27;s been pervasive throughout the tech community is based on the idea that the NSA is collecting data on <i>everyone</i>.  This article bases a good deal of its argument on that assumption.  All of the leaks have dealt with their sources and methods, though - not their targeting.  I&#x27;ve mentioned it in previous comments, but the media does a huge disservice by not giving us any insight into who they&#x27;re targeting.  If the NSA/GCHQ is targeting regular people/business executives/members of their own country&#x27;s government, show the evidence and let them face judgment for it.  Telling people that they <i>could</i> be conducting surveillance on everyone does nothing but generate fear and hype, tip off legitimate intelligence targets, and now possibly cause financial damage to major internet companies.<p>Some problems from the article that I&#x27;d also like to address, since I see them so often:<p>* The NSA claims that it targets only foreigners, but it needs only 51 percent certainty that those targets are actually outside the US. That’s pretty much a coin toss.*<p>The whole 51 percent thing came from the Washington Post&#x27;s original writeup on the PRISM slides,  The quote was:<p><i>The supervisor must endorse the analyst&#x27;s &quot;reasonable belief,&quot; defined as 51 percent confidence, that the specified target is a foreign national who is overseas at the time of collection.</i><p>The NSA&#x27;s wording quoted by WaPo is &quot;reasonable belief&quot;; WaPo&#x27;s wording is &quot;51 percent confidence&quot;.  Nowhere in any of the leaked documents does anyone ever mention &quot;51 percent&quot;, nor is it mentioned in any Congressional hearing to date.  The phrases &quot;reasonable belief&quot; and &quot;reasonable articulable suspicion&quot; do come up.  In the Congressional hearing from earlier this week they discuss the differences between that and &quot;probable cause&quot;, which is a much higher standard, but to say that an NSA analyst could flip a slightly weighted coin to meet the legal criteria for targeting under FAA 702 authorities is disingenuous.<p><i>Meanwhile, the odds of an American being killed in a terrorist attack, including overseas, are about 1 in 20 million. “Your odds of dying in a terrorist attack are still far, far lower than dying from just about anything else,” the Post noted.</i><p>It&#x27;s interesting that the author specifically mentions overseas locations - the author forgot about the military in doing so.  It&#x27;s worth noting that the NSA is an organization subordinate to the Department of Defense, and one its primary responsibilities is to provide signals intelligence to military.  The same military which has employed quite a few Americans in hostile areas overseas,  Since there are fewer than 20 million Americans serving in the military, one could use that figure to conclude that no serviceman has been killed during the past decade by anyone affiliated with a known terrorist organization.  I recently visited a family member being treated at a military hospital.  It was a bit shocking seeing the number of people moving past me in their wheelchairs using their 1-3 remaining limbs for propulsion and thinking to myself that these were the lucky ones.  You can debate the merits of war and whether or not they should have been over there in the first place, but claiming that today Americans aren&#x27;t getting killed by people working for the same organization that killed three thousand Americans back in 2001 is just wrong.<p><i>But in 2011, when the surveillance program was firmly in place and the anti-terrorism laws long since passed, there were nine recorded attacks in the US deemed as terrorism.</i><p>The NSA doesn&#x27;t have the authority to target people on US soil.  This is written in the law, rehashed at every Congressional hearing, and even confirmed by Snowden&#x27;s own leaks [1].  If an international terrorist group like Al-Qaeda struck the US again, it would be fair to call out the NSA for failing to protect US citizens.  You can&#x27;t fault them for failing to prevent a terrorist attack hatched entirely on US soil by US persons, which is why Congress call the FBI director to answer for Boston bombings, not the NSA director.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/758651-1qcy12-violations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/758651-1qcy12-violati...</a> (see page 6 - the section on &quot;roamers&quot;)",1383289104

All this does is change one&#x27;s perception of hot or cold. Even if it did a perfect job of that, which it won&#x27;t, it won&#x27;t keep you from dying of hypo- or hyperthermia.

6652238,comment,6651704,6652177,10,0,cromwellian,,,"Innovation happens when people can build on the efforts of others, and has been so for the entire history of man. Any system that puts up road blocks to sharing and propagating ideas inhibits innovation.<p>The justification for patents in software as providing shelter for inventors to work on their inventions while releasing the details of how they work is complete and utter bullshit and has been so for a long time. First, the way people share inventions in software is by publishing papers in journals, at conferences, or by shipping software, so that their peers benefit. No I know of has ever used a patent database or patent pending database as a search engine for knowledge sharing.<p>Secondly, software is shipped and revised so fast, and the time for patents to be granted, and successfully litigated in court, is so long, that more than enough time already exists for inventors to recoup their investments. It could take a decade or more to go from software patent application to successful litigation, so the idea that the patent protection is needed to shelter you while your startup executes is nonsense.<p>As far as I can tell, software patents serve one purpose and one purpose only: to inhibit and restrict competitors, or to shakedown successful companies with deep pockets.",1383289034

Homebrew makes it work, but you&#x27;re basically at the mercy of this third-party package system to keep things working, because the OS itself is broken for this kind of work.<p>Apple not shipping anything that is GPLv3 means that you have to rely on homebrew, which works great except for when it doesn&#x27;t, and you end up six hours deep into troubleshooting it. We&#x27;ve run into numerous edge cases where things don&#x27;t quite work right in OS X, even though it&#x27;s ostensibly still a POSIX toolchain.

You need to start in PlanAhead and design all the hardware then build the software stack for that hardware, and then you can maybe test some of your ideas you were trying to implement.<p>My goal is to put together a system for teaching people about computers. Looking back one can teach the equivalent of a 4 year CS degree (the CS classes anyway) from 20 years ago to get them the fundamentals, to pretty much anyone, except that the platforms available to do that are very complex. I was trying to teach basic concepts to kids and either the systems were too complex (PC&#x27;s) to really understand them all, or too simple (AVR) to do all of what you wanted. There were a lot of MCUs but most were designed (like the Atmel ATMega 328) for &quot;embedding&quot; so they had not enough RAM and too much flash for the kinds of things I got to do on a PDP-10 or a PDP-11 back in school. So I wrote a PDP-11 emulator for the ATMega 32. Its not all that hard and even running it out of serial FRAMs and with SPI emulating the front panel and switches, it can be as fast as an 11/23 was. But the reason I started there was that there was already other software that had been written for it (I was targeting an RT-11 bootup, but the smallest SD Card you can get is bigger than the largest Hard Drive you could use with RT-11 (140MB).<p>A number of people argued (successfully) that while a PDP-11 could teach basic concepts well, it would be better if you could re-use the experience in a more &#x27;modern&#x27; setting, so I&#x27;ve been using ARM Cortex-M processors in my latest iteration. The ARM-9 crosses a bit to far over the threshold but provides a great &#x27;follow-on&#x27; after the basic concepts are covered. One huge problem though is video.<p>My first video card was a Dazzler card (really easy S-100 video card) and later CGA, and VGA graphics. And while you can kinda/sorta to register level code on the RaspPi it was nothing like the C64 or Amstrad of its time. Those were machines you could understand completely. So a side project grew to build a &#x27;2D Framebuffer&#x27; for an inexpensive ARM system. I had been working the STM32F409 but just picked up an STM32F429 which has a simple frame buffer built in. Prior to that I was thinking something along the lines of the sun CG3 frame buffer with shared DRAM connected via the FSMC port on the ARM chip to provide 16MB of memory accessible to the FrameBuffer and user programs. The Zedboard provides a nice HDMI plug connected to FPGA fabric for doing that research even if the ARM9 is over kill, once finalized my plan was to move the Framebuffer design to a Spartan3e series (the one I was looking at is $10 in 1K quantities.)<p>But what I have <i>not</i> been able to do is to build a system with the Zedboard and just iterate on the Framebuffer part. In the ideal scenario I&#x27;d be able to reconfigure the FPGA on a running system but that has its own issues. I&#x27;d settle for rebooting into the next generation framebuffer but all I&#x27;ve been able to do is full up place and route followed by full scale sysgen. Very very painful.<p>More than you wanted to know I&#x27;m sure but it&#x27;s a sore point with me :-)",1383286310

Apparently, the Xbox One is the <i>first</i> Xbox to be sold at a profit or break-even from day one; this was <i>such</i> a bold move that <i>Forbes</i> devoted a whole column to it: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/09/06/microsoft-upends-the-economics-of-games-machines-with-xbox-one/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/09/06/microsoft...</a><p>(Other articles indicate that most consoles are sold at a loss.

Over six years later, what do they have to show for it? I bet plenty of companies will start thinking that FRAND and royalty-free aren&#x27;t all that different.",1383285803

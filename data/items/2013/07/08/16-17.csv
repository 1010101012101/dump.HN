6007746,comment,6006393,6006716,20,0,api,,,"These are all really cool and can be very useful, but personally I think decentralization and meshnets are to some extent a &quot;false god&quot; from a political and activism point of view.<p>The fact is that any nation state can trivially attack the physical Internet. It can order any corporation operating under its jurisdiction to cooperate. It can force any operator to install filtering software or equipment. Come hell or high water, it can physically unplug things, force power companies to turn off power, etc. Given a political worst case scenario the wired Internet (and that includes things like 4G) will not and cannot be any safer from state tampering than any other infrastructure.<p>Completely anarchistic decentralized meshnets that operate over things like peer to peer wireless have another problem. I am not aware of any existing totally decentralized meshnet protocol that isn&#x27;t vulnerable to some form of attack against its trust system.<p>There&#x27;s the sybil attack: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack</a><p>Then there&#x27;s &quot;long con&quot; attacks where a group of malicious nodes joins the network and pretends to be friendly for a long period of time, adding a lot of resources and gaining a lot of trust, only to finally use that trust to fragment, DOS, snoop, or otherwise harm the network.<p>Any of these attacks are well within the technical capability of a well-funded nation state.<p>In addition, any wireless mesh can have its users located through frequency triangulation. A nation state wouldn&#x27;t even have to arrest everyone. It could simply isolate the most important nodes, locate them, and confiscate the equipment or pressure, arrest, or pay off their operators. For a fee some trusted operators might be transformed into double agents.<p>The reason I call it a &quot;false god&quot; is that I fear for some it can act as a substitute for real political activism. The fact is that in a political worst case scenario, nothing is safe. Thus the real battle to be fought is not in the technical sphere but in the <i>human</i> political sphere. We must preserve our liberties or they will be taken from us, period, and no amount of clever tech will truly stop that once the enemy is upon us.",1373302720

The reality is that the console business is a big company game, and Nintendo is just too small. You need to sink billions of dollars to develop and subsidize the console, be willing to lose money for years and then do it all over again 6-10 years later. Microsoft can do it, and Sony can do it, Nintendo can&#x27;t. They need to make money because unlike Microsoft and Sony, they don&#x27;t have other revenue streams. This necessities them releasing under-powered consoles. They got lucky with the Wii. They are not so lucky with the WiiU.<p>They are still the king of mobile console gaming ... sort of. Tablet and smartphones are eating away their bottom line, and the trend will continue (the minute that Apple and Google decide to focus on mobile gaming in earnest will spell the end of Nintendo). The problem for Nintendo is that mobile gaming is an afterthought for Apple and Google. They don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to do well in that area to survive, however every point of marketshare that Nintendo loses because little Johnny is fine enough playing games on his iPad instead of buying a 3DS hurts Nintendo incredibly. Everyone will have a smartphone or a tablet, so justifying a 3DS purchase is that much harder.<p>They make good games, yes, but it won&#x27;t change the fact that they are in a lot of trouble.",1373302032

The Supreme Court in 1991 said things are &#x27;relevant&#x27; if there is a &#x27;reasonable possibility&#x27; that they will produce information related to the subject of the investigation. In criminal cases, courts previously have found that very large sets of information didn&#x27;t meet the relevance standard because significant portionsinnocent people&#x27;s informationwouldn&#x27;t be pertinent.<p>As a general rule, words have to be interpreted in the context of the laws that use them, because the same word can have different connotations in different laws. To use a programming analogy, talking about what &quot;relevant&quot; means in the law is like talking about what &quot;num_files&quot; means in programming. You can get a very general idea from the text, but you don&#x27;t really know what the term means without looking at the rest of the source.<p>&quot;Relevant&quot; means different things in the law. The article cites the narrow definition used in criminal search cases, but the Patriot Act is about foreign intelligence, not criminal prosecutions. In the law of evidence, for example, &quot;relevant&quot; is extremely broad: anything that could change whether some material fact is more or less likely to be true. You can&#x27;t take the Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;relevant&quot; in one case and apply it to the interpretation of the Patriot Act, just as you can&#x27;t take a variable name in one program and assume it means the same thing in another program.",1373300786

If suddenly a browser extension or app started sending &quot;noise&quot;, to whom will it send it? A network? Where to get the list of IPs to spam? Just randomly? Just randomly is detectable! Thats easily filtered out - just exclude the network from the important data they tap. What if you randomly send a bunch of cat pictures and random noise to people of your contact list? This is called spam and receiving such, is not nice, as we can filter it on the receiving end, so can NSA filter it from their important calculations. But then you might think, lets send noise randomly and in the random noise let us communicate... meh, basically what a &quot;P2P noise network&quot; would do is increase the hassle and usability of computing systems for everyone involved but wouldnt really offer privacy for us.<p>When you kind of begin to make it less random, then you basically introduce plausible deniability and onions and begin solving problems that people are already working on and who need your help there more than &quot;p2p noise network&quot;, then youre back to &quot;lets make a good usable p2p anonymous/deniable communication system that can withstand NSA as advesary&quot;.<p>Still, it is an interesting idea, how to flood NSAs/FRA/GHCQs systems? Can we make a browser extension thats easy to use that would randomly GET pages from your history while you are actually away from computer - generating false content and increasing bandwidth usage, or a configurable spider to follow links/pages or even friends streams of choice? Would you use spammers techniques of markov chains to post random crap on open systems? Meh, thats still just an inconvenience for NSA.<p>What seems to be really important is who talks to who then how do you get in contact with strangers on the internet without NSA knowing? How would you know the stranger youre talking to isnt a cover agent?",1373300549

In fact, wouldn&#x27;t this have been obvious from discussions with the client before the freelancer&#x27;s bid was accepted?  If we abdicate our responsibility to guide the customer to make good choices using our skills and experience, then we often get indecisive clients.  Otherwise we are reduced to glorified order takers.  For example, if we got the RFP specs and are chatting with the client as we prepared our response, it is perfectly valid to ask them how they arrived at these requirements.

If a given result from xor is <= that constant, you have reached your destination. Because obviously, you won&#x27;t have node IDs actually matching your target (e.g. file) hash (assuming no hash collisions.) So you need a &#x27;proximity&#x27; value.<p>Granted, the whole picture is more complex, and my knowledge is very limited. A node that wants to search for something sends its search query to the neighbour closest to target, which then, as I understand, propagates / rebroadcasts that query to <i>its</i> neighbour which itself is closest to destination. There seems to be some redundancy involved / multiple paths taken, perhaps to ensure that all nodes within that proximity distance are found. (So for example there could be multiple nodes storing the same key (say, file hash), but with different values (different node IDs (for nodes that actually have the file in question.))) I&#x27;m being vague though, that&#x27;s very true..<p>But as I understand it, as long as the whole graph of nodes is connected, with no orphan sub-graphs forming / detaching (something which may not be trivial to accomplish/ensure), you should be able to get all relevant key->value pairs / reach all relevant nodes in your search. The way the search is concluded in Gnutella (I think) is that each target node responds by connecting to the source/query-issuing node directly (every query carries with it source UDP IP:port (I think)).<p><i>edit</i> / P.S.: also, it may be that a given node stores node IDs in its proximity range (the &#x27;close enough&#x27; value), but I&#x27;m not sure of this; I&#x27;m adding this because it may actually help ensure that all nodes / key->value pairs of interest are accounted for, i.e. it&#x27;s a worthwhile idea anyway.",1373300426

We have no external funding, so without revenue coming in we can&#x27;t really keep going.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions, or links to relevant resources, on how we should structure this?

Many times I&#x27;ve taken over a client from someone else who warned me they were horrible to work with, and I found they just wanted fast turnaround (i.e. within a couple days) for very small changes (15 minutes to 2 hours), maybe 2-3 such changes a week. I did the work, billed them, and they paid. If it was a bigger change I&#x27;d tell them that up front, and they&#x27;d okay the work and accept a later delivery, or work with me to change the scope. It makes the client happy and wins you all kinds of good will. With a good relationship, these &quot;unreasonable&quot; clients were all quite reasonable if I occasionally had to tell them I was booked and needed an extra week or so to get to something. I&#x27;ve really only had one true problem client, and with him it was more because he wanted to change the project scope repeatedly without changing the cost. I think a lot of programmers in client-facing roles would benefit themselves (or their agencies) if they prioritized client satisfaction as highly as technical excellence.",1373299363

2001766,comment,2001177,2001482,0,0,loumf,,,"I think attributes of a town are more important than size.  I live in a 30k population town (Northampton, MA), but we have a college (and others in neighboring towns) and great culture, restaurants, etc.  The downtown is extremely walkable and has a music/bar scene.  I know of a few great software companies in town or very nearby (e.g. cemerick's company).  The best developers would have no problem finding a good job here -- my company has no problem finding great developers.<p>We may have fewer developers and companies, but it's the ratio that matters.  When I lived in NYC, I could identify great developers, but the competition for them was fierce.  The same went for the best jobs.  It was about the same level of difficulty in NYC as Northampton, MA for me to find a great job and once there to recruit others.",1292270353

Kayak built a pretty substantial company off this model and there are plenty of other examples.<p>If the issue is with ticket scalping, is a secondary market that horrendous of a thing when the primary market is so inefficient?  Also, what about the tickets listed and sold on Stub Hub and similar sites that sell below face-value?<p>If I'm going to pay over face for a ticket, I'd rather have Stub Hub around than the old way of dealing with ticket brokers.

There is no pressing <i>financial</i> reason to switch yet. As a node on the Internet you can either request an IPv4 address for, say, $0.25/month and make that go as long as possible, or you could drop whatever other work you are doing and replace/upgrade, test and deploy your entire hardware architecture just so that at some point when IPv4 support starts getting dropped (not happening in one year), you can be ready.<p>Once again, everybody relax. IPv6 will happen. As soon as it is cheaper to upgrade your entire infrastructure than getting another batch of IPv4 addresses, everyone will jump on board. In the mean time, just breathe.<p>And lastly, two 16 byte addresses cannot possibly fit into a 20 byte header, so there is no way that IPv6 would have been compatible with IPv4.",1292270232

2001733,comment,2001177,2001177,0,0,grammaton,,,"I think the author is attacking a bit of a strawman.  It seems that the discussion of ""major metropolitan areas"" assumes either San Francisco and the Valley, New York, or Boston.  Now it's true they're the main tech hubs, but they are far from the only decent sized cities with a booming software market.  Here in Philadelphia, for instance, I've never had undue trouble finding a job.  However it's generally true that you'll do better in New York than you will in Philly - and a lot better in Philly than you'd do in the middle of the state.  It's a simple fact of life that software development, by and large, tends to cluster around the nearest large population center. You'll have an easier time finding a job in the city for a fairly wide range of careers, for that matter, simply because there's more employers around.  That's neither exceptionalism or arrogance - that's just how it is.<p>To lay my cards on the table - I grew up in a small town in boondocks, PA, and live in Philadelphia, which is not exactly a speck on the map.

This is an important distinction because the federal government does not innately have any powers so it does not make sense to say that some power is reserved to it in this context. It is the same way with states, but since the states ceded some of their powers (which had previously been granted to them by the people, who are considered to be the ultimate source of the powers by the predominant philosophy of the founders) to the federal government it makes sense to say that the states reserved some of their powers.<p>Also, the mandates you speak of should be looked at for what they are: loopholes. The federal government was not granted the power to explicitly set (for example) the legal age of alcohol consumption, so it used the loophole to effectively give itself that power. So the guidelines should never work. When the federal government tells the states to follow guidelines, they should be allowed to say ""shove it"" without being punished because the federal government was never given the power to set those guidelines in the first place.",1292269365

Many people view this as ""I'm proposing the panacea of web security"" rather than ""Can't we design something better? Here's my proposal"".<p>There are many things you can do to make authentication more secure, and all of them are public. A good way is HTTP digest access authentication, but that won't work for a web app because you have to pass the state yourself, and it can be faked. Therefore, the best way I've found so far is to use SSL, although that SRP RFC might be interesting (I'm reading it right now).",1292269147

Totally FWIW though, a stupidly quick googling (<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=software+ann+arbor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=software+ann+arbor</a>) reveals a fair number of software companies doing stuff from factory floor automation to RFID to iPad apps to circuit design to network management and analytics.  Your ""4-5 companies"" phrase was surely hyperbole, but it would appear that there's worthwhile stuff going on in Ann Arbor.  (""Worthwhile"" being entirely subjective, of course.)<p>Besides that, all I can do is offer my own anecdote.  I started Snowtide in 2001, failed badly (via circumstances and my own stupidity), resurrected it in 2004, and it's been profitable ever since.  Bootstrapped from the beginning (the products we sell and the problems I'm interested are largely of little interest to VCs), we've grown (and shrunk -- last year was not fun) in Western Massachusetts the whole time.  While we had offices in Northampton (pop. 28K according to Wikipedia), we hosted a series of talks; Rich Hickey came in 2008 (<a href=""http://cemerick.com/2008/03/21/western-mass-developers-group-and-snowtide-host-rich-hickey-and-clojure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cemerick.com/2008/03/21/western-mass-developers-group...</a>), and Ben Fry in 2009 (<a href=""http://cemerick.com/2009/04/28/snowtide-informatics-welcomes-ben-fry/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cemerick.com/2009/04/28/snowtide-informatics-welcomes...</a>).  We regularly had showings of over 30 @ 7PM on thursday nights, and closer to 50-60 for the Hickey and Fry talks (something that I know fairly popular groups in Boston and NYC have trouble pulling off) -- all remarkably pleasant, talented people doing interesting work, either for other local companies or as telecommuting contractors.<p>Perhaps it's the universities and colleges in the area that make it work – it's Massachusetts after all, so you literally can't drive for more than 10 minutes without passing another one.<p>In any case, when I hear people say (or, more typically, imply) that vibrancy in software community and opportunity is somehow naturally limited to specific geographies, I get a little irritated: that attitude might keep someone else (more like, <i>many</i> someone elses) from starting a company or taking a job in a locale that isn't on the ""shortlist"", even when locale isn't relevant to their success.",1292269003

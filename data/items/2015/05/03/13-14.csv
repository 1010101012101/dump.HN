CLOS was a bit of a dream language, I&#x27;d say Scala is perhaps the closest practical language in terms of ideas.<p>Interestingly, this work led Gregor Kiczales & team to create Aspect Oriented Programming - a subset of his metasystem - which became somewhat popular with Java and the Spring framework&#x27;s use of AspectJ.<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming</a><p>As an aside, I found in college (let along high school!) that students have almost anti-philosophical learning objectives.  The SICP approach of teaching computer science from the metasystem up with Scheme (and then possibly moving on to CLOS/Lisp) was near-universally hated among my peers (1996-2002) - most wanted a practical language they could &quot;get a job&quot; with.

9481282,comment,9480390,9480864,0,0,peatmoss,,,"As an urban planner (well, PhD student now), the utility of electric bikes strikes me as obscenely high. We know that the vast majority of urban trips are < 3 miles--with a goodly portion under 1. Yet, so many people make these trips by car. A bike is very much more efficient, and often much faster if there is any congestion.<p>Electric bikes remove one major barrier people have, namely the arrive sweaty after a hill climb factor. I hear other bicyclists claim that this is less karmic because of exercise, but I view it differently. We know that, controlling for type of infrastructure, the prevalence of bicycling is strongly correlated with improved safety. The plausible explanation I subscribe to is that, with increased numbers, drivers are more accustomed to looking for bicyclists, and that bicyclists are better able to establish good group norms about how to ride safely. And of course increased numbers also mean that there is more political will to add more bicycling infrastructure, which in turn generates more bicycling. Electric assist bikes help with all aspects of this, with the exception of getting the maximum amount of exercise on every trip.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a business model that figures out how to 1. create a desirable electric bike brand 2. Have a low-barrier-to-entry rental or lease mode 3. Handles maintenance in a frictionless, reassuring way--perhaps with roadside emergency support 4. Has great on boarding for how to ride safely and confidently, perhaps coordinating with local bike clubs for instruction and personalized route planning.",1430661261

If you change your internal software structure and the data is stored in another way or you choose the make your library concurrent internally where different parts could mutate the vector while the user might request the same data in parallel then returning the slice would no longer be possible. And so you would have to change your external API and all consumers of the API only because you wanted to change internal things.<p>But as I said: Depends on the use-case.",1430660595

The doctor will send say $1000 bill to insurance company for a simple checkup (yes, it can be that bad). THe insurance company then will say &quot;no no sir, we only allow $200 for this specific item&quot;. Then insurance company will figure out how much you the patient ius supposed to pay out of that $200 (copay, co-insurance etc) and THEN they will pay the remainder to the doctor.<p>See the issue here ? The price of a simple checkup is inflated from $200 (we can argue on this too) to $1000. This $1000 is just to scare you but really does not mean shit.<p>Imagine that the doctor could bill you that $200 directly anyway or whatever amount they eventually get from insurance company.

Doctors/hospitals need to have transparent pricing just like other businesses and insurance should only bee needed for really catastrophic events like cancer, major accident etc.<p>I would much rather pay $200 to a couple of visits instead of paying insrance $1000/month just to &quot;insure&quot; myself.",1430660088

They have very few actual pages on their site, and they don&#x27;t change depending on who is making the request. If I request the site over HTTPS, anybody that is sniffing my traffic will know that I&#x27;m visiting that domain and thus can request the content themselves. The encryption here is not providing anything.<p>The value of encryption as a whole increases when <i>everything</i> is encrypted, because it is harder for an adversary to distinguish &quot;important&quot; traffic from &quot;unimportant traffic&quot;. It may not matter for that domain alone, but it certainly matters in the bigger picture. It significantly increases adversary cost.<p>> If you are sending/receiving personalized data, e.g. logins, search requests, etc., then you should be encrypting the requests. You would still be encrypting huge amounts of data for no reason, the CSS and static images used on the site are not being transmitted with or based on any personalized data, so any sniffer will already know that these resources would have been downloaded by you anyway (and I don&#x27;t care if an attacker sees the CSS of a page I&#x27;m looking at anyway). Requesting these static resources over plain HTTP, but authenticated via hashes or signatures, doesn&#x27;t provide an attacker with any information they wouldn&#x27;t already have.<p>False. Assets can leak very easily, disclosing what content you are looking at. Just identify which assets are not loaded on <i>every</i> page.<p>> And yet Tor is the only way to actually protect against sniffers tracking which domains you visit. If we really care about encrypting all the content - including non-personalized, static content - then I don&#x27;t see why we wouldn&#x27;t also care about protecting the domains we visit.<p>It&#x27;s not. The exit node still sees your traffic - and this is also why routing everything over Tor is a terrible idea (and incidentally, the same reason devices like the Anonabox are fundamentally broken). If you tunnel personally identifying traffic along with &quot;anonymous&quot; traffic, you&#x27;re &quot;contaminating&quot; the anonymous traffic with your identity.<p>> I totally agree with this. However I think I come to a different conclusion. [...]<p>Saying that TLS is &quot;not entirely useless&quot; is a very poor argument for not working on making it better.<p>The &quot;different levels&quot; you suggest are pretty much already implemented as such, except there is no &quot;authenticate but don&#x27;t encrypt&quot; level, because it&#x27;s not a useful or desirable level to have.",1430658817

So that&#x27;s phosphate rock fertilizer, oil, various grades of coal (anthracite is basically gone already).  You can also peak infinite / renewable resources like northern atlantic cod which are basically extinct now.  Or buffalo, etc.  Its interestingly fractal in that the smaller graphs of small producers look the same as graphs for other small producers and the overall system-wide graph.  So the graph of Texas oil which peaked in the early 70s looks about like Mexico&#x27;s graph looks like the world graph, all peaking at different dates, which is interesting.<p>As a secondary effect once you peak fertilizer and oil production, the secondary industries will peak.  Refineries obviously follow oil production.  But, modern industrial ag is heavily dependent on chemical fertilizer (which will peak) and oil (fuel, sprays, simple transport...)<p>Colloquially &quot;peak&quot; seems to be confused (intentionally, by some?) with short term downward market fluctuations.  So obviously they&#x27;ll never, ever be a peak in oil production because the market cost fluctuated downward recently for a short period of time, LOL.<p>For cars you need oil and iron, both of which you can eventually use up, so aside from all other arguments its possible.  But a cultural or economic shift can mask that.  So the wikipedia article is full of weird assertions that increasing the average GDP per capita must result in increased miles traveled because income inequality doesn&#x27;t exist (LOL).  Locally decreasing the number of &quot;can afford a car&quot; jobs from 2 million to 1.5 million will dramatically decrease road traffic, even if the average income for the area explodes because the 1% are richer than ever because its not like they&#x27;re going to drive extra miles to celebrate.<p>For literacy there doesn&#x27;t seem to be an inherent finite resource we can use up to eliminate literacy.  So traditional logistical peak doesn&#x27;t seem possible.  In the colloquial sense of peak meaning &quot;a short term downturn&quot; that is pretty trivial.<p>So you&#x27;ve listed all three possibilities, a finite resource that can peak, a secondary industry that depends on peakable finite resources, and something that can&#x27;t possibly have a logistical peak because there is no finite resource to exhaust.",1430658510

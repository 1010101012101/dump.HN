You just failed the job interview.<p>You're like the 4th person I've seen that read (some) of this article and pulled this tree vs. hash thing out of it. It's a throwaway point. Binary trees provide comparable performance to hash tables, but also provide efficient access to ranges of keys. Binary trees support more operations efficiently than hash tables.<p>The article isn't about some war I've declared on hash tables.",1200977789

102023,comment,101920,102019,0,0,tptacek,,,"You're correct. Surely I'm not arguing that. That would be a stupid argument. What I am arguing is that deliberately stiffing your employer for a raise while spending all your real cycles building your own company can fuck over your teammates.<p>Look, you just said you agreed it was a dick move. Great! Do you agree with what you yourself said, or not?",1200977631
102022,comment,101888,101888,0,0,tx,,,"The question remains in the air: how do I perform more complex queries without SQL? The proposed distributed hash table won't do it.<p>The article mentioned eBay's scaling PDF offering a link at the bottom. I followed the link read every page of that PDF and have not found any evidence of them abandoning (or minimizing use of) RDBMS.  eBay still runs Oracle, but uses in-house built index for listings search, but that's hardly a solution for general problem of running queries more complex than SELECT * FROM Foo WHERE ID=n. Besides <i>NOBODY</i> uses SQL to do complex full-text searches, even small companies I worked for. We used Lucene.<p>I would love to have a ""distributed SQL"": scaled-out SQL server in proper sense of the word, capable of running complex SQL queries on distributed sets of data. Hopefully by the time we grow to eBay size someone will innovate in that regard. Or, perhaps, it exists already?",1200977600

But even if you could: you'd be right to cap on java.<p>Java makes programming difficult. Some people like that. Many don't.<p>Ruby makes programming easier. RoR makes doing webapps easier. This guy's premise, that there is no overarching philosophy to RoR, is incorrect, and shows unnecessary ignorance and anger. You have to wonder if he's just projecting.",1200976400

Good to meet you as well.<p>Some perspective: I'm not a coder, yet I am starting a web business. I previously founded and grew a non-tech startup to 2 million in revenue in our first 18 months. I fucked it up and made a horrible exit with very little cash.<p>Currently, I'm on step 5 of the blog post, with a new raise working both a full-time job and a startup company.<p>I do worry about market risk, so I'm researching several customers for the technology besides the obvious B2C. My biggest concern is a roadblock with google also focusing on the concept for ShelfMade. <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/19/google-magazine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/19/google-magazine/</a><p>Not to start a fight, but I will be kicking your ass in fantasy football next year. And if ShelfMade has revenue or funding, we'll be doing it on Yahoo fantasy sports, agreed?",1200975392

And since this is Hacker News, I figured there would be lots of debate.  When I posted the original question, I just wanted to see if there were any women.  So far 2 have spoken up (one appeared to be a lurker who registered to comment on the discussion).  I don't know how many total active users there are (~500 who comment?) so I hoped there would be 5-10.  Thought it would be cool anyway.  Thanks everyone for the great discussion!",1200975024

This type of innovative combination is common in the network world due to the necessity of providing ever more introspection and functionality over ever higher throughputs and ever lower latencies. For some serious treatment of the subject, check out the book ""Network Algorithmics"" by George Varghese.",1200974440

102008,comment,101969,101969,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"He says binary trees are better default search table than hash table... binary tree search is O(lg(n)) while hash table is O(1)... so hash table is better for search, binary trees win in other ways (like ordered traversal if you need that), but no way you could say one is <i>always</i> better than the other.<p>Also confused how he proposes to build his Radix Trie in less than linear time... just seems like he ditches his original premise and launches into routing. There are selection algorithms that will find things in an unsorted array in O(lg(n))... but pretty sure building a tree of any sort is not part of it.<p>Radix Tries are sweet fun... so is just good old Radix Sort, but he starts with something that doesn't really make sense for the topic (the unsorted array he wants to pull three out of), then makes some weird claims, then jumps into routing with Radix Tries... not sure what is insightful here.",1200974405

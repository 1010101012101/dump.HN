3963377,comment,3962945,3963226,5,0,edanm,,,"I'm not blaming you specifically, but this is the problem - anytime someone points out something that could be better with vim, people jump in to show ""yes vim CAN do that"". And they're right. It's just that it's done <i>worse</i>, and takes a lot of setting up to get right.<p>To elaborate on the ""worse"" part, there are a few problems right now:<p>1. <i>The plugins don't interact nicely with each other.</i> For example, NERDTree exists, but it doesn't always play nicely with other plugins. Keeping it always stuck on the left side of the screen, taking up the same space, is not possible. If you use fuzzyfinder, for example, running fuzzyfinder from withing the NERDTree buffer will open the new buffer INSTEAD of NERDTree. This is <i>never</i> what I want. For another example, try jumping to a saved mark across files (e.g. 'V) from within NERDTree.<p>This is not even getting into plugins that will create new windows, and screw with your window layout, including messing up NERDTree.<p>In my vision, I would want to have a sidebar, make it keyboard-controllable of course, just make it ""outside"" of the actual vim, letting you control it absolutely. This is just one example.<p>2. The second problem is, vim <i>looks bad</i>. I'm sorry, but little graphical conveniences just don't exist in vim, and it is often the worse for it. For example, open Sublime Text's ""find if project"" drawer. It looks much better, is better convenience-wise, and it's something I use 200 times a day - I want it to be perfect. The fact that the drawer appears in the top-left, has a larger font-size, uses bold properly to make it clear what you're selecting, etc., is something that is just plain BETTER.<p>3. As for the current solutions to some of the things you mentioned:<p>Find file in project plugins: Yes they work. They don't look nice (see point 2 above), but they do exist. However, you have a choice between:<p>- Command-t, which is annoying to set up (don't take my word for it - look at the list of users who rant and rave about how good ctrl-p is, because it is easier to set up!).<p>- Ctrl-p - awesome (I use this one), but often slow. Especially when I want to display 50 results at a time (I have a large screen, I want to USE it). Coloring all the results is slow, and I'm not on a slow machine or anything. I'm not even talking about the indexing time, which luckily for me isn't a problem with my currently small projects.<p>- FuzzyFinder - nice, but looks terrible, and has a lot of funky behavior. E.g., the NERDTree mess (ctrl-p avoids this by writing code in the plugin to detect ""common buffers"" and not load things into them - not a scalable solution).<p>As for tabs, sure, vim has tabs - except they're not supposed to be used like the tabs everyone is familiar with, because that's what buffers are for. They're more for ""workspaces"". Forget the terrible naming of a feature which is similar, but different to what everyone else in the world means when they say ""tab"" - there are still no <i>good</i> ways to show which files you have open. It's not a killer feature, but a convenience a lot of people would like.<p>Summary: Let me get this straight. I <i>love</i> vim. I adore it. I kind of hate it, because having used vim, I can't find myself liking anything else - even my beloved Sublime Text 2, which is an amazing editors, frustrates me for lack of vim features.<p>The reason I write all of this is because I want the editing experience of vim, but the ""everything-else"" experience of Sublime Text 2 (or any modern editor). That would be an amazing thing.",1336816291

3963349,comment,3960876,3961579,1,0,gchpaco,,,"Because rebase, and rebase -i especially, gives you the ability to break your patches into discrete this-one-one-goddamn-thing patches (which is awkward in a ""oh, you committed it?  Then you committed it forever"" SCM like Perforce or SVN), you should do so.  It makes it a lot easier to review than the ""so this does X, but also fixes some syntax errors and adds logging"" style.  And that means you should make the patch comment reflect what it is doing.  Some errors here are inevitable but it's something to which I aspire.<p>Edit: to be a little clearer; your traditional SCM has a write-once-never-change model for the trunk of development.  This has a problem in a peer review situation, and the problem is this: I may go forth with the best of intentions to decompose things into discrete patches.  But when you get down to brass tacks, changes to the system tend to happen in any given order--you might discover a latent bug when testing your feature that has nothing to do with your feature.  Now you have two choices: you can wait and commit nothing until everything is great, which means you're not integrating with the mainline, which means that integrating will be incredibly painful, which leads to locks; or you commit as it comes in the moment, which is much better for integration and much easier to back out partial changes and generally get all of the non-backup elements of an SCM, but which is the very devil to peer review.  With rebase -i, it is quite easy to commit in the second style <i>in the moment</i> and then clean them up for peer review later; that is the ability to revise history means you can make decisions immediately without worrying that they will be cast in stone forever and ever anon.<p>I wasn't always this much of a hardliner on the subject, but my current job uses Perforce as the main SCM and I have realized that I disagree with almost every decision Perforce makes across the board.  I still use it, because any SCM is way better than no SCM and I don't want to explain git to everyone else, but my actual development occurs with git-p4.",1336815368

The parent poster is also giving bad advice in encouraging this guy to tell his former coworkers that he does not have the money for a lawyer/lawsuit.<p>I'm not a lawyer, but a bit of searching online suggests that the behavior of the company may be illegal in California under a law called ERISA (see the third bullet point under ""ERISA Violations"" on <a href=""http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/stock_option.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/stock_option.html</a>). The onus would presumably be on the employee to establish he was fired in order to avoid having his shares vest, but if the company had no other reason to be dissatisfied with his performance and never communicated any concerns before his termination he might have a case.<p>Personally, I think he should ask for his full year of equity and try exchanging equity for severance if they are reluctant. The thing to remember is that he might only have been on good terms with one of the founders, which means there are group dynamics to how any action he takes will be interpreted on their side.

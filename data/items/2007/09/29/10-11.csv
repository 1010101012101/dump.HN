Trying to control this system via computer controlled systems is a bit more demanding and rewarding at the same time.<p>Here's a translation of one of the above urls ...<p><pre><code>  For systematizing the motion skill, you think that \n  various sides such as body, sensing and processing \n  are important. Although it has the new sensing system, \n  as for the aforementioned robot, systemic tactual sense \n  with the form which is similar to the human, joint \n  structure was formed from the motor and harmonic drive, \n  the human was something which differs. \n\n  Also the robot of muscle skeletal type constitutes in \n  order to pursue the relationship between motion skill \n  and the body to a greater extent.\n\n  You aimed toward the fact that role of the body \n  because dynamic motion is actualized from the \n  viewpoint of ""the intelligence which had the body"", \n  via the development of the jump landing robot, is \n  made clear. Because jump landing is actualized with \n  the robot, the pneumatics artificial muscle actuator \n  was used, ""artificial muscle skeletal system"" was \n  proposed. You can call artificial muscle skeletal system \n  the thing which it tries probably to actualize the \n  mechanism which the animal has from standpoint of \n  living thing norm engineering.\n\n  The jump landing robot ""Mowgli"" which it developed \n  has anti- gravity muscle and 2 joint muscle which advance \n  as the mechanism which is peculiar to muscle skeletal \n  system. Depending upon kinetics simulation, even with \n  when there is a disturbance with the physical feedback of \n  muscle skeletal system robustness the fact that it can do \n  the vertical jumping was shown. In addition, the vertical \n  jumping and the jumping riding to the chair were actualized \n  as a dynamic systemic operation. \n</code></pre>\nIn  perfect translated <i>""Japlish""</i>.

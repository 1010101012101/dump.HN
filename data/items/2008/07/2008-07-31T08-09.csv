I guess Paul Buchheit has tainted my view of Google (or maybe he's just more interested in recruiting for Friendfeed), but either way, Google being in VC just doesn't hold the same appeal as YC.",1217494430

If you've been overweight for 20 years, there may very well be nothing that you can do about it.<p>An interesting (but very difficult to conduct) study would be an investigation into this particular rubicon of flab. How fat can you become for how long before it is impossible to go back.",1217494088

From what I hear, this is no longer enough to keep their employees there, especially the ones who have already made their money from GOOG stock. I posit that this move is as much to address that as to change how they buy startups (they were already doing that a lot even without a formal VC arm)",1217493931

Sites that force you to use letters and numbers and have a minimum amount are so annoying.<p>Sorry, but your site isn't as important to me as it is to you. If I sign up, I probably don't care if someone gets my password, and I just want to use something short and memorable. I'm probably only signing up because I want to save state. You should be preventing dictionary attacks by exponentially increasing time delays between login attempts or locking a user name after a few fails anyway. I shouldn't need that secure of a password.<p>Those standards might be fine for a bank, but for 99.9% of web apps they're ludicrous.",1217493276

It will stop working when the values you send it divided by the count are smaller than the precision of floats on your system...<p>Actually depending on the values you give it it might preform a lot worse than the running sum version.",1217492772

That's a far more cooperative spirit than simply forking someone's project for your own purposes.<p>Also, if someone is going to take the time to go through the code after forking, they might feel like fixing any bugs or handling a few new feature requests while they're at it, especially for small, informal projects.",1217492386

They're launching a humongous national campaign in all forms of media, on which they'll probably spend more than the entire worth of Gerber.<p>I can't even find any info on this Gerber Real People (though I only tried searching for that) but my guess is they have little or no similarity.

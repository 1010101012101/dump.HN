1078633,comment,1078298,1078298,0,0,notaddicted,,,"Disagree.<p>Such discussion are pointless with a simplistic (undefined) notion of good. When you define what ""good"" is, then you can have a real discussion about ethics.<p>Once you define your value system (any inconsistencies? I hope not) then you can compute (probably with immense difficulty) whether something is good or bad within it.<p>If you are a consequentialist then you would evaluate the effects of ""censorship"" in both cases. If you are not then you may also wish to evaluate ""censorship"" itself, or the government's enforcement of copyright (calling this censorship is rhetorical obfuscation, communication designed to confuse the listener.)",1264535903
1078632,comment,1077754,1078062,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Ah, the Dunning-Kruger effect at its finest. :-)<p>Please ask yourself this: even if you do know 20-year-olds who have done impressive things, why would you think that such talented and/or hard-working people will not be able to achieve still more impressive things at 30, when they have roughly an order of magnitude more useful experience? What about at 40, when they have had time to see through several long-term projects?<p>Or look at it the other way around: do you really think none of the successful older developers today also contributed to volunteer projects during school, worked summer jobs, or tried a start-up straight out of college?<p>It is true that disruption of routine is sometimes important for the industry to make progress, but it says a lot that you chose the word ""dominated"". Our industry isn't ""dominated"" by disruption at all. On the contrary, it is dominated by people who make useful products, using untrendy but tried-and-tested tools and techniques, that get real work done.<p>Every now and then, something truly original or a genuinely creative application of an old idea comes along, and that can become a great success. But for every one of those, there are a lot of ideas that stink and go nowhere. And guess what? Many of those ideas come from the young people who are convinced they're on a winner, because they are too inexperienced to know better, where more experienced developers might have seen similar ideas fail before and know an idea was doomed before wasting any time on it. Conversely, despite your rather odd assertion that broader experience somehow implies being set in one's ways, IME those who have been around for a while are much better at spotting opportunities to fill useful niches or change the rules in a significant way, and are much better at making practical, pragmatic decisions to take advantage of those opportunities.<p>YMMV, but I'd bet a substantial chunk of money that in ten years' time, you'll be on my side of the argument. :-)",1264535870

The issue is not how easy this was to do; even if she had to tediously carve the tracks into vinyl records with a fork, her punishment would be no less shocking.

1078582,comment,1078298,1078298,0,0,grellas,,,"No individual or private party can ""force"" anything off the internet unless that person has the force of law behind its otherwise private action.<p>The communist system of law is undergirded by a philosophy that assumes humankind can be reshaped and reorganized to achieve a collective goal for society that ultimately is ushered in by force. That is why freedom is lacking in such societies. One can be completely cynical about this and point to the way such societies have historically degenerated into slave camps but there is actually a form of ""idealism"" at work here, to wit, a view of humanity that says we can be molded from scratch to conform to a model of state government that enforces state ownership, state education, and state dictates as the central components of life, presumably to the betterment of society. Inexorably linked with this philosophy of the state is the idea that those who are being molded and shaped toward the ultimate goal will be exposed to and accept the ideas that animate this system and will not deviate from those ideas. A collective effort requires a collective will and there is little room for diversity of ideas when everything in society is shaped and directed by a centralized authority toward a common goal. Hence, it is natural and logical for a communist government such as that found in China to suppress all ideas that conflict with the idealized view of humanity that this government is currently forcing down the throats of its citizens. Law is law, and it is backed by fines/imprisonment/executions, etc. that enable a central governmental authority to use force to realize its will. If that centralized will is aimed at the strictest control over the most minute lives of its citizens - as it typically is in a communist system - there is no room for freedom of expression or for any beliefs or ideas that deviate from the narrow range of ideas that are deemed acceptable by those controlling the instruments of force in such a society.<p>In contrast, the western system of government, which generally is based on the ideas of capitalism and freedom, tends to be animated by a philosophy that sees citizens as being free to follow their diverse pursuits, goals, and dreams. This system is not anarchistic - government plays a crucial role here. But it is a role where the force of law is used to set up an infrastructure of private property and private rights where human freedom can flourish (in the ideal case, it being the case that no such system has yet been implemented without even flagrant flaws in it). Law, and the force it involves, is essential to such a system. If I have an exclusive right to own and occupy my home, this means that I have the right to exclude you from it - and, if you try to trespass, or to break and enter with the intent to steal, I can invoke the force of law to sue you in a private legal action that ultimately is backed by a sheriff ready, willing, and able to enforce collection of money judgments and also by police officers who will arrest you, courts that will try you, and jailers who will incarcerate you for your transgression. Force, or the threat of force, is behind any such system and, without this, the system could not work. Yet that force is limited by the philosophy that underlies our system - to wit, that the best government is not one that can use unlimited force without restraint on its actions but rather one that is checked, balanced, and restricted by things such constitutions that set the ultimate rules and that bind and limit all governing authorities. Without this philosophy, these constitutions would be the mere pieces of paper that they amount to in communist systems. With them, the shared values of society are realized, the governmental systems are checked while still enforcing an infrastructure that supports freedom, and we realize the fruits of enjoying a comparatively free flow of ideas, beliefs, and other information, along with all the other freedoms that we take for granted.<p>The Disney example is one of the force of law being used to enforce private property rights - in this case, the exclusive rights Disney may have to its intellectual properties. Though IP is intangible, and constitutes what might often be called information, it is nonetheless a form of private property that is under the exclusive ownership and control of whoever owns it. And, as with other forms of private property, the law stands behind it ready to apply force to protect the rights society may value in such forms of private property. Though enforcement of such rights is by force of law, and though (at this level) our system has a shared trait with a communist system that also uses the force of law to enforce its dictates, this system of private property has nothing fundamental in common with that of a communist system - indeed, it is the very antithesis of such a system. The one promotes and protects the individual and private parties as ends in themselves by using an organized system of government designed precisely for that purpose. The other (ideally) promotes and protects the interests of individuals and private parties by using an organized system of government whose goal is to enforce mass conformity to the declared purpose of the state to reshape humanity based on a collective means of ownership.<p>Of course, one can take issue with whether IP constitutes a legitimate form of private property that should be backed by the force of law. The various aspects of that debate can and should be argued by the citizens of a free society. But it is not legitimate to suggest that IP takes on a bad odor simply because it shares a superficial and incidental element (that the force of law ultimately restricts an otherwise unrestricted free flow of information) with a communist system of government. A government can censor and suppress ideas in ways that stop all free debate and that ultimately can transform a free society into a tyrannical one. That is what China does. A government does not ""censor"" ideas and information by declaring that a private individual or entity has an exclusive right to exploit the IP it has created, even though this has the incidental effect of limiting who can use that IP as long as it remains owned by that party.<p>Thus, the two cases could not be more different, and the word ""censor"" hardly makes them identical or even similar in any material respect.",1264534982

As political scientists see things, the fundamental role of government is to maintain a monopoly on the use of force.<p>We distinguish liberal democracies from other governments based on how they distribute the authority to use force. Liberal democracies are systems designed to treat each citizen as equal. We treat factors that oppose this equality as bugs[1]. We build subsystems that permit transfer of this authority without the use of force.<p>Both democracies and other governments use force to maintain their monopoly on force. (Though democracies tend not to need to use it as much.) The difference is that democracies use this force with authority that was freely given to them.<p>Copyright was created in the belief that it would increase the wealth of a society. It is enforced with authority. If a majority of the population felt strongly that it wasn't working properly, there is a mechanism for changing it that does not involve the use of force. We treat factors that interfere with this mechanism, such as corporate sponsorship of politicians, as bugs.<p>Censorship by government is a kind of force designed to preserve the monopoly on force. Copyright is not an exercise of power, censorship is. The use of power involved in enforcing copyright isn't designed to preserve the power itself. (Disney doesn't run the police yet.) Finally, if the citizens of a liberal democracy doesn't like censorship, they can elect a new government that does away with it. Citizens under other forms of government have no such recourse.<p>Moral relativism gets my heckles up.<p>[1]: Newspapers are our bug tracker, and an unsolved problem is to figure out how to build a new bug tracker.",1264534740

If we didn't give Disney exclusive control over Some Random Princess (TM), then they will be less incentivized to develop the Next Random Princess, since their expected profits from creating Next Random Princess is much lower when anyone can make a movie about Next Random Princess.  However, we like having movies with interesting characters, and we would like  companies like Disney (as well as many other companies) to create interesting characters for our enjoyment.  So we increase the profit motive for them by giving them exclusive control.  We believe that the creation of new intellectual property outweighs the value of having free access to existing intellectual property.<p>With a government body, incentivization doesn't really make any sense, since there aren't competing governing organizations.  Instead, we want our governments to be as open as possible, because we can only have one government, so we want to be able to criticize and influence the way it works.

Frankly, even great interfaces aren't so fast that it's worth the time for most doctors to navigate the UI to bring up a patient's file himself.  Nurses move, but doctors move more, their waste is more expensive and their frustration/errors more dangerous.<p>5. battery and connectivity issues are less a problem in nurse-centric scenarios and a non-issue for place-centric.<p>6. think of it as a replacement for the ever-present clipboards and physical files.

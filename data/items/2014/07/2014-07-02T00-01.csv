With amplifiers the sound is a little better, but not worth the inconvenience. For mid to low impedance headphones, amplifiers are often used to improve sound quality, not volume.

If measured ability follows a normal distribution then the farther out you go the more spread out (on average) individuals become.  For example, draw a billion samples from the right half of a normal distribution with mean 0 and stddev 1.  There will be more drawn between 4 and 5 than between 5 and 6.  The extreme outliers will be in some sense more lonely.<p>Edit: here are the most extreme values from a run of a billion draw with the distance to the next smallest value.<p>5.967211966\t0.056293894<p>5.910918072\t0.043174783<p>5.867743289\t0.081026984<p>5.786716305\t0.043416671<p>5.743299634\t0.094533593<p>5.648766041\t0.000088773<p>5.648737164\t0.005932669<p>5.642804495\t0.011669773<p>5.631134722\t0.003206244<p>5.627928478\t0.004643796<p>5.623284683\t0.013723654<p>5.609561028\t0.014653298<p>5.59490773\t0.018714748<p>5.576192982\t0.001690759<p>5.574502223\t0.031026791<p>5.543475432\t0.002331827<p>5.541143605\t0.022237834<p>5.51890577\t0.004242771<p>5.514662999\t0.009347961<p>5.505315038\t0.004298492<p>5.501016547\t0.02271157",1404260782

Like creating a map function that works directly on List, Array, and Set - but without using any common interface. Pretty neat, but it emits the function&#x27;s IL into every callsite so it can get out of hand.<p>I recall there being a mailing list thread on Go where the designers addressed this.

Only new travel generates economic benefits, so people who argue that new roads induce new travel are actually arguing that new roads create economic benefits.<p>If congestion is the issue, then–as Mann briefly mentions–the solution is congestion pricing. But Mann doesn’t understand the difference between true congestion pricing and New York City’s proposal for cordon pricing. Cordon pricing is more a way of raising revenue to fund urban boondoggles than a way of relieving congestion.<p>Even UC Berkeley planning professor Robert Cervero believes that the induced demand argument is “wrong headed.” “Road investments by themselves do not increase volumes,” he writes. “Only by conferring a benefit, like faster speeds, will traffic increase.” Provided that benefit is greater than the cost–something that could be assured, Cervero says, through proper pricing of roads–then it is a good thing.&quot;",1404260545

If the function is f = t, where t is time, then f will give different results on Wed and Fri.<p>I assume you meant something like f(t) = t?<p>If so, then right, if you pass in the current time as a parameter to the function, then the result can depend on it.  But in Python, you don&#x27;t pass in the current time.  That&#x27;s because &quot;function&quot; means something entirely different in Python.<p>In math, at the simplest possible level [1], a function is a set of ordered pairs, with the property that no two different ordered pairs have the same first element.  That&#x27;s all there is to it.  So when I write f(x) = 3x - 5, that&#x27;s just shorthand for saying that f is the infinite set { (0, -5), (1, -2), (2, 1), (1/2, -7/2), ...}.  That&#x27;s all there is to it.  There&#x27;s no sequences of operations, no process, etc.  It&#x27;s just a set of ordered pairs.<p>Python&#x27;s functions, on the other hand, are at their core a sequence of instructions.  Some of those instructions (like loops or conditionals) have other sequences of instructions as components.  They share an environment, which consists of storage locations called local variables.  A Python function is actually a pretty complex thing, when you get down to it.<p>You could <i>model</i> Python&#x27;s functions using standard mathematics, if you play some tricks: add hidden parameters, give interpretations to the results in terms of physical effects, etc.  But this just tells you that math is powerful enough to model Python functions (and, well, anything else) in terms of its much simpler ideas.  It doesn&#x27;t mean that those ideas are the same as the things in Python that go by the same name.<p>> For example, I can build a graph of a parabola in Python. The way my code does it is pretty much the same as if I did it by hand with a pencil: I assign multiple values to x, and find corresponding values for y.<p>Okay, but you&#x27;re describing the process of drawing the parabola.  In math, f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1 isn&#x27;t a <i>process</i> for drawing a parabola.  It <i>is</i> a parabola.  So f, here, <i>is</i> itself the set of ordered pairs, which make up a parabola if you treat them as points on the coordinate place.  That&#x27;s the basic difference.<p>[1] Okay, for the pedants out there, this depends on your choice of foundations.  I&#x27;m assuming the standard interpretation using ZFC, but a similar point would apply if you prefer a different foundational theory.",1404259885

7974309,comment,7972015,7973216,2,0,lcrs,,,"I&#x27;ve heard two explanations for this.  The first is that the longer wavelength &quot;red&quot;-ish receptors in our eyes are also excited by the frequencies of light at the other end of the visible spectrum, so shorter wavelengths than blue start to appear red again.  Unfortunately the graph produced to back this up is usually that of the CIE colour matching functions, which do indeed have an obvious lump around purple, but are <i>not</i> derived from measurements. That lump was added to create a three-primary space which didn&#x27;t require negative numbers to encode completely pure single-wavelength colours. That&#x27;s a problem which otherwise crops up when you use three primaries based directly on measurements of the eye, because the three pigments in our eyes are not selective enough that a single wavelength only activates one receptor.  Real measurements of the pigments don&#x27;t really back up the idea of extra sensitivity to purple in the long-wavelength cones.<p>The second explanation (or suggestion, at least) is more psychological.  In the distant past our eyes had only two colour receptors, and our brains measured the relative difference between the two, so we percieved colour on a one-dimensional line - e.g. more &quot;warm&quot; long wavelengths or more &quot;cool&quot; short wavelengths.  At some point we evolved a third receptor, and our brains began processing this extra input as another perceptual axis orthogonal to the existing one, which could be described as purple/green against the original red/blue.  Exploring this new 2D space results in a continuous rainbow around the edges.",1404259732

4545,comment,4544,4544,0,0,ynot,,,"This morning, I thought of an experiment. Some Marketing-Freaks tell you ""If you want people to do something, tell them they are not able or not allowed to do it"". For example a very popular ad in Germany for a fashion company just showed some fashion and only 2 words: ""Sorry, expensive.""<p>So I thought it could be interesting to try this here and post an entry ""Don't vote this post up"". Let's see, how it performs.",1174033195

I'm all about progress as long as it actually progresses something and isn't just about doing it differently. Offline further complicates it, even indicating a greater integration of technology into the most ephemeral of daily activities. ",1174032524

4538,comment,4509,4509,0,0,danielha,,,"It was brought up in a past discussion that TechStars are not exclusively seeding-stage and have close ties to VCs, which is something to be very wary about. If you take a look at their application, it's near-idenical to Y Comb's. If they can't be bothered to write their own _app_, I'm not convinced that their program is anywhere near well thought-out.<p>Plus, YC understands young hackers and the startup community like no other group of individuals I've ever come across. We're solely focused on applying to them as far as seed funding goes.",1174032131

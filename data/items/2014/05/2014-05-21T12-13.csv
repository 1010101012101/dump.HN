7777884,comment,7776074,7776881,2,0,VLM,,,"&quot;Keeping them alive is inefficient for the species.&quot;<p>A lot of that is based on the idea of a nuclear American 1950s family, mom dad and 2.5 kids in a house and grannie lives in Florida 1000 miles away.<p>More likely, if I lived for 1000 years I&#x27;d spend a lot of time ensuring the economic success of my descendants by teaching programming, electronics, maybe math unless a better mathematician comes along.  If this situation existed in the past, I have a GGGGG-uncle (cousin?) who was a Harvard literature prof in the early 1800s and I&#x27;m sure he would have taken a decade out of his semi-eternal life to educate me on English lit and related topics.  I have some GGGG-Uncles who were in the civil war and fought in Tennessee, surely their personal experiences would have more impact than merely reading a book.<p>This has certain economic and evolutionary effects, such that a &quot;migrant farm harvesting laborer&quot; not allowed to ever benefit from his own labor, would not be able to help his GGGG-grandkids in any obvious way.  So some kids are going to grow up with 16 hours a day of continuous one on one academic tutoring from a team of perhaps a dozen PHD ancestors, while other kids are going to grow up basically playing video games, or at best, watching youtube videos.<p>Its an obvious sci-fi topic to explore the nature vs nurture question.  A permanent overclass would likely develop based solely on ancestry (indirectly &quot;nature&quot; although in practice &quot;nurture&quot;)<p>This is aside from obvious social interaction.  Locally I know a lot of the people in my field, and a descendent going into my line of work could be financially (aka reproductively) rewarded by hanging out with me and meeting people.  If I do nothing for a descendent other than socially introduce them to local hiring managers, that&#x27;s still genetically a net win.

I can&#x27;t speak for tptacek but can explain his comment. Lavabit may not have known about the legal possibilities, but the technical design was such that Lavabit could expose users&#x27; communications.<p>The technical shortcoming was that the system used the password input by the user as a key for the encryption. I may have some details mixed up, but basically they could capture the password in plaintext and unlock the user&#x27;s comms with it.

7777867,comment,7777323,7777638,2,0,brudgers,,,"To me, right now, I think the core difference between Clojure and other Lisps is Clojure gets rid of memory management. Yes, other Lisps have automatic deallocation, but the fundamental constructor, `cons`, is a raw memory allocation. It`s `malloc`for linked rather than sequential memory.<p>Although Clojure still has a `cons` it has been replaced by `seq` as the fundamental abstraction. Clojure takes advantage of being  fully managed code and in a sense is as much a Lisp as C# is a C [if we were inclined to think of C as a genre, else Algol?].<p>It seems this, combined with a formally incorporating a DSL of the kind a experienced Lisper (such as Hickey) might create for writing programs gives Clojure it&#x27;s syntax: e.g. [x y] is syntactically like a quoted list and writing a macro is the sort of thing hubris drives lazy impatient Lispers to do. In special forms [x y] is like a different more complex macro, but again the sort of thing people would write for themselves. In other Lisps the ad hoc nature of such macros however makes other people&#x27;s code notoriously hard to follow.",1400675885
7777866,comment,7774158,7776677,1,0,danielweber,,,"The fundamental rule is that the government is entitled to evidence.<p>If a church, for some insane reason, kept written records about what was said in the confessional, and a court order was somehow granted to order the church to turn over their records (ignoring privilege), they would need to turn those over.<p>If someone destroyed them, the DOJ would not need to shut down the church.  They would charge the person who destroyed them with the appropriate crime, and then everyone would move on.<p>If they refused to turn them over, but the DOJ believed they were still on premises, eventually the DOJ would get the local sheriff to physically enter the building and take the records.  There would be no need to shut down the church.<p>In that situation, ideally the records are all in individual files, and the constable only needs to take one.  If the head priest said &quot;nyah nyah, we mixed them all up, ha ha!&quot;, then all would be seized, and someone would need to go through and find the relevant information.<p>By keeping all the secrets of their &quot;clients&quot; written down, the church has put them all at risk.  If one priest knew the secret only in his head, the government could compel him to testify, and that still wouldn&#x27;t require shutting down the church.<p>The nature of computers is that they are simultaneously typewriter, gold bars, and file cabinet -- they are needed for work, they are valuable, they contain lots of information.  When the government needs to seize evidence, they cannot slice out the &quot;file cabinet&quot; component from the other components.  The fundamental rule is that the government is entitled to evidence.<p><i>EDIT, and maybe this is what I should have said instead of all the stuff above</i>: Lavabit&#x27;s only defense against seizure of its keys if a court order demanded them was to refuse to provide them.  I.e., break the law.  I don&#x27;t know how else that can be read except as a promise to break the law on behalf of their clients.<p><i>Second edit</i>: And fundamentally an unkeepable promise.

7777820,comment,7777149,7777149,6,0,smoyer,,,"Being a Java/JVM expert, I wanted to add a couple of thoughts to your process.  I&#x27;m not insinuating that you should change anything you&#x27;ve done!<p>- Dropping JBoss Seam as a framework was a good choice because the important parts of Seam have been added to the JavaEE system, which provides an end-to-end set of technology specifications.  If you choose to run a Java Application Server (such as JBoss EAP, Glassfish or Wildfly), then the server will support the full set of specifications, but you don&#x27;t have to use them.  Since JavaServer Faces (JSF) is one of those specification, I&#x27;m not really surprised you hadn&#x27;t heard of it ... it&#x27;s essentially JSP with lifecycle control and data-binding.<p>- GWT is indeed a Java technology, but it produces client-side code.  For big projects, I generally use GWT with Bootstrap to generate the client.  It compiles into Javascript producing several versions optimized for different browser groups.  Using Martin Fowler&#x27;s Passive View pattern, it&#x27;s easy to write fast tests for your client-side business logic, and since it&#x27;s typesafe, you get compiler errors before the compilation to Javascript instead of the run-time errors you often see when writing in Javascript (or Coffeescript).  Since I generally write the back-end for a generic JavaEE server, I also tend to use REST calls from GWT to an Application Server for client-server communication.<p>- If you&#x27;re looking for an ORM, none of the Java frameworks will include one directly, but it should be pluggable.  When people talk about Java web frameworks, they&#x27;re often constrained to just the &quot;View&quot; tier.  Spring provides a much more full-featured stack (with DI and JPA) and is more analogous to JavaEE as a whole.  I think you should consider those two as the full-stack contenders in Java.  You can add GWT onto either if you need a client-side Java technology (I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d NEVER use Java Applets for the client side right?).<p>- I happen to like Scala and appreciate how purely it seems to add a syntax to Lambda calculus.  Martin Odersky&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Functional Programming in Scala&quot; on Coursera was a great class, but I&#x27;m hoping the Scala IDE advances quickly.  I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;ve never written production software in Scala (or using WAVE) but I also admire one project that&#x27;s using it successfully (<a href=""https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket</a>).",1400675421

7777805,comment,7772557,7774771,6,0,gjm11,,,"Actually, <i>that very example</i> struck me as an instance of style over substance. Football, cricket, baseball, sprinting, javelin throwing: these are all diversions of the field, for sure. But <i>canoeing</i>? Have both McPhee and Somers forgotten that canoeing is done in a canoe, and canoes don&#x27;t work very well on grass?<p>Yes, indeed, &quot;a diversion of the field&quot; sounds nice. The words have a pleasant ring to them. But they are, as it happens, completely inapplicable to canoeing.<p>Perhaps McPhee or Somers or both would consider this mere pedantry, worthy only of technical writing. I dare to suggest that their heroes Webster and Johnson would disagree.<p>I have to say that the paragraph about the canoeing strikes me as wrongheaded in another respect. &quot;Simply a rite of oneness with certain terrain&quot;, writes McPhee. Wait, what? <i>Simply</i>? In what hierarchy of value or complexity or whatever it is that &quot;simply&quot; indicates a lack of does getting efficiently from A to B rank above a &quot;rite of oneness&quot; with the terrain in between?<p>Furthermore, let&#x27;s return to Webster&#x27;s definition of &quot;fustian&quot;, which he defines as &quot;a kind of writing in which high-sounding words are used, above the dignity of the thoughts or subject&quot;. The subject, in this case, is the fact that people take canoeing trips for reasons other than efficient travel. Fair enough; worth pointing out, in its context; but it&#x27;s a pretty good example of a subject that doesn&#x27;t demand &quot;high-sounding words&quot;.<p>(I have to say that I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that what determines the appropriateness of high-sounding words is the dignity of the thoughts or subject. In -- for instance -- a religious ritual, a national celebration, or a musical performance, high-sounding words might be appropriate even for rather unexciting thoughts. Make it &quot;the dignity of the thoughts, subject, and occasion&quot; and I&#x27;d agree. So maybe there&#x27;s something about McPhee&#x27;s piece that makes elevated language appropriate even for its mundane topic. But I would prefer the elevation of the language not to compromise its meaning, which it has in this case.)",1400675224

Tesla&#x27;s superchargers are the world&#x27;s highest-capacity quick charging at 130kW, 2x the nearest competitor (CHAdeMO). And this still requires ~one hour to give the battery a full charge. Let&#x27;s say you want to be able to charge in six minutes. That would mean something on the order of 1.3MW of electric power. So let&#x27;s say you have a small-ish refueling station like a contemporary gas station, with eight charging spots. To power these, you need to pull ten megawatts from somewhere. The current power grid isn&#x27;t dimensioned for this kind of demand, especially since the demand is very transient.<p>Tesla is attempting to solve this by building a massive battery storage capacity into the chargers and then trickle charging these batteries when the charging bays are not in use, so this is by no means a problem that has been solved once and for all.",1400673744

You can fix your branch out for better performance at the cost of more wasted space. You will never be as fast as an array.<p>Also, sometimes you want your updates to a data structure to be seen via an alias (happens often actually), then we are back at square one again.<p>Systems people are much more pragmatic about this: they see the trends in hardware before we PL people do, and their solution has never been functional programming. Ok, well...maybe once with MapReduce (but Jeff and Sanjay are both systems PL people).",1400673629

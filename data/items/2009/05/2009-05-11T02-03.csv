Create product on the side while working for someone OR move back to Canada and work on it full-time<p>2. Start an LLC (non-US citizens can do this, and C-corps)<p>3. Raise money or become profitable (actual amount varies, some say $200k or more)<p>4. Find a business co-founder and other employees<p>5.

I don't know anything about those so cannot comment on them further.<p>However, the US has the E-2 Treaty Investor visa for situations like this - see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-2_visa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-2_visa</a> and  <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1273.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1273.html</a> .. Canada is a treaty signatory. There's quite a lot to it, but essentially it allows you to enter and work within the US to control an investment. Investment must be ""significant"" with respect to the sort of business it is (so if you were opening a steel mill, $200k probably wouldn't cut it, but a software company? Theoretically it could be as little as $100k). There was a post linked from HN recently about a British group of guys who used the E-2 successfully to set up a company in the Bay Area.<p>Alternatively, you could work on your company in Canada for a period of a couple of years then open a US branch/subsidary and transfer to it through an L visa.<p>The short story, though, is that it's really, really hard and generally rather expensive, unless you have access to some Canadian focused visa class I'm not aware of. Going to work at an established American company is not particularly hard (assuming you have a degree) but anything beyond that involves a great deal of pain. I've been investigating moving to the US as a self employed person for about six years now and am still not close to discovering a good route (with ""save $250k in cash"" as my current, tricky to attain fallback position).",1242010442

So bring in the top officials from Singapore, put them on an independent commission to redesign the healthcare system, and force Congress to pass exactly  the plan they come up with.<p>Read more about Singapore's healthcare system here:

If you approach the problem from the perspective of a hypothetical policy advisor, there is very little that is both a) politically possible and b) would actually improve the system.  Raising the caps on medical school enrollment is an obvious fix that would reduce costs without costing taxpayers anything, but the doctors will try their hardest to block it.  A mandate to buy insurance makes sense in theory, but in practice the required level of healthcare to buy gets set way, way, too high, and so a mandate ends up being a huge transfer from citizens to the healthcare industry.  There are dozens of other examples.  Our system is f<i></i>*ed up for a reason, and until the political system is reformed, policy reform is impossible.<p>In reality, healthcare spending will continue to rise until it simply cannot rise further.  The spending will be distributed according to political power.",1242010353

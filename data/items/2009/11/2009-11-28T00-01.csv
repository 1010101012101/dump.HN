It's unfortunate for the scientific debate. The level of discourse has dropped dramatically because of the politicisation.<p>On the other hand, scientists have been researching this for many years. The scientific debate has been ongoing for at least that long. Their conclusions do have a strong effect on policy. Political decisions have to be made about how to handle the issue.[1] Such policy-making has already started years ago and lead to the Kyoto Accord in 1997. So we're more in the political phase than we are in the scientific phase. 90% politics is probably as it should be right now.<p>[1] You can read this as ""how to handle the issue if at there is an issue"" if you want.

I have many coworkers with families, and I completely agree that family should come first. However, why should it be taboo for a business to recognize the difference between the career-driven and the family-driven employees, regardless of their gender? If I'm willing to sacrifice a few weekends here and there for a project's success, isn't that worth something? If a position requires a higher level of dedication, is it that bad for a business to screen out those they know have family obligations that will prevent them from putting in the extra effort? I think many businesses do this informally right now, but why should it be a questionable thing to recognize? Some tasks are a better fit for less-rounded individuals.",1259368728
964594,comment,964506,964506,0,0,justrudd,,,"I worked at Amazon for a while.  And the only thing I can tell you is that unless someone replies that specifically works in the group you are talking to any specific advice or questions they give you would be mildly useful.  Every group has different hiring bars and questions (some groups use the same script for every applicant so they can be ranked next to each other.  My group never did this).<p>advice on questions?  Coding, algorithmic complexity, and design.  You will probably have to write code during the call.  Depending on the screener, it could be e-mailed in a couple of hours after the screen.<p>A lot screeners tend to combine coding and algorithmic complexity in one question.  They'll give you a question with an obvious quadratic solution and a less obvious linear or logarithmic solution (or even more rare a constant solution).<p>When you are refining your algorithm - talk.  Talk about the variables and what'd you name them.  Talk about why the nested for loop isn't good.  Talk about everything you are thinking of.  The whole point of the screen is to get an idea about how you solve problems.<p>If there is a way to solve the problem using a standard library, mention it.  You'll be told you can't do it that way, but it is good for a screener to hear that you know how to use a standard library to solve the problem.  I used to give points for this even if they missed implementing the algorithm themselves.<p>Language tends not to be a big deal.  I would let applicants use Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, etc.  Whatever they were most familiar with was OK with me.  I'll be honest, my group used to give preference to C++.  C++ is a harder language to master than Java.  so someone that gives a good C++ answer, usually got the edge over the Java guy.  Again this was my group where 90% of the code was already in C++.<p>If you say you know C or C++ and can't see how pointers could be used to solve the coding problem you are given (especially if a string manipulation question), that would be a huge red flag for us.<p>Design questions can run the gamut.  I used to ask ""design a reservation system for restaurant"", ""design a parking lot"", etc.  Simple things that everyone knows.  The design would include what objects you have, how they interact, data structures, etc.  I'd look for whether you treated classes as data containers or you believed in data + behavior.<p>And finally, don't forget that Amazon is about getting stuff done.  That means your solution may be a perl script slicing some data and piping the result through cut, sort, uniq, etc.  Don't assume you've got to write a program from scratch to solve every problem.<p>Good luck!",1259368660

Reporting leaks based on mismatched alloc/dealloc system calls is a fair starting point, but is still a naive technique.<p>For example detecting resource leaks can either be done by instrumenting the program itself, or tracking calls to the underlying OS routines. If the tracking was based on the program then everything would be peachy since the create/free calls match. But it's not, it uses system calls and seemingly discounts the potential for resources not to live beyond their use in the program. And that's naive.<p>>> Any sufficiently advanced cache is indistinguishable from a memory leak, that's sort of the point. <<<p>I suppose that depends on your definition of a leak.

The old job is guaranteed on the mother's return.  The woman must also have worked at the company for at least one year.  Moreover, companies with less than 50 employees are exempt from this law so most startups are not bound.<p>I don't find this law unreasonable.",1259366733

No pretenses about full generality are being made. ""Some caches confuse some memory leak detection tools"" may be more accurate, but it's hardly catchy.<p>Also, analysis is only as good as what you know to analyse. Calling a memory analysis ""naive"" because it bases itself only on the system allocation/deallocation routines (which are, after all, the logical starting point for any such analysis) is just silly. Sure, the analyzer could have been extended to know about BSTR caching, but there's obviously no limit to the amount of cleverness you need to build in to properly analyze everything this way. Any sufficiently advanced cache is indistinguishable from a memory leak, that's sort of the point.",1259366641

I guess another solution would be to require employees to put up a bond that covers the companies expenses in case they go on absence.  The cost of a risk of absence has to be paid by out of the gross salary anyway, so we might as well make it more explicit.<p>(I do not know whether you could then put up a (possibly subsidisied) insurance company to cover the bonds in case of having children.  The problem is, that having children does not work like accidents or fire.)",1259366486

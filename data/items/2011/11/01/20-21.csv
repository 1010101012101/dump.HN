Certainly the number of people required to dig a ditch has plummeted over the last 200 years.  A few skiploader drivers can do the work of thousands.  As robots get cheaper and more capable, it's not too hard to imagine a future where humans stop doing purely physical jobs entirely.<p>I also think the thesis of ""everyone should be respected"" is inconsistent with the thesis of ""education is good"".  If knowledge and education is good, then lack thereof is inherently not-good.  This doesn't mean you should spit on the binman, but it does mean you will probably steer your kids away from that career path.",1320181181

It's amazing when you speak to datacentre people and they tell you how much of your server charges go on electricity and cooling. My recent example was £200 extra/year for an additional Opteron 6128 and £400 extra/year for the increased power usage from that processor!<p>There is an obvious gap in the market for low power, low heat generating, high memory throughput server processors.

For a company to regularly outsource their jobs to the ""smartest person"" means that all the other ""smart but not smart enough people"" are without a job. So long as those other people are still able to find regular employment (i.e., exist within the traditional model), they'll do that, leaving fewer and fewer people available in the crowdsourcing pool.<p>2. <i></i>Quality of job seekers.<i></i> While it's true that in a meritocracy, the best rise to the top, this works best in a fairly small environment. If the entire ecosystem of web developers was required to compete for every single job, and anyone seeking a developer had only the entire ecosystem to look through, finding an ""appropriate match"" would become far too daunting, and the employers would be forced to reduce the rigor with which they vetted potential employees. This allows weaker candidates to get potentially good jobs. As a result, the more qualified candidates leave, and the meritocracy system is ruined.",1320181073

3184106,comment,3183276,3183811,13,0,antirez,,,"Hi cperciva, I actually think that comments are not a so important part of code quality. I tend to add comments where my code risks to be not clear by itself, and the zipmap.c code is indeed more commented than my average code since it is all about encoding stuff in a binary blob string, playing with pointers, and so forth. So actually too much comments may even be a sign that something is bad about the code.<p>IMHO good code should be readable since the purpose of different files, functions, statements, data structures, should be obvious (at different levels of course), and every time it is not obvious there should be a comment helping the reader to understand what is going on.<p>My idea is that programmers with time develop a feeling about when a comment is needed. For instance a comment is needed all the times you are writing something that avoids a specific problem but you'll likely not remember why it was needed in a few weeks. Other times comments are useful since the flow of the function is complex and there is no easy way to refactor it into many pieces, so comments help to organize the function in smaller conceptual parts, and so forth.<p>There is no absolute rule, but the reality is that IMHO the test is simple to do for external people: good code is easy to understand and modify without being an expert of that code base.<p>This topic is a good idea for a blog post, since I thought a lot about this issues lately. For instance if you want a place in Redis where code should be improved is in the handling of blocking operations: there are a few things in that code that are absolutely non obvious even adding comments, and you either are a lot ""into it"" or you'll not have an easy time understanding it. I'm planning a refactoring of that piece of code.",1320181010

Instead, we have ""business method patents,"" which cover the systems and methods used by the software in conjunction with an operating environment that are putatively novel, non-obvious, unique, and enabled.<p>I'd imagine most people fall into two camps: (1) business methods shouldn't be patentable subject matter solely because they satisfy the machine-or-transformation test (as articulated in a trilogy of cases from the 1970s and most recent in Bilski); and (2) even if they should be, many of the business methods today fail on non-obviousness grounds.<p>Proscribing the issuance of 'software patents' <i>isn't</i> the problem. The problem is that in this digital age, we're relying on the machine-or-transformation test for business practices that exist in the virtual world.

3184039,comment,3183855,3183855,19,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Concept videos are ill-founded in general. Indeed, I'd say it's better to have a vague, handwaving long-term goal than a crisp, sharply focused, highly detailed concept like these videos. The basic fallacy at play is the idea that it's possible to predict the future so far in advance. In reality this is only possible if your products are boring and mundane. When you make products that transform people's lives and the way the world works then it becomes impossible to predict how people will use them and how society, industry, and the economy will change as a consequence. That's true even from generation to generation of a device or piece of software, making it utterly useless to try to predict anything several generations ahead.<p>Worse yet, concept videos make it all too easy to fall into the trap of working to make a product that looks cool in a demo but in reality is either hugely impractical to make or use or simply not very useful. For example, you could make a demo video of people commuting to and from work via rocket powered skateboard. And it would look <i>awesome</i>, and after watching the video everyone would want to commute to work via rocket powered skateboard. But in reality it's not practical, and possibly not even as fun as it may seem (after the first 100 times the novelty would wear off, and then you're just riding a death trap and getting rained on and stuck in rocket-powered-skateboard traffic ... ok, it still sounds awesome, nevertheless...).<p>When you skip so many intermediate steps you can generate a false sense of what's possible, or even mislead yourself on what you're working on. Eventually smartphones are going to have no bezel and be super thin, so what? That's cool, but what does it have to do with what you are doing in the mean time to make smartphones better? It's easy to make a demo about voice control but the hard part is making it work in the here and now, how do you do that?",1320180079

It also forces you to do lots of maintenance work with instances, ips, snapshots, etc - you can do it clicking in the web console but still <i>you have to do it</i>; so you basically buy an illusion of less work and a hardware of nightmarish parameters.<p>I'd say: buy a two dedicated server plans for your dev/CI machine and production (dedicated, yeah, no VMs!), pay a fellow admin some booze to make a magic on it once and you're done for a year. Even if your startup is successful (which I wish you from a deepest heart but remember the statistics are against you) a decent under-$100 plan will be enough [1] for you for the first year or two and you'll see the symptoms of increased resource usage soon enough to rethink the infrastructure. After that time - if your startup survives - you'll call fellow admin again to re-measure the usage, make some prediction and configure some horiz scaling for you. And you still will go cheaper than with EC2.<p>Other sane approach would be to have production on a dedicated server and put your development on some good PaaS like Heroku, but I warn you - you will be quickly excessing a free plan, so it won't be a most cheap option.<p>A general rule: cloud server or platform price is 150%-500% of a dedicated server with similar hardware. Why overpay when you're small?<p>And YES, I'm using EC2 since its start. It sucked badly at its infancy and sucks worse.\nAnd YES, I'm not against the cloud because of some bitterness caused by my corporation which hosts everything in house, but I cofounded and delivered to production a successful (yet) startup.

However, it does solve the problem cperciva mentioned in the comment I replied to: ""If you stick to declaring all your variables in one place, it's much easier to notice when you've already used a variable name."".  -Wshadow detects when you've already used a variable name and reports that as a warning (or an error if you use -Werror, which you should).<p>I also agree about declaring a variable in the narrowest scope that makes sense.  I often see code that attempts to reuse the same variable for several different purposes, rather than declaring separate variables in narrower scopes.",1320177712

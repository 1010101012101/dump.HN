Legal minds far more capable than mine would design a set of rules and options that would make this a true resource and, to use the term again, a ""nuclear option"" against trolls.

Perhaps, if it'd work better legally, some system that encrypts the audio on the fly, with a public half of a keypair where the private key is held by an organisation who never gets the encrypted file, and who will only turn the key over to a lawyer or court?

4205631,comment,4204728,4204728,5,0,teamonkey,,,"I studied Kanban, as it applies to manufacturing, some time ago. I have no idea how it could apply to software development. It seems a poor fit for it.<p>Kanban is not a queueing system, it is a system for identifying bottlenecks in a supply chain and at all times minimising the amount of components that need to be manufactured. One of the key revolutionary features was that the supply chain extends to each component so different departments become suppliers to others.<p>What typically happens is that there are a certain number of kanban cards for each component. Each card represents one component. When a client takes a completed component from the stock, the associated kanban card goes to the start of the queue. Someone picks up the card and starts work on the component and the card follows the manufacturing process until the component has been completed. The card stays with the completed component until a client takes the component and the cycle begins again.<p>The purpose is that by counting the number of cards at the start (number of items requested by clients) and at the end (number of items constructed but not yet claimed by a client) it becomes trivial to identify bottlenecks.<p>Apart from this then-revolutionary pull-based process, Toyota's process had two other key findings.<p>1) the same worker should stay with each component until completion. One kanban card = 1 worker. If someone is assembling a car door, they don't half-complete a door and pass it on to someone else, they follow it from the time they pick up all the components to the time that it is completed. They found that this was the most productive way of working.<p>2) You do not deliver a faulty component to a client. That is, each component must be tested before going on to the next stage.",1341532580

Publishing, for instance.<p>What I'm saying is that the kanban strategy does not apply to software development. Full stop. Does not map. Not applicable. Completely unrelated. Irrelevant. Moot. Nonsensical. Like measuring feline happiness in banana units.<p>If my employer could effectively chunk my work into itty bitty little stickies, they wouldn't need me.<p>#2 - When have you seen a scrum iteration planned around the QA/test cycle? Never? The sprints are defined by PHBs, devs grudgingly play along, QA/test can just suck it.<p>A real QA/test org would say a product is done when its done. I've not seen that happen on any scrum project. Rather, products are done when they've run out of time or juice (eg Yourdon's death march).",1341532571

4205616,comment,4203443,4205302,2,0,asciilifeform,,,"Author of linked article speaking.<p>I dislike Clojure because it is a cheap knock-off of Common Lisp, with no upsides that I'm aware of - <i>besides trendiness.</i> The article mentions one serious flaw - Clojure barfs Java stack traces, instead of serious debug information (the way Common Lisp does - with <i>restarts</i>, etc.) Another flaw is the lack of reader macros. But what is the point of listing said flaws? I could go on and on, and no one will care a whit. Why? Because Clojure is a product of immature minds who piss on the past work of serious people (the Common Lisp community) simply for the sake of faux-novelty. In this, it resembles Newlisp and other backwards steps disguised as progress. It is, in fact, best understood as yet another product of the idiotic language-of-the-day mentality which gave us Dylan, Python, Ruby, and the many other shoddy ""infix Lisps.""<p><i>> hates all languages that aren't the Symbolics flavour of common lisp</i><p>This is patently untrue, as anyone who actually bothers to read my articles knows well.

So it does not look like any government conspiracy theory is required. Of course, if you have data proving otherwise, it would be interesting to look at it.<p>The courts in US regularly rule against big banks in various cases, so it is just plain wrong to claim judge will never rule against the bank. The SEC is more problematic, since high knowledge requirements for regulating banks and security industries leads very quickly to the situation when all SEC experts are industry people, and thus defend the industry interests. This is inevitable problem of state regulation - the only way to know what the industry does is to work there, and finding somebody that is both impartial and competent is next to impossible. Yet even SEC regularly issues rulings against banks.<p>Of course, there's a lot of corruption is US, including the highest levels of government - so, former House Ways and Means Committee chair Charles Rangel was caught fraudulently evading taxes, getting huge donations from companies directly benefiting from rules he was promoting, taking lavish Caribbean trips paid by lobbyists, etc. He finally had to step down from the position and was censured by the Congress ethics committee, but still was reelected. So I think the problem here is the people that vote for corrupt officials as much as the corrupt officials themselves. If the people would refuse to vote for corruption, people like Rangel would not be able to persists in power for as long as they do now.",1341531326

You aren't going to connect a 3.5mm or TOSLINK output to a passive speaker, and you generally aren't going to connect speaker-level outputs to an RCA input. The only other competing connecter worth considering is plain old bare wire.<p>It has TOSLINK and HDMI outputs in addition; it's not an either/or choice.<p>As for the benefit of amplifier integration, I can think of a few:<p>- Space. The nice receivers you talk about are generally at least 17"" wide and 14"" deep, so if this is a bedroom or den setup for wireless music streaming you might not have space for one. Smaller ones obviously exist, but I haven't found one smaller than about 11"" by 13"" with remote volume control.<p>- Power consumption. Full receivers often have ridiculous idle power consumption, and the only standardized way to turn them off (HDMI-CEC) can still have significant standby power consumption. Also it uses a more efficient class D amp while most full receivers use class AB.<p>- Volume control. It should be between the DAC and amplifier, but with a two piece streaming + outboard receiver your options are either a separate remote to control it or digital volume control at the streamer, which really is suboptimal. And if you want a tiny amp then there is no remote; you have to get up and physically turn a knob.",1341531320

No one tells you what to do.<p>2. Fix bugs first. No one likes a backlog full of 132,423 bugs. Fix 'em as you find em.<p>3. Priority queue is decided by the whole team (with input from management) but is MACRO and has value goals associated with it (e.g. redesign signup - increase conversions 30%). Team figures out what that means, and measures it.<p>4. Features that don't ""move the needle"" (or moves it negatively) get yanked. Code has weight and tends to rust. If it doesn't meet the business goals but is showing positive reception (e.g. increased conversions at <i>all</i>) bias towards rework.<p>5. Only work on one thing at a time. This is super important. Don't have four or five stories ""in process"". Too much WIP = nothing gets done. If you are blocked on something, pull the andon cord and we can figure out what we need to do to fix it. Go read a book. Go for a walk. Do something other than starting another task.<p>6. Velocity helps us figure out what ""reasonable pace"" means. That's it. It's not used for long-range planning, just ""are we working at a sustainable pace?""<p>7. Frequent retrospectives (every two weeks) help us nudge the ship in the right direction. We evaluate our process and see what needs fixin', and make sure that promises made are not abandoned due to externalities (management interference, or other non-technical reasons).<p>8. Iteration planning is short and is only used to keep the team informed.<p>9. Use passive information radiators to communicate status and progress instead of meetings etc.",1341531052

If you don't understand what work's being done, you can't have any input, and can't improve things (one of the other points of Kanban).<p>Also, Kanban is a pull system, not push, so it works very differently to most methodologies. You can see it in some of the modern web companies like 37Signals, with their ""develop the HTML first"" mantra, as well as XP and TDD.<p>Kanban doesn't relate to testing at all as far as I know, but Scrum has their ""definition of done"", in that everything should be ready to ship when it's done.

Its supported by thousands of independent observations over a multitude of points in physics. There's still a <i>lot</i> of stuff left unexplained, and currently unpredictable by the Standard Model. Dark matter and dark energy are just a couple of them. How the universe even started is still another. The <i>big</i> questions are still unanswered and may well surprise us all.<p>Also remember that there is the Standard Model Higgs boson, the one predicted by theory, and what's just being seen in experimental data. The team doing the announcement the other day were very explicit in saying that they've found a Higgs-like particle, but it may not be exactly the one in the Standard Model. i.e. There may be multiple types of Higgs bosons. Its going to take years of more research to really nail down what's just now being glimpsed.<p>Another good thing to keep in mind is the place of Newtonian physics in the Standard Model. Up until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Newtonian physics were very well understood, and some scientists thought that may well have been all there was to know. Newtonian physics fits nicely inside the Standard Model. Its entirely possible, though who's to say if probable or not, that the current Standard Model will itself fit into an entirely new overarching branch of physics in the decades to come.<p>The LHC will be operating for 3 more months so that even more data can be collected, then will be shut down for about 2 years for repairs and upgrades. When it comes back on line, it will be much, much more powerful and who knows what might be discovered yet.",1341530291

Going back and looking at your process and finding ways you can make it better, faster, cheaper, more reliable, etc.<p>Kanban IS the new Scrum insomuch as it's the latest buzzword, but any agile process should be in itself ""agile"". As in, it's about shipping using the best possible process for your situation. Maybe that's scrum, or kanban, or waterfall, or something in between.<p>If you are using any of them you should ask what problem you have with your current process and what you are solving by doing scrum, xp, kanban, etc. Dit it work? Can it be done better? What needs to be fixed?<p>Iterate enough on your process and you'll be running like a well oiled machine regardless of what method you use. People get good at stuff with practice.<p>Where it goes wrong I think is when you worry more about scrum vs. kanban vs. xp vs. flavor of the week because the rules don't matter, doing your work better for whatever definition of better you're optimizing for is what truly matters.",1341529441

After some thought, I realized how much time I waste just mindlessly surfing the net every day.<p>One point the article made was that scheduling is key, especially is self-discipline isn't your strong point (and believe me, it isn't a strong point of mine). So I decided that, before going to bed, I would create a schedule for the following day (that is, today) and stick to it. There were a few bumps along the road that required moving some things around but now it's 7:00 PM and I've managed to complete everything on the list up until this point.<p>From now on, I will be explicitly scheduling free time (I actually have some coming up in about 30 minutes).",1341529226

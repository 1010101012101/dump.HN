8831614,comment,8831334,8831465,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, how to do we revive Persona? I mean, it&#x27;s still around, but it&#x27;s been kind of back-burnered by Mozilla.<p>The odd thing is that I didn&#x27;t even know it existed until this whole conversation about Google dropping OpenID came up...and I use Firefox as my browser across all my devices, I use sync, I use Thunderbird, I follow the Firefox OS development with interest, and yet, I had no idea Persona was a thing.<p>I&#x27;ve always been uncomfortable with Google and Facebook being my &quot;identity&quot; provider, and I&#x27;ve been equally uncomfortable with the fact that they would happily provide those authentication services but won&#x27;t accept them (i.e. I can login to thousands of services using my Google or Facebook account, but I can&#x27;t login to Google or Facebook with any other service account). I simply don&#x27;t like Google and Facebook owning my online life, but the convenience of it often trumps the ethical and privacy implications. I have, thus far, avoided integrating Google or Facebook logins on my sites because of the ethical implications, but I hate making my users keep up with passwords and usernames.<p>Why aren&#x27;t more websites supporting Persona?<p>For my part, I plan to integrate Persona into the next version of my company website launching early this year, as well as our wiki and blogs. I may even try to figure out how to fit it into our products, somehow.<p>I found the following, seemingly maintained, extensions for Persona support in the apps I use for the websites I maintain:<p><a href=""https://www.drupal.org/project/persona"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.drupal.org/project/persona</a><p><a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/browserid/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wordpress.org/plugins/browserid/</a><p><a href=""https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Persona"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Persona</a>",1420311555

My mental model of improving my rationality was something like acquiring lots and lots of impressive and clever tools and then training myself to apply them in context appropriate places. I&#x27;ve come around to a model much more in line with this checklist though. Something like:<p>1. Noticing behavioral patterns<p>2. Thinking hard and doing research on the pattern, whether it leads to good or bad outcomes and whether modifying it is cost effective<p>3. Using habit formation techniques to modify things<p>4. Reviewing and reflecting on what is and isn&#x27;t working for things I have modified using the above steps<p>Old me would have considered this very laborious. You only get to make small changes this way and you aren&#x27;t guaranteed they work.

8831584,comment,8830609,8831156,0,0,warfangle,,,"That&#x27;s the 2010 census; if you look at the 2013 American Community Survey&#x27;s 1-year estimate, someone making $100,000 is suddenly only making more than 87.7% of earners - and is $40,000 more than median for someone with a graduate or professional degree [0].<p>If you look at households, that percentage is much lower - at $150,000 they&#x27;re in the 90.1%; at $100,000 a household (aka an individual earner living alone or as the sole earner in a household) is in the 77.4% [1].<p>> If that&#x27;s the middle class, then what does that make the other 93%, who are worse off?<p>You&#x27;ve introduced a false dichotomy here. Just because an individual in the 93% (by your own figures) or a household in the 77.4% (by the ACS figures) is considered middle class doesn&#x27;t mean that someone in the 57.5% (~$50,000) isn&#x27;t also middle class. These things aren&#x27;t linearly distributed.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s pretty evident that neither one is upper class. But that depends on the definition of upper class, no?<p>What is your definition of upper class? Sheer income percentile, or what an individual can actually accomplish at a given income percentile?<p>General usage has upper class being those who can afford not to work if they so choose; those who not only are rich themselves, but whose families have been rich for several generations. They send their children to private schools with a higher tuition than a State university; they probably own more than one home. I don&#x27;t know any SWE that can claim that unless they were born to it or got in just after (or before) the first round of investment at a unicorn like Google or Instagram.<p>&quot;Upper middle class&quot; is a pretty apt term, and usually reserved for those in professions like software development (surprise!), mechanical engineering, architecture, managerial, etc. Those under this label are usually comfortable, can easily afford to own their own home, and - in comparison to the creature comforts available - better off than royalty from two hundred years ago.<p>But in comparison to the creature comforts of those just 1-2% above them, they&#x27;re paupers. And those in the 95% are, to those in the top 1% (generally considered the cutoff for Upper Class), simply one head of chattel among the unwashed, hepatitis ridden, gout prone proletariat.<p>0. <a href=""http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_1YR_S2001&prodType=table"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/p...</a>

> The law requires H-1B workers to be paid the higher of the prevailing wage for the same occupation and geographic location, or the same as the employer pays to similarly situated employees. Other factors, such as age and skill were not permitted to be taken into account for the prevailing wage.<p>Here are some other points of confusion:<p>1) Some people are hung on the term &quot;programmer&quot;, I think what is meant by this term is someone who is A) deeply technical, B) codes, C) contributes to product fit, and D) contributes project planning.<p>2) Some people are hung up on the term &quot;great&quot; programmer&quot;. Good programmers get their work done on time and with high quality. Great programmers contribute key insights that transform the product or team in ways that that directly lead to accomplishing the team&#x27;s goals. Personally I&#x27;ve found that it is often possible to distinguish between good and bad programmers. It has been much harder to distinguish between good and great programmers.<p>3) Some people are hung up on the fact that great programmers are frequently not paid 10 or 100 or 1000 times what good programmers are paid. There are three very good reasons for this. A) A great programmer has to be in the right position to be commensurately rewarded. (The world&#x27;s greatest fly fisherman will receive a normal wage on a commercial fishing boat.) B) A great programmer is making decisions and taking actions that will result in raised profits. They don&#x27;t get paid up front because the money isn&#x27;t there yet. C) Many people have never worked with a great programmer. The programmers that they think are great are only 1.5X or 2X or 3X. That isn&#x27;t.<p>4) Some people are hung up on the fact that PG seems to make either A) the assumption that H-1B recipients are great programmers, or B) the assumption that if the US grants more H-1Bs annually that there all the additional recipients will be great programmers. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s making either of those assumptions. There is a curve of capability and potential for H-1B recipients just like every other population. PG is saying that any increase in the number of great programmers in the US is good for the US.<p>5) The final question is what does it mean for something to be good for the US?
A) If an H-1B recipient starts the next facebook is it good for the US? It will be great for angels, VCs and institutional investors. It will be good for the US because the US will tax everyone&#x27;s personal compensation (although any eventually corporate profits will likely be tax sheltered). It will be good for the US because jobs will be created (although there might be fewer jobs at the companies being disrupted.
B) If the H-1B recipient only winds up doing good job at a corporation then the corporation did not need offer a more attractive salary to a US citizen or train a US citizen to do the job. This is good for the corporation because their costs are lower (assuming the cost of the H-1B application process is lower than the cost of offering a more attractive salary or training an individual with potential). This is bad for the individual who might otherwise have been trained or received increased compensation. However if the role is truly a role that would not otherwise have been filled then there is no individual who is negatively impacted by hiring an H-1B applicant.<p>Here is something to think about:
1) The company is willing to compensate a programmer $COST for a role.   
2) The company expects an increase in revenue of $REVENUE as result of the additional headcount.
3) The company has a return on investment goal of ROI for the year. It might be an internal figure or something promised to its investors.
4) The company can only hire a candidate if (REVENUE-COST)/COST > ROI
5) There are two reasons for hiring H-1Bs A) because the company can not find anyone else who will accept a compensation that makes the equation work or B) because the company can not hire anyone for the role (perhaps they or their industry has a negative reputation or no reputation).<p>There are certainly things that complicate this equations:
1) Perhaps the company is forward looking enough to hire in advance of expected attrition.
2) Perhaps the individual is in a role that supports revenue creation by another individual. 
3) Perhaps the company has an &quot;up or out&quot; approach and they are hungry to find stars.
4) Perhaps the revenue that the new hire would bring in is very hard to predict. In this case the up front compensation would be reduced to account for the risk. Typically the role would come with the potential for increase compensation in the form of a bonus, stock options or commission.",1420309654

If you see objects as data structures with methods rather than isolated processes with message based interfaces (think actor model), it&#x27;s not all that surprising anthropomorphisms don&#x27;t add much value.  However, when your conceptual model of objects implies each object is a concurrent and isolated process, anthropomorphisms make sense.  I sometimes even give them names and imagine them as employees in an organization.  Asynchronous communications can be conceptualized as inboxes and outboxes of messages and synchronous communications can be thought of one employee getting into a queue himself to personally deliver the message.<p>Sometimes metaphors translate surprisingly when you become a stickler for making sure all aspects of a metaphor are accounted.",1420309366

It also encourages people to invest thought into solutions and proposals, as opposed to micromanaging how every hour of a project will get spent.<p>I think its also more fair to clients, too.  Inevitably new things take longer the first couple times you do them, and traditionally the full cost of that learning period gets passed on to the client in one way or another.  However, something that took two days to put together and figure out the first time may only take two hours to implement the next time - but it&#x27;s hardly fair that Client B is only billed 2 hours and Client A is billed 16, simply because they were first to market with something.",1420309356

In most large projects(100k-million+ loc) the largest issue is complexity.  Object oriented programming is just systematic way to organize that complexity.<p>The OP says that &quot;In production code, I would split it in several files as appropriate. Or not. It doesn&#x27;t really matter. What does matter is that we can easily find those procedures whenever we want to inspect or modify them.&quot;<p>It 100% does matter, and having all procedures that operate on and change the state of an object in the same file is super helpful.  Being able to make guarantees that certain state cannot be changes outside of the organization unit of the class(encapsulation) is super helpful.  Being able to abstract over certain related but non identical functions without having to resort to switch statements is super helpful.(polymorphism)  And the ability to reuse code when different pieces of data share some identical features and we want to abstract over a portion of those features is useful(inheritance).<p>OOP doesn&#x27;t give you any abilities you didn&#x27;t have before, and you can write great readable structured procedural code.  But it does give you more tools in your tool box that when used correctly can help structure your code in a way that limits the burden of the software&#x27;s complexity.",1420309316

And OK, as I read in previous discussion, Google will also in the future support logins from people with normal eMail account.<p>Still, I am worried, since Google does not clearly communicate these facts, but when you look at their communications, you read only about &quot;Google+ Signin&quot; and you have to search to find that you do not need Google+ but just the new protocol OpenID connect.<p>I don&#x27;t like to see such communications from a company, that once claimed (long, long time ago!! Do you remember Google?) &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot;.<p>It is OK, when they move away from an old protocol, but it is not OK, when they (and it very much looks that way to me!) use it as vehicle to market their products. Google has troubled people enough with forcing G+ on them -- so I even find it more troublesome, how they do it now (as it seems to me currently).<p>I fear, Google is still hunting after Facebook and is by the way inheriting its bad habits.<p>As I see now, they also want that a new button is used -- something with G+ on it. I see, they really lay the pressure on the people -- many people will think, that they need a Google+ account to use this feature (even if not required). I would say, Google you are going to hurt yourself!<p>I myself, was thinking about using a &quot;Login with Google&quot; button in my application ... but now, with things changed, I will think twice, before I do such a move!",1420309215
8831490,comment,8830810,8831359,0,0,winter_blue,,,"That was an excellent essay. You made some great observations here:<p><i>Many of those railing against the idea of letting in more programmers (or workers in general) have a simplified view of the economy, in which there are a fixed number of jobs to go around.  10,272, say.  And if you let in more people, there will be more competition for those jobs, and therefore lower wages.  The people arguing against immigration are afraid that they won’t make as much money.<p>This is known as the lump of labor fallacy.  It is zero-sum thinking in which for one to gain, another must lose.  It is wrong, with the simplest example being that there are clearly more jobs and more money in the US economy now than 100 years ago.  Currently, there are approximately 320 million people in the United States.  100 years ago, there were roughly 100 million.  Clearly, something happened for the country to have gained both people, jobs, and money: the economy grew.<p>...<p>People living in a country founded by immigrants trying to keep out other people hoping for a better life for themselves and their families is questionable, at best, and very ugly at its worst.  In reading the reactions to Graham’s essay, I would not ascribe blatant, outright racism to most people commenting, but there’s certainly an ugly undercurrent of “us” and “them”. ... At one time, it was considered acceptable to keep black people out of ‘good jobs’.  Attempting to keep foreigners out of jobs seems broadly similar to me: it’s immoral and based on bad economics.</i>",1420309199

8831487,comment,8814202,8817281,0,0,waps,,,"First except of course for the corner cases that Go thinks should not be accounted for. These include serious system failures (e.g. gc fails for some reason), memory allocation failures, and of course anything that calls panic. Other errors are effectively impossible to be handled (e.g. system is thrashing and Go&#x27;s gc runs - you&#x27;ll never see your program again). So this can&#x27;t be solved.<p>So please don&#x27;t say Go doesn&#x27;t have exception handling. It has code that detects exceptional conditions and attempts to handle them by unrolling the stack. Of course that&#x27;s entirely different from &quot;exceptions&quot;, right ?<p>Plus it once again points out the schizophrenic nature of Go. Go uses error codes. Except when it doesn&#x27;t. Go doesn&#x27;t have generics. Except when it does. Go doesn&#x27;t allow polymorphism. Except in ~5 cases. No language on the planet allows for return type polymorphism (meaning of the function changes depending on what you assign it&#x27;s result to) ... except of course Go.<p>This was one of the main, and valid, objections people had to languages like modula-2, oberon and the like in the past. And maybe I&#x27;m getting old, but my money&#x27;s on that the pendulum will swing back again.<p>Furthermore I disagree with your assessment. Go and C insist on the same thing : in-line errors. In C that lead to errors being ignored in the vast majority of cases by &quot;average&quot; programmers. In Go ... well, here&#x27;s the top-5 of Go projects. Go and take a look for yourself :<p><a href=""https://github.com/trending?l=go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/trending?l=go</a> (note: changes every day. Now check if errors are ignored today or not. Today&#x27;s answer 4 of the top 5 projects ignore almost all errors)<p>But I don&#x27;t see how your comment addresses the complete unnatural way of thinking that C and Go promote. Handing errors in-line is not natural. This was one of the big complaints when we moved from C to Java/Python, a move supported by a lot of programmers.<p>So let&#x27;s be honest here. Go&#x27;s philosophy in practice is to make users ignore errors.",1420309156

Then I started thinking about it; on the high level his arguments are weak. E.g. the overall theme of his rant seems to boil down to &quot;If Esperanto has flaws, it can&#x27;t be good&quot;, and on the low level, his arguments are weak, he gets right down to &quot;A flaw in Esperanto is that the 1905 published book on it contained a typo&quot;. That&#x27;s someone with a real axe to grind.<p>I&#x27;m not linguist enough to follow very closely, but pages and pages of this are essentially. &quot;Here&#x27;s what Esperanto did. It&#x27;s bad because it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d have done&quot;. Look:<p><i>The actual forms of these inflections (‐os?  ‐inta?) are unconvincing.  Worst of all is ‐u, the imperative.  Most languages, for obvious reasons, arrange it so that commands can be given via the most basic verbal “stem” available, not a special, uniquely inflected form!</i><p>Well I disagree, I like that basic stems and imperatives are clearly different.

You can&#x27;t even give him the benefit of the doubt? He spent ten years working on this and the only way he did something you like was blind luck?<p>On and on, sour grapes and &quot;hypothetically it could be done differently and more to my taste&quot; by the author.<p>Yes there are some valid criticisms in there, the way &quot;Three twelfths, 32nds and Thirty halves&quot; are written the same, numerically.<p>But then we come back to... what&#x27;s the point of the article? &quot;If there are problems it must be completely useless?&quot; or &quot;If I can find no problems then everyone would speak it?&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s possible to design a language that nobody would find any flaws with?&quot;.<p>Anyway, let me not whinge forever, since I&#x27;m not a fluent Esperantist or a linguist.

An unlimited marketing budget may be necessary but it is not sufficient, even with a notionally attractive proposition like the surface. It cannot overcome fundamental product issues like being too expensive, lacking killer applications, poor product targeting (who is the Surface RT <i>really</i> for?), or even just entrenched negative consumer perception. I think the Surface RT had all these issues and the marketing was not all that great on top of it.",1375232320

6131174,story,,,7,4,randomdesi,"Do people know about fraud by third party IT consultancy companies?",,"This is just an effort to inform the folks on HN (Future CEOs of big companies :) ) about the routine fraud by many IT consultancy companies with fake resumes and fake phone interviews etc. 
Since I am from India, I know of many small scale IT companies run by Indians in US which cheat both the clients and the candidates, with these tactics, but I suspect the thing is not necessarily limited to Indian companies.
Here is a typical situation:
1. The company recruits students / graduates without any experience promising them training and job placement. They don&#x27;t need any CS or IT experience whatsoever, but they are promised they can get 60K+ jobs in whatever technology is.
2. The consultancy creates fake resumes for the candidates and starts forwarding them to other consultancies and clients etc. The guys routinely put 5 or 6 years of fake work experience without knowing a thing about the area.
3. Many companies don&#x27;t pay anything to the candidates while they are being &quot;trained&quot;, though they are paid on paper because of the immigration requirements.
 4. When it&#x27;s the time for the phone interview, the guy you are interviewing may not be real candidate. Or he may have a couple of other people also listening in and helping him with written answers.
5. Since it&#x27;s just a contractor job many big companies don&#x27;t even bother doing an in-person interview trusting the consulting companies.
 6. It&#x27;s possible that some of the managers in the big companies have indirect associations with these consultancies forcing them to stick to some consultancies despite getting really bad people from them some times.
 7. Finally the guy who knows very little about the field will join the big company as a contractor, and the consultancy takes big cut out of his pay check.
8. The employee may get fired easily first few times, but he will gain legitimate US work experience in the meanwhile and the the previous experience becomes irrelevant.",1375232198

The restricted workspace actually forces you to abstract things more, and the lack of syntax allows you to reduce repetition more than would be practical in a textual language.<p>For example, in textual languages, reducing repetition often requires you to introduce intermediate variables, which could actually make the program&#x27;s text longer, so people will avoid doing it.

It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t think anything should ever be reducible to code form, but why is that visual mapping of a complete program isn&#x27;t a standard everyday tool? I mean, it&#x27;s all very well that we have syntax highlighters showing keywords, variables and so on, but why is it that when I open a program there isn&#x27;t a tool to automatically show me loops, arrays and so on?<p>Loops are one of the simplest programming structures; 90% of loops look like:<p><pre><code>  LOOP foo FROM bar to baz:
    something
    something
    something
    profit
    foo = foo + 1
  END LOOP

If you do that, it doesn&#x27;t really matter where you&#x27;re hosting.

* OCZ drives have very poor reliability, probably due to insufficient memory validation.<p>* Kingston drives seem to have reliability issues, perhaps also due to insufficient memory validation?<p>* ADATA drives also seem to have issues due to memory validation.<p>* Crucial drives are plagued by firmware issues.

* Samsung 840 EVO (potential to be the best SSD)<p>* SanDisk Extreme II (brand new, lots of potential)<p>* SanDisk Ultra Plus (would make a decent low-end drive, but isn&#x27;t usually much cheaper than the other faster drives in the &quot;Good&quot; list above such as the Mushkin Enhanced Chronos)<p>* Seagate 600 and 600 Pro (new LAMD-based drives, seem to have potential)<p>* Crucial M500 (960GB model is interesting, but M500 has firmware issues, Crucial has a BAD history resolving those)<p>* Corsair Neutron (new LAMD-based drive with the same name and better performance, how to tell apart from old slower Corsair Neutron?)",1375229891

But it needs to be said. Everything in that video is of stuff that has been researched for decades. It isn&#x27;t mainstream largely because it is facile to say &#x27;declarative programming&#x27; or what have you, but something entirely different for it to be easier and better. Prolog is still around. Go download a free compiler, and try to write a 3D graphical loop that give you 60 fps. Try to write some seismic code with it. Try to write web browser. Not so easy. Much was promised by things like Prolog, declarative programming, logic programming, expert systems, and so on, but again it is easy to promise, hard to deliver. We didn&#x27;t give up, or forget the ideas, it is just that the payoff wasn&#x27;t there (except in niche areas where in fact all of these things are going strong, as you would expect).<p>Graphical programming doesn&#x27;t work because programs are not 2 dimensional, they are N dimensional, and you spend all your time trying to fit things on a screen in a way that doesn&#x27;t look like a tangled ball of yarn (hint, can&#x27;t be done). I&#x27;ve gone through several CASE tools through my decades, and they all stink. Not to mention, I don&#x27;t really think visually, but more &#x27;structurally&#x27; - in terms of the interrelations of things.

First of all, you cannot write any nontrivial program in UML alone. It is not nearly specific enough. UML is to a working program as a table of contents is to a technical manual. And in case you think I&#x27;m extrapolating from one bad experience, I&#x27;ve also used LabView have seen the parallel difficulties in that language.<p>Now, I agree that higher levels of abstraction will be needed in the future, but I disagree that visual programming is an obviously superior abstraction. In fact, I believe that people have been earnestly barking up that tree for decades with little success for reasons unrelated to old-fashioned attitudes. There are practical and technical reasons why developing visual programming tools and ecosystems will always be more difficult than developing text-based ones.<p>Take merging for example. Merging two versions of a source file is many times over a solved problem (not that there aren&#x27;t new developments to be made). In contrast, merging two versions of a UML diagram is very much a manual process (to the extent that it&#x27;s possible at all). Now consider creating a change management tool allows you to branch and merge UML diagrams. This is orders of magnitude harder yet. These are essential and straightforward use cases that are much more complex in a visual medium. Without these basic features, visual programming will not scale well to even medium-size teams.<p>I can go into more detail about issues with visual programming if I still haven&#x27;t made my case.

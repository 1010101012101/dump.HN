I.e more about the phrase ""less than f nodes fail at any give point in time"".<p>Is that tunable and how dynamic is that. (Set once or dynamic setting? Also set per running cluster, per name space, per key-value pair?)<p>Also, how is this f number related to the total number of machines in the cluster and how is it related to the number of data replicas?",1340636358

In my experience they do pretty well understanding the whole ""lifecycle"" of the information and help optimize information flow between various parts of a business. They shine well when there are multiple places data lives, and when there are many uses for shared information. Then they are good at figuring out where data lives, what is important for just an app or subset of apps, and when that information is a global requirement. They aren't DBAs, but they seem like it sometimes. They can figure out where there is bad duplication, where duplication makes everyone's life easeir, an when to use what representation for something. Basically a good IA can help ensure that your data flows well.<p>Programmers have a tendency to optimize the data architecture towards their specific project, while IAs optimize it between various business units.

The strength of a system lies in how well its primitives handle unanticipated uses. Undoubtedly, a system with  a ""do_benchmark()"" interface would achieve the best results, but this is not a good way to build systems. For the record, HyperDex's interface is at the same level of abstraction as Redis's in this case.<p>* The benchmark compares ""single-core Redis"" to ""multi-core HyperDex."" It is true that HyperDex was designed from the ground up for a networked, multi-core system. Redis is not sharded and seems to work best when co-located on the same host as its clients. If your data fits on one host and clients are on the same machine, you should probably use Redis and not HyperDex. As for the complaint, we would have used something other than ""single-core Redis"" if such a thing existed. Our emails to Salvatore asking for an alternative binary went unanswered -- he chose to respond with blog entries instead of code.<p>* The benchmark is not real: The benchmark in question is the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark. It's not something we made up. One can only imagine the kind of criticism we would get if we had actually constructed our own benchmarks. YCSB is an industry-standard benchmark commonly used to evaluate the performance of key-value stores.<p>These kinds of issues are really easy to resolve, without having to recourse to noise on blogs and HN: We urge everyone to test their own apps against the git repo. We worked hard to make HyperDex the best key-value store out there with the strongest properties, and we hope you find it useful.",1340633973

So in principal by encoding each stream with one of these states, a bunch can be transmitted at the same time in the same beam.<p>I might venture a guess that this was done over a short distance in a closed room.

4156566,comment,4156367,4156367,22,0,kamaal,,,"I started using Perl around 2006'ish, that was pretty late in the day compared to most Perl hackers. I was primarily a C/C++ Dev, going the OO way. And I was doing Java here and there.<p>Until one morning a colleague of mine, saw me doing some stuff I was taking really long to finish. He just walked up to my cubicle and just said 'Why dont you use Perl to do this' and then started my crazy journey with Perl. What I really like about languages like Perl/Python and Ruby is how quickly you can go from learning to building something really useful.<p>Perl has seen atleast 3 major rise in its popularity since its inception. First one among sysadmins, its from these days that you will powerful terse, small but elegant solutions to a range of problems. If you ever get a chance, do browse and read essays from Tom christiansen written during those times. They are just pure gem. The second was during Perl/CGI days. And third was the most recent with the Modern Perl movement. Much of the thanks for this goes to People like Chromatic, Audrey, People of p5p, Moose devs and etc. From each of those times, you will see varying variety of code written. Starting from really amazing one liners to at times some frustrating code during the dot com bubble, to now where Perl code really looks very nice.<p>Modern Perl really is set of many successful sub projects. And its not just code, it covers everything. Code is just the beginning. To give you an example, these days you have very nice cpan package managers. You can search packages using Metacpan in a very user friendly GUI with nice syntax highlighting. You have awesome documentation, Modern Perl book really is the Perl's equivalent of the K&R book. There is Moose, And there are things like Class::MOP. There are things like DBIx::Class.<p>In terms of other new breath taking stuff you will see things like Devel::Declare. This allows new syntax extensions to be written using Perl itself. Then as a result you have a range of modules like Moosex::<extensions>,Try::Catch, Gather::Take etc.<p>In terms of web frameworks your have Catalyst.<p>So its really these many many successful subprojects together which form 'Modern Perl', if you wish to describe it that way. Its no one thing. Code, documentation, culture, events, infrastructure etc etc all together form the 'Modern Perl' thing.<p>If you come to the Perl core development, then they have real good time based releases. They are fixing bugs, adding new features, and doing a lot of amazing stuff. There have been pretty neat syntax features added in the past few releases and I guess much of Perl 6 based features will continually seep into Perl 5 as needed over time.<p>Modern Perl, or other wise. Perl continues to retain its niche. Which is text heavy lifting, automation, rapid prototyping, development, a deep learing curve and larger gains in productivity with time. Its still the go-to tool for most back end tasks. If you wish to get something done faster, with little effort, sanely with little bugs in say over a weekend, You have little alternatives apart from Perl. If you are in dev ops and you have P1 tickets standing on your head pretty often, a tool like Perl is indispensible.<p>And most importantly its areas of strengths are only growing- Unicode, regular expressions, CPAN, powerful syntax etc. If you ever get a chance Higher Order Perl is one book you must read. It really opens your mind to elegant solution to a range of problems.<p>But like every other language, you need to invest time and effort incrementally to keep yourself updated.",1340633613

The SAM/OAM properties that are being exploited here are physical phenomenon that conform to quantum mechanics just like everything else.  We're talking about photons here that have physical/dimensional properties -- therefore, there WILL be an upper bound.  I agree with user:recursive that ""infinite"" is a bad choice of wording.",1340633044

If you want to get really into it, you can. I haven't spent any additional money on it since I bought it in 2007, and it's still a riot.<p>Sure, there's some cultural stuff that you'll have to get used to (and will become apparent) as you play more, but it's not nearly as much of a commitment as, say, WoW. A newbie (to the game, not to FPSes) can pick it up and play immediately at a fairly decent level. At the same time, there's a rich culture and stories and little things you can discover, if you care enough to spend the time finding them. If not, you can just blow some stuff up and go about your day.",1340633032

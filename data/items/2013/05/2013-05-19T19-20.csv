So the basic concept of self-sufficiency gives you the meaning of bootstrapping a compiler, or your OS's bootstrap loader, or a bootstrapped startup. Stuff like Twitter Bootstrap does stretch the meaning somewhat (I guess the idea is that's it's an easy way to get started on your website).",1368993519

  MapReduce, the algorithm that makes Google so massively scalable.

Because your functions don't change the state of data, you can confidently combine them into new functions, producing a sort of chain effect. This can lead to very concise programs since there is no need to hold intermediate variables (i, count, temp, ...) in some place. What you sometimes end up with are one liners that -- if the functions are named well enough -- explain the entire logic of the program.<p>There are certain problems that lend themselves well to the functional style, mainly those where you are piping a piece of data through various functions and applying different transformations to it.

But that does not mean I let my kids listen to cursing or watch nudity willy nilly. To me it is not that the hearing of cursing itself is bad. The problem is that kids start saying those words themselves in inappropriate settings. That reflects badly upon you as a parent. Things related to nudity, sex, bodily functions etc is not easy either. Like when visiting a restaurant toilet and your son asks questions about how you pie very loud so everybody else can hear. It is not really about the kids, but the fact that everybody care a lot about what everybody else thinks about you and your kids.<p>E.g. in Norway where I am from, it is perfectly normal to let kids run around stark naked at the beach. It is seen as natural and nobody stares or makes a fuss about it. I don't have a problem with that. However when visiting the US, we don't let the kids run around naked at the beach. Not because we suddenly changed our attitudes towards nudity, but because we don't want to stick out. We don't want people to stare at us and think we are bad parents.<p>Ironically I read something related when visiting the DDR museum in Berlin. Being nude at the beach started as a protest against the conformist communist party.

Something fresh, personal, less bureaucratic, more user-centered, easy to use, simple but yet powerful and flexible. Tracking time doesnt have to be a headache and itself take too much time.<p>Initially it was our internal project but then we though ""if it works perfectly for us, maybe we should let other people use it? Maybe they will also find it useful as we did?"" It currently solves our team needs for 100%<p>Private Alpha (coming in a week or two) was created because we feel like its time to start letting people in, but we wanted to make sure that each person who joins knows why we built our own tool, what we are doing differently and what its all about. Only in such a way we can more closely examine every feedback and be able to treat everyone personally.<p>Some of our ideas are still being developed, but its important that we keep the needs of other people in mind as we continue perfecting our platform.<p>Thanks in advance.<p>P.S. For all who support us at the beginning we will return a favor.",1368992202

Social research has shown this beyond that case - when an angry mob gathers, they often still repress their hostility, but when a window breaks, that is when things go into a free-for-all.<p>I think it's the same here.  People can have opinions, but once says Microsoft is great and open source sucks or something like that, you're already past the point of no return, it's inevitable the thread or sub-thread will devolve into a flame war.<p>Certain threads are this way starting from the original topic.  Like the threads, amidst the recent threads of falling programmer salaries (or perhaps mentions of the historically high unemployment rates) of the desire of the SV barons to raise the H1B cap.  This again is guaranteed to degenerate into a flame war.<p>My unscientific study of HN is that someone can get a lot of karma for saying why they think Obama is good or bad or the like.  A post on that guarantees a dozen upvotes.  Someone making a cogent comment on how a company should limit the scope of what parts of C++ they use is not going to get as much karma.<p>I have been on BBSs since the 1980s.  The real problem of a forum is this.  It has a handful of very sharp, interesting people who like communicating with each other and who write good posts.  Then you get some blabbermouths who post and post and post and fill the boards up with junk.  Then the good people leave.  The good people leaving is the problem.<p>I don't think flames are the only thing to be concerned with.  Blabbermouths who have nothing to say kill boards as well.  Have flamewars killed the Linux kernel mailing list?  Just as long as things are kept under control.  The NetBSD/OpenBSD flamewar got out of control.<p>Slashdot is a board that was good and had its founders leave and is all corporate and user-view baiting now.  What are its topics right now?  ""Google's Nexus Q Successor Hits the FCC"".  Who cares?  ""John McAfee's Belize Home Burns To Ground"".  I can survive a few weeks without an update on McAfee.  ""NetBSD 6.1 Has Shipped"".

It's good to have some realistic numbers about what Developer Auction is offering for talent. What really boggles me is that Developer Auction has an entirely separate hiring track for growing their own team. They don't trust their own vetting process, and instead put candidates through an entirely different screening process. I don't understand this yet.<p>Their offering to talented developers seems to be somewhat limited. Basically you sign up, spend a while writing out a huge profile (in addition to your resume and public work on github), then they just dump you into the laps of recruiters as part of their normal hiring pipeline. Hey, if I wanted to sit around doing 15 hours of live algorithm screening, I would have just called those companies myself...<p>This is probably okay for junior developers, but realistically junior developers just need to have a pulse to get hired (and maybe one or two sample projects). As for senior talent, there's few incentives to participate in these antics. Same antics, different names. I got a bunch of offers, but they require a great deal of effort to follow up on everyone and schedule a billion interviews and screens and other things that I am frankly exhausted by.<p>I would love something like a 1-hour guarantee: receive an initial offer to see if the range is what you have in mind, spend exactly one hour talking with a company before receiving an actual truly real sign-on-the-dotted-line offer.

</code></pre>
The for loop is a good idea, though I prefer the ""while read"" idiom since it fits in with the pipeline better:<p><pre><code>    ...
    | awk '{print $1}'                      \
    | while read line; do which $line; done \
    ...
</code></pre>
That finally works for me. Here's the whole thing:<p><pre><code>    history                                     \
        | sed ""s/^[0-9 ]*//""                    \
        | perl -pe 's/ *\| */\n/g'              \
        | awk '{print $1}'                      \
        | while read line; do which $line; done \
        | sed ""s.^/usr..""                       \
        | grep ^.bin                            \
        | sed ""s/^.*\///""                       \
        | sort                                  \
        | uniq -c                               \
        | sort -rn</code></pre>",1368990748

Help him understand how the malware was installed and how he can try and prevent it from happening in the future (don't allow applications to be installed if they weren't specifically expecting it, keep their AV running - no matter what an installer says, always install Java and Adobe updates, and avoiding dodgy streaming video and proxy sites).<p>I recently had to help a friend clean ransomware off his system, and found a bunch of other crap while I was at it.  --I <i>think</i> I got it all, but I still warned him that it was possible we missed something and a full format and reinstall would be safer.

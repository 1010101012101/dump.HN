Chances are the response will be something like ""I'd start every day at the gym and work out for two hours until I was as buff as Brad Pitt. Then I'd practice the piano for three hours. I'd become fluent in Mandarin so that I could be prepared to understand the largest transformation of our time. I'd really learn how to handle a polo pony. I'd learn to fly a helicopter. I'd finish the screenplay that I've been writing and direct a production of it in HDTV.""<p>Why hasn't he accomplished all of those things? ""Because I'm chained to this desk 50 hours per week at this horrible [insurance|programming|government|administrative|whatever] job.<p>So he has no doubt that he would get all these things done if he didn't have to work? ""Absolutely none. If I didn't have the job, I would be out there living the dream.""<p>Suppose that the guy cashes in his investments and does retire. What do we find? He is waking up at 9:30 am, surfing the Web, sorting out the cable TV bill, watching DVDs, talking about going to the gym, eating Doritos, and maybe accomplishing one of his stated goals.

A quick View Source reveals a dearth of helpful hooks like classes or ids, but the comic image is the only one with a URL of the form <a href=""http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/comic_name.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/comic_name.png</a>, so it might be better to check for that. Here's some new bookmarklet code based on this approach.<p><a href=""http://gist.github.com/13311"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/13311</a><p>Obviously this will break if there are ever two comics on the page, since it will just print an alert for the first one and execution will then halt.",1222509723

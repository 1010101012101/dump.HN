7686818,comment,7684752,7685529,2,0,alexatkeplar,,,"Part of the difficulty is that there are very few open source _applications_ (vs frameworks) built using MapReduce available to study. The only ones I know of are:<p><pre><code>     https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow\n     https://github.com/PredictionIO/PredictionIO\n</code></pre>\nWe (Snowplow) use MapReduce primarily to:<p>1. Scale our event enrichment process horizontally - raw events come in, we validate them, enrich them (IP -> geo etc), store them. With MapReduce, we just throw more boxes at the enrichment process for larger users (we enrich 200m events in ~90 mins on 6 x c3.2xlarges, spot cost of $0.58)<p>2. Do easy recomputations across user&#x27;s full history of raw events - e.g. we add a new enrichment or a user&#x27;s business logic changes, we can rerun over their full history going back to 2012<p>Hope this helps!",1399049940

7686814,comment,7683963,7683963,4,0,unwiredben,,,"Reminds me of a story from back in the mid-90s at my first job.  I was working in Motorola&#x27;s paging products group and helping bring up a ARM7-based microcontroller that we were testing for two-way pagers.  I was in the ASIC group that had put together the chip and had written a simple test monitor shell that ran over serial and let us test out the registers.<p>I was on location at an engineering office in Florida where we were adding features to the monitor to test out new systems.  At one point, the builds stopped working -- they never seemed to come out of reset successfully.<p>After work with the logic analyzer to try to watch the memory bus to see what instructions were running in memory, I finally hit on the answer.  The linker was placing the init code at the end of our binary, and the latest code we added had pushed the init routines past the first 64K of program code.  However, on this microcontroller, some of the address lines were multiplexed with general purpose IO lines, so out of reset, trying to get to higher addresses just wouldn&#x27;t work; you&#x27;d be loading low-memory code instead.<p>A quick rework of the linker command line to reorder code sections and some modifications to the init code to flip those lines to address mode, and everything started working again.",1399049897

As evidenced by some colleagues, without experienced leadership on a project a group of journeyman programmers can produce some incredibly creatively broken multithreaded code. The experience part can be taught, discipline can be encouraged and developed with the right leaders/mentors. But without motivated individuals on the team (to learn this particular aspect of development) or mentors/leaders pushing/pulling them along, it&#x27;s unlikely to happen until it&#x27;s too late.<p>But, some people have to fail before they learn.

I am fine in small groups of people (2-5), but when there are more than 10 people in a room I am not very social and do not find it much fun.<p>I did outside sales for 10 years, which might sound contradictory to this, but in reality you only have to talk to people for about 2 hours a day. The rest of the time is spent in prep work, travel, learning your product (mine was technical). I liked that I could make a good living in 2 hours a day.<p>You could try starting your own business. My current setup is that I have 10 people on staff, and a very good COO to lead them all. She has joked that if we double our head count, that she could count on me to be at the office 50% of what I am now. Her prediction is that if we ever got to 50 people, then I would never come to the business at all. My contribution to my business is to do a lot of reading and thinking, and planning. I read about 2 hours a day, do another 2 hours of planning out solutions to various issues at work, and spend some time working on the website/e-marketing etc.<p>I would talk to your supervisor/CEO and ask if there is a way that you can work remotely for half the time or more.

I left the original because I thought it might clarify some of the differences between the machines for people who don&#x27;t know anything about the subject.<p>I guess I felt that the memory limitation was a misleading way of discussing the machines. Turing machines and PDAs are usually discussed with infinite memory. In practice the input really determines how much memory the machine will use.<p>Furthermore, I believe that the encoding scheme you suggest will use far more space than the equivalent Turing machine or PDA it encodes. Because, for every state in the machine you have to encode every possible memory configuration for that state. That means you have an exponential explosion in the number of states. This gets to the heart of the matter for me: when memory is bounded using the finite version of a PDA will let you match a deeper nesting of parens than a FSM because it will use memory more efficiently. You have to put the states of the machine somewhere and that place is either memory or hardware which are both limited.",1399048956

Keep in mind that in breaking into the market, you have to overtake the competitors with features that aren&#x27;t available. This would likely be possible in the mobile market, but not the desktop market.<p>Opera&#x27;s market share has been both increasing and decreasing over the last few years[1] but it looks like it is taking market share from IE users and more people are switching to chrome. So I would predict Opera&#x27;s share would go down in the future.<p>The big questions for me, would then be: What am I getting from a browser that I pay for over a free one? Can I get the same features out of plugins for a more widely adopted (and hence better supported or developed for) browser?<p>Microsoft is really business and student oriented with the majority of their products. A browser only matches part of their design goals. They want people to keep paying for their OS and don&#x27;t want products to migrate to the web where they have to compete with Google (Though they already have to do this to some extent).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I would be personally interested in something like this but don&#x27;t believe that many people outside of developers (and people doing criminal things whether moral or not) would be.<p>Not sure what you mean with the last point/question.

So they are covered whether or not the reckless driver was insured, or his insurance pays out third parties for damage.<p>Of course, as one of the other posters mentioned above. &quot;Poor reckless drivers won&#x27;t be able to pay the victim, and this will hurt the victim.&quot; Well, I&#x27;m not an advocate of more-state, but if that&#x27;s what tickles your fancy, then mandate insurance. Like, I asssume, they already do for third-party damage? I don&#x27;t live in the US so I don&#x27;t know about that.<p><i>&quot;I have 1-3 mobile phones on me most times and share around 7 SIM cards between them. Also, what about cars with more than one driver?&quot;</i>\nWell you&#x27;re an exception. And if you think that&#x27;s a reasonable argument against my solution, then you obviously didn&#x27;t read it in its entirety, or you didn&#x27;t understand it. If it&#x27;s the latter, then I&#x27;m sorry I failed you. My point is that no one really wants to fix this problem, they just want to appear to fix it.

The researcher almost certainly doesn&#x27;t care, but how the other participants perceive the role of the researcher is likely to influence their idea of fairness.<p>2. Is the money a gift from one participant to another, or are they dividing up a gift from the researcher? This difference will also trigger different responses, some of which may be related to fairness and some not.<p>Of course, any experiment might tell you something interesting.

Moreover, I think you&#x27;re going a bit far by saying that these are &quot;the same practices&quot; that we fought against in the cold war. I would argue that we don&#x27;t have nearly the grievances that those living under late 20th century communism did.<p>My big two are:\n1. Food and goods shortages requiring long lines.\n2. Extreme restrictions on freedom to travel. (You must have your papers to go to the next town, state, etc.)\nOverall my biggest issue is that communism sought to convert the entire world and that it was intrusive into its citizen&#x27;s daily lives.<p>My big issues with Snowden:\n1. Most of this was strongly suspected/known. See the Wired article from 2 years before about the Utah data center.\n2. If he did this on principle why not face the consequences of his actions. This has been a principle of resistance for years.\n3. The documentation he leaked went beyond the scope of potential constitutional violations into tradecraft and technique. He turned over a treasure trove of information to foreign spy services.",1399046419

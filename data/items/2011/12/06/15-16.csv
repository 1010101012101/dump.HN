3319614,comment,3318977,3319467,2,0,lucasjung,,,"I have a master's in aeronautical engineering, and one of my major areas of study was stability and control, which is what your Segway and F-15 examples fall under.<p>Automated flight control systems definitely do not exercise ""judgement:"" they have inputs, a transfer function (typically MIMO, these days), and outputs.  It used to be that the transfer function was fixed, but more sophisticated systems (e.g. fighter jets) often have many different transfer functions and switch between them based upon various inputs.  They don't ""decide"" or ""discover"" anything: for any given set of inputs, they will predictably produce a pre-determined set of outputs.<p>Aircraft stability and control systems are not programmed to care about, or even know about, the existance of the wings.  The closest they get to this is that they will know the current states of the control surfaces on the wings.  So it doesn't really make sense to say that the F-15 CAS was ""not programmed for"" the state of missing a wing (although it almost certainly <i>was</i> programmed to respond properly in the situation where it gets no feedback from some of the flight controls).  As you say, it's designed to reach a specific goal (keep the plane level) and then maintain that state.  If the system detects an uncommanded roll-rate, it will move the flight controls to stop that roll-rate.  It doesn't know or care that the uncommanded roll-rate is the result of asymmetric lift due to an (almost completely) missing wing: it's just going to keep moving the flight control surfaces until that roll rate goes away.  If the aicraft had been damaged in a slightly different way, it's possible that the CAS would have issued commands to the flight controls that would have departed the plane, but fortunately the handling characteristics of the aircraft remained close enough to normal that the control laws still produced good results.<p>Unfortunately, this behavior can result in mishaps when a flight control system gets erroneous inputs: when it believes that it is rolling when it is wings-level (or believies it is level when it is rolling).  This was a major contributor to the Air France fligh 447 crash.  In such situations, it takes judgement to realize that something is wrong and to figure out what to do about it.",1323185899

It wouldn't be charitable on the part of Regretsy nor would it be donation to a worthy cause, but a partial ""donation"" to Regretsy, a for-profit company. It would be ordinary profit making on the part of Regretsy in the guise of charity work!<p>I think Regretsy should just clarify with PayPal what it is they are actually doing. If Regretsy are honestly doing this for needy kids and not for their own profit, then I cannot see how it would be a win for PayPal to not accommodate this in some way.",1323185787

3319535,comment,3318977,3319436,14,0,lucasjung,,,"><i>In just a couple of years the DARPA challenge yielded cars that can drive themselves in complex urban environments.<p>I imagine with sufficient smart people working on it, flying airplanes in relatively uncluttered sky would yield results faster.</i><p>As I mentioned, many of the tasks of flying airplanes have been successfully automated.  However, there are significant complexities that pilots must deal with that don't apply to cars, and most of those still require human intervention, especially in-flight emergencies.  If your car engine quits, you pull over to the shoulder, turn on your hazard lights, and call AAA.  If your aircraft engine quits, the response is much more complex.  If the power steering on your car quits, you do pretty much the same thing as described above.  If your flight controls malfunction in an airplane, the response is much more complex.  If your car catches on fire, you do the same as above, plus get out.  If your airplane catches on fire, you've got a much bigger problem.  I could go on, but I think that gets the idea across.<p>Also, the sky is not ""relatively uncluttered.""  There are a <i>lot</i> of airplanes flying at any given moment, and most of them are concentrated onto airways.  It gets even worse in the terminal area: lots and lots of planes coming and going to and from many different directions, all in a very small piece of sky.<p>><i>As for see-and-avoid, perhaps it works for obstacles on the ground, but other aircraft are moving so fast, is it really feasile to eyeball them before they are on you? Perhaps in pursuit, but at any significant angle they flash past at hundreds of miles an hour. Only radar etc has a chance of identifying/avoiding at those speeds.</i><p>I am alive today because, on countless occasions, I and my fellow aviators have looked outside, seen another aircraft, and maneuvered to avoid a potential collision.  I think that you really don't have an accurate mental image of how this works, so I'll try to explain a little bit:<p>Consider two airliners cruising at 424 kts each, one heading due West, the other due North.  The rate of closure is 600 kts.  Depending on the atmospheric conditions, they will be visible to each other at about 10 nautical miles, which gives them an entire minute to spot each other and maneuver to avoid a collision.  Even if it's two sueprsonic fighters flying right at each other at 600 kts each, they still have thirty seconds to spot each other.  A much more realistic scenario would involve two aircraft in the terminal area, where they would be moving much more slowly, giving them much more time to see each other and respond.<p>I think the most dangerous situations are where two aircraft are on headings that are different by less than forty-five degrees: they are basically next to each other, closing from each other's sides where they are less likely to be spotted.  The rate of closure is probably very low, but that's more than made up for by the awkward situation in regards to field of view from many cockpits.",1323184502

A bakery that keeps track of its Yelp reputation and works hard to maintain a 5-star rating will attract customers from all over the city. It might even start attracting out-of-towners who are in for a visit. This bakery's ""market"" is effectively unlimited because in any major city, there are going to be out-of-towners flowing in and out on a regular basis, and some of them will be looking for a bakery.<p>A bakery that doesn't do as well at maintaining a good reputation on Yelp will have its market limited to reach of its advertising and the word-of-mouth of its customers. Now, in a relatively tech-heavy town like San Francisco, that might be fine. If you provide good croissants, you'll get mentions on blogs and Twitter, which would magnify the word of mouth effect in a manner similar to Yelp.

10264156,comment,10263129,10264004,0,0,flohofwoe,,,"This looks to me like making C++ more &quot;rusty&quot; which is a good thing IMHO, exactly for the reason that I don&#x27;t need to bring all my existing code to a new language but instead can make it &#x27;safe&#x27; in incremental steps.<p>There are many good reasons to evolve a language instead of inventing a new one, the situation is a little bit like with OpenGL: &#x27;modern OpenGL style&#x27; has nothing in common with the original OpenGL, and many ideas have been introduced in past versions which are now considered bad or dead. Still I can take the OpenGL Gears sample (which is who-knows how old) and run it on a modern GL driver.<p>This is both a good and bad thing. The bad is that it is confusing to learn OpenGL if you haven&#x27;t been following its entire history. Googling OpenGL questions will give you 10 different answers, all correct, but only for a specific time in its history. The good thing is that this approach allows me to bring a large piece of GL code incrementally to modern standards without having to rewrite everything.<p>Of course there are the new fancy 3D APIs (just like there are fancier statically typed, compiled languages compared to C++), but in general, people are underestimating the risks of rewriting a large piece of code (this is still just as true as when it was written 15 years ago: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a>)<p>What I would like to see in C++ is to have very detailed control over language features and enforce coding guidelines in my own code base. The more fine grained this control, the better. Something like &#x27;don&#x27;t allow pointer arithmetics&#x27;, &#x27;don&#x27;t allow C arrays&#x27;, &#x27;don&#x27;t allow multiple inheritance&#x27;, etc... Going with your example: as soon as the rotten meat layer is reached, the compiler would no longer accept the code unless you specifically allow it with an exception to the &#x27;modern rule-set&#x27;.<p>A combination of such rules could result in a &#x27;safe subset&#x27; which would have the same compile-times guarantees as Rust, and if the rules are violated, the compiler will complain (I think/hope this is what the presentation is mainly about).",1443002348

10264148,comment,10263572,10263572,0,0,junto,,,"Another way to do this is to already have an <i>existing</i> mini project with a bunch of unit tests.<p>It should be functional but contains known bugs, of which, some are easy for junior developers, and some are much harder for senior devs. Whilst I don&#x27;t like checking broken unit tests into source control, leaving a broken unit test in the source code is also another good test of the candidate, to see if they can fix the code to match the assertion.<p>It would also contain methods that a senior dev should be able to look at and then appreciate that there is a optimization that could be made to improve performance.<p>Everything is in a private Github repo that the candidate can be given access to and a week to play around with, giving people time (some people have families and busy lives) to complete.<p>They should issue a pull request when they are finished and their changes should be well documented.<p>Most companies have an existing product and developers are needed to support, fix and extend those existing products. It isn&#x27;t often developers get greenfield development. They need to fix code written by <i>other</i> developers.<p>The really good developers:<p>- figure out how to clone the repo<p>- comment their changes well<p>- fix all the bugs<p>- figure out how to run the unit tests<p>- fix the unit tests that don&#x27;t work<p>- optimize the poor performing methods<p>- manage to issue a pull request<p>If the developer is junior, then they might miss a few bugs and the potential optimizations, but if they can get to the point of issuing a pull request with some bug fixes and good documentation, then they have done pretty well.<p>Most importantly, check the developer&#x27;s knowledge beforehand. For example, they might not have had Git experience before. If they can figure things out for themselves, then it shows they can solve things for themselves without someone else having to hover over them constantly.<p>Finally, if they ask questions to validate their assumptions, the developer isn&#x27;t going to be one of those devs that goes off on left-field for 3 days, only to find out they got the wrong end of the stick. People that think they understand but don&#x27;t, are dangerous and expensive to your organisation in the long run.",1443002170

Only type-safe code with stack maps can run on the goroutine stacks, because the precise garbage collector has to scan the stack and has to understand where on the stack there are pointers and where there aren&#x27;t. C code breaks this requirement.<p>For calls into C, the thread stack is used, which in Go usually has 32kB, but varies on some platforms, for example on Windows, it&#x27;s 256kB IIRC. The runtime switches the stack (which only takes a few instructions), does the ABI translation and calls the function.<p>The stack switching mechanism and ABI translation mechanism have trivial overhead, most of the overhead comes from runtime bookkeeping, e.g. the runtime must ensure there are always enough threads to run user-level Go code.",1443001605

I like the idea that retirement doesn&#x27;t have to be permanent, one can start again, make use of skills not necessarily diminished with time.<p>Among the people I&#x27;ve met over the years, most impressive have been those who discovered talents in late life not having known about it before.  In her mid-sixties, one woman on a whim took a one-afternoon watercolor painting class, finding that she had a real flair for it.  Within a few months was selling paintings, and became a well-known watercolorist in the region.<p>Perhaps we tend to associate success in technological fields with younger individuals, but the article suggests otherwise, that the elderly don&#x27;t necessarily lose their &quot;edge&quot;.  Research does suggest that as we age memory and thinking work differently.  Perhaps not as quick to respond, but still just as capable of learning given the time to do so.<p>Benefits of experience are hard to quantify, indeed, experiential learning is distinct from associative learning.  The latter is important in school for example, but the ability to predict outcomes in complex situations is a function of experience vs. &quot;book learning&quot;.<p>As we continue to learn and grow in our 60&#x27;s and beyond, it&#x27;s a good thing some of the movers and shakers appreciate what we have to offer.",1442999752

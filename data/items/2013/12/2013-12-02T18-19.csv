I dealt with RIM/BB not all that long ago on behalf of an M2M prospect and was thoroughly underwhelmed; the QNX team we dealt with was sharp and fully on-point, but I got the sense that RIM was holding them back. In the end, using BB would have increased our hardware BOM by an order of magnitude (literally, they suggested we buy smartphones and use them as the basis of the hardware), so it made zero sense versus a more traditional route.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, really. QNX is a fantastic solution supported by a brilliant team, but one that&#x27;s hobbled to a hardware vendor with zero vision and even less ability to execute.",1386010757

CSS/JS refactoring/pruning would definitely be a better bang for your buck if your goal was solely to reduce page weight, but my primary goal was to decrease request overhead and this was just a side benefit at no additional cost to me.<p>As an aside, I would say the non-technical benefit of the longer domain (4chan-cdn.org) would have been avoiding user confusion, but I feel this is mitigated since visiting 4cdn.org directly bounces you to www.4chan.org and our custom error pages make 4cdn.org clearly 4chan related.",1386010065

There was a time that the only information the public got about a company was their advertisements.<p>I subscribe to the notion that this particular stunt was both, technology investigation and PR piece. It sets Amazon apart from Walmart as &quot;new technology&quot; which carries a bit of cachet with the buying public, and there are some very real and interesting questions that can be informed by building a prototype system (which refers back to our discussion a while ago about actually doing something to figure out how hard it is <i>really</i>) and since it is so far out all it does is cause worry on the part of competitors.<p>Seems like a reasonable strategy to me.<p>[1] A blog post arguing some technology demo is a PR stunt",1386009145

I tried three questions:<p>Understanding the first rested on the fact that a friend function declaration requires that the relevant function declaration be present above it in the translation unit (e.g. friend int A::foo();&quot; requires that &quot;class A&quot; be defined, even though the prototype is otherwise correct).  Meaningless trivia, and something every compiler will remind you about instantly and clearly.<p>The second one was pretty straightforward and basically about understanding that a superclass constructor is invoked before the subclass constructor.  That&#x27;s certainly important to understand, but in my experience rarely misunderstood except by true OO newbies (basically the same behavior has to hold for any static type system with inheritance).<p>The third called a public virtual function through a superclass pointer and expected you to recognize that declaring the derived function private in the subclass that the object belongs to didn&#x27;t matter.

Since I&#x27;ve been the one whining about poor inline documentation, I&#x27;ve taken a swing at improving things myself (<a href=""https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/commit/447d24403f461743c02ab58a11aed57a9b110082"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/commit/447d24403f461743...</a>), because if I&#x27;m going to whine I better put up and make a change myself.

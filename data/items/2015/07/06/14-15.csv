I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it. Then I load up a track and notice that the vocals are missing. Completely. The backing track&#x27;s there, but the singer isn&#x27;t. I switch back to my old headphones. Yup, the singer&#x27;s there. I call my cow orkers over to verify that I&#x27;m not simply going mad. I&#x27;m not; they hear it too.<p>What was happening, we eventually discovered, was that I hadn&#x27;t noticed that the headphones used a three-ring jack rather than an ordinary two-ring stereo jack, and when plugged in to a two-ring socket, the left and right channels were being shorted together. Because the singer was in the centre of the mix, his vocals were in opposite phases in the two channels, and were therefore cancelling out. The backing track was offset left and right from centre, and so weren&#x27;t.<p>Phase artifacts are weird.",1436193664

When I got the email from namecheap, I did use their template, but I immediately assumed it would be tossed into /dev/null.<p>If you aren&#x27;t aware, ICANN has recently been pushing to remove themselves from their US contract, supposedly at the behest of other countries who don&#x27;t like the idea of US governance of the system. My problem though is that I don&#x27;t see any clear explanation of why this is actually needed, and I see plenty of reasons why keeping it under US oversight is a good thing.<p>For example, has ICANN formed an independent outside auditor or oversight body to replace the functions the US has traditionally performed? Good luck wading through their website to figure that out. I&#x27;ve even heard ICANN members say that it&#x27;s merely &quot;symbolic&quot;, so that other countries will trust ICANN more. That doesn&#x27;t make sense though, when there are some quantifiable differences in operation and oversight under the new governance model.<p>From PcWorld <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/2142460/us-ntias-plan-to-end-icann-contract-puts-internet-freedom-at-risk-critics-say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2142460/us-ntias-plan-to-end-...</a><p>&quot;Without the NTIA contract, there’s no limit on ICANN’s ability to raise fees on its domain-name system services, added Daniel Castro, senior analyst at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a tech-focused think tank.<p>“Without U.S. oversight, ICANN has the potential to grow into the world’s largest unregulated monopoly,” he said. “We should be very mindful of creating a global organization with little accountability that can effectively tax the Internet.”<p>The participants in ICANN would not allow the organization to become an unregulated monopoly, Strickling countered. That view “totally disregards the presence of hundreds of stakeholders, thousands of stakeholders, who actually set the policies for ICANN,” he said. “If you’re saying [the groups involved] are all going to allow that to happen, then you’re basically saying you don’t believe in the multistakeholder model.”&quot;<p>Links for the curious:<p>ICANN Resources Page: <a href=""https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/agreements-en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/agreements-en</a><p>ICANN contract: <a href=""https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iana-contract-14aug06-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iana-contract-14...</a><p>ICANN Board: <a href=""https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/board-of-directors-2014-03-19-en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/board-of-directors-201...</a><p>If anyone has a good explanation of what they mean, in detail, by &quot;global multistakeholder community&quot;, and how those &quot;stakeholders&quot; will actually be able to influence ICANN, I would really like to see it.",1436193661

It&#x27;s a tricky maneuver but a part of every heli pilot&#x27;s training.<p>I doubt that it&#x27;s a viable strategy for light aircraft, though. The loss of airspeed from extracting energy out of the wind stream is more dangerous than gliding. Thermals aren&#x27;t powerful enough to keep a non-glider aircraft in flight as far as I know.<p>Large aircraft use a small windmill or a ram air turbine to keep hydraulics and electrics up in case of a loss of power, though.",1436193084

Regular maintenance limits this; and the maintenance prescribed even for light aircraft keeps it to a minimum.<p>Still, no system is ever 100% reliable. The typical safeguard for engine failure in light aicraft is to glide to a safe landing. Starting with basic training, you&#x27;ll do so repeatedly (starting from the vicinity of a landing strip, of course) and should be able to bring a plane down safely. Some (very) light planes even include a parachute system that&#x27;ll bring down the plane in a manner safe for its occupants.<p>Speaking as a private pilot with little experience, this systems seems promising to me in two respects: In the case of a failed engine, it&#x27;ll take you another 20 km or so. This can make the difference between a survivable landing in a field somewhere and a completely safe landing on the closest airstrip. Additionally, you get 40 hp or so of available power in situations where you need it, like taking off or going around after a botched landing. This could allow for shorter runways and help speed your initial climb, which is generally considered one of the most dangerous phases of flight: At that point you are both flying slow and low, and both speed and altitude are important safety aids. After a cursory first look, this system appears to be a considerable improvement in safety while avoiding much of the complexities a true twin engine system would entail.",1436193050

The fact that GS was backstopped by the public in this case, and that their ownership of Treasury had so much to do with that (<i>now</i> I see why a knucklehead like Geithner was fast-tracked into his current position), will inspire not just GS to keep doing the same thing, but everyone else in the market to emulate them. Next time around, all the amounts will be bigger, maybe even big enough to break the nation, but since everyone at every department and agency will be a puppet of some financial firm, our reaction will be even more corrupt. All because Bush the Lesser didn&#x27;t have the stones to tell Paulson to go pound sand when he started his high-pressure sales routine. The seeds of future disaster were planted during this pretend disaster.<p>I&#x27;ve heard all the whining about pension funds and whatnot, but surely they weren&#x27;t all all-in on GS and its ilk?

A couple of issues I ran into:<p>1) if you have an empty blank line after a query, you get a syntax error<p>2) an option to expand column widths to match column name would be nice.<p>3) Perhaps I&#x27;m not getting it, but for ad hoc sql queries, I&#x27;d prefer a free form text window a la Toad or Squirrel, where the query that the cursor is on is the current query to be executed (via key binding). I switch back and forth between queries a lot, and it&#x27;s useful to be able view several of them simultaneously. The current interface is feels way too limited and clumsy, imho. Being able to go forward/back in history is nice (though I need to be able to rebind the shortcut, as ctrl-cmd-left/ctrl-cmd-right are both bound to Spectacle), but not sufficient, imho. You need to be able to view multiple queries at a time.<p>4) An optional &#x27;auto-limit&#x27; is an awesome feature of squirrel that allows you to do all sorts of queries quickly without having to always type &quot;limit 1&quot; or whatnot. I had forgotten how much I had relied on it until I tried using this and kept accidentally getting giant result sets.<p>5) Another nice to have (also in Squirrel) - autocomplete.<p>6) If you could pull up and instasearch the query history with like cmd-P (like sublime or atom) or something that would be amazing.<p>7) Essential: allow user to remap/redefine keyboard shortcuts.<p>Keep going!

Lesson&#x27;s learned: 1) It&#x27;s no way to live, but a good way to start, as the userbase was at it&#x27;s most vocal with feedback back then, when we were trying to hit product/market fit (perhaps because &#x27;donation ware&#x27; felt much more community-spirited). 2) I don&#x27;t have exact conversion numbers, but I do remember being surprised by how much an individual donated ($1 was the minimum, $30 the average, $300 the max). I&#x27;ve read studies since that if someone is asked to name their own price, they&#x27;ll be much more generous (the downside being not as many people will pay anything at all).<p>We then tried <i>freemium</i> (features were restricted until people paid). Lesson&#x27;s learnt: 1) Do freemium by resource constraints, not feature constraints (i.e. all features are available, but when you use X amount of data you have to pay). Because otherwise users just see a &#x27;broken&#x27; product, and don&#x27;t see the point in paying for something less-useful. 2) We also noticed that most people quit in the first two weeks, and almost everyone who didn&#x27;t, paid. I.e. the &#x27;free plan&#x27; was hardly used (related to the first point). Thus it was just a maintenance burden.<p>Now we have a two week <i>trial</i>, and then you pay. Lesson&#x27;s learnt: 1) Benchmarked against freemium, conversion increased 4% in real terms (and 20% in relative terms). Mostly because it nudged the small % of &#x27;free plan&#x27; folks from above into buying.<p>[1] www.activeinboxhq.com",1436191769

One kind, as you mention it, is the less exciting part of the work, be it writing docs, or some edge case bugs, etc. The other kind is when you discover that you largely underestimated the complexity, or saw some major flaws in the initial idea. Like I&#x27;ve mentioned in my previous comment, maybe you start working on a game and find out some major flaws in the gameplay and can&#x27;t see it being a fun game to play anymore.

If a friend of mine has a gun I could go on a rampage shooting, but I&#x27;m probably less likely to do it on impulse. If anybody in my household owns a gun I can likely go on a rampage shooting whenever I like. But if I own 10 guns I don&#x27;t see how that makes a rampage shooting any more likely.<p>The proper statistic would be rampage shooting per household with at least one gun.

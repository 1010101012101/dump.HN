Our electronic ballot machines are ridiculously outdated, and are not auditable by anyone outside controlled closed-door situations. When glaring flaws are found, they&#x27;re quickly dismissed by the government, saying they &#x27;can&#x27;t&#x27; happen in a real environment.<p>It&#x27;s Diebold hardware and closed source software. Diebold had it&#x27;s voting machines banned in the US.<p>The new mandatory biometric identification system to prevent fraud is completely &#x27;side-steppable&#x27;, just as before. Voters are required to re-register for voting again, and upon registration have their fingerprints taken (all ten digits) and a high resolution picture.<p>The software used to hold and manipulate all this biometric data is the same used by our Federal Police, which is the same used by the FBI.<p>The STE (a department which manages ALL aspects of elections) has an agreement to share all this data with Policia Federal, and which in turn have an agreement with the FBI!<p>The biggest bribery scheme discovered here, the &#x27;mensalão&#x27;, used government money to pay out bribes to the oposition. One of the heads of this criminal organization, José Dirceu, is serving time in a semi-closed regime.<p>He got a job as a hotel manager during the day.

They also owned GnuPG&#x27;s RSA earlier with the same technique [1]. On the other hand, if your argument is that ECC implementations are generally less mature, I can&#x27;t disagree with that. I believe that ECC (using Edwards or Montgomery forms; debatable when using general Weierstrass form) is easier to get right with respect to solid implementations than RSA is.<p>With respect to theoretical attacks, it is of course impossible to know what the future brings. But as long as we&#x27;re sticking with conservative prime fields, I think it&#x27;s probably either going to be fine or all of ECC is dead. It&#x27;s also not like integer factorization or discrete logs have reached some kind of complexity lower bound; it&#x27;s certainly not impossible that we&#x27;ll get a L(1/4) method in the future as well.

As much as I don&#x27;t like the idea of incumbents using their weight to protect against innovative competition, is this not just the nature of a strategic view of competitive advantage?

Without these barriers being possible, incumbents would presumably create barriers in a different manner (through acquisition etc)? It&#x27;s not like massive incumbents will whither and die because they can&#x27;t encourage legislation to be adopted, it&#x27;s just a currently effective strategy.<p>Secondly, a semantic point, it talks about &#x27;disruptive innovations&#x27;, but surely the key characteristics of disruptive innovations, at least in the sense that Christensen described them, is that incumbents either don&#x27;t see the value in them or else the product targets a segment with a low-performance product that incumbents don&#x27;t see the threat of.<p>Tesla and Uber don&#x27;t seem to fit this bill for me, they seem more like <i>maybe</i> sustaining and radical innovations, respectively, and I don&#x27;t think existing value networks will be affected.

It needs accountability.<p>Throwing money at a generic &quot;charity&quot; initiative is the best way to see your money disappear in the pockets of a handful of corrupted individuals.<p>When giving for charity, you need to be able to see what exactly results from what you gave.<p>Say, $10 million required to build a hospital with this and that, all written in specs, and by year 2016. People pool money, and if the funding goal is reached, the providers keep the people <i>taking</i> the money accountable to build the hospital to specs.<p>And not &quot;give for charity&quot;, feel good, go back to your life, and achieve <i>absolutely nothing</i> because no one is held accountable.<p>The latter is what 90% of charity is like.

7441572,comment,7437940,7438681,1,0,onetwofiveten,,,"The big problem with corporations (as far as I see it) is that they act as a dehumanising mechanism for representing shareholders. An individual who has tight control over a company (like Elon Musk) can shoot for long term goals in order to achieve their noble aspirations. However, in most cases, the legal obligation of the directors of a corporation to represent the interests of their shareholders seems to default to purely financial interests. A board of directors aren&#x27;t really obligated to represent the humanitarian or altruistic interests of their shareholders. In fact, typically financial interests are only served in the short term.<p>This means the capital that a shareholder represents is only ever set to work to meet financial interests. It&#x27;s up to the shareholder to then divert their profit from their own investments into charities. This seems very inefficient to me.<p>My solution is to include a much richer mechanism for representing shareholder interests locked into the company charter. Shareholders could vote on what things they valued, and on values that they assign to those things. Then, instead of a quarterly bottom line that represents monetary value, the bottom line would also include those externalities that the shareholders voted on.<p>For example, you could have a company where most investors were patriots who cared about the economy. They could vote to assign a value to every month of employment that the company provides to an American worker. So, when the bottom line was calculated, each full time worker was treated like an extra source of income. This means when the board of directors considers whether or not to close down a factor and outsource to Mexico, the reduction in costs has to justify the expense to the patriot virtues of the investors.<p>The obvious objection is that if you only valued jobs you might run a company into the ground. However, running the company into the ground also gets rid of all the jobs. So it&#x27;s not something the board of directors would want to do. Balancing short term gains over long term company growth is something directors have to do anyway.<p>This example really illustrates the power of this approach. In our current system, a company can move a factory to Mexico even if all its shareholders want to keep jobs in the USA. Those shareholders could then earn a significant amount of dividends from the move, and then try to invest those dividends charitably in order to express their patriotic virtues. However, no charity is going to be able to replace all those lost jobs for the price of those dividends. Charities just aren&#x27;t efficient and reliable enough.<p>A valuable addition to the charter would be to make it so that the votes and results were made public. People who claim themselves job-creators would be able to put their money where their mouth is - and called to account if they failed to do so.",1395399740

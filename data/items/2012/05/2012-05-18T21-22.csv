According to [1] over half the money is going to existing stockholders rather than the company.<p>That being said, Facebook doesn't actually need the cash for anything (apparent). It is profitable and can hire and build data centers.<p>For a company in Facebook's position, any large cash pile is likely to be used for acquisitions more than anything else.<p>But the share price still matters. It affects the company's ability to attract and retain talent.<p>In the 90s Microsoft did amazingly well from this. IIRC at the time an employee's stock options were price at the lowest closing price in the month after they joined. This meant that someone who joined in around 1990 could buy MSFT at less than $1 when it was trading at 50-100 times.<p>It is <i>very</i> hard for someone to leave in that kind of position.<p>AFAIK option vesting and pricing has changed somewhat since then (typically with the whole 4 year vest and 1 year cliff) such that early employees are probably fully-vested. Later share parcels won't be anywhere nearly as attractive. So those employees will stay basically as long as it's fun because it's not about the money anymore.<p>Then again, good luck motivating such people to do shitty jobs.<p>Facebook is now (IMHO) beyond the point where stock can be considered a lottery ticket anymore. Even it becomes a trillion dollar company that's still only 10x. At this point, a potential employee can simply multiply his or her RSU (restricted stock unit) allotment by the current price divide it by the vesting period and add that to base compensation plus target bonus to work out total comp.<p>Zuck still holds 57% of the voting power in Facebook so really the stockmarket doesn't matter much at all to Facebook. It's still Zuck's company and he can (within reason) do what he likes with it. That seems to be a tech company norm and probably a good thing based on the short-term narrowsighted thinking that seems to dominate Wall Street (just look at Yahoo).<p>TL:DR effect on FB = not a lot.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303448404577407774136362662.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405270230344840457740...</a>",1337377211

This is why Turing looked not at single formal theories but at a hierarchy of consistency extensions of the initial theory. In other words, the game changes from formal provability to <i>informal</i> provability, and from provability relative to a set of axioms to absolute provability. Turing showed (very roughly) that given a tree of consistency extensions (which branches only at limit stages) every Pi_1 sentence was decided at some point a with |a| =  + 1. Feferman then proved in the 1960s that there is a path through the tree of ordinal notations that decides every Pi_2 sentence. These are completeness results, albeit for progressions of formal systems rather than individual systems. So certainly the puzzle can never be completed <i>within a single formal system</i>, but by restricting to sentences of limited complexity, there is an ordinal-time operation which decides each sentence (obviously there are numerous philosophical problems with this, although I'm afraid my expertise in this area is extremely limited so I can only give a sketch of the issues involved).",1337376484

Gruber's emphasis has always been on ""quality,"" ""being the best,"" and ""being right"" in everything he does. Thus the only light through which I can see this decision is his belief that the show is better without Dan. Their relationship throughout The Talk Show has had its tumultuous moments: in early episodes, Benjamin's using an Android phone drew Gruber's ire, and then later there was animosity when Benjamin would show up for the Bond episodes unprepared. Gruber would accuse Dan of ""yeah yeahing"" his co-hosts and contributing little in the way of earnest dissent.<p>On the other hand, I always had the sense that Benjamin regarded Gruber as a kneejerk Apple apologist, and this too could not have helped their relationship.<p>But their differences led to the show's magic. Their contrasting styles would turn the show into a focused, intimate meditation on Gruber's thoughts on industry (plus side interests of baseball, Kubrick, etc.), often serving as a preview of what written work would be to come on Daring Fireball. While it can come across as aloofness, Dan has the passive ability to subtly guide the conversation and give it some sense of structure, and he's great at knowing when to let the other person speak. There were also incredibly funny moments of East Coast camaraderie that would keep the side topics interesting and lively.<p>It seems that Gruber has taken all of this for granted in deciding his show is better without Benjamin.

There is a reason Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple- he is an operations expert, and Apple is largely a business built on outstanding operations and sourcing. Companies like Wal-Mart aren't as widely discussed as the Facebook's of the world, but the reality is that the Wal-Mart's do a whole lot more to improve our daily lives, and are far more difficult to run.

My advice echoes and negates several of the comments already posted:<p>- I agree that, at best, you should launch something in a space you know about (ie oil) or at least in a vertical you are very interested in. However I would be less concerned about how ""lucrative"" the market is (as one commenter suggested), other than the fact that there is a market. Many businesses have been started in markets one wouldn't typically associate with ""lucrative"" - selling to teachers is one example.  
- Instead focus on creating value or solving a problem. Seems obvious but so often startups try to find problems for their solution that they've built. I've been guilty of this myself.
- Don't angel invest. That is a good way to lose your position and some money. Plus you imply that your more interested in entrepreneurship anyway.
- Learn how to code a little, even if you plan on finding technical co-founders or paying someone to build your product. It gives you perspective and depth while making you better at properly scoping projects for others.<p>Best of luck",1337375794

I disagree on two points:<p>1. Pre-IPO investors expect an immediate return. Investment banks (""IBs"") underwriting IPOs will be selling those shares to their most valued clients (in large part). Those clients expect an immediate return. Also there is a nontrivial number of ""stag"" investors in IPOs (investors who do first-day sales to trade on this bump);<p>2. The IPO itself can in large part in set the tone. A stock that jumps 50% on IPO sets expectations as a stock that's going places. A stock that drops can have everyone for the hills and a stock that's level can just make everyone nervous (becoming a prisoner's dilemma);<p>3. There's evidence the IBs are propping up the stock at issue price levels; and<p>4. Current investors will have a lock-out period from selling. This may be 6 or 12 months. Whatever the case, if supply meets demand now then extra supply suggests a price drop may be coming when that lock-out period ends.<p>Consider this: Even <i>Groupon</i> jumped 25% on first-day trading.<p>Now I'm not predicting doom and gloom here. In all honesty I have no idea what will happen with the stock. I do consider it a high-risk investment at this point and personally I wouldn't touch it. YMMV. It may still be spectacularly well. OTOH it could be the Beijing Olympics of the tech sector (the Beijing Olympics being essentially the turning point of the economy in 2008).<p>Trading at a P/E of ~100:1 is high risk. Make no mistake. Facebook has important strategic issues they need to deal with.<p>Anyway, to those early employees, congratulations. This will change the life for many (and already has).

It would be an ambitious idea if Windows phone (or tablet!) was well established and had a decent amount of market share but, as things stand, it's appears almost insane.  MS is taking a huge risk with their core market to expand into markets that they're almost completely locked out of at present.<p>However, if you look at the trends in computing its absolutely true that more and more is being done on mobile devices, often at the expense of the desktop.

Well... what if Facebook starts providing a neat little bit of code that also embeds an ad? If the Like button knows who you are... so will the ad widget. So now they are serving ""Facebook ads"" on other sites. Of course that is what Google does with AdSense... but does Google know as much about <i>you</i> on that page as it does about that page? I could see it <i>possible</i> for Facebook to grab eyeballs on other sites... sites that are currently monetizing with AdSense. Not that I'm convinced they would make a dent with this approach... but you can't just compare the ads ON Facebook to the ads on Google search. If Facebook was putting the ads on pages that had a different focus than what you do on Facebook... there is a chance.",1337375007

You talk about companies spending money because they are stupid.  I SUSPECT, but only Facebook has the data to KNOW, that there is a high turnover in companies advertising on Facebook.  New companies coming in every day, but also many who realize they aren't getting a return on investment and leaving.  I think a lot of big companies advertise on it strictly for brand presence, rather than for direct sales.  That's fine.  But let's not pretend that there is remotely the click-thru rate that Google has.",1337374984

That the end result is a diminishing return in the long run for the country, or region as a whole.  This being caused by a lack of ""long-term tech investment.""<p>However, the striking problem with the statement is that it is not backed up by data.  How much money that would've been invested in ""core"" technology (technology used to enable other technology), pharmaceutical, or other investments was instead funneled for short-term gains into social start-ups?  I'd understand that if one just read tech news, one might think all investment goes to SV software firms these days, but I have a hard time believing that's a fact and not just a matter of media selection.",1337374977

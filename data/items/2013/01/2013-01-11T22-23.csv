First of all, you can't have a website with significant traffic and no revenue unless you explicitly make it that way, like Twitter.  However, Twitter had lots of funding which made that possible, and even still, I'm sure they made <i>some</i> money even though they weren't serving up sponsored tweets.<p>Why don't you tell your friend to put 3 AdSense units on the website and you'll take all of that revenue in exchange for your work + 5% of the option pool that vests in 1 year?<p>It seems like you have stars in your eyes and are being almost completely taken advantage of.

5045459,comment,5044669,5044669,2,0,AllTheThings,,,"I hope, perhaps naively, that the positive focus this article gets on HackerNews seeds if not the beginning of change but at least the awareness of just how terrible Silicon Valley transit is.<p>I'm native to the Bay Area but am studying my Masters in Computer Science outside of California and come back every so often to interview, visit friends, and help out my family. Both of my parents work so I don't have access to their cars. I've never had a car (only driven my parents cars on weekends in high school) and because I'll be finishing up my education soon I haven't felt the need to buy one of my own. For reference, I live with my parents currently in the San Jose / Morgan Hill beyond the commonly serviced Caltrains zones (but still in their extra commute-serviced zones).<p>Visiting friends, attending interviews, or just taking in the sights somewhere is something I've gotten used to doing on public transit since I've never had a car. The VTA is awful. Most of their schedules use timepoints rather than actual stops for scheduling (is this the case to allow busses slack time in between timepoints?), even on the Light Rail which is not as traffic sensitive as the bus. My nearby Light Rail station isn't even listed on the the schedules for most of the VTA schedules.<p>Google Maps is just awful at planning trips using VTA. It takes a definite know-how of how the system works to use it effectively. In contrast to what other posts have discussed, using Caltrains to get to San Francisco makes the trip from San Jose to San Francisco relatively painless; I take a 30 minute bus to a Caltrains stop and take a train directly into San Francisco. The main San Jose transit hub (and the best serviced Caltrains stop in the area), the San Jose Diridon, is inaccessible on my Light Rail route, the Blue Line (or the 901). To reach Diridon I can either take a bus from another nearby transit station or take the Blue Line North to the SJ Convention Center, transfer to the Green line, and then go South. Using the Light Rail exclusively is a death sentence however. Using the Light Rail to move from my Light Rail station to Mountain View takes <i>2 hours</i>. Making the detour at the Convention Center to switch Lines and then using Caltrains is still faster.<p>Trying to visit Santana Row is awful. I take the Light Rail to a stop from where I can take a bus (the 323) which takes me to Santana Row, all in all a 15-20 minute drive from my home under normal conditions. To visit a friend in Union City I have to take the Light Rail then transfer to a bus (the 181), then transfer to BART Fremont and ride BART to BART Union City. We live, ostensibly, 25 min. away in normal traffic, but actually live 3-4 transfers of public transit away. Awful.<p>Safety is another huge issue on the VTA but a smaller issue on BART and mostly nonexistent on Caltrains. I rarely feel safe enough to take out my expensive smartphone on VTA. If I can get onto the Caltrains quickly the increase in fare is worth the safety I have to now use my electronics. BART is a mixed bag, but is definitely safe enough.<p>That said, VTA is cheap. An 8 hour Light Rail pass is $4, and a single bus ride is $2. I can take a single bus to downtown Palo Alto and back and spend $4 on the round trip. I can ride into downtown San Jose and pay $2 - $4 depending on how long I stay, pay nothing for parking, and not have to worry about my car at all. A trip into San Francisco is expensive ($22 round trip, $18 for two Caltrains trips, and $4 for two VTA bus rides), but is still cheaper than gas and parking isn't an issue.<p>I really wish the various local governments in the Valley took charge of things and created a safe, unified transit system. The Clipper Card has gone a long way in making it much more painless to endure the many transfers needed to get from my home to any location of interest. It's hard though. The suburbs of the Bay Area is very much dominated by cars.",1357943393

Add that to low barriers to start a competitor, and we had HUNDREDS of Groupon clones in 2010.<p>Take Uber. Many people think that they're doing well - high ASP, thousands of vigilant customers (thousands took to Twitter to protest Washington DC legislation that would ban Uber).

In fact, Locke starts by arguing against people (Filmer and others) who were saying something of the like that the monarchs of the time had an irrevocable right to rule (and presumably to own everything under the skies), handed down (the right to rule) to them from generation to generation since Adam (the Genesis Adam).

Most NHL talent development is done through an extensive farm system affiliated with and financially supported by their NHL teams, similar in some but not all respects to the MLB.<p>Prospects pursuing the NCAA route vs junior leagues and the AHL are widely regarded as inferior, facing significantly less stiff competition. A typical player (ie, more than 50% of current players) would grow up advancing through various levels of midget hockey, forgo college to play in one of the CHL leagues (QMJHL, WHL, OHL), from which they would be drafted by an NHL team and assigned to their AHL or ECHL affiliate. This is true even of international players, who are often sent from their home countries to stay with Canadian host families while playing in the Canadian junior leagues.<p>Making the NHL out of NCAA is the exception, rather than the rule.

I slowly realized that this new product <i>was</i> the company.  Everything else was water under the bridge.<p>However, the company (and certainly its investors) didn't see it that way.  They'd invested a lot of time and money.  To them, the idea that I would have as much stock as someone who had been there for 7 years seemed unfair.<p>The company badly needed new funding, and it all fell apart for this very reason.  Someone offered to put in a lot of dough.  The existing investors and stockholders figured, ok, you're offering about 10% of what we've put into this company, so you get 10%.  Okay, 15%.<p>The investor figured, no, that's all water under the bridge.  The money I invest now is almost a brand new investment.  I need way more than that.  They couldn't reach a deal and the startup folded.<p>You may be in a similar spot.  Your buddy, and all his employees, figure they've been at it for 5 years.  But does that 5 years have any meaning, or is it just dead weight?<p>You did say that they have ""significant traffic"", so maybe there is a lot of value already there, and you'll be building on top of something already successful.  Or maybe there's nothing, and you're essentially starting a new company but with all the baggage of a failed company.<p>Hard to say, but this is what it all turns on, as far as I can see.",1357942081

I don't care much for Singapore and don't usually think about it outside of HN. Much like I don't think about Peru or Qatar or Sweden.

5817231,comment,5814755,5816606,0,0,CoolGuySteve,,,"I work on an extremely latency sensitive application.  The choice of Windows predates me, and frankly, it was a massive mistake.  I am never working on Windows again after this job.<p>Here's some feedback for low latency development in Visual Studio.  Try not to take it personally, I don't hate you, I just hate every MSVC I've ever used:<p>- With a profiler, we typically see only a few hundred samples in our simulation runs, the rest, between 99.999% and 99.99999% of the samples are in WaitForSingleObject.  PGO compiles only 0.4% of our application for speed, and our response times are about 20 usecs slower with it on.<p>- RE xperf (and WinDbg): Stop bundling this shit in ""Toolkits"".  The installers/downloaders are buggy as fuck and break the main VS2012 installer; I don't want to run a bunch of random msi files on our prod server core box; and the download pages are a maze of redirects.<p>- __assume is so useless.  How often does someone write a branch that does nothing every time?  We <i>need</i> manual size/speed optimization.<p>- PogoAutoSweep crashes threaded programs if you don't suspend every other thread but it's still quasi documented.  The PogoSafeMode build flag/environment appears to be ignored.<p>- The filename postfix that PogoAutoSweep adds breaks the VS2012 PGO menu options.<p>- The VS2012 PGO instrumented/optimized menu items overwrite the target exe.  So when you realize somethings wrong in the environment or click something by mistake and didn't manually reshuffle the build dir, you have to rebuild everything.  Name the target .instrument.exe or put it in another or something please.<p>- There's nothing one can do to limit the VS2012 profiler to specific threads.  I was able to write hooks to target threads in VerySleepy in an afternoon, but somehow this feature escapes MS.<p>- The interface for instrumenting specific functions is terrible, use a plain text file or decl_spec FFS.<p>- If there are #defines or other ways to detect an instrumented build, they're terribly documented.<p>- PGO instrumentation/optimization is woefully obtuse.  What did it pick for speed?  Why did it pick it?  What branches did it fold/unfold?  How does the pgc weighting actually work?  Can I artificially create my own pgc?<p>A perl script that compares the offsets in objdump will give me more information than most of the MSDN articles about this shit.<p>- Not related to our main response loop, but we can see in our logging threads that the LFH malloc appears to often call RtlAnsiStringToUnicodestring.  Seriously, what the fuck?<p>- Speaking of which, changing the malloc implementation is still horrible even after the VS2010 msvcrt changes.  In linux, you can change LD_PRELOAD and try out tcmalloc or the Intel tbb allocator in about 3 minutes.  In Visual Studio, prepare to spend a few hours getting a reasonably large project to build with these.<p>- Why is there SemaphoreSlim in C# but not C++?  Why is there no Benaphore primitive that can also be used in WaitForMultipleObjects?<p>- Serious issues in Microsoft Developer Connect are often ignored, closed as behaves as expected, or dismissed off hand.  For example, I was tearing my hair out over this one, and the resolution is truly outrageous: <a href=""http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/772408/cant-include-stdio-h-among-others-after-installing-vs2012-update-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/7...</a><p>I am certain that this comment on Hacker News will make a bigger impact than anything I've ever seen on Microsoft Connect.<p>- RE Instrumenting profilers/bounds checkers: Any project that is reasonably large and has multiple configs/3rd party libraries is bad enough to manage in vanilla Visual Studio that instrumenting it with some other 3rd party plugin becomes a serious time sink.<p>- There is still no valgrind/cachegrind equivalent that provides the same level of detail.  The closest thing is either Intel Pin or Rational Purify/Quantify and they are expensive and poor substitutes.  Microsoft is the only company that can see and modify the source of the kernel, runtime, linker, and machine code generation, so I don't know who else they expect to write this for them.<p>- Our statically linked application takes 20 minutes link and the link is not parallel.  C++ compiles are likewise brutally slow.  We resort to developing in VS2008 and compiling release stuff in VS2012.  And no, I'm not going to turn on precompiled headers, MSVC builds incorrect binaries about 5% of the time as it is.<p>- Concerning precompiled headers, sharing a single pch file across projects or strictly controlling a single vcproj/vcxproj with the compiled unit is de facto impossible.",1370310568

Maybe they can get their way and we can go through 100 years or so of believing that the A-bomb was not the proximate cause of the end of WWII.

He could no more have stopped it than a train moving down a track. It's all well and good to come along later and say the bomb was a horrible thing.

For a game, that means demonstrating a gameplay concept that may be worthwhile to expand upon.<p>Thinking about early Minecraft, the creative version became an MVP in my mind when it got multiplayer and a variety of building blocks; the gameplay element there being working with others to create artwork. The survival version became an MVP when it added monsters and an infinitely generating world, which allowed exploration and, well, survival.<p>But if you look at Skycraft today, it's billed as a ""creative voxel adventure game"", but there's no adventure. It fails the basic test of what defines a game: there is no gameplay. It needs some sort of basic challenge to overcome, goal to reach, or ruleset by which to reach a win or lose state (to be clear, it doesn't need to be a fully fleshed out concept or demonstration: Pong is an MVP for a tennis game).<p>Skycraft does, however, demonstrate a very cool block-building generator done in HTML5. That's a very cool tech demo, but it's not yet a proof-of-concept of a game.<p>To get to an MVP, it needs to add some gameplay elements. If it's supposed to be an adventure game, there needs to be some sort of undertaking or goal to work towards played out through an experience the player has.<p>But beyond that, if you're going to try to create something that's a new spin on Minecraft and show there's an unmet demand for it, I think you have to demonstrate at least one gameplay element that Minecraft doesn't have. Skycraft doesn't have that yet.<p>And there's definitely a strong case to be made that there's a demand for games like Minecraft that have a different vision: there's at least a half-dozen ""ripoffs"", just as many (if not more) games that can directly trace their lineage through Minecraft, and hundreds of mods for Minecraft proper that radically change how the game works.<p>I almost wonder if you are interested in creating a new take on Minecraft, the easiest way to get to an MVP is to create a mod for it first and worry about the engine after you have something that's fun.",1370309090

5817147,comment,5815567,5816979,2,0,simonster,,,"Right. If you're spending a lot of time in the CPython interpreter, you probably don't care too much about performance anyway. The CPython interpreter is a hell of a lot slower than using Numba or Cython (which can operate without the GIL) or PyPy (which is an completely separate codebase from CPython, although it still has a GIL in its typical incarnation), or many alternative languages. As soon as you're out of the interpreter, the GIL ceases to be an issue (e.g. NumPy releases the GIL while performing array operations).",1370308798

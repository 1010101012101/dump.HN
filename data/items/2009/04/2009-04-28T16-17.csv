Other times you can't.<p>Lesson 2: Not all parts of your life will be ideal at all times.<p>Lesson 3: Any complex system that uses human beings as input will be non-ideal for many (if not most) of those people.<p>Lesson 4: Humanity's sacred institutions are (contrary to the way they're marketed) full of frustrating inefficiencies and design flaws.<p>You're frustrated because you'd like to be constantly challenged by just the right amount so that you can learn and reach your potential.

583499,comment,583159,583159,0,0,jneal,,,"I can tell you that I had a very similar experience in high school. I am currently 24 years old and working in a career/job that I absolute love. But high school was a bit different. I wasn't a straight A student, but that's simply because most of the topics we discussed were completely uninteresting to me. And you are right, some teachers can really ruin a subject even if you like it. I was lucky enough to have a few good teachers each year and I was able to graduate without any problem, but I definitely can see where you are coming from.<p>My suggestion to you is first to forget about dropping out of high school. That is not even a possibility. Now that we have that established, I will move on.<p>This might not help your grades, but one thing I used to do is actually work on personal projects while I was at school. I would write on paper, that I was supposed to be taking notes with, ideas and brainstorms for my projects. I would sometimes get so bored in school I would actually write out Perl code on paper just for the heck of it. Yea I was bored.<p>Sorry to digress, basically what I'm trying to say is make due with what you have. If you can't take more challenging classes like honors or AP level courses, perhaps ask around to find out who the more interesting and passionate teachers are and if you have an honest talk with the principal they may actually move you to the class you'd like. Work on your own stuff and your own knowledge while at school. Find others that are interested in those same things you are as well. When I was in high school I joined a webstaff which was basically a group of students that worked on the website. The media center/library people quickly spotted my overall technology talent, and I soon because very literally the school's IT guy. By my 12th grade year, I was practically spending half of my time 'working' at school helping people with computer related issues.<p>In closure, I have a feeling there are other issues at hand here. I don't quite know what I'm suggesting, maybe personal issues at home or maybe something totally different. Try to figure out what's at the root of your disliking. There is probably an underlying cause that you may be able to fix. Stop worrying so much about high school. Just pass and do good on your SAT. By the way, you're first two years of college, if you go, will be very similar. But when you actually take those nice tech classes where you really learn stuff it is highly enjoyable.",1240937453

583497,comment,583159,583159,0,0,jsonmiller,,,"So the goal is to reduce your boredom in class, which is probably easiest to do by giving you something else to do while you're there and/or reduce the amount of time you're there because public schools are a disaster for smart kids (ref <a href=""http://sex-death-and.com/blog/?p=17"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sex-death-and.com/blog/?p=17</a>).  Okay.<p>First of all, unless something's changed, you should be able to have a driver's license by grade 11 (usually age 16).  You can use this to take Community College courses.  If you are feeling really clever, you can work with your school to get credit for these such that you don't have to take the HS versions -- but they also count as college credit, which we call ""huge tuition savings"" on the other side of the bill.<p>Second of all, you need to be participating in socializing activities.  I'm a big fan of speech & debate (because there's not a job opening in the world that doesn't have ""strong communication skills"" as a prerequisite :-p -- the movie Rocket Science is a not-unreasonable depiction of the activity), but I've seen/heard that robotics and electronics clubs are becoming popular thanks to more-accessible components and information.  If those don't strike your fancy or aren't available, then make your own.  Do you realize how cheap a digital camcorder and video editing software is these days?  Round up some people that don't suck and make a movie.  I've had a whole bunch of friends that have done it, some in HS and others in College (see: ""The Gamers"" which was surprisingly profitable and ""The Gamers: Dorkness Rising"").<p>Third, if you're lucky then you're in a college town and if you're as smart as you claim then you may be able to be a lab aide for professors at that college.  You don't have to want to go to school there, but getting in on that kind of experience is very valuable and also looks great on applications to the colleges that you do want to go to.  (My youngest sister-in-law did this.)<p>Fourth, I would speculate that because you're posting here and you're reading Paul and all this other stuff that you're not very well diversified in how you're trying to challenge yourself.  Let me remind you that an awful lot of technical jobs didn't exist when those of us filling them were kids, so really drilling into specialized knowledge when you're a kid may have a detrimental impact on your ability to adjust to certain change later in life.  I would suggest that you spend more time doing art, music, writing, etc.  (Consider: Paul Graham would almost certainly not be so capable of a writer if he hadn't gone wacky and gotten his degree in Philosophy.  Also, if you doubt the value of art, go read Mac Hall -- there's a party sequence where Ian demonstrates the value of competence with a sketchpad at a party that always makes me grin. <a href=""http://www.machall.com/view.php?date=2001-03-21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.machall.com/view.php?date=2001-03-21</a>)  The crucial thing is that you can bring in another skill that you've cultured to make your particular synthesis of capabilities unique and innovative.<p>Finally, it will almost certainly get easier.  Lacking any kind of public funding for talented and gifted programs, my senior year of HS was ~40% independent study of one form or another.  Not that I would suggest being quite the slacker I was -- I used the ""Theorem of Theorems"" which stated that ""if a state-certified math book taught it to us, it must be true enough"" to shortcut through entirely too many math problems -- but with a good mobile internet device and enough initiative to set your own goals, you'll be able to make better use of your time in the near future.",1240937379

583480,comment,583159,583159,0,0,DougWebb,,,"I was a lot like you. My advice would be to do what I wish I had done:<p>1. Use your intelligence and self-teaching skills to make sure you get the best grades possible; this will help you get financial aid for college. Otherwise, you'll be limited to cheap schools, saddled with debt, or unable to go at all.<p>2. When you have choices about which classes to take, take ones that stretch your creativity in areas you wouldn't normally explore: for a geek, that's probably art, music, literature, philosophy, wood shop, metal shop, etc. These classes will usually have you creating things which is fun, and if you're creating written papers, that's very good practice for your future.<p>3. Since you're smart, #1 shouldn't take up much of your time. While in classes you can't avoid, you can 'take notes' writing about something else you're working on. Pay just enough attention to the class to make sure you're following what's going on. Outside of class, SOCIALIZE. Learn to make girls smile at you (or boys, if that's your thing.) Learn how to make small talk, and how to get someone else to talk about themselves. Having good conversational skills, especially if you're introverted, will be hugely important for you in your future.",1240936937

So you will compulsively chase programming, trying to get your success fix.<p>Turn this around and get your success from school.

What I said is hardly a leap.  You have a funny definition of ""drastic proportions"".<p>> But no, you won't address the ideas I put forth. You'll nitpick. You'll be an absolute snot just so that you can gain the upper hand in an argument. And so you might reach a point where I and people like me get tired of your bullshit and walk away, and then you'll declare yourself the victor because you were the last person to make a post in my comment thread, but all you're doing is making the person on the other side want to punch yourself in the face...<p>You're descending into ad hominem territory here.

But now, it seems to me that you are not separating the issues of ""cause"" and ""blame"" the same way I am.<p>To be clear, of course the victims are part of the cause of any particular confrontation.  It couldn't happen if they weren't there, so there's at least that.  What I object to is assigning _blame_ to them.  Causes for these things are shared - blame is given to one side or the other for their own actions.<p>Your commentaries on battered wives and rape focus on what happens _after_ the incident.  I am asking about the incident itself.  The blame for the raping and the beating lies solely with the aggressors.<p>> Is McDonald's to blame for making people fat?

During Mao's rule, all the schools were shut down while teachers and intellectuals were denounced, sent to labor camps, imprisoned, and killed.  When they started up again in 1978,  they were effectively starting from nothing.<p>It's frakkin' hard to bootstrap an educational system, especially for over a billion people.  It takes educated people to produce educated people, and there just aren't enough educated teachers to go around.  The situation is slowly getting better, but it's certainly not improving fast enough to stamp out millions of high quality graduates.<p>The problem is compounded by Chinese pedagogy, which has a ""Moses down from the mountain"" flavor to it.  If your teacher gives you bad or incomplete information, then you're stuck with that.  Both critical thinking and autodidactic learning are almost entirely unknown.<p>The Chinese government should be given credit for recognizing the importance of education, but I think this time their reach has really exceeded their grasp.

9030491,comment,9025709,9027700,0,0,mabbo,,,"But on a computational power level, does that actually make them more powerful?<p>What I mean is that Finite state machines are less powerful computationally than context free grammars. A FSM cannot compute certain things that a CFG can. Further, a CFG can&#x27;t compute certain things that a Turing machine can. But we <i>do</i> know that Neural networks like the ones being used for Deep Learning can compute anything a Turing machine can, and anything a Turing machine can compute, so can the NN. They&#x27;re equivalent.<p>So the real question is this: do those features (spiking, conduction delays) actually make biological neural networks capable of computing something that Turing Machines and Artificial Neural Networks cannot?<p>I hypothesize the answer is &quot;no&quot;. A Turing machine could simulate any of those features you&#x27;ve mentioned, and therefore an ANN could also simulate them. (But I would <i>love</i> to be wrong about it, that would be amazing if human minds could do something that no machine would ever be capable of!)",1423609185

There <i>must</i> be multiple competing implementations. It <i>must</i> avoid vendor &quot;lock-in&quot;.<p>Back when virtualization was getting off the ground, there was no standardized format. Every vendor had their own format, and all were completely incompatible with one another. This made migrations incredibly painful, sometimes impossible.<p>It created a &quot;vendor lock-in&quot; <i>even when it came to the open source hypervisors</i> -- ie. once you decided on a product, you were stuck.<p>The OVF (Open Virtualization Format) came along after years of this... not without it&#x27;s imperfections -- but it was a real life saver in a great many ways. Vendors and open-source projects alike started to support the format, allowing users to export their VM&#x27;s and import them into a different hypervisor with relative ease -- no weird hacky work-arounds, no re-imaging your vm, no nonsense.<p>~~~~<p>For this kind of industry-changing technology, it&#x27;s more important to have an open standard than an open implementation.",1423608957

This is exactly why Tinder is so popular, IMO. (Almost) No one wants to waste time chatting online. And everyone (no almost here) considers beauty first and foremost when looking for a mate.  It&#x27;s just truly a shame that this is the only reputation the app has and it seems to be this way because people associate it with &quot;shallowness&quot; while they stand on a high ground doing exactly what everyone else is doing: looking at pictures and judging them on beauty. Regardless of the site (or off-site IRL), that&#x27;s what happens. Let&#x27;s face it, no one is spending time on okcupid or match deeply analyzing other profiles&#x27; text. The only people it matters to are the people creating the profile who think it actually matters (it doesn&#x27;t). I would bet money that if the text part of profiles on a traditional dating site were put a mere extra click away, while the photos stayed on the main page, the visit rate would be abysmal.<p>The genius of Tinder has been to recognize this and remove the unnecessary garbage content. Really, in dating, before you&#x27;ve met anyone, all text is garbage, including the paltry meager pleasantries exchanged on the way to actually setting up a real date in person. The actual in person date is the <i>only</i> thing that matters and Tinder has realized that and done away with the rest. If it wasn&#x27;t for the perception that it&#x27;s only about hooking up, I&#x27;d say this is really the perfect dating app.",1423608538

9030428,comment,9028607,9028876,0,0,unscaled,,,"Go isn&#x27;t (and probably will never be) a viable alternative for most of the use cases where you&#x27;d want C/C++:<p>1. Embedded, real-time, kernel: As a GC language which is not meant to write close-to-the-metal code and produces rather bloated binaries (especially compared to C), Go has no chance here. This trinity is still very much the sole territory of C where even C++ seldom dares to tread.<p>2. Truly cross-platform (not just Windows/Linux/Mac) performance-sensitive libraries that need to be callable (using bindings) from a wide range of programming languages (including C). This is a very common but often neglected class of software where C/C++ reign supreme. Libraries need lots of flexibility in terms of ABI support (e.g. support linking with different C stdlibs) and deployment (e.g. dynamic libraries, which Go, AFAIK, still doesn&#x27;t support).<p>3. Complex and lightweight GUI apps with high performance: This is the main class of application mentioned in the blog post. While there are some Go bindings to popular GUI libraries such as Qt and GTK, I&#x27;m not sure if their mature enough. Using Qt directly from C++ still seems like the path of least resistance to me. As for lightweight apps, Go apparently still has some work to do about the binary sizes.<p>4. Web Servers: This is where Go should shine! Programming a concurrent web server using Goroutines should be a breeze, and considering most web servers are still written in C, we would be relieved of the nightmare that is string manipulation in C. But right now, there&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t seem to be any Go equivalent of nginx in development. Go is probably getting mature enough, but I think that if actually squeezing every last ounce of performance is your goal, it still can&#x27;t beat nginx. For instance, nginx employs many tricks to optimize its memory allocation pattern specifically for the task it was meant to do, and I find it hard to believe that any one size fits all GC, no matter how intelligent, can get the same performance.",1423608350

A re-paint occurs when changes are made to an elements skin that changes visibility, but do not affect its layout. Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color.<p>When you use GPU-accelerated CSS properties such as opacity, translate, rotate & scale, both layout- and paint-operations are not executed. The GPU handles the changes for those properties. This is how famo.us wants to achieve its &quot;60fps&quot;.<p>React by itself can cause expensive operations too if you trigger a CSS property that is not GPU-accelerated. In the process of rendering, a DOM-element can be destroyed and recreated when your state or model changes. So be vary of third-party React-components that promise &quot;fluid&quot; or &quot;fast&quot; speeds. IMO animation is still a research-topic for React. Their manual currently lists a method for basic CSS animations and transitions, but it&#x27;s projects like React Canvas that make React a worthwhile contender for performant animations.<p><a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html</a><p>Mobile browsers are no different to Desktop browsers, almost every smartphone has a GPU of some sort.

The need for a way to try people for acts that would be considered horrific crimes elsewhere was quite pressing and universal jurisdiction was considered a way of dealing with it in a sort of vigilante style. The setting up of the International Criminal Court in 2002 alleviated much of the concern, though apparently not all of it.<p>Such questions as which crimes are sufficiently serious to warrant violation of sovereignty and what constitutes commission of them, the burden of proof required for conviction, due process rules such as whether <i>in absentia</i> trials are valid, and the like seem to get little consideration.<p>As a result, good-faith efforts like the KLWCC&#x27;s to raise awareness wind up not being very convincing and are easy to dismiss as political posturing. The KLWCC was set up by former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has long been a strident critic of US foreign policy, even going so far to suggest that the 9/11 terror attacks were staged by the US Government.

MySpace is the only social networking site with egregiously bad design that is worth speaking of, and it won't last forever.",1178524200

Chapter 1: Start a company that is innovative, morally compelling and philosophically positive; this will attract smart, motivated people that will do great things because they are smart and motivated (Enron aside)<p>Chapter 2: you are born an entrepreneur or a manager - accept who you are because you cannot change<p>Chapter 3: entrepreneurs are B students, managers are A students - unfortunately I was a B student in high school and an A student in college, something the author does not address<p>Chapter 4: strive to be good enough to survive; if you do you will be bought by a company that can make you great; but don't be great on your own or you will not survive<p>Chapter 5: have faith<p>Chapter 6: don't take no for an answer<p>Chapter 7: entrepreneurs don't have power - ""get used to it""<p>Chapter 8: stay calm and be gracious in difficult situations<p>Chapter 9: read the WSJ daily, the NY times on Sunday and pick one other reputable weekly or monthly business magazine - and don't read any other form of press<p>Chapter 10: always sell<p>Chapter 11: know what you don't know <p>Here are excerpts from Amazon reviews:<p>Review 1:<p>""This small book from the founder of Tripod is worth the hour it will take you to read it. Peabody was a `B' student and suggests that successful entrepreneurs are almost always `B' students: good at lots of things, experts at none. To compensate, `B' student entrepreneurs need to hire `A' student managers (and coders and VPs), who are excellent a one or two things, to successfully take a startup to maturity. This revelation is not rocket science, and not an entirely new concept either, but it is very interesting to hear how this strategy played out for Peabody and Tripod.<p>Even though he made millions, Peabody does not boast or make the silly claim--like many Internet millionaires--to have known all along that he was destined for greatness. In fact he is quite humble: he readily admits he was making a lot of his business strategy up as he went along, and that with Tripod, it could have just as easily gone the other way and ended in failure.<p>The three salient lessons from this very short memoir of an entrepreneur: work very hard, hire the right people, and be smart enough to know when you are getting lucky.""<p>Review 2:<p>""The advice he gives is mainly for Type-A personality entrepreneurs; Risk-taking, project-starting individuals whose main focus is getting product out the door so their effort can be called a success.<p>For anyone who does not fit that mold, this book is not necessarily speaking to you. However, even if its not directed at you, you'll still gain some insight into why people like Peabody behave and think the way they do.<p>What I liked most:<p>-- Always sell. As the person at the top of the organization, always sell.<p>-- Recognize which role is naturally in you: Entrepreneur, or Manager, and then excel in that role.<p>-- Know what you don't know. Don't try to buffalo your way through things. To me this is part of being intellectually honest.""

20127,comment,20032,20046,0,0,davidw,,,"YC is already changing a couple of variables in the funding function, so it probably makes sense to try and not modify the others, if they can help it.  Also, 20 somethings are going to be pretty happy in places like Boston or SF.  They're fun places to be at that age.<p>Once you start getting older, though, you either have a <i>lot</i> of money, or those cities are just too expensive.  And even with a lot of money, they're a rat race - a millionaire stuck in traffic is just as stuck in traffic as the minimum wage worker in the next car over.<p>So I'm happy to see someone giving that kind of model a go and wish him the best of luck.",1178522127

Sad thing is those concerned few are usually those who don't play by the rules and you end up with little might. But what the hell, someone's gotta fight.",1178521446

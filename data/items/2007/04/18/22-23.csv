I'm not a user of StumbleUpon, so correct me if I'm off base here, but I can see utilizing SU's site discovery tech for something in eBay's space, such as product or brand discovery.<p>Even if the acquisition has little to do with eBay's core business, it's easy to see that companies are always looking for expansionary development.",1176937047

14342,comment,13752,13752,0,0,davidcatalano,,,"To me the answer is simple: If you are looking to be VC or angel funded yet are just starting out then you should save the money and start an LLC. If you don't plan on VC funding then stick w/ an S Corp.<p>In 1999 we had an LLC and we converted it to a C Corp just before we acquired funding in 2000. This time around I'm a partner in an S Corp and am self-funding it. If my current situation changes, as someone already mentioned, it will be easy to change over to a C Corp.",1176936684

I would chalk Google's success up more to great execution (or buying great execution) than anything else, whether it appears their engineers need the product or not. The main places Google has failed have been sites where the network effect is crucial; they don't do so well with community sites. If Zenter's got some of that secret sauce, then, I'm guessing they'll be fine. Otherwise, :(",1176934743

14319,comment,14222,14222,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"If you're going to have a car, there are a whole bunch of independent motels on El Camino Real in Palo Alto and Mountain View.  Many of these aren't advertised on sites like Expedia, so just use Google Maps to find them, and then contact them directly for rates.  Some of 'em look kinda sketchy, but they're all safe, lots of nearby food, and probably clean enough. ;-)  Hit me up directly if you want a local's opinion on a particular Mountain View motel.  (At least how it looks from the outside.)<p>Also, you can get great deals on Priceline for excellent hotels near San Francisco Airport.  I've gotten rooms a couple times for under $40 per night for 3 or 4 star properties.  (The 3 star ones may be better because they won't gouge you on parking and Internet.)  Check out www.biddingfortravel.com to see what kind of rates people are getting.  Most airport hotels have transportation shuttles, so you can stay near the airport and take Caltrain to your interview.  But, shuttle-BART-Caltrain is a bit of a schlep.<p>Congrats and good luck!

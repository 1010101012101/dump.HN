I couldn't list them off if I wanted to right now, and generally it was some sort of epiphany that I had after thinking about a certain essay of his for a little while, but it has made me a better person.<p>Using some of the ideas and knowledge in his essays has helped me understand people better, and as I said before myself a better person. Through understanding myself better I know what to ask of others around me to accomplish greatness. It allowed me to be more confident and self-assured.<p>His ""Nerd Handbook""[1] is probably one of my favourite essays, if you haven't read it; I suggest it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/11/11/the_nerd_handbook.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/11/11/the_nerd_ha...</a>",1331679574

3700761,comment,3700249,3700249,6,0,duairc,,,"First of all, fuck patents. I'm in complete agreement about that (except for the bit where the author says that maybe they might be okay sometimes). I've long felt this way.<p>However, in the last year or two, I've become much more interested in more thorough change to the system in its entirety, for its own sake, not just because intellectual property law is stupid.<p>(Although you can use essentially capitalist economic logic to defeat the concept of intellectual property (meaning that capitalism and ""free culture"" (or whatever you want to call it) are not necessarily incompatible with each other), I don't think it will be possible (or desirable) to reform intellectual property law without also dismantling the state and (actually existing) capitalism. Or at the very least, the institution of wage labour, whereby nobody (at least by default) has access to food and shelter (the necessities of survival), because those things cost money, and people don't automatically have money, so just to be allowed to survive, they have to sell their labour. A living wage for everyone would make redundant the (invalid, anyway) argument that intellectual property rights are necessary so that creative people can earn a living, because ""a living"" won't mean ""money"" anymore.<p>(As an aside: I think intellectual property is a (failed) attempt by capitalism to deal with externalities, which it is unable to do in its unrestrained form. However, there are so many externalities, and if you were to try to fully take them all into account, you would probably end up with a fully managed economy, which seems to be the antithesis of what most capitalists want.))<p>So basically I'm coming at this from an anarchist perspective, and when I look at this stuff now I'm seeing things that I didn't see before I became an anarchist.<p>> Change is needed. However, its not going to come from our government. The lobbyists have taken over. One of the symptoms of the illness patents have caused the technology industry is the explosion of lobbyists pushing the agenda of big patent portfolio holders. They are not going to let our lawmakers give an inch.<p>It's not at all uncommon to read things like this, in fact it seems entirely uncontroversial. Governments seem to have lost all legitimacy a long time ago (did they ever have it?). People don't even seem particularly upset or angry about this, it seems just to be a fact of life.<p>> Rather than originating in Congress, its going to take a consumer uprising to cause change. What better way to create a consumer uprising than to financially cripple and possibly put out of business the largest social network on the planet ?<p>So then this is what really baffles me. ""Consumer"" and ""uprising"" in the same sentence. Why is the most imaginative form of resistance that anybody who opposes intellectual property rights can come up with always just a boycott of the relevant corporations? Ask anybody in the radical environmental movement how much personal consumer choices have helped slow climate change or transition our culture to a sustainable way of living. They've done fuck all. Why does nobody ever say that we need to organise a strike, or riot in the streets, or ever do anything more radical and direct than alter our personal consumer choices? I'm not necessarily saying that a riot is the best way to change patent law, I'm just pointing out how there seems to be this underlying idea that ""internet"" activism/politics is completely separate from ""real"" activism/politics and that the idea of connecting the two doesn't seem to occur to most people (in either world).",1331679490

3700737,comment,3700277,3700277,46,0,davemel37,,,"I think Google+ 's mistake, like the author, has to do with a changing doctrine, but i think it has more to do with a branding issue than an innovation or technology issue. (it could be both, but i would argue perception comes before reality when it comes to success)<p>I think ""Google+ is a dud,"" has less to do with whether social is broken, but rather with human perception and branding. 
Much the way Google owned the category search in peoples minds, Facebook owns the category social in peoples minds.<p>Google made two fundamental mistakes. 
1. Using their brand that stands for Search on something else. The human mind is like wet cement, once a brand owns a category, that impressions is almost impossible to change. (Ever try to change someones mind from his political philosophies? almost impossible).<p>2. Building a product in a category that is already owned by another brand without positioning themselves opposite it.<p>This is classic... Burger King will never take over Mcdonalds market share because they are trying to convince people that they are better. Since the category is owned already, they need to claim, ""We are different""<p>When it comes to branding, its all about human perception. Like the authors daughter said, ""Facebook is where the people are."" Even if that statement weren't true, the perception is ingrained in peoples minds.<p>A good example of competing with an established brand is Coke vs. Pepsi... coke was the real thing, original coca cola, so pepsi came out and said were for the new generation. Why be old when you can be young and fresh.<p>Avis didnt say we are better than hertz, they said, sine we are number 2, we try harder.<p>Dominoes didn't say we have better pizza than pizza hut, they said, we will get it to you faster.<p>Listerine didnt say we taste better than scope, they said, ""the taste you hate twice a day.""<p>This is branding 101. 
A brand can only stand for One Thing. (a brand that stands for everything, stands for nothing.)<p>If google wants to compete in the social game... They either need to create a niche of social like twitter, foursquare, and pinterest did, or they need to use a new brand name, and position themselves opposite facebook, not claim they are better...<p>Big executives always talk about convergence, but the Human perception just doesn't work that way. When you combine two things, people assume you are compromising on quality on both sides. 
When you separate things, people assume you do that one thing much better than everyone else...<p>Google owned the search brand because that was all they did, Search. The new ways of trying to get into other businesses like Paul Graham said,"" is a chink in their armor.""<p>Just my two cents.",1331678978

3700634,comment,3700489,3700489,6,0,jacobr,,,"Yesterday me and my girlfriend were looking for a car related service, and we found a site which supplied that service. It was obvious that it was using some kind of generic design template, so both of us got a bit suspicious, and not until we had researched the company for quite a while were we OK with doing business with them. It just didn't feel serious.<p>I feel the same way with a Bootstrap site that isn't customized at all - I would hesitate doing business with them, because if you don't have the resources to put a day on at least _customizing_ your design, are you really trustworthy? Of course you can be, and it's not a completely rational feeling, but I would be surprised if I am the only one with that gut reaction.<p>For minor tools (such as <a href=""http://dochub.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dochub.io</a>) and other small projects, Twitter Bootstrap is awesome and doesn't even need much customization, but I don't think it's a good idea to use it uncustomized for a business.",1331676820

If you can't exercise control over the people that use your trademark, it's useless.<p>* Patent litigation is too expensive for small firms and too cheap for large ones; figuring out how to fix this would be a big win.  That can be done by adjusting the actual cost, the outcome probability, or the judgement amount.  Time until judgement is also a big factor.<p>* This system doesn't address the problem of submarine patents, that are kept hidden for years until a lot of firms are unknowingly infringing, and then get sued for large damages.  It needs to address how a company knows whether or not it needs to license a patent for its technology.  Perhaps holding a patent on a technology should give you ""clear to operate"" approval, and existing patent holders must review and challenge patent applications before they're granted.",1331676745

3700606,comment,3698657,3698657,1,0,vibrunazo,,,"1) Why is manipulating people inherently bad? The author simply throws:<p>> ""The downside to this model is it that the companys and users interests can never be aligned because the user is not the one paying for the product.""<p>But he doesn't expand on it. To get users you still need a good product even if it's free or users would use something else. Part of the lessons behind increasing click through rates is to build a desirable user experience. The users are not wiring you money directly, but they're still worth money indirectly. Just saying ""every free product must be bad for the consumer"" sounds like a simplistic over-generalization.<p>2) How is every business not manipulating people instead of just machines? There isn't a black or white here. You don't manipulate machines simply out of love to build a genius technological innovation. You do it to manipulate people. Each piece of hardware or line of code is put in place trying to solve the same questions the author poses for manipulating people. Which GPU I need for users to buy games? Which algorithm gives better recommendations that the user will actually click on? Businesses manipulate machines while manipulating people. Only hobbyists do otherwise.<p>3) Is he using Apple as an example of a company who favors manipulating machines over people? Apple are the most extreme example of the contrary. They're genius at manipulating people. Many here will point out their technology are just small evolution over what existed before. But it's their genius marketing, branding and expert people manipulation skills that convince users their products are status symbols worth of their loyalty. And there's nothing wrong with these. Every business wish they had the people expertise that Apple does. That's what make businesses work. It's genius people skills that brings genius machine skills into user's hands.",1331676273

Importantly, when you have &quot;a + a,&quot; taking a value from the left &quot;a&quot; is distinct from taking a value from the right &quot;a.&quot;<p>>So then why is the Bool type 1 + 1 == 2? Shouldn&#x27;t it be 1 + 0 == 1 if you want to map the possible states?<p>&quot;0,&quot; &quot;1,&quot; and &quot;2&quot; here do not denote states; rather, they denote types. In particular, &quot;0&quot; is the type with zero values, &quot;1&quot; is the type with one value, &quot;2&quot; is the type with two values, etc.<p>The reason that &quot;1 + 1 = 2&quot; is true is that there are two ways to form a value of type &quot;1 + 1:&quot; take the one possible value from the left &quot;1,&quot; or take the one possible value from the right &quot;1.&quot; The Bool type, by definition, has two values, so it needs to be given by the type &quot;2,&quot; or equivalently, &quot;1 + 1.&quot;<p>>Same question for &quot;maybe&quot; that seems to work like in Rust or Swift - shouldn&#x27;t it be a + 0? If not, what does &quot;a or unit&quot; mean?<p>&quot;a + 0&quot; is, as the algebra suggest, just &quot;a.&quot; This is because the only way to form a value of type &quot;a + 0&quot; is to use a value from &quot;a;&quot; there are no values in &quot;0&quot; to choose from. The Maybe type is effectively the identity type plus a single &quot;None&quot; value. Thus, we call it &quot;a + 1;&quot; there is a &quot;Some&quot; for each value in &quot;a,&quot; and a None for each (i.e., the only) value in &quot;1.&quot;",1435222489

(And that money would go back to the citizens giving them more money to buy stuff, so effectively you did nothing at all. It would only work if there were low CO2 alternatives, but there are not any. All the renewable energy sources have decade long payouts, so at least initially emit lots of CO2, which you would have to pay tax on, so the tax makes renewable energy more expensive too.)<p>Because ultimately everything requires energy to make cost is an excellent proxy for energy, and in a world where most energy is from hydrocarbons, cost is a proxy for CO2.",1435219789

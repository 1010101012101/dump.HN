60383,comment,59794,60037,0,0,stuki,,,"	Check out Gemstone/S. A distributed, persistent and transactional Smalltalk image. It's flat out cool. As far as I know, they have even ported Seaside to run on top of it, which would make it the ne plus ultra for rich object model web app development.
 
	Just like every other odb or network db, the problems only surface when you need to query along paths you didn't design for up front (i.e. when you can no longer chase pointers). That's where rdbms' really shine. And when people not intimately familiar with your apps' object model need some of its data. Expecting some 'analyst' somewhere, to fire up a Smalltalk image, in order to create a report making his boss look good, is probably a bit much.

You might start with something good in isolation, but being subjected to many differing viewpoints and perspectives will challenge your idea, and force you to flesh it out in ways you may never have done on your own.<p>In keeping with the evolution analogy, this type of force causes your original concept to mutate into something which is (often) superior.<p>",1190933676

Advertisements are <i>one</i> component of marketing, and without them, all the other--more dishonest--components have all the more power. Most prominently, advertising allows the smallest companies to compete for attention along with massive companies, if only in a targeted way.<p><i>identifying ads is relatively easy technically</i><p>Oh, you think so? Well, when adblockers become standard issue, I can assure you that advertisements will be very difficult to identify, because they will be incorporated into search results, as in the old days.",1190933421

60374,comment,60109,60367,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The addiction wasn't so much mine as my clients.  I had to wean them...and with enough time for them to hire someone to take my place.  In the case of my biggest customer, they hired a full-time employee for the role.<p>I think the impetus I needed was the right business.  I'd been working on Virtualmin for fun for two years...somehow it never occurred to me to make it a business for most of that time.  When it finally did, it all seemed inevitable: it really felt like, from day one, that as long as I worked hard, it could not possibly fail (and that initial gut feeling is turning out to be right a couple of years later).<p>Some things I did to make it clear to myself that I was done with that old business:<p>1. Gave up my downtown Austin office.  (Corner of 6th and Congress, Bank of America building...best location in the whole city.)<p>2. Took down the old business website.  I left up all of the support materials and such (and it still gets thousands of hits per day), but I removed all contact information.<p>3. Gave myself deadlines for launching the new business.  ""The website will be launched on X, and we'll be selling products by Y.""<p>4. Did Y Combinator.  Not everybody gets to do that, but it triggered a number of changes that made the break between the old life and the new one very dramatic and difficult to go back on: I sold my 350Z and had a huge garage sale to get rid of a lot of my stuff, moved to the Valley (the getting rid of stuff is enforced when moving to the Valley--I couldn't afford as much space out here as in Austin), and didn't keep my old phone numbers.<p>The last one has probably been the most effective.  I was still occasionally taking jobs when friends asked when I still lived in Austin.  The thought process is, ""Hey, what can a couple of days hurt?  It'll give the new company more runway.""  But it slows you down, and gives you a safety net.  Once I didn't have the safety net, I started thinking a lot faster and lot harder about how to increase revenues to a livable amount (I've never had a lot of big expenses, even the Z, so I had enough savings to last quite a while, but moving to the Valley dips into that pretty quickly).<p>NOTE: I don't have a family to feed and house.  My co-founder kept his full-time job throughout all of this, because he has a family.  I'm not saying the dramatic ""drop everything and get serious"" is the right path for everyone.",1190931554

If you're using Google Analytics then Google knows who goes to your site, when they use it, where the go when they leave, etc. It's a great way to pick your next acquisition. Anyone have any thoughts on this? Zenter perhaps?",1190930468

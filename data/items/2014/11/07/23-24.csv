Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Colorado, and D.C. now have full legalization in legislation. Florida got nearly 58% on medical marijuana vote that unfortunately needed 60%. 23 states have legalized medical marijuana. (Up to date map: <a href=""https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/marijuana-ma.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/marijuana-ma...</a>. )\nMore importantly, criminalization is moving towards citations across the nation. We are getting rid of draconian mandatory sentencing for drug crimes. This is all very good news, and while it&#x27;s slow, remember that the government moves slow, but as long as it keeps moving in the right direction, we can look forward to a time in which full legalization of all scheduled drugs may eventually become a reality.\nSo instead of being defeatist or spouting sarcasm, step up and support the people making this happen. It&#x27;s not just public opinion changing, it&#x27;s SSDP, MPP, NORML putting money, time, and effort into lobbying for these changes.

It is definitely true that the former is helpful for the latter, but not everyone is using parallelism/concurrency for IO tasks.<p>In any case, Rust 1.0 is not aiming to be feature complete in language or library, it is just the point of guaranteed backwards compatibility and additions and improvements will continue.

The former is exactly what Rust will have, it has highly efficient FFI (a Rust -> C function call is the same as C -> C function call) and so can bind to the high-performance libraries other have written without any overhead. However, there&#x27;s no reason that people can&#x27;t build a nice and high-level API above the direct bindings though (this is exactly what happens, e.g. the game-development community has quite a few nice-to-use libraries[1] that are thin layers above the low-level C functionality).<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/carllerche/mio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/carllerche/mio</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Computer-Graphics-and-Game-Development"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Computer-Graphics-and...</a>",1415404506

So how did the first megacorps get started in the first place?<p>Japan&#x27;s main modern megacorps largely are the same entities that were major business from the time of the Meiji Restoration (and some were <i>founded</i> much earlier, and are older than the US), or remixes of those entities that occurred when some of the old <i>zaibatsu</i> were broken up after WWII. They were formed as megacorps, for the most part, through very intense relations between government (both national and clan governments) and business industries, with a major component of that formation being either new or existing private enterprises whose founders had government connections taking over (often, at least initially, by leasing) the facilities of government business enterprises.<p>Those megacorps clearly aren&#x27;t an indication of entrepreneurship in <i>modern</i> Japan.

8575206,comment,8572600,8572600,0,0,brianshaler,,,"Is the author&#x27;s use of the term `module` specific to erlang? To me, it sounds like he&#x27;s advocating for modules that are comprised of a single function, rather than utility belt modules that contain many functions. As I understand it, I agree with what the author proposes, and I feel like a subset of npm already provides what he&#x27;s talking about. The best example is probably underscore.js versus lodash.js, which both have many functions and a wide API surface area. What&#x27;s notable is that you can cherry-pick individual lodash functions and depend on a specific version[0]. (Admittedly, I lazily pull in the full lodash module instead of importing only the function(s) I&#x27;m using)<p>Lately, I&#x27;ve been moving more toward the proposed design in my Node.js projects. It keeps individual files concise, makes code sharing trivial, encourages stateless methods, and it makes writing tests a breeze.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/lodash-modularized"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/lodash-modularized</a>",1415402717

A movie which satirizes this aspect of Japanese culture is オムライス　(&quot;Omuraisu&quot; -- Omelette Rice: 2011 I think). In this film, the main character walks around his town (one of the purposes of his walk being to obtain ingredients for omelette rice), and responds to various odd signage. He invents stories which explain how those signs might have come to be, and those stories come alive as a sequence of disconnected, or loosely connected vignettes by various comedians.<p>One of the vignettes revolves around a succinct sign explaining a shop&#x27;s opening hours on various days. The protagonist imagines that the sign began as a slightly different sign: one with a missing dash (though this is not easy for viewers to notice, I think). In the vignette, the characters argue about how the sign is unclear and propose various changes to it which make it more and more verbose. Finally, a third guy comes along and just adds the missing dash to the original (producing the succinct sign as seen by the protagonist). Everyone is like, &quot;whoa ...&quot;.<p>Japanese sites don&#x27;t rate this film very highly, but I liked it. It&#x27;s not bad for &quot;foreigners&quot; interested in Japan.

Google has some benevolence (advice about how to eat healthy, paid gym memberships, etc.), but it&#x27;s not quite like the Japanese companies he describes.  Nobody is managing your rent, or setting you up with dates.  (Too bad, I hate dealing with landlords.)  You can quit, do a startup, and come back.  People that can&#x27;t program don&#x27;t end up doing planning meetings and making spreadsheets.<p>Certainly, if you like your job, your responsibilities will probably expand to take more than the 40 hour workweek.

Add in the fact that most consumer TN panels are actually 6-bits per component with temporal dithering (rapidly flickering between two colors, basically) to compensate, and it&#x27;s even worse. A lot of AV enthusiasts have switched to 10-bit (1024 possible values) per channel encodings for this reason: it preserves subtle gradients which improves compression and allows them to be displayed with dithering on lesser displays.<p>>2. Many artists will use opposite colors on the color wheel to darken colors- So to make a darker yellow, they&#x27;ll mix in purple paint (or use purple dithering, depending on the medium.) How this relates to color theory from a psychological standpoint is unclear<p>It&#x27;s just a simple way to desaturate the darker tones. If saturation is the degree that a color&#x27;s strongest components deviate from its weakest, then it follows that adding a bit of the opposite mix of components to a color will even the components out and thus reduce saturation. If you tried to do the same by mixing black or grey into it, you&#x27;d go beyond evening the components and also reduce what were the dominant ones, and get a much duller color than you probably intended. Beginning artists often do this with skin tones, where it looks dull and lifeless to the point of being disturbing.<p>>6. A good rule for UI design is to only use two colors at most (besides gray tones) on the screen at a single time and maybe one extra color in a very limited way. If you don&#x27;t do this, you&#x27;ll end with an &quot;angry fruit salad&quot; interface<p>Heh, I&#x27;ll have to remember that one. Pretty much sums up how I feel about syntax highlighting.",1415401684

If you don&#x27;t need to provide identification, then this might be an interesting avenue to explore.  Thank you for fact checking me.<p>There&#x27;s the chance that datacenters will be more inclined to image your server for authorities if you&#x27;ve set up a server using bitcoin and are hosting large amounts of Tor traffic, but at this point we must assume authorities will image your server anyway, so there&#x27;s no reason not to go this route if it&#x27;s as good as you say.<p>You may need anonymous money for other things, but server rental was the primary case I had in mind.",1415401660

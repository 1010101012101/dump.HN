It&#x27;s not because they&#x27;ve got some ideal that they&#x27;re trying to fit into that says &quot;real rockstars don&#x27;t ask for help&quot; because that&#x27;s totally maladaptive.

However, they equipment doesn&#x27;t belong to them. They are only visitors to someone else&#x27;s private property. Even if they had the source to the modifications, they would not be able to make further modifications and put them into effect on your server, since they don&#x27;t have administrative access.<p>There is no run around the GPL; the GPL is simply not applicable. It can&#x27;t give people the right to tinker with your private property.<p>Never mind not having the GPL-granted rights: if the users are getting a free service, they don&#x27;t even have any right to expect that it will continue. Tomorrow you might pull the plug on the server (perhaps forced to, due to economics) and that&#x27;s that.<p>The issue here isn&#x27;t whether or not there is a GPL violation. There clearly isn&#x27;t; the GPL simply isn&#x27;t applicable.<p>The issue here is that gullible users make uninformed choices such that they throw away freedoms. The &quot;takes away your freedom&quot; rhetoric therefore rings untrue. That&#x27;s like saying a contract that you irresponsibly signed without reading it has &quot;taken&quot; your freedom away. Where is the personal accountability?<p>The only genuine freedom-related problem is that widespread use of anything creates pressure on people to become users, simply in order to interoperate with the majority.

No-one is a true scotsman I suppose :)<p>As I stated the main value proposition of LinkedIn for me is that most of my connections are there.<p>Replacing the said connections would require work and time, which I would rather spend on other things. The problem with an email list is that there is no automatic update if the email address changes. Therefore, changing to a email list would lead to a poorer result for me.<p>I prefer introversion to extroversion. Going out to meetings would therefore be a) mentally exhausting b) take time. The former is doable but the latter is really hard to come by with a 9-5 job and kids.<p>Now, as to the proposition of spending my energies trying to invent an open competitor to LinkedIn... Building communities takes a huge effort and seems to happen mostly by chance. Also, while being a technology professional my core skillset is in CAD and maths and I&#x27;m clueless when it comes to web technologies.<p>So, in order to do a fancy LinkedIn replacement would require a) time to improve on my web skills, which is really wasteful considering lots of people are good at it already, b) create the product c) move all my dear colleagues to the new network.<p>The last parts are actually the hardest, I have no idea how to build social sites or how to motivate people.<p>So, to rephrase why I use LinkedIn: It currently provides me value, and I do not see sufficient benefit to spend time changing mine <i>and my colleagues habits</i> when it comes to networking. Most things in life are morally ambiguous and all one can do is to try to do more good than harm <i>within ones limits</i>. Sometimes all an individual can do is go with the flow.<p>People have different internal motivations. Mine run completely against social things. I prefer to twiddle on algorithms, draw, play the guitar and play with my kids. I use the social frameworks that exist because I see the value they provide but have no energy to change them nor am I motivated to design alternatives to them.<p>Yeah, middle age, definetly :)<p>Most peoples are not motivated by ambiguous &quot;this is evil because...&quot; arguments. Most behavioural changes are best driven by positive motivators - one cannot drive people away from anything by saying &quot;the thing is evil&quot;. Eating meat is evil and still people do it, including me. What needs to be done is to provide better alternatives that wean people away from option a) (the evil) to option b) over time.",1423903478

9049109,comment,9045305,9047620,0,0,itsjareds,,,"I&#x27;ve never been to your subreddit before, but now I think I&#x27;ve found a blog I&#x27;ll be keeping/catching up with for the next few weeks.<p>I agree with you in general. A while ago I tried thinking of some other paradigm to keep track of webpages I might want to get back to in the near future without the permanence of bookmarks. Some of my thoughts:<p>Web browsers are used for multiple activities that have their own &quot;stack&quot; in my mind. Often I find myself opening a whole set of tabs that are all related to a general activity I am doing. For example, I&#x27;m be doing some coursework and open a million tabs (man pages, tutorials, etc.), then I close my laptop and go to bed. The next day it&#x27;s class time and I just want a clean tab pane to focus only on what is being discussed in class. Then maybe the next day it&#x27;s the weekend and I&#x27;m relaxing, reading some blogs, going on social media, etc. The point is that every time I use my browser, I might not be performing the same overall activity, and I don&#x27;t want to be distracted by what I did hours ago.<p>I don&#x27;t want to lose information on what I was doing earlier, though. I want to be able to come back to the particular state of my browser as it was when I was last doing a certain activity. Let&#x27;s say I have Tuesday/Thursday classes, and on Thursday I want to return to where I left off on Tuesday. I need a way to get back to that state without what I may have done on the browser between then and now to get in the way.<p>Bookmarks don&#x27;t cut it for me in this regard. Bookmarks only work for a <i>single</i> webpage. But maybe I have a whole group of webpages that are all inter-related! Using the bookmark model we have now, I&#x27;ll have to bookmark each page individually, then open them up individually when I want to return. There are add-ons that bookmark tab sets, but I think that UI needs to be a core part of browser UI, not wedged into a browser extension.<p>Right now, I think the most useful way to manage tabs (for me, YMMV) is some combination of tab pinning, tab groups and tree style tabs, and tab suspension/delayed loading. Each of those has a particular advantage:<p>Tab pinning (as seen in Firefox and Chrome) is useful to me. It lets me identify single tab activities (usually web apps) that I <i>always</i> want to have available to me because they are commonly accessed. Facebook, email, Youtube, Calendar, etc. It is useful to have a muscle-memory location on my tab pane that I can quickly switch back to those common activities.<p>Tab groups are one of my top favorite features in Firefox. It so naturally fits my particular workflow where I might be switching browsing contexts on a daily basis (class, work, relaxing, Wikipedia bingeing, blog reading, ...). The main brilliance behind tab groups is that they act as a less permanent form of a bookmark group. I can easily switch between contexts in a context overview mode (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E), and all of my contexts are clearly delineated. All I have to do to organize the contexts is to think &quot;I am starting a new activity&quot; and open a new tab group. However, I only need to close a tab for it to be gone from my mind.<p>Tree Style Tabs does this pretty well too, but for some reason I just found the UI unintuitive. Plenty of other people like it so I won&#x27;t knock it. It does do a good job of organizing tabs by activity.<p>Another style that I thought was interesting is tab stacking as seen in Opera[1]. I think it is an idea not mutually exclusive to tab groups.<p>I also really like Firefox&#x27;s delayed loading of tabs on startup. It fits perfectly with the concept of tab groups because it automatically means that other tab groups won&#x27;t load up, and little memory and CPU cycles are wasted on them. Right now I have 81 tabs &quot;open&quot; in various tab groups, but Firefox has only loaded the ones I clicked or opened since starting.<p>Where things can improve:<p>1. Memory management/unloading of old tabs<p>I really think if Firefox wants to embrace the idea of tab groups, it needs to clear out tabs that haven&#x27;t been interacted with for a long time. That would bring the best of all worlds: only the tabs I care about being open are open, and the tabs (and tab groups) I care about (with associated states, tab histories, and page scroll placement) are still preserved. Some add-ons like Bartab[2] are a good step in this direction, but it would be nice to see this put into mainline Firefox (with a preference to adjust the time limit to, say, infinity).<p>2. Tab group classification or tagging<p>Tab pins also could be more useful if they had some way to classify them based on importance. Currently, if you pin a tab in Firefox, the pin is available within <i>all</i> tab groups. However, I think the idea can be expanded so that you can:<p>* Pin for all tab groups<p>* Pin for a certain subset of tab groups (e.g. YouTube pin only on groups categorized/tagged with &quot;relax&quot;)<p>* Pin for a single tab group<p>3. Tab stacking<p>As I said earlier, tab stacking is available in Opera, but I&#x27;d like to see it in other browsers too. It&#x27;s another way to save on tab bar space while also grouping tabs by concept. One could use tab stacking <i>and</i> tab groups <i>and</i> pinning at the same time.<p>I think this idea would particularly match the use case of having a web application like a Google Doc open while also doing some research: create a new tab group, pin the document tab to just a single tab group (so that it is permanent and also takes up less horizontal space), and then go about browsing as normal with the rest of your tab space. Similar tabs (e.g. tabs on the same domain) can be stacked, and switching tab stacks automatically maximizes one stack while minimizing the others.<p>4. Open the browser to the tab overview page<p>This one is pretty self-explanatory. I think opening into a tab group overview is a better way to deal with the concept that a browser is used for multiple activities, and it may not be the same (or last) activity on startup every time.<p>These are just wishful ideas that I have. Firefox does the best job for me right now, I can&#x27;t even use Chrome for my workflow because it just doesn&#x27;t handle >50 tabs well enough.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.operasoftware.com/press/releases/desktop/tabs-go-to-11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.operasoftware.com/press/releases/desktop/tabs-go-...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bartab/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bartab/</a>",1423901959

Homosexuality was technically illegal, but not prosecuted, and in fact, the  Weimar Republic was known for its tolerance.<p>When the Nazis came to power, they used those previously obtained lists to round up the homosexuals and send them to death camps.  A lesson that privacy matters even if you think your current government and/or its use of data is benign.<p><a href=""http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005261"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005261</a>",1423901449

From the comments, it seems the only reason to support navigating to 0.0.0.0 is because some people got used to using that and they&#x27;re getting confused or don&#x27;t want to change their habits. This is the kind of accumulating crud that makes web browsers the ugly monsters they are, but it&#x27;s not even of the important type like supporting non-standards-compliant websites. Imagine how the world would be a slightly better place if the Chrome guys asked Firefox etc to stop supporting 0.0.0.0 too, then people will stop blaming the browser and change their behavior.",1423900885

Autonomous cars will further the trend. Cars are going to become a B2B product, not exactly Apple&#x27;s playground. But this is in the long run so it could not matter even strategically.<p>About winning the smartphone war, if Apple won it, that was the war for cash. Android won the war for usage, same way IE won the browser wars. I wonder what&#x27;s the margin on a car. If you have to make low margin products to keep selling high margin ones you end up low margin overall. So, if Apple goes for $50+k cars, it will still be a high margin business but even more biased towards the richest consumers. If it goes for 10k cars, that will be a big change in strategy.",1423900813

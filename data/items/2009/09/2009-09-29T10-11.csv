850113,comment,849697,850049,0,0,jrockway,,,"Even without frequent flyer programs, airlines still control markets.  Most people prefer non-stop to connecting flights, and not every airline flies between every possible city pair.  So people are locked in to the carrier that happens to fly to the destination of their choice.  Taking a connecting flight to save money might be as inconvenient as switching phone companies to save money.",1254220963

Not exactly a neutral comparison and hypocracy in light of his complaints against the strong vs. weak labels.<p>Isn't it fair to say statically typed languages are still faster but are generally heavier and less agile. So surely the inverse is a much better analogy. Or is it that dynamic are more modern? In which case may I propose: statically typed languages are automobiles and dynamically typed languages are segways! (I kid).",1254220711

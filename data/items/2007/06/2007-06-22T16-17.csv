Making a million pounds in a lifetime is a reasonable possibility, but in our increasingly technological world, not EVER being able to own a phone would be a HUGE hindrance to success.  20 years from now, that may be about the only way to communicate with people.",1182530802

He could potentially sell targeted travel related advertising, but CTR on travel ads are woefully low unless you are really close to the deal (i.e. someone is searching for ""tickets from Seattle to London"").  99% of travel traffic are people who window shopping.<p>And, of course, if places like iLike REALLY take off, why wouldn't Facebook behave like Microsoft and just build the functionality into the platform?

30063,comment,29821,29821,0,0,webwright,,,"Sure would.  I'd start on a contracting basis (more ""at-will"", less paperwork)...<p>The challenge is actually understanding whether a telecommuting college student was really digging in, putting in the hours, and generating high-quality code.  And, of course, there's the challenge of a distributed team (but that's a pretty well-understood challenge).<p>If you have a passion for productivity/GTD and that sorta thing, feel free to drop me a line.  If you have passion for other things, it might be worth posting a link to a bit more information about you and what you enjoy.  The only thing cooler than writing great software is writing great software that solves a problem that you care about.",1182530024

And from what I've read, Google is still mostly C++ and Java, with Python a distant third: smart humans (think Norvig) have an easier time thinking in Python, but computers (see Norvig: <a href=""http://norvig.com/python-lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/python-lisp.html</a> ) aren't so lucky.",1182529761

30060,comment,29778,29853,0,0,iloveyouocean,,,"But there are two categories of ideas:  features to release to users, and decisions about how to write/structure code.  Of course users are the best people to bounce features off of (although an initial 'partner filter' is often valuable), but they most likely have nothing to say about actually writing code, or for that matter almost any other business decision.",1182529245

30058,comment,30035,30047,0,0,teacherjames,,,"Hi, I took a look at their website. While they are tapping into the East Asian market with mentors from UK and US, they do not specifically target ""Teaching English"". Instead they aim for lots of different types of mentoring. Also, you have to enroll as a mentor, and on the student side parents pay for the mentorship (I'm thinking similar to a tuition). <p>Our site is immediate registration, searchable teacher database, and no long term commitments or tuitions. You negotiate each lesson directly with your teacher. <p>I would not consider batiq.com as a competitor, but more as a company with similar ideals. ",1182528864

30056,comment,29923,29994,0,0,iloveyouocean,,,"Add a layer of interaction to the process.  The default behavior would be to leave the text in images untranslated, but when viewing the translated page there would be an easy way to select specific images for translation.  There would also be a ""translate all images"" option.
 
Perhaps an even better product to create would be an interactive translation overlay that semi-intelligently created ""areas"" on a page (such as body text, images, menus, etc).  You could simply click on the area you desired to have translated.  The app would take note of which areas you clicked on and if you browsed to another page on the same site would automatically translate the corresponding area on the next page. ",1182528625

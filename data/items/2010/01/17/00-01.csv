This makes your site inherently less viral (although I hate to use the term) than, say, facebook.<p>Off the top of my head, I can't think of a solution to this problem, but maybe some relentless resourcefulness on your part can do the trick :-)",1263689835

Both were at extreme pains to make sure their <i>free</i> software was free of security problems. Unlike <i>any</i> commercial software, security software included, software security was the #1 priority for both these projects.<p>Both failed to ship code free of game-over security flaws.<p>I find your point about ""tolerating"" failure to be irrelevant to the real world at best. At worst, it's just fatuous.<p>I've shipped hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and I've led projects to review millions of lines more: chipset to JVM, embedded to desktop, open source and proprietary. It is a point of pride with us: <i>we always find things</i>.<p>You think you're being respectful of users when you chant ""don't tolerate failure"". What you're really doing is being disrespectful of computer science. All evidence available to us suggests that it is practically impossible to ship code --- or at least, real-world code --- without security flaws.<p>Is secure software an impossible goal? Not for computer scientists. For instance, a Stanford team build a system for evaluating code for flaws based on abstract analysis. That project became Coverity, a commercial product for scanning source code for flaws. They compete with a larger company called Fortify, in a hundred million dollar market for static code analysis.<p>Projects like Stanford Checker, or the OS and runtime hardening work being done in countless labs, have a chance of advancing the state of the art to where you think it really is now.

Flash can't use hardware acceleration until Apple adds support for it to their video drivers. Sure, it took adobe a long time to get to this point, but video online is still young compared to the lifetime of the Flash Plugin, so your argument that the plugin has been around ""for years"" also doesn't make much sense.<p>I also don't agree with your second point, considering the things you are complaining about ""games, sites, ads"" are generally created with Flash because the advertiser (or ad agency) wants to do something that HTML can't do. It's their choice to do it, so don't blame their poor choices (and often poor coding) on the technology.<p>Consider that in general games and rich interactive things take more CPU than static HTML and graphics, so of course it will take more CPU to render those things.

So I tricked out mutt with complete configs for my IMAP accounts and RTFM. I must say, I'm impressed and feel like I made a huge leap forward.

The author doesn't list a single problem with current email clients, except maybe that he hints at wanting one with keyboard accessibility rather than requiring a mouse.  Either he has no idea what's available (in which case, he should search first), or he hasn't really thought about what he wants in an email client.<p>Regarding what he considers obvious:\n- Cocoa? I have no idea why Cocoa would be obvious.  Surely an email client for developers would need to run on at least Windows, Linux and Mac OSX since there are enough developers that use each of these.\n- IMAP only?  Good idea, but that's really the easiest part of the problem.  I'd say defer this to fetchmail to start with and just read from a local directory.  Add actual IMAP support once you've figured out the UI.  That's the real hard part.\n- twitter account?  yeah.  'nuff said.<p>The biggest problem with email today is not that a client doesn't exist to satisfy your needs.  Every developer I've met does in fact have at least one email client that satisfies all their requirements.  For some it's thunderbird, for others it's gnus or mutt or pine, others like gmail, still others like Mail.app, and believe it or not, there are actually developers who like MS Outlook or Entourage.  No, the biggest problem with email is that trust isn't yet built into it.  PGP/GPG/DKIM/Authenticated SMTP, and others exist, but the majority of email users have no idea what these are or how to use them, and unless every email user in the world switches to using some kind of trusted authentication system, email will stay the way it is today.",1263688080

LINQ in C# and VB is a great example - while it looks like they've baked in language support for lots of concepts (querying databases and XML, for data parallelism and for event-driven programming), what they've really done is recognised that those are all forms of monadic computation, baked in language support for <i>one</i> thing (monadic expressions), then implemented those concepts as <i>libraries</i> that any user could have written.  (Erik Meijer and Brian Beckman on MS's Channel 9 explain this really nicely.)",1263687392

Search got awesome in the new version. Calendar is supported with Lightning, and works well with Google Calendar. Multiple languages and encodings? Also just works.<p>So what if it can also be used by non-technical people? If you want something with more geek cred, set up emacs to do your email. Otherwise just write an extension to Thunderbird that implements whatever functionality it's currently missing. There is no need for more fragmentation.",1263687215

This is going to be the first of a (hopefully) annual occurrence.  A great event to pull customers and businesses together, yadda yadda.  Nobody wants to be the first vendor to sign up for his show.  So, he starts calling some 2nd tier companies and telling them there is ""limited space"" and ""many of their competitors are already on-board"", but of course he can't name specific names.<p>Once people started thinking it was actually filling up and was going to be a good event they started to sign up.  He managed to fill the whole expo space at the last minute and everyone lived happily ever after.<p>Had he not sold on the ""lie"" it would of never happened...

At which point you&#x27;re dealing with a lot more headaches.<p>The author illustrates something I think many of us too often forget: ease of use is often determined not by the intended use of the tooling, but by how easily they can be put to unintended uses - which in turn depends heavily on the ability of user to try stuff and observe what happens as a result.<p>I see more and more people - not programmers - poking around with JavaScript in their favorite web apps for the same reasons: low barrier to entry, low cost to failure, immediate gratification when they hit upon something that works.",1419919198

8813523,story,,,1,0,jonmrodriguez,"Factory equipment investing as an alternative to real-estate investing? [ask HN]",,"I understand that many people find real-estate investing appealing for several reasons, including the fact that real-estate appreciates in value, generates a recurring income stream, and has preferential tax treatment.<p>I see the appeal, but I feel that (like stock market investing), real-estate investing is ethically neutral.  If possible, it would be nice to be able to have the money accomplish something socially beneficial, something more than just making a return.<p>I was thinking, what if instead of real-estate investing, what if tech people like us were to invest in factory equipment?  E.g. pick & place machines, reflow soldering machines, 3D printers, CNCs, DNA synthesis machines, etc.  Just like buying a house and renting it out to tenants, one could buy a (probably used) machine that is on the market at a favorable price, mod / upgrade it to increase its value, and then rent it out to anyone who wants to start or expand a factory but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of capital.<p>If a lot of us do this, it could make it easier for people in the west to start and expand factories, and ultimately expand the domestic manufacturing industry / maker movement.<p>It seems like main difference would be that equipment (unlike real-estate) would naturally tend to decrease in value over time, but I propose that this could be counteracted by (1) avoiding equipment that is extremely quickly obsoleted such as bitcoin-mining rigs and (2) by keeping the equipment in good repair and upgrading it over time with aftermarket modifications.<p>Any thoughts on whether this approach would be feasible as a way to turn small-scale investment income into monthly recurring revenue?<p>Cheers and happy holidays!",1419919023

Driving on a road also blocks other cars from driving on it at the same time.<p>The objection is not really that the road is being blocked, but that some group of people care more about their protest than they do about other people&#x27;s convenience, and that just cannot stand. People should be only allowed to protest if people who wouldn&#x27;t protest aren&#x27;t bothered by it.<p>I don&#x27;t think this has anything to do with the difference between blocking or using, or &#x27;intended use&#x27; -- whatever that philosophical quandary is supposed to mean. This is about efficiency and cost. At what cost should a protest be illegal? &quot;At the inconvenience of a small public&quot; is what I&#x27;m hearing.<p>Addendum: &quot;Intended use&quot; is not a data point. It is not something that an intelligent person can use to make decisions. &quot;Actual use&quot;, yes. Things in really are actually used. They are never &quot;intendedly used,&quot; and talking about it as such is a moratorium on creativity. Those protesters certainly intended to use the road as a platform for protesting. Are they not voting citizens of their country who also helped pay for those roads? Intent is the least important thing in the world.",1419918778

For instance, the American revolution was instigated and conducted by a few discontented landholders, without seeking permission or widespread acceptance from the broader population.  If the means for widespread democratic input had existed in the years leading up to 1776, would Washington have been able to mobilize successfully?  Or would the mainstream media have been co-opted by the British to proclaim him a &quot;radical dissident&quot; or a &quot;terrorist,&quot; hopelessly marginalizing the revolutionaries?<p>That&#x27;s the problem that any would-be Chinese or Russian revolutionary faces.

For example, most programming languages have a  standard library (the cathedral) and an ecosystem of third party libraries (the bazaar). Within that ecosystem of third party libraries, we could theoretically have curated repositories of libraries which share a coherent vision. In the real world though, I haven&#x27;t really seen that happening. Node.js has registry.npmjs.org (no curation), Ruby has rubygems.org (no curation), etc. In the OS world, there is Ubuntu which is more cathedral like but I feel it should be a lot more opinionated perhaps at the cost of flexibility/portability.",1419918198

Another option would be to collaborate with other airlines to suspend return tickets, but I suppose that would be collusion and wouldn&#x27;t fly with regulators. You could also try a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma-y thing where future sales to a customer that has hidden city-routed in the past are marked up to fix the difference. If all airlines did this then only infrequent flyers would be able to hidden-city route.

8813426,comment,8812724,8812724,0,0,Animats,,,"The article author points out several problems in the open source world.<p>The first is that it&#x27;s too hard to converge things that have diverged. I pointed out an example in a Python library recently - the code for parsing ISO standard date/time stamps exists in at least 11 different versions, most of them with known, but different, bugs. I&#x27;ve had an issue open for two years to get a single usable version into the standard Python library.<p>Some of this is a tooling problem.  Few source control systems allow sharing a file between different projects.  (Microsoft SourceSafe is a rare exception.) So code reuse implies a fork. As the author points out, this sort of thing has resulted in a huge number of slightly different copies of standard functions.<p>Github is helping a little; enough projects now use Github that it&#x27;s the repository of choice for open source, and Git supports pull requests from outsiders. On some projects, some of the time, they eventually get merged into the master. So at least there&#x27;s some machinery for convergence.  But a library has to be a project of its own for this to work.  That&#x27;s worth working on. A program which scanned Github for common code and proposed code merges would be useful.<p>Build tools remain a problem. &quot;./configure&quot; is rather dated, of course. The new approach is for each language has their own packaging/build system.  These tend to be kind of mysterious, with opaque caching and dependency systems that <i>almost</i> work. It still seems to be necessary to rebuild everything occasionally, because the dependency system isn&#x27;t airtight. (It could be, if it used hashes and information about what the compiler/linker/etc actually looked at to track dependencies.  Usually, though, user created makefiles or manifest files are required.  We&#x27;ve thus progressed, in 30 years, only from &quot;make clean; make&quot; to &quot;cargo update; cargo build&quot;.<p>The interest in shared libraries is perhaps misplaced.  A shared library saves memory only when 1) there are several <i>different</i> programs on the same machine using the same library, and 2) a significant fraction of the library code is in use.  For libraries above the level of &quot;libc&quot;, this is unlikely. Two copies of the same program on  UNIX/Linux share their code space even for static libraries. Invoking a shared library not only pulls the whole thing in, it may run the initialization code for everything in the library. This is a great way to make your program start slowly. Ask yourself &quot;is there really a win in making this a shared library?&quot;<p>Shared libraries which are really big shared objects with state are, in the Linux/UNIX world, mostly a workaround for inadequate support for message passing and middleware. Linux/UNIX still sucks at programs calling programs with performance comparable to subroutine calls. (It can be done; see QNX. When done on Linux, there tend to be too many layers involved, with the overhead of inter-machine communication for a local inter-process call.)",1419916198

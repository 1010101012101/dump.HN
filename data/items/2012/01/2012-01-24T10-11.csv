I'm Norwegian, live in London, and spent three years regularly flying in to SV, and it took me 16 hours door to door with a direct flight from London. You'd probably need to tack on another 3 hours or so for a connecting flight most of the time...<p>> I would be willing to work for a hell of a lot less than $100k.<p>Careful. Potential currency risk. If you do, make sure your salary isn't specified in dollars or that it's adjusted up a <i>lot</i> to account for currency risk.<p>> What do you guys think? Should I take my dream and smoke it in a crack pipe, or is there some non-negligible chance of this actually being possible?<p>Doesn't hurt to look for opportunities. In my case I did it because I joined a startup where one founder was British and the other really love it in London and wanted an excuse to move back, but in the end the company ended up in SV due to VC's. I knew one of them from before (we'd worked together) and so got in before the decision to stay in SV was made.",1327402280

I calculated my Norwegian  tax, UK tax and what I'd pay in California <i>including</i> VAT / sales tax, and while Norway came up on top, on my - way above average salary - total tax came out at about 39% for Oslo, and about 34% for California, and about 36% or so in the UK, before taking into consideration things like difference in health care coverage.<p>There are places in the US where the tax gap compared to Norway is large, but California isn't it.<p>It's <i>hard</i> to end up paying around 50% tax in Norway even including what you pay in VAT, unless you make a huge multiple of average salaries. You could of course add in employers payroll taxes (""arbeidsgiveravgift""; but in that case, don't forget to do that for California as well), but if so, you're considering it part of your income and need to adjust gross salary up accordingly too - I see people try to add in payroll taxes to inflate the tax number, but nobody takes the payroll taxes into consideration when comparing salaries, or when negotiating them.<p>The marginal income tax band is capped below 50% (when you add in state income tax, federal income tax and local taxes, the marginal tax rates in some US locations is not that far away either), and unless your salary is way above average and you spend it all, even with the 25% VAT adds up to <i>much</i> less because most people simply don't spend that much of their salary on buying top rated goods. On top of that, deductions reduce the gap. Of course if you live in the cheapest place possible and spend all your remaining money on highly taxed goods like alcohol and cigarettes and warm your house with petroleum, then, yes, you may manage to end up paying 50% or more to the government.<p>That said, overall you'd probably come out better in SF on the same salary due to the cost of goods and services. But the ""we pay so much tax"" thing from fellow Norwegians is a pet peeve of mine, after I moved to the UK, and, surprise, didn't actually pay much less tax.",1327401578

It's more a question of what people are going to be gainfully employed doing, if it's not the old things.<p>For example, one possible result of increased technology in manufacturing could've (in some hypothetical world) been steady employment but greatly increasing productivity, so e.g. the U.S. 2010 manufacturing sector employed the same share of the population as the U.S. 1960 manufacturing sector, but thanks to technology was vastly more productive, churning out lots more stuff per employee, with employees doing more interesting things than 1960s assembly-line drudgework.<p>That's one of the techno-utopian visions sometimes kicked around: for every job lost on an assembly line, a new job is created as robot technician. But instead the ratio has been more like, for every 3-4 jobs on an assembly line, a new job is created as a robot technician.

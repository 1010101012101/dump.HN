2133715,comment,2133170,2133607,0,0,kikibobo69,,,"I've been using Scala for about a year now. Started writing some test using ScalaTest, ScalaCheck, and Specs, and really liked it.  Then I solved some hard problems using Scala, with a lot less code, and a lot fewer bugs, than it seemed like we would have ended up with using Java.  I'd say about 99% of our codebase is still Java, but the Scala bits are quite noteworthy both for leading to something nicer to maintain over time (mostly by need no maintenance, or very very little), and for solving a hard problem without an explosion of Java boilerplate.  A more functional approach ends up being a bit easier to test. The collections framework is >awesome<.  For us it has been a slow, grassroots thing, and I don't think we are going to see a big bang, but those of us who have taken the plunge have a very hard time going back to Java.",1295827148

They executed assignments diligently and knew how to get straight A's.<p>However, many of these kids lacked basic critical thinking skills. They didn't read the news or have much of an idea of what was happening in the world around them. They largely did what they were told and didn't have the guts to question professors.<p>I'll share an anecdote:<p>At the very first meeting of a statistics course, we were informed that our assigned professor was sick and a new professor would have to fill in. A kid sitting next to me said, ""I already looked him up - he gives 60% A's. The last guy gave 65% A's."" I asked the kid if the new professor was a good instructor. He gave me a dumbfounded look and repeated, ""He gives 60% A's.""",1295827043

That does not, however, imply that the Judeo-Christian culture of guilt is any better. Most likely, each is better in some areas and worse in other areas. But it's difficult to beat up on two different cultures in one blog post.<p>> seems more like an ad hominem than anything else: ""Look at these barbarians in their shame culture, the shame culture itself must be barbaric!""<p>A common feature of a culture of shame is that it takes any criticism of any part to be an ad hominem attack on the whole. There are two different ways to read any criticism of a society: (1) ""Look at those barbarians!"" (2) ""That's wrong. They should fix it."" To the extent that a society prefers reading (1), I think that that tendency of that society is inferior to the contrary tendency of another society. To the extent that Western societies such as the United States also display a similar tendency, I think that the United States also has a problem.<p>This, however, does not imply that one culture as a whole is superior to another -- in fact, this over-generalization is exactly what I'm trying to criticize. All societies have problems of one kind or another. They should fix those problems, or at least try.<p>> Some people should be ashamed of themselves.<p>Sure, the 300 pound guy should be ashamed of himself. But that's a matter of conscience. It would be wrong for others to ostracize him, or to expect him to ostracize himself out of shame.<p>It's one thing for a person to feel guilt and/or shame when he realizes he did something wrong. It's another thing for an entire society to use shame as a means of forcing individuals into compliance even when the behavior in question is not obviously wrong, like playing Villager Number Six.",1295826513

But, here's the catch: it doesn't apply in prison! In prison, your 1st amendment rights are more limited, and something akin to the rational basis test does indeed apply. To quote the court:<p>""In Turner, the Supreme Court determined that prison regulations that restrict inmates' constitutional rights are nevertheless valid if they are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.""<p>So, despite the apparent silliness of banning D&D, it seems the prison was within its rights to do so. The prison system may, at its discretion, inflict all kinds of petty punishments upon prisoners. If you're sent to prison, your rights are sharply curtailed.

I would like to explain though why I think there is not going to be a bottom: physics is an experimental science; all physical theories have to be tested by experimental evidence.<p>I'm sure you know how much trouble string theory has had -- not because it is bad science, but simply because it is hard to come up with a way to test something that makes claims that lie at the limits of our understanding. Suppose though after decades of painstaking experiments we do come up with a Unified Theory (UT). But then one fine day someone notices some strange effect beneath that is not explained by the UT. What then? When Max Planck decided to become a physicist (end of 19th century), his advisor told him that basically ""everything in physics has already been discovered, physics now is only concerned about details."" We may feel the same way after we come up with UT, but even UT may be ""the tip of an iceberg"" that is actual deep reality.<p>As another illustration, the space-time is expanding at an ever increasing rate, and that space-time expansion is not limited by the speed of light. Some time in the distant future (a few billion years?), the background radiation we now see from the time of the Big Bang will be off limits because the Universe's boundary will have expanded faster than light. So the future scientists will be forever in the dark about how the Universe came about. They will generate some theories about it, maybe even close to correct ones, but they will never <i>really</i> know what happened in the beginning.<p>There are certain physical bounds (computational complexity, irreversibility of entropy/time, uncertainty principle, the speed-of-light limit, cosmological constant) that prevent us from knowing everything and which may be impossible to overcome. We should remain cautiously optimistic though, since pessimism is counter-productive. Also, hey, it looks like strong AI will be a reality one day, maybe it will answer those questions for us.",1295825286

For as long as I can think back there have always been people clicking every colorful link saying ""Click here! It's FREE!"" and ""Download for Free!"". Back then the nasty payload came from cracked software and games, stuff like boot sector viruses. I wouldn't put the blame for this on assembly language.",1295823821

I thought it would be cool to also have a website about it. So I used one of those geocities type of services to host my first website. I started doing reviews and listing upcoming concerts and stuff like that and soon I found my self maintaining a music website (rather than an IRC channel website). I started learning HTML & CSS, reading A List Apart and articles by Zeldman, Bowman, Mayer Molly and 456bereastreet. That's when I really got into web standards (when CSS Zen garden was created) and unfortunately started focusing more on the technology rather than the contents of my site.<p>When I was at uni. I dropped my side-project due to studying  and stuff but kept reading & learning about what's going on. That was ~2004 when table-less designs were all the rage. To some extend I regret focusing more on the technology (HTML, CSS, Javascript) instead of my goal (the music website) but I'm glad that I really know ""how to make websites"".",1295823772

I guess in times long ago age might have mattered, but now with such ease of access to the internet for most there are people who are at 18 more experienced (like Mark) than some 30 year olds, so what Mark has achieved (while fantastic) could be more impressive if it was done by a 30 year old who had less access to the resources Mark has used... does that make sense?",1295823749

However, every improvement of this sort added to a language is like a feature added to a product. It is not ""free:"" It increases the surface area of the language, requiring programmers to learn more to use it. Every ""improvement"" must be analyzed in light to whether the benefits outweigh the costs. My conjecture is that the costs will outweigh the benefits for the kilo-jillions of shops that are ""mystery corporations with slaving programmers,"" as you put it.<p>As an aside, I think that the complexity of the language is already getting out of hand. Although features like this can be found in ""little"" languages like Javascript, they were in from the beginning and form part of the language's substrate. Libraries, frameworks, everything a Javascript user touches will make use of anonymous functions with lexical scope. More complex features are built on these features. This matters because when a programmer learns how a function works in Javascript, he learns how everything works.<p>Whereas when adding the same feature to Java, it's just being bolted on the side. So when a programmer learns how these new so-called closures work, all he learns is about a feature that isn't being used as a component of anything else, it's just a feature. We add complexity but get very little in return, much less than from the same feature in a language like Javascript.<p>I am not trying to get into a flame-fest over Java, but I do think that there comes a time when any product matures, and ""improvements"" should be viewed with extreme caution because the product has reached a point of greatly diminishing returns. I suggest that Java is in that place.",1295823677

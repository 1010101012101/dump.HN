MySQL handles it easily.  Likewise, if you're dealing with a bigger app, you're going to want to be able to query data in more ways.  MemcacheDB is great for what it is: a key-value store.  It's not a replacement for a RDBMS.<p>In fact, you really can't create such a database as you propose.  The issue is that there are problems in computer science that grow at certain rates.  For example, sorting is an n * log(n) problem.  You simply can't do better than that.  That's how indexes work (very simplistically).  If you limit yourself to operations that you can do in constant time, you have hash tables.  You can't query a hash table except by key.  Distributed hash tables are decently well known systems, but they don't replace databases in most applications and you can't make them more database like unless you eliminate the property that makes them scale so well.",1231201979

From my experience in manufacturing, I'd say that the long-term reliability of lead-free solders is still rather poor. I don't have much confidence that electronic devices made after about 2005 will last 25 years. Maybe in a few years time, the reliability of lead-free soldering will return to the levels of lead based solders just before RoHS came out. \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substa...</a><p>When circuit boards heat up and cool down, they expand and contract. Ideally, a designer tries to match the coefficients (as much as is practical) so that all the components expand and contract at similar rates. Because they don't, the solder joints get stressed, and over time can become brittle and fracture. Then, they'll be intermittant connections that, depending on where they are located, may or may not cause intermittant operation, or a computer that shuts off/reboots when it is hot. A  motherboard has on the order of 10^5 solder joints.<p>Because of the speed of changing products, and the ease of doing so, and the very thin margins for distribution, there is no money left in the system to make repairing computers affordable or profitable. It has been cheaper for more than the last decade to discard computers than to repair them.

There are the occasional hits, but a hell of a lot of misses. And if you're sitting on the churning dust cloud that is the expanding edge of the boom / development, there's a hell of a lot of noise and false leads.<p>Truly enduring changes tend to be based in deep, deep technology, most are a minimum of a decade old, if not several, and the truly good concepts are decades to centuries old (there's a reason they keep emerging: they serve a real need). Fads are often fanciful, contrived, or serve a narrow set of interests.<p>Unfortunately it gets really hard to detect the signal amidst all the sound and fury.

2857863,comment,2856702,2857030,2,0,marcamillion,,,">You're right, but the good thing is that nobody is really giving S&P that much credit here. Yields on new gov't debt haven't risen significantly. Sure, people say if Fitch and Moody's raise them then it'll trigger sell-offs from institutional investors.<p>I think it's still too early to tell. S&P downgraded after the markets closed on Friday.<p>The real test should be this evening when the Asia session opens and into the morning.<p>Let's see how it plays out.<p>>Thing is though, the institutional investors who have policies of holding x% AAA debt can always change those rules. Because there's only so much AAA debt out there -- that's why it would be kinda bad for everybody if the US Gov't didn't carry ANY public debt.<p>The institutions themselves can't just change the rules. They have to work with regulators - who then can change the rules and allow them to change their portfolio allocation. It's not as easy as flipping a switch.<p>What's for sure though, every single financial regulator in America is working overtime this weekend.<p>>Suppose you're a fund manager of a huge fund with $40bn under management. A full 1/4 is T-bills. Your mandate is to hold 1/4 of your fund in AAA debts. Well -- where do you put than 10 billion?<p>That's simple for a hedge fund, or a private equity fund. But pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies - the real section of the financial industry that accounts for hundreds of billions, if not trillions of AAA assets, have to abide by regulations.<p>Take social security - legally, social security has to be invested in AAA gov't paper. I am not sure if the Treasury can change this rule easily - I imagine it can have some sway here, but there are other financial institutions that hold significant amounts of AAA gov't debt (central banks for instance) that are legally required to do so - by their respective legal jurisdictions.",1312754351
2857862,comment,2857214,2857214,1,0,rjd,,,"Recently I decided to use the ASP.Net MVC framework for a project and tried to combine the API into the web site project for ease.<p>It became quick to me all the mentions of REST within the framework where fictitious. What it actually is an object API exposed via HTTP, its not REST at all.<p>Thinking I mis-understood what REST was I started doing some research only to discover than no I was correct in my understanding (from white papers) and secondly almost ever single developer article I read (blogs) was wrong. There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what REST is out there. Its kind of disheartening to see how many people just don't get it, and are perpetuating falsehoods :/<p>ASP.net's main problem is technical. (and I assume this is the same for many languages) You can't have functions with the same parameters. You can't have a separate endpoint methods for POST, GET, PUT, DELETE etc... So if you try to shunt data objects around using it you can't just put them back where you got, of do smart discovery, to things i like from REST. So the whole framework falls to pieces, its designed to mimic REST, but not be REST.<p>For .net devs reading this I'd avoid the MVC framework for REST. But if you have to for what ever reason you will have to build your own ""verb"" dispatchers, and drop the use of ""action"" functions in your controller classes, only have one public method, the standard Index() one, expose nothing else. I may float my samples online at some point but I'm to busy at the moment so I hope this is enough to help.",1312754339

Anything else doesn't seem to make sense.<p>Also: If the US defaults, how does it go down?<p>Here's why I'm confused:<p>Given that the US can't default on its nominal obligations, how does it default on its real obligations, so to speak? Printing money, aka inflation, is one way, but there's always inflation. Does that mean that the US is always defaulting to some degree? I'm thinking no, because lenders are compensated for higher inflation with higher interest rates. Would the US ever go ""no, Chang, we're not going to give back your $10, sorry""?<p>Maybe someone can enlighten me.",1312754314

We focus hard on increasing strength, flexibility, durability, speed, balance, and coordination - in addition to more specific skills like climbing, vaulting. But creativity and play is one of the best parts of parkour - finding fun or silly ways to wiggle through tiny spaces, swing through a jungle gym, or games to play in a field.<p>Seeing the changes in our students' attitudes when they first walk into our gym versus after they've been training for a year or two is amazing. They look healthier, they are more confident, and they are happier.<p>Parkour is more than just a trend in the fitness industry - it has the breadth and depth of something that is rooted in what the human body was designed to do. It isn't a game (contrary to the OP's post), it has no rules, it has no rankings or belts or levels. It's scalable to any person at any level of fitness and it's capable of constantly providing new challenges.<p>So I'm not exactly sure where you're getting your facts from, but it's likely based on shitty youtube videos of dumb kids jumping off of their roofs. Misconceptions from these videos are something I've spent years fighting, educating people one at a time.",1312754133

I don't know what to expect in the industry, so what does a Computer Scientist do in high tech companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, etc...)?  I know a friend who works at a certain airline and he says they hire engineers and teach them how to program because CS majors do not know the engineering lingo.

I live off of Minecraft's success at the moment (I created the linked Minecraft wiki and also the Minecraft forum) and I often find myself disagreeing with articles about why the game is so successful.<p>I think the single biggest reason Minecraft has such success is completely accidental, something Notch never consciously caused: Minecraft is a <i>creative</i> game, a game that you need to be <i>creative</i> to enjoy properly, and what do creative people do? They share their creations.<p>Minecraft came at the perfect time, it came when indie games were becoming more popular, when Youtube video series about video games (""Let's Plays"") were rising in popularity and at a time when the internet had become <i>very</i> social, it's so incredibly easy to share content now. If I want 100 people who don't play Minecraft to see a creation I've made in Minecraft it's very easy for me to do that, 5 years ago it would have been close to impossible to do this because the only real place to share content would be the forum for that game, and everyone on that forum would already know about it, so spread of the game would have been severely limited.<p>Minecraft is a fantastic game and of course if the game was bad it would never have been popular, but the success is in my opinion entirely an accident and a matter of being in the right place at the right time, nothing Notch could ever have expected or intended.",1312753989

Full integration tests that test the whole system with real dependencies (real db, real services)<p>works quite well.<p>The first set help you design and document your implementation through mock specifications.<p>The second allows you to assert the intended behaviour of the code without tight coupling to the implementation.

Obviously everything in Lincoln was staged, including their arrangement with the university to charge there.  Clearly they drained the battery <i>so that</i> it would die in Lincoln, as that's where they had prepared to shoot.<p>It makes sense from a TV perspective but it's unethical, especially given the direct harm it can have on livelihoods and the effort to transition off fossil fuels.  There's no substantive difference between doing what they did, and merely pretending that the car died when it had half a charge left.  Top Gear is a comedy show, but it isn't satire.  The audience has no reasonable expectation that when the hosts make claims about certain cars, they are being dishonest for the sake of comedy.  Sure, we know the challenges are staged, but that's not what this is about.

I am happy that I didn't have to write mouse handlers, keyboard handlers - because have I started doing that, I'd either got bored before managing to do something useful, or changed my passion towards low-level stuff before writing my first quicksort. I am also happy that I can write something without understanding all mechanismes behind it - that I can build some site with django not even knowing how http works, or play with some graphics having no idea about graphic cards. Sure, all of this stuff is interesting - but it's just too much! Low level guys did their job well, so now people who don't like machines so much can build cool stuff on top of that.<p>I don't want to praise ignorance - probably I will read some of the stuff he linked under the article - I just think it's ok that people can do something useful with computer not knowing all the details about it. It's worth knowing though - but just as you can have no idea about physics of sound and how piano works and write nice songs, you can build nice stuff with high level tools not knowing low level.",1312751630

(""Failed to wrap a query in a magic function to make it sort of safe"" is part of ""all cases."") You have demonstrated, by neglecting to use your ""correct SQL protection techniques,"" why non-prepared statements are absolutely terrible. You <i>cannot</i> have the error you just did if you train yourself not to use direct SQL queries, regardless of library. Querying via MDB2 or PDO (or doctrine-dbal, which is a superset of PDO) means you have to intentionally and willfully do something very out-of-the-ordinary to pass in raw data as a SQL query, instead of being forced to wrap your queries in some slipshod, maybe-works-maybe-doesn't homegrown function that has not been rigorously tested.<p>Don't reinvent the wheel.

2857733,comment,2854187,2854304,1,0,dagw,,,"Economics in One Lesson is a horrible book for people with no background in economics.  Within economics there are several schools of thought, and this book is little more than an outright attack by a proponent of one (fairly niche) school on another (far more prominent) school.  Despite its title it isn't an textbook, but a manifesto, and as such Hazlitt's goal isn't to educate you, but to convert you.  Hazlitt sets out to do this with great skill, employing every rhetoric tool at his disposal.<p>And I'll admit he's really good at it as well. He presents theories as gospel truth, making no mention of any caveats or qualifiers that you'd find in a more serious work.  There is a complete lack of any sort of critical analysis of the ideas present, or any notion that they may be anything other than universal truths.  He greatly misrepresents the ideas of his opponents and loves to use quotes out of context.  He makes great use of leading rhetorical questions to lead the reader to make incorrect conclusions, without having to stick out his own neck and make the incorrect statement himself.<p>So in my opinion the real problem with this book is that it is so convincingly written that a naive and uncritical reading of it will lead the reader to come away with the belief that economics is really simple and that all economic problems have trivial solutions, as spelled out in this book.<p>That being said, the ideas present in this book aren't completely without merit, it's just that the few actually useful and interesting nuggets are buried in far too much polemic brow beating",1312751363

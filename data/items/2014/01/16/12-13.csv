He just asserted they are using one of the most used mathematical tools incorrectly, that it&#x27;s because confusion in naming and that it should be disposed of. He didn&#x27;t give one example of mistakes happening because of it.  \nNow, people who follow him and believe that he is some kind of authority may start distrusting science or academia (as he is actively hostile vs both) exactly the same way anti-vaccination people do: just because some celebrity told them so.  \nThere is value in calling people like him out on their nonsense.",1389876701

Would you know of other uses?<p>Do you know of some kind of tutorial of how one particular bayesian engine is applied to a particular dataset in a commercial venture?<p>Also, I have been looking at weka (<a href""http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/</a>), and j48 in particular. j48 is an implementation of the C4.5 algorithm, (which is close to ID3 and C5).

Which is different than traditional Bayesian analysis, where we calculate probabilities of a property being true. In his theory, he claims one can calculate the probability of a property being a necessary condition, the probability of a sufficient condition to another property (and the probability of both combined). I&#x27;m really having trouble understanding the ins and outs of this too. Have you heard about an usage of this theory?

Is OSX usable on that? I recall 10.5 (and older) being horribly &quot;crashy&quot;; 10.6 was far better for me, but it was probably the desktop software I was using that was causing system instability.\nWhat&#x27;s the battery life like?",1389874472

As I said, this was originally implemented to prevent slum landlords from using violence to drive out tenants who benefited from statutory rent controls.<p>No UK government has ever passed any law that legalises or permits squatting.",1389874353

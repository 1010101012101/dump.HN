4143326,comment,4141410,4141410,4,0,robomartin,,,"I'll be the one voicing a contrarian opinion here.<p>vi and vim are holdbacks from the days of 300 to 9600 BAUD modems.  A time when more sophisticated interfaces were prohibitive.  Back in those days it wasn't too uncommon for people to actually write their own text editors. I wrote a few, mainly in Forth, as I would bring-up self-designed systems.<p>While I use VIM today when I have to I continue to think that in today's context these things are, well, ridiculous.  There is no reason that the terminal can't switch modes on you and allow text editing with the same (or very similar) UI that traditional simple GUI editors provide.<p>The damn text box I am using in this browser to enter this comment is far more user-friendly than VIM.  There is no reason for a modern terminal to continue to support something like VIM.<p>Put another way, I had editors running on 6502-based 2MHz clock (yes, 2 MEGA Hertz, not Giga) Forth machines that were far more user friendly than VIM or VI.  We ought to have better tools today.  In my opinion, there is no compelling reason to continue to promote something like VIM.  Put a bullet in it already.<p>As for the hack.  Lots of fun.  But, geez, how fucked-up is an text editor that you have to come-up with a foot-switch to make it more usable?",1340301549

Dropbox were sponsoring a CS project fair at my alma matter which I stopped by at. They handed out t-shirts (quite nice ones) to everyone there.<p>For dropbox, college students represent both their potential customers <i>and</i> their potential talent pool. It can be a bit of a bun-fight to recruit the most talented graduates, and the more you can do to get your brand across the better. And of course, students are going to wear those t-shirts across campus, getting hundreds of eyeballs every day.<p>Not to stereotype college students, but they if they're anything like I was they like free stuff, hate doing laundry (so an extra t-shirt is appreciated), and spend lectures frequently googling random crap (like the name on the person's t-shirt next to you).<p>(PS: If anyone from Dropbox is reading this, I am very sad that my less than a year-old Dropbox t-shirt developed a hole in it.

For the people it actually targets its misleading to talk about which spot the camera is metering on.<p>That section was for people who were using camera phones with on screen touch focusing (the iPhone camera app also adjusts the exposure for the area where focus was selected). The section on dSLR spot focusing was to explain how to do that with dSLR's if you wanted to.<p>The next chapter on frame exposure settings goes over using exposure compensation.<p>Your only valid criticism is that the Aperture chapter's photo is poorly exposed.",1340301524
4143318,comment,4143200,4143200,2,0,bstpierre,,,"It's an interesting methodology. Some thoughts:<p>(1) 12 times is way too low for number of wears. I'm probably extreme, but I've got tech shirts that could apply for a drivers license; I've easily worn some of them hundreds of times -- let's say every other week for the last 500+ weeks. (The older shirts are too worn thin/ragged to wear in public any more though.)<p>(2) I'm not sure CTR is going to be as high as an explicit ad. Clicking a link is a fairly low barrier, and still only gets a 0.14% conversion. CPC is probably the wrong model to apply; you might want to look at it as traditional advertising and apply a CPM. For what it's worth, I'd bet that your conversion rate would be higher than average since the visitor has already qualified themselves somewhat more than just a casual clickthrough.<p>(3) For all of the times I've worn those tech shirts, I can only recall a couple of times when someone has actually talked to me about one of the shirts. Once (a nice polo shirt with embroidered logo) I was asked if I worked for the company (which was somewhat well known) -- the answer was no. The other time was when a fan of the by-then defunct company mentioned on the shirt remarked that it was too bad the company had imploded.<p>(4) I've gotten free t-shirts that required very little engagement on my part with the company. E.g. rackspace sent me a shirt several years ago I think just for answering a survey; I've never been a customer. Definitely consider giving shirts to people who can actually talk about you if someone <i>does</i> ask about your company. IOW, the CPM on a ""talking billboard"" is worth more than on a static billboard.",1340301514

4143306,comment,4143200,4143200,1,0,maxko87,,,"I think this is a cool calculation, and the numbers seem pretty reasonable. One benefit from tshirts that isn't taken into account here is simple exposure -- even if someone who sees the shirt doesn't follow up on the company themselves, let alone become a user, they are at least more likely to remember and recall the name. (Coming from MIT, it seems like Palantir and Dropbox had a lot of success getting good word-of-mouth campaigns going because of their stylish shirts).<p>Also, quality does matter.

I had very little idea of what was going on in the operating system and the userspace runtime, and it didn't matter because the creators of the OS and runtime were smart and the system behaved sensibly.<p>I thought I knew what was going on, I had this feeling that I was in control of the computer, but really I wasn't, I was just as much at the mercy of the operating system maintainers as I was when I ran Windows. If a command line program reported an error or crashed, the procedure to fix it was identical to the one on Windows: ask your friends, or search the Internet.<p>It was only after many years of doing system level programming that I was actually able to fix problems that the original tool creators did not anticipate.<p>I think many people park themselves in front of a command line for five minutes, ""learn bash"", and think ""hooray I am in charge of the computer"".

4143296,comment,4141410,4143012,1,0,dsrguru,,,"Note: this post assumes Vim, not other implementations of VI<p>If you type fast, you don't want to have to spend time correcting for line estimations that are slightly off as a result of thinks like 20h.  For navigation, just use forward slash to search and you'll land right where you want.  It's also almost always faster to use f/F/t/T in conjunction with semicolon or comma for jumping to specific letters than using h or l.  The # and * keys are also useful for jumping to words in a specific line.  Failing all of /?fFtT#*, it's still going to be faster to use ^0$wWbBeE than hl unless you're one or two characters away from where you want to be.  But you shouldn't even need to navigate much within lines, since text objects let you edit entire units of text, regardless of where the cursor is within those units.  People who come from an emacs background (and use the default editing environment instead of evil) can't even imagine how powerful Vim is as a raw editor until they try it.

And the occurrence of a single point failure that can take down an entire system that is deemed low-risk seems to happen an awful lot.<p>It not only occurs in the technology industry, but also even in things like financial risk analysis.  For example, people could mitigate the risk of a bond defaulting by buying a credit default swap.  However, most people failed to assess the risk of their counter-party going belly up, like AIG or Lehman.  This failure in risk assessment is in large part why the financial crisis was so widespread.",1340300870

As a result a lot of the Metro apps I've used are just very basic and lacking features -- or they have to jump through hoops to make a UI workflow for powerful features.

Tomorrow you read a story that says ""Twitter was down for one hour yesterday"" with some detail about what happened.<p>I believe that the latter is preferable.

From KSR, we know that it's this person who's the baseline for determining which, if any, inferences or creative steps are obvious.<p>If a person NOT falling within this definition were to independently arrive at an invention and could have arrived at the same invention prior to the issuance of that invention's patent, then there's an issue. KSR states: ""a person of ordinary skill in the art is also a person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton."" It follows that a hyper-creative, one-of-a-kind person who proves that he or she independently arrived at the invention would not be this  hypothetical person. Although obvious to a genius in the art, it was non-obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art. That's where I disagree with your reasoning.<p>EDIT: This is not to say that the genius in the art should be out-of-luck. He or she should be entitled to continue practicing the invention, but the patent itself shouldn't be invalidated. This should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and treated as an exception to the general rule.",1340299283

Yet there is a nonzero probability that it will occur.<p>On one hand this seems like an absurd example, yet it exemplifies the kind of blind spot we are prone to when assessing risk.  We generally address all the risks we can directly control, then classify the rest as ""systemic"" which essentially means that we are not able to compute them so we're going to ignore them.<p>Yet many systems which we assume to be stable or predictable (governments, companies, markets, weather patterns, social trends, etc.) have unexpected aberrations now and then which can have very significant consequences.   Since these tend to impact most companies equally, the market will converge on an equilibrium where no firms do anything to hedge against these things.<p>Do you want to pay extra bank fees so that your bank can hedge against the collapse of the US currency for your checking account?  Probably not.  Do you want to triple your hosting costs to hedge against a massive US power grid failure?  Probably not.  The same applies to asteroid risk and sudden ice age risk.<p>On the other hand, if you have lots of money saved, you may wish to hedge against the collapse of one currency or another, and if your business would end if you suffered a few hours of downtime, you might want to invest in massive amounts of redundancy.<p>Every morning when we all commute to work we risk death.  Some exposure to systemic risk is considered acceptable, and part of the character of any person or business is the kind of risk exposure we tolerate day to day.  A doctor working in an AIDS clinic risks needle sticks and HIV, a startup doubling its users each month risks downtime but also risks a cash flow crisis.",1340299203

By ""bad"" I mean failing a basic novelty/obviousness analysis.<p>I think it's more of an issue in software because software developers are essentially producing tens of ""inventions"" a day, every day, any of which are potentially infringing due to poor PTO operation. Whereas in something like chemical engineering a patent might affect maybe a few hundred other well-capitalized firms at a single point in their process, in software for any given app/developer potentially multiple patents are implicated in the course of a normal day's work.<p>A lot of patent trolls seem to be exploiting ""we got here first nya nya"" patents. That is, they patent solutions to problems that the market has not deemed significant enough to solve yet (like in app purchasing, before the iphone). When the market does move and encounters these problems, the straightforward solution(s) are developed, and then in swoops the patent troll.<p>The PTO just needs to become more sensitive to the unique industry that is software development: the high natural rate of invention, the high likelihood for multiple independent similar solutions to problems, the fact that a problem hasn't been solved yet doesnt mean the first submitted solution should nor can be patented, etc.<p>I think if a patent holder can show ""but for my solution, you never would have solved this problem in a reasonably efficient manner"" then sure, let's protect his IP.

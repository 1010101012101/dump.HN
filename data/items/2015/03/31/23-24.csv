Taking a poor programmer and moving him to a quieter space improves his productivity.<p>I&#x27;d still like to see a proper modern scientific study comparing office environments.  It&#x27;s very hard to do correctly, because there are too many variables.<p>Also, there really are 10x programmers.  At my current job, the new programmer took a couple of weeks to do something that I thought would take a couple of days.  (and I was already familiar with the codebase, so my estimate of how long it would take me to do it was probably accurate)  That&#x27;s only 5x, but he&#x27;s be deficient in other ways, such as not noticing severe bugs until other people pointed them out.",1427846336

I&#x27;m used to editing as I go and I have the whole story plus a lot of the language in my head while I&#x27;m writing (or more often, typing - the composition part usually takes place away from the keyboard).<p>But once I&#x27;m done with a draft, the next day I go get it printed and then I go through it with a pencil, crossing things out and scribbling notes on it. Not being able to edit the paper version makes some errors suddenly visible (like misplaced subject errors that a spelling/grammar checker can&#x27;t easily catch) and more importantly it gives me a much better sense of the narrative pacing and suchlike.<p>I do very much appreciate the capabilities of a good word processor.

9300653,comment,9297935,9300304,0,0,jrockway,,,"The fact that the Chromium process is what&#x27;s compositing windows is relatively uninteresting to the end user.  It&#x27;s Linux with a different GUI system.  Ubuntu is ditching X11 also, as I understand it, so people other than Google appear to be prepared to redo Linux GUIs.<p>There&#x27;s Native Client, so you can write native code.  I believe there are things like Emacs for NaCl, though Emacs is relatively useless until someone also ports your favorite programming language, version control, etc. to this model.  For programmers, it&#x27;s tough to have to redo everything, and because we tend not to use the ability to run unaudited native code to install viruses on our machine, it seems like a lot of work for no reason.  For the end user, though, things are a bit different.  It&#x27;s a long road but ultimately computers that are easier to use and get fewer viruses is a worthy goal, I think.<p>Someone could port Firefox to ChromeOS if they found it to be interesting.  It would probably be quite difficult, however.<p>I use ChromeOS as my primary workstation because it removes a lot of headaches I have with computers.  I hate configuring things.  I just want a terminal with Emacs and a web browser.  ChromeOS gives me this.  I log into my laptop and it has the exact same configuration as my desktop.<p>ChromeOS auto-updates and takes 8 seconds to reboot afterwards.  It doesn&#x27;t nag me about  auto-updates or checking that Windows Defender is up to date.  All my work is saved somewhere other than my desktop/laptop, so if I lose the computer or get another one all I have to do is log in again.<p>It&#x27;s very much a thin-client thing, which some people hate, but I find quite suitable for my normal workflow.  sshing into a Linux box is generally great for doing work.  Using the GUIs is an effort in frustration.  ChromeOS solved that issue for me.  (Yup, I need an Internet connection to get to my ssh-able Linux box somewhere.  I always have one.)<p>If you are convinced Google is out to get you with configuration syncing, SSH clients that run &quot;in a web browser&quot; (but are native code and preserve all keybindings that you&#x27;re used to), and &quot;cloud storage&quot; then ChromeOS is probably not for you.  Enter developer mode (one keypress) and install your favorite Linux distribution instead -- all the patches necessary to make the devices work are in the open source tree, and unlike with Linux on random Windows laptops, your WiFi will work and you&#x27;ll get the advertised battery life.<p>I have given ChromeOS laptops to family members where my previous attempts at giving them computers have failed.  A year later their laptops are running the latest version of the OS and didn&#x27;t have any viruses.  I even got them using two-factor authentication with security keys!  I was surprised.<p>Disclaimer: I work on ChromeOS as my 20% project.  But I work on it because it solved a lot of my computing problems and I find it worth my time.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time advocating to help my employer sell $149 laptops.",1427845645

A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination&quot;<p>&quot;We perform a field experiment to measure racial discrimination in the labor market. We respond with fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perception of race, each resume is assigned either a very African American sounding name or a very White sounding name. The results show significant discrimination against African-American names: White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects the benefits of a better resume. For White names, a higher quality resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks whereas for African Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase. Applicants living in better neighborhoods receive more callbacks but, interestingly, this effect does not differ by race. The amount of discrimination is uniform across occupations and industries. Federal contractors and employers who list Equal Opportunity Employer&#x27; in their ad discriminate as much as other employers. We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names. These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market.&quot;<p>Turns out names DO have an impact on your life.",1427845512

Recently I have been working exclusively with React.js + Flux and Node.js to build isomorphic web applications. I like the fact Meteor is isomorphic by default and comes with everything you need. I have always somewhat seen it as this outlier, a great looking framework but lacking the same vocality that Facebook and Google can give their respective libraries and frameworks.<p>Even seeing Meteor from a prototyping perspective it looks like a great tool. The integration with MongoDB (3.0 is fantastic by the way) and ability to quickly create and work with collections from within your Meteor applications without really needing to glue anything together or configure is something that appeals to me (especially as a front-end developer who is asked to prototype things quite a lot).

9300516,comment,9295964,9300035,0,0,npunt,,,"I respectfully disagree, there&#x27;s only two raw deals I see with your example: buying a 16GB model, and going to Best Buy.<p>There were always 6 SKUs for any given region (3 size options and 2 connectivity), and now there are 3 colors, and the iPad Mini form factor. That&#x27;s a lot when you add it all up analytically, but that&#x27;s not how consumers experience it -- they&#x27;re not presented with 36 different iPads and asked to figure it out.<p>The consumer experience hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed since the original iPad, because each option is understandable by the user rather than buried under a confusing set of names [1]. iPads with cell radios are really only for people who already know what it is and want it, so that choice point is reduced. The form factor (iPad or iPad mini) is something the consumer can hold in their hands and figure out, as is color. Those are tangible, immediate, human choices.<p>RAW DEAL #1: Storage, and specifically the 16GB model, is the biggest issue with iOS products because later you&#x27;ll find you can&#x27;t download many apps or have too many photos before storage fills up. Bad user experience. See past iOS upgrades for outrage.<p>> if you don&#x27;t already know what you want<p>Apple has invested <i>huge</i> amounts in iPad&#x27;s branding and awareness, that translates to consumers understanding more and walking in having at least a vague understanding of which form factor and color they would like, with a visit being more of a confirmation of the choice. Note that Apple&#x27;s other branding reinforces this, by sharing color across iPad, iPhone, and now MacBook, meaning more possibility for consumers to come in closer to having made a choice. Same with storage capacity if they evaluated iPhones. They also don&#x27;t name it something different each time they launch a new one, they reuse the name [2]. The brand value/awareness of &#x27;iPad&#x27; alone is probably 100x+ that of Asus or Surface. Brand awareness persists between products, so with 800m iOS devices out there, each SKU represents maybe 20m iOS devices worth of brand recognition that precedes it [3].<p>RAW DEAL #2: Walking into Best Buy -> raw deal. For. sure.<p>There&#x27;s a reason Apple built stores - its to control the experience and reduce choice anxiety through consistent messaging, better presentation of products, positive sales experience, few choices, etc. Best Buy shits that away and you wind up in a chemical-smelling store filled with crappy products that subtly increases paradox of choice, talking to a spikey hair drone that doesn&#x27;t understand the product, forcing comparison to unlike products, putting pressure on you to buy the replacement plan or accessories or shit you don&#x27;t need, with flashing images from a wall of TVs nearby sucking your attention away from your purchase decision like the TV with a skateboarding video on at the bar you&#x27;re at with friends that keeps pulling you away from the conversation you were just having. Ugh. Best Buy.<p>[1] Apple made this mistake in the 90s with the Performa brand, introducing too many models causing consumer confusion (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Performa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Performa</a>). Thus, iPad is iPad, and specs do not play into the name of the product the user buys. Most other competitors such as aforementioned Asus Zenbook UX305 <i>just don&#x27;t get it</i>.<p>[2] Because people think in years, not obscure model numbers (&#x27;oh thats the iPad from two years ago&#x27; vs &#x27;oh thats the Zenbook umm... UX31A? UX42VS?&#x27;).<p>[3] Yeah this is a super janky way of representing brand awareness, its just to illustrate how much more carrying capacity the brand has for variations relative to others. Marketing budget might be another way, except that doesn&#x27;t account for people&#x27;s actual purchases and their sharing with friends, plus the ridiculously valuable free marketing you get from the media talking about the device. Hence, the big unveil strategy.",1427843502

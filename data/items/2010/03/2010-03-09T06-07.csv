1177715,comment,1177342,1177412,0,0,Adaptive,,,"Excellent comment.<p>Most non-technical professional firms I've worked in evaluate performance solely on results. We book our own flights, we schedule our own meetings with clients, etc. In other words, the company expects us to be grown-ups and one either meets those expectations or ceases to be employed.<p>I've also worked for companies that are obsessed with hours. The worst was a software firm that was focused on an increasingly complex set of ""flexi-time"" rules designed, on the surface, to allow flexible work hours while maintaining some common work time and also enforcing ""fairness"".<p>In reality, I found that it was really just a way for managers to avoid having to deal with cracking down on lazy workers. Without the byzantine set of flexi-time rules they would have had to confront dead-wood employees and can them. The software firm was unsurprisingly filled with engineers with poor people skills that had become managers and were uncomfortable doing this.<p>Hire carefully, have high expectations, make them clear, be goal and result oriented, check in often and communicate well, and fire people that don't get their work done.<p>100% agree with comment above. I've never, ever seen a functional, professional services company where working from home was the norm or even a good idea. It's just that, as an adult, it's sometimes the <i>most</i> useful, necessary, and <i>responsible</i> choice.",1268117836

I remember sinc looking marginally better than bicubic, but not significantly so for most images (which is probably why Photoshop didn't implement it at the time - I don't know if it does now).<p>How hard it is depends on what you mean by hard. Coding these algorithms took an evening or two, but I didn't know about the gamma problem until I read the link in these comments, so it is not trivial.",1268114981

Anyway, i'm going to muscle through with or without a co-founder. I just want to see this thing exist. And I want to do it right. Thanks.",1268114869

Here's what we have so far:<p>- Its about monetizing twitter<p>- Needs someone familiar with social network ad rates and companies that buy social advertising so that he can price his product properly<p>- ""Ridiculously simple"" that it can be summed in 1 sentence<p>- <i>Not adwords for twitter</i> apparently, claims he's never seen this done before.<p>The fact that he needs someone familiar with selling to companies means the buyers will be businesses. The fact that its monetizing twitter means his publishers will be twitter users. So he'll be facilitating advertising from businesses to tweets on twitter users. I suppose publishers can join his network, select categories of products/services they're ok with tweeting about, and then get paid for tweeting out sponsored messages.<p>Anyone else have hypotheses?",1268114659

They don't discount heredity, as the old blank-slate hypothesis of human nature once did. Instead, they assert that ""genes powerfully influence the formation of all traits, from eye color to intelligence, but rarely dictate precisely what those traits will be.""<p>That's a pretty good summation of current human behavioral genetics research.

2597833,comment,2594521,2596937,2,0,munificent,,,"Traits aren't incompatible with classes at all. In fact, Tom van Cutsem, the author of traits.js worked on the class proposal that's going into Harmony.<p>Aside from the simplicity argument, I didn't see anything in Markus's presentation that showed an advantage of prototypes. His point example is cloning a point and then immediately replacing all of the state, so there's nothing there that classes couldn't do (in less code).<p>Your gist (especially the color point) is an example of using prototypes in a way that's hard with classes. Fortunately, adding classes to JS won't hurt that at all. You could just as easily do:<p><pre><code>    class Point {\n      constructor(x, y) {\n        public x = x;\n        public y = y;\n      }\n\n      add(other) {\n        return new Point(this.x + other.x, this.y + other.y);\n      }\n    }\n\n    let p1 = new Point(0, 0);\n    let p2 = p1.clone({\n      color: '#green',\n      toString: function() {\n        return this.color + ': ' + uber(this).toString();\n      },\n    })\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, adding classes to JS won't <i>take away</i> anything already there. It just gets a really common pattern and makes it much less verbose. The idea is to pave the common path of class-like inheritance, but not to build a fence around it to keep you in.",1306709514

2597810,comment,2596471,2596471,1,0,captaincrowbar,,,"I don't think the legacy x86 code issue is anywhere near as big a hurdle as many people seem to think, because Apple have a weapon there that Microsoft doesn't have, and Apple didn't have (at least to anywhere near the same level) during the 68k/PPC and PPC/x86 transitions: Xcode.<p>Just about every native Mac app these days was developed and built on Xcode, and Xcode already supports ARM targets. The only remaining obstacle is porting AppKit to ARM, and if (as the original story suggests) Apple already have hardware running OSX-on-ARM, they must have already done that. That means most Mac apps can be ported from x86 to ARM with little more effort than changing the target in a dropdown list and hitting Build.<p>(For those not familiar with Mac development: AppKit is the GUI library, part of Cocoa, used in most modern Mac apps. iOS apps use a slightly different GUI library, UIKit. At the moment AppKit only targets x86/x64 and UIKit only targets ARM, at least in the officially released versions.)<p>Microsoft can do something similar with .NET, as others have pointed out, but .NET apps don't dominate the Windows software ecosystem to anywhere near the same extent that Xcode+Cocoa dominates the Mac one.<p>(One thing I'm quite certain we're not going to see is the hypothetical dual-CPU ARM+x86 machine that some people are speculating about.

This includes the gap at the PN-junction. Once this gap reaches a certain size (currently estimated at approximately the width of five silicon atoms), quantum effects (strong force, weak force, et al) begin to overtake the electromagnetic force that allows the transistor to transist.

Neurons have complex behaviour in and of themselves, and maintain various kinds of state that persist after action potentials (i.e. after firing.) Transistors don't do that individually, so the analogy is quite bogus. Not only that, but connections between (synapses) are not as trivial as a simple wire and even engage in two-way communications. Considering each neuron may have multiple inbound and outbound connections, sometimes over (relatively) vast distances, counting the neurons alone is inaccurate.

If Postgres isn't using an index that you think it should, you should figure out the underlying reason why.  This would be akin to killing a fly with a sledgehammer.<p>2) The main thing that is going to impact whether a given index is in memory is how often that index is used, not it's size.  The advice about reducing the size of indexes is true (in that a smaller index uses less memory, which is always good), but if you have 10 indexes and you only actively use 1 of them, then those other 9 indexes aren't going be taking up much memory.  The biggest issue is they are going to slow down your inserts.<p>3) Manually vacuuming isn't really necessary for newer versions of Postgres (>8.3 I believe, where autovaccum is enabled by default).  There are times when you do need to VACCUM, but probably not that often in standard usage.<p>Here is some simple practice advice for postgres users:<p>1) If you are using an older version of Postgres, upgrade to Postres 9.  It has a lot of huge improvements over previous versions.<p>2) Purchase & read Greg Smith's PostgreSQL 9.0 High Performance (as mentioned previously by another poster).

It is sort of a perverse incentive and it is much better to encourage healthy habits (e.g. exercising, eating better) than try to stop people from doing things that they have an inclination to do. As an example, it is better to give someone who only knows McDonalds a good burger so that they go out of their way to eat a good burger (presumably less frequently) rather than creating a system that gives them a minor electric shock every time they show up at McDonalds.<p>I suppose you could make a case for RescueTime on the basis of monitoring your employees, but I'm also generally opposed to this also. You should basically only hire employees that want to do their job, rather than hiring people or tools to monitor and ""enforce"" productivity.<p>Which is to say, peak productivity comes from within and from being engaged in the project one is doing, rather than any quantity of external stimuli.

Example: if you chose mod_python for your web architecture today--a discontued (with prejudice: the sole remaining official maintainer hated it) project that I seem to be the only remaining user of and which (honestly, despite what I tell people) wasn't very good in the first place--over a proprietary alternative that actually had a working business model, like ASP.NET, solely because you could maintain the former yourself, that would /clearly/ be a very poor and highly costly decision for your company, and would easily allow a competitor to run circles around you on cost of development and maintenance. There may even be reasons why mod_python would be chosen over ASP.NET (such as a plausible, if painful, migration path to mod_wsgi combined with the now know to be incorrect preference of coding in Python ;P), but this one in specific is simply irrational.<p>As for Digium: an ecosystem (like Skype) is fundamentally different than a hosted API, and I'm confused as to why you feel it appropriate to compare them...

One fellow even had a camera installed to produce phosphenes via electrodes on his visual cortex. Science has gone well beyond external behaviours.

2597728,comment,2597553,2597553,2,0,barrkel,,,"There's more power in putting together a handful of common words in a powerful image or metaphor than a particularly apt selection of a single word, for several reasons.<p>Overuse of obscure words will reduce the size of your potential audience; Shakespeare wrote plays that were seen by a broad slice of the population and have humour and puns to match. It wouldn't have made sense for him to dig too far in this direction. Original words, meanwhile, are frequently formed by joining together two other words. Joyce was especially fond of this.<p>A vocabulary wielded almost like a weapon has far more value as a social signifier. Uncommon words are especially potent if they're capable of sending an adversarial interlocutor to the dictionary, because in the heat of the moment your opponent is left with only two choices: concede a point, or look stupid or uneducated asking what you meant.<p>Particularly precise words are also subject to some of the same problems that Orwell enumerates in Politics and the English Language [1]: lazy prefabricated sentence fragments that waffle around the proper thrust of the desired meaning. His essay is a strong affirmation of the value of plain English, suggesting effort be applied to original metaphor, simile and imagery instead.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm</a>",1306706598

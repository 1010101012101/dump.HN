I'm self taught and have been programming since I was in middle school computer club more than 8 years ago.<p>Working on this startup project has taught me that in the beginning it's all about delivering a product that works that users want.  When requirements are constantly in flux and you're working hard and fast to develop a fully functional prototype there's little time for code refactoring to make it ""perfect"" because the longer it takes to launch the larger the possibility that someone beats you to it.  As long as the code does what it's supposed to do and is not loaded with bugs and isn't terribly slow I say to just go with it.<p>Requirements are always changing in startup land and a good programmer adapts to make those changes and is focused on producing a workable prototype before their competition does",1315087169

Big guys actually do not care much.<p>People do not notice that. Such bugs (that can be exploited) are inserted into the kernel very often, even from legit people and no one notices. [1] I don't blame them, but we can't _trace_ it if it's been done by an attacker.<p>About your second link, once again, you limit yourself to attacking linux.git. Unless you crack SHA (which, is actually possible, it just looks terribly odd in the commit, and has nothing to do with flapping your arms to fly).<p>Instead you append commits to a repository Linus pulls from for patches, and you can do it so that when Linus pulls, he gets the extra patch, and when the owner pushes, nothing happens. Heck you can even hide it from the gitweb interface. You can even do that on Linus's linux.git directly, but since zillion people look at it, its much safer to go through a branch Linus will pull from.<p>Oh and the code isn't going to be a bind shell in the f. middle. it's going to be a dangling pointer or the like, that you know, these devs miss every other week as pointed out in [1] and bang, here's your exploit.<p>Do you think all attackers are that retarded that they can't spend an HOUR modifying GIT for this?<p>Keep the blind-folds on.<p>Bonus conspiracy theory:<p>Imagine they find such a commit, by luck or hard-work, signed off of course by someone Linus pulls from. They're going to do what? probably leave it there in a couple of month have a fix (that won't go in CVE as many of their fixes which aren't found externally). No one will be able to tell if it came from the attack (which would be a PR disaster for Linux) or not, even if uncovered.",1315086729

2958196,comment,2957954,2957954,3,0,RobertHubert,,,"From my experience or learning rather while studying psych I came to believe that as all successful or enjoyable actions are rewarded by dopamine (everything from grasping a spoon so smoking crack). Also, the more closely an action and its reward are pared to one-another in time the greater the strength of the feeling of ""that was a good choice or Success!"". 
So it seems to follow that giving in sooner rather than later (for some potentially greater reward - delayed gratification) rewards the brain more and does so faster thus reinforcing that behavior model more and more successfully over and over.<p>Because delayed gratification is well, delayed, the chemical reinforcements in the brain don't happen (or happen in some other way that is more conscious rather than instantaneous without reflection). So for a child who has not developed the ability to delay gratification it becomes now or never and that mental reward structure can really hurt them later in life.

In fact, I've already worked remotely from this location for short (2 week) stints in the past, and I found I had no problem getting the work done or keeping in touch with the team.<p>So why is it that every time I respond to a job advertisement claiming a ""remote"" position, the recruiters hesitate as soon as I mention moving away from the US?

Where discrimination was really entrenched and difficult to change was in government. It was racist government policies that really kept segments of the population down, and in fact, many of those racist policies still exist today.  For instance, the primary motivators of the anti-drug and anti-gun laws were racist.  ""Saturday night specials"" were regulated because they were popular among poor blacks for self defense.  The sawed off shotgun, which is actually safer (because the shorter barrel means wider shot spread and makes the firearm less lethal) ware popular among italians who wanted protection from the mob, so the mob leaned on white politicians and got them banned, good for the mob, and served white political ambitions, etc.<p>Where there has been no supply (the small country example) blacks, for instance, often would band together and form businesses that served their community.  This was inhibited by government regulations that would often deny them the ""license"" needed to operate that business... but it was not economics that kept those businesses from forming, it was regulation.

I was reading to see if I could judge how our app (which should be mostly accessible) might have worked for this person... but they never mentioned what their disability was in their sample letter, and so I had no clue, and couldn't hazard a guess. (Except maybe that they are blind? Though I don't have enough clues to be at all confident in that guess.)<p>I wonder if part of the non-response they got was because they never explained what their disability was in their letters.  I understand it really isn't some pizza restaurant's business to need to know it, but if they left that off, then it is hard for someone to understand their dificulty-- they might even read the email too fast and not even realize there is a disability at all.  Thus it just sounds like someone who can't describe why the real problem is, and is instead giving web development advice to a customer service rep who, more likely than not, has no ability to even parse the email into actionable or useful information for the developers simply because the context is dropped by missing this key bit of information.  (Even though the advice is useful to someone who is a web developer, even without knowing the disability, the CSR may not realize that.)<p>That said, I have gone thru a recent terrible experience attempting to deal with a company who is bringing in $150million a month in revenue, and can't be bothered to have CSRs actually read letters.  Over the course of a dozen back and for the responses, each form letter I got from them, was written by a different person, and seemingly responded to a random word or two from my previous message, where they clearly didn't' read the whole ticket or even take a few minutes to actually comprehend what I was saying.<p>There's some really bad customer service out there, even from companies that at least don't have lack of budget as an excuse.",1315085469

But most people find that it's easier (and more performant) to build, say, web applications using a programming language than by using shell scripts over CGI. Assuming you commit to a programming language, then you either then commit to multiparadigmatic programming and call out into shell whenever you need to do work like that, or you give up shell inside your program in favor of using the API tools inside the language. Outside of possibly perl, calling out into shell for things like that isn't very common anywhere I've ever worked, and with good reason.<p>Once you commit to a programming language instead of shell, then you have various types of IO to worry about. What you want might be in an array or list, a file, a database table, an xml file, or the response from a web service. Typically, you either need to write a decent chunk of code for each of these sources, either for abstraction or for marshaling.<p>With LINQ, all you need is a change in the upfront handling, and you can reuse the same comprehension logic across all the different data sources. This is a pretty nice deal, all things considered.<p>And really, one way of looking at adding comprehensions like this to languages is to make programming in languages more like chaining together code in a shell script -- something that programming in traditional Algol-descended languages is not normally like at all.",1315084755

If you have a ""No Coloreds"" policy, and the store down the road does not then yes, they'll get the black business you are giving up--but they are giving up to you the business of people who do not want to shop around black people. The latter is worth more to the bottom line than the former, so you'll actually likely come out ahead economically with a ""No Coloreds"" sign hanging out in front of your shop.<p>Then that business down the road decides they'd rather have half of the whites-who-don't-want-to-shop-around-blacks business rather than all of the black business, and out comes the ""Whites Only"" sign on their store. Yes, they have less total customers after the change, but the white customers are wealthier than the black customers and that makes up for the difference in quantity.<p>Now it gets interesting. The mathematics of this kind of discrimination turn out to be the same as the mathematics of a boycott of a small country by the rest of the world. (I don't remember where I saw this--it might have been in Posner's ""Economic Analysis of Law""). Unless the small country is completely self-sufficient, it loses badly. The net result is the discrimination <i>keeps</i> the blacks poor, and so they don't as a group rise to the point where the stores gain by integrating.<p>Humans in small groups of approximately equal status and means where everyone knows everyone else simply do not behave the same as humans in very large groups of widely varying status and means where people only know a small part of the group.

Several people (of which includes Bill Gates) have sold/shipped absolute crap code and are now amazingly rich.<p>Whoever codes it wins, it usually doesn't end up who codes it better unless the original has serious flaws that were not corrected.",1315083887

Ubuntu is easy to use, everything is completely logical. Windows is a bit more cluttered and some things are not clear from the start. Also (especially W7) asks your permission for about every single mouseclick, which I think will scare novice users more than it will do them good.<p>As for the experiment, I'm intrigued. I'd love to know how long it will take them to learn specific tasks (for instance, writing a letter, browsing the internet, and some more complex tasks like installing software,  configure the wireless internet or make a network connection).<p>As for testing methodologies, I'd make clear descriptions of the tasks and record how long it takes the students. More importantly, let the students make notes about their progress and problems.<p>Good luck with the experiment!",1315083719

We just splurged by getting a second car (used, paid cash), as I'm traveling to client sites more, and I've left my wife stranded at home for 2.5 years already.<p>Outside of some work equipment/supplies, we've definitely been working on saving and having liquid cash available.  We had multiple emergencies this year - my wife got very sick and we had an emergency room visit, and we had some deaths in our family which required a lot of travel.  In all cases we were able to pay cash from savings rather than charge it, which, 10 years ago, would have been my default way of thinking.<p>It'd certainly be nicer to have some sort of different health care in the US such that a trip to the emergency room didn't cost thousands, but it is what it is.",1315083613

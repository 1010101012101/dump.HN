When you have threaded comments, what happens is that people post their (often reactionary) opinions in response to OP, and then other people respond in kind to those opinions.

Having to skip out on your life and family to satisfy an advisor who &quot;sets expectations so high that they literally cannot be met&quot; is NOT ok. I have done this to myself and family before as well, and am old enough now to know that it is WAY unhealthy and detrimental to the work over the long term of months.<p>Honestly, it sounds like you are kinda Munchhausen-syndroming here. I mean, bravo for sticking with it and having the hardihood, but... dude.... wake up. Your advisor seems to be an ass. If they ride you this hard and trivialize all the hard work it is not helping you be a scientist, it&#x27;s helping them further their career. You are getting screwed here.<p>Also, you seem to be very confused as to why you are doing this. You claim  to not have a life outside of grad school and yet your life in grad school is terrible. You claim to love what you are doing but only after years of struggle and browbeating. From what little data you have shared (and thank you for doing so, I do appreciate it) you seem resigned. You advisor is not going to give you a good letter of recommendation. You indicate your science is not good enough for your advisor and do not refute this. You claim to be selfish but care about missing out on family and friends. You state your advisor is trying to make you a better scientist, but only discovered so after 5 years of their bad treatment. What is your plan? What are you going to do with your life? If this is what science is doing to you, you might want to reconsider. You seem miserable.<p>Back to the quotes; my problem was that he is self selecting out the good students. You advisor is a person you should trust. Writing an article like this sends out big red flags to anyone maybe thinking of working with him. I&#x27;d never work with the guy because I know for a fact he is a bad investment. If he had any students at the time of the writing, he just threw them all under the bus, along with most of his co-professor&#x27;s students. He tarnished the reputations of his lab, department, and school by saying those things. Mostly he tarnished his own reputation.",1400534511

If I don&#x27;t, I risk an unbounded but uncertain discount, depending on how valuable the content itself proves to be.<p>Both are uncertain, really.<p>> If I&#x27;m writing a piece on how to do TDD with rspec, that unbounded discount is nearly certain to occur, because the subject itself is fixed in time. But I&#x27;m writing a piece on using advanced statistics to optimize ad placement, or on why people shouldn&#x27;t use narrow-block deterministic disk encryption algorithms to encrypt individual files, the subject isn&#x27;t anchored to any particular time, and the discount I take for adding &quot;uncertainty&quot; by losing the dateline is unlikely to materialize.<p>Especially in the former case, its not entirely obvious that the subject matter is inherently not fixed in time (while the <i>statistics</i> may not be, the <i>application</i> seems to be very time sensitive.

And I don&#x27;t doubt that often, at least in terms of drawing certain types of business, concealing the date of information is useful for doing that -- there&#x27;s a reason why <i>ads</i>, even when posted in places where they will be exposed for a very long time, <i>rarely</i> have dates on information, and when they need to, its often in microscopic print in disclaimers.",1400534466

The team has been working on earlier iterations of this for nearly a decade now, and we have learned a lot along the way, allowing us to be very concise this time around. In addition, we have chosen a few powerful abstractions to make the actual implementation rather tiny.<p>That said, there is lots of work to be done, to make it, say, Rails, or Django-grade production ready, but the rough sketches are there and we are comfortable running a production app since December 2013, and we are working with a bunch of clients on their products, that we are comfortable with putting our reputation on the line for.<p>After 1.0 (we are pre), we want to be very explicit with the different levels of stability and maturity we ascribe to all parts of the system and the whole release overall. Our current production app handles 10k registered users on a small VPS without much sweat, so anywhere in that order of magnitude, with similar usage patterns, we thing Hoodie rocks the real-world, but if you are significantly diverging from this, we want to be careful and only recommend other’s to rely on Hoodie, when we have reasonable first or second hand experience of similar scale and use.<p>As for the socio-political statement: that’s definitely a big part of our motivation. We want to write and spread a story that isn’t the usual idea-vc-flip-sunset / abuse-overworking-cheating horror stories. And freeing data and empowering users is a future we want to see, so we are building it :)",1400533286

When I moderated Tagmax, I made it a policy to &quot;welcome people at the door&quot; and try to make their first experience a positive one. My observation was those folks who had a positive initial experience came back and participated enthusiastically. Those who had a negative first experience we seemed to never hear from again.<p>So I think you aren&#x27;t at all strange. I don&#x27;t know what the policies on MetaFilter are but my experience as a moderator suggests that keeping an eye on the site &quot;virgins&quot; and making sure their initial experiences are positive is super important in shaping the site and growing it.<p>I am sorry you had such a negative experience. I get a lot of value out of MetaFilter, though it has been a long process for me to figure out how to fit in. But, I am not you and some of my issues are specific to me, not to MetaFilter and ...yadda yadda.",1400533232

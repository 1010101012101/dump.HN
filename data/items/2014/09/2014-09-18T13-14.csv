From an HSM perspective it either makes that hardware now very useful or very useless.<p>Think of a large organization - you&#x27;ve been there (or not), there are 30 internal applications with self-signed certificates.  Fail.  The organization had purchased an HSM, but never really got it deployed because - well, that was too complex and it didn&#x27;t integrate well with 3rd party network hardware and failed miserably in your *nix web stack.<p>This could be interesting - and I&#x27;m not commenting with regard to the efficacy or security concerns around this, but mainly the workflow simplicity it provides to large organizations who end up in self-signed-cert-hell because HSMs don&#x27;t interoperate easily in a lot of use cases.<p>But to my original statement - this is a very good thing or a very bad thing for Thales and the like.  The only requirement for an actually certified HSM, really, is certification against some hardware and software standard you have a checkbox to fulfill.

It&#x27;s <i>super</i> scary, because you&#x27;re essentially offering a decryption oracle with your private key to the Internet.  It&#x27;s authenticated, sure, but even still you&#x27;ve actually increased your attack surface.<p>A compromise of an SSL terminator, or the ability to pretend to be one, gives the same capabilities as a compromise of the oracle itself.  The advantage you get is that only the last requires you to revoke and reissue the key when you figure it out(in other cases, simply unplug the oracle).  That&#x27;s relatively minor most of the time:  an open decryption oracle is already hair-on-fire levels of bad.<p>I can see why some organizations (for whom this process is unusually expensive) might be interested, but it probably isn&#x27;t beneficial most of the time.",1411048427

My broad points were:<p>* Busting the common misconception that &quot;branding&quot; was just about visual aspects (logo, style guide, etc.)<p>* That brand was an expression/aspect of product/market fit<p>* That rebranding is a kind of pivot.<p>* The large ad agency model of how to develop brands don&#x27;t work with lean startup environments coz they&#x27;re used to be being brought in to sell existing products where p/m fit is, to a large extent, already set. When it comes to p/m fit the Mad Men are on the green of the 18th hole. The branding folk for startups are still driving to the golf course and think they&#x27;re playing cricket.<p>* That there are a whole bunch of folk in the branding/marketing world who have been saying smart things about the relationship between product, market and brand — and we should be making friends with them and paying attention.<p>* That bringing in branding/marketing folk early on makes sense and thinking of your brand as something that evolves and needs to be tested is a sensible approach.<p>Like I said though.

Some of the individualism is probably also a reaction to the fact that we can&#x27;t all just settle into a pluralistic culture, because in the US, the first question would be &quot;which <i>one</i>?&quot;, followed by &quot;why <i>that</i> one?&quot; for almost everybody who doesn&#x27;t come from that culture.<p>Remember, a &quot;European country&quot;, which may still consider itself to have several distinct subcultures within itself, is generally only the size of an American state, and even within that division, a great deal more culturally unified than any American state.<p>In a way, telling Americas about how they need to be less individualistic is putting the cart before the horse... there&#x27;s no way to make that happen without massive, massive changes to the substrate of the entire country first. No matter how desirable or undesirable it may be, it simply isn&#x27;t an option open to the United States. Nor, for that matter, would I really go around wearing your cultural pluralism as some badge of pride as if it were some deliberate choice.<p>(BTW, keep trying to grow the EU and you&#x27;ll create the exact same dynamics within it, if they don&#x27;t already exist.)",1411047237

8334990,comment,8332614,8332614,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"The original, ancient, meaning of the word &quot;idiot&quot; was &quot;private person&quot;, i.e. a selfish, narrow-minded, ignoramus unconcerned with (and unsuited for) public life. Not &quot;stupid person&quot;.<p>We tend to conflate this first type of &quot;idiot&quot; (selfish person, unsuited to hold power) with &quot;constitutionally stupid&quot; and it gets us into all kinds of trouble. The people in power are idiots in the first sense of the word (unsuited to hold power, narrow-minded, provincial, etc.) but they are not unintelligent. In fact, they&#x27;re quite cunning and adept when it comes to holding power (those who aren&#x27;t, don&#x27;t last) and taking it from them is much harder than we expect it to be. They turn out to be just as smart as we are, but their intelligence is applied to getting and keeping power rather than whatever we claim to value (e.g. making the world better). This makes them formidable opponents, and we underestimate them at our peril. To crib from Paul Graham&#x27;s &quot;Why Nerds Are Unpopular&quot;, they spent all their energies on becoming popular while we spent ours on being smart and getting right answers. (Where Graham is wrong: &quot;the adult world&quot; is far more like high school than he admits. You have to be rich to get out of high-school-esque drama and into the utopia he mistakes for the whole adult world.)<p>All that said, we&#x27;re right (in technology, and in the arts) when we point out that society is corrupt and run by people who are generally out of their depth and unconcerned with general social advancement, aesthetics, or doing the right thing. It&#x27;s not that they lack the genetic ability or &quot;IQ&quot;-- they&#x27;re plenty bright enough, hardware-wise-- but that they&#x27;re lazy and self-interested. We&#x27;re wrong when we (as technologists) assert some tribal superiority, like we wouldn&#x27;t make the same mistakes, just because we have higher IQs. History doesn&#x27;t support this claim; it refutes it. Venture capital is a feudalistic, relationship-based business. Most of the companies we&#x27;ve built in the past 20 years have god-awful cultures. Silicon Valley (the physical place) is an overpriced lack-of-taste writ large. We mock &quot;the paper belt&quot; while failing to realize that we&#x27;ve created a worse one. We&#x27;ve mindlessly chased &quot;efficiency&quot; while failing to answer the most important question: what should we <i>do</i> with the value thus created? Hence, instead of curing cancer or coming up with an environmentally sound energy alternative, we&#x27;re stuck helping businessmen unemploy people.",1411046118

I feel that the one we have now is destructive to the fabric of society.<p>You made me think about a similar type of propaganda and a similar feeling my mother has. She lived through period when our country was a Soviet satellite state. Back in those times when you went to a cinema, instead of advertisements you were presented with video clips that elaborated on how much progress the country is making, how the productivity rises, how the working class successfully labours to make our country a better place, etc.<p>Everybody knew - my mother tells me - that this was all bunch of lies and exaggerations. But she also says that the overall climate was hopeful; people hearing good news everywhere actually felt like things are improving, changing for the better, that future will be brighter.<p>Contrast this with today&#x27;s proliferation of bad news. Everything is bad, everyone is corrupt, and who is not dead tries to kill you or take away your freedom. World sucks and is going to fall apart. We hear this all day, every day.<p>I guess what I miss about Star Trek and what my mother misses about socialist times is the same thing - hope for a brighter future.",1411045798

The main one is that Paths.js only builds a descriptor of your path (the string that goes into the &quot;d&quot; attribute of the SVG path tag), and leaves to you the actual rendering. This has, for me, a few benefits:<p>- it is easier to integrate into frameworks like React or Angular (because both these frameworks and D3 think they have control on what goes rendered in the page)<p>- you can use templating, which leads to a declarative approach, instead of the imperative approach of D3<p>- it only involves pure functions (no side effects) which makes it easier to unit test your graphics<p>- not doing the rendering means you can use Paths.js also on Node<p>Of course, D3 is more mature and complete at this point, and it is easier to find examples and documentation. I hope eventually to fill the gap, at least partially.<p>Another difference, although minor, is that D3 includes a lot of utilities (parsing CSV, doing Ajax requests, working with dates and much more...).

8334925,story,,,7,4,jnorthrop,"Ask HN: Doing something innovative with privacy?",,"I&#x27;m trying to find panelists to speak at RSA early next year[1]. I&#x27;m the CTO at the International Association of Privacy Professionals[2] and we&#x27;ve done some pretty cool panels in the past at RSA including a panel with the CPOs from Microsoft, Mozilla, Google and Facebook and another one with intelligence agency representatives (post Snowden). These have been packed sessions (500+ people) and have been well received.<p>This year we want to put together a panel to discuss best practices (or whether it is practical) to design and architect to meet the privacy expectations of consumers -- and do so ethically. Any side of the privacy conversation is welcome. The IAPP is not an advocacy organization so among our members are Axciom, members of the US intelligence community, people from Mozilla and the EFF, regulators from European data protection authorities and everything in between.<p>What I&#x27;m hoping to get from reaching out here (and I&#x27;ve been a member here for years) are people who are passionate about privacy and are doing something innovative or revolutionary in the space. It&#x27;s easy for me to find privacy professionals at large organizations (those are our members) but generally startups don&#x27;t join professional associations so reaching into that community is much more difficult. I know there are great things happening in the space and I want to give them a voice.<p>If you are interested, or want to suggest someone else, you can reply here or reach out to me at my work email jeff at privacyassociation dot org. BTW, if you are speaking you will get a free pass to the entire conference, but there is no funding for paying for travel expenses -- sorry.<p>[1] http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15\n[2] https://privacyassociation.org/",1411045212

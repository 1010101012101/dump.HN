Usage of Hadoop should be more driven based on the growth of data rather than size.<p>I agree that for the given use case, the solution is appropriate and works fine. Problem mentioned in the given post is not a Big Data problem.<p>Hadoop will be helpful in case if there are millions of games are played everyday and we need to update the statistics daily e.t.c. For this case, the given solution will hit bottleneck and there will be some optimisation/code change needed to keep running the code.<p>Hadoop and its ecosystem are not a silver bullet and hence should not be used for everything. The problem has to be a Big Data problem",1421657918
8911046,comment,8909367,8909367,0,0,eridius,,,"Skimming this, I just wanted to reply to this one bit:<p>> Befuddled users found they couldn’t send Pages 5 files through Gmail. It’s now fixed, as the What’s New in Pages screen proudly claims…<p>> > ° Updated file format makes it easier to send documents via services like Gmail and Dropbox<p>> …but how could such an obvious, non-esoteric bug escape Apple’s attention in the first place?<p>And the answer, if I recall correctly as to what was going on, was that this wasn&#x27;t a bug with Apple&#x27;s software at all. It was a consequence of the file format actually being a package, meaning it was really a document. Apple software all worked with documents just fine, and you&#x27;ll find that if you tried to use Mail.app to send it, it would all Just Work™. The issue is that Gmail and other such services never even considered the idea that a user might want to send a whole folder and did not have any way to support that.<p>So the &quot;fix&quot; was to change the file format to actually be a compressed archive of the package (I assume it was a zip file, but I don&#x27;t know how to go back and check). This made it work with all of the stupid software out there that assumed users would only want to transfer individual files.<p>Sure, perhaps the Pages team could have foreseen this issue. But that doesn&#x27;t make it a bug in their software, just a case of only prioritizing compatibility with other aspects of Apple&#x27;s software ecosystem.",1421657908

This means that thermal energy of the liquid medium will be exchanged between the ice near the surface of the ice body/bodies. Thus, the rate at which the ice accepts energy from the alcohol is determined by the surface area of the bodies of ice. A single sphere of ice produces the lowest possible surface area. On a graph of drink temperature vs time, crushed ice (highest surface area) would produce a large dip and then level out. The orb would create a broad valley of lower temperature, though never as cold as the crushed ice.",1421657834

Though sites like Elance/Odesk/Freelancer.com(GetAFreelancer back then) provided me a platform to start with, it didn&#x27;t take long before the cutthroat prices made it unsustainable.<p>The answer, which has been mentioned already by other commenters, is network. You need a great network and a great reputation. The real question is how do you build a great network? And how do you build a great reputation? As an introvert geek with only a drop of marketing prowess in my DNA, I struggled about the same questions.<p>One way I built my network is through Open Source Communities. Joomla! was just forked out of Mambo back then and there was an opportunity to participate in the then small community. So I joined the community, made friends with the right people, and I made a living out of building Joomla! Extensions. I also participated in other OS communities like Django, Kohana, and many others. The more I participated, the more my connection and reputation grows. The flow of projects from the connections I got from those communities allowed me to survive, and also thrive, which enabled be to build my own web development company (<a href=""https://www.wizmedia.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wizmedia.net</a>).<p>I think that marketplace sites like oDesk/Elance/99designs/TaskRabbit etc are horrible place to be in for creative people particularly programmers and designers. I&#x27;ve been looking for alternative places to go to but didn&#x27;t find any that is fair for both Clients and Freelancers. So it became an idea for my Startup that I&#x27;m building right now. That is Creatizens - <a href=""http://www.creatizens.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.creatizens.com</a>. It&#x27;s still under development, but you can read more about it here <a href=""https://angel.co/creatizens"" rel=""nofollow"">https://angel.co/creatizens</a>. The idea is based on the fact that the most profitable freelancers get their projects from their professional network - mostly from colleagues who has overflow projects, or ex-coworker whose company needs contractors. I don&#x27;t want to talk too much about it since I&#x27;m bordering on spammy so I leave it at that.<p>Cheers!",1421657546

However, I believe this must not be achieved by any kind of coercion coming from government. It may work sometimes (as in Scandinavian countries, but those are exceptions and I&#x27;m not gonna go into the details of why I think this cannot be duplicated), but ultimately, I think the gap can only be made smaller by free market and free trade, without government violence and coercion.<p>If you look at the wealthiest people in the world, those are the people who are either in power or close to power. Nobody will be able to make money by favoritism or coercion or corruption if there is no entity (e.g. government) that facilitates those things. Look at the world map. Which countries (again, with the exception of Scandinavian countries) are the richest and in which countries the lot of ordinary men is better? The ones where there&#x27;s more free market, not less.

You have a set of values, and you are in harmony with enough people, you can work for them, with them. The same applies in North Korea, and USSR (where I&#x27;m from). The country is a single company, the CEO might be eccentric, but people do have jobs, work hard, have education, healthcare and believe in communism. What they don&#x27;t have is Hollywood, McDonnalds and Fox News. And this is why you want to &quot;free them&quot;. They have nuclear weapons not because they are evil, but because they know what US does to countries people like you believe need to be freed.",1421655144

With $1B, I can hire 20,000 people for $50,000 a year.  I possess the things they think are necessary for their livelihood (the much-vaunted &#x27;means of production&#x27;), laundered through this thing we call an &#x27;economy&#x27;, and my ownership of those things is protected with force of law and custom.  My $1B is heritable, and according to the doctrines of personal property, essentially inviolable.<p>Is there a distinction between a billionaire and a dynastic prince of a small nation who can command up to 20,000 people for up to a year before they get angry enough at him that they stop listening?<p>Large amounts of wealth inequality implicitly distort liberal democracy - the thing that recognizes &quot;rights&quot; as a philosophical system of morality & ethics - and destabilize it.  There is no &quot;correct&quot; level of wealth inequality, but a system in which wealth inequality is growing in an out of control fashion, is an unstable system whose existence is threatened.  That this system is liberal democratic market capitalism matters little - this is not some kind of natural arrangement, it&#x27;s something we built, and it&#x27;s something which can fail.  Because people, as a whole, only respect what&#x27;s written on little bits of paper - only respect the customs and law of property rights and the existing power structure  - so long as the system provides them with the things they think are necessary for their livelihood.<p>Well, that&#x27;s our system.  Nearly all growth of the economy is ending up technically &quot;owned&quot; by a narrower and narrower minority.  For one reason or other, the economic equation has developed an unbalanced variable, and wealth is completely failing to trickle down... and our system can&#x27;t sustain this perpetual exponential growth in power imbalance forever.<p>Some of the greatest attacks on inequality were performed in part due to a very real fear that the whole system would collapse in a socialist revolution;  The fact that the Communists are fallen has made this less credible, and perhaps, for all their evils, that&#x27;s not a great thing for us.<p>Apparently, in the early history of currency, after we had gotten property rights laid down tightly and developed a fungible system of value, various civilizations developed a problem. Unlike the vague bonds of social obligation that they had previously represented, debts that are denominated in coinage attract contract arrangements with penalties such as slavery. This was accepted until surprisingly recently as an unfortunate necessity of life.  The elite discovered that the accumulation of slaves was a practical problem, because their customary service as cook or manservant or sexual partner took them out of the fields, and first currency crises were born: It was recognized that if the fields were left fallow, this was a worse outcome for all than the property of the elites not being sacrosanct.  The arrangement that was periodically arrived at was that the king would issue a jubilee,  freeing all the slaves to go back to their fields and their families, with no compensation to the elites.  When this was missing for a protracted period, slave revolts tended to pop up, with summary execution of the masters as a prize.<p>The system of norms (&quot;rights&quot;) is subordinate, at some level, to the proper functioning of a society.  It doesn&#x27;t particularly matter whether we call people with an indispensable debt that they need to perform service to partially mitigate, &quot;slaves&quot; or &quot;working class&quot; or &quot;debt peons&quot;.  You can only push them so far and still earn positive economic returns, and beyond that, in the full view of history, you can only push them so far and still keep your head.<p>Whether one is &quot;entitled&quot; to property is a view from so close to the ground one can&#x27;t see past the blades of grass.",1421654619

I don't mind meetings per se - in a good company, they have merit - but their effect on the work day can be disastrous.  If you don't work somewhere that understand that programmers need large uninterrupted chunks of time, well, you're not at a developer friendly place.  There's few worse problems.  And non-makers often don't have any idea that it's not just the standard 'coders are cranky' going on.  (We, as a group, _are_ cranky, mind you.)",1248292725

You can add as many cloud servers as you want to your cluster without worrying about locking or divvying up work, and the number of keys your cluster is able to check per second increases linearly with the number of machines.<p>The winning team, awesome guys with a cluster of 8 very powerful computers and a CUDA program, were able to check just over 400 million keys per second.  If I would have used 400 Rackspace cloud servers, it would have cost me about $100 to run them for the duration of the contest and I would have been achieving similar speeds.",1248292675

Just looking at that picture makes me laugh at how a sharp-shooter would ""snipe"" a select person in that crowd.  It's possible to jack up the FPS on a gun to shoot hot (and shoot further), but even then it's not really possible to guarantee a hit, given how a paintball is aerodynamically pitiful compared to an actual bullet.<p>Anyone else who has played paintball here can confirm that paint can easily fly several feet off its intended trajectory in as short as 40 yards.  In a crowd, just 6 inches would be enough to mark the wrong person.<p>So if they're trying to target a unique person in a crowd who is supposedly going to be arrested?  Highly unlikely.

My cofounder happily schedules meetings with various potential clients or contacts or other useful people to meet, and they tend to break up my day in disastrous ways. I do indeed find that often, a meeting in the early afternoon (say 1-2pm) can blow up my entire day (at least in terms of turning a day that could have been chock full with super-productive work into one that only contributes a few bits of real work here or there).<p>I like the tip about working from dinner to 3am, too, but doesn't that blow away any chance whatsoever of social life? If you have a significant other, I imagine that's a clear no-go. Also, if you plan to attend the odd networking event, you won't (or at least, a networking event will basically cost you a whole working day, which seems pretty disastrous).

718404,comment,717167,718201,0,0,kragen,,,"The WHO's figures are that in 2002, in the US, about 7400 people died of ""nutritional deficiencies"", broken down into 4300 deaths from ""protein-energy malnutrition"" and 2500 deaths from ""iron-deficiency anaemia"". That's a total death rate of 2.5 per 100 000 population that year. It's not one of the major causes of death, it's less common than suicide and far less common than diabetes, and it is indeed much more common in many other countries (the rate in Cameroon, for example, is five times higher) but it's a little higher than the estimates for more socialist countries like Canada, Sweden, Japan, and especially Finland. (But not France.)<p>If that rate were typical over our lifetimes, which seems optimistic (surely the rate was much higher in 1932, and for that matter in 2009) that would add up to a few hundred thousand deaths by starvation over the last 80 years.<p>These rates don't include deaths in which malnutrition was only a contributing factor. Malnutrition grossly increases the risk of death from infectious diseases, for example.<p>If you think that out of those hundreds of thousands of deaths, not a single one was caused by anything other than mental illness, you are the one with the mental illness. In fact, I think that just by posting your comment, you have demonstrated that you are really out of touch with the reality of what's happening in what I assume is your own country.

It needs to have a spatial file manager, and support for that needs to be built into the filesystem. It needs a UI spec that is set in stone and backed up with usability research. The I/O patterns for a file on disk, the display, mouse, and sound card are all different; to get the most out of each the OS needs to provide for each specifically.<p>These things are precisely what made the original Macintosh such a revolution: the designers at Apple were willing to completely rethink what an OS is and should do.

While the iphone is really great and stuff, you can bet that everything that's not absolutely necessary and even a bit more has been engineered out of it, in the name of cost-efficiency. Otherwise it would be very expensive and unsuitable for mass production. Because it is a product of mass production, the iphone is definitely not a unique, luxury item even though it's very well designed and marketed as a high-endish phone.

718377,comment,718043,718043,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"A few years back when I was working at a fabless chip design firm, I was assigned to manage and liaison with our overseas (Taipei-based) ODM partner when they came over here for CES. And I got to know the lead engineers and designers on their products that work out of China at the factories. After the shows we went out to party and just talked about random things and have been corresponding with them ever since. One thing that I've always wondered about was exactly this situation: the living and working conditions of factory (not just electronics) workers in China.<p>The response they gave was that while to outsiders, meaning non-Chinese, it may be deplorable, but they don't understand the circumstances. To a Chinese person that was raised in poverty, the slight bump in opportunity offered by the factory work is much more preferable than nothing at all. In a country where it's still mostly destitute and farming-based, the manufacturing jobs are sought after. The money they receive gets sent back to support the family or gives their next generation of children a shot at middle-class life. It is what it is.<p>The other thing they said to consider is this: there are a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of people in China. And they are all looking for jobs, any kind of job, to feed themselves and support their families. People are paid to sweep floors for 10 hours a day even if there's nothing there. People are paid to watch parked cars on the street to prevent break-ins even in safe neighborhoods. The access to this massive and cheap labor pool has benefits and allows for abuse. Laws and regulations are not able to save them all, for every illegal factory that gets shut down another one pops up down the road and before morning a line of people gathered based on whispering rumors will be lined up wanting to work.<p>People may suffer, people may be abused, people may even die but this process went on and on each time a country underwent an industrial revolution and decided that the invisible hand of capitalism was worth the price for admission to the big boys club. Be it children working on textiles in England to children working in coal mines in the United States. And for every human rights activist in the USA feeling guilty about paying $199.99 for a WalMart PC or $2.99 for a dozen socks at Target, there are a handful in China, trying to fight for not just human rights but also democracy, journalistic integrity, communist principles, or even Confucious teachings. Meaning, there are people equally, if not more so, concerned about this over there in China and Taiwan.<p>The point being that it's somewhat condescending to assume that Americans or Europeans know best how to solve every problem in China or any other country.<p>This suicide? Should be investigated. If people were at fault, bring them to court and prosecute them. Justice should be upheld and unhampered with, that's the best thing that can happen and should be the priority in this incident. Everything else is just a distraction, the name Apple is just thrown around for the extra attention. Would this have mattered if it involved another company like FastMaxChips Designs or Wireless Widget Corporation? It should and the investigations should all be treated equally whether or not a big name corporation is involved.<p>How to assuage your guilt about this overall trend? Considering the decades of cheap money, tech innovations, and better manufacturing/shipping logistics has warped our perception of value and pricing, I don't know how else to deal with it in a free market sense.

During this first year the young shoots strike skyward supported by photosynthesis from the rest of the clump with no time to sprout their own branches and leaves. Over the next year the pulpy wall of each culm slowly dries and hardens, sprouting branches and leaves during the second year from juvenile sheathes that form from each node. Over the following year the culm hardens still further shedding its juvenile sheaths and commencing its life as a fully mature culm. Over the next 2-5 years depending on species, fungus and mould begin to form on the outside of the culm, eventually penetrating and overcoming the culm so that by around 5 - 8 years depending on species and climate the culms begin to collapse and decay. This brief life means culms are ready for harvest and suitable for use in construction from 3 - 7 years.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo#Growth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo#Growth</a>",1248291027

There are employee dorms and employee cafeterias at every factory I've been to.  These things are completely self contained.  I've toured them, and they're like college dorms.  The workers stay there, in the dorms and eat there.  They're not prisoners.  Everybody goes back home, (often over a thousand miles) every year for Chinese New Year, for example.  They also leave the factory grounds in the evening, just like you'd leave a college campus you lived on to hang out downtown.<p>Now, all that said, the competition for those jobs, I think, is quite intense.  I've been repeatedly impressed by the level of dedication in the engineering staffs I've worked with.  You say you need a fixture modified to allow a certain PCB component to be tested in a different way, and they're back in 30 minutes with the changed fixture, for example.  Those engineers make things happen in minutes, not days.  It's quite motivational to be among them.  However, I'm sure there's a certain fear component that's driving them.  It's a very good job, and they don't want to lose it.  I'm not certain how such a thing can be addressed.  It's just a function of the supply and demand of factory jobs.<p>I also sense a bit of colonialism mentality in many of my fellow engineers when we travel over there.  We're smart, and they're idiots, is an attitude that is almost constant among western engineers dealing with Chinese factories.  It's your typical client/vendor bullying, but multiplied by 5 due to this attitude.  When you bully the factory manager, he'll pass that down the line, I'm sure.<p>Now, I've never worked with Apple, but I'm told it's a bit scary there.  Lot's of pressure, even for the American engineers to perform to perfection.

Most of the time, I suspect, my search results don't need data from my social network to improve.  But occasionally social data might be highly relevant.  And so if my search results are Google quality most of the time, and even better (due to social network hits) a small percentage of the time, Cuil may totally rock.<p>I also like how this isn't a social network search engine.  It's an extension of normal search.  I can't imagine myself (at least today) sending a separate query to my social networks.  But obviously I query a normal search engine all the time.<p>I wonder if they will run into Terms of Use issues with Facebook et al.  In order to search efficiently, they'll need to store social network data...",1248289413

The movie is not about stealing ideas and several people are killed.<p>The movie is about a corrupt iconic thought leader who bugs hackers' work and home lives and eventually kills them when they are no longer useful or become a threat.<p>Obviously a comment in jest, but Tim Robbins' character looks to have been based on Jobs (except for the psychopathic thing) and like many similar movies the ""jumped"" from 12 stories could be replaced with ""thrown"" for more drama.<p>Since when do we have to explain jokes to 3rd graders around here?",1248289408

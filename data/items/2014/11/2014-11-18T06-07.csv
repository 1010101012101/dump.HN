8622751,comment,8622558,8622645,0,0,Ronsenshi,,,"> I suspect that both Node and Django will be obsolete in roughly a year or two.<p>Quite a bold statement about Django, which I can&#x27;t agree with.<p>Django has bee around since 2005 - for 9 years. Longer than node.js lifespan. I don&#x27;t really see any large competitors in the web framework field that would push Django from its current position.<p>Check careers.stackoverflow.com for jobs tagged with Django - quite a lot. That shows rather strong position of the framework on the jobs market. Those jobs may not be hip or not in startups, but nevertheless - they are there.<p>Anyway. Certainly framework fading away is not something new, but I would be surprised if that would happen to Django in the next two years. Five - possible. Two - doubt it.",1416293973

This story is media hype for two reasons: (1) greed and ego of the press; and (2) greed and ego of the press. Buzzfeed looks good for breaking the story, and the comment is an existential threat to other journalists and their business models. Ego, here we are.<p>I&#x27;d be more worried about this if their were some evidence that this was a view (1) meant to be expressed in public (or actually articulated to the public); or (2) articulated in confidence internally in a professional context (which means the intent was real, not just rhetorical; or (3) if other eye-witness testimony comes forth that unequivically supports that this was an actual threat mean to intimidate those actually present (seems unlikely...but lets see).<p>Without that, this is just another internet shitstorm, manufactured by people who have something to gain financially or who are emotionally invested in maligning this individual or the company.<p>I don&#x27;t think you need to give anone the benefit of the doubt here, its more that the evidence doesn&#x27;t really support the conclusions that are implied by the reporting (at least, yet).",1416293854

So I guess we&#x27;re left to interpret whether her journalistic credentials is what  BuzzFeed is claiming to be targeted here:<p>> <i>They could, in particular, prove a particular and very specific claim about her personal life</i><p>And the last graf of BuzzFeed&#x27;s piece doesn&#x27;t entice us to give Uber&#x27;s exec the benefit of the doubt:<p>> <i>At the Waverly Inn dinner, it was suggested that a plan like the one Michael floated could become a problem for Uber. Michael responded: “Nobody would know it was us.”</i><p>I&#x27;ve worked in investigative journalism for a few years and have worked on projects that dug up things about people. But never have my colleagues nor I did such work under surreptitious means. We made our identities clear during the reporting, and we printed our findings and allegations under our own names, and we took the criticism that came toward us. As far as I can tell, Lacy operates under the same rules of the game. So again, I ask, where do you see the fair turnabout between what Lacy does as a journalist and what BuzzFeed reports to have heard from the dinner?",1416293850

While it may have been an accidental side-effect, blocking so many foreign sites has enabled a flourishing of domestic internet companies of the likes that nobody but the US has seen unless I&#x27;m mistaken.<p>And for a &quot;middle class&quot; of blocked sites, while not technically blocked, the packet delay is so great most people (except a dedicated few) will just shrug and figure that cross-continent internet connections must be too slow to be practical. Accessible, but only if you&#x27;re willing to wait a minute. A brilliant political play, because it&#x27;s hard to pin a charge oppression on anyone, since the information is technically there, but so slow nobody will access it.",1416291484

You say you aren&#x27;t defending this behavior, but you effectively are -- and it&#x27;s behavior that is among the filthiest, nastiest behavior I&#x27;ve seen in two decades in this industry. This has absolutely nothing to do with your -- or anyone&#x27;s -- &quot;concern&quot; about journalism; this is about a top executive at a top company threatening the most vile, most disgusting kind of retribution against a public critic.  The behavior is entirely indefensible and inexcusable, and Emil Michael should (and no doubt will) lose his job over it.  Kindly pick a different occasion to have a discussion about journalistic integrity; the only discussion to be had here is whether this incident is a single broken executive -- or an entirely rotten corporate culture.",1416291428

This is of course true for all dedupping and incremental backups.<p>However, bup goes one step farther and has builtin support for &quot;par2&quot; which adds error correction - in a way, it efficiently re-duplicates chunks so that whichever one (or two, or however many you decide) break, you can still recover the complete backup.",1416291333

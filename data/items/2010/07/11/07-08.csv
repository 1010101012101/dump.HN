At home on Comcast I get typically 10-20 down (regardless of speedboost or whatever they call it) and 2 or 3 up. Of course work has an SLA so in theory should have less downtime, but they have actually been not too different (an SLA really means you will get generous credits for outages, not that you won't have them!)<p>Overall I'd have to say that home wins.",1278834535

1505177,comment,1505155,1505155,0,0,binarymax,,,"I'm an American living in the UK.  And to be honest, although I loathed spectator sports in the states - I really like watching football here (not American football!).  I was trying to figure out why - and decided that it must be the advertisements.  In the states with any sport - there is about 5 minutes of action and then a 3 minute commercial slot.  The beauty of football is that they show 45 minutes of action, break for a halftime, and then show the second 45 minutes.  And its great.  You become much more invested in the game when you are not bombarded by chevy and bud every time you blink, and can appreciate the athleticism much more.<p>So to answer your question - throwing a world cup final party at my place tonight with my projector and a wall that has about 120"" screen :)",1278834083

1505174,comment,1501784,1503755,0,0,chrischen,,,"You're right, cheating is not something to live by as an absolute philosophy. But no doubt people lie or cheat often and many may get away with it.<p>> I'm looking at it closely, and I still really don't see all of these cheaters you are talking about. Do you have some examples?<p>Nope. In fact, I don't even have anecdotal evidence. But my belief is that many people will get away with one or two instances of cheating here and there. Sure cheating will catch up to people, but it does so slowly (unless you constantly cheat). Not everyone does it because they are sociopathic. Some people do it because they think the end justifies the means. And because I think a lot of people believe (or at least tolerate it) in that mantra, I think a lot of them will justify cheating to get ahead slightly (perhaps to get what they think they deserve). Plus, I'm hearing all the time about how kids at MIT and what not cheat. Do I think they will get screwed in life for doing it once in a while? No, because they probably don't believe it's a good way of life. Do I care? No. Why do I not care? Well I'd only care if I can prove that someone's cheating directly adversely affected me. Otherwise, they can do whatever they want and the natural forces of cause and effect will balance it all out. That is, if it affects someone else directly, it's up to them to decide to care or not.<p>But I absolutely agree with you that constant cheating is not sustainable. In fact, in general, any actions which might piss other people off is not sustainable and takes more effort to maintain. But I think there's a lot of people doing occasional cheating/lying, mainly justified because they believe the end justifies the means. And these instances of cheating and lying may not in the end matter because ""catching up"" takes a long time, or because whatever they did just happened to be practically justified by the end result.<p>I personally don't believe in the end justifying the means, which is why I refuse to cheat or lie. If I can't get good grades then either something is wrong with the education system or I'm retarded. I'd rather believe the former. But the last thing I'd do is to pretend there is not problem with the education system (hypothetically speaking).",1278833900

As far as I know it’s rather difficult to write code that works on both 2.3/2.4 and 3.x, since the 2to3 tool assumes a recent 2.x version.... so my understanding is that they’re phasing out one python version or so each release, with the hopes of eventually getting to a 2.6+/3.x release.<p>I don’t think they’re really “ignoring” Py3k.<p>Then again, I’m not really an expert.",1278833447

Membase is a single-package install. It is easy to get, install, configure and begin using. We consider it a failure if it takes more than five minutes to get up and running.""<p>While I appreciate ease of use and their dedication to that, if I'm looking for something to handle 500,000+ requests per second, then getting it up and running initially within 5 minutes is not something I concerned with.<p>But that's just a nit pick.

Joomla was a very fair CMS choice at the time, in particular for more static sites, when compared with Wordpress. If something didn't merit the learning curve and other headaches of Drupal (again, especially a few years back) and was more cumbersome than was possible with WP at the time, Joomla was a fair way to go about doing it. At the time I did a few projects for myself and others using it.<p>Now, though, the templating system and everything else feels rather archaic to me, and I am much quicker to just turn to Wordpress for almost any ""quick out of the box"" projects I would ever need to do -- WP just works and is so extensible and easy to use, and so easy to skin as I need it.

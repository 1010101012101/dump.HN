3247208,comment,3246259,3246843,47,0,kahawe,,,"I agree with you and there is a lot to learn from this public schmear campaign and from his very obvious failures. I am surprised how many positive replies he got on the blog, though... is this some cult?<p>First and foremost he seems to be suffering from severe reality distortion with the ""we are amongst the 1% and should be multi-millionaires"".<p>Second, this is an outrageous whining and bitching very alike to what little kids do: ""but _I_ did all my work on the project, it is allll YOUR fault and none of it is mine!"". This is business, if you really put your money where your mouth is on the ""make a way"" part then you need to STFU and reflect on what YOU did wrong. Obviously a lot, otherwise things wouldn't be so frakked up.<p>Don't compare yourself to Hannibal ever again or aspire to him unless you put your money where your mouth is. He did not lead his people from half across the world away, he was right there. He knew it is frakking impossible to lead his men unless he was RIGHT THERE.<p>> <i>All of this shit was supposed to be done weeks ago.</i><p>It sounds like he is in some leading position for this project, so it should have never gotten to this point where he is NOW complaining things weren't done weeks ago. It is his fault for letting things slip and not managing it properly so it could finish on time. It is not enough to tell people now ""here is my credit card, shut up and use it. but hey I am there for you, come ask me anytime"" if you want to manage them - and then blow them out for asking you stuff or talking to you about stuff.<p>On top of that, I understand he is not with his partners/employees but frakking around in Asia somewhere and sending them emails like that? Well guess which critical human side of a project absolutely severely suffers from not-being-with-your-team? It is communication. Email and skype are great but extremely narrow communication channels; nothing can replace being there and seeing each other every day, having a chat over coffee or sharing lunch and working together. I have made this experience first-handedly when our startup boss frakked off to some other country and barely popped in. Do not under-estimate just how much information and communication is completely lost just because you are not physically there working with those guys every day.<p>> <i>Look. I love you guys. All 3 of you are dear friends of mine, close friends of mine.</i><p>That's why you called them jokers and shifted all the blame on them and made sure to emphasis how awesome work YOU have done and how clearly everything is THEIR fault. Again, no conception or understanding of how to be a LEADER.<p>> <i>You and I both live in a world where most people we interact with are fucking jokers.</i><p>Oh you precious little snowflake... don't fool yourself, you are no better than the majority and so far you haven't done anything remotely close to what your role model(s) have done so back to trenches with you, precious little snowflake and earn your stripes.",1321527311

If that was the case, the current political system would ""work"". Instead people disagree on what the goals should be, and will change their opinion on what the goals should be if the goals the initially chose causes changes they dislike.<p>E.g. if you present proof that legalizing cannabis would have only positive effects, don't expect most people who are against it to change their mind, expect them to change their argument for why it should remain illegal.<p>Any technocratic government would necessarily need to be dictatorial and heavily oppressive - one that wasn't wouldn't stay in power for any amount of time.<p>I keep seeing this idea prop up - especially over on Reddit.

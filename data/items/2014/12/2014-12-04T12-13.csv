In fact, it may be my favorite article ever written (although &quot;What you can&#x27;t say&quot; is a close second).<p>What I&#x27;ve come to realize though is that to a certain extent, it seems futile to try and overcome tying things to our identity.  I&#x27;ve often been accused of being overly analytical in everything I do (including things like relationships, which apparently you&#x27;re not supposed to evaluate using statistics).<p>The problem is that my attempt to catch my own biases kind of drives me crazy in a way.  I already have OCD, and all of my layers of meta-analysis toward my own arguments and viewpoints just ends up exhausting me.  Add that to the fact that when I get in an &quot;unwinnable&quot; debate (you know the people; the ones who never give an inch) I just end up getting cranky and unhappy.<p>So while I do think this primitive, illogical, emotionally biased soup of a thinking machine we call a &quot;brain&quot; is far from optimal, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s much better healthwise to attempt to force it into the other extreme.",1417697978

8698995,comment,8698153,8698728,0,0,Ezku,,,"Hi, AppGyver dev here. I understand the confusion around that claim. Especially taken out of context (<a href=""http://www.appgyver.com/supersonic/ui"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appgyver.com/supersonic/ui</a>) you can read it as ridiculous hyperbole over something readily achieved with eg MVC architectures. I&#x27;ll try and explain the difference between SPAs and MPAs and why we think the latter has merit.<p>A Single Page Application will usually consist of any number of logical views handled in a single web browser view. Since the app is Javascript and HTML, everything is loaded in the same runtime environment and switching between views is actually about swapping things in and out of the DOM. We feel that this isn&#x27;t a very good approach when you&#x27;re doing mobile applications, not least because everything you do will be an approximation of the native UI capabilities. Companies like Facebook and LinkedIn have famously failed to deliver hybrid mobile apps with a good enough user experience when using the traditional SPA approach.<p>This is where an MPA architecture comes in useful. As opposed to a single runtime environment in a single web view, multiple web views can be run <i>concurrently</i> and the native layer is used for transitions between them. This is different from both SPAs and traditional server-side architectures which you could call &quot;multi-page&quot; if you squinted a little. Besides the readily felt advantage in user experience, the approach also has architectural benefits which help out in growing your app. When your Javascript runtime is working towards rendering exactly one kind of view instead of dozens, there are radically fewer possible states and thus less issues with global state leaks and the like. In short, it helps make development simpler.<p>Hope this clarifies. As a dev, I think the ability to leverage multiple concurrent web views is one of the core advantages of the platform.",1417697616

The present evidence is established formally using the language of the past. Not everyone speaks this language. Many people venture down rabbit holes that are infinitely complex, in order to find &#x27;the base&#x27; in which everything can be rested upon, in which their subjective view of the world intersects with the objective view of the world.

Many times while you are searching for it, trying to explain it, you change it.<p>There are so many ways to interpret information mentally, coherently; that I don&#x27;t feel like science has considered this as a influential component (or a component to at least consider seriously) when measuring error margins, biases, correctness, significance. People need to be educated in how maths and logics connect us mentally in a way that is unified and solid, but in another view, the world of information defines mathematics and logic, rather than math and logic supporting the base of objective measurement. But then again, I&#x27;m talking about individual people, rather than the idea of the scientific institution  as a monolithic establishment.<p>It&#x27;s a choice selection of information combined with formalization.

It is amazing how many people on HN really hate science. Diabetics are told to eat juice or candy when their blood sugar is low for a reason.<p>Yes, sugar is absolutely necessary for energy. Fat as fuel is pseudo science BS. On the other hand most people consume way more sugar than is necessary and the sugars we take when our blood sugars are low are not the best sources of sugar for a general diet and long term fuel source.<p>On the second point,<p>>>The most stable way to supply blood glucose is by eating fat<p>>That is also too slow to be of any use.&quot;<p>Fats, fiber, and protein are pretty great for fueling stabilized blood sugar since they lower the GI of carbohydrates.  While this is not good for low blood sugar, it is great for maintaining stable lower fluctuating blood sugars.  So the general advice for a healthy person to eat more fats and less carbs is overall some pretty good as advice as there is very strong evidence that it lowers risk of Type 2 diabetes.

8698917,comment,8695814,8695814,0,0,kyledrake,,,"This article really struck a chord with me. It reminds me of a lot of the issues we&#x27;ve had running Neocities (<a href=""https://neocities.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://neocities.org</a>), which gives people free space to make their own web sites.<p>When you operate an open platform on the modern web, the first thing you quickly learn is that you will end up being embroiled in a lot of random controversies you never expected to have a role in. We&#x27;ve had doxxing issues, got caught in some &quot;Gamergate-esque&quot; drama, and even had a DDoS site (using jQuery, pretty ingenious actually) put up that ended up taking down the President of Mexico&#x27;s web site (you can&#x27;t make this stuff up). That little stunt got me a few threatening emails from, literally, the Federales (Mexican Federal Police). And of course, there&#x27;s the usual litany list of pill spam (arbitrage between other countries and US citizens who pay full price is, somewhat hilariously, one of our biggest spam problems) and whatnot.<p>The biggest epiphany I&#x27;ve had over the course of the year is on the true nature of &quot;freedom of speech&quot; on the internet. You start to learn very quickly that not all speech is free or equal. It may be under the Constitution, but if you&#x27;re a startup and a multi-million dollar corporation or university (yes, we&#x27;ve had issues with Universities too) shows up and has high-powered (and bored) lawyers to waste your time and money harassing you, it doesn&#x27;t matter if their complaint is legally valid or not. Your last resort of defense becomes public opinion. If you can&#x27;t get public support for defending someone&#x27;s freedom of speech, it doesn&#x27;t matter what the Constitution says. As Thomas Jefferson once wrote, &quot;the boisterous sea of liberty is never without a wave&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to sound dismal or depressed. Neocities has been exhausting at times, but I&#x27;m having a lot of fun. I tend gravitate to stressful startups, and (I blame this on my previous work in political activism) tend to prefer them. Neocities overall has been going very strong, and it gives me a lot of joy to check out the new sites every day and see people learning how to write HTML. It&#x27;s worth it. And I think, with knowledge and experience, the issues are manageable.<p>Tying this back to Reddit: Controversies aside, I think Reddit has done a great job over the last few years, and I want to congratulate them for the growth, and salute them for weathering the &quot;boisterous seas&quot; of being a tolerant, open platform. I don&#x27;t know Yishan Wong personally and can&#x27;t vouch for him on a personal or operational level, but I feel that Reddit has done a good job under his leadership, and I hope that people don&#x27;t unfairly pigeonhole him as a failed leader because of the difficult nature of their work. In perfect honestly, having context for some of the issues they&#x27;ve had to deal with, I may have done far worse in his position.<p>This article really makes me want to meet the Reddit team. I bet there&#x27;s a lot I could learn from them.<p>TLDR: Running an open platform is tough. Cut them some slack.",1417696249

8698896,comment,8698074,8698719,0,0,lmm,,,"> So, in order to understand a pice of code, I must: (1) know what is, or isn&#x27;t, a macro, and (2) if it is a macro, know what it does. The same applies for any function: don&#x27;t apply a function if you don&#x27;t know what it does.<p>The problem is the nonlocality. A function call can only ever have an effect at the exact point in the syntax tree where it is (side-effecting functions are bad); you can work your way up, understand each argument in isolation, then understand the function call applied to those arguments, and then you understand the value of the whole function call expression and can continue working your way up the tree. There&#x27;s no such assurance with macros, because a macro arbitrarily far up in the tree could be changing the meaning of a token many lines further down.<p>> Regarding your example, I really would like to know how typeclasses can be used to solve `(setf (car list) x)`. If you have a concrete example of what you mean, for example in Haskell, please explain.<p>I&#x27;m a Scala guy rather than Haskell. You can&#x27;t do it with language-level state, but you shouldn&#x27;t be using that anyway; lenses (inside a state monad) give you that symmetry between get and set (apologies if I mix up the syntax, there are a couple of different implementations):<p><pre><code>    (for {
      x ← list_ |-> head toState
      y = x * 2
      _ ← list_ |-> head := y
    } yield {}).run(someList)

They are two separate degrees/programs yet clearly Engineering is just the fast path to a career in Math in an industry environment.

8698877,comment,8698763,8698763,0,0,smt88,,,"Same way you get better at anything: practice!<p>Here are some additional tips:<p>1) Learning to code has a lot to do with how well you Google things and how easily you give up.<p>Needless to say, you should be great at Googling and not give up easily.<p>2) Break new things into smaller chunks.<p>If it seems like something is too hard, figure out the first step. Google it if you can&#x27;t do it yourself yet. Then move on to the next step.<p>Every program can be distilled down to very small, very simple parts that are then assembled into something more complicated. It doesn&#x27;t matter how complicated the end result is: the basic parts are still the same.<p>(Note that this always applies to web development, but not always to lower-level stuff.)<p>3) Stop using PHP.<p>It&#x27;s inconsistent, and it has these weird mashups of features from other languages that add to the confusion. It is harder to learn other languages when coming from PHP.<p>I think that Go is a great language to learn on because it&#x27;s simple, consistent, and explicit. By explicit, I mean that there isn&#x27;t a lot of &quot;magic&quot; going on underneath your code.<p>You may also want to check out Python, which has some weird &quot;gotchas&quot; (e.g. inconsistent naming of iterating functions), but is mostly a good learning language.<p>Java is the traditional beginner&#x27;s language, but that philosophy has come under fire. I still think it&#x27;s a good way to learn fundamentals, though. Java has a lot of vanilla implementations of concepts from object-oriented-programming theory.<p>3b) If you continue to use PHP, turn on strict errors when in development mode. Also use phpStorm (not free) or NetBeans (free). They understand PHP shockingly well.<p>Using a good IDE is surprisingly vital to learning and coding quickly. You&#x27;ll want to be able to CTRL+click on classes/methods/functions to go to their definitions (among many other useful shortcuts).<p>4) If using PHP, Ruby, Python, or Node, learn how to write unit tests and start writing them.<p>This is incredibly important. They&#x27;re not that fun or interesting, but you <i>need</i> to get comfortable with them. Not only do they make you much faster at finishing an app, they also make you a better programmer by forcing you to write only testable code.<p>5) Learn what the following mean and make them your religion (Google is your friend here):<p>- (Related to #4) Test-driven development<p>- &quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil.&quot;<p>- DRY (don&#x27;t repeat yourself)<p>- Principle of least astonishment<p>- &quot;You aren&#x27;t gonna need it&quot;<p>6) Always have a mission.<p>If you get up and say, &quot;I&#x27;m going to learn how to make a single-page app today,&quot; you&#x27;re not going to learn it. You need to have a real, finished product in mind.<p>That&#x27;s what professional coding is (plus getting paid), so that&#x27;s what you should practice. Many of the philosophies I mentioned above actually require knowing what you want to accomplish.<p>So as you go through your life, think of apps you want to create and write down your ideas. Don&#x27;t remove ideas because they&#x27;re hard -- remove them because you&#x27;re not interested in them anymore.<p>7) Look around at different APIs.<p>There are a ton, and you can mash them up in really interesting ways. There are APIs for payments, text/video/instant/audio messaging, cars, movies, maps, places, government data, weather, finance, <i>and so many more things</i>.<p>There are countless projects you could put together in a weekend that use all of these different APIs. Do it for fun or profit, but make sure you learn how HTTP APIs work! (Strict REST APIs are a fairly rare subset of HTTP APIs, but you should definitely understand REST principles, as they pop up everyhwere.)<p>8) Ask the right questions.<p>Don&#x27;t ask &quot;how do I do [x]?&quot; on Q&A sites or forums. You can just Google stuff like that. &quot;How do I write cookies in JavaScript?&quot; There are a million answers. &quot;How do I send an HTTP request in PHP?&quot; Again, a million answers.<p>If you really want to grow, take chunks of your code that are clunky or inefficient and ask people if there are better ways to write them.<p>So instead of saying, &quot;how do I do [x]?&quot;, say &quot;I&#x27;ve done [x] like this. Is there a better way to do it?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s how you learn. You&#x27;re basically turning the anonymous experts in those communities into your personal mentors.<p>9) Seriously think about taking some classes.<p>Fundamentals are important and will save you lots of time and Googling. I&#x27;d highly recommend a class on relational databases as well.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about boot camps, but if you try one out, make sure you &quot;Ask HN&quot; about it.",1417695425

We do, some times we use custom QR codes, with less CRC error checking.<p>The reason is that computer(connected to) cameras could read them much better than barcodes(which need lasers or high definition cameras). Camera sensors are so cheap now and they let you read 2D instead of 1D, so you could add much more info, with simple hardware(like not having to control the illumination environment so much).",1417694400

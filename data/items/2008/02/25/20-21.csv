123333,comment,123223,123223,0,0,drcode,,,"Yes, I've used it for years. I think it's pretty good. Here's the biggest problems with it, by my observation:<p>1. It's easy for your ""next action list"" to keep growing and growing and... until your head explodes and you fall off the system. I guess the only way to avoid this is to be ludicrously conservative about what you commit yourself to do.<p>2. You have a deadline on a project that is falling behind, so what you decide to do is postpone all your other todos and just work on this one thing for a few days. In this time, you're not really ""on the system"" and it again falls apart.<p>3. You're in a lazy period and just plain don't care about the system and it falls apart.<p>If you can avoid those three problems, it may work for you.<p>In terms of technology, I recommend you sit down with Y combinator startup appjet.com and write your own implementation- that's what I did... If you don't customize it to your own quirks it doesn't work as well, from my experience.",1203973104

The IDE is ok - it's not going to make you rave about it. The compiler time will drive you nuts (sometimes). The debugger is good. We don't really use the UI builder as it does not fit our requirements. There is a lot of programming through (m)xml.

AOP is just another, slightly more structured, form of the same thing - a structured COME FROM (see INTERCAL), if you will.

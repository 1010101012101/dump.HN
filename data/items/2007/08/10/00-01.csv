Freudianism is past its expiration date.<p>I call foul. The idea that nerds are nerds because they can't get a date - that serious math is something that the sexually satisfied wouldn't bother with - is a pernicious stereotype, and if you're gonna flirt with that argument in the 21st century then you're gonna need data. Real data, not one-shot anecdotes like the life of Paul Erdos. (I'll see your Paul Erdos and raise you the thrice-married Richard Feynman. Now it's your turn: name a celibate jazz musician.)<p>If the urge to create software comes from a sublimated sex drive, why hasn't the world ground to a halt since we installed 24-hour vending machines for free porn on every programmer's desktop?  Was reddit founded by eunuchs? How can YC possibly compete with all those live webcams and chat rooms? \n",1186707264

These sites have huge value for the owners and that's backed up by very real numbers now.<p>> ...why aren't they?<p>Likely MySpace is much more interested in strengthening their position through reinvestment than trying to extract profits this early in the game. That's responsible and good business, even if they fail at it. Why does this surprise you?\n",1186707123

41091,comment,41065,41088,0,0,benhoyt,,,"Cheers for the feedback. Good questions ... spec disagreement is one of the things we're mulling over.<p>Currently it's the pledgers (the ""clients"") who have the vote on whether the releases are any good, or whether or not they're according to spec. But we've got in mind an agreements system for spec arguments like this. For later -- for now we're going to keep a close eye on things and see how they go.",1186706964

I'm wondering what you guys have found most useful in communicating your business to potential investors, employees, and partners?<p>Obviously there's a huge difference in ratio of information to time needed to create it, but I'm wondering if I should take the time to create all three just to have them handy, or none and just birth them on demand?  Which have you found most useful internally?",1186706408
41088,comment,41065,41065,0,0,alex_c,,,"Very cool... I think I remember seeing this concept discussed on Slashdot a few years back.<p>Two of the biggest problems in software development are - the client gives incomplete or wrong requirements, or the programmer doesn't implement them correctly.  How are you going to keep everyone happy when the programmer decides the software is deliverable, but the client(s) disagree?",1186706389

41086,comment,40847,41063,0,0,portLAN,,,"> to crusade AGAINST getting educated is profoundly depressing.<p>That's pretty much the opposite interpretation of what was intended, I think.  <p>Learning is always encouraged.  The point was not to throw away your life by joining the cookie-cutter brigade where you get molded to be like everyone else and your originality is stamped out of you so you can be a cubicle drone working for The Man (tm).\n",1186705282

41081,comment,40847,40910,0,0,portLAN,,,"If you count dropping out of college, and then attending only classes that interest you -- without being enrolled or paying -- as going to college, then sure.  Of course that model of self-directed learning is quite opposite the usual cookie-cutter process where you are told which classes to attend and how many ""units"" of them you ""need"".<p>If everyone did things Steve Jobs's way, college administrators would have heart attacks.  For the most part, going to college means jumping through the hoops they tell you to jump through, and they send you home if you don't take the prescribed courses in the prescribed timeframe and pay the prescribed fees.",1186704846

41078,comment,40955,41048,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"My original argument was neither based on revenue nor profit, but stability. I used revenue to illustrate because I didn't know the profit margin.<p>If anything, the fact that mySpace is only profitable to the tune of 1.8% strengthens my argument. Sure, they may still be in a heavy investment phase, but I honestly expected a higher margin than that.<p>>There's no reason they couldn't be making a lot more profit.<p>No kidding, but if you and I think that, why aren't they?",1186704392

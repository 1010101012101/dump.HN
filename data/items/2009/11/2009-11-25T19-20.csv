Growth in productivity is direct evidence of room for compensation to grow as well.  Therefore if wages haven't grown we need to look elsewhere than ""the workers aren't good enough to justify higher wages"" for an explanation.<p>The fact that he doesn't know basic economic facts about productivity and wages is enough that I have no interest in listening to his explanations of how to improve wages by making workers more productive.<p>I don't pretend to have anything like a full explanation for why productivity and wages are not more strongly correlated.  But it is worth noting that during the last boom wages remained steady but money spent by employers on workers grew at a healthy pace.  Unfortunately the growth in spending mostly got sucked up by higher health care premiums, so wages remained flat.<p>Unless you can fix economic trends like that one, I guarantee that the correlation between wages and productivity will remain weak.",1259178823

A good surgeon is always going to be in a decent situation, because the demand for surgeons is exactly proportional to the number of people around; a high level competitive athlete is probably much worse off as the population grows, because the number of paying athletic competitions is mostly uncorrelated to the population (though other opportunities correlate better, like teaching gym class, being a personal trainer, etc. - music is similar, in that the number of massively profitable rock stars is mostly constant, but the more mundane opportunities, like gigs and lessons, grow in line with the population).<p>Startups probably walk both sides of the line depending on the specific business plan, and I suspect that a lot of them <i>do</i> have plenty to fear from the growing pool of competent entrepreneurial programmers.  One of the issues here is that the supply of programmers is probably growing a bit faster than the population; then again, so is the need for them, especially as the world shifts more and more towards the digital, so it's possible that there's still a good balance there, I'm not sure.",1259178277

Stampi's book <i>Why We Nap</i> is out of print, my library does not have a copy, and I can't find any other references to actual studies that prove the arguments against polyphasic sleep, though the opinion of most folks does seem to be that it's not a replacement for a full nights sleep.  I just can't figure out how they <i>know</i>, rather than merely think so.  There seems to be a tremendous amount of regurgitation of party lines and mentioning of the same few, mostly dubious, sources.  I think damned near everybody involved in the conversation, including you and I, understands less about sleep than they think they do.<p>You're right, however, that there is a cult-like feeling around polyphasic sleep discussion, and I view that sort of thing with extreme skepticism...but I'm surprised to find it happening on both sides.  The ""debunkers"" are just as guilty of making unbacked claims, and poorly citing their opinions.<p>Every time I've seen a straight up assertion about how long one should sleep, whether napping can reduce the total number of hours needed, etc. I'm unable to find a study that directly backs the assertion.  I guess such studies must exist, but no one is linking to them.  Even Wikipedia is surprisingly lacking in citations of <i>directly</i> relevant scientific research on the matter.",1259176407

961620,comment,960709,961147,0,0,ewjordan,,,"<i>When gifted adolescents are compared to general high school students according to their preference for intuition, they are more likely to enjoy solving new problems and dislike doing the same thing repeatedly.</i><p>My take: they've become bored as hell, conditioned over the years of idiot level race-to-the-bottom schooling to hate doing what they're assigned the way they're supposed to do it because they don't require as much repetition as other people apparently do in order to ""get"" things.  To get any intellectual enjoyment, they had to find interesting stuff on their own.<p>I'd also suspect that the introvert part comes about mostly because of the various social stigmas against doing well in school; later in life, a lot of people that were silent outcasts in school really come out of their shells once they're around people that value skills other than throwing balls around.<p>In other words, my take is that there may be a causal relationship here, in that ""giftedness"" (whatever that really means) tends to force people towards a certain personality type in most high school environments.<p>I'd be very curious to see if these results continue to hold in cultures where there is less teaching to the bottom and more respect for academic talents.",1259176116

1069588,comment,1067423,1069476,0,0,gvb,,,"As others in this discussion have noted, there is a lot of churn in engineers at outsourcing shops, so the ""start up"" costs are forever.<p>The outsourcing engineers I have worked with have been smart, but inexperienced. [edit]  The ones I <i>didn't</i> work with were smart, <i>experienced,</i> and <i>substantially more expensive.</i><p>My gross extrapolation from my limited experience with outsourcing is that the engineers gain experience, but that experience makes them more valuable.  Since they are smart, they use the outsourcing shop experience as a springboard into a better job, probably not in the outsourcing business or in a ""higher up the food chain"" (and thus more expensive) outsourcing shop.<p>Outsourcing is like having a perpetual intern program - all the training costs but never getting the benefit of that training with a long term employee.",1264164853
1069587,comment,1066572,1069385,0,0,nova,,,"Yes you can decompose it further but it doesn't matter. Just consider that ""energy intake"" is the energy actually absorbed by your body, not what you put in your mouth. (Try eating grass. It has energy, but we can't use it)<p>My point is that a lot of people misinterpret conservation of energy assigning it a direction of causality it doesn't have. It's a constraint between variables (not an assignation as in programming languages) which are under complex feedback control systems in the body, and that's why the kind of calories you eat (fats vs carbohydrates) DOES matter, you don't eat abstract pure energy but as you say mass with chemical energy that has to be metabolized.<p>That's why starvation diets (just counting theoretical calories, which are numbers obtained in laboratories, dismissing the type of macronutrient) often fails in the long term and leave serious damage.

People here are a lot less direct and value privacy. One example: on Facebook many people write their relationship status, sometimes even the name of the person they're with. On mixi, you can't. Even in real life it's very hard to guess people's relationship status because they just never mention it, and people don't kiss/hug/touch in public. I've been in a hilarious (in retrospect) situation where I was interested in someone and confided to a good friend about it, only to learn that they had been going out together for a while!<p>Another point is that ""the group"", the people you associate yourself with, is a very important thing. I think many people would feel embarrassed if other people 'friended' them without being asked to. It's considered rude to say ""no"", but at the same time people don't want to be ""friends"" with people they wouldn't assume responsibility for (it's normal in Japan to apologize for something your brother, friend or co-worker did - the whole group is accountable).

Prohibitions against teaching, learning, and using English under Francisco Franco was Spanish Nationalism. The former is good, the latter is bad.<p>> IMHO, it is naive for individuals to assume that someone else would protect/fight for their rights.<p>The Greeks used to fight like crazy amongst themselves, for instance, the Peloponnesian Wars. There was lots of bloodshed and destruction and waste. The Greeks had a nationalistic loyalty to their particular city-state. This ended when the Persians showed up, who were orders of magnitude less appealing to the Greeks, and that did away with a lot of inter-Greek warfare and nationalism.<p>I believe the same can be said of races and religions these days. Conflict between races is like conflict between the various Greek city-states: A damn waste. We've got bigger problems to solve, and can probably work on a better level than that.<p>Thinking that black people and white people, etc, etc can look after each other might sound now like the idea of Spartans and Athenians and Macedonians all on the same side. Crazy, but when it comes to pass, we'll be better off. I understand the purpose of the nationalism, but it's got to stop at some point if we want a better world. At the very least, enemy-centric nationalism where other groups are villainized needs to stop ASAP. Bad will come of it.",1264163837

And to answer you question no I don't blame them, I would try to go somewhere that where more prosperous if I could. But just like the Indians tempers are starting to flair, it would only take a few incident to light that match and atrocities would be committed on both sides. Are the Mexicans the victims? They are the ones moving in. If the white man looses was he the peaceful victim?<p>The reason I being up the Mexicans is because we see this occurrence happen through history and it usually ends up in a violent confrontation that both parties excite. The Indians and white settlers are no exception to the same occurrences we see in modern history. If you think the Indians where sitting around baking bread and then all of the sudden for no reason whitey started killing them then you have a very warped sense of revisionist history.<p>Just read the story of Daniel Boone's son and how they butchered (and when I say butchered I mean butchered) him and it will give you some perspective as to why the pilgrims started to war with the Indians. I mean everyone wants to make whitey the baby killers and here we are with documented accounts of multiple occasions of Indians butchering men's entire families (even the little babies) as revenge and intimidation tactics.<p>I we did the same to some illegal Mexicans you could be sure that they would want revenge for such atrocities. And once a populist attitude of indiference ot another race or culture has set in it is verry hard to reverse course, whch eventual leads to the total destruction of one of the two cometing cultures.<p>Israel and the middle east is a good example of this unrepentant attitude.

It is as it is, human nature is as it is and you just have to accept it, until you and others do you are doing everyone a disservice, as solutions need to be derived from real problems and not once idea of what the problem should have been.

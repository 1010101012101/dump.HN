There were four votes for a rule putting software and business methods outside patentability in Diehr (450 U.S. 175 (1981)) and again in Bilsky (561 U.S. ? (2010)). If Obama gets a chance to replace one of the pro-software patent justices (Roberts, Alito, Kennedy, Thomas, Scalia), the result could be different next time.<p>Note that in both those cases, the justices that were skeptical of software patents were those typically classified as the &quot;left&quot;-wing justices. I have no idea why that happens. Dr. Lessig had a theory in Eldred v. Ashcroft that he could win over &quot;right&quot;-wing justices for textual literalist copyright reform but it was only the &quot;left&quot; justices that finally agreed with reason in that case; even then it was only the most avid patent reformers he won over: Stevens and Breyer.",1374289079

6074151,comment,6072524,6073838,6,0,dkarl,,,"I think that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re headed.  Theaters are learning to appeal to distinct audiences.  The Alamo Drafthouse, for example, takes pride in kicking out noisy people, and they don&#x27;t allow children at most screenings.  They also have special screenings where infants and children are welcome, so they&#x27;re already specializing for more than one audience.  Some theaters achieve a similar specialization through their location and their programming.  In the long run, I don&#x27;t think the commodification of blockbusters will kill movies for the minority who want something different, any more than McDonald&#x27;s makes it hard to find great food.  Formulaic, standardized mediocrity will be a choice.  A popular one, to the frustration and grief of progressive people everywhere, but still a choice that can be declined by those who prefer something else.  And the internet will come to the rescue of those poor souls who in the past would have been limited to whatever showed up at their local two-screen theater.<p>There may be a couple of drawbacks to this future, though.  It may mean that big franchises like Star Trek and Superman are doomed to be mutilated on this 15-beat bed of Procrustes, because a producer who intends to produce an industry-standard movie to tight tolerances can outbid anybody who wants to do something creative with it.  And it may mean that most &quot;mainstream&quot; theaters give up on the idea of watching a movie quietly in the dark, simply because they don&#x27;t have the will or the means to enforce it.  I can see movie theaters turning up the lights a little bit, moving the concessions into the theaters, and changing the seating to make it easier for people to move around like they&#x27;re in a club.  I think the outcry against that would be a big screaming silence, because people who don&#x27;t like hearing teenagers talking on their cell phones or noisily sucking face have already stopped going to big cineplexes, at least in places where there&#x27;s an alternative.  I call it a drawback only because I&#x27;d hate to see most of the country deprived (via price or distance) of the experience of being immersed in the big screen and transported for an hour or two into a movie, even a bad one.  But there may be enough demand for such an experience to keep &quot;quiet&quot; theaters running even in small cities.",1374288481

Identify what you are worth to the customer, prove it, then charge based on that. In the book Nagle, Hogan and Zale give examples of quite dramatic price changes where the customer agreed with the reassessment of value. The sellers could prove that a new product would quintuple productivity, so asking for a doubled price was damn near an act of charity, not highway robbery.<p>Also useful was their treatment of calculating the cash effect of pricing changes.

The fusion of legislature and executive means that the executive must be exposed to the view of Parliament at all times. The fusion also means that governments usually form quickly and so can govern with some confidence of expeditiousness (vs endless hearings), while bicameralism provides an inbuilt mechanism of resistance and review.<p>Meanwhile, Americans think the President is some kind of God-king.

This isn&#x27;t a new idea, it&#x27;s been heavily criticized since Bush has been in power and expanded the use of it:<p>> Glenn Greenwald alleges that the Bush administration attempted to expand executive power, as evidenced by the unitary executive theory propagated by John Yoo. The theory suggests that the President, as Commander-in-Chief, cannot be bound by Congress or any law, national or international. By invoking the state secrets privilege in cases involving actions taken in the war on terror (i.e. extraordinary rendition, allegations of torture, allegedly violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) Greenwald opines the administration tried to evade judicial review of these claims of exceptional war powers. In effect, this is preventing a judicial ruling determining whether there is a legal basis for such expansive executive power. With that in mind, applying this privilege makes impeachment the only possible means left for Congress to exercise their duty to uphold the checks and balances constitutionally intended to prevent abuse of power.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege</a><p>Since impeachment is a highly unlikely scenario... if a government action is unconstitutional and citizens have a no way of challenging the constitutionality in court due to the <i>government</i> deeming it&#x27;s actions were a secret, then how is the government <i>not</i> deciding what is considered constitutional or not?",1374287202

I thought you might have meant that Clojure lists were automatically serialized to stable storage on, for example, program exit.  Lisp lists have always been persistent, then, except when you mutate them? Because you can make your (f o o 1 b a r) from (f o o b a r) without copying the whole thing in any Lisp.<p>Lots of Lisps have been backwards-incompatible with previous Lisps.  Scheme, Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, and even MACLISP and LISP 1.5 were all significantly backwards-incompatible with their predecessors.  That didn&#x27;t make them non-Lisp.

Is there any precedent for a patent case successfully blocking a business whose service is all on a website?  If so, what happened?  Did they simply take over the domain?  What if a business used a foreign owned domain?<p>I feel like there are options here that may not have been tried.  Presumably a patent troll could try to tell your payment service and US based servers not to do business with you, but I haven&#x27;t heard of that either, aside from credit card companies blocking Wikileaks and the US govt seizing servers suspected of hosting illegal stuff.  I forgot why the US govt seized servers in VA a few years back but the point is that is pretty unusual too and I wonder how far a patent troll would go or how difficult it would be for them to get through all that.<p>The only way China blocks Facebook, for example, is through a massive firewall, and their businesses generally don&#x27;t accept any foreign credit cards.  The US seems unlikely to put in a huge firewall or modify DNSs to go after small businesses for patent trolls..",1374286203

What can we do with it? For instance, one procedure to this statement might be that:<p><pre><code>    &quot;I use Facebook to stay current with my closed family and friends. My grandmother is quite old.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>    &quot;I use Facebook sparingly to keep minimal communications on a widely used platform.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>    &quot;I use Facebook because my company has no minimal messaging portal.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>    &quot;I use Facebook because my type of work is in the business of social networking, and Andressen tells us it&#x27;s all about computers.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>    &quot;I do not use Facebook.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nNow this one is curious, since it does not immediately suggest that Facebook is even used in a sense of &quot;mention&quot;  la Korzybskian (Alfred Korzybski) sentences.

But the statement does not merely contingently re-use Facebook in a dual sense, but necessarily so, in the following way:<p><pre><code>    &quot;I might not have ever used Facebook.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nHere we find that &quot;Facebook&quot; is used in only one sense, a material one which merely refers to it, namely &quot;Facebook.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s quite simple.

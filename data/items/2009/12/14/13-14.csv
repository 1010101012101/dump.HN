He's talking about writing then down in your tests, e.g.<p><pre><code>    ?FORALL(N,int(),\n    ?FORALL(M,int(),\n      N+M==M+N)).\n</code></pre>\nIn Haskell you can specify the `int()`'s in the type instead of in the code. What I think Hughes is saying is that for real world testing scenarios, the standard type generators aren't fine grained enough. For example, you need to specify `positiveint()`, or `elementinlist(L)`.",1260799133

Yes.<p>Github and SF represent two wholly different development paradigms: SF (mostly) represents the central way for doing development where a central repository contains the officially blessed code and additions are done by sending patches to maintainers when then go ahead and igno^H apply them.<p>github is based on forking and moving patches around in a more fluid manner.<p>Due to how the traditional systems (CVS, SVN) work, finding contributors on SF would actually be very hard because the traditional systems don't discern between author and commiter: If I send a patch to awesome-project to a maintainer, they would commit it in their name and it would be impossible to automatically determine my initial ownership.<p>If I fork awesome-project on github, create a patch and make them pull (or cherry-pick or whatever) from my repository, git will track them as commiter and myself as author.<p>This is probably another reason why, on the original article, ruby projects seem to have so many more contributors: Some of the older non-ruby projects on github are mirrors of the projects main SVN repository, thus losing all author information on patches coming from external contributors.<p>One must be careful to really be comparing apples to apples here, but still, in light of these inherent limitations, the article was very interesting.",1260799032

If you ever need a quick estimate of the quality of a codebase, this is what you should look at first. If you ever have to work on a project with poor code quality, fix the superficial issues first. Ugly code will obscure deeper architectural issues, increase defect rates, make code review hell, and make the project hard to refactor. This is advice so basic that it usually does not need to be given - good coders understand the importance of superficial beauty at such a deep instinctive level that they will feel compelled to fix cleanliness and neatness issues before working on deeper problems.""",1260798708

I started keeping a notebook of helpful tricks back in the 90s. By the mid-90s I was publishing some of the info, and by the late 90s I had friends working with me to create articles. This was when the e-Zine was still pseudo-popular as a channel of self-publishing. We later went on to blog format, but the results are the same:<p>Your brain forgets little, but loses references to information it hasn't needed to use in a while. Documenting things (which includes proofreading and maybe even testing your documentation), uses repetition to solidify those references. Some people learn by repetition better than others, but even if it's just penciling apache config tips or iptables examples into a Moleskine journal, writing is often one of the best ways to memorize things.<p>The things I've written down are the things I remember best or at least they're the things I find easiest to come back to. It goes for the awk recipes I've jotted down, database tuning parameters, and even automotive repair tips.",1260796344

I understood that the code in the page (the src built by the coder) was not going to be compromised. I should have realized that the browser would treat data loaded through an img src tag differently than it would data loaded through a script src tag.<p>Some versions of IE can be fooled into executing JavaScript contained in an image file, but the image has to be loaded on its own (in an iframe or a new window), so it wouldn't apply to my original comment.

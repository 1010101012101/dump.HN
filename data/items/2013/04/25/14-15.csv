Aside from what appear to be gratuitous swipes at ""value"" and ""user stories"", a halfhearted attempt to propose new jargon (except that the terms aren't defined, each just has some vague statements made about it), and a claim that this somehow increases the organizational value of the PMO, this seems to be exactly how most works on agile or lean methods I've ever seen have suggested that work items (whether they are called ""user stories"", as is common in many agile approaches, or not) are generated.

It's directly linked to free and bound type variables and yes, it's complicated to understand.<p>If you look at the [Abs] rule, you will see in the premise ""x : tau"". Here, by definition, tau is non qualified. It represents a unique type. It's necessary monomorphic. Concretely, it means x will be bound to a type variable in the type environment and this type variable will uniquely be unified.<p>On the other hand, the premise for [Let] is e0 : sigma, x : sigma. Contrary to tau, sigma is qualified (polymorphic). So, it can be unified to a different type variable in different expressions.<p>I completely understand why it fails you. The way qualifier affects the unification process is quite complicated. I finally understood it only after having to write my own rules when I was implementing a type checker for my master thesis.<p>If you don't mind the formalism, read carefully the Wikipedia article paying particular attention to how tau and sigma are defined and to the paragraph about free and bound type variables.

Houses in cold climates usually use more efficient heating systems, so the heat from a light bulb will be pretty costly by comparison. With a 50W savings, the cost for additional heating to make up for that will probably only be equivalent to about 10W of electricity, or less, depending on your setup.<p>Air conditioning is usually pretty efficient, with efficiencies better than 10 (10W of heat removed for 1W of electricity used).

Firstly, SSL and whatever certification system used in the future will still exist to prevent man-in-the-middle hijacking, meaning even if trivial to do (like defacing Wikipedia), I do not think it will occur substantially unless as a form of DDoS (as in defacing Wikipedia), and second... by implementing something like the possibility of manual pinning and upstream authority/record-source blacklisting (a common technique in P2P apps, with an anology in Wikipedia to marking a page/record ""frozen"" for a period due to contention), it would be possible to preserve consensus, overriding/responding to the current level of state censorship for the forseeable future. If governments more broadly dictate filters, that will change the nature of things (and of Wikipedia... They will be able to change history), but we are not there yet nor do I think we will be there on the order of 5-10 years (and something like this might slow that timeframe).

While modules and functors are quite cool, I think typeclasses end up being more practical. Standard ML gets a lot of little things right that I think OCaml gets flat out wrong (mutable strings, throwing exceptions instead of returning 'a option), but Haskell seems to take it further, with a standard library that I can only describe as very <i>tasteful</i>. This is just my impression after reading half of Real World Haskell and doing a lot of dabbling but not a lot of real work, so I'm sure it's incomplete.<p>Haskell's syntax <i>IS</i> nicer than Standard ML's and OCaml's, but that is the least important thing IMHO. If there were an ML (strict, impure) with typeclasses and with as taseful design as Haskell at the edges, I would probably use that over Haskell, even if the syntax was ugly(ier). As it stands, I'm inclined to eventually switch to using Haskell, and just figure out how to deal with the other bits of it (laziness, purity), just so I can use typeclasses and the well-designed bits.<p>[0] In case you doubt how much ML I've written, the repo is on GitHub",1366901042

That's over 90 straight days of 110F temperatures last year.<p>It's a new, pretty efficient HVAC unit though. Thankfully. First home I've had that didn't struggle to maintain 76F indoors during the hottest part of the day.<p>Still, there's not a ton you can do around the house as cheap as replacing the bulbs in the high-traffic areas. Anybody can do that. Replacing your HVAC for something more efficient is going to be a challenge for most.<p>Then there's high-R-value windows to install. Foam insulation on exterior walls (brick, so that's a lot of dry-wall work). Radiant barriers in the attic space. More ceiling insulation. Tankless water heaters.<p>Outside of maintaining your weather stripping, I can't think of anything that pays off as much, for as little, than replacing your light bulbs. Maybe getting a Nest thermostat? We've got recessed lighting in the Living Room, which had four big 90W halogen bulbs when we moved in, and are almost always on if somebody's home. Replaced 'em with 17W LED bulbs (<a href=""http://www.usa.philips.com/c/led-light-bulbs/ambientled-17w-par38-soft-white-dimmable-046677418434/prd/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usa.philips.com/c/led-light-bulbs/ambientled-17w-...</a>).<p>That comes out to about $7/month in savings. (360w vs 68w @ $0.0912 per kw/hr). In the year since I installed them they've paid for themselves. They'll last 22 years according to Phillips. The ROI on LED (for your highest-traffic rooms at least) is stupid cool, and I'll effectively never have to bust out the 8' ladder to replace them. I might be off base, but I think I've typically replaced halogens every couple years or so. So even over 5 years the old bulbs probably would've cost me 10X more.<p>For our situation at least, that's a no brainer. If I can spend $50 today and avoid paying $5/month indefinitely, that's a big win in my book. I may not be able to afford to buy a car cash, and have to pay the financing penalty, but at least I can break out of the ""financing"" cycle with my home lighting. ;-)",1366900764

Very unprofessional and reaching to establish a certain narrative. Sharing one end of overheard private converstions? Conjecture and opinions about Mr. Sherman? You are the controller.

Because the laser pulse is very briefon the order of nanosecondsthe intensity is high enough to break molecules of oxygen into their constituent atoms over a few millimeters in the thin midsection of the hourglass. This happens so rapidly during the pulse that the same pulse subsequently excites many of the oxygen atoms into a high-energy state, creating what's called a population inversion. This unstable condition then leads to the familiar laser chain reaction in which an excited atom drops to a lower energy state, emitting a photon of a particular wavelength, and that photon in turn stimulates another excited atom to emit a photon of the same wavelength and phase.</i><p>The thus excited region of space emits two laser beams, one in the direction of the original ""trigger"" beams, and one <i>in the opposite direction</i> i.e. back at the source. The intensity is said to be around 1,000,000 times that of the ambient radiation in that wavelength, so it's ""easy"" to detect. And the beam carries information about the molecular mix in the generating volume of space, which is of course the core feature here.<p>That is ... pretty close to being magic, in that ""naah, that can't be possible!"" way that is so fantastically neat.<p>Too bad the triggering impulse (heh) to develop this is something as nasty as land mines and IEDs, the technology itself is just beautiful.",1366898874

I am just now starting to apply my programming skills to education problems.<p>At PyCon 2012, pg asked developers to fix search, email, and universities.  When someone asked him about fixing public US high schools, he said something along the lines of ""Don't try to do that, it's too hard."" He really meant that it's too hard to base a profitable startup on fixing public high schools.  He was not against efforts to improve public education.<p>No one will ""fix"" public education, just like no one will ""fix"" email.  The only approach to large problems like this is to create something that helps people solve the core problem in a better way.  Then take over ""market share"".<p>I believe public education is ripe for a revolution. The revolution won't happen by entering the political arena with a loud voice.  It will happen by educating a statistically normal group of students in a way that can easily be scaled.<p>I believe that ""easily scaled"" means every tool involved in the process needs to be completely free and open.  There is so much friction in education, that we need to make adoption of better methods as easy as registering a new account on a website.<p>I am working on a simple trio of open tools that I believe has the capability of bringing about widespread change.  Briefly:<p>OpenCompetencies: A tool that allows a school to manage its own system of standards/ learning targets.  One school's system can be ""forked"" by any other school, at any time. The concept of forking is clear to us, but does not exist in public education. OpenCompetencies also identifies ""pathways"", which are paths through the entire set of standards, focusing on particular post-high-school interests.<p>OpenCurriculumBuilder: A dedicated lesson-planning tool.  Most lesson plans are still written in Word, which is like programming with an old version of notepad.  This tool lets teachers focus on the intellectually interesting parts of lesson planning.  It supports sharing by creating a common format for curriculum plans.  It supports long-term revision by separating data from presentation.<p>OpenStudentTracker: This is a tool to import all the competencies from OpenCompetencies, creating a personal ""map"" for a student's learning.  When a student completes their map, they are finished with high school.  The map can be owned by the student, or a parent or school on the student's behalf.<p>I gave a lightning talk at PyCon this year about these tools, which was well-received.

8873201,comment,8870481,8871620,0,0,_delirium,,,"> There are a handful of good alternatives. Use one. Use multiple.<p>For search at least, unfortunately, the alternatives are pretty questionable. I&#x27;ve been using DuckDuckGo experimentally for a few months now, which is mostly Bing as the backend, with some DDG-specific add-ons and tweaks. I find myself having to use the !g command to rerun the search in Google somewhere around 40% of the time. Some of this is site owners causing the problem: a surprising number of sites block all crawlers in robots.txt, but then whitelist Googlebot and only Googlebot. But even leaving aside those sites, DDG seems to miss a lot of results, and the quality of the first-page results, at least for how I search, is consistently lower.<p>If you try searching in a language other than English the differences are even larger. I suspect that&#x27;s because some of the infrastructure and datasets used for Google Translate are also used by search in some form, while Bing doesn&#x27;t have a similarly solid multilingual stack.<p>I&#x27;d like to see more competition in search, but the barrier to entry to produce a good full-web search engine seems quite high.",1421059531

8873197,comment,8873062,8873062,0,0,marktangotango,,,"The author presents a decent overview of some of the issues related to source code static analysis from a parsing perspective, but makes a pretty weak argument that parser generators are useless for the task.<p>Static analysis is a broad term, compilers generally do static analysis as part of many optimizations.  Here I think the author is referring to static analysis used in areas such as program verification (ie security).<p>Usually if one is implementing an application to provide static analysis services, one would like to support as many languages as possible, broadening the accessible market.<p>Ultimately, such static analysis needs to end up with an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the program when machine code is emitted. This can be a very complex task for some languages:<p>1. C/C++ the source code should be preprocessed, with all includes resolved identically to the system being analyzed. Processing alters the source file from what the user sees, making relating error message to source location much more involved.<p>2. Templated source files ie php, asp, jsp, ...  the templated text has no relavance to the meaning of the program.<p>There are two problems the author states with parser generators that I agree with:<p>1. Lack of facilities to relate parsing error messages to relevant offsets in the source file. Users expect relevant error messages.<p>2. The curiosity that the most current language parsers are implemented in that language (C# Rosalyn, Java comiler api).  Antlr is the exception among parser generators in that there is a large corpus of grammars for a variety of languages. Usually they&#x27;re out of date with the latest language spec (C#).

Scheme took CL&#x27;s numeric capabilities (see the Scheme Report from 1985 - CL was under development from 81/82 onwards with CLtL1 published in 1984) and then developed new ideas...

I came across this quite early in my programming career when writing a very basic http service (it&#x27;s not that long ago, I&#x27;ve been programming for about 10 years) and the first thing you learn are that your HTTP response will usually have headers, a body, and a status code.<p>In my experience, though, when working as a front end developer I&#x27;ve had to deal with developers (mostly in the .Net camp) who will gladly return errors with 200 OK and an xml/json object with the typical &quot;StatusCode: xxx&quot;, where XXX is some made up error code that you&#x27;ll need to reference in their application.<p>I believe this is because many backend developers are in web development by accident, and don&#x27;t really care much about the web as a platform.",1421057237

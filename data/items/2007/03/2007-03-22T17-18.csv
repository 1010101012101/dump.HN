It is hard for people who are in non-tech areas (or at least, non-startup-friendly areas) or middle-tier public universities to meet people to start companies with.<p>Personally, I have been trying to get picked up by a startup so I have an excuse and a means to move to a better area. How would others here recommend meeting people?",1174586336

5733,comment,5666,5666,0,0,prakster,,,"In Nov 2006, Seth Godin addressed the concept behind this issue quite elegantly (I am paraphrasing the relevant points below; the direct link is at the end of this post):<p> --Don't do a deal where each side gets a fixed percentage. A 50/50 split of a company invented in a bar is always a bad idea. Even paying someone 5% for some sort of contribution can come back to haunt you. INSTEAD, BUILD THE DEAL AROUND A SHIFTING PERCENTAGE BASED ON CONTRIBUTIONS OVER TIME.<p> --Don't assume that the money you start with is going to be enough. Let's say you and a buddy each put in $5k and each take half the business. Then what? What happens when the money runs out and only one of you is willing to put in the next block of capital?<p> --Do a deal with someone you trust, but don't do a deal with a friend. You'll likely end up with neither a partner nor a friend in the end.<p><a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/11/dont_make_a_bad.html"">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/11/dont_make_a_bad.html</a>

5727,comment,5700,5712,0,0,sethjohn,,,"That comment was intended to be read somewhat tongue in cheek, but for the sake of argument:<p>1) What's the point of having money if you aren't going to spend it and have fun? I suppose you could throw a smaller party and write a big check to the Google Philanthropy...but either way money is meant to be used.<p>2) If you actually had the skills and personality to turn $20K from YC into $3M in three months...you've clearly got entrepeneurism in the blood and shouldn't ever have trouble finding a lucrative job that you enjoy.",1174583596

5725,comment,5572,5572,0,0,nostrademons,,,"My list, categorized:<p><i>Business & Management</i><p>1. Innovator's Dilemma and Innovator's Solution by Clayton Christensen<p>2. Built to Last and Good to Great by Jim Collins.  Built to Last is more applicable for startups.<p>3. Mythical Man Month by Fred Brooks.  Anyone who has to manage a team of programmers and hasn't read this will <i>fail</i> utterly, unless they've already failed before (or been on a failing team).  There's a lot that's counterintuitive about software project management.<p>4. Peter Drucker's work.  Kinda long and repetitive, but some good insights.<p><i>Marketing</i><p>1. All Marketers are Liars by Seth Godin.  I like this better than Purple Cow, Guerilla Marketer's Handbook, and The Big Red Fez.  Most of those have fairly obvious stuff.<p>2. The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell<p>3. Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore<p><i>Technical</i><p>1. Building Scalable Websites by Cal Henderson<p>2. High Performance MySQL by Jeremy Zawodny<p>3. Pragmatic Programmer by...well, it's mentioned elsewhere here.<p>There are lots of other technical books I like, but most of them aren't directly relevant to the startup I'm building",1174583252

5722,comment,5486,5686,0,0,far33d,,,"myname: You are correct. To get a ""studio-quality"" recording, you'll need lots of expensive equipment. <p>But you've obviously missed the idea: the gap between what you can make with mediocre equipment and top-notch equipment is closing fast. In the old days, you needed good mics because analog equipment needed high quality input. With digital processing and recording, you can get close with a mic that costs $200 (which, if you had a good marketplace for borrowing/sharing equipment, you might only pay $5 for the weekend).

I notice that when I do imperative programming, I think through a sequence of steps, usually writing them down on paper if there is any complexity.

With a small amount of experience over a long period of time dealing with customer support, my observation is that most people assume passwords are stored in plain-text, and don&#x27;t even consider an alternative. At my current place of employment, we frequently get people phoning up, asking for their password; some seem a bit put-out when we explain we cannot provide it.<p>As people who know more about this, it is our responsibility to ensure those who know little, and care even less, don&#x27;t have to worry about it.

They prefaced the entire content by saying that mostly you can&#x27;t learn startups from a lecture, because the most important information you need to know is what the customer wants and it&#x27;s specific to each market. You can learn something more general about marketing and user acquisition.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve been watching the videos online.

8475097,comment,8474032,8474032,0,0,swombat,,,"> <i>And finally, here is one thing NEVER to do when asking for more money.  Never ask for it nor justify it because of your need.  If you work for a for-profit entity, as most of us do, your need is completely irrelevant.  While I can personally be hugely empathetic to your financial needs and hardships, I cannot justify increasing your compensation because of them — that is unfair to the company and to any coworker who puts in the same effort but walks away with less.</i><p>Interesting note on this... At GrantTree we&#x27;re (still in the early stages of) trying something different. Since all pay is open and we use something called the &quot;advice process&quot; to make decisions, to change their salaries people need to make an open proposal to the whole company, gather feedback, and then make a decision (note: they do not need to incorporate all or any of the feedback; we trust them to make the right decision).<p>With this in mind, the proposal is meant to cover 5 key angles:<p>1) What do I deserve?<p>2) What do I need?<p>3) What is the market rate for my role?<p>4) What can the company afford?<p>5) What is good for GrantTree?<p>We explicitly ask people to include their needs in this. They are people, they have needs - ignoring that is stupid, in my opinion. If we have someone on staff who is contributing greatly to the company but has high mortgage payments, and I pay them less because I have this other person who is contributing the same but has much lower monthly costs, and I pay the first the same as the second, I will lose the first because they can&#x27;t afford to keep this job.<p>Obviously we&#x27;re still experimenting with this (about 3 months in), but I think that considering the needs of the person is essential - particularly in a decision model where they make the decision anyway, so they will obviously be considering their own needs as part of the equation! But even if someone else was making the decision, considering the person&#x27;s needs is absolutely mandatory if you expect the person to also consider the company&#x27;s needs.<p>In other words, if you don&#x27;t care about their needs, why should they care about yours? &quot;Oh really, this has been a bad year so you don&#x27;t want to give me a pay raise even though my market rate has increased? Fuck you, I&#x27;m off.&quot;",1413629001

How to write a cello solo that sounds\nlike a compassionate girl?<p>For some more, there is the duet, &quot;Presentation\nof the Rose&quot; in <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i> with Barbara\nBonney and Anne Sophie von Otter as at<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuS337uc-4Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuS337uc-4Y</a><p>Some parts of the duet with the two voices are\njust marvelous, and I&#x27;m not understanding how\nStrauss did that.  What&#x27;s going on?  How&#x27;d he do it?<p>For more, there&#x27;s too much going on in <i>Ein\nHeldenleben</i>, but I&#x27;d be happy knowing a little\nabout what Strauss did there, even how the\ngirl, that is, the violin solo, worked, or even just\nhow Stauss made the girl so <i>comforting</i> in the\nlast section.<p>Are such issues what you have in mind as\n<i>music theory</i>?<p>How&#x27;d I get into such questions?  One night\non a radio I heard Beethoven&#x27;s 7th symphony,\nand it seemed easy to like, e.g., the dance.\nOccasionally Dad gave me some money, and I\nbought some recordings, Vivaldi through\nRachmaninoff.  Then I was a grad student\nin math at Indiana University in a dorm next\nto the music building, and a Stern protege \nput his old Italian violin under my left\nchin, gave me a lesson, and I took a violin\ncourse, starting with how to tune the thing.\nI learned the <i>music theory</i> of perfect fifths,\nthat is, three times the frequency of the lower\nopen string is the same frequency as two times\nthe frequency of the upper open string, and the beats\nbetween those two can be used to tune to perfect\nfifths.  Not long after making it in some form\nthrough much of the <i>Chaconne</i> I got too busy\nto continue on.  So, I like the music but don&#x27;t\nfully understand just why.  <i>Music theory</i>\nhas an explanation?",1413627132

8475057,comment,8471529,8472680,0,0,tkuhn,,,"Right, I guess you could define everything into a new MIME type, but I think that would be quite a weird thing to do and wouldn&#x27;t really be faithful to the idea of MIME types. This MIME type would stand for a type that nobody would be directly using for files, but it would only stand for some internal intermediate representation (I will not be able to convince people using RDF to switch to my new strange format instead of TriG or N-Quads!). And that means that there would be two MIME types involved for a single file: the actual type (such as application/rdf+xml or application/trig) and then the type for normalization and hash calculation (something like &quot;text/rdf+selfref;sorted=&quot;). I think this shows that MIME types are not a straightforward solution to the given problem and I think this justifies to introduce this new level and a new scheme for the trusty URI modules (e.g. &quot;RA&quot;).",1413627020

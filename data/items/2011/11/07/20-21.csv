On-screen ads, if they are small enough, aren't annoying and sometimes they are useful too.  There will be some interesting dynamics regarding how ad money is distributed among all the api backends.<p>But if voice response is used a lot, then ads(in the audio) will be sufficiently annoying for many people to switch to paying the equivalent small amount every month for ad-free services (which will have to be be distributed to the backend providers using micropayments). If this kind of service works out, then the mechanism exists for getting rid of the on-screen ads too, whether or not people actually use it.  I wonder how much a the ad-value for a typical user is every month. A very rough calculation 30 billion in google's revenue/(say 200 million users * 12 months) gives 12.5 dollars/month. I think this should be an upper bound on the average, and that there will be a large variance - users who consume drugs will have larger value for advertisers, for instance.",1320699370

3208098,comment,3207966,3207966,1,0,dsr_,,,"AFAICT, most recruiters are essentially independent matchmakers. That is, they aren't working for the employer and they aren't working for the employee: they're trying to reach out in both directions and bring people together.<p>The incentive is to cut in on a share of the new employee's income. OK, book agents and talent agents do that too. The difference is that those agents have a contract with the employee. It is in their interests to take on exactly as much work as they can handle, and to do a good job on each transaction. They're looking for repeat business in both directions -- getting jobs for their clients, and addressing the needs of employers.<p>Recruiters, on the other hand, don't have a contractual relationship with the talent. They have no incentive to do a good job for any given prospective employee, and little or no hope of repeat business.<p>Meanwhile, the same network technologies that let you tell everyone what you had for lunch today and let you look up the difference between ""deciduas"" and ""deciduous"" in half a second will let you put your resume up and tell all your friends that you're looking for a new job.<p>Facebook and Google+ don't have employment features yet, but it's more or less certain that they'll be after LinkedIn's lunch in the next year or so.",1320699307

3208071,comment,3206138,3207808,3,0,tptacek,,,"The ""Innovator's Dilemma"" describes the common scenario where the successor to an incumbent product is, when it's introduce, inferior to the incumbent on important axes; for instance, it could have inadequate storage, or be too slow, or not be secure. But the new product has attributes that make it way more attractive to some new market; for instance, maybe it's game-changingly cheap, or portable.<p>As a result, the new product won't be adopted by the core market for the incumbent product. It's used by a different market, or at the margins.<p>The ""dilemma"" here is, over the long term, the new product improves as it captures more and more market share. The new product has room to evolve and isn't locked into a core market with fixed expectations. Eventually, the benefits of the new product exceed those of the incumbent product, even for the incumbent's core market, and the incumbent product loses.<p>This all plays out in slow motion, so that even if the incumbent sees this happening, they can't do much, because they're dependent on the revenue from their core market.<p>Put fossil fuel in the ""incumbent"" box, ""solar"" in the ""new product"" box, ""the industrialized west"" in the ""core market"" box, and ""the developing world"" in ""the new market"" box.",1320698959

The design is not consistent with Apple UI guidelines, I can't tell the three options are buttons.<p>2) The cancel button on the welcome dialog looks like an odd man out. It's just floating there in the center, and I think the caption (cancel) is also something you can improve.<p>3) I think the now-playing thing in the sidebar needs to be pushed down by ~60 pixels, basically starting under the main bar across the rest of the screen. It's not very symmetric the way it is now. You should also have a divider between the close buttons and the now playing section - see Chrome.app for a good example of doing it smoothly.<p>4) Playlists: now change when I hover over the entries, I was expecting them to go blue. Clicking on them has no effect, I must double-click. non-intuitive.<p>5) I love the statistics and charts in History, but I wonder if the name is accurate? I'm seeing a breakdown of my music collection, but the only ""true"" history tab is ""Recently Played"" which is also given the least prominence.<p>6) When starting the app, the whitespace stretching from under the now playing section to the bottom of the screen in the sidebar is jarring. It doesn't look nice empty, I'm assuming something will show up there at some point in my playing around with it.<p>7) Playlists uses an entirely different UI from Library. I like Library's detail view drilldown. I think something like that should be used for the playlists too. See point #4.<p>That's all for now. May update later with more feedback.<p>Good work. It looks very promising. I love that it's fast and not-bloated.<p>EDIT:<p>No way to turn off Growl messages? Oops.<p>EDIT:<p>Add Playlist -> then press esc. The playlist gets added anyway with the default name.<p>Playlist list needs right-click functionality, even if it's the same menu that shows up when clicking the cog. Don't disappoint your users expectations as to how an interface will act.<p>EDIT:<p>Playlist tab's ""Add Playlist"" pretends to be a tab but it's actually a button. Very confusing. Don't do that - buttons are buttons, tabs are tabs. Even if they're right-aligned.<p>EDIT:<p>I think you have a bug when you turn on repeat and shuffle in the middle of a song.

Another node will become the new master. Issue some more writes to make sure the logs of the new and the old master diverge. Now bring back the old master, which will become a secondary, and it will say something along the lines of ""finding common oplog point"", and it will discard the writes that it had that were not copied to the other nodes before it was killed.<p>You can verify all this by looking at the i's that were acknowledged by the old master and printed by the client. The last couple of them will be gone for good.<p>If this is unacceptable to you, then you can run MongoDB with W=majority mode, but with MongoDB W>=2 modes (so-called consistent replication modes) are very slow.",1320698439

There is practically zero integration at a platform level and any integration that is done is ad-hoc and custom.<p>If I were advising Obama, et al, I would Incentivise (with a capital I) data interchange over any specific data format or platform. Do not pick winners and losers, in my opinion it is kind of un-American. Let everyone have a fair shake in the market but encourage them to open their systems to integration from third parties through open read/write (bidirectional) api's. This would go a long way to getting new innovative systems into institutions with entrenched legacy systems.<p>Speaking to integration costs, point 2, I could not agree more. Working at any institution other than a small sized private practice requires an untold amount of training, education and ongoing maintenance to get the users to use any system of even minimal complexity.<p>""Wishlist"" 1, again spot on. Doctors do not monitor vitals in real time. They just do not have the time, nor is it pertinent to quality of care. What doctors do want are <i>intelligent</i> alerts.

1078315,comment,1077619,1077696,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"Just for a point of clarity, I was merely making the argument that both Apple and IBM have figured out how to leverage open source in their respective business models in a coherent way. I'm not necessarily claiming that either of them are religious, RMS-style open source boosters. They each have figured out ways they can use open source to benefit their bottom line.<p>IBM is basically a services company for the most part. The more they can do to reduce the amount of money a customer is paying in software licensing (sometimes to other companies), the more they can charge for their own services on a project. It is to their benefit for there to be as much free (as in beer) software out there as possible so a higher percentage of a project's overall budget goes to IBM.<p>Apple is primarily a hardware company. It is in their interest to make use of whatever community software is out there so that they don't have to re-invent the wheel for everything. They look to open source software as a way to augment what they can do internally without having to acquire tons of software companies just to get basic software technology in-house. This frees up cash for hardware R&D and aquisitions (PA Semi, Fingerworks, etc...).<p>Sun has suffered from an identity crisis in recent years. Were they a software company? A hardware company? Both? They don't appear to have been able to answer that question themselves. It's hard to have an open source strategy (or any other kind of strategy for that matter) when you don't even know what business you're in.",1264529577

There's a need for a trusted reference -- a friend's suggestion, a review piques your interest, whatever. So just setting up a domain for people who like that genre isn't necessarily going to go far. Most of the music would probably be crap, and not worth my time -- hence that need for reference. I won't assume that a domain name means good music, but I do, for instance, take Anji Bee's (<a href=""http://www.anjibee.com/category/podcast/chillcast/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anjibee.com/category/podcast/chillcast/</a>) suggestions because she has a proven track record of finding and playing excellent chill.",1264529343

I focus on <i>fitness</i>, and on body composition.<p>The sections of the article referencing article fail to distinguish <i>at all</i> between cardio and strength training. There's no mention of ""strength"" or ""weight training"" at all.<p>Your burlesque dancing is probably great cardio, and may do something for basic leg and core strength (you've probably got great adductors).  You've probably got better rythm and prioprioception than me.  And it's likely a hell of a lot of fun (not to be discounted).  But if you look into strength training principles, you'll find that in order to develop strength (or size, or endurance), you've got to train in specific modalities.  See Wikipedia for a good overview:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training</a><p><i>You won't build muscle if you don't push its limits.</i><p>Another fave for women is Stumptuous:\n<a href=""http://www.stumptuous.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stumptuous.com/</a><p>I also never said I'd given up on cardio.  These days it's more often rowing (indoors and out), and I manage a 2k indoor erg time that has me top-25 ranked worldwide (no, I haven't entered) for my age range (I've got a few on you, and sing the praises of healthy living as well). Remember: I'm coming at this from the perspective of a life-long cardio junkie and heavy-iron disdainer.<p>tl;dr:  It's diet, strength, cardio (HIIT, LSD, NEPA), <i>and</i> other fitness modalities. Don't emphasize one modality to the exception of all others.",1325113197

As I wrote a couple of years ago [1], we're getting to a point where many sites actually have obfuscated source, as there's much more attention paid to perfromance optimisations. View Source is becoming a thing of the past, at least as far as high-scale production sites go.<p>While you can still inspect the DOM and so on, but it's not as accessible if the source isn't there. So in fact, open source code on GitHub and so on is the best hope for learning and reusing, but that puts JavaScript in the same basket as every other language.<p>1. <a href=""http://ajaxian.com/archives/the-end-of-days-for-view-source"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajaxian.com/archives/the-end-of-days-for-view-source</a>",1325113134

You might be or there might be some other factors at play.  I don't know.<p>What I do know is that no one gains 25 lbs of lean muscle mass in less than month.<p>What if I said that I ran 50 MPH over a one mile span?  You'd probably say, ""Not likely.  No human has ever done that.  If you can, you need to let people know because it would be a huge breakthrough in human athletics.""  Likewise, gaining 25 lbs of lean muscle mass in less than a month is unheard of.<p>As noted by another poster -- there's a story of someone who gained about 12# in a month and that story bordered on being so unbelievable that the author of the story has to continously inform the reader that this really happened.  You're saying you did more than double that in less time.<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  With that said, you have nothing to prove to me.  I'm just saying that I don't think what you said is credible and I don't think I'm alone.  If you are being sincere, I hope at the very least, you can appreciate how hard your claim is to believe.",1325113102

3401777,comment,3400449,3400449,3,0,Tycho,,,"Somewhat ironically, the way mobile computing is obsessed with simple 'apps' reminds me somewhat of the 'Unix philosophy' - lots of tools that do one thing, which you can chain/pipe together into workflows to great effect. I can see this taking off more if vendors and developers work more on simple 'piping' APIs. And other things like RDFs, Service-Oriented Architecture in general.<p>And it could be so much more richer than the usual piping of text that happens in Unix. Imagine, you take a picture with your camera phone; you pipe the image to some sort of visual pattern matching program which isolates the faces in the picture; which are then uploaded to an online facial recognition service and the identities sent back to you; which are piped to a social networking app to find which people list polka as an interest; and then finally to your email/messaging program of choice so you can invite them to your monthly polka event. THEN you can save this workflow and have it execute from just a single camera shot... or have the camera input come from a surveillance camera via bluetooth.",1325112884

3401743,comment,3400508,3401449,0,0,egypturnash,,,"I think you're misreading the article. Especially:<p>> There is no consistent pattern to how people in the registry lost weight — some did it on Weight Watchers, others with Jenny Craig, some by cutting carbs on the Atkins diet and a very small number lost weight through surgery. But their eating and exercise habits appear to reflect what researchers find in the lab: to lose weight and keep it off, a person must eat fewer calories and exercise far more than a person who maintains the same weight naturally. Registry members exercise about an hour or more each day — the average weight-loser puts in the equivalent of a four-mile daily walk, seven days a week. They get on a scale every day in order to keep their weight within a narrow range. They eat breakfast regularly. Most watch less than half as much television as the overall population. They eat the same foods and in the same patterns consistently each day and don’t “cheat” on weekends or holidays. They also appear to eat less than most people, with estimates ranging from 50 to 300 fewer daily calories.<p>The tl;dr of that? Eat less, exercise more. Eat breakfast. You're vehemently agreeing with the part where the article talks about what Really Works, and disagreeing with the parts where they basically say that a naïve approach based solely on food intake dowsn't work.<p>I will certainly agree with your general thrust of weightloss advice. I eat a lot less junk than I used to before, I shifted to a standing desk, I don't live with depressed people who drive me crazy to be around. (And who kept TONS of food around. OH HEY I'M DOWN AND THE FRIDGE IS FULL OF ICE CREAM.) I spend at least a couple hours a week doing a workout. I get enough sleep. My doctor made me cut salt out of my diet, which basically means ""no crappy fast food any more, ever"".<p>I think some of the details are what worked for YOU. My workout isn't traditional ""exercise"", it's not lifting weights, it's not aerobics. It's burlesque dance. Turns out that learning to move your body to emphasize all your jiggly bits and pose sexily is one hell of a full-body workout. Even at just two hours or so most weeks. Plus it does amazing things to your self-confidence - not just because your body looks better, but because one of the things you're trained in is how to <i>appear</i> confident, since that's sexy. I lost like thirty pounds over 4-6 months simply because I <i>liked</i> going downtown twice a week and having an hour of dance class.<p>I think the real key is not one particular KIND of exercise. It's regular, full-body exercise THAT YOU KEEP COMING BACK TO. For you, it's Pick Up Heavy Shit. For me, it's Swan Around And Jiggle My Titties. It's got the same end result: a body that's in good shape, that moves well and <i>likes</i> to move, so that we keep on doing it instead of sinking in front of the TV for hours on end.<p>(Oh yeah, and I just turned 40. I'm definitely finding myself starting to change my thinking in how I approach my body - I can't abuse it and have it bounce back any more.)<p>tl;dr: My experience of losing weight and getting fit generally agrees with you; I differ in the details.

3401739,comment,3399827,3401430,3,0,dwiel,,,"Thanks for the comment and links.  I had only ever read \n'science fiction' like Ian Banks and Charles Stross Accelerando, but never any of the 'non-fiction'.  The linked articles were interesting.<p>I understand that the risk of an AI that wants the mass of the entire solar system as its own and quickly becomes a matrioska brain.  However, I question the idea that we aren't already there.  I would argue that an augmented billionaire or better yet, a market economy compares to someone in the poorest 5% of the world just like a modern human compares to a wolf pack.  A billionaire can decide not just to go to space, but to build an industry out of it.  The poor can't find enough food.  That is a huge difference.  Is there any research into quantifying these types of differences?<p>Sure a human level computer AI gets 'free' speed doubling every 18 months, but so does the intelligence that surrounds an augmented human.  Just look at how much more intelligence we have available to us now as compared to 20 years ago.<p>I agree that there will be/is an intelligence explosion.  My point is simply that we are already in the midst of it, or that there is no single instant to point at and say 'that is when the singularity started.'<p>I think that this is an important point to make because it changes the framing of the question from ""How can we survive abstract superintelligence explosion of the unknown future"" to ""How can we survive the existing intelligence explosion.""  From ""How can we teach the superintelligence we are bound to create to be nice"" to ""How can we convince the existing superintelligence to be nice"" and/or ""what changes in our social/governmental/memetic structure should we change to survive the explosion we are experiencing?""<p>Also, if we view ourselves as already being in the intelligence explosion we can look at how existing superintelligences treat other less intelligent beings to see where our culture is likely to head as the explosion continues.

On the other hand I think it's perfectly fine to nitpick at times. Those times would be if someone is very obviously ignorant of what a word means, especially if they use it wrong constantly.<p>But in the end I think being able to know when to pick those battles is a subtle social skill some people need to learn. It's really hard to explain. It's an interesting topic because it entails all the different ways humans communicate. It's not <i>just</i> words. It's tone, facial expression, volume, gestures, context, and even knowing a person's background or history can give you those subtle clues as to whether this is an ignorant person who needs to be corrected or if it's just an isolated fluke that still allows you to get the intended message and therefore requires no corrections from you.<p>Me?

And yet...<p>1) All three workstations with the Seagate drives have seen constant failure of Seagate drives.  They have different brands of motherboard and power supplies, and checking system and HDD temperature shows nothing unusual (ignoring, for the moment, if temperature even matters).<p>2) All the computers in the office without the Seagate drives - but on the same power circuit - have seen no hard drive failures.  At all.  And some of the affected workstations had additional non-Seagate drives, including some ancient old IDE drives.  None of the ""extra"" drives failed either.<p>3) Not long after the first round of failures, we noticed some power quality issues in the office.  I purchased a fairly high-end Liebert UPS which solved the power quality issues, but didn't seem to change the Seagate issues.<p>4) As WD drives were purchased and swapped into the three affected workstations, the failures seemed to stop.  Some of the WD drives have now been in service for significantly longer than some of the failed Seagate drives.<p>Of course, none of that proves anything, but the obvious explanations don't seem applicable.  My guess is that my first half dozen drives were from a bad lot #, and the remaining drives were some mix of:\n * Also from a bad lot #\n * Damaged in shipping\n * Were improperly refurbished\n * Failed due to sheer random coincidence<p>I'm pretty sure I didn't break the drive which was dead on arrival from Seagate, if nothing else.  :-)  If you have any other suggestions, I'd love to hear them though.

Here is what happened according to Slovak news [1]:<p>Slovak police was training explosive sniffing dogs at Poprad airport. They planted several samples of explosives in passengers' luggage (90 grams of RDX / Hexogen [2]).<p>Here versions differ - Slovak police claims they planted two, Irish media tell they planted eight samples. One of these was missed by dogs and subsequently police screwed up, forgot about it and let it pass to the airplane.<p>The explosive sample was in a baggage of Slovak citizen living and working in Ireland.<p>Once the police realized their mistake, they let know the pilot (still during the flight), and he was supposedly ok with it.<p>They also let know destination airport in Dublin. Again here versions differ - Slovak police says they did it already on Saturday, when the incident happened, Dublin airport claims they got the message only on Tuesday.<p>Three days after the flight, once Irish authorities got to know there is a missing explosive (from Slovak official sources), they sent a bomb disposal squad to poor unsuspecting passenger, cleaned two streets around him, and arrested him.<p>----<p>BTW This was not the first time such incident happened.

They've got the same TVs, digital cameras, etc. you'd find highly recommended on Amazon or anywhere else. Their Xbox 360 is no more failure prone than anyone else's.<p>Their computers range the gamut, but so does Dell.com. Most Best Buys now even have an extensive selection of Macs on their own wooden table. They've got every mp3 player worth considering (and many not). I bought my Diamond Rio there back in what must have been 98 or 99.<p>Amazon sells most electronics for about the same price as them. I just looked for my camera, the Cannon Powershot. $149 for the newer model at both places. (Perhaps time for me to upgrade).<p>It's really the sales tax that ruins the business case for shopping there. A copy of Halo is $3 more at Best Buy, and I have to wait in line. When my business bought a Macbook, we saved $100 buying it from Amazon. I could have gotten the same thing off the shelf at Best Buy or an Apple Store, but why pay extra?<p>And the computers I wouldn't buy there due to lack of customizability, which was the original point of the comment.

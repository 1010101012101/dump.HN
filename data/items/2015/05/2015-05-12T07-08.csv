This is known as an investment. It keeps paying dividends every time you use it.<p>>Then you have to write the code to use them, which depending on their interface may itself add a significant number of lines of code with potential for their own bugs (given a simple enough example, the integration code can be larger than the code you would have written).<p>Only if you&#x27;re a bad programmer, and/or you used a bad library.<p>>Then you have to include not just the library, but all its dependencies in your codebase.<p>For me this means adding one line to a file called &quot;requirements.txt&quot;. E.g. python-cjson==1.1.0. The setup scripts take care of the rest. Trivial.<p>>You&#x27;re then committed to keep track of the library and all its dependencies, and updating them if and when dangerous bugs are discovered.<p>Yep. Once a month or so I upgrade all of my libraries, run the tests and see what breaks. Mostly nothing breaks and the amount of thinking I have to do to take care of this problem is usually zero.<p>>This means that your code now has a reason to change or rot (API changes from upstream) that has nothing to do with you or any feature or bug you&#x27;ve written.<p>While true, stuff like cjson just doesn&#x27;t change its APIs. In practice, while this is a problem for some libraries, it&#x27;s one that is relatively minor.<p>The reverse is more usually true: upgrade everything and you get bugfixes for free. Good library designers do not change their APIs often but they do fix bugs frequently.<p>> If your requirement is later found out to be slightly unusual and not exactly covered by the library, you&#x27;re in for a world of pain working around that too (e.g. in the example given, this probably isn&#x27;t a valid xml file because it doesn&#x27;t have a single surrounding tag).<p>Hence &quot;choose a good library&quot;. For xml that means choose one that can deal with invalid XML because invalid XML is a problem you&#x27;re just going to have to deal with eventually if you use XML. I use libxml2. It&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s fast and it handles invalid XML well. I recommend it.<p>Better yet, don&#x27;t use XML coz it&#x27;s crap (not always avoidable, I know).<p>>The amazing thing is that this actually is worth it in many cases, but people often underestimate the cost.<p>The cost is higher if you choose poor libraries. Choosing a good library is more art than science, but if you do it right you will drop your costs like a rock.<p>It also helps to pick a big ecosystem + language that <i>has</i> good libraries.<p>>Sure, the poster you&#x27;re replying to isn&#x27;t a special flower that can write a better parser for whatever format, but he&#x27;s saying that in this case he doesn&#x27;t need one. A number of other commenters have pointed out that requirements change and the generic parser will be a better choice than evolving your homegrown simple code into a poorly thought out monster. This is true, but it&#x27;s also premature optimisation.<p>This is a misuse of the term premature optimization. You can prematurely optimize for speed. You <i>cannot</i> prematurely optimize to eliminate not invented here syndrome, code duplication or tight coupling.<p>>The right time to pull in those libraries is on the first non trivial change, not at the beginning.<p>No, the right time is at the beginning. If you need to parse JSON use a json parsing library. If you need to parse XML, use an XML parsing library.<p>If you&#x27;re worried google what people have to say about it. Do they say that it sucks? It&#x27;s glacially slow under the wrong conditions?<p>If you write loosely coupled and cohesive code as well, you can vastly reduce the costs of choosing a bad library later on.",1431417459

We take contracts out of Microsoft Word and email and put them in an online format that understands the business data and process that is involved. We&#x27;re solving problems form the low level (version tracking, redlining, commenting) to the high level (renewal reminders, workflows, tagging, reporting). We&#x27;re currently focussed on large businesses and enterprise.<p>To answer your question, there&#x27;s not many startups in the legal space because people and businesses are really worried about their contracts. The conservative nature is one that needs to slowly be eroded, and that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at now.

Typically, they solve some small part of the contracts problem: Assembling documents, or e-signatures, or workflows, etc. The competition isn&#x27;t just coming from startups (e.g. glider.com, acquired last year), it&#x27;s also coming from large incumbents (e.g. Merrill DataSite for contract management, launched last month).<p>It&#x27;s an exciting time and I think we&#x27;ll start to see big chunks of the problem solved over the next few years.",1431416937

Avvo is a matchmaking/profile aggregation startup that comes to mind.<p>I worked with Fenwick and West to incorporate <a href=""https://recent.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://recent.io/</a>, in part because I&#x27;ve had a relationship with them for a few years. But I see why people today use Clerky and pay ~15% as much.<p>A few other thoughts:<p>* Lawyers are some of the most conservative and risk-averse professionals you&#x27;ll find. So it will take a while for any newfangled innovations to become adopted.<p>* Those &quot;enormous fees&quot; are already being whittled down as part of a multi-decade shift away from Big Law in its traditional form, including fixed fees rather than hourly rates.<p>* Bar associations act as a cartel and try to restrict competition. Nolo, which publishes self-help software and books, was actually sued for daring to compete with lawyers (&quot;Unauthorized Practice of Law&quot;): <a href=""http://blog.nolo.com/blog/2011/04/11/the-brief-story-of-texas-vs-nolo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nolo.com/blog/2011/04/11/the-brief-story-of-texa...</a><p>* When you want tailored advice, a website with a bunch of forms (even forms created by smart lawyers) is likely insufficient. I know one trust attorney in the SF bay area who told me she had to figure out how to handle cryopreservation after some Silicon Valley execs wanted it; that required original research. When you&#x27;re in a situation where mistakes can cost you millions, hiring an attorney for tailored advice is cheap insurance.",1431415364

They were entire debates on whether it had been painted by a very famous artist or not, and if it did it would be worth millions. At no time did anyone wonder if the painting was actually beautiful.<p>And I know, it shows I am an ignorant unbeliever.

9530003,comment,9522467,9524454,0,0,kybernetikos,,,"> (you did pick a good one, right?)<p>So, the immediate costs to use are that you have to research a bunch of parsers to see which fit your needs and are &#x27;good&#x27;.  Then you have to write the code to use them, which depending on their interface may itself add a significant number of lines of code with potential for their own bugs (given a simple enough example, the integration code can be larger than the code you would have written).  Then you have to include not just the library, but all its dependencies in your codebase.  You&#x27;re then committed to keep track of the library and all its dependencies, and updating them if and when dangerous bugs are discovered.  This means that your code now has a reason to change or rot (API changes from upstream) that has nothing to do with you or any feature or bug you&#x27;ve written.  If your requirement is later found out to be slightly unusual and not exactly covered by the library, you&#x27;re in for a world of pain working around that too (e.g. in the example given, this probably isn&#x27;t a valid xml file because it doesn&#x27;t have a single surrounding tag and there may be other nonstandard issues in the input).<p>The amazing thing is that this actually is worth it in many cases, but people often underestimate the cost.<p>Sure, the poster you&#x27;re replying to isn&#x27;t a special flower that can write a better parser for whatever format, but he&#x27;s saying that in this case he doesn&#x27;t need one.  A number of other commenters have pointed out that requirements change and the generic parser will be a better choice than evolving your homegrown simple code into a poorly thought out monster.  This is true, but it&#x27;s also premature optimisation.<p>The right time to pull in those libraries is on the first non trivial change, not at the beginning.",1431414949

One just walked for some time, until one was alone or in more accepting company, and then started hunting and gathering wherever one found oneself.&quot;</i><p>Where danger can be found, banishment is death. Consider this quote from Sebastian Junger:<p><i>&quot;What all these people seem to miss isnâ€™t danger or loss, per se, but the closeness and cooperation that danger and loss often engender. Humans evolved to survive in extremely harsh environments, and our capacity for cooperation and sharing clearly helped us do that. Structurally, a band of hunter-gatherers and a platoon in combat are almost exactly the same: in each case, the group numbers between 30 and 50 individuals, they sleep in a common area, they conduct patrols, they are completely reliant on one another for support, comfort, and defense, and they share a group identity that most would risk their lives for.&quot;</i> [0]<p>There is a lot of anthropological studies that confirm this observation.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/05/ptsd-war-home-sebastian-junger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/05/ptsd-war-home-sebasti...</a>",1431414324

The Windows clipboard is <i>insanely</i> powerful, it&#x27;ll paste the best representation of your text in that your destination buffer can handle. If I copy a code segment from Visual Studio (or Notepad++ with the right plugin!) I get to keep syntax highlighting if I paste into a program that can handle colored text. But if I paste into Notepad, all formatting gets cleared.<p>Pasting into Notepad BTW is the standard way to clear any special formatting. Although an emdash isn&#x27;t special by any means, it is just a normal character that has a specific use in the typewritten English language.<p>> Apps that minimise to the small-icon part of the start bar (next to time) don&#x27;t go to the back of the alt+tab stack.<p>By design, and 100% up to the app creator. Alt-Tab switches between things on the taskbar. Things are minimized to the tray to keep them out of the way!<p>> They should bundle a python API to windows and a recent version of python also. Make it easy to create and ship python on Windows. A community would just grow around this, with no further effort from them.<p>IronPython? :-D<p>But I know what you mean, Python is fun.<p>> Weak scheduler, init mechanisms. (from user perspective)<p>On this I disagree! Windows exposes its startup routines in a very user friendly manner. On top of that, the way Services are initialized actually works w/o worry or concern. End users don&#x27;t have to deal with it, which is a blessing IMHO.<p>> There&#x27;s no nice IPC mechanism available for casual development. Cmd kind of has pipes but they&#x27;re horrible.<p>Windows has a plethora of IPC mechanisms available in native land, and .NET add in a few more!<p>Start off with the old time favorites like TCP/IP loopback and named pipes (both of which are pretty darn easy to get up and running) and go on from there.<p>But yeah, every OS has its oddities and warts. Heck if you write a clean room OS, by the time you are at version 1.01 cruft will have accumulated!",1431414283

Or it&#x27;s just that the product is new and actual demand curve hasn&#x27;t been established yet.<p>Absurdly, this is then hailed as an example of market efficiency, while there is nothing rational in such behavior from the game theory perspective (unless you consider much wider frame of how human morality evolved etc.).",1431414218

Get your financials together very quickly, and go down to every credit union and bank in your city (asking for a collateral-backed small business loan). A week is plenty of time to write these things down, you don&#x27;t need a fancy powerpoint, just numbers.<p>2. Sell 115k of the assets quickly, keep 78k of them, keep running the business (on a smaller scale) and slowly build your assets back up.<p>3. Declare bankruptcy to get a stay-of-execution from whatever liability is coming due in 2 weeks. This would, at least, but you a little time. Not sure of the bankruptcy laws where you are, but in the US, your assets would either be auctioned off, or you&#x27;d set up some kind of payment plan with your creditors, depending on the type of bankruptcy you elected... and then you&#x27;d slowly work your way out of it.<p>4. Open up a line of credit for the business, or get a line of credit on your personal assets (like a HELOC on your home). I&#x27;m not a fan of either option, but if you&#x27;re in need, you might want to resort to those.",1431414114

During our evolutionary history, our ancestors would have inhabited a social world in which registering the sex and life-history stage of an individual would have enabled a large variety of useful probabilistic inferences about that individual. In contrast, ancestral hunter-gatherers traveled primarily by foot and, consequently, residential moves of greater than 40 miles would have been rare (16). Given the breeding structure inherent in such a world, the typical individual would almost never have encountered people sampled from populations genetically distant enough to qualify as belonging to a different 'race' (even assuming that such a term is applicable to a nonpolytypic species such as humans, in which the overwhelming preponderance of genetic variation is within population and not between population, and at most geographically graded rather than sharply bounded) (17, 18).""",1231005423

418492,comment,417542,417542,0,0,aaronsw,,,"Wow, this article is so wildly ignorant of the basic economics.<p>Let's start at the beginning. Depressions are caused by a slight increase in people's preference to hold onto cash, which causes a downward spiral where the economy slows and then people want to hold onto cash more.<p>The first thing you try to do in this instance is increase the money supply, but we've gone as far as we can go on that -- the Fed has sent the interest rate to zero and it can't go any lower.<p>So, as Keynes said, the second thing you try to do in that scenario is let government spending pick up the slack and take advantage of the productive capacity that isn't being used on anything to get the economy moving again.<p>Greenspun claims this won't work because ""a lot more globalized today and there is much more competition among countries."" First, we've only recently caught up to the levels of international integration we had during the first wave of globalization, starting in 1870. Second, countries don't compete with each other. The fundamental well-being of a country is determined by simply its domestic productivity. What would we be competing for?<p>He seems to suggest that we're competing for international investment dollars. But then why do you think government investment won't work? Why is international investment this magical thing we must attract to start businesses?<p>He claims that Japan's huge fiscal stimulus proves stimulus doesn't work. But in Japan, stimulus did work -- when it was tried. As the leading scholar wrote: ""the 1995 stimulus package ... did result in solid growth in 1996, demonstrating that fiscal policy does work when it is tried. As on earlier occasions in the 1990s, however, the positive response to fiscal stimulus was undercut by fiscal contraction in 1996 and 1997.""<p>See <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/items/200812220005"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mediamatters.org/items/200812220005</a> for more.",1231004395

418489,comment,418386,418386,0,0,parenthesis,,,"Anecdotally: at university I observed that my fellow students tended to prefer philosophy lecturers who told interesting little stories, jokes and asides. But whilst entertaining at the time, I always preferred the lecturers who just got down to the arguments etc., because they provided a constant stream of substantive points and arguments for me to write in my notes. And getting relevant material written down is actually useful for learning and getting good grades, whereas thinking 'what a caution that lecturer is', and expanding one's repertoire of philosophy jokes and anecdotes isn't.<p>On the other hand, I did have a couple of maths lecturers who managed to combine getting down to the nitty-gritty with some effective crowd-pleasing moments, which afforded one a break from concentrating for a moment.<p>So, for my part, I would tend to agree that if helping people learn is the goal, tangential 'interesting details' should be minimised.",1231004227

The core of people who incessantly edits do make a lot of edits, but they're cleaning up vandalism or bringing articles into the proper Wikipedia style, not actually writing articles and contributing new facts.

Nuts are extremely impact resilient, using them in these pods could not only provide re-forestation, but also provide an economic source.<p>However, IMO the best thing we could be doing is taking areas of desertified land and fighting it.

Spread the grass and in desert areas you'll be catching dew every morning in the traps and the grass will itself.<p>Once you've spread the grass, spread shrubs. The Caragana arborescens is a miracle plant for these purposes. It traps moisture, it acts as a windbreak (stopping desertification), it provides a food source (peas), it's fast growing, it's a dense-spreader.

I think it's the combination of fantastic guests, and you asking the really interesting questions (that are often somewhat uncomfortable), and sort of harping on them a bit until you get it across. That's what I tend to do also.<p>I want to give some negative feedback too: I read the transcript this time instead of watching. (1). It was a little slow to start, so I skimmed a bit near the beginning, but it quickly got interesting (I don't know how to fix this - I do the same thing with many great theatlantic articles). (2). One reason I read the transcript was that I do feel a little uncomfortable with the probing questions - but that's also what I value most. (so again I can't offer a solution). (3). Another reason to not watch the video is that I feel really uncomfortable when you look away from the guest while they are talking (while eg. googling something) - it <i>feels</i> really rude (even though I know it's not). And for this one, I have a solution to suggest! I think it's really demanding on you to maintain eye-contact throughout a long interview, and TV interviewers don't need to do this, because it's edited to cut between the interviewer and guest. So it's your format, of showing both heads, that creates this problem. So a simple solution is to just cut to the guest when you google or otherwise need to look away (assuming your video software has a hotkey for that).<p>Anyway, the ratio of my negative vs. positive comment length doesn't reflect my opinion, which was that this was another excellent interview -  thanks very much!",1287621117

1813726,comment,1812872,1813279,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I'm not sure; I think it actually lowers security in two ways. One is that people just don't take it seriously any more (eg <a href=""http://www.geekandproud.net/terror/images/terror-all.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geekandproud.net/terror/images/terror-all.jpg</a>) and teh second one is by constant reminders of being in a defensive position. For example, most BART (subway) stations in San Francisco still have their restrooms locked 'for security reasons following the September 11 attacks,' which is rather pathetic. Of course, this saves on staffing costs, and it's probably a net positive for public health considering how poorly maintained some of them were, but it's a case of cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.<p>When I lived in London in the early-mid 90s the threat of terrorist bombing by the IRA and their offshoots was a constant problem - you could figure on a significant commuter train delay at least once every two weeks. Mostly they were false alarms, but real bombings were just frequent enough to make caution a necessity even though casualties were low - arguably the most effective result for the terrorists was to disrupt with a bomb but phone in a warning ahead so that there would not be any casualties, or detonate one where there were not many people. But although it was a constant problem and there were lots of warning signs of the 'be alert!' variety, I didn't feel the sort of theatrical approach I do here. That changed later, after a variety of both terrorist and ordinary criminal incidents were solved with the aid of CCTV video, and the UK went insane for CCTV, putting up so many cameras that (to me, at least) London started to feel like a prison camp. I think over-reliance on technology is part of the problem here. I don't mind seeing a lot of uniformed police or security personnel about, even though many of them may be more for display than anything else. But what I see in the US right now is lots of security devices like magnetic gates and so on, plus the same number of (usually bored) uniformed personnel to man them. These have become so ubiquitous that in Washington DC people can no longer walk up the steps into the Supreme Court, they have to enter via a side entrance where the magnetometer gates (or whatever they're called) are installed. At least one justice has complained about the small but symbolically significant failure implied when people can't walk into the nation's highest court (the rather lame response has been that people can still exit via the famed steps, so justice is seen to be be in the building that way...whoopee). What we have here is a case of 'nondurable precautions' - putting a machine in there to avert liability, because while machines may be no more reliable than humans, if a failure occurs it's much easier to blame the machine and diffuse the liability than to scapegoat someone for being closest point of failure, even if they were truly at fault.",1287620273

Apple is extending the value it delivers to its Mac customers by launching a combination of new hardware (MacBook Air) combined with an innovative operating system (OS X Lion), building out a collection of new complements (OS X application store), and further linking Macs with Apple’s other thin computing devices (via Facetime).<p>If we step back, and consider today’s announcements from a broader perspective, we can gain some insight about Apple’s overall corporate strategy with respect to its position in the future of computing.<p>Apple’s recent product innovations have largely focused around thin devices, first the iPod, then the iPhone and Touch, the Apple TV, and recently the iPad. The new MacBook Air coupled with the new Mac OS X Lion represents a natural progression from the iPad. While Apple’s other thin devices are better suited for consuming content and media, the new MacBook Air is Apple’s first thin device that is particularly well suited for creating content and media (note that Apple is referring to the new MacBook Air as “The Next Generation of MacBooks”). Meanwhile, the new OS X application store extends Apple’s success with iTunes and the App Store to the Mac environment, thus further establishing Apple’s presence in cloud services and online media. Facetime, along with other services such as MobileMe, provides the linkages that begin connecting all these thin devices and services together.<p>Looking broadly, Apple is now pushing the frontier on two key fronts. On the one hand there’s thin device computing with the iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and now its new MacBook Air products; each targeting a distinctive market segment, roughly arranged by those customers seeking to consume (iPod) or create media (new MacBook Air). On the other hand, Apple is developing a range of cloud services and online media with iTunes, the current App Store, and now the new OS X application store. iTunes already operates across platforms and, despite its name, now includes much more than music, given it also provides a gateway to movies, TV shows, Podcasts, Audiobooks, and so on. As Apple continues to push forward on these two fronts it will soon have developed a full and coherent line of thin device hardware, a unified and powerful operating system (iOS/OS X, and slight variants), and a tightly integrated set of cloud services and online media.<p>In closing, today’s product introductions, along with Apple’s rapid progression over the last decade in thin devices and cloud services, brings into stark relief the gap between Apple and the historical high flyers in personal computing, such as Dell and HP. It appears Google is the only company that fairs a chance to stay competitive in this breakneck race.<p>(I just posted this to my blog and submitted the post to HN.

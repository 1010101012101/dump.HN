The value of the social network will increase the more people are on it.<p>Facebook should pursue a strategy similar to operating system companies and focus on becoming the market standard. Facebook should focus on becoming the standardized social media platform on the internet.<p>Also another ultimate goal is to focus on making facebook the new desktop. So when a person first turns on his computer, he opens browser and then facebook. And all internet interactions are done through facebook. watching and discovering content, ecommerce, social interaction should all be done through the facebook platform.",1258443808
946105,comment,945972,945972,0,0,ramchip,,,"The article mentions updating a warehousing software by updating individual copies and making these interoperate with the older copies, so the system can be progressively updated. It also talks about machines that would run without ever being stopped or rebooted. Yet there is no mention of Erlang or updating an application while it's running, which I find rather surprising.",1258443240
946104,comment,946075,946075,0,0,daeken,,,"This is definitely interesting, but I'd love to see other .NET framework implementations open sourced as well.  The micro framework is the only one I know of that doesn't JIT the code, but rather interprets CIL directly, and it also uses a simple mark-and-sweep GC.<p>Since footprint is the main constraint here, it'd be nice to see an optimizing CIL compiler combined with this to produce native images.  You could cut a whole lot of code out of the runtime by doing so, while increasing performance by a huge amount.",1258443188

946101,comment,945928,945928,0,0,mustpax,,,"The article contains a single anecdote about someone not looking for work due to unemployment benefits. How does it follow from this that such benefits are extending the recession?<p>Is the author saying that unemployment benefits keep consumer spending down? If the person's take home pay is about the same, as the article suggests, this should not be an issue.<p>Maybe the author is suggesting that unemployment benefits create a shortage of labor by discouraging workforce participation? This would be an even harder argument to make given the continued layoffs across all sectors of the economy.",1258442697

It's healthier to move on.<p>I've got mixed feelings about the legitimacy of someone collecting unemployment while attempting a bootstrap. For the startup-minded, trying to get a project to self-sufficiency is in a way ""searching for a job"". I'm not sure either they or the public treasury would be better served by them aggressively seeking a W-2 job, even though that may be the ostensible requirement of the unemployment compensation program.<p>(Unless the abuse is really blatant -- drawing a consistent documented salary-like payment -- I also doubt most state bureaucracies would or could do anything to cut off payments.)",1258442154

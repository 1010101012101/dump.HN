3342037,comment,3341641,3341641,7,0,mbeswetherick,,,"Making money in music today's music industry is absurd. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if major record labels vanished in the next 100 years.<p>You'd imagine a band that's put out a record on a successful label and toured the world multiple times would be covered in wealth. That's not the case at all. In fact, most touring bands don't even make enough money to be in the black. At the end of the day, past the flights, cost of gas, and cheap meals lies an elastic state of negative to mediocre profit.<p>Why then do small acts still tour? Well, it's fun and it's probably been a dream of theirs for some time now. I for one am extremely thankful that bands continue to put out amazing music with only enough money to barely support themselves.<p>Here's the thing: bands don't need major labels anymore. That's because it's basically level playing field now: you can make an amazing album on your laptop in a barn in rural Massachusetts and still have the ability to compete with the major labels. No longer are people sucked into the radio aggregate of the 90's when all you could discover were boy bands. Now we have these amazing things like Bandcamp and Spotify that allow you to stream virtually anything! That's pretty amazing, but what's the use if everyone is listening to the demands of a major label?<p>So with that being the case, couldn't this problem be solved? All it will take is a push for bands to stay away from huge labels and for listeners to find that music. That's where Spotify should come in.<p>What's interesting about this entire thing is that a long tail company like Spotify is potentially able to shift the power from the shit that most major labels produce to better and more meaningful music. If Spotify can find a way to direct people's tastes away from most major label garbage, they might be able to solve this issue.<p>Maybe Spotify will push for more independent artists and incorporate musicians on Bandcamp into their catalog.<p>Although I'm pretty sure that musicians who put their music directly on Spotify only receive a pretty small cut, Spotify should be able to overcome their major label woes by putting a focus on smaller more niche based music.<p>It is my hope that musicians stay away from large labels. And no, I am not some indie purist, I just think that major labels are diluting the quality and diversity of music and that we have the power to change that.",1323658534

Started <i>working</i> as a software dev in 1994.

C on VAX Unix. Those were the days.

Infosys was founded in 1981, for example.<p>I never worked for Infosys or any of the large outsourced services dev companies, but the idea that there are no developers in India with 15+ years experience is rubbish. (Not getting into whether  'number of years of experience' is a valid metric for judging sw talent).<p>And as for ""living and breathing code"", I started programming when I was 10 years old, on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum in the Eighties, writing games in ZX-80 assembler. We even had a club for Spectrum devs - in a small town in South India, in the eighties. I have many classmates who still code every day (though they have fancy titles like ""Senior Architect"" these days).<p>Did most of my generation of coders move into management? Sure they did. Are the good developers swamped by tonnes of clueless people flocking to the ""hot career""? Sure they are. But none of that is specific to India.<p>If you have to deal with dumb Indians off a boat who can't speak English but seem to take your jobs, I sympathize. There  <i>are</i> a lot of dumb Indian devs. But I've also had to deal with a lot of dumb American devs who think they are automatically superior to all Indian devs ""just because"". Plenty of those too.<p>(all this is just to  counter your idea that people with 15 years of experience writing code don't exist here and ""the software industry has only been there for the last 5-10 years"" (roll eyes).

In general I'm for copyright and I'm talking about the huge number of people who think there's nothing wrong with pirating movies, music, and software and have a long list of excuses for it. Now, even I can get on board with what you're saying. The 15 year old kid who uses some copyrighted video or audio in a YouTube video should <i>not</i> be prosecuted. And there are lots of cases like that where it would be silly to prosecute. Now, in the case of the Pulp Fiction scene reordering from the post, I don't think anyone should get in trouble and I personally think there's no need to take it down but that's not my call and I think if the creators decide that it shouldn't be published we need to respect that.<p>We have to remember that the YouTube system is automated though so they can't review things manually. That means no one is there to judge that gray area.

It may be in the interest of everyone to just let this occur without starting up a business which tries to find a middle ground.<p>But there will always be companies springing up to take a gamble on being the first to exploit a new opportunity. If Spotify (or whoever) fails, perhaps the next music streaming service will be the one to meet a much weakened music distribution industry in the courts.<p>Once the labels are gone, services which offer subscription models for music will thrive without the threat of legal action. And the quality and variety of music available to the masses will thrive.<p>This is a waiting game, and I think we all know exactly how this will eventually play out.

If, say, Warner decides to cut the share of Spotify's revenue they demand in half, that just means Sony BMG and Universal can up their demands.  And both of them will be convinced that if they don't, the other one will, so both will...which means Spotify would be no better off.  The entire process would just be Warner giving money to Sony BMG and Universal, which is hardly helpful to anyone other than Sony BMG and Universal shareholders.<p>And even if - through some miracle - you got the big three to agree to give Spotify an even break, there's the constant risk that one of them could come back and demand every dime Spotify is making at any time.

Currently, my leading option is New Zealand, bundled with their student visa is a permit to work 20 hours a week, and a year's residency after the completion of your program among other things.<p>US has almost the same case, as far as STEM students go. You can get a F-1 visa for 5 years, which includes permission to work 20 Hours on campus, or 40 hours off-campus for work related to your education (like a internship or something). Once you are done with 5-6 years of your PhD, you get Optional practical training time(12 months), during which you can take a job, etc. If you are in STEM category,you get another 17 month extension.

3341916,comment,3341343,3341343,21,0,dewarrn1,,,"This submission's title is misleading, and the original work could be better summarized as ""improving at one task while doing another"".  The authors first determined a pattern of brain activation (indexed by blood flow) associated with the presentation of a target (visual) stimulus for a given subject.  Then, they gave subjects real-time feedback about their brain activation while they performed a superficially different task.  The trick is that the feedback on the second, different task was based on a subject's ability to cause the same pattern of brain activation (again, indexed by blood flow) that the experimenters first observed when the target stimulus was presented in the earlier session.  Finally, subjects were tested on their ability to identify the target stimulus and others like it, and they showed a statistically reliable improvement for the (unknowingly) trained target, but not for other, similar items.  It's fascinating, but suggesting that this is anything like what's been depicted in science fiction movies (yes, like The Matrix) is silly.",1323655660

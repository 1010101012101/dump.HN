I too enjoy it though I never actually tried Dvorak so I can't compare them from personal experience. Changing was quick. The only problems that I have experienced are switching from Colemak to QWERTY, setting and using passwords that have to be used with more than one layout, and the occasional problem with at one character not working correctly in the cygwin terminal.",1249336775

It would be nice if this could be formalized—have banks offer a service where they sell packets of marked, sequential and perhaps even non-legal-tender bills that you can put in these obvious places. (Of course, the fact that they should be hard for a burglar to recognize at first glance means that they might be used as counterfeits—so an equivalent sum of real money should be kept at the bank as a ""deposit"" (not in the banking sense of the word) to ensure good will.)",1249336705

This is just taking it to a new level, where companies can pay anyone to endorse their product.  I see the effectiveness of this strategy to be limiting because the endorsement is not authentic.  Obama doesn't recommend blackberry to his friends because he's paid.  College kids didn't create facebook accounts for all their friends because Mark cut them a check.

They are perfect examples of the problems with the app store from a developer's perspective - arbitrary judgement calls which often end up being inconsistently applied.  Apps do get rejected all the time for having ""limited functionality"" - these two concerns should be addressed during the approval process, and, if necessary, by removing specific apps, NOT by outright banning a developer AFTER the apps are approved (thus signaling to the developer that Apple is OK with them).  If there are ""too many"" apps, throw in a per-app listing fee after a certain number of apps. If the app is low quality, don't approve it. These are messy, hard to define rules otherwise.<p><i>intellectual property complaints concerning over 100 of your Applications</i> - Say a developer has 8 apps in the app store, one of the eight apps uses unlicensed images, and Apple bans the developer instead of removing the one app.  I suspect the reaction here would be a bit different.<p>The ONLY acceptable reason in this case is repeated copyright infringement - easy to define, easy to detect, and simple for the developer to avoid in the first place.

Period. Cases are dismissed every day for failing this fundamental requirement.<p>But, you say, there's a statute that presumes some level of damages. That's true. What's also true is that the statute authorizes punitive damages, lumped together with actual damages.<p>That's a problem under recent due process / punitive damages jurisprudence. Per the Campbell case, you cannot have punitive damages that grossly exceed the actual damages. Here, actual damages appear to be a single person's use of 30 songs, yet the jury awarded $675,000. There is, quite obviously, a large punitive element.<p>You are not in a position to argue these punitives were only a small fraction of the award, since, as noted above, actual damages proven were, at most, $30.<p>Your argument is that Congress can simply sweep these issues aside, lump them together in a statute, and be done with it.<p>That's not how constitutional law works.",1249333722

Once the author had specified the problem, I thought of the solution in my head ""he's going to map over the epochs, rounding them to dates, and then call merge-with"". Scroll down, yep, almost exactly what I had in mind.<p>I don't normally do that in other languages. I attribute a large part of that to the map/filter/reduce paradigm. Functional languages tend to have a much more expressive vocabulary than C/C++/Java. Rather than writing a for loop to filter an array, you just write (filter ...). The language is almost declarative, in that you specify <i>what</i> you want to happen, rather than <i>how</i>.<p>Tests are an important part of developing these days. They should count in pg's assertion that program shortness == power. Needing to write fewer tests to be sure of a program's correctness is an important attribute.",1249333577

Since the plaintiffs didn't have to ""prove"" the amount of damages due to unauthorized distribution, you unilaterally and rather brazenly set the figure at zero. You then use the figure used during a separate demonstration (by the defendants, I might add) of how easy it is to download music legally, along with the courts determination that unauthorized reproduction took place, to get to your 20,000-to-1 ratio. You do see that this is preposterous, don't you?<p>Essentially, your logical flaw is to apply a court case that has nothing to do with copyright to one that is purely about copyright. In the case you reference, it is in theory possible to determine the damages caused: just sum the quantities spent by each of the plaintiffs on doctors' fees and other medical expenses. It is impossible to do that in the context of unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material. This is why the statutes give the courts leeway in this domain -- as you   have acknowledged elsewhere.<p>If we take your argument it its logical conclusion, the maximum damages for sharing a song should be $4, since one can never ""prove"" the quantity of damages resulting from unauthorized distribution. Do you really think that damages of this size are going to deter anyone from filesharing?",1249333209

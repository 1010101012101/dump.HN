1745680,comment,1743398,1743398,0,0,JimmyL,,,"Best of luck with this - political software is a great niche industry, although a very competitive one.<p>If you're looking for a new feature, I would suggest some type of offline mode. Many people have this image of a political phone bank being a room full of people on headsets with computer screens in front of them, reciting carefully-prepared statements. For centrally-run national campaigns, this is correct. But for more local ones - which make up the vast majority of campaigns, and the ones with the lowest barrier to entry - a campaign office is a vacant storefront in a mall, and a phone bank is eight people in some spare cubicles with old Nortel handsets. Find a way to make this software useful for them.<p>How? Maybe something like call sheets. I press the ""Call Sheet"" button, select that I want a sheet of 50 callers, and your software will generate a printed piece of paper with 50 names on it, with each name having the appropriate check-boxes next to them. I can then give that to a volunteer who will call the dial-in number, enter the PIN for that sheet, and your PBX will call though the names on the sheet they're given in the order listed, and they can check off the details. When they're done, they give it to a volunteer who does data entry about the results.<p>Want to get fancier? Make your call sheets optical-scan. Instead of handing the completed call sheet to a volunteer who does data entry, hand it to some guy with a scanner. The scanning volunteer places the call sheet in a standard $60 OfficeMax scanner, and presses the ""Send PDF via Email"" button on the scanner, and sends it to a custom email address you've supplied them with. Your service then scans the PDF, figures out how the volunteers have marked the sheets, and presents the results (and any ambiguities) to the volunteer who is doing data validation, as opposed to entry.<p>Two more (simpler) suggestions:<p>- The ways to respond to a call should be customizable, if they're not already. As opposed to just yes/no, I'd like my volunteers to be able to select a few checkboxes about each respondent (guesses at party ID, how committed they sound, possible follow-ups, etc.).<p>- Add some keyboard shortcuts. I know I said earlier that most phone banks aren't guys with headsets and laptops, but some are. For those keeners, may as well make it easy for them to do all their call categorization without having to keep mousing around.<p>Another interesting approach - and Obama's team did something like this - was to set up for distributed phone banking, taking advantage of people who have free evenings on their cell phones. A volunteer would dial into your system, get connected to someone to speak to, and then when the call finishes get kicked into an IVR system for categorization (""Press 1 for Democrat, press 2 for Republican, press 3 for Undecided"" etc.). Once they've entered their IVR response, connect them to their next caller, and repeat until they hang up. You'd have to come up with some decent access control (to prevent opposition candidates from calling in and screwing with your voter lists), but it seems like you could probably do this whole module with some judicious use of Twillo (or whatever PBX you're now using as a back-end).<p>While I'm thinking about this, I would also reconsider your pricing model. There is nothing a campaign manager likes more than cost certainty, and right now your service doesn't have it. If I let a room full of volunteers at your service for four hours, I don't really know what it would cost my campaign, which would scare me. On the other hand, if you charged by the call I could say to myself ""we want to do a call blitz tonight, so I'm going to budget out enough for 5,000 calls"", pay that, and be safe knowing that no matter how productive my volunteers are, I'll be able to have a hard cap on how much I'm going to spend in a metric I'm used to using and can compare across mediums (engagement cost). Put another way, it's a hell of a lot easier to go to the finance committee/candidate and say ""we're going to use this fancy new service to make 1,000 calls"" as opposed to ""we're going to use this fancy new service for 800 minutes, and I'm really not sure how many calls.""",1285898083

Not the most scientific test of a codec, but as a Web company they are interested in improving image serving more than image authoring.<p>As for the recompression, you can losslessly squeeze a JPEG by at least 15% (e.g. StuffIt came out with this a few years back, claiming higher numbers but mainly at low bitrates I think).  In the lossy camp, H264's intra-frame encoding significantly outdoes both JPEG and JPEG2000.<p>WebP is probably similar to H264 intra.  As for recompression vs. straight compression, this probably has little effect to the extent JPEG and WebP are ""compatible"", e.g. both being block-based transforms.  It would be unfair, on the other hand, to run a very different codec after JPEG and compare it to WebP after JPEG, because the other codec might be working hard to encode the JPEG artifacts.",1285897165

I've had access to the web in my house off and on since I was 11 (25 now) and even when things dragged along via dial-up, I always felt like I had all kinds of info at my fingertips.  I'd go to class in high school armed with all kinds of facts and background info on topics that the teachers (especially in history classes, for example) never would have/could have covered.<p>My parents were always all for dropping me and my bro off at the library, but something about finding out about stuff by going from link to link is just more fluid than walking out with a ton of books (some of which may not even be all current).<p>During college, I picked up Rails and all this open source stuff--the databases, servers, etc.--that I really wouldn't have gotten to in classes until my senior year.  'twas all made possible by going from link to link, blog to blog.<p>Overall, I'm just happy that whatever I want to know is always going to just be right there as long as I have some kind of internet connection.  It's always been an advantage in my book.<p>Socially, I'm glad I can stay connected to whomever despite not physically being within a convenient distance of any of my really good friends.  Despite Facebook and Twitter, iChat and Skype keep me connected and able to <i>see</i> friends from college who are allover the place. Seeing a friend react in real-time to some new shirt you bought, for example, really beats even just the telephone.  It all makes the world smaller and a lot closer.<p>Gotta love the internet...!",1285896251

A set costs hundreds of dollars... and is eclipsed by Wikipedia + google.<p>I used to collect cast-off databooks (National Instruments, TI, Motorola, Intel, etc.), now all that information and more is only a google search away.<p>I used to buy ARRL Handbooks to learn about electronics and circuits.  Now I mostly don't bother (just kidding, I still dabble in electronics, but gave up my Ham license many years ago - just wasn't interested in talking to random strangers).  Hmmm, now I type text to random strangers and browse random strangers' blogs.<p>I used to subscribe to magazines (e.g. Byte, Dr. Dobbs) to learn about computers and software, now I run, read, and contribute to Open Source projects.<p>You know how you always forget the bad stuff and only remember the good stuff?  Looking back, I remember a lot of cool things I did, but I kind of blank out how much effort it was to find the necessary information.<p>On the dark side, I waste a <i>lot</i> of time on the internet.

That would make the naive figure $6.69.  However the USA ran a $1.4 trillion dollar deficit.  That means that fully 40% of federal spending was paid for by future debt, not taxpayer revenue.  That reduces the figure spent on the DEA down to $4.015.  As for the remaining difference, I suspect that the numbers don't count social security as a tax (officially it is not a tax, and officially money transferred from social security to the general revenue via purchases of treasury bonds is debt owed back to social security at some future point) which reduces the amount that comes out of your actual federal income taxes.<p>Furthermore the USA has some other forms of revenue.

I don't feel that we have a clear, achievable goal in Afghanistan, and I'm appalled at the complete apathy by the media and America public to the fact that we are at war, both taking and losing lives.",1285894944

He basically advises projecting forward to when you're 80 years old. Ask yourself if at that time, would you regret X? This helps you frame your decisions with more of a long term view of your world. Helps you forget about some of the smaller stuff (like financial security).<p>Also in most cases, you can always go back to your cushy job if needed.",1285894901

Tasty free morsels given by fisherman often turn out to have hooks attached.<p>2) It appears that one has to give up any patents that read on to a baseline spec for JPEG. This sounds like it could be bad for large multimedia companies who want to retain rights to an image format - what's the baseline. If the baseline is something like ""uses huffman codes to compress image data"" then this is going to be a potential huge cost in IPR given up.<p>These are possibly unfounded, just first thoughts at 2am.",1285894891

Definitely no ""wow!"" factor for me.<p>What would have a ""wow!"" factor is if they partnered with media and credit card companies to create a system to model people's beliefs and desires, and use <i>that</i> to sell ads.",1194425365

Messing with people and their whims is not a simple job - people grumbled a lot when facebook opened up outside college. A lot of people I know had that ""why the hell is my dad on facebook""? moment.<p>Same thing when they introduced the ""news feed"" (or ""stalker feed"" as people used call it). I'm sure they are keeping the comfort of their users in mind, changing things a little at a time.",1194425094

It's not surprising that his supporters disagree with that notion, as it implies that their efforts and views are not legitimate.<p>BTW, here is a video of Ron Paul with a bunch of hackers. The room was completely packed and overflowing into a second room (connected by video). Of course they aren't all RP supporters, but a large fraction are.

76945,comment,76784,76825,0,0,ntoshev,,,"Indeed. The wealth that Facebook creates is that it enhances social capital, and this move capitalizes on it brilliantly.<p>They are so good in designing features that fit in the way their society works, I wonder what is their systematic approach to do so. Google can test features on small % of their users, Facebook can't do this because it doesn't really show how the feature will scale. <p>Geeks with a design sense are valuable, perhaps geeks with social sense get even more valuable. But I don't believe they just have a group of social geniuses that understand technology there.",1194423041

I do not think you deserve an explanation from me, but I will still give one for the intelligent and respectful others. Most successful companies today were started by engineers who were working on a product/service as a project. After realizing that they are sitting on something  valuable (and most likely this happens by accident), they start to look into building a company around the product.  Several people wake up and have the intention to start a business. I think that most people who want to start a business first then try to find a problem to tackle are the ones who need this sort of article. And they are also the ones who are more likely to Fail. I am not being rude it is just a fact.",1194422695

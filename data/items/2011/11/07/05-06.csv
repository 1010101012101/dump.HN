3205203,comment,3202081,3204927,1,0,jacques_chester,,,"Your replies so far are excellent. You're pointing out things I've overlooked, thanks.<p>> However, because there is no way to set constraints across joins, in practice, the dependencies of data constraints are as important as the dependencies of data values.<p>I don't follow your argument here. Could you restate it?<p>> As far as recursive queries, I am not 100% sure this is ideal either from a read performance perspective. There are times when recursive queries are helpful from a performance perspective, but I don't see a good way to index, for example, path to a node.<p>Poking around the Oracle documentation and Ask Tom articles, it seems to be more art than science; mostly based on creating compound indices over the relevant fields. Oracle is smart enough to use an index if it's there for a recursive field, but will struggle unless there's a compound index for other fields. I don't see an obvious way to create what you might call 'recursive indices', short of having an MV.<p>> Certainly most databases don't do this well enough to be ideal for hierarchical directories.<p>It'll never perform as well as a specialised system. But relational never will. An RDBMS won't outperform a K/V store on K/V problems, won't outperform a file system for blob handling and so on. This is just another example of the No Free Lunch theorem in action.<p>My contention is that we, as a profession of people who Like Cool Things, tend to discount the value of ACID early and then painfully rediscover its value later on. The business value of ACID is not revealable in a benchmark, so nobody writes breathless blog posts where DrongoDB is 10,000x more atomic than MetaspasmCache.",1320645541

I hate this concept, and here's why. \n Some have argued that giving music away free devalues music. I disagree. Asking people what they think music is worth devalues music. Don't believe me? Write and record something you really believe is great and release it to the public as a ""pay-what-you-think-it's-worth"" model and then let's talk.

3205146,comment,3204525,3204525,9,0,Skywing,,,"tl;dr: If a book were going to teach somebody how to program then you wouldn't be asking this question. A book requires a self-motivated person to pick it up and read it. Assuming you're trying to teach somebody who didn't have the desire to learn on their own, then you're going to have to relate to them and explain it in a way that they'll understand. Getting them interested and excited about it usually seems to be the best kick-starter.<p>You know what? I've actually unintentionally taught several people the basics of programming. I work at a small company with other bright people who are not programmers by study, but have learned how to communicate programming with me. I truly believe that teaching somebody to program is as easy as figuring out how to best explain something sequential to them. Usually, I begin my stealth teachings under the guise of me just trying to help them communicate their program requirements or ideas to me. I quickly jump into the lower level explanations of things and somehow I manage to get them excited or interested enough that they actually feel like talking ""programming"" with me will be cool. I try to explain to them that programming is like giving the computer an ordered list of things to do, and it'll do them exactly in that order. As simple as 1, 2, 3. I then explain loops. I don't get into functions and classes because that's not necessarily important to them understanding the flow of logic. Most people seem to easily grasp the concepts of if-then, and loops ... this is all really simple stuff for most people to understand at a basic level. I don't even necessarily mean code, but more so logically what an if-else means. I find that most people generally give you the ""yea yea I got it"" type of response while explaining this. Once I get them to this point, they're where I wanted them to be. I then try to include them in scenarios where I'm debugging something. I don't deliberately ask them to help me do my job, but I more so start talking out loud and usually they'll come over to help brainstorm. I show them my code, and explain the logic flow (if-else, loops, etc). You'll be surprised at how easy it is for people to actually help out here. Sometimes it's the non-programmers who can give the most obvious advice. At this point in time, it's up to them. If they're interested enough they'll progress from them, otherwise it may just no be their thing. I work with 8 people, and I have actually had one guy learn Python and he now writes Python tools for us - he knew zero programming. I also got our accountant into programming because he would always ask me the status of projects, and slowly over time I got him speaking ""programmer-speak"" with me, and now he basically understands all my programming yammer. I realize that these guys are not writing the next Redis or Twitter, but they were non-technical guys who are now on their way to being on their way to writing those things. :)",1320644063

American employers aren't necessarily going to be aware of the quality / legitimacy of a degree from a foreign institution, hell, for all they know a degree from a college there could be roughly equivalent to a high school degree here, with a few college-level courses thrown in. I don't think I even know of a single person I work with who has a degree in computer science, plenty have degrees in another subject, but is this really making them better developers?<p>Overall, its a tough issue, I'm all for having some of the best and brightest from other places come here, those who can come here and be a net-positive, but, in my experience there are some who just come because they know its a ticket to a better way of life and they aren't necessarily passionate about what they do and generally don't have what I observe to be a strong work ethic. On the other hand, some do and I have no problem with them being here.

Of course I can't prove this as people are generally hush hush about their salary / pay rate anyways so generally its something thats very hard to prove, just a general feeling I suppose from my own experience. Also, with most jobs I've had so far, I was the one who named the rate I was willing to work for (I'm learning this may not be the best idea, but that's something else entirely), at least some of the H-1B workers are probably naming their own rate and it could very well be less than what the average American developer of the same skil-level would name. In this case, they are willing to work for less which is undercutting overall wages in our industry and legally, I don't believe the employer would even be held liable. Anyone who has worked for companies where they employ H-1B people are free to draw their own opinions, I would just say that if you haven't, you shouldn't assume what the government, etc is saying is correct.<p>That said, if we ""opened the floodgates"" and let anyone who wanted come here, do you not think that wages would decrease for our (and other) industries?

By this point, I had already been programming for a while, but there were plenty of students with very limited exposure to programming as well.<p>One of the projects we had was writing a text-based RPG. This was to highlight the ideas behind OOP, which we learned <i>after</i> functional programming. Initially, the idea seemed to have merit--writing a game seemed to be a fun thing to do. However, I got quickly bogged down in boring detail; it turned out that writing a text based game has a lot of boring, repetitive work for each of the cool bits. It was the most tedious project in the class overall.<p>The final project we did was implementing a Logo interpreter. This was completely different--the ratio of cool and insightful stuff to boring fiddly bits was much, much better. Also, unlike the text-based game, even a barely working final result felt brilliant. Being able to program in a language I had just implemented was magical. Playing a text-based game with a working engine but a poor story line did not measure up.<p>So far, this has been my favorite course. However, I remember the text-based game as annoying and not particularly illuminating; it does not compare at all with the logo interpreter.<p>Overall, I think that too much of a text-based game is repetitive and boring, and it relies too much on non-programming bits (the dialog, the setting, the story) to be consistently inspiring to a new programmer.",1320643507

They give a typical employee 32 hours per week to avoid being legally required to treat them as a full time employee, and they change the shifts on a week to week basis. Good employees are rewarded with more hours or better shifts, while bad employees are punished by reducing their hours or giving worse shifts. They expect you to answer the cellphone and come in to do extra shifts when they are short-staffed, and you must apply online through their website and then come in for an interview where you dress well.<p>They expect you to get there on your own which in many cities means a car is necessary. They ask if you have a car on their website application forms, and they mention that a car is not mandatory. You are statistically more likely to be hired if you display signals on the application form that indicate you are wealthy or higher class, which gives people who don't really need the job an advantage in the hiring process (such as high school students).<p>If you take sick days, they will reduce your hours to punish you, but of course will never tell you that that is why because it is illegal. But all employees understand that this is the situation.<p>For the record, I'm not in this situation. I'm one of the wealthy people who decided to work a $9.10/hour job by choice, for fun. I don't work there anymore -- early retirement. But I have lots of friends who are in this position. Usually they are there because their parents are poor and had major issues. Many of the people in these situations suffer from mental health disorders but cannot afford treatment.<p>If I'm angry at the silver spoon people on hacker news it's because I was raised to believe that technology would liberate humanity and create a world with no poverty and limited human suffering. But instead I have discovered that technology has been used by an elite to enslave the vulnerable.<p>They live tiny compartmentalized lives dominated by oppressive faceless systems that exploit them at every turn. Every injustice is accepted with resignation to the fact that the dejected human cannot even beg the system for mercy, because robots have no feelings. The bank algorithms charge $40 non-sufficient fund fees when the rent check on Monday is withdrawn, even though the paycheck was deposited Friday, because some bank algorithm re-arranges the order of the deposits to ensure there will be a fee. The worker is told not to complain about this -- when they opened the account they accepted the agreement which indicated that this could be a possibility.<p>Instead of the whips of slave-masters, faceless corporate ""policy"" and computer algorithms are the overlords that teach them their worthlessness. They are told to cheer up by the self-absorbed on HN, and they learn that it is essential that they lift up the corners of their mouth and pretend to love their slavery in order to pay the ever expanding grocery bill.<p>This is your high tech society. It's a society of faceless high tech oppression, a society where the hungry have jobs and internet but cannot afford food, a society where there is abundance but corporate policy says that only rich people are allowed to eat.<p>A society where when the dejected and pitiful complain for help, they are told to cheer up, at least they have cell phones and internet. But they can't eat their cell phone, and they also can't trade it for food.<p>For the record, most of the poor people I know do not have plasma TVs or cable. They would gladly trade their cell phones and internet for more food and shelter IF they could function in society without a cell phone or internet. But you can't. They are not luxuries, they are mandatories.",1320642402

I was just at the Google Developer conference in South Africa and the reason they cited the price increase was to force more efficient implementations, implying that the cheap pricing allowed people to be lazy. At the time I thought that was a positive spin, but it seems to have worked in this case. Good work!",1320642273

But, when you have them, you have the assurance that the code behaves as it does in the test when the same conditions occur in production.<p>The trouble is, tests typically don't guarantee to catch an <i>entire class</i> of errors. Rather, each test guarantees to catch <i>one specific case</i>, and when you write your tests you try to cover a useful number of representative cases.<p>This is not to say that executable tests don't have their place, of course, but the plural of ""unit test"" is not ""proof"". On the other hand, if you can verify a certain property totally via your type system then executable tests for that property are unnecessary.",1320642174

I managed to get them to consult some of our former safety guy's recommendations that they had apparently forgotten about and find some stuff that addressed the heat issues.  So they spent a few grand or so on swamp cooler fans to cover areas they should have a long time ago and they got some of those cheap necklaces that absorb water.  Those work much better than fans, BTW, though it can be hard to get people to wear them (ironically, I had to badger the one guy who needed one the most and he benefited more than anyone).<p>A lot of things were forgotten, I guess, because the guy responsible for safety was laid off back in 2008 or something like that, which is probably what made them seem so nervous.<p>Anyhow, no one got sick from the heat, and this was a downright miserable summer, even by Arizona standards, and we did pretty good from the look of things.

Imagine three people, X, Y and Z; and some proposition P which is true if A and B are true. Suppose X believes in A, Y believes in B, and Z believes in A and B. So vote on A: does a majority believe in A? Yes, both X and Z do. Does a majority believe in B: Yes, both Y and Z. But does a majority believe in P (which is necessarily true if both A and B are true)? No, only Z believes in P. So conjunction (i.e. the AND operator) does not hold for groups; and without conjunction, consistent logic is impossible.",1318910315

After 5 years using Haskell and a couple of years away from it, I've become convinced that the way Haskell isolates IO and state is not the correct solution.  I'm not smart enough to know the correct solution, but creating monads, monad transformers and arrows and then providing sugar to get everything to look imperative again feels wrong.  Uniqueness Types feel a bit healthier.<p>Now that I've said that, let me say that I'm most certainly impressed with the work around IO and state in Haskell because it was an amazing bit of intellectual horsepower and is an incredible step.

The project I am currently working on is already very heavy on javascript, so there is no way to do ""graceful degradation"" for browsers without javascript enabled.

If you want to do efficient IO and prevent space leaks, you have to learn about Iteratees, Enumerators and Enumeratees. If you wish to create GUIs in a bearable manner, its imperative that you learn about FRP and Arrows eventually. Then there's the innumerable amount of language extensions to Haskell of the GHC flavor, each of which comes with only scarce documentation and examples, but with a lot of theory (Fundeps, Type families, Existential types, GADTs ...). But there's more: Comonads, Kleisli Arrows and probably things I haven't even heard about. The whole point being: If you want to be able to handle 'real world stuff' in Haskell, its not enough to stay 'mostly pure' and use StateT, unfortunately.

I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say here.<p>Why would these nations need ""a monolithic MS style set up to keep them afloat""? It seems to me to be the case that a properly tailored GNU/Linux distribution would be a more user-friendly first encounter with a computer than anything from the Windows family (see OLPC, for example), and then there's the whole added benefit of not running a nation on costly, proprietary infrastructure.<p>Regarding your second point, I get the impression that you're talking with FLOSS advocates. If that's the case, then it's hardly surprising that they are more interested in promoting free software than discussing other social issues.",1318907068

But because such a potential would create an effectively infinite amount of current requiring an infinite amount of work, the magnet is unable to move.<p>Or from a ""cause-and-effect"" viewpoint, movement of the magnet induces a current loop in the superconductor, the creation of which creates an opposing magnetic force.<p>Either way I believe this is the same principle behind electric motor braking (e.g. when you short-circuit the inputs of a motor).  I believe you would also see a similar effect by dropping a magnet down a tube encircled with many (or perhaps one spiral) loop of wire -- the magnet's descent will be slowed by eddy currents in the loops.<p>Edit: Aha, this is just half the story.

I don't want to beat a dead horse too much since I usually protect my wallet when I hear folks preaching about ethics.  (Why is it that ethics discussions usually follow people's economic position?)<p>That said...  I view it as the Golden Rule.<p>Imagine you're heading to Tulane or Cal Tech or Stanford to recruit.  It's taking a day off your schedule, but it's important to bring new folks in to the firm.  You screen eighty resumes to interview twelve people, two of which you will bring back to your office for a full day of visits with your team and management.  One of the two will get an offer.  That's a lot of work.  How would you feel if someone was just using this as practice because he would want to work for you later?  If you found out, you would blacklist him from your company.<p>Imagine you are one of the students at Tulane, CalTech or Stanford who doesn't have an offer yet.  One lucky guy did.  So you are trying hard to get on the interview list at Google, because that would certainly be a great first job out of school.  Unfortunately you don't get chosen for the interview.  Who does get chosen?  Your classmate who already accepted an offer from somewhere else.  How would that make you feel?  What would you do?  Talk to them?  Talk to the company?<p>In the latter case, it's not ""Us against evil companies"" it is being selfish at the expense of one's peers.  In both cases it backfires.<p>This is about people being professional with one another.<p>Again - I don't want to rant too much on this, as most folks who lecture on ethics usually have hidden agendas.

No, bullies are not physically fit, many of them are obese children and a lot of the time the attacks are by a mob of kids and not just one strong, fit one.<p>This and homophobia are actually well related, as bullied victims are often shamed as ""fags"" and accused - by people like you - of meriting the treatment due to their weakness or effeminacy. And it is also of one piece with blaming rape victims for the way they dressed. It is all one role, that of the passive-receptive 'bottom' which society despises.",1369832108

It stands up to scrutiny because there are numerous reproducible experiments lending to its validity along with some very solid mathematics to back it up. The science behind climate change is very hard to create experiments for, however, and so we must lean heavily on computer simulated models (which, by the way, are rarely used to prove much of anything in the hard sciences). Thus, you hear a lot more about ""consensus"" than you would otherwise.",1369832075

I know this is difficult.)<p>(something along the lines of <input type='password' expose='hmac-sha1' secret='...' /> (taking the example from the Matasano article) - I grant that in the case of a server compromise this would allow this field to be a chosen secret, but as before, an <i>empty</i> secret could be noted by the browser as insecure, for example - and no, in this instance I haven't sat down and gone over the primitives for this yet to check how they would behave in the face of a chosen secret).<p>Granted this is all wishful thinking (and certainly thought upon by others before), but I'd be curious to hear criticism.",1369832036

You always want to avoid being unemployed for 6 months if possible; but there are ways of touching that up.<p>If you were in full-time school, just use that. You don't even need to lie. The truth is always better-- not because there's major risk of getting caught, but because it's always better to form relationships based on the truth, and the cognitive load of maintaining a lie will take steam out of you even if you never get caught. The ""6-month problem"" doesn't include full-time students. If you were a part-time student, maybe you can make it look full-time?<p>However, if you are stuck needing to lie, I advise the ""odds and evens"" strategy. Rank your choices 1, ..., N. Odd-numbered choices get full disclosure of the truth. Even-numbered choices get the story you want to tell.

I'm in school for drafting. Every sign and indication says if you're without a job for 6 months, you're screwed.</i><p>We can talk offline about that (michael.o.church at gmail). There are plenty of ways to hide unemployment time. Trust me, I know a lot of people who've had that issue.<p>One thing you can do is do a lot of freebie work for friends but claim they were paid gigs to capture the validation that employers seek. If you do free work for someone, you'll usually get a great reference, and they're not going to oppose saying you were paid $100 per hour to help you out. Most people know the corporate system is a lie, these days, and really have no problem subverting it. Corrupt systems make liars of everyone.<p>Where do you live?

If they catch me, all they can do is just fire me... I'm already up shits creek.</i><p>You have to be careful about that. The only person willing to broach this topic under real name (and, therefore, with some credibility) is... me. You need to be very cautious, but if you have no other opportunity than lying... go for it.<p>Most resume cheaters and liars are people in the 75th percentile of their industries trying to become 99th because they're narcissists who feel entitled to be at the top. I don't advise that. It's not worth the risk when you have a good thing going. Personally, I don't lie on my CV for that reason. However, if it's between being unemployed versus creating a new history, I think the latter is morally defensible. Just don't get caught.<p>My personal ethical stance is that there's a difference between charlatanry (claiming skills you don't have) and social status inflation (which everyone does). The first is unethical, wrong, and if you try to do it I won't support you. The second I am fine with. Changing dates and titles to reflect promotions one should have had, IMO, is in the second category. It's lying about social status, which everyone does. Just don't do it on paper.

And then at every single boot you either have to wait thirty seconds to go past a very scary warning or press Ctrl-D. Every single time you boot. If you switch back to ChromeOS, the hard disk is wiped again.<p>I would love to see HN commenters' reactions if on disabling Secure Boot, the Windows 8 partition is wiped along with any documents and files you saved locally and if you wanted Windows 8 back, it wiped your Linux partition in the name of security.",1369829170

5785773,comment,5784074,5784626,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Have people considered that ""credentials and connections"" are actually a valuable signaling mechanism?</i><p>Credentials, yes. There is <i>some</i> signal there, no doubt. There's no question that the average Yale or Harvard student is going to be better than the average X student for almost all values of X. Most people agree with this. The problem is more in society's attempts to enforce a total ordering. How would compare 75th percentile Penn State vs. 50th percentile Harvard? I actually have access to numbers on how strong students are across schools, and the 75th percentile Penn State student is a better bet. (Student quality-- work ethic plus capability-- in the Ivy League seems to be a N(1.70, 0.65) distribution by most measures; at the state flagships it's about N(1.35, 0.75), so you're comparing 1.85 vs. 1.70.)<p>Or, here's another question. Which has more positive signal? That Tom went to an Ivy League school? Or that Bob majored in math? The latter, actually. This is borne out, for one example, in LSAT performance. The average Ivy Leaguer scores about 160-163. The average math major scores 165-166.<p>Connections? No, not really meritocratic at all, because there are social connections and then there's Connections. The kind you work for aren't that powerful. The kind you're born with open doors that are closed to almost everyone else (e.g. getting VC funding without having to take risks with personal finances that only 25-year-olds can afford). Connections are powerful <i>in inverse proportion</i> to the amount of work involved in scoring them. That's what you're missing in that analysis.",1369829103

They've even admitted that they just picked that number four years ago and haven't looked at it since.<p>Just like they limit replica sets to 12 members maximum.  What if I have higher read requirements than that limitation allows?  Well, too bad.<p>I think this points at a fundamental issue with MongoDB at the design level - they don't allow end users to make any decisions about how to configure the product, even if those decisions might turn out bad.<p>Every Enterprise-level DB allows end user tuning of parameters, so clearly MongoDB isn't Enterprise-level.",1369829074

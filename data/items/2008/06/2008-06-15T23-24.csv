It's almost as if in your ideal world, everyone's comments would be accepted and passed on with glee, without any sort of counterbalance. If that's the case, the Earth would still be the center of the universe.<p>And... no one is preventing you from using the service following a down vote, it's your choice. Had your internet connection been cut off and your computer seized following a submission of a less popular or less agreed upon comment, your argument would hold some validity.",1213574339
218268,comment,218226,218226,0,0,LPTS,,,"Dude,<p>1.)  Perspective.  This isn't the same at all as saddam and has nothing to do with the first amendment.<p>2.)  This casual usage of the concept of lynching bothers me.  A lot.  I would probably fire someone who threw it around casually like this, on the spot.  Go have a conversation about it with people from the communities that actually dealt with lynching, and read a damn history book or two.  Would you say Microsoft 'holocausted' a company they bought out or drove out of business?  Fuck no.  Don't say 'lynching' in such a casual way.  It trivializes decades of horrible abuse towards an entire race of people and creates an environment where a lot of people feel subliminal racism.  You might not know anyone to point out to you just how grating things like this sound to people, or perpetuates racism, so let me.<p>3.)  Your concept of evolution is very narrow and, well, unevolved.  Evolution just deals with how a system responds to it's environment.  No restriction will stop evolution, it will just evolve around whatever change happens.  Digg evolved to blow goats, it's still evolution.<p>4.)  Stop identifying with your ideas so much.  Who cares if people downvote your ideas.  Either they are wrong, or you are.  You can learn something either way.  Maybe what you learn makes you think the community is wrong, or that you are wrong, or that you could just write better.  It's not a really a judgement on you.",1213574183

218261,comment,218146,218146,0,0,noonespecial,,,"""Going dark"" might be more acceptable to senior programmer types who already have a strong grasp of software development concept, accepted idioms, and basic coding style.<p>They seasoned expert is like likely to return after his dark period with something consistent, clearly written and mostly bug free. (Especially the troublesome design flaw bugs).<p>The junior programmer who goes dark mostly out of fear of criticism is likely to return with something that has no consistent style, mixed up idioms and likely fundamental system-wide design flaws that require rewrite.<p>The important difference here is the <i>reason</i> these two different classes of developers choose these long dark periods. The first developer wants to be free of politics, interruptions and nitpicking while he builds what he knows how to build. The second is afraid of criticism as he stumbles through unfamiliar territory hoping that if he can get it to ""just work"" it will hide his ignorance.<p>Denying the first his time might cost you something truly great that you otherwise won't be able to get. Allowing the second cheats the junior of a valuable learning experience and simply allows him to continue in bad practices, gaining <i>""experience""</i> without any real increase in know-how, thus generating the strange coder we;ve all met with ""20 years of experience in blub"" who writes unusable code.",1213573664

On my last project I went dark for about 6 months developing a configuration tool for another part of the project.  My code ended up looking nothing like the rest of the codebase, I didn't use the same approach to just about anything, but I've got to say, the tool itself is amazing.<p>I don't know if I could have built just as good a piece of software without going dark, but I do know it wouldn't have been as much fun.  For all of the differences with the rest of the codebase, my own section has a cohesiveness of design that sets it apart.  I'm actually trying to get better at staying with the pack, but sometimes I see that gnarly problem out of the corner of my eye and I just want to bolt.",1213571956

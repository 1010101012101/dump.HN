There is <i>one</i> Android SoC maker of note, and that is Qualcomm, who achieved total dominance of high end smartphones by anticompetitive behaviour.<p>Just because Qualcomm&#x27;s design achieves high clock speeds doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s a rat-race in the Android world. Since Qualcomm dominates, there is no race at all. Second, Qualcomm&#x27;s competitors are much more moderately clocked. Samsung&#x27;s, Intel&#x27;s and Nvidia&#x27;s current high end chips don&#x27;t even touch 2 GHz yet.<p>For a rat race you need rats and a race.

This automatically restricts everything on fbsrv.com to company machines on the VPN or things in the datacenter. Now when you see db1.fbsrv.com you know that it&#x27;s your database server on your private network, and none of that traffic is going across the internet.<p>You can do the same thing with subdomains (e.g. internal.foobar.com), and then tree off of that (db1.site1.internal.megacorp.com), but that gets confusing.",1411401466
8351087,comment,8349579,8350543,1,0,DaFranker,,,"> I disagree that there can&#x27;t be a measure of skill across different games. You can just look at the probability of a top X% player winning against a top Y% player.<p>Solitaire.<p>You can&#x27;t measure my probability of winning against you. This metric sucks.<p>In a more general way, while in many cases for perhaps a broad range of people stressfulness will correlate, to some nonlinear degree, with the correlation between their choice of action and their odds of achieving a goal (see what I did there, with the second-degree function and everything), the fact that this very (stress-to-skillness) correlation varies in formula from person to person leads me to believe that it&#x27;s a symptom of a different variable being more meaningful.<p>What I&#x27;m saying isn&#x27;t that stress doesn&#x27;t indicate anything, but rather that it&#x27;s not a very appropriate yardstick to measure things like fun and player engagement when the correlation between stress and skill-dependence varies so much from person to person.<p>For me, for example, time pressure and assiduousness-related pressures (remembering to always do X when Y or always do Z every time K) will far eclipse any notion of skill-dependency and impact-on-success as far as how stressful I feel is concerned. Give me a game of Chess, and I&#x27;ll be rather unstressed, despite the high skill-dependency. Put a timer, and my stress level shoots up exponentially, despite skill-dependency remaining more or less unchanged (since the time limit applies to my opponent as well, and doesn&#x27;t really change the ratio between my choices and my odds of victory).",1411401443
8351086,comment,8349973,8350959,3,0,agwa,,,"Trying to restrict the browser as a whole doesn&#x27;t work for a couple reasons:<p>1. The browser as a whole needs to have permission to do quite a few things, including reading from and writing to the filesystem (for uploading and downloading files), talking to your system&#x27;s graphical environment so it can display windows, and accessing arbitrary hosts on the network so it can access web servers.  It&#x27;s just not possible to meaningfully sandbox something requiring so much access.  Individual browser components, on the other hand, can be designed to do very specific tasks and are thus easier to isolate.<p>2. You want to protect not only your system from a browser exploit but also other parts of the browser.  A site that exploits a browser vulnerability shouldn&#x27;t be able to read your cookies for another site.<p>These reasons imply that you need to focus on isolating and restricting components inside the browser instead of the browser as a whole.",1411401421

Either some skill based challenge or puzzle and possibility to fail or at least get week score.<p>Not a game is not necessary derogatory descriptor. I love reading and watching movies, but neither are games. Comics read on phone or laptop is not a game, but you click things to turn pages and occasionally have to think to put together clues. A thing can be interactive experience (e.g. not game) or whatever and still be fine.<p>I&#x27;m ok with the fact that there will by grey zone between games and non-games.

Getting people to detach from the Fox News viewpoint (and its supporting outlets) or the other side, is very difficult.  This is even trying to discuss relative truth, as something as simple as Iraqi freedom fighter/enemy combatants/terrorist (notice I do not specify, you think what you want) death counts in a bombing or air strike.  Iraqi outlets changed the number, wire services, and later news outlets expounded on minimal wire details never recorded in official records quoting unnamed sources (and I am sorry, I simply do not believe any US news outlet has the language or culture skills or the free money for bribery to reach out to even willing Iraqi gov officials to chat all day about everything they ordain in their products. This is pure bullshit and never revealing a source is intentional, as there is none).<p>To summarize, the fundamental problem, whether you like it or not, is also breaching the &quot;other side&quot; with truth or opinion or whatever.  This media Balkanization is dangerous, and what you point out is that it is greasing the wheels of this operation.<p>So stop judging, read Aljazeera, RT, Iranian news feeds, and Chinese, Fox.  I have read it all.  You need to average out the facts and also see what opinions are being sold in the extremes, as that is the only way out of being mind-fucked in this system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rendon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rendon</a>",1411400765

It&#x27;s my personal measure of whether an online FPS is any good and there&#x27;s a distinct difference and it&#x27;s testable (somewhat objectively if you get many people to do this).<p>1. Play the game without any prior knowledge - just launch the game and play (obviously, look up the controls first).<p>Good FPS: you end up bottom of the table with negative points having killed almost no one and probably dying from environmental hazards. In team games your own team is likely to vote-kick you.<p>Bad FPS: you end up middle of the table and have managed to kill people from all over the table.<p>2. Play the game after putting in an hour.<p>Good FPS: you started contributing to the team effort and whilst still near the bottom you get in some kills. You know all the mechanics and none of the high level strategies.<p>Bad FPS: you finish the game at random positions of the table, even near the top. You don&#x27;t know all the mechanics.<p>3. Play the game after putting in 10 hours.<p>Good FPS: you consistently finish in the middle or higher up - but the point is your position is stable. People playing for the first time pose no threat to you.<p>Bad FPS: you&#x27;re still all over the place, sometimes at the top other times at the bottom and you sometimes get killed by people who are playing the game for the first time.<p>The reason it ties in to OP is that this used to be the norm in FPS games, now accessibility is king.",1411399412

I don&#x27;t see as doing them a favour, I see it as sharing it with them...<p>If you have a 250k car, you aren&#x27;t going to buy one for each of your friends, sure, but if any of them calls you asking to take it for a ride or a couple days, he has no problems giving them the keys, I honestly don&#x27;t know what else you can do to not make them resent you. He lets his friends have parties in his house (gives them the keys) when he is out on business so they have a nice place to party.<p>As for us, we open the doors of our house to anyone (Family and friends). We live in a very desirable place, where most people pay in the 1000&#x27;s to vacation there for a week or two, we open our house for them to stay there if they want (they do). This is while I&#x27;m working, so we aren&#x27;t really talking about doing a vacation together. It&#x27;s AirBnB for free if you want to call it that. We give them keys, they are free to do whatever they want. Eat our food. Basically as if it was their own holiday home. Again, not exactly sure what can be done to not be resented for it. I guess don&#x27;t invite anyone there, don&#x27;t talk about the house, don&#x27;t say nothing so people think we live in the projects?<p>As for giving money, I know for sure, even as a percentage, both me and my cousin give much more than at least all of our family members (not sure about friends as it is something I don&#x27;t talk with them about). He financially supports an orphanage (20+ kids) by himself along with other charitable works he has over there. As for us, we give to Watsi, support various children as well, among other things (UNICEF, local charitable organisation that work with poor families with newborns), and one of the reasons we are trying to save up  money is to be able to create and support an halfway house in our future. The amazing thing is, I wrote about the charitable aspects on my previous post, and I deleted it since it seemed like bragging. I had no problem with the rest, since that to me, specially when we really do try to share with our close family and friends our successes, it is a matter of joy.<p>This is what I mean though. I think people with a bit more success don&#x27;t mind sharing their stuff (in Portugal), but even so, it seems people take it the wrong way, and resent them for it. Do we resent pg and others that share their resources/time/money with ycombinator startups? No!

Kudos!<p>But I&#x27;m nitpicky; the distinguishing feature of games isn&#x27;t interactivity, otherwise every fun activity with interactivity would be a game, and I&#x27;m not sure conversations are normally included when we speak of &quot;games&quot; in this way. Games have rules, and often some kind of goal, and other things. The Art of Game Design (a book by Jesse Schell) kind of roughly approximates it by describing games as a kind of activity involving problem-solving and fun. If I&#x27;m not taking actions specifically chosen towards achieving a result (&quot;problem-solving&quot;), then I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m playing a game, even if there&#x27;s some interactivity.<p>So I&#x27;d say that the key towards quality game experiences lies more in the region of providing options to the player (actions they can take) that have an effect on the game world (resulting conversation, successful quicktime scene, dead goblin, shiny new sword, whatever!) where which option is taken lands the player in a different distance from various desirable goals (&quot;solution&quot; being what the player did to get there).<p>But there&#x27;s still a lot of fuzzyness, and it&#x27;s still very hard to even judge what parts of what games are quality experiences for who and when, and especially why.

What does set QTEs apart is that they are not, in fact, the whole game but are a sudden change of gameplay style which is gone as fast as it arrived.",1411398655

The few &quot;Buffet-like&quot; value investment managers are saying there isn&#x27;t much margin-of-safety in valuations any more. Also, other than tech, other sectors of the economy are &quot;easy&quot; to price. We pretty much know the growth of a utility company, real estate company, etc is going to be. They can only grow so fast, and the market guess within certain tolerances what it will be.<p>On the other hand, tech is one of those fairy land sectors that is not priced on any reasonable metric (profits), but instead on hopes and dreams. Until all tech becomes priced based on profits (like Apple, IBM, Google, etc) it will continue to see large investments seeking outlandish returns. Right now it&#x27;s an area where getting market share from others can happen quickly.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to grab market share from a utility (usually regulated monopoly) or a rent seeker (you need to buy the asset to rent it out yourself).

Game Over)<p>The desire to make games that are open is clearly not &quot;inherently flawed&quot;; Risk is a very open-ended game, yet I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone complaining that the way it divides the story into branching paths just boils it down to choosing the best two or three storylines.",1411398082

(1)T he first boom actually <i>did</i> get a lot right. The PC-internet revolutions was intense and did create a lot of new value. The mistake was treating it like a land grab where all major players would be established by the year 2000. (2) Scale <i>does</i> matter when we are talking about bubbles.Smaller means safer. (3) There is real revenue being generated by Google, Facebook and every reason to think it will be generated by Uber too. (4) Private money doesn&#x27;t (I hope) break the economy in the same way that public money can. If VCs go bust there are ramifications, but these markets are not that liquid. There aren&#x27;t margin calls going off and forcing fire sales. (5) War chests: The big boys and many of the up-and-comers have nice big war chests. They are obviously concerned about equity, but Facebook would be very hard to kill with a sharp decrease in stock price. Options might need to give way to bonuses, but the Facebook is no longer in the business of selling equity. They have plenty of cash. This goes doubly for Google, MSFT, Apple & a surprising number of no-rush-to-IPO mega startups like Uber , Airbnb, Dropbox Snapchat, etc. Their continued existence is not dependent on the market for tech stock.<p>Bubbles are some sort of unstable financial complex that can be brought down as soon as the equilibrium is broken. In 99&#x27; the money was ultimately coming from IPOs and public markets. When that well dried, everything went bottom up.<p>The recent financial crash was bullet on financial instrument tautologies, a system that created correlated risk. It could only continue to exist so long as everyone could maintain that the risk was much smaller than it was.<p>Think of the companies in question. Most could continue to survive if investors hid in a hole for two years, that&#x27;s robust. Smaller, younger startups would be in for hard times if investment stopped coming in, but 1,000 $10m (on paper) startups going under is a just 1,000 individual failures. This is correlated in the sense that a shortage of cash would effect them all, but it&#x27;s not systemic in that their failure would extend far beyond the investors, founders & employees that understand the risk.",1411398068

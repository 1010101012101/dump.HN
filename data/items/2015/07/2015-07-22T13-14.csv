9929642,comment,9923239,9927326,0,0,hga,,,"Based on this book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591145198"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591145198</a> and much else I&#x27;ve learned on the subject, the above story is wrong in most every particular.  Specifically:<p>&quot;Maneuverability&quot; is not the end all and be all of air combat, else we wouldn&#x27;t have, for example won the air war in the Pacific in WWII.  Energy from position (being above the enemy, or diving to gain speed) and from energy–maneuverability theory (thrust to weight ratio plus drag), see also the linked <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_specific_energy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_specific_energy</a> when combined with proper tactics can beat pure maneuverability, especially if the latter is gained at the cost of things like pilot armor and self-sealing gas tanks (Japanese Navy planes were optimized first for range, and then for maneuverability, and were crippled by nonavailability of better engines).  The classic tactic for attack is called boom and zoom; per this gaming wiki entry (<a href=""http://wiki.warthunder.com/index.php?title=Boom_and_Zoom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.warthunder.com/index.php?title=Boom_and_Zoom</a>): &quot;<i>Boom and Zoom (also known as BnZ) is the name of a play style that aims to take advantage of a high energy state to bounce the enemy, avoiding any prolonged fighting in order to conserve speed and/or altitude.</i>&quot;<p>Once you factor that in, the only bad match of the war was the F-105 and the Mig-21.  The F-105 was designed and used for ground attack, so if Migs were allowed to get at the bomb laden F-105s the results were frequently not pretty.<p>That happened a lot for a bunch of reasons, e.g. 
because the Air Force&#x27;s F-4s were still using a WWII era flying formation, which reduced their fighting power to 1/4 of the Navy&#x27;s.  F-4s were for a long time only equipped with missiles, which was very bad because the Air Force&#x27;s models of them were particularly unreliable in the field, the fact that almost all the planes in the air were ours meant visual recognition was almost always mandatory, so the intended scheme for Sparrows couldn&#x27;t be used.  Their pilots were in a 1 year rotation schedule, replacements were poorly trained, and didn&#x27;t have the floor in competence the Navy required for carrier landings.<p>By comparison, the Navy&#x27;s Sidewinders were better (both it and the Sparrow were Navy missiles, ditto the F-4, the Air Force <i>really</i> didn&#x27;t like this and that&#x27;s supposed to be one of the reasons they kept with their WWII formation, couldn&#x27;t admit the Navy was also right about that), they started out with guns + Sidewinder pure dogfighter in the F-8 Crusader, they trained for air combat (e.g. the famous Top Gun school).<p>By comparison the North Vietnamese tended to follow Soviet doctrine, which depended on precise control from the ground (which they had, since this combat fought over North Vietnam), the Mig-21 in particular was iffy for dog fighting due to terrible visibility from the cockpit (some NVAF pilots in fact preferred earlier Mig models), and they used two general tactics: for offense, hit and run, trying to get bomb carrying planes, for causing them to drop their bombs so they could maneuver was a win, and a defensive one where they flew in a wheel which was very dangerous to attack.<p>To finish, for air combat, getting in an <i>tight</i> dogfighting OODA loop represents a failure of some sort in the first place, Energy-Maneuverability Theory was an implicit thing going back to at least WWII, and unlike the Air Force, given all the limitations in place the Navy did rather well, although it tended to burn out its pilots because they didn&#x27;t have enough to rotate them, and the carrier landing requirement strictly limited getting replacements.  And OODA <i>loops</i> don&#x27;t matter for two very common and important types of &quot;dogfights&quot;, where either the target never realizes it&#x27;s under attack before being fatally wounded, or the attack forces it to abandon its mission and flee.",1437573290

9929637,comment,9928221,9929254,0,0,bodyfour,,,"The problem isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s behind the scenes, it&#x27;s what part of it is in kernel space.<p>The user of tame() quite sensibly wants to specify a simple filter based on what things they might need to do in the future.  i.e. &quot;I need to be able to loop up details about local users&quot;.  At the system-call level this implies a number of things should be allowed i.e. &quot;can open /etc/group for read-only access, can read NIS configuration files, ...&quot;<p>In the OpenBSD implementation of tame() all of these rules are <i>hardcoded into the kernel</i>.  Using LDAP instead of NIS?  Well, you&#x27;ll have to patch and recompile I guess.<p>Since ultimately the userland process is opting-in to the restrictions there&#x27;s no security reason that it can&#x27;t specify the rules to the kernel.  (Assuming here that care is taken so it can&#x27;t DoS the kernel by pushing down a billion-entry list or something)<p>Again, what OpenBSD gets right here is the API -- it <i>should</i> be as simple as possible for a process to say &quot;I need to look up users, use DNS, and read files; block all else&quot;  Making that a simple call like tame() is a great step forward.  I hope the seccomp-bpf people do something similar.<p>However, tame() should be a library function, not a syscall.  The kernel shouldn&#x27;t know or care what &quot;I need to use DNS&quot; means, it should just be told what files I can open and what sockets ops I&#x27;m allowed to do.<p>The OpenBSD implementation is simultaneously too rigid for some things (since things like plugable nsswitch.conf modules can&#x27;t work at all) and too loose to support other useful ones (per-application policies like &quot;block any attempt to open a file for writing unless it&#x27;s an append to $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts&quot;)<p>In UNIX there is a very long tradition of <i>not</i> baking policies like this into the kernel, and for good reason.",1437573231

Well audio and video could be recorded separately, and if they weren&#x27;t they are not hard to separate, and audio is much easier to edit.<p>Could the video of been edited?  Well sure it was probably at least cut for upload.  If it was edited the editor really sucked.<p>If the video was edited, why would the video be edited?  Maybe it was cut to remove something that happened in one of the frames somewhere during one of the repeats.  Maybe the audio was edited too and it was edited to more closely match the audio length (matching just as well as the video was edited).  Maybe someone started editing the video to hide something in a missing segment and didn&#x27;t finish or get to the audio before it was uploaded.<p>What other things besides editing and recording failure could explain the video issue?  I don&#x27;t know.<p>Do we have any experts here who given the available youtube video on the Texas Department of Public Safetys youtube page could do analysis on a more in depth level than watching it?

I want you to succeed (although I don&#x27;t know you, but I&#x27;ve already spend the 20 mins on looking at your site and typing this so I&#x27;m emotionally invested), so read the following with that in mind:<p>- Agreed with other poster - you&#x27;re selling premium products, you need to provide a premium experience. It&#x27;s getting there but there are many online shops that look and feel just like yours. Better photography, better navigation, ...<p>- When I click &#x27;knives&#x27;, I get a whole bunch of knives that to me are just knives. Some look prettier than others, that&#x27;s it. This was actually what held me back from buying one - even the descriptions don&#x27;t say which knife is better for what. It just says a bunch of Japanese mumbo jumbo that I don&#x27;t care about, plus a whole lot of &quot;it&#x27;s better, trust me&quot;. You need to guide people to <i>one</i> knife that is perfect for them, or at least, to a selection of 3 with a big title &#x27;pick the one you think looks best&#x27;. E.g. are some knives better for cutting some foods? Does one type need more maintenance? Are some better for bigger/smaller hands? What size do I need? Don&#x27;t make me choose, because you&#x27;ve lost me at that point. Those who already know what they want will find what they&#x27;re after anyway.<p>For example, there is one knife whose description says &quot;For newbies, or pros, the Tanaka Nakiri is a great addition.&quot;. No shit sherlock, so it&#x27;s &#x27;great&#x27; for everybody? To me this just screams &#x27;all our knives are the same, or at least we don&#x27;t know the difference, we just offer a bunch of different ones because we want to sell you the most expensive one&#x27;.<p>- The whole &#x27;Japanese sword master&#x27; mysticism isn&#x27;t doing it for me. Why would &#x27;hand made&#x27; be better than precision-machined? That doesn&#x27;t make sense, and I know that it&#x27;s a common marketing trope, but consumers are realizing - you need to <i>explain</i> what value hard-made adds, because &#x27;hand-made&#x27; is mostly &#x27;expensive&#x27; to me.<p>- Maybe international is not your target market, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything about shipping to the EU.<p>Good luck on your shop. As an aside, I have some silicone-with-magnet-inlay knife sheets that I use for my nicer knives, to keep them nice in the drawer. Maybe an idea for you to add as an upsell.",1437571313

In those, the officer was responsible for changing their own tapes and turning them in to their supervisor.

Those systems were an improvement over nothing at all, but there was always the possibility for funny business. The systems main effects were to protect officers from frivolous claims and assist them in report writing. They couldn&#x27;t stop a dishonest officer from destroying a tape, and therefore didn&#x27;t always protect people from abuse.<p>I&#x27;d like to think that things (other than the format) have improved in ~25 years, but there is no guarantee of that.

It was part of our standard contract that if the company ceased operations all clients would have received copies of the code.  This was a pretty big deal to quite a few clients as one of the biggest risks for a larger client investing in using software from a small company is lost sunk costs if the startup fails.  If the client has this type of agreement in place it is much less risky.  If the startup fails then a heavily entrenched client would request to receive the code and more often than not hire one or more of the now unemployed software developers either as employees or consultants to either maintain the software or train someone else to.<p>@frazras actually from this context since I believe it is a fairly common problem, the closed casket paid service makes a lot of sense.  What would be ideal is if it could essentially be turned into a GitHub/BitBucket (private) style service that is dead simple to use, but also acted as an escrow service.  You would need a means of tracking clients, but not allowing them access unless terms of contract were met that allows access.  Then it would also need to lock down the codebase in some manner; don&#x27;t allow repo deletes, do backup snapshots, something like this so you can guarantee the startup doesn&#x27;t breach contract.",1437570457

It must be Paul Graham's fault.<p>Perhaps PG's advice isn't all perfect, and maybe it's not for everyone, but the fact is that he has helped a lot of people, including hundreds of YC founders, and they generally seem pretty grateful. Who has this guy helped? What has he done to make the world a better place?",1218927471
278031,comment,277258,277964,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Not only are film-based cameras not expensive or hard to find, they actually outsell digital ones in the form of disposables. I read somewhere not too long ago that they outsell non-disposable cameras by over 25%. (I'm assuming those sales figures meant discrete cameras, rather than including cell-phones. I'll try to find it to check.) Interesting anecdote: my wife and I bought 25 of them for our wedding, and it seems unlikely we will buy 25 digital cameras combined in our lifetimes.<p>A lot of the reason for their popularity is cost. Disposables are dirt cheap. There's little upfront investment. Most people who can't afford a computer (and therefore would probably not spend $200+ on a picture frame) like that.<p>So right away, I'd just not worry about lower class families. You aim gadgets at middle class +. I guess my argument is that I don't see much market for a $200+ digital frame amongst people who don't have broadband. There are probably a number of people who have broadband but not wifi who might like the product, hence my suggestion to offer a bundle with a cheap, preconfigured router. (Supposedly only around 40% of broadband homes have WiFi).<p>I know what you mean about assumptions, but startups are all about making them, building toward them, then narrowing down as you collect feedback from customers. There's simply no way to collect the relevant facts, you have to start from assumptions. They could maybe do some market research, which is slow and expensive, and at least narrow down the assumptions. Or they can just aim their product at the people who can afford it and are likely to want it, and work from there.<p>So if I were them, I'd focus on building a kick ass wireless frame. Most people who have digital cameras and have experienced sharing them online will probably get it.",1218927457

(While concluding that the enthusiasm could be bottled and marketed)<p>In reality, it's about having integrity and being principled in your words and actions over time, regardless of who is listening. Ron Paul has it. Dennis Kucinich has it. Mcbama, Occain, and Barr don't have it.<p>In technology, these qualities translate into openness and transparency. Allmydata has it. Wuala does not. Openmoko kind of has it. The iPhone doesn't. Openmoko is certainly clunky (probably how many describe Ron Paul), but so was Linux in the 1.2.13 days.",1218926820

You couldn't possibly take the vulgarity out of his best stuff without rendering it, uh, flaccid.<p>Great satirists can be witty, vulgar, and highly personal all at the same time and yet come across as hilarious rather than offensive. But you'd better be saying something good or true. If you miss the mark, you're just an asshole. The trouble with this piece is not that it's vulgar but that it's mostly unfunny and drab. And the trouble with the swipe at Paul Graham is not that it's vulgar (or even that it's personal) but that it's gratuitous.<p>Edit: incidentally, your last sentence strikes me as a shrewd observation.",1218925999

It starts out with a word that generates guffaws on its own and strengthens it with imagery of slabby meatiness. The composition of the two pierces the rational mind and draws out autonomic ""laffs"" from deep within the humor cavities of our reptilian brains.<p>I just hope his startup, a web page that lists links to other web pages, does not get in the way of his truer literary calling.<p>edit: </sarcasm>",1218924079

Normally I'd prefer not to respond this way, but I've already engaged you, and I can't really let this much misinformation stand.<p>> Both have sandboxes (ActiveX since Windows 6.0, IE7), both have restricted APIs, both run native code.<p>ActiveX is a general purpose object API and has no sandbox at all. IE 7+ on  Vista+ can instantiate ActiveX controls in a weak sandbox via low-integrity mode, but to imply it's comparable to the NaCl sandbox is just comically ignorant. NaCl validates the nexe's conformance and its subset of x86 instructions before it will run it (in that way being very similar to Java and .NET CLR). And NaCl runs entirely in an outer, system-level sandbox that denies all system and object access.<p>In contrast,  IE's low integrity mode lets you read anything the user can, exposes massive chunks of the system as attack surface, and provides various writeable locations. On top of that, all non-trivial ActiveX controls in IE implement brokers which run fully outside the sandbox--something that's not even possible with NaCl.<p>> PNaCl is equivalent of silverlight which is cut down CLR.<p>Nope. And making that claim begins to underscore just how little you know about this.<p>> More performance - I doubt it. CLR+JVM is pretty much up there. The moment you add any virtualization, trap code or translation layer to native code via NaCl which you will require for security, there is going to be overhead which will knock it inline with a VM architecture. Startup time might be less - that is it.<p>Virtualization or trap layer? That's not even close to how NaCl works. It's really sad that you couldn't be bothered to read a one-page explanation of before you launched into this completely wrong-headed diatribe. Please, start here next time, so your trolling can at least be superficially informed: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/native-client/overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/native-client/overview</a><p>> Better security - that's a lie. Virtualization on any layer never gave anyone better security. It's throwing stones in glass houses. The only hard security boundary is at the MMU/page table. As NaCl grows, you will see it break.<p>Once again, premised on your total ignorance of the subject matter. Come back when you have at least a basic knowledge of the thing you're criticizing.<p>> No-one getting sued? I'm sure the EU will have something to say when no other vendor implements it and Google uses it to leverage market share, much like Microsoft did in the late 90's and early 00's.<p>I'm sure there was an attempt at making an argument in this last line, but mostly it just seems to be randomly scrambling for scary sounding words.",1343054969

However, if I were to write a custom solution it could take developer Y a while to get into it.<p>For example, I can picture how complex the Google Analytics dashboard code must be. If google invited me to work on it, I would have to learn whatever it is that they use to do stuff like that. If it used backbone, I would probably pick it up faster.

Develop something new, the work is already paid off.""<p>Not because this is wrong, but because the implication of that statement means that we're doing more wrong to the indie developers than good.<p>This is right that companies are thriving on one-off sales but from my observation the companies in question are big companies with lot of marketing muscle backing their products and not the indie developers.<p>If you think about it, you'll need to have a huge distribution to reach more and more customers and keep that recurring income you need to keep your business afloat.<p>Some companies opt to roll out updates or new version for an additional price. Some are trying to upsell some support licenses to earn more money on top of the customers who need more personal and frequent support (and possibley have the financial means).<p>I keep looking at indie developers who release great software but their price it too low, and have problem distributing it (either because this is a nice market or either because they're doing a piss job at it).<p>They sell a few hundred of copies and then sales just halt, what do you think happen next? They close shop and stop development and support on the product. The result is the same as what happened with Sparrow but in that case the developers are financially broke and need to get back to corporate life against their will.<p>Now I don't mean we need to agree to a SaaS model or something, I just say that we need to aknowledge the problem, If developers have trouble monetizing their software (but are still doing a great job at it) and then end up selling their companies to bigger companies, this is great for our eco-system.<p>It means more people will give it a try in the future knowing that if they utterly fail at marketing their products, they can still sell their companies and what they build to a bigger company who will know how to capitalize on their hard work.",1343053965

I don't own any ""assault weapons"" -- which is just a label by the way, many hunting rifles are far more powerful and deadly than an AR-15 -- but for a long time I've been in support of the broad interpretation of the 2nd amendment. When tragedies like Aurora happen, it's hard for me to rationalize my support of the 2nd amendment, because all the arguments I hear from fellow supporters sound apocryphal. The problem is, all the arguments I hear from detractors are just as bad.<p>Protection from, and ability to overthrow, the government is a pretty laughable justification for firearm ownership these days. Let's ignore for a moment the fact that gun owners would have to take a page from Al Quaeda to have any meaningful chance against even a single branch of the U.S. Military operating on their home turf. We can ignore that, because the government doesn't need force to operate as they please. Since the beginning of civilization, government has been about control, and a large part of control is money. If the events of the last 8 years haven't convinced you that the US government can do whatever they want with regards to monetary policy, I don't know what to tell you.<p>There is a solid argument to be made that guns don't kill people, people kill people. Switzerland comes close (not really, but they're one of the closest) to the US in terms of guns per person, but they're still not quite at our level. The Swiss have approximately 46 guns per person, where the US has 90 (Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_ownership_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_ownership_rate</a>). Yet, the Swiss have a small fraction (less than 1/5th) of the gun crime that we do. If you look at that list, you can see that there is either no apparent correlation between gun ownership and violence, or that data is just all kinds of wrong. I think it's the former.<p>So, let's accept that guns don't kill people, people kill people. We're left to reach only one conclusion. America is has a disproportionately high rate of murderous psychos. Let's throw away the Constitution for a moment (stop laughing, I'm serious) and look at it from a strictly rational, problem solving perspective. If you were presented with two groups of people, one group had a low rate of murderous psychos, and the other had five times the number of murderous psychos, would you arm the group with 5x the psychos? This is a serious question, and there are two schools of thought with serious answers. Both of these scenarios below grant that the measures taken will be 100% effective, which is a pipe dream, but let's play the game anyway.<p>Gun school: arm everyone. A murderous psycho is apt to think twice before going on a murdering rampage if he's certain that everyone in the room is carrying a gun as well. There is a near 100% chance that someone in the crowd will fight back and the psycho will end up dead. Even if the psycho decides to go on a rampage, they'll be stopped quickly and won't be able to harm many people.<p>Anti-gun school: make it impossible to get guns. The murderous psycho will have to resort to other means of killing people, like a knife or an axe. Because these tools are cumbersome and require a close range to use effectively, the number of people harmed is limited.<p>In reality, neither school is ""right"".<p>The gun school of thought has several problems, not including the fact that most gun owners couldn't deploy their weapon effectively, even if they had one. And no, I'm not talking to <i>you</i> gun buddy who practices at the range and in IDPA, etc. I'm talking about the statistical likelihood in a population where everyone carries, which is a necessity for the gun school line of thinking. Colorado has very permissive carry laws, but no one contested the shooter on that day in Aurora. Other problems include the fact that there would undoubtedly be collateral damage, and the fact that many murderous psychos take their lives at the end of their rampage, so the threat of death isn't an assured deterrent.<p>The anti-gun school faces the problem that there are 88 guns per 100 people in the US right now. Do you really think that this many lawful gun owners are going to just hand over their guns? Really? Stop for a moment, please.... Really? Even if they do, contraband weapons will remain a reality in the US for a very, very long time. Then we end up back at the problem that guns don't kill people, people kill people. Make guns hard to get, and people will start improvising other means. The murderer in Aurora already exhibited the ability to manufacture bombs. You can't outlaw everything.<p>So I see it this way: we have to arrive at a common goal. That common goal is not going to be outlawing firearms, no matter how obvious it seems to you or your favorite celebrity. It seems reasonable, but it's impractical and politically impossible. You have to accept it.<p>If you want to accomplish something, you have to be clear about your goals, then adopt methods that have the greatest likelihood of success. Clearly, our goal must be to reduce the amount of violence in the US. Now we must decide on the method. Taking away firearms is impractical and ineffective because A) you can't expect to reduce the number of firearms in the US on any kind of reasonable time scale, and B) murderous psychos will find other means to kill lots of people. The only rational goal can be to have a hard look at <i>why</i> there are so many murderous psychos and work together to reduce them.<p>I know lots of gun owners, and let me tell you, they're some of the most caring and helpful people you could ever hope to meet. They own a gun because they feel that it's the responsible thing to do. I have no doubt that would any one of them have been in that theater, they would have stood up, drawn their weapon and opened fire on the murderous psycho that day. That act would have surely drawn the fire of the gunman, but they would have done it anyway. These are not the people you should persecute. We should find a way to work <i>with</i> gun owners, not against them.<p>The term ""murderous psycho"" is not meant to be hyperbole or some kind of joke. The people who commit these crimes are often psychopaths, by clinical definition. They often go untreated, although not unidentified, until something like Aurora happens. James Holmes' mother was not surprised when contacted by authorities. Does this not seem like the most broken aspect of this situation? And I'm not suggesting a witch hunt for psychotics. That won't work any better than the war on drugs, or the war on firearms for that matter. We have to open up the dialogue about mental illness. We have to start talking about it as more than the punchline of a joke. A person who is sprialling out of control needs to feel comfortable that they have somewhere to go and receive help, not imprisonment.",1343053442

4281102,comment,4280741,4280741,4,0,cletus,,,"I've used Spring on and off for 7+ years now. It was a seachange for Java and I like it a lot but the Java-based configuration has a serious defect.<p>Spring supports two methods of dependency injection: constructor injection and setter injection. Guice (in comparison) favours constructor injection. I prefer constructor injection too. It means objects can't be instatiated in an invalid state (assuming you enforce preconditions) whereas with setter injection you have to rely on lifecycle methods (eg @PostConstruct) to enforce that.<p>With Java-based Spring configuration you create <i>instances</i> rather than define dependencies in terms of <i>classes</i> (as Guice does it). This is a problem for constructor injection but not for setter injection.<p>This means when you create an instance to satisfy a dependency you need to explicitly supply all the constructor arguments. Spring would otherwise figure out setter injection.<p>With Guice you associate classes instead so you don't need to explicitly call a constructor with all the arguments. For Java-based configuration IMHO Guice is much better in this regard.<p>Also, Java-based Spring configuration relies on the cglib library, which may or may not be a problem in certain environments (eg its not officially supported on AppEngine but in my experience works fine for this).<p>So if you like constructor injection you have two options: component scanning or XML.<p>Component scanning is slow. Too slow. For even a small number of objects (<100) I've reduced startup times from ~30 seconds to ~10 seconds just by switching to explicit construction.<p>XML is really the best choice here. One thing you may not realize is you don't need to specify all the dependencies in XML (setter or constructor). You simply do a definition like:<p><pre><code>    <bean class=""com.example.Foo"" />\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    public class Foo {\n      @Inject\n      public class Foo(Bar bar, AnotherBar anotherBar) { ... }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nand Spring will figure it out.<p>IMHO this is far better than Spring's Java-based configuration.<p>EDIT: to clarify, @Inject here is JSR330 DI annotations [1] so java.named.Inject not com.google.inject.Inject. As that page notes Guice now supports either form.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/JSR330"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/JSR330</a>",1343053426

Neither of these are likely to change the data or boilerplate line count of the original example, and they don't necessarily have to change the logic much either:<p>data: $('#new-status').serialize() suffices to gather all of the form data in one statement no matter how many controls there are (in a real app your service will probably need most/all of them for validation/context, and a more specific selector can be used to just gather some elements).<p>When I want to update the display based on my service response, I typically return new markup as one element of my json response. So, my success method is something like $(""#status"").html(data.markup), once I check data.status to make sure I had a successful response rather than an error. This can be extended to multiple elements by returning a list of id/markup pairs, or going all the way to a jsonp response.

Here it is in its entirety.<p>I recently launched a Kickstarter project: ( http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1402474606/the-ilex-edc-pen-and-capacitive-touch-stylus ) and have found that it is much more difficult to get people to the Kickstarter page than I had anticipated.  The project is a combination pen (either fountain pen or ball point) and capacitave stylus, with a focus on quality and elegant design. The project came about in response to my frustration with the stylus market when I bought my iPad. None of the styluses I could find felt like high quality writing instruments.<p>There has been some recent discussion on HN about Kickstarter projects, and problems with them (particularly that some proposers have pretty unrealistic ideas about what it takes to get a product to market). I've tried to avoid falling into this trap by involving my brother, who designs and develops products for a living (he's a mechanical engineer working in the knife industry). Based on his experience, we have a pretty good idea of what it is going to take to get this into people's hands in quantity, and our pricing structure reflects that. It's somewhat higher than other pen or stylus projects on Kickstarter, but not out of line with the high-quality writing instrument market as a whole.<p>Response to the project from people who have seen it has been pretty positive, and conversion rates have been okay, so I don't think there are too many problems with the product itself or with the pricing. The main problem seems to be publicity.  There are a host of manly-gear-related sites (uncrate, gear patrol, and the like) which would seem to be the obvious venues for this sort of thing, but they haven't responded to our emails. Does anyone have any suggestions?",1343053010

Take Sparrow (<a href=""http://sparrowmailapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparrowmailapp.com/</a>) for example.  They seemed to be doing well for a desktop application - so well they got acquired by Google.  An number of other applications I have purchased on my Mac are done by small teams: Alfred, 1Password, TextExpander, Things, Coda, Tweetbot. As other comments have mentioned, it may be easier on the Mac due to a perceived higher quality & richer client base.  Independent games are also doing very well.  Look at games like Braid & Limbo (true these also were XBLA titles).  Games are still desktop applications after all.<p>So yes, I'd say there most definitely is a market for desktop apps & I wouldn't be surprised if the market was the strongest it had been for a while with the rise of the Mac App Store.",1343052963

I find that there are a ridiculous number of opportunities, but they're A) pretty bad ones or B) are unwilling to pay for what the talent they claim they want.  I hate to sound so negative, but a lot of opportunities just aren't great.  It isn't working for a startup, or working on some new infrastructure in a company that does something interesting.  There's a lot of extending spaghetti code for a cost center within Cardboard BoxCo with enterprise software that's EOL'd by its vendor.  More so if you live outside one of the big tech hubs.<p>I can have 8 finals in 4 weeks and get 4 offers, but after meeting with the organizations and finding the reality is the opposite of what they advertise, that I don't want any of those jobs.  Especially at the levels of compensation they think they can get <i>anyone</i>, nevermind the top 5-10% of the candidate pool.<p>I've resorted to freelancing.  Within the first 30-minute phone call we already know where things are going based on their reaction to my hourly rate.  Additionally I figure if I hate the assignment, I know when it'll end.

I've been studying this for a while, so I get better and better at recognizing people's questions when I encounter the particular cases, but always make sure to tell them that this is what I learned from the master. Monks in today's world never wanted to learn from a living Buddha, because he never lets people tell even a little lie in front of him. Instead, the monks stay with the dead Buddha because he never scolds them and just smiles..<p>So, about the period that an Enlightened Being comes to the world, there are a couple things you need to know.<p>The first thing is that an Enlightened being only comes to the world in certain circumstances. The last one we know about is Gautama Buddha. There was no one among the religious practitioners of his day who knew the correct teaching and right way to attain Enlightenment. They all had quite varied practices and did some strange stuff. Because nobody knew, that was why he had to come teach and search on foot for 45 years for someone wanted to listen to him.<p>Gautama Buddha, after he taught, said that his teaching would stay and brighten the world for about a thousand years. The period after that thousand years is when his teaching begins to disappear. And finally, the third 'ending' period after that is when his teaching has disappeared completely. It's only when Buddha's teaching has disappeared that an Enlightened being comes to the world again to reveal the truth.",1340816151

Sure, you added some code that sends alerts. It actually does something. Well, do your customers care? Are they willing to upgrade to the latest version?

The biggest things about bandwidth, and connectivity are: reliability, latency, and capacity (in order of most important to least important)<p>Reliability:
This is things like, packet loss, how often your connectivity is impaired, etc... This will have the largest Ux impact. Most bandwidth providers will have a pretty good story about this. Typically, the delta of reliability between a $15/mo provider and a $150/mo provider doesn't actually provide any realistic differences. Don't waste your money.<p>Latency:
Although, most of the applications we'll be working on won't be sensitive to connectivity latency, it does create an upper bound of the speed of TCP data transfer. (Look at the big fat, long pipe problem). All of us have big fat, long pipes to our houses phones now. You can't do much for this than locate your datacenter well. The other thing i, you can ensure that your transit provider has good peering relationships, and transit. I would recommend  looking at the list of peers through a looking glass (bgp.he.net is a particularly good looking one).<p>Capacity: This is the question of how much bandwidth can I soak up at any given point. You shouldn't ever have to think about this problem. You're probably not going to have to scale your bandwidth faster than what your upstream already has. Nonetheless, if you're running a bandwidth intensive site, you should consider this, because you could potentially choke your upstream. They will more than likely just go ahead and blackhole you in order to preserve the rest of their revenue stream.",1340814369

I also use Visual Studio every now and again and it is all right too. I recently had to use Eclipse for the Blackberry 10 development. And boy, what a horrible, crippled environment it is! In Qt Creator I can navigate around my code in seconds thanks to an awesome locator feature. I can quickly jump to any file, class, function anywhere in the project - all through the same interface. Not to mention that being written in C++ Creator is lightning fast. Eclipse is slow to navigate in code and it is just slow.

4167624,comment,4167186,4167473,28,0,mindcrime,,,"I had a similar experience, that was at least as groan inducing. I was working a low-level IT job, as an AS/400 operator / network tech.  The ""IT manager"" was a complete fraud who knew about as much about technology as I know about the culture of ancient Mesopotamia, and she had some project she was trying to get done, involving moving some data from an old database into a new one.  OK, easy enough, right?  Well, a couple of her ""pet"" subordinates spent a couple of weeks trying to migrate this data and couldn't get it done, so they gave up.  I came into work one evening and found a fracking HUGE stack of greenbar on my desk, and then she comes in and goes ""we're going to rekey all this data into the new database over the next couple of weeks, so start chewing through as much of it as you can tonight.""<p>My first thought was ""WTF?""  My second and third thoughts were something like ""Are you f%!#ng shitting me?"" and ""You are f%!#ng braindead.""<p>So, after everyone else left for the evening, I found the machine with the old database (running Paradox 4 for DOS), exported the data to dbaseIII format (because I knew it was a commonly used and widely supported format), put it on a floppy, took it to the machine with the Access database and loaded it up.  Turns out I had to write one update query to populate one of the fields, but that took something like 5 minutes.  30 minutes into the whole thing and the entire database is finished.<p>Next day I see the ""IT Manager"" and she's like ""How much of that data did you key in last night?""  I looked at her and said ""none.""  She about blew a fuse and started yelling ""Why not, I told you to <blah, blah, blah>?""  Then I told her the whole thing was done and she's like ""But.. wait, what? But..but... <i>splutter</i> <i>cough</i> <i>splutter</i> but, but... So-and-so and You-know-who spent TWO WHOLE WEEKS trying to migrate that data and you mean to tell me you did it in one night?""<p>Of course she never forgave me for showing up her ""pets"" like that.<p>Needless to say, I didn't work at this place very long.<p>Edit: there's another fun story to tell about that place, and how this same IT manager used the AS/400 system message queue facility as a poor man's IM system, and - more to the point - used it to talk shit about anybody and everybody she worked with (myself included).  Of course this dim-bulb didn't realize that when I was logged in as QSYSOPR I could read all her messages.  So, on my last night there, I printed out copies of a few ""choice"" messages from her, and then sent a systemwide message saying something like:<p>""Foo: You should probably be aware that a QSYSOPR can read all of your system messages, and knows what you've been saying about everybody in this company.  You should probably hope that <i>somebody</i> doesn't take offense, and print out copies of some of these messages and distribute them so that <i>certain other people</i> can see what you've had to say about them.""<p>In the end, I decided not to leave the printouts to be found, but a co-worker told me a few months later that I nearly gave this ""IT manager"" a heart-attack and that she spent weeks doing damage control and trying not to get fired.<p>That was like 13 years ago, and I'm guessing she hasn't forgiven me for that either.  <i>shrug</i>",1340812918

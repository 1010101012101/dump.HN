While comments that focus <i>only</i> on the unfortunate orthography without making that connection might be a waste of time, I think using the visual representation as a symbol of the underlying problem has some validity.

You aren&#x27;t going to get people making companies in engineering simply by putting them in a room with a few arduinos and macs. And things like &quot;3 day startup&quot; completely miss the complexity that goes along with actual engineering projects and is heavily biased towards generic internet based ideas. You needs something more fundamental to get across what you are trying to do, and I think there are things on campus which are aiding in that. RoboJackets, for instance, has been rather influential in this regards. 2 of our old officers that are still in the Atlanta area are both involved in very successful startups, one of our electrical guys was at YCombinator last year working on a hardware startup, and we regularly have startup job postings go out on our email headers. I&#x27;m aiming for this to grow more, and things are slowly being put into action. I think the most fundamental thing you can do to get people to take these kinds of risks is to show them that it&#x27;s possible to succeed. I&#x27;ll be posting some stuff on the CS facebook group in the next few weeks dealing with one of our initiatives.

6121064,comment,6115727,6119314,1,0,beagle3,,,"K fits APL functionality into ASCII by selecting a smaller (but empirically, better suited) &quot;base&quot;. It&#x27;s not a transliteration of APL into ASCII.<p>e.g., the first element operator is unary asterisk e.g. &quot;<i>x&quot;, which is like C&#x27;s pointer dereference (which gets the first element ..). There is no symbol for &quot;last element&quot; - instead you use &quot;</i>|x&quot; meaning &quot;first of reverse of x&quot;. Similarly, there are no compress/expand operators; Instead, there&#x27;s a &quot;replicate&quot; operator which unifies and simplifies both (and has other uses to boot).<p>In fact, it looks like Arthur used the number of ascii symbols as a constraint for the number of primitives - which are all single characters. (They can be postfixed with a colon to force monadic comprehension, but that&#x27;s not part of the operator). As a result, K is as much notation as APL is. The domain is &quot;writing real world programs&quot; instead of &quot;expressing algorithms&quot;, and it shows, but it&#x27;s still notation that -- once acquired -- reads like math or APL.<p>> One of the reasons I abandoned languages such as APL, Forth and Lisp, languages that I used extensively for many, many years is that they became less and less practical and relevant.<p>I suspecting it&#x27;s going to make a come-back.

As annoying as it may be, there are more outlets (publishers/bloggers/articles etc) for political news than there are for hacker news. Therefore, when someone writes about his or her weekend project, there is one article; when a major security flaw is found in some piece of hardware or software, there are three articles/blog posts; and when something like news about SOPA/NSA/Snowden breaks, there are five to ten (or even more) articles/blog posts/news media pages.<p>If we generously assume that 100% of arrive on HN as submissions, then it makes sense that the distribution of submissions will weigh towards the more popular in terms of number of submissions for different articles for the same topic (visualize a histogram).<p>My solution would be to have a way to merge separate submissions that fall under the same topic (basically, one or more URLs per topic).

It frees the implementation to collect records in the most efficient fashion and from having to maintain ordering.<p>Yes, I understand the theoretical argument. I&#x27;m looking for real world examples where that actually helps anything, or theoretical examples where it is superior (in the sense that &quot;there is no way to assign order which would not move the problem to a higher complexity class&quot;).<p>> The cost is that you need to keep an index updated. A trite observation, but there it is. Sometimes that cost is worth paying, sometimes it isn&#x27;t. SQL doesn&#x27;t forcefully extract that cost, it lets the database programmer or administrator decide, based on local conditions, what is best.<p>My point is that ksql does the same -- except that in most cases, the cost is 0, so you get the order &quot;for free&quot;; when the cost is not zero, ksql doesn&#x27;t make guarantees, and you&#x27;ll need to ask for ordering, just like in sql.  Every sql engine already assigns order in one way or another (ROWID, etc.), except it is unpredictable, non-standardized, and doesn&#x27;t provide most of the benefits even though it is there.<p>And the &quot;no order&quot; default often does have a cost; e.g., if you are trying to store e.g. tax brackets in your database and find out which tax bracket a salary falls into:<p>Either you store both lower and upper bound of bracket in a record, which means you can&#x27;t normalize (and it is hard to express the integrity requirement of &quot;no gaps&quot; as a constraint) - or you do normalize, and then every query is a self join or correlated query that many optimizers won&#x27;t handle properly. Whereas in ksql, you store it normalized (just start-of-bracket), order by start-of-bracket, and then get the bin that corresponds to your question.",1375104912

Losing access to features previously found is one cause, but so is the lack of rational and <i>balanced</i> discussions explaining why the features were removed, and missing instructions on how to get similar functionality in Gnome 3, or the lack of tools to migrate old Gnome 2 applications to Gnome 3.  To take a comparing example of Gnome2->Gnome3, lets look at Python 2->Python 3 and see what the Python Software Foundation did right.<p>#1: Features removed were announced years before they were removed, with clear instructions on how to migrate to better and improved features.<p>#2: 2to3 was invented, an automatic translator for source code from Python 2 to Python 3, to make it easy for developers to migrate over to new version.<p>#3: Any feature that was removed had clear documentation and discussion that explained why it was removed, and what users could do to move forward.<p>#4: New features were back-ported from Python 3 and made available in Python 2. This allowed users to test out things from the security and familiarity of Python 2, without getting tangled in all the changes at once in Python 3.<p>#5: Python 2 and Python 3 was/is developed in parallel, giving people plenty of glimpses (and warnings) of the future, and insight over what would be future safe activities.<p>Gnome 3 did none of these things. One could argue that there were practical reasons why, but not doing any of those things will hurt a project. At any rate, I have not seen Gnome 3 give any practical reasons why they did such an abrupt move from Gnome 2 to Gnome 3, beyond that they &quot;had to&quot;.<p>(Written by a Gnome 3 user, on Gnome 3)",1375104287

Analytic services like Google Analytics or Mixpanel will work for any type of config as they&#x27;re initiated by the client. They both also have a nice UI so can see live user&#x27;s, plot them on maps, etc.<p>If you want lower level detail such as data for each user&#x27;s IP address you&#x27;ll need something on the server side. I haven&#x27;t used Mixpanel but Google Analytics doesn&#x27;t give you raw IP addresses. Also, if a user has it blocked (ex: by Ghostery) then you don&#x27;t see them in Google Analytics. To get around this we also log all requests server side.<p>The two options I know are either do it yourself (that&#x27;s what we did, more below) or use something like Piwik (<a href=""http://piwik.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://piwik.org/</a>). The latter is kind of like your own Google Analytics that you run on your own infrastructure.<p>For our public cloud app (<a href=""https://cloud.jackdb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloud.jackdb.com/</a>) we run all the infrastructure so we aggregate the server access logs from each nginx instance and push them to an S3 bucket. It&#x27;s pretty straightforward and <i>really</i> cheap (S3 costs peanuts and log data gzips well). Besides audit events (which do get logged to a database and can be queried) any funky research is done by good ol&#x27; awk/grep/sed.<p>Our public website (<a href=""http://www.jackdb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jackdb.com</a>) is hosted on S3 so we don&#x27;t even control the actual server. Instead we&#x27;ve got logging enabled on the S3 bucket sent to another S3 bucket[1]. S3 creates files there with 1-3 hour lag of all requests with full details (IP, useragent, etc). Only pain is that S3 creates <i>a lot</i> of files so we&#x27;ve got a cron job that runs regularly to combine them into daily files, gzip them, and put them in a different S3 bucket. Again ad hoc research is done via unix commands on either the latest log files or the archived files (we keep a local copy in addition to the ones in S3).<p>Regardless of how you get your logs onto S3. If you want to make the storage costs 10x cheaper in the long run (again this will only matter once you actually have a significant amount of data) then you push it from S3 to Glacier. Even better you can setup S3 to auto expire data to Glacier after X days[2]. Just remember that you can&#x27;t access them directly from Glacier. It&#x27;s just for &quot;cold-storage&quot;.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.ht...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#intro-lifecycle-rules"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecy...</a>",1375104229

Because it&#x27;s written in a man page, it&#x27;s certainly not locked away. And reading it is hardly going to extreme lengths. Man pages are precisely there to be an easy way to look something up, and are written and maintained by the community, so they certainly qualify as community curated knowledge. It&#x27;s also a much more efficient way of spreading information than a blog post. I&#x27;m not sure where you get the notion that man pages are for a select few and not for everyone. They&#x27;re also all on the web so it&#x27;s easy to search their contents as well.<p>I would take the position that anyone who hasn&#x27;t read the man page for something is a bit of a neophyte, or a novice at best. Unless perhaps they&#x27;ve read the source. How else are you going to learn something, without reading the documentation? Online tutorials and blog posts make for a poor substitute at best, and being less direct often introduce inaccuracies and other misinformation. I think it&#x27;s fair to say that someone whose entire knowledge of a subject is based on incomplete information is not an expert. Not to say that man pages are perfect; they can be outdated and inaccurate themselves. But perhaps if more people read them, more people would submit revisions to make the documentation better. If suggesting that people read the proper documentation makes me an elitist asshole, so be it.<p>I don&#x27;t quite agree with your 15-20 years timeline; GNOME and KDE were only founded about 15 years ago, and it was a few years before they matured to the point where decent windowing support was commonplace, so it wouldn&#x27;t have been a given that you would have a full GUI environment at that time. Opening and closing xterm in twm was enough of a hassle to warrant using screen to accomplish windowing instead, which is much more esoteric than ~. Using ssh from an actual console without a GUI was still pretty common at the time, at the very least as part of setting up a box to the point where it had a GUI. But that is all beside the point. ~. takes less time than closing a window/tab and opening a new one, be it through a mouse or a keyboard sequence. And it doesn&#x27;t nuke your scrollback history. This is just as true today as it was 15-20 years ago. If it&#x27;s still useful enough to vote up a post, it should be useful enough to read about in a man page.<p>More people should be like the guys who hang out in IRC help channels. If you think they&#x27;re there just to tell people to RTFM, you are very much mistaken. They are generally genuinely helpful people. However, they&#x27;re not inclined to be as helpful to people who come waltzing in demanding everything they want to know handed to them on a silver platter, when they could have looked it up themselves with minimal effort. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong to point out that there&#x27;s no place for that sense of entitlement. However when someone asks a question who&#x27;s clearly done their research but is still stuck on an issue, you&#x27;ll find the same people who normally respond with RTFM will do everything they can to help. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask to take enough consideration of their time not to waste it with something that can be answered in the first page of Google results. I would posit that instead of these people being labelled elitist assholes, a lot of people should be labelled entitled assholes instead.",1375103899

It presumes to know the reader&#x27;s mind better than the reader does; implies that familiarity is the only reason anyone ever prefers one thing over another; and assumes that all change is always good - all of which is absurd.<p>Similarly in the linked article, the author pretends that there is no objection based on the actual merits of the software: in other words, users object that the removal makes the software less useful, and the writer pretends to misunderstand the complaint as &quot;we now have n - 1 features instead of n features&quot;. He even arrogantly says that some features they &quot;shouldn&#x27;t have had in the first place&quot; - when in reality, people complain because they were using the feature for something they cared about and aren&#x27;t satisfied with the new way.<p>The really important hidden premise of apologists like this is that there are no intrinsic merits of one design over another - that it&#x27;s only a matter of style and fashion and what&#x27;s familiar, and there&#x27;s never any factor of one way being intrinsically better or worse suited to the interaction of human and device. That&#x27;s a big assumption, but once they&#x27;ve put in a huge amount of work based on it, they can&#x27;t even admit that anyone could have any intelligent objection, and defensively blame any dissent on an irrational emotional response.<p>The same observations apply in the case of Ubuntu Unity and Windows 8: the root cause of their failure is a sort of paternalism where the GUI designers disregard what users actually prefer, and can&#x27;t even admit that the preferences are based on practical workflow considerations rather than emotional reactions.",1375103548

... is really a pretty sad, small statement. If anything, government is of more importance to us because it is the hacker mentality itself that is under attack right now. The reason, I think, that so many of the recent issues have salience with this community is that what various governments are trying to do is to shut down disruptive economic and social activities, the lifeblood of the hacker community, in order to protect entrenched and well-connected interests.<p>At some point we all have to stop saying &quot;well I&#x27;m a {baker, hacker, librarian, truck driver,...}, why should I worry about these problems?&quot; and realize that this is world-altering stuff happening, and if you want <i>your</i> little corner of the world to survive, you have to mobilize to protect it, even if that means doing a little less of the things you normally do.<p>So I&#x27;m OK with more political posts, as long as something actually comes from the emotions they generate. Frankly, I&#x27;ve noticed a change in myself. Twelve months ago I didn&#x27;t care one bit about cryptography and networking, they were just useful plumbing that worked (or didn&#x27;t).

If you look at some of the other IT projects commissioned by the government, like consolidating government datacenters, those projects have all essentially failed.  Instead, as Snowden demonstrated, you have a very, sophisticated mechanism to view everything about anyone.  The programmers at the NSA are the very best of our peers.  And they are working on arguably illegal programs that have made the US a worse place.  It&#x27;s certainly a worse place for foreigners who want to use services like Google, Facebook, etc.  If I were a foreigner, there&#x27;s no way I would use those services, since I have zero protection or privacy against the NSA.

You are from a top department so you will surely get a tenure-track position, and that will materialize into an associate professor job in no time. The first time I realized that things were not that rosy was when I started applying for faculty jobs and read the book &quot;A PhD is not enough&quot;.<p>One key reason for all this pain is very simple - too much competition. If we had large institutions like the old bell labs (being funded the same way), that would create demand for fresh PhDs and reduce some of the stress.<p>Academia is also considered by almost everyone I know to be a one way gate. If you get out, you can&#x27;t come back in (unless you have achieved massive success and popularity on the outside). This is a sad state of affairs.<p>All this said, I think there are some very good results of getting a PhD. My social circle is full of ridiculously smart people. I think I&#x27;m trained to be unsatisfied until I better understand things, and I have more critical thinking today than when I started grad school.",1375102937

The purpose of the inquiry was to look at regional price discrimination against Australian consumers.<p>&quot;The Treasurys submission to the inquiry defined international price discrimination in these terms:
Geographic price discrimination occurs when a business charges different prices for the same product in two or more different locations. International price discrimination is when geographic price discrimination occurs across country borders.
To maximise profit, many businesses do not sell based simply on a mark-up of what the product cost to produce, but rather price according to what they consider the market can bear, that is, according to the consumers marginal willingness to pay.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=ic/itpricing/report.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Hous...</a><p>To my mind it&#x27;s just smart business for software makers to price their products at what the market will bare. However I think it crosses a line when sellers of &quot;digital goods&quot; build in technical geoblocking (e.g. regional website redirects, region-specific app stores) and licensing agreements which enforce consumers purchase in a specific reason.<p>The parliamentary committee was the result of certain sections of the market saying their not willing to bare this pricing tactic and looking to raise awareness amongst those who aren&#x27;t aware that it is happening.<p>Also interesting and was this earlier article from mid-way through the inquiry with a focus on Adobe:<p>&quot;At the parliamentary hearing, he said that customers can buy Adobe boxed products overseas, but that those products would not be covered by the company&#x27;s local warranty policies.&quot; - Adobe managing director for Australia and New Zealand Paul Robson<p><a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/au/adobe-to-australia-higher-pricing-is-your-personalised-experience-7000012972/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/au/adobe-to-australia-higher-pricing-is...</a>",1375102802

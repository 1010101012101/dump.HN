Sadly, this factually incorrect position about TCO is held by many and repeated often.<p>On the larger scheme (pun intended) of things, of course TCO is not <i>essential</i>, very few things are. However, the assertion &quot;you can just always use a loop&quot; is incorrect. To pull out just one example, with TCO I can have the producer-consumer coroutine for free without stack overflow. Loops are not the only use case for TCO.<p>Furthermore, there is nothing &#x27;O&#x27; about it, doing extra work (maintaining call frames) not required by the semantics is not an optimization but an act of pessimization, unless there are compelling reasons to do that extra work.

I don&#x27;t think these books are &#x27;fascist&#x27;, but they certainly don&#x27;t exactly argue with the 18th century enlightened Toryism with which the English comfort themselves so frequently in these upsetting times. They don&#x27;t ask any questions of white men in grey clothing who somehow have a handle on what&#x27;s best for us.</i><p>Google reveals a large number of people making similar points:<p><i>I love JRR Tolkien&#x27;s work, but it is racist and fairly fascistic. Most of the good guys are tall white men of the north and west, simple country farmers, and the dunedain who remain supermen even though their quality has diminished by mingling with the &quot;blood of lesser men.&quot; The dwarves and elves are also good races. The enemies are various swarming slave races, the cowardly Easterlings, the savage elephant riding painted Haradrim, the literally subhuman orcs. Those counseling peace are perfidious fools, cowards or traitors.<p>This won&#x27;t keep me from rereading The Simirilian, The Hobbit, LOTR and the Children of Hurin. But Tolkien was a man of his time and place and we should appreciate his virtues without ignoring his vices.<p>Calling Tolkien himself a fascist is quite a few bridges too far for me.</i><p>{commenter at <a href=""http://lorenrosson.blogspot.com/2006/06/tolkien-fascist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lorenrosson.blogspot.com/2006/06/tolkien-fascist.html</a>}",1438241472

This offering only exacerbates the issue by incorporating data from external sources which lack data management guarantees available in other solutions.<p>> They are such easy tools for creating, displaying and auditing calculations (like financial models), manipulating rows of similar data, and generating regular charts and reports.<p>When their use is restricted to this, spreadsheets do provide value.  The problem is that many times the spreadsheets start off as a data integration scratch pad (as it were) and then become the &quot;system of reference.&quot;<p>Used as a tool which enables one-off types of value it&#x27;s hard to argue against them (so I won&#x27;t :-)).<p>> Python&#x27;s duck typing may horrify Java programmers, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that all Python code is bad or has type errors.<p>This is a false dichotomy[1], or a straw man[2] if you prefer, as both Python and Java are general purpose programming languages.<p>Excel is not a general purpose programming language.  It is not a programming language.  It is a program which allows people to use a <i>very specific DSL</i> to benefit from it in novel ways.

One way to get to lower latency is to avoid using locks and rely on lock free algorithms.<p>Many of those are much easier to implement if you can rely on a GC, because the GC solves the problem that you can have objects that are still referenced in some thread, but that aren&#x27;t reachable from the lock-free datastructure anymore.  There are ways around this, e.g. using RCU or hazard pointers, but mostly it&#x27;s easier with a GC.",1438240069

9973493,comment,9973087,9973097,0,0,btoptical,,,"Really none of that is correct.<p>Firstly it&#x27;s not at all equivalent to an AM radio.  It is an AM modulated carrier but that&#x27;s about it.  The detection scheme direct detection and not coherent like in an AM radio.<p>Also your power spectral density would be fairly low as your AM modulation would be distributed over a huge wavelength range.  So taking a narrow slice with a tunable optical filter (which aren&#x27;t that narrow really) would mean the detector would see a very small signal indeed.<p>Given that it&#x27;s so broadband, my guess is that it&#x27;s probably not low intensity noise at all (modern communications lasers are ~-140dB/Hz) and thus wouldn&#x27;t make a great direct detection OOK source.  So this would limit ultimately the sensitivity of such an AM modulated system.  Being so broadband means that it&#x27;s not at all suitable for phase modulated signal because by definition it would have high phase noise.  Overall the spectral efficiency of such a source as a communications device is abysmal.<p>Additionally the silicon detectors that are needed to convert the light signal back into an electrical signal have low responsivity and speed.  So the poor detector speed places an upper bound on the supportable BW and poor Si responsivity places a limit on the overall sensitivity of the system.<p>It&#x27;s much, much more efficient to use IR sources all the way around.  Materials in the IR are really efficient for both light generation and detection.  There are lots of other reasons why IR is better for free-space communications as well (less scattering and higher material transparencies generally).<p>No a white laser is good for other reasons.  There are lots of places where we still use things like Xenon lamps for measurement of things.",1438240018

The concept is ...not without merit, but I think it totally sweeps the central problem (We have no idea how to program an AI) under the rug in two ways:<p>(1) The problem of programming ...programming anything at all, is swept under the rug by assuming a formalism in which every possible algorithm/program can be enumerated, and then just using brute force to go through, essentially search though all the character strings that represent implementations of any kind of algorithms, however bad they might be.<p>(2) The problem of trying to decide what we actually should want to do in complex situations is swept under the rug by just assuming that we have access to a reward function that tells the desirability of each outcome at each step.<p>So if this kind of helpful assumptions are allowed, the problem of, say, constructing a good chess program can be easily solved by the following meta-algorithm:<p><pre><code>    1. List all chess programs\n    2. Choose the best one\n</code></pre>\nThere, problem solved!",1438239857

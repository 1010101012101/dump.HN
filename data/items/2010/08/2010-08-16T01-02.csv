Just having to think about potential legal issues now or in the future where you didn't previously adds friction where there wasn't any before, which is never good.  We're also seeing a lot more interest in the CLR version of Clojure, and to the extent effort is diverted from the JVM version, to that or to ones hosted on something else, this may not be a good thing.<p>In the longer term, this quote struck me as the most apt WRT to Clojure or any other language that uses the JVM in unusual ways (particularly the GC of functional languages) <a href=""http://adtmag.com/blogs/watersworks/2010/08/oracle-google-lawsuit-hurt-java.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adtmag.com/blogs/watersworks/2010/08/oracle-google-la...</a>:<p><i>Forrester Research analyst John Rymer agrees: ""I think this lawsuit casts the die on Java’s future,"" he said. ""It will become a slow-evolving legacy technology. Oracle’s lawsuit links deep innovation in Java with license fees, and that will kill deep innovation in Java by anyone outside Oracle or startups hoping to sell out to Oracle. Software innovation just doesn’t do well in the kind of environment Oracle just created.""</i><p>As Clojure matures, we'll be wanting to do ""deep innovation"" (such as in GC) and Oracle has cast a pall on doing that in Java/JVM space.",1281923951

1606551,comment,1606159,1606519,0,0,bhickey,,,"You're incorrect. People do want to restrict inaccurate diagnostic tests.<p>The false positive rate for some Down syndrome tests runs at around 5%. True negative is around 80% (Quad test). The rate of Down syndrome pregnancies amongst 40 year olds is approximately 1%. If the quad test says that a fetus has Down syndrome, the probability that it actually does is only 14%. The story is even worse amongst younger mothers (0.1% disease incidence) -- 1.6% true positive rate. Given that the pregnancy termination given a Down syndrome diagnosis is 93% we <i>should</i> care about these numbers.<p>I can go on. Breast cancer testing in women who aren't in a risk population is similarly dangerous. Biopsies do carry small risks. Most men with prostate cancer will probably die of something other than prostate cancer. If we treat it, it often leads to urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.<p>Bad tests are frankly dangerous and should be subject to regulation.",1281923914

1606520,comment,1606159,1606301,0,0,bhickey,,,"I think the parent is spot on.<p>Just some background in brief: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP in the singular) are single base changes in the genome. Given the size of the genome (approximately 3 billion bases), the mutational rate, and the time since all modern human populations diverged from a single ancestral group (sorry, no number off the top of my head) we should expect that each position has mutated no more than once. So, for the most part SNPs come in two flavors, a minor allele and a major allele. If the SNP is associated with disease, one allele is called the risk allele, while the other is the protective. Down to business.<p>For a SNP and a disease, we can compute the odds ratio or relative risk (there is a difference) for that SNP. Suppose you have the risk allele, the relative risk is 2, and the frequency of disease is 1% -- congratulations, you have a nominal 2% chance of developing the disease. Alright, onto the problems: For most complex diseases, this doesn't help us in the slightest and is non-informative. There are a lot of markers, these diseases are rare, genetic risk might well be subsumed by environmental effects. (Good rule of thumb: Don't smoke cigarettes, don't be obese. Eat your vegetables. I'm a scientist, not a doctor.)<p>If you test someone, you'll invariably get a pile of risk alleles for <i>some</i> disease, just because there are a lot of diseases and a lot of SNPs. This will invariably cause distress in at least some people. The harm done to the subjects would clearly exceeds the benefits to them. Given the study design there's no reasonable way to obtain informed consent from the subjects <i>if</i> they're to be informed of the results. Without informed consent, you can't gather the data in the first place.",1281923124

Genetic testing is already very useful, and it's only going to get more useful.<p><i>First, there is the issue of our limited genetic knowledge.</i><p>Our knowledge is incomplete, but it's far from useless. Genetic testing lets us know what foods or drugs are particularly harmful or beneficial. It lets people know of future disease risks. Knowing about these risks helps people change their lifestyles to reduce risk, or at least plan for the future.

Now, you cannot do that since the W accumulator is bound to one of the libraries, or if you do bind multiple ones then they may conflict in odd ways.<p>But maybe that's overstating the problem, worrying too much.  Maybe it's okay that within each function we just assert that it can only use one library.  I'll think about this more.  I'm still a little worried it might be hard to explain. Do you think it'll be easy enough to describe to someone that W is both an accumulator and a library in one?<p>The dict idea would save a few characters, but it leads to problems with, for example, attributes that conflict with other arguments in the function call, or Python keywords.  Even in your own example, you put className instead of class because class is a restricted keyword.

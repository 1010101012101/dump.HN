4648100,comment,4639085,4647593,1,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>This is why Mr. McKenzie is forever telling people ""don't be a commodity.""</i><p>I've never noticed Patrick himself use that exact phrase, so I'm a little wary of putting words into his mouth here, but let's consider your point in isolation.<p>The basic principle here is that in order not to be that kind of commodity programmer, you must have some combination of skills, knowledge and resources available that is both rare and valuable.<p>Programming is hardly an esoteric skill set, and neither is being able to speak ""business"" to business people. Do these skills have value? Absolutely, often a great deal of it. And sure, not everyone in software development is a great developer, and not everyone in software development is good at communicating with non-technical people who play other roles in the wider organisation. But for the argument to work in more than a handful of exceptional cases, it doesn't need ""not everyone"" to have those skills, it needs ""almost no-one"" to have those skills. If what you offer isn't rare, chances are you're offering a commodity service whether you realise it or not.<p>In reality, there are many, many people out there with the technical and communication skills to make the kinds of high-value contribution that Patrick and co talk about. Many people do it all the time, whether as freelancers or employees. And while a lot of those people would have difficulty formally quantifying the value they offer, not least because they might be working as part of a team whose results are only measured in aggregate, I don't think the real problem is a lack of recognition from smart management (those wonderful people that consultants like to call ""good clients"") of the contributions made. That is usually only a factor if you're working for someone who really is a bad employer/client, in which case there are many employers/clients you could work with instead who would acknowledge your contribution more honestly.<p>But even in a positive environment, it is not easy to stand out and change how you are viewed. You can't just raise your rates dramatically above most other people's rates if you're working in a competitive market, which freelance/contract software development certainly is. So you have to create a new market, where the rules are different. But at that point, you're not really doing anything like freelance/contract work any more, you're building a complete new business, with all the pros and cons that come with that.<p>Now, I don't think anyone would disagree that running your own independent business is by far the most lucrative way to make money in a field like software development. I certainly wouldn't, and on HN of all places I don't have to tell anyone about the potential returns of entrepreneurialism. All I'm saying is that it's a completely different job to being a freelancer/contractor who happens to charge much higher rates and put ""Senior Consultant"" on their business card, and I dispute any general claim that the transition is necessarily either possible or in the best interests of most people who work successfully as freelance contractors today.",1350111430

That should at least get you beyond the ""introductory"" courses--hopefully more higher-level courses will be offered in the near future, too. Try taking difficult classes, regardless of whether you meet the prerequisites--if the math turns out to be too difficult, just work on the relevant math skills while you take the class.<p>I think the software world is uniquely situated to bypass a lot of the outmoded educational models that we've built up over the years, where education is 10% about learning and 90% about slapping down a degree that ""proves"" you're intelligent and capable. This makes a lot of the trappings of a traditional education unnecessary--if you take a class but don't have all the prerequisites, you don't need to worry that your grades will suffer, because your grades (if you even have them!) don't matter. If you're interested and motivated, you'll learn a ton, and that's what will matter in the end.",1350111195

4648086,comment,4647667,4647667,7,0,beloch,,,"An implicit assumption here seems to be that Apple is the one dumping Samsung when the opposite might actually be the case.  Given production requiring equal fab-space, Samsung may have higher margins on their finished consumer products (e.g. Android handsets) than on the commodity priced components it sells to Apple.  Given sufficient demand for Samsung's finished consumer products, freeing up some of the fab space currently used to supply Apple could benefit Samsung's bottom line.<p>The truth may also lie somewhere in between the two extremes of Apple dumping Samsung or Samsung dumping Apple.  Samsung might be looking to jack up the component prices Apple pays for the above (or other) reasons, so now Apple is looking for alternative suppliers.<p>It will be interesting to see how TSMC's (or Intel's) component prices compare to what Apple has been paying Samsung.  There may be some price fluctuations in Apple products over the next couple of years.",1350110633

A lot of games that fouled up bsnes' GBA emulation in the early days seem to work just fine, with the minor exception of Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night, whose intro cinematic and main-menu are both kind of glitchy (something to do with DMA timing, if I recall correctly).

4648059,comment,4647701,4647943,19,0,bruce511,,,"Govt spending is indeed all the things you mention. But disrupting it will be very hard, because it is essentially outside anything you can control.<p>We're not a startup, but we built and maintain a web site which is paid for and used almost exclusively by local govt. it's been running for about 3 years now. Fortunately it's not part of our core business (we did it mostly as a favor to a friend).<p>In year 1 we quoted a pretty low number to build, and host the original site. Because of the price level, and because of some expertise we had, it didn't need to go to tender. [1]. We built it quickly, got it up just fine, everyone was happy (including the client) so we invoiced.<p>If memory serves it took about 12 to 18 months to actually get paid. (in 3 years we've never been paid by them in less than 12 months overdue). Our actual client works his socks off to push it through, but the basic process is excessively rule bound [2]. Since we're not morons the price in year 2 and 3 has risen dramatically to allow for the administrative hassle, and delay, in getting paid.<p>We've seen companies go to the wall because of this cash flow issue. However others I've polled get paid promptly, so I don't know the criteria that gets you onto the slow track or on the fast track.<p>So it's easy to look at a trash bin and ask how it can cost $10 0000, but you have to factor in the pre-sales and post-sales costs. These are substantial and could easily be 10 times the price of the product itself. Given the cost of pre-sales, and the likelyhood of not getting the job, many companies aren't interested, which in turn limits the level of supply.<p>You're right that the bins are of a higher standard to be more durable. And the only way to know they are more durable is to test. And testing costs money. They are also possibly designed to survive extreme events (like a bomb). When growing up in the 80's (in some countries prone to small terrorist devices) it was common to either have bomb-proof trash cans, or no trash cans at all. My point is that there's a specification for them that the manufacturer has to meet and both producing to that spec, and testing for it, costs money.<p>As the tax payer we are paying not just for trashcans but for the 100% transparency that goes with govt spending. No journalist ever wrote a story on how much money a govt employee saved by taking on more risk. When they do get creative, and it fails (as by definition at least some risky options will) then the media is quick to pounce. So don't be surprised when their primary goal becomes not-to-fail and not reducing-costs.<p>[1] [2] govts are exceptionaly risk adverse. Tenders are designed to reduce their risk to really low levels, and as risk has a value it drives up the eventual price. While you may spend $20 on a trash can, and just replace it if it breaks, they can't do that. Break enough trashcans and someone will run a story on how the public money is being wasted. This is not limited to govt though, when you are spending not-your-money your goal is not to save money, but to reduce blame coming back to you. Nobody ever got fired for buying ..... ?<p>Part of the risk aversion extends to the supply chain. You may be able to supply 10 cans of the approved standard this month, and the govt goes through all the hoops to make it happen. Then suddenly you ""pivot"" and they have to start it all over again. Mostly the humans involved in the decision making process aren't interested in extra work, so they attempt to reduce the risk by choosing a bigger, more guaranteed, channel of supply.<p>Thus disrupting govt spending, especially with a startup, would be exceptionally difficult because the appetite for risk on both sides are fundamentally opposite. And of course when you say ""disrupt"" you mean to ""make cheaper"" whereas when you are spending tax money, reducing costs is simply not a goal.<p>If you want to disrupt govt spending you need to first change media, and public perceptions of govt failures, and the cost of removing ""all"" risk.",1350109096

4648050,comment,4645844,4645844,1,0,idoruby,,,"I have been meditating for forty years. For thirty nine years I did transcendental meditation (TM)as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. I sat for 20 minutes twice a day without fail.<p>Last year I switched to Vipassana not because I was displeased with TM but just for a change and because the Goenka community seems to be very professional. I have been sitting in this new way one hour a day for a year now. I am not as regular because Vipassana requires more arrangement than TM. I am satisfied with my practice and can see a path to grow in this community for the rest of my life.<p>I am not sorry that I have spent so much time meditating. It changed my life. Before I began meditating I was aware of a certain pervasive incompleteness. I am a programmer and I love programming and I have been married for forty seven years and love my wife. But these satisfactions were not enough.  My meditation practice did not materially change my life but it has given me a sense of centeredness. I am in a quiet way more fulfilled.<p>My experience was that TM was a very practical choice. I paid $75 to be initiated and found the TM community meet my needs for companionship on my path. Community is important to support a meditative practice. The actual practice is practical to do in our busy lives. If you are too busy to take two twenty minute periods each day for your personal readjustment then you are too busy and you need to readjust your life pattern. If you do not realize the imbalance in your life, probably meditation is not for you. Don't waste your time. Perhaps later.<p>YMMV, nowadays it cost $2k+ to learn TM. It is a good deal at this cost at least the benefits in my life exceed almost any amount of money. But without my experience I would never understand that. It is a chicken and egg problem.<p>OTOH, the TM community has changed and I am not sure I would be served by the Post Mahrishi community. In my case, as a long term meditator the difficulties with the community don't really affect me. Although I did consider the quality of the Goenka to support me in future.<p>So the choice of TM is a possibility for a newby. One caution, I knew many poeple who started TM and did not continue. So you are risking $2k+.<p>Vipassana is different. The technique requires more training and a greater daily investment. I sit for an hour a day. But Goenka suggests a minimum of two hours a day. And most practioners do at least one ten day retreat a year. I find this a bit much. But given that I am retired it is easily feasable. It merely a matter of commitment for me. A midlife married programmer will find this a greater challenge.<p>The introduction to Goenka's technique is charming. You do a ten day retreat at no cost to you. Their story is that adopting this practice is a serious matter. You learn the technique and then practice ten hours a day for ten days. For this learning period you live on the charity of others like a Budhist monk. Since this technique is a way of living that extends beyond just sitting, you need time to get into it.<p>I don't know how to tell which is most appropriate for you. I can just say it works for me. But I can say one thing for certain. Meditation is a practice that must be done everyday. Don't bother if you are not ready to commit to a regular practice. The benefits of meditation can not be explained. It is an experience and all that a teacher can do is give the experience and show you how to protect it. The rest is up to you.<p>I will say that meditation and psychotherapy are not mutually exclusive. For more than twelve years during the last forty I have been in therapy.<p>My final thought is that if you have a sense that your experience of life seems not quite complete, meditation can work to give you greater experience of connection.",1350108696

Or am I able to take undergrad courses in the Masters program and get a M.Sc?",1350108672

You (and Laura) should read up on rape culture and how intertwined it is with the culture of sexism in society. Theyre kind of like government debt and government spending: yes, theyre separate issues, but they influence each other _quite a bit_.<p>Also, please stop spreading the utter lie that I discounted rape against men. I never did that, nor would I. The primer is just not the right place to go in-depth on the subtleties of rape culture and how they affect men and women differently under different circumstances and at different ages. It's a primer.",1350108448

I was clicking thumbnails and nothing was happening, wasn't sure what was suppose to happen. Turns out it was just loading, but there was no indication that was happening.<p>This wouldn't be a big problem, but the entire thing seems to rely on you going very slowly and only click one at a time and wait for it to load.<p>If I click another photo during that loading period, it mashes up the photos [1]. Scrolling down while a photo is in the center also doesn't appear to work well, if I click another photo it tries to bring it up and cuts them up [2]. Looks like it could do with some more testing my friend.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/uzUl0.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/uzUl0.png</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/hqD9J.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/hqD9J.png</a>",1350108410

And probably focusing on this has something to do with connecting the two minds.<p>Probably one can do meditation by using Biofeedback (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback</a> -> <a href=""http://www.ccjm.org/content/75/Suppl_2/S35.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccjm.org/content/75/Suppl_2/S35.full.pdf</a>) but this technique of focusing on physiological functions is new. Probably mediation was practiced for at least 2000 years (Buddha teaching are dated somewhere around 500BC) or more (indian scriptures called tantras mentioned meditation techniques 5000 years ago). So in that time the most viable way to control consciously an automatic body function was to do it with breathing.<p>I never practiced constantly meditation, but I has tried once different forms. So just take this as a simple deduction based on my own observations and few readings on the subject :)",1350108388

I have seen people get fleeced by get rich quick schemes, and have concentrated on not being one of those victims.<p>Just to be clear - the strategy I'm proposing is NOT a get rich quick scheme.  It's ""create a passive income stream"", with the focus on ""passive"".  The definition of passive income is simply ""I don't have to work for this money.""<p>There are several reasons why I'm writing a book.  1. because it's not a simple strategy - it requires explanation and details.  2. I know that a lot of people here would be looking for the same solution that I have found, and they shouldn't have to go through 10 years of exploration and experimentation to find it, like I did.  3. My knowledge and time is worth money.  People who recognise that are willing to pay money to access it.<p>But the key reason why someone like yourself might pay someone like me money to learn from my book is the same reason that I have done the same for others.  Without paying for that knowledge, I would not have this opportunity to earn passive income.",1350108259

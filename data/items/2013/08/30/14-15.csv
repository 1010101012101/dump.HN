It was a base ad hominem, and I probably deserve to be banned for my behavior (if I haven&#x27;t been already - there are so many bizarre punishment methods on this site that it&#x27;s hard to tell).<p>Yet, reading what you actually have to say, I strongly feel compelled not to waste my time arguing you literally. I attacked you, because I tire of silly accounts with keyboard-warrior usernames showing up and spewing garbage defending the government with little-to-no rationality.

The NSA <i>very</i> strongly painted (in what little time they spent talking about their programs) the picture that the program was used mostly for foreign surveillance, and that blanket domestic spying was absurd, paranoid and not of interest to them. The leaks contradict this. (source: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/nsa-chief-denies-dossiers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/nsa-chief-denies-do...</a>)<p><i>Haven&#x27;t the majority of the leaks told our foreign enemies how to avoid being tracked more than anything?</i><p>No. The &quot;bad guys&quot; with half a brain were savvy to techniques for avoiding government surveillance before the leaks (source: <a href=""http://www.hstoday.us/industry-news/general/single-article/new-encryption-is-it-the-key-to-al-qaeda-s-resurgence/cd30a1be7e88931a3513d4c3c6257316.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hstoday.us/industry-news/general/single-article/n...</a>). That is, al-Qaeda, who aren&#x27;t exactly the most hi-tech organization in existence (to my understanding - please educate me if I am misinformed), are smart enough to realize that encrypting their traffic is a good idea; more organized groups caught on long ago (source: <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/110841/article.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/110841/article.html</a>).<p><i>I have yet to see any serious abuse of the NSA&#x27;s power.</i><p>Since you like name-dropping fallacies: &quot;no true Scotsman fallacy.&quot; What constitutes a &#x27;serious&#x27; abuse of power is subjective, but my ethical reasoning says that vacuuming up most Americans communications online without explicit knowledge or consent is abuse in and of itself. Further, we&#x27;ve already seen the love interest scandal, which clearly constitutes abuse (by my reasoning).<p><i>The fact that they know that low level employees were spying on potential love interests means that they have a system in place to track such abuses.</i><p>And yet, the fact still stands that they used taxpayer money to fund a system that stored all of that information on people they were supposed to be serving, misled them about how much of it they had, and then abused it. Whether or not they caught it later is irrelevant.<p><i>Leaking those kind of emails can be spun to state the opposite, when those emails are direct evidence that such abuses are tracked and presumably punished.</i><p>Moronic, illogical nonsense.<p><i>I&#x27;ve seen articles that have said &quot;what if they use this power to subvert political dissidents&quot; Well, what if they actually have checks built into this system as they have claimed and this new information proves?</i><p>So what? Does that justify having the information in the first place? I think not; I do not care that the state has the right to cut off my left arm to make cat food, if and only if a supervisory committee agrees that doing so is reasonable. The basic violation of a perceived right is the issue.<p><i>Wouldn&#x27;t that make Snowden a spy with his own self interests at heart, not the interests of the American people? Leaking piece-meal like he has is in his interests, not ours.</i><p>Yes, perhaps he is. The thing is, what Snowden is or does, is irrelevant, because I only care about his message, since the discussion is concerned with abuse of authority, and Snowden has little-to-no sanctioned authority to abuse. What&#x27;s that called when you attack the person instead of the message, AsymetricCom? Oh. Right. Ad hominem.<p><i>Look at the scope of these systems. The fact that no abuses have come up (locally) is quite telling, imho.</i><p>Once again, the concern is that these systems exist in the first place, not that no abuse has been documented.<p><i>When this same type of hardware is in the hands of countries like China, we see these abuses. Is China seeing something we don&#x27;t and just not telling us? I highly doubt it.</i><p>What China does or doesn&#x27;t do is absolutely irrelevant to the issue of the United States government&#x27;s actions.<p>In conclusion, you seem to like to act logical when it&#x27;s convenient, but abandon all signs of it when making your point.",1377874411

PHP now has good/sane dependency management via Composer, and many of Laravel and Symfony&#x27;s components can now be used outside of the main framework. Microframeworks are a pleasure to work with in PHP, which is especially nice for smaller one-off webapps.<p>Many of the recent improvements have been (very) late to the game, but they&#x27;re nevertheless welcome.  I could do without the Java-esque levels of verbosity that PSR-0 encourages, but it does seem to result in highly-maintainable code.<p>&quot;New PHP&quot; projects (written from scratch, targeting 5.3 and above) tend to be of surprisingly high quality.  As I&#x27;ve mentioned before, Laravel emerged from nowhere as a lightweight and very high-quality framework, long after the PHP community had been declared moribund.",1377874195

It amounts to much the same thing as doctor/patient or attorney/client confidentiality principles and allows free, assumed-secure speech in any environment where all parties present may not otherwise have an appropriate level of trust to be comfortable engaging that way.  In my business of contract engineering & manufacturing, we don&#x27;t create nearly as much internal IP as we handle the IP of our customers.  However, we apply our unique processes & systems to achieve the goals of our customers and if we want to discuss how we do that when engaging with potential new customers, we absolutely require NDAs.

6301974,comment,6301456,6301456,78,0,ritchiea,,,"I can speak to this. For a while in 2010 I was completely broke after leaving my first job out of college, which I hated, and having some other employment opportunities fall through. Having that little money changes your decision making process about absolutely everything. Obviously every financial decision is effected, even the tiniest purchases weigh into bigger questions like &quot;will I have enough money in my bank account to pay rent on the first?&quot; It can reach a point where you can barely purchase a soda without any stress over spending money. And at least for me who is fortunate enough that this was not a chronic way of life, one thing that weighed on my mind was how I was spending my time and whether I was doing enough to make sure I wasn&#x27;t so broke all the time. I could imagine that at some point that sort of thinking goes away and you believe poverty is a way of life. But I can think of a variety of other meta concerns stemming from poverty that could plague your thoughts.<p>Mentally poverty can be an all consuming condition. I&#x27;ve come to think of it as comparable to programming in a high level language versus programming in a low level language. If you&#x27;re financially stable you are like someone programming in a high level language who has tedious tasks like memory management taken care of for you. Whereas if you live in poverty before you can get to some of the really productive work you have some hurdles to overcome.<p>Another way of thinking of the difference between being financially stable and being poor is that if you are poor it is constantly a necessity to think about short term outcomes first so your mind gets clogged up with them. It is very difficult to get to think about your long term good because failing to properly address your short term outcomes could end in complete disaster.

With every line I write I have all of the ideas in that book running through my head.<p>Take a simple example. Braces on the same line or next line? Well, to me the answer is clearly same line (I used to prefer next line, until Code Complete, btw, I am not just using the book to justify a random preference). Why same line? Because studies show that as soon as you need to scroll a window to see all of your function, bugs go up and comprehension goes down. So, by putting the braces on the same line I can sometimes significantly improve vertical density, and thus improve the code reading experience.<p>I do not intend a brace war - please don&#x27;t start one. The point is that we can use empirical studies to guide how we code. Not just layout issues, but how we name variables, how we enter and exit loops, how we break things into functions, and so on.<p>I cannot overstate how much I value the book and the ideas contained within it.

I&#x27;m a big fan of buying the vinyl release + immediate download - and anecdotally it seems like the independent music crowd would be more interested in this than perhaps other music demographics.<p>I&#x27;m keen not to make any comments about recommendations or the breadth of music available, as I&#x27;m aware that the latter is a chicken-and-egg situation, and the former is hard to judge without giving the site a chance to learn my tastes. I&#x27;m going to give it a try for sure.<p>And now for some classic hn nitpicks:<p>* Please stop your site links from opening pages in new tabs.

Note that the German mission in Damascus is closed and you have to contact any embassy or mission outside Syria. They suggest using the embassy in Beirut. Problem is that you need to translate all paper stuff to German and I can&#x27;t estimate the time it takes.\nUsually it&#x27;s 2-10 days for visits under 90 days, it can take longer (even months) for visits over 90 days or working permits.<p>If you come for work, you need an invitation from an employer. But I don&#x27;t know how long the handling takes with the mission (they have to okay it first), especially since the Damascus mission is down.<p>Perhaps you qualify for the EU Blue Card (skilled immigrants):<p><a href=""http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/FAQ/ArbeitenLebenDeutschland/01-aaBlue%20Card%20english.html?nn=479790"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/FAQ/ArbeitenLe...</a><p><a href=""http://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/</a><p>If that&#x27;s an option, look into the conditions for studying in Germany.<p>Wish you all the best.

6301771,comment,6300923,6300923,59,0,wheels,,,"There&#x27;s a lot of bad information here on Berlin.  For context, I&#x27;m a non-EU software developer that lives in Berlin and now has permanent residence, as is my girlfriend.<p>Germany is actually one of the easiest countries to get an immigrant work visa for.  I would recommend skipping seeking asylum.  There&#x27;s a large enough job market in Berlin for developers that the work visa route will almost certainly be the fastest and least painful for you.<p>If you have a university degree, you should be able to get a Blue Card.  In fact, Germany will give you a 6 month visa to visit the country and look for a job.  Since you&#x27;re already working remotely, finding money to support yourself during that time should not be difficult.<p>The salary requirement that others list here is incorrect for software developers.  The typical Blue Card minimum required salary is 46,400/year, however, software development is an in-demand job (&quot;Mangelberuf&quot;), which lowers the minimum to 39,192/year, which is above the standard salary that you&#x27;d find for development positions at Berlin startups.<p>If you go the Blue Card route, you&#x27;ll be eligible for permanent residence in 3 years.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a university degree, you&#x27;re still in pretty good shape.  Then, in practice, what you need is a job offer (with a contract).  Your residence permit, prior to getting permanent residence, will be connected to your specific job at a specific company (though in practice this just means you have to go to the foreigner&#x27;s office to apply for a new visa when you change jobs).  This was the old system that I went through (before the Blue Card was introduced, which my girlfriend used).  Basically if you have a job offer and a reasonable salary, you&#x27;re next to guaranteed to be able to get a work permit.  I&#x27;ve never heard of a software developer having their request denied.<p>However, that system is not nearly as streamlined, so you actually usually need to already be in Berlin to apply for it.  I would recommend finding any excuse you can to come to Berlin on a visitors&#x27; visa (language course, conference, whatever) and stay as long as you can.  I think you&#x27;d be able to find a job and kick off the work permit stuff in a 2 month timeframe.<p>Going that route you&#x27;re able to apply for permanent residence after 5 years, though it&#x27;s a slightly nicer version of permanent residence than the one you get via the Blue Card route since it&#x27;s transferable to all EU countries except the UK and Ireland.<p>Official things in Germany will naturally be mostly in German, but the startup scene functions primarily in English.  It&#x27;s totally normal for job interviews and work meetings / emails / etc. to be in English.<p>If you have questions on this stuff feel free to drop me a line.

What I&#x27;m suggesting is that you have to be honest about the argument you&#x27;re making: we should take some of the principles that applied in the old context and apply it in the new context, based on sociological evidence about the parallels.<p>> I don&#x27;t see anyone here claiming that.<p>But that&#x27;s what it boils down to. You want to take something that is not, as a matter of fact, private, and have the government treat it as being private. You&#x27;re begging the question, which is: can you reasonably expect internet communication to be private? At the purely technical level, there are good reasons for answering that question in the negative: how can you reasonably expect communication to be private when you expose it to so many people over a network that&#x27;s totally not designed to keep it private? Surely mere <i>intention</i> can&#x27;t be controlling.<p>When you send an e-mail in plain text over the internet, more people have access to the contents of that message than if you had posted it in a bulletin board in your office. That&#x27;s the technical reality of how the internet works as a routed system.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s the case that you want to accept that technical reality, but for sociological reasons nonetheless indulge the fiction that internet communication is indeed private. That&#x27;s a perfectly fine argument to make. But you have to acknowledge that this is the argument you&#x27;re making, not get outraged that the government doesn&#x27;t take that premise for granted and doesn&#x27;t automatically indulge that fiction.",1377871252

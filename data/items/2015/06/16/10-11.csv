9724937,story,,,1,0,patricia71,"Anchorium 1.0 introduced for OS X",https://www.sitepenalise.fr/free-mac-seo-software-anchorium/,"Paris, France - SitePenalise, the search engine optimization specialists, today is proud to announce the release of Anchorium 1.0, a free Mac SEO app to help your business find customers online. Anchorium is most useful for individuals and businesses wanting to improve the position of their websites on Google and on other search engines.<p>Many website owners are mystified by how search engines works, why their own sites do not show up on any search results and what they should do about it. The app Anchorium demystifies the world of search engine optimization, commonly known as SEO. It clearly shows people the importance of website links and their relationship to their own websites The key in strengthening the position of websites is understanding how search engine bots analyzes and penalizes websites, and Anchorium shows users this information in easy-to-understand terms.<p>How Does Anchorium Work and Who Should Use it?\nLike many of the search engine bots, Anchorium looks at and analyzes inbound linking on websites. However, engines like Google and Yahoo do not reveal their findings. This means that Anchorium will help website owners understand how the web pages are linked together, which is important in how Google determines how much power and exposure a website receives. As most people with websites know, If a site is findable their website will receive more traffic and, in turn, that will translate in increased sales, profit, customers, etc.<p>Anchorium aims to help anyone with a website be searched and be found. Not only does it explain in plain English what is happening within the infrastructure of websites and offers suggestions for improvement, but also, Anchorium is entirely free-of-charge. There are not even any in-app purchases.<p>System Requirements:\n* OS X 10.10 or later\n* 64-bit processor\n* 1.0 MB<p>Pricing and Availability:\nAnchorium 1.0 is Free and available worldwide through the Mac App Store in the Business category.",1434452324

Also, some of my footnotes might contain information that you already know well. I apologize in advance.<p>* How do you reliably send down DNS information with just router advertisements? [0] AIUI, and the last time I checked, Debian, Gentoo, and Ubuntu Linux, and Windows 7 and earlier versions of Windows all fail to add the contents of RDNSS advertisements to their list of DNS servers to be contacted. (You <i>can</i> configure Linux to put RDNSS info in /etc/resolv.conf, but -when I was testing-, none of the Linuxes I used were configured this way out of the box.)<p>* I have my ISP-delegated /60 sliced up into a few subnets. If Comcast changes the prefix delegated to me, my subnet configuration is automatically maintained [1]. If an ISP uses only router advertisements to assign IPv6 prefixes, how can the ISP retain the ability to shuffle customer prefixes around while allowing the customer to automatically maintain his subnet layout in the face of such prefix changes?<p>* Relatedly, is there routing software that you can configure to automatically slice -say- a /48 advertised from upstream via router advertisements into /64&#x27;s that are then advertised on a LAN?<p>To directly answer the question you posed: &quot;I don&#x27;t know why an ISP would pick DHCPv6-PD over SLAAC, but DHCPv6-PD does seem to solve some problems.&quot;.<p>[0] I run my own DNS server, but others care about their ISP&#x27;s DNS information. So, the answer to this question doesn&#x27;t matter to the operation of my network, but the answer <i>does</i> interest me.<p>[1] Assume that my ISP delegates to me 2001:1:1::/48. From that, I slice two networks: 2001:1:1:1::/64 and 2001:1:1:2::/64. I specify this by saying &quot;Gimmy two networks from the /48 that I will be handed down to you. Number the first network $PREFIX:1::/64 and the second $PREFIX:2::/64.&quot; With my setup, my ISP can change the prefix it delegates to me to 2001:1:2::/48, and my network will automatically renumber itself. This is a bit of a pain for me, as I have to update DNS, but far less of a pain than having to update the configuration for the software that defines my subnets.",1434451653

Kids were building Radios and Stereos, and then studying for their Ham license and building Transmitters, etc. Many of those kids went on to a professional career in Electronics.<p>For a while there was huge interest in building small microprocessor systems, but then along came the desktop PC revolution and this attracted a completely different crowd. A distinct separation developed between homebrew electronics and computer hacking.<p>The saying, &quot;Beware computer programmers carrying a screwdriver&quot; was only half in jest.<p>So today the Hacker movement is starting all over again, but they seem completely unaware that a generation or two of Hardware Hackers already exists.<p>Me, I&#x27;m retired now. I started out as a Ham radio enthusiast, later became an RF Engineer, then went on to Circuit design and PC layout, then DSP and Assembler language in Embedded systems. But towards the end of my career I found it harder and harder to find employment as manufacturing dried up. Eventually I just gave up and retired.<p>Bottom line is that Electronics is an interesting hobby, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a career.<p>Just one further note: Lately I&#x27;ve been spending time in Asia: If you go into the smallest bookshop (eg in rural Thailand) you&#x27;ll see local electronic magazines, complete with free kits and PCBs etc stapled on the cover.

Learn the functions of a lot of different components and then come up with something that uses them together. Ohm&#x27;s law is most of what you /need/ to know to design a basic circuit. You can derive what you need with the help of V=IR e.g. voltage dividers, components in series, parallel. And you need to learn how to read schematics and datasheets.<p>The theory behind everything you do is deep if you want to venture into electromagnetism, which is IMO deeper than what you would expect from college level CS.

9724778,comment,9724131,9724363,0,0,netcan,,,"The &quot;food quality&quot; argument (as it is put above) or really any argument claiming that caloric accounting is only  a part of the picture basically say:<p>It&#x27;s a lot more complicated than that. Even if is caloric accounting is true in the sense that you could control weight gain/loss via caloric surpluses/deficits (pretty hard to deny) this does not account for why caloric surpluses are so common.<p>A daily surplus of just 100 calories per day (~4% of daily total) will  earn you an extra kg every couple of months (7000 calories per kg), 5-6 per year. Being off by in your &quot;calculations&quot; by this much will take you from underweight to obese in a few years. How then, do the many people who don&#x27;t fluctuate their weight wildly manage to balance out their caloric input/output without precisely measuring their food. In fact, even highly disciplined people who weigh and record every bite could be off by 100 calories just because of inaccuracies in labeling. If your lemons are more caloric than the average lemon, you&#x27;re screwed.<p>In the context of intentional and highly disciplined rapid changes in body size (like dieters or body builders) the caloric accounting method works. Add/remove 500 calories per day to add/remove about a pound per week, all else equal.<p>It&#x27;s obviously &quot;true,&quot; but just as obviously is not a complete picture. The relevance is contextual and practical. IE, body builders and crash dieters should and do reference it. A parent trying to make sure their kids are healthy does not.<p>We don&#x27;t really understand metabolism enough to have real science based answers to our questions. That&#x27;s why I think all these accusations of &quot;bro science&quot; are silly. There is no alternative. Referencing caloric accounting is attractive because it can be lab tested and it works in a lab, but labs control for other factors (like apetite). That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a complete picture. It&#x27;s relevant only to the extent that you can mimic lab conditions in your life.<p>Just like caloric deficit is true when isolated, so are other ideas that get thrown around. Hyper-palatable processed foods. Sugar addiction. Carbs. Insulin responses and appetite. Glycemic indexes. Gut flora. The carb/insulin people are interested in how food affects appetite.<p>I&#x27;ll give you an example just to demonstrate how little we know. Say you take a morbidly obese individual and have them lose 100kg of weight, they have a capacity to regain that weight in a very short period much faster than anyone who has never been obese. A regular person usually cannot gain 25kg in a year. Biggest losers do it regularly<p>The same is true of body builders (power lifters, rugby players, etc). If they lose their 25 kg of &quot;excess&quot; muscle, they will often be able to regain much faster than anyone starting from scratch. IE take two 75kg guys with 15% body fat. One was 90kg with 10% body fat 5 years ago. Have them both exercise and diet hard, racing to put on 10kg of muscle. Use trainers to &quot;control&quot; for experience as much as possible. The ex body builder will leave the other guy in the dust.<p>I&#x27;ve heard this called &quot;cellular memory,&quot; &quot;muscle memory&quot; (which is already takes, so rude) and such. But naming it does not mean we understand it. We don&#x27;t have any kind of understanding of how or why this works. We just don&#x27;t know.<p>This is why diet debates, especially among HN-like intellectual crowds can be annoying. Everyone has their tidbit of &quot;scientifically proven&quot; knowledge, but the truth is that we&#x27;re in the dark ages. It&#x27;s like geology before plate tectonics or biology before darwinian evolution.",1434449100

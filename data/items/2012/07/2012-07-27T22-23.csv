You are paid to judiciously <i>use</i> all of the above, not regurgitate the standard implementation. Which is not to say that your efforts are entirely wasted - there is value in deep understanding of the fundamentals, but it is an insufficient parameter for employment.<p>> <i>""Wrote several built-in linux commands and other commands (i.e. tail, ps, pstree, etc.) from scratch using only the linux kernel and system calls.""</i><p>See above. Rewriting shell commands is <i>really, really, really</i> far from, say, engineering a highly scalable e-commerce platform that can take literally millions of hits per minute.<p>The problems we work on in private industry is <i>way</i> harder, way bigger, and way more involved than reimplementing select, discrete pieces of Linux. We also do it in teams, so your lone gunman bit won't exactly work out.<p>This is the problem we run into when interviewing hardcore academics - so many John Wayne-types who have never worked at production-scale, who have never experienced the full breadth of <i>building a product</i> (as opposed to simply write working code), who trivialize the endeavor, and then find themselves overwhelmed. Computer science is only a <i>tiny sliver</i> of what a software engineer has to do in his day to day.<p>> <i>""If this isn't enough experience, then I must be living in a fantasy land.""</i><p>Welp, sorry to burst your bubble. It's insufficient. You could've spent all of that time interning for software companies and your odds will be <i>much, much</i> better. To be fair though, there are a <i>lot</i> of your peers who don't even have said projects under their belts, so you're far from scraping the bottom of your peers.<p>Experience, experience, experience, this is mantra we need to repeat at every new CS student. Code is only a tiny part of your day in the private sector, your mastery of the full scope of being a software engineer is <i>far</i> more important.<p>> <i>""but many of these projects (ones with arduino and linux) could qualify.""</i><p>Unless these projects were shipped to users (whether it's the public or a client), and unless these were done as part of a team, they really won't. The benefit of open source experience is less about the <i>open source</i> part, and more about having been exposed to how a real, product-shipping team operates.<p>Lone-wolf open source projects are, of course, of some value, since it serves as a reasonable work sample, but it does not eliminate the need for team software experience, which is the real benefit of joining an active open source project.<p>> <i>""Go figure, they know a lot about algorithms that the programmers probably just use API calls to do.""</i><p>They know a lot <i>about</i> the algorithms, but they have no fucking clue when it comes to implementing and applying this in a real-world context. And sadly, shipping product is what makes money, knowledge of algorithms is not an end, it is a means.<p>> <i>"" I mean I'm talking extreme no-no's (i.e. magic numbers, lack of enum use, lack of comments, no early exiting loops, god objects etc.) stuff that I actually got marked down for in my college assignments.""</i><p>Here's the trick: these are minor problems in the grand scheme of things. Which is to say, <i>you can fix</i> a programmer that has bad style, but you cannot fix one that just doesn't know WTF is up. I <i>will</i> hire an excellent engineer with mediocre code style over a mediocre engineer with excellent style. One helps ship a product, the other will write perfect code that has trouble proving relevant IRL.",1343429890

It was (in my opinion) complete nonsense by somebody who clearly has an axe to grind.<p>I have seen over 100 of Khan's videos.  On many occasions he was able to clearly communicate a topic that I had been gated on.  Doing so in a clear, concise manner.  I have colleagues at work that use Khan to help their children through Math.  If Khan had existed when I was in university, it would have eliminated 90% of the tutors costs associated with things like linear algebra.  So, as I read his criticism, I was asking myself, WTF - this feels like it has _nothing_ to do with the content that I've viewed, which has been _excellent_ in explaining topics that very few (if any ) of the lecturers I had in High School/University were capable of doing.<p>What it actually reminded me, was of Encyclopedia Britanica's FUD against Wikipedia when it was coming out.

Not evil.<p>But, judging by your understanding of how the stock market and IPO system works, it's pretty clear you have very little sense of finance, let alone how banking or the Federal Reserve system works.  The fact that you cited Inside Job as your source reveals where you get your information from.  Don't worry, you're not alone. There's a whole sub-culture out there that refuses to accept the fact that there is no banking  conspiracy, that the Fed's motivations are clear and their actions are documented.   90% of the goings on in the financial world can be explained simply and logically.  Big banks are out to make money, and how they do so is pretty straight forward.  The Fed guys are academics, not evil geniuses.  Have you ever listened to Bernanke's talks?  The guy is as meek and nerdy as they come.  Is that a clever ruse?<p>I hang around enough forums to know that it's very unlikely that you're willing to have your mind changed.

It isn't some implicit agreement.  When you pitch to investors usually 2 of the most common questions are ""What is your growth plan?"" and ""What are your exits routes?"".  If you project to be a 10MM/yr business in 5 years, VCs probably won't pull the trigger, and if you told them 100MM/yr in 5 years you can understand why a VC would maybe think you aren't moving fast enough if you're an order of magnitude off that number.<p>As for YC companies, as I've heard many time on HN when there is a post about an investment or an exit, it's all about the terms and where the company is, however it seems from reading his essays like PG's advice is to be aggressive about taking money when you can get it, so that may permeate down to the YC companies so you could be right.",1343429683

Several things have surprised me:<p>* The sheer number of teams who joined up (300+ worldwide and 100+ in SF): There are a lot of people who are eager to participate in a startup incubator.<p>* The motivation, ability, and intelligence of the people I've met: These are the smartest and hardest-working people I've encountered in years.<p>* The power of self-inflicted group pressure to drive productivity: I consider myself highly self-motivated and productive but I stepped up my game knowing my peers were reviewing my performance via the nReduce weekly video check-in tool.<p>nReduce is a work-in-progress and I think we all realize Joe Mellin and Josh Schwartzman are making it up as they go along. I heard someone grumble that they didn't get pizza and beer at every weekly meeting. They missed the big picture. nReduce is a social experiment that is taking flight because there's a need and desire for startup aspirants to join together for mutual aid. It styles itself an incubator, it's a big meetup, it's an online social network. I see it as something more, though, as a unique form of social organization for smart people who are helping each other create businesses that deliver value.",1343428992

If you are a mostly sedentary computer worker, the lack of blood circulation from sitting all day is going to make you super tired and slow your brain down. If you're a more active person, either from daily exercise, standing up at work, or a more physically strenuous job you're going to have more maintained energy levels as your body consumes and uses food and pumps blood harder.<p>Caffeine in either of these situations is going to enable your body to squeeze out more energy but for the person with more active blood flow and metabolism it's probably going to be overkill and they'll be able to get through the day without constant yawning. On the other hand, if you sit for 8 hours you're going to feel almost extreme tiredness towards the end of the day especially if you over consume for lunch.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that if you want to have a good energetic, drug free day, you should be taking steps to eat well and keep your blood flow up.<p>Also, when considering the effects of drugs on your body, all anecdotal evidence, like this comment, should really be regarded with extreme scrutiny if not disregarded all together.

Look at amphetamines, for example; at large doses they have a large tolerance effect and are highly addictive. At small doses the tolerance effect is smaller, and they are non-addictive, yet still therapeutic against disorders like ADHD.<p>It's reasonable, therefore, to suppose that there should be a ""sweet spot"" for caffeine use, where the tolerance you build is small, but the effects are still significant.<p>It's also worth mentioning that ""tolerance"" is not an all or nothing thing. With nicotine and amphetamines, there is a tolerance effect, but some of the effects of those drugs actually become <i>stronger</i> with regular use (and this is believed to play a role in the formation of addictions to those substances)[2]. So while tolerance and withdrawal are real problems, it is a myth that addicts merely return to the baseline in all respects when exposed to the drug they're addicted to.<p>In any case, if you are bothered by caffeine side effects, you might want to get some theanine. It's cheap, relatively flavorless, and when used in a 2:1 ratio with caffeine, it's been shown to reduce the side effects of caffeine[3], while adding some other cognitive benefits besides what you get from caffeine alone[3][4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091305788901797"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/00913057889...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592678"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592678</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006208"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006208</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988</a>",1343428272

I must have went to the wrong college then or you're interviewing the wrong people. Yes, there is a reason UML is used. Its used because its a standard. Its used because its unambiguous if you know it. Its used to identify relationships, areas of repeated code, state of objects in your code, and it can easily be used to generate code, if it is learned and used properly. I have yet to see any software development book or methodology that doesn't use some form of UML knowledge. Unless you code with no design.<p>> Your school projects do not in any meaningful way approximate a real software project in the real world. Your design docs are held to a completely different standard than real design docs, and the process by which they are synthesized, iterated upon, and approved is also either completely absent in academia or heavily bastardized.<p>Likewise, programming exercises you see your typical CS or engineering program are incredibly simplistic compared to what you would run into the real-world once you're hacking on production systems at-scale. This is why open source experience is valuable, but class projects are not.<p>Here is what I've done as part of my CS degree:
- Wrote linked lists, binary search trees, graphs, stacks/queues, and most of the well know sorting and
searching algorithms used everyday by programmers
FROM SCRATCH.
- Wrote my own linux shell, complete with scripting
interpretation, variable substitution, I/O redirection,
and most of the features you find a normal bash shell.
- Wrote several built-in linux commands and other commands (i.e. tail, ps, pstree, etc.) from scratch using only the linux kernel and system calls.
- Designed a new calendar system for my university using the agile development methodology with all documentation produced (i.e. SRS, UML documents, requirements etc.)
- Wrote a lexer and compiler, with a partner, for a made up language.

4303788,comment,4301729,4301729,1,0,dtsingletary,,,"Thanks for mentioning the Klout API docs (<a href=""http://developer.klout.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.klout.com</a>). They're a work in progress, but we lean heavily on Mashery's I/O Docs solution for self-documenting response and request formats. I continue to work on expanding out more detailed docs, but I generally feel strongly that API docs should be entertaining and tell a story. This aligns fairly well with how Dwolla (<a href=""http://developers.dwolla.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.dwolla.com/</a>) aimed their portal at both business and developers.<p>As an aside, we use Swagger internally to manage and self-document here, and then I/O Docs on the third-party developer side. It's a nice separation of concerns.",1343426426

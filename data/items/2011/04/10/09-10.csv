They're good at getting speakers and creating a forum to get to know each other.  With YCreject.com, I want to complement those efforts and take those organized groups to the next level.  YC does a good job at putting their companies on a pedestal and tell the world to ""look at us"".  Given this small grassroots project over the upcoming summer, I'd like to take 5 groups and place them on a similar pedestal so that investors and the press can see who they are and foam at the mouth.",1302428730

I gave it a try reading on my mobile phone on train rides. As it turns out this is a very well written (!), entertaining, witty different take on the whole Harry Potter universe. Harry Potter actually is the ""atheist misantropic know-it-all"" (yes, I am using wrong words, sue me) but the story is not. It actually evolves around his struggles with himself because of those character traits. It is very exciting, funny and as I said, professionally written.

I graduated from an ECE program (with a focus on VLSI and comp arch) in 2003, but went straight to software after that, so this was a great refresher for me, as well as explaining some of the newer stuff that hadn't been in use then.  I especially liked how he explained how caches work, and the different types (direct-mapped vs. n-way associative).  I remember it took me a while back in school to really grok caching, but the explanation here was clearer than anything I ever saw in class.<p>Overall I was most impressed by the discussions of the pros and cons of each of the designs and the various tradeoffs involved.  Often the ""why did they do it this way?"" is left out.<p>Heh, perhaps I just read it faster because I have some familiarity already, but I got through it in about 45 minutes.",1302427468

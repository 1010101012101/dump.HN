I hope the original author will realize that hanging on to his anger will only perpetuate the crimes committed against his daughter.  His characterisation of permanent damage done to his daughter makes me wonder if she will ever be able to escape the trauma <i>in his eyes</i>.  Will he be able to provide a safe place for her to go where people know about her past but care only about her present?  If <i>he</i> thinks of her as having limited potential for the future, how will she escape that past?  She needs a father, not an avenger.<p>It&#x27;s amazing the damage people can do chasing justice.",1436327994

By providing people with no choices are we creating underground networks? To me there are echoes of drug prohibition here. I go fucking crazy thinking about my kids getting taken. When I watched true detective i was seriously ready to throw up. Particularly chilling was the last line: &quot;we&#x27;ll never get them all&quot;.

9849740,comment,9849360,9849360,0,0,MarkMc,,,"For a taste of what Chinese investors are going through I highly recommend Galbraith&#x27;s &quot;The Great Crash 1929&quot; [1]. He gives fascinating insights into to the mania and crash of the market and the futility of the authorities to prop it up. Here&#x27;s an excerpt:<p><i>The worst continued to worsen. What looked one day like the end proved on the next day to have been only the beginning. Nothing could have been more ingeniously designed to maximize the suffering, and also to insure that as few people as possible escape the common misfortune. The fortunate speculator who had funds to answer the first margin call presently got another and equally urgent one, and if he met that there would still be another. In the end all the money he had was extracted from him and lost. The man with the smart money, who was safely out of the market when the first crash came, naturally went back in to pick up bargains. The bargains then suffered a ruinous fall. Even the man who waited for volume of trading to return to normal and saw Wall Street become as placid as a produce market, and who then bought common stocks would see their value drop to a third or a fourth of the purchase price in the next 24 months. The Coolidge bull market was a remarkable phenomenon. The ruthlessness of its liquidation was, in its own way, equally remarkable.</i><p>The rumors in China about malevolent foreign influence on the market also echo the 1929 crash. Galbraith again:<p><i>What was perhaps the last word on the policy of reassurance was said by Simeon D. Fess, the Chairman of the Republican National Committee: &quot;Persons high in Republican circles are beginning to believe that there is some concerted effort on foot to utilize the stock market as a method of discrediting the Administration. Every time an Administration official gives out an optimistic statement about business conditions, the market immediately drops.&quot;

If a telco gives a local business e.g. 100 numbers, and when those numbers call out it says &quot;Whatever business, 123 main street, somecity&quot; you&#x27;d just see the VoIP provider&#x27;s info each time a scammer calls you.<p>Right now you can often determine the address/owner of a telephone number, but that doesn&#x27;t tell you who REALLY called because the VoIP company never passes on that info even to the telcos.<p>What we need is a law that forces VoIP providers (inc. Skype) to forward some real caller ID info onto the telcos, and then the telcos need to forward that info to the end user.<p>The insecurity of the caller ID system (i.e. it is trivially spoofed) is a legitimate problem however, since even if the VoIP provider did pass on the info, the scammer could override it.",1436327911

Nobody has actually identified them as such.If you think of it, before google map,facebook,Uber,wikipedia etc... nobody actually knew that we needed those. The problems were there, just that nobody though of them as problems or nobody could anticipate the magnitude of the value that solving those problem would provide.<p>I think the guys from Y combinator (or is it from the book zero to one) say it perfectly : &#x27;Which company nobody is building...&#x27;.Nobody is building them not because of the lack of resources, but because nobody have found a way to identify them. So to answer your first question, nobody knows how to reliably and repeatedly identify interresting problems.<p>As you i have been think about this question quite a bit lattly, here  my though so far :<p>1 - The difficulty of identifying worthwhile problems can be though as a form of uncertainty, so learn about strategies to deal with uncertain environment. Zero to one, lean start-up and anti-fragility all treat this subject from different angles : in a nutshell, forget about find the right problem, start multiple small projects, iterate fast, be flexible, invest small and kill then unsuccessful project quietly.<p>2 - The other strategy is to leverage your particular expertise to identify problem in your domain. Depending on your domain, you might stumble into a niche problem which can generate a a lot of value for yourself (since you would have less competition)<p>Hope it helps",1436326703

       await something()

   def something():
       # ... stuff ...
       await something_else()
       # ... more stuff ...
</code></pre>
and you refactor `await something_else()` into a new method then you&#x27;ve changed the return type of `something` from `Awaitable[ReturnType]` to just `ReturnType` and `important` <i></i>will break at run-time<i></i> when it tries to `await something()`.<p><pre><code>  [1]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#importance-of-async-keyword</code></pre>",1436324623

Throughout history, nations have sought more territory because most wealth came from land and its use. Annexing territory was the fastest way to grow the tax base.<p>Controlling territory but not extracting wealth is pointless. The U.S. doesn&#x27;t extract wealth from its foreign bases; in fact it injects wealth because the bases are paid for by U.S. dollars but the downstream spending goes into the local economy.<p>And you might think &quot;well the U.S. extracts the wealth through trade.&quot; But trade is mutually beneficial (unlike taxes) and the U.S. runs a foreign trade deficit anyway.<p>The things that the U.S. gets for its projected power are peace and stability. These are things that benefit any nation, though.",1436324581

Her book The Year of Magical Thinking has to be one of the best memoirs of the last 100 years; it perfectly takes you through the intersection between self indulgence, grief and healing in a single, very tough year for the author.<p>You can feel her insecurities in it, and you can see some of the same ones in this essay 40+ years earlier, the &quot;Will I/won&#x27;t I/Can I Be?&quot; and the shot at writing about it from an &quot;I&#x27;ve made it now, I can think sagely about it&quot; angle, but at a very young age.<p>In the end, she&#x27;s a hugely important American author who simply cannot resist namedropping repeatedly in the memoir of her grief over her husband&#x27;s death; like most of us, she carries some of her gremlins through much of her adult life.<p>I think this essay is so fitting an essay for this site; it sort of reminds me in a way of Sam Altman&#x27;s sage advice at 30 -- much of it brilliant -- but still written by someone with a lot of life left to live.<p>Ms. Didion had a lot of the same drive, insecurity and needs that drive the founders in our industry; she turned out some remarkable work; I hope that we as a group will too.",1436324438

Even pre-NeXT there were compilers/runtimes for Atari, Amiga, Mac, DOS/Windows, Unix, QNX, and probably a bunch of other systems I am not aware of.<p>When NeXT shared their compiler patches and runtime (after some GPL-prodding), Objective-C became part of gcc and available on pretty much any supported platform, especially after the GNU-runtime delivered a portable messenger ( objc_msg_lookup()()  vs. objc_msgSend() ).<p>That's the language itself, but you also need to consider the frameworks implemented in it.<p>NeXTSTep itself was, of course, ported to Intel, HP-Precision architecture and SPARC.  Compiling for other architectures was as simple as checking a box in Project Builder.  Later there were OPENSTEP-compatible implementations on Windows and Solaris.<p>The grand-daddy of the open-source implementations is, of course, GNUStep, though there are a bunch more that have been around for a while such as libFoundaton and mgstep.

And actually I don't think it's necessary to consider any subset of words.<p>The usual way to find a Nash equilibrium is with linear programming. But for that you have to construct a matrix of size #(deterministic strategies for player 1) * #(deterministic strategies for player 2). Player 1 does not have so many stategies (just the number of words in the dictionary) but player 2 has an enormous number of strategies.<p>So something else is needed. We can try to write an algorithm for finding expected value of the the optimal counter strategy to when player 1 is playing a mixed strategy, let's call it ev(s) where `s` is a game state. Then we would have ev(s) = max_{s' in successors of s} ev(s'). Perhaps this can be done using dynamic programming, but it could lead to far too many states being evaluated. If you could give an approximated upper bound then perhaps some of the paths could be discarded early. Anyway then the Nash equilibrium is to minimize this ev over all mixed stategies of player 1, i.e. all probability distributions over the words. How one would do that is another tricky question.<p>One positive news is that we can consider each word length separately, as the final Nash equilibrium would always choose a word of the same length for player 1, i.e. the optimal strategy for hangman would always choose a word of size n (but we don't know n yet, and n will depend on the dictionary).",1333102896

I don't know about Angry Birds Space, but I assume they still use the same physics engine. However, they might have modified the lib to facilitate non-uniform gravity. As far as I know, they haven't contributed the changes back. Not that they're obliged to (by the license) but it would still be polite after making millions using that library. Or at least give credit to Mr. Catto.<p>Second is the ""frictional force"" mentioned in this article. As a hobby I do physics simulation code, I've done several gravity simulations. In order to get a stable simulation you need a very nice numerical integration method (I've used one called Runge-Kutta-Nystrm, but there are others that work, maybe better). Game physics engines typically have a different kind of numerical integrator that is supposed to give stable results when lots of objects are stacked and colliding. I think that the source of the frictional force in AB:S is, in fact, the numerical error introduced by the integration method.<p>Different numerical integration methods have different error characteristics, e.g. the RKN method I've used ""leaks"" energy over time, so orbits decay over time.

8829621,comment,8826060,8828875,0,0,munificent,,,"That starts to look fairly complex to me. In code that I&#x27;ve looked at, doing numeric iteration is actually not that common. The majority is just iterating over collections. Wren&#x27;s grammar for loops is actually really simple. It&#x27;s just:<p><pre><code>    for (<variable name> in <expression>) { ... }
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s it. Note that there&#x27;s no special support for numeric ranges. Instead, &quot;..&quot; and &quot;...&quot; are just regular operator calls. The number type implements them to return a range object. That lets you do:<p><pre><code>    for (n in 1..10) { ... }
</code></pre>
But also enables:<p><pre><code>    var range = 1..10
    for (n in range) { ... }
</code></pre>
And even:<p><pre><code>    var items = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;]
    var slice = items[1..2]
</code></pre>
Making the range a first-class object lets you get a lot of mileage out of using it in different places, which is nice. In fact, a range derives from the sequence base class, so you can also do:<p><pre><code>    var evens = (1..10).where {|n| n % 2 == 0}</code></pre>",1420250288

You do still have to declare them. I&#x27;ve thought about adding something similar to Wren. Since fields are already syntactically distinguished, it could be as simple as:<p><pre><code>    class Customer {

I tried to come up with an explanation of why I think they were meaningfully different by an appeal to mathematical analogy, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s convincing.<p>Fermat argued as follows: a positive integer solution to `x^4 + y^4 = z^4` could always be converted into a smaller such solution, and you can&#x27;t produce ever-smaller positive integers forever, so there weren&#x27;t any such solutions in the first place.  I&#x27;d say that this is clearly an infinite regress (though it was actually called infinite descent).<p>On the other hand, consider the problem of subtracting 1.  In the system of ordinary (not-necessarily-positive) integers, this leads to a (non-paradoxical) infinite regress; whereas, in the system of integers modulo some fixed positive integer, it leads to a (non-paradoxical) circularity (where repeatedly subtracting 1 from a number will eventually yield that number itself).

8829585,comment,8825750,8826009,0,0,dllthomas,,,"So, for an interesting example of <i>using</i> monads, consider parser combinators.  I&#x27;m basing this loosely off of the parsers provided by the parsec package, but simplifying a bit.<p>Let the type &quot;Parser a&quot; represent a parser that produces an &quot;a&quot;, after consuming some (or no) input.<p>(In Haskell, lowercase letters are used for polymorphic types;  Parser Integer is a parser that produces an Integer, Parser String a parser that produces a string, and so on.  Any concrete value will be of some more specialized type, but functions can work on the polymorphic version if they don&#x27;t rely on it being something more specific.)<p>Note that parsers may also fail, and give up on parsing further input, instead returning information about how it failed.<p>To run a parser against some input, we can do something like:<p><pre><code>    case (parse someParser inputString) of
        ResultFailure errorString -> do something with error string
        ResultSuccess value -> do something with value
</code></pre>
where<p><pre><code>    parse :: Parser a -> String -> Result a

    data Result a = ResultFailure String | ResultSuccess a

</code></pre>
We can put together a lot of things of this type.  The simplest returns just a fixed thing and doesn&#x27;t even look at the input.<p><pre><code>    return :: a -> Parser a

</code></pre>
So the expression,<p><pre><code>    parse (return 5) inputString
</code></pre>
would reduce to ResultSuccess 5, regardless of the input.<p>We can also have things that return the next character, whatever it is:<p><pre><code>    anyChar :: Parser Char

    parse anyChar &quot;f&quot; -- ResultSuccess &#x27;f&#x27;
    parse anyChar &quot;7&quot; -- ResultSuccess &#x27;7&#x27;
    parse anyChar &quot;&quot; -- ResultFailure &quot;premature end of input&quot;

</code></pre>
Or we can have something more restricted, like...<p><pre><code>    oneOf :: [Char] -> Parser Char

    abc = oneOf [&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;]

    parse abc &quot;a&quot; -- ResultSuccess &#x27;a&#x27;
    parse abc &quot;d&quot; -- ResultFailure &quot;unexpected &#x27;d&#x27;&quot;

</code></pre>
And we can have more sophisticated things:<p><pre><code>    natural :: Parser Integer

</code></pre>
So now... where does &quot;monad&quot; come in?<p>Well, when we go to build a new parser out of these components, we need some way of combining them.  We can do our parsing explicitly...<p><pre><code>    parseWithLeftovers :: Parser a -> String -> (String, Result a)

    parseTwoIntegers input = case parseWithLeftovers integer input of
        (_, ResultFailure errorString) -> ...

        (input2, ResultSuccess int1) -> case parseWithLeftovers whiteSpace input2 of
            (_, ResultFailure errorString) -> ...

            (input3, ResultSuccess _) -> case parseWithLeftovers integer input3 of
                (_, ResultFailure errorString) -> ...
                (_, ResultSuccess int2) -> return (int, int2)

</code></pre>
It should be plenty obvious why we don&#x27;t want to do <i>that</i> every time.  Let&#x27;s factor out the boiler plate.  The question is what that looks like...<p>What if we set it up so those results could be collected and passed to an arbitrary function?  That could let us write something like...<p><pre><code>    parseTwoIntegers = (,) <$> integer <*> (whiteSpace *> integer)
</code></pre>
While you may not understand the symbols, I expect you&#x27;ll agree that&#x27;s quite a bit more readable.<p>But that still doesn&#x27;t actually require monads.  <$> is a synonym for fmap, the two operators containing asterisks are from Applicative.  Can we do everything we might want with these, without getting crazy explicit and chaining parsers by hand again?<p>Well, let&#x27;s look a little closer at what&#x27;s going on above.  Specialized for clarity, the above operators have the following types:<p><pre><code>    (,) :: a -> b -> (a, b)

        tuple operator - takes two arguments, makes a tuple out of them


    (<$>) :: (a -> b) -> Parser a -> Parser b

        &quot;fmap&quot; - applies a function to the result of a
            parser, making it into a parser that does the
            same thing but returns the modified result

    (<*>) :: Parser (a -> b) -> Parser a -> Parser b

        &quot;ap&quot; - takes a parser *producing a function*, and a
            parser producing a value, and gives us a parser
            that applies the function to the value

    (*>) :: Parser a -> Parser b -> Parser b

        Takes two parsers, runs both, returns the result of the second

</code></pre>
Walking the above expression from left to right, we see...<p><pre><code>    (,)                 :: a -> b -> (a, b) -- tuple operator


    (,) <$>             :: Parser a -> Parser (b -> (a, b))
        note that the partial application of (,) *inside* 
        the parser gives us a parser returning a function


    (,) <$> integer     :: Parser (b -> (Integer, b))
        we&#x27;ve picked our &quot;a&quot; and are left with a parser
        returning a function - a job for &quot;ap&quot;


    (,) <$> integer <*> :: Parser b -> Parser (Integer, b)
        It should be reasonably apparent how the bit in
        parens reduces, so skipping ahead...


    (,) <$> integer <*> (whiteSpace *> integer) :: Parser (Integer, Integer)
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s easier - and not wrong - to think of &quot;f <$> ... <<i>> ... <</i>> ...&quot; as &quot;apply this function to these wrapped values, giving me a wrapped result&quot; - but the above is <i>how</i> that happens, and following it is a bit necessary for this next bit...<p>What if we want to write<p><pre><code>    readNChars :: Parser [Char]
</code></pre>
where the parser first reads the number of characters to read, and then reads that number of characters?<p>Looking at the above operators, there&#x27;s something that the function <i>arguments</i> (wrapped or not) have in common: none of the function arguments <i>return</i> a Parser.  So the functions can&#x27;t dictate <i>what is parsed</i>.  That&#x27;s what we fix next:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) :: Parser a -> (a -> Parser b) -> Parser b
        &quot;bind&quot; - takes a parser, and a function that 
        returns a parser, runs the first parser, feeds the 
        result into the function, and runs the resulting
        parser
</code></pre>
This, then, allows us to say things like:<p><pre><code>     parseCountItems :: Parser a -> Integer -> Parser [a]
     parseCountItems p i = sequence (genericReplicate i p)

     readNChars :: Parser [Char]
     readNChars = integer >>= parseCountItems anyChar

</code></pre>
Haskell programmers <i>care</i> that it&#x27;s a monad for three reasons.  First, communicative value - the pattern comes up a lot and it&#x27;s useful to be able to quickly convey what&#x27;s going on.  Second, there are actually a number of useful functions that can be applied to <i>any</i> monad.  For instance,<p><pre><code>    mapM :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
    filterM :: Monad m => (a -> m Bool) -> [a] -> m [a]
    when :: Monad m => Bool -> m () -> m ()
    foldM :: Monad m => (a -> b -> m a) -> a -> [b] -> m a
</code></pre>
Finally, do notation.  Haskell provides some syntactic sugar that turns<p><pre><code>    do
        statement1
        var <- statement2
        statement3 var
</code></pre>
into<p><pre><code>    statement1 >>= \ _ -> statement2 >>= \ var -> statement3 var

</code></pre>
The above &quot;readNChars&quot; could be rewritten:<p><pre><code>    readNChars = do
        cnt <- integer
        sequence (genericReplicate cnt anyChar)


</code></pre>
Do notation can often be clearer for complicated monadic expressions.",1420249163

8829545,comment,8826060,8827502,0,0,twic,,,"I&#x27;ve come to subscribe to a school of thought that says a constructor should never do anything other than assign its arguments to fields. Perhaps validate them, i suppose. But not compute with them - if you want to do computation for the creation of an object, write a factory method.<p>For me and my fellow disciples, it would therefore be really nice to have a constructor syntax that does this implicitly. So instead of writing:<p><pre><code>  class Customer {
    new(customerNumber, name, address) {
      _customerNumber = customerNumber
      _name = name
      _address = address
    }
  }
</code></pre>
We could just write something like:<p><pre><code>  class Customer {
    new(customerNumber, name, address)
  }
</code></pre>
Or, if you like Scala:<p><pre><code>  class Customer(customerNumber, name, address) {}
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m a Java programmer by day, and some thoroughly depressing fraction of the lines of code in my codebases are of the form:<p><pre><code>  private final AmazingObjectOfSomeKind amazing;
  private final BrilliantObjectOfSomeOtherKind brilliant;
  private final CrappyObjectOfAnyKind crappy;
  public Foo(AmazingObjectOfSomeKind amazing,
             BrilliantObjectOfSomeOtherKind brilliant,
             CrappyObjectOfAnyKind crappy) {
    this.amazing = amazing;
    this.brilliant = brilliant;
    this.crappy = crappy;
  }
</code></pre>
Users of other languages quite rightly point and laugh at me for this. Now, Wren doesn&#x27;t have those types cluttering up the place, nor does it have the field declarations, but it does still have unnecessary verbosity, and that verbosity provides crevices for bugs to hide in (add a parameter to a constructor, forget to add a corresponding assignment). It might be nice to add a dash of syntactic sugar to eliminate this problem.<p>Another facet of this school&#x27;s approach is that objects are generally immutable. So instead of:<p><pre><code>  class Account {
    withdraw(amount) { _balance = _balance - amount }
  }
</code></pre>
We would write:<p><pre><code>  class Account {
    withdraw(amount) { new Account(_balance - amount) }
  }
</code></pre>
(Although in fact, a bank account might be one of the cases where we wouldn&#x27;t do this, but never mind)<p>That gets old as soon as you have a few fields. Like:<p><pre><code>  class Account {
    withdraw(amount) { new Account(_accountNumber, _sortCode, _balance - amount, _accountType) }
  }
</code></pre>
There&#x27;s another bit of Scala sugar that is nice here - an automatic copy method which takes keyword arguments to override particular fields. Like:<p><pre><code>  class Account {
    withdraw(amount) { copy(balance = _balance - amount) } // other fields implicitly copied
  }
</code></pre>
Might something like that might be useful enough to justify its weight?",1420248161

8829486,comment,8825750,8826160,0,0,phamilton,,,"In Scala they are heavily used. Future, Try, Option and List are all monadic. I find Options to be fairly easy to understand and pretty useful. An example:<p>Suppose we want a function that returns C = A + B, but only if A and B both exist. Otherwise C cannot be set with a meaningful value.<p>In an imperative language (python-esque?)I might do something like:<p><pre><code>  if A != NULL && B != NULL:
    C = A + B
  else:
    C = NULL
</code></pre>
in Scala:<p><pre><code>  val C = for {
    a <- A
    b <- B
  } yield a + b
</code></pre>
What&#x27;s the difference? In this example it is largely syntax, but let&#x27;s do something with C.<p><pre><code>  D = [1,2,3,4,5]
  E = []
  if C != NULL:
    E = [x*C for x in D]
  else:
    E = D
</code></pre>
So now we&#x27;ve got some complex logic. If C is set, then we want to multiply every element in D by C and assign the result to E.<p>Without monads, I have to explicitly check for C == NULL before doing anything with it. The compiler isn&#x27;t going to enforce that so it&#x27;s possible I forgot to check and I segfault or NPE. Here&#x27;s the monadic version:<p><pre><code>  val D = List(1,2,3,4,5)
  val E = (for {
    c <- C
    x <- D
  } yield c*x).getOrElse(D)
</code></pre>
With an Option monad, I must use C inside the for comprehension. This is enforced by the compiler. If C is None, then c<i>x won&#x27;t execute and the for comprehension will return None. `getOrElse` on None just returns whatever was passed in, which in this case is D.<p>So what did we gain? Again, it might just look like syntax.  We swapped an `if C != NULL` and and `else` for a `c <- C` and a `getOrElse`. We actually gained some strong compiler guarantees.<p>Sort of a basic example and it might not be completely straightforward at first, but in my opinion once I understood how to effectively use monads (like Option and Try in Scala) my ability to simplify complex logic and be confident that it was correct increased.<p>EDIT: Haha... I botched my final scala example. That doesn&#x27;t compile... something like:<p><pre><code>  val E = C.map{c => D.map(_*c)}.getOrElse(D)
</code></pre>

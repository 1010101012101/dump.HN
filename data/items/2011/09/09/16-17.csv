I read snow crash after some of his later stuff and it's almost hard to believe it's the same author.""<p>This happens with more writers (and other artists) than many people think. I read Carlos Ruiz Zafn's <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> and <i>The Angel's Game</i> and loved both: they're incredibly rich and detailed yet driven by plot; they have the action that a lot of unsophisticated readers crave and content that can still satisfy someone who's read 10,000 novels. Oh, and it made me laugh out loud.<p>U.S. publishers are now releasing his young adult novels. Two so far, two more to come. And they're <i>terrible</i>. Almost unreadable bad. No plot, cardboard characters, wild improbability poorly embedded in a paranormal universe. You can see flashes of his later skill, but his early stuff is lousy.<p>I said this in another comment, but I'll say it again here: I just started reading David W. Galenson's <i>Old Masters and Young Geniuses: The Two Life Cycles of Artistic Creativity</i>, (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691133808/sr=8-1/qid=1315091347?ie=UTF8&tag=thstsst-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691133808/sr=8-1/qid=13150...</a>), which is where Malcolm Gladwell stole / sourced his <i>New Yorker</i> article ""Late Bloomers - Why do we equate genius with precocity?""

Galenson says that there are two basic modes for artists to follow: the experimentalists who try many things over long periods of time and eventually reach fullness, and the ""conceptual innovators"" whose sudden insight into a field fuels their work, which is often done at a young age. Under your reading, Stephenson would be the ""experimentalist.""",1315587520

Adobe were very quick to publicly criticise Apple for not supporting Flash in iOS, and Apple were very quick to respond with equally stern comments. So I think the author is correct to frame it in those terms.<p>As for the article, I think it's very balanced. Yes, this is a ""win"" for Apple, because Adobe have adapted to iOS, not the other way around, and Adobe have been very clear on this issue. They wanted iOS to support flash.<p>But the article also goes on to say that this is a big step forward for Adobe. Which it is, and that's a positive comment for Adobe.<p>And finally,<p>""we support Flash is a pretty decent incentive for the average consumer who isn't caught up in the HTML5 vs. Flash war""<p>Wh.... wh..... what?",1315587392

Issues I see on a daily with new Twitter:<p>- There're a lot of little weird inefficiencies if you use the keyboard - for instance, if you expand a tweet, space bar no longer works to continue scrolling down the page unless you tap over.<p>- Scrolling can be slowwww. Can't scroll back more than 3 hours or so in my timeline, without getting an infinite loading animation or no option to continue viewing at all. This was especially a pain for me when I was on PDT, it meant I basically couldn't catch up with the early EDT news unless I switched to my mobile client.<p>- ""You've already tweeted that."" ""Sorry, we couldn't X, please try again later."" and so on...<p>Then there's the search overhaul, which actually bummed me out a lot more:<p>- Now, search results continually default to ""Top"" instead of ""All,"" requiring a manual change.<p>- Tweet translation's been removed. :(<p>- Interface suffers the same issues (infinite loading spinner) that plague the new Twitter interface. The old search interface was really stripped down and fast.<p>I love Twitter, it's been super-important to me both personally and for my business; but I really would pay a subscription fee to get some efficiency back into my daily morning Twitter routine (i.e., ++scroll-speed, at least 48 hours of search history, bring automated tweet translation back, multiple account support). $5/month would be a serious bargain, especially considering these features would give me an extra hour or more back every day.",1315587369

Galenson says:<p><i>There are many common misunderstandings of the history of art, but perhaps none is more basic than the confusion over what determines the quality of art. Although it is of course possible to consider separately the quality of a number of different attributes of an artist's work, the overall importance of art is a function of innovation. Important artists are innovators whose work changes the practices of their successors; important works of art are those that embody these innovations. Artists have made innovations in many areas, including subject matter, composition, scale, materials, and technique. But whatever the nature of an artist's innovation, its importance ultimately depends on the extent of its influence on other artists.<p>It should immediately be noted that the importance at issue here is not the short run-interest that gains an artist immediate critical or commercial success, but the long-run importance that eventually causes his work to hang in major museums and makes his contribution the subject of study by scholars of art. These two types of success have often coincided, but in many cases they have not. {Galenson ""Masters""@2}</i><p>There are many possible values a work of art can have, of course, and Galenson is only making clear the set he most plans to consider in his work. Nonetheless, I find his argument intriguing, and I also wonder how many of the works listed in the OP contain some major innovation or innovations then used by other science fiction writers.<p>On a totally unrelated note, it'd be nice to have HN hyperlinks so one doesn't have to put URLs in parentheses.",1315587236

Our revenues from ads have roughly halved, but there are the odd anomalies in eCPM rates. For instance, yesterday was pretty stellar at a $17.7 eCPM average. Certainly, late last year, especially when iAds was first launched in the UK, ad revenue and CPM rates were at their peak.<p>However, by moving onto the Mac App Store at an early stage with popular apps, we have shifted from solely relying on large ad revenues as our income source to paid app income.

There are two very important issues to consider here.<p>1) One reason people like Java is reliability. Therefore adding Lambdas must not break any existing code at all. This includes no breaking changes to any part of the standard library.<p>2) As we can't make substantial changes to existing code, the lambdas we add have to fit well with existing code bases, without adding too many nasty corner cases to lambdas.<p>3) Once added, you can't ever make any changes to lambdas. This is a one-time opportunity. So you better get it exactly right, because you can't go back.<p>You say it is ""never urgent"" to make existing Java users rewrite their code. It is not ""never urgent"", it is a fundamental pillar of Java that users will never have to rewrite their code, and that is one of the major reasons that Java is so popular with business. You can argue that Java shouldn't make that decision, and should end up with something like the long drawn-out slow change to Python 3, or the Perl 6, but it was a conscious choice, not just something the developers can't be bothered to do.<p>Under those kinds of restrictions, I would argue adding lambdas to any system would be difficult. There were similar difficulties adding them to C++, and I would say in many ways Java is getting it better than C++ (but that is largely due to the much higher level of complexity of the C++ language).",1315585774

In these sports, it is very much about small fairly close-knit communities who adopt common vocabularies made up of technical terms and also (normally) a bunch of ""Americanisms"" to express their feelings.<p>I see tremendous similarities between the startup culture and the extreme sports culture. Both tend to reject conventional methods of rewarding people with ""status"" (i.e. family background) and focus instead on meritocratic measures like ability / performance. Issues like nationality tend to also become less relevant as people travel around frequently.  Thus it is not surprising and, is actually welcome, that a universal vocabulary has emerged to connect startup'ers wherever they might be based.<p>Of course, I accept that the author has a point about slavish imitation being a bad strategy.

I could switch to a provider that had stronger privacy features but I really love Dropbox's convenience and simplicity. So, I built a solution:<p>http://safeboxapp.com<p>The app takes files it finds in ~/Safebox and encrypts them using AES-256 and stores the files in a subfolder of ~/Dropbox. When it sees new encrypted files in that folder, it decrypts them back to ~/Safebox. From then on, changes in either folder are automatically synchronized. The filenames and folder names are encrypted as well.<p>From a user perspective, you simply use ~/Safebox instead of ~/Dropbox for files requiring extra security.<p>It's packaged as a Mac OS/X app (and soon as a Windows app).

In terms of Jewish culture, it's not really a secret that most of Hollywood, the media, and much of progressivism and culture in general is organized around liberal jewish values.<p>I'm not really an expert on why this is, but from what I can see protestantism sort of hit its high water mark shortly after WWII. Around this time we had an enormous rise in summer camps, spiritual retreats, folk music, sort of a pre-environmental movement, etc. that was all basically a reaction to the atomic bomb. Not to mention the birth of rock & roll, which came out of protestantism as well. All of this eventually led to the counter culture, which protestantism sort of pulled back from. These loosely affiliated movements were then basically embraced by liberal judaism. So today even though judaism proper is in the background, many of its values have still shaped those of the progressive movement to the point where liberal jewish values and progressivism are largely intertwined.<p>In terms of Japanification, one pretty clear example in schools is high stakes testing. In the workplace it's characterized by how bureaucratic large companies have become, and the way the people at the bottom are treated. I think it's in the movie The High Cost of Low Prices that there are videos of Wal-Mart employees doing their morning dance or whatever that corporate makes them do every day when they open the store, stuff like that is straight out of Japanese business culture. In general you see an increasing amount of abstract ideas being productized so that they can be sold as part of new fads, whether we're talking about rock band, credit default swaps, politicians, etc. It's essentially a glorification of surface appearances.<p>From everything I can see, the U.S. is basically becoming like Japan except without the ideas surround honor and the other spiritual norms, and without enough money to facilitate the same level of pop culture fads. Again I'm not a historian so if you want to call bullshit on me then go for it, I'm just calling it as I see it.",1315584922

6906875,comment,6906125,6906125,11,0,ggreer,,,"I noticed one important omission in this article: SSDs. All of the recommended laptops had 500GB hard drives. Modern SSDs are an order of magnitude faster than laptop hard drives in sequential reads/writes and two orders of magnitude faster in random access. Decent SSDs can easily saturate a 6gbps SATA III bus. They have latencies measured in microseconds. They are silent, shock-tolerant, and more energy efficient than hard drives.<p>Once you&#x27;ve switched to an SSD, any laptop with a hard drive will feel broken.

6906868,comment,6906125,6906287,3,0,schoen,,,"I was involved in some Windows Refund stuff in California.  Many manufacturers later added language to their marketing and packaging claiming that bundled software was an integral part of their product and could not be returned separately, nor resold separately.  If you tried to return it separately for a refund (as the Windows EULA text seemed to suggest), they would say that that was only an option if you returned the entire product.<p>So, my impression is that it&#x27;s actually become dramatically more difficult for most manufacturers because they&#x27;re specifically trying to prevent customers from getting a refund just for bundled copies of Windows.<p>I&#x27;ve imagined that some of these policies might violate (or be unenforceable because of) antitrust, consumer protection, or copyright laws in some jurisdictions, but I don&#x27;t know of specific cases where they&#x27;ve been challenged on these bases or what the results were.

Sorry for not making my point as clear as it should have been.<p>Essentially, this whole point that Windows laptops have no good ideas to be gleaned from and that Apple is God is making computers worse. I don&#x27;t use the Air because it represents everything I hate about Apple: locked-down, stripped-down, un-customizable, unconfigurable, and untenable. Yes, it&#x27;s damn pretty, but I don&#x27;t just want pretty. I want pretty, fast, and functional. The PowerBook, and later, the 2006/7/8-era MacBook Pros, represent everything I love about Apple: well-designed, comfortable, functional, easy to use, and post-purchase upgradable.<p>Apple used to produce machines that were like that, but ever  since Ive&#x27;s been at the omnipresent helm of hardware design, everything I used to love about Apple&#x27;s machines has gone down the river, so to speak. Yes, the new Mac Pro is exceptionally beautiful on a desk next to a huge 30&quot; 4K monitor, but it doesn&#x27;t have the functionality necessary to be called a Mac <i>Pro</i>. Studios need the expandability provided by PCI-e. TB still has too much latency to be able to be considered against true internal slot expansion. The Retina MacBook Pro is gorgeous, but it doesn&#x27;t have an optical drive, so putting your high-quality lossless media on it gets to be a pain. It also doesn&#x27;t have upgradable memory, or even a user-replaceable battery, two things that would be easily engineered if this &quot;0.02mm thinner is better&quot; mentality would die.<p>But, hey, you can&#x27;t please everyone. I bet I&#x27;m going to be that guy with a 20-year-old computer who&#x27;s running nothing but a shell and complaining about how the transparent, glass-screened, ultra-thin tablets of the future don&#x27;t have user-replaceable hard drives.",1387050950
6906862,comment,6906635,6906635,15,0,rayiner,,,"> our Roadmap conference in November, Om asked GE CMO Beth Comstock why a young person would want to work at GE when there are hot companies like Facebook out there. If there’s one compelling reason why anyone would want to, it’s because a company like GE can invest in R&D and tackle some of these massive, basic science, infrastructure and manufacturing problems. Because who’s more likely to deliver a jetpack, GE or Facebook?<p>It&#x27;s a little sad that this even needs to be pointed out. VC&#x27;s don&#x27;t have either the money or the time to fund huge, capital-intensive projects. If you think about the really big projects going on right now, most are backed by the government or big public corporations. Google&#x27;s self-driving cars. Tesla&#x27;s electric cars,[1] Space X&#x27;s low-cost launch vehicles,[2] etc.<p>The article mentions that VC works when Moore&#x27;s law is in operation. Ironically, the actual operation of Moore&#x27;s law at semi-conductor fabs isn&#x27;t funded by VC, but massive capital investment from Intel, IBM, TSMC, etc. To put things into perspective: Intel&#x27;s annual capital expenditures of $10-12 billion alone are roughly comparable to all VC investment in Silicon Valley combined (which is 40% of all VC investment in the U.S. as a whole).<p>[1] While Tesla paid off its federal loans early, it took $465 million for four years in order to build the factory that produces that Model S, arguably one of the most crucial turning points in the development of the company. Also, Tesla benefits enormously from the electric vehicle tax credit.<p>[2] Subsidized both by historical NASA research and NASA prepayments on launch contracts amounting to about half the money Space X has thus far raised.",1387050942

6906823,comment,6906125,6906125,1,0,loopasam,,,"The article shows that buying Windows with a laptop doesn&#x27;t cost you much more than no Windows at all. Based on this and my experience, I suggest to get a Windows first and install whatever Linux you like as dual-boot. The reasons are:<p>1) Having a Windows installed strongly guarantees that you are going to have a functional machine no matter what. Depending on your experience with Linux you might screw things up. If it happens you still have Windows as a back-up.<p>2) If your aim is to communicate research results, it is very likely that you are going to need to use Office at some point, to interact with your supervisor, colleagues, that don&#x27;t care about OS and just run Windows (the majority of people). You can use Office within Linux but I find it much easier to use directly from Windows (reduces the pipework and focus on the science).<p>3) It maybe no longer holds, but a few years ago it was really frustrating to use and connect machines running Linux on a projector. For instance let&#x27;s say you have to give a talk at a conference, you want to be 100% sure that it will work out of the box and that you don&#x27;t have to fiddle around to show your slides. Windows does that really well (drivers are primarily developed for it I guess) and allows you to focus on the presentation only (stressful enough). I&#x27;ve witnessed numerous times good science being badly communicated because of this issue, where people try to tune the resolution for 10 minutes before starting and the slides end-up being half-cropped.<p>In summary, dual-boots guarantees compatibility with the outside world (science research perspective), and you can use your Linux the rest of the time :-)",1387050438

When you&#x27;re paying e-trade $10, you&#x27;re paying for their marketing.<p>For those wondering why they can offer $0 commission, it&#x27;s because retail brokers actually <i>make</i> money on every trade you make. When you send your $10 through etrade or some other brokers, they don&#x27;t actually send your order to the market, they <i>sell</i> it to getco or some other market maker.<p>The reasons are complex and linked to NMS regulation. In short, there are two types of traders, informed and uninformed. Market makers do not want to trade with informed traders, because they tend to lose money on those trades. However, reg NMS mandates that every one gets the same best bid and offer. So the spreads you&#x27;ll see on the market reflect conditions where adverse selection is anticipated, which is why it&#x27;s very profitable to trade at those prices against uninformed flow.<p>Now why don&#x27;t brokers offer to pay rebates (less than $0) to customers? Well they&#x27;re not legally allowed to do that. The SEC regulates the maximum rebate and it&#x27;s not that big.<p>So why does Ameritrade for instance will charge you for trades?

I mean, if you&#x27;re just putting £100 on, you&#x27;ll wave goodbye to £10 for each trade you make. Even if you just buy one stock and sell it one year later that&#x27;s £20 gone plus any capital gains taxes.<p>I know the stock market is for people making long term investments with big lump sums, but for people at the bottom, the barrier to entry is too high",1387047717

Let&#x27;s say an advertising company offers eTrade 50-cents for info on every trade I make. That&#x27;s free money for eTrade right up until I, as the client, decide that&#x27;s intrusive and take my business elsewhere. Now eTrade is out my $10/trade, let alone the 50-cents.<p>But you don&#x27;t have that leverage with a free service. To them, (in the long run) making some money at the cost of pissing off their customers is better than making no money at all.",1387047697

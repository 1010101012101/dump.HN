So a common situation is to get an early cam rip of a movie, or an online-disabled version of a game, and then decide whether to go see it in the theater, or buy the full version.<p>Sometimes that kind of &quot;demo&quot; is not available though, so they&#x27;ll just take the plunge and pay for it, finding out whether it&#x27;s good or bad after the purchase, with no recourse available.<p>So, a leak is definitely bad for studios, because it&#x27;ll deprive them of sales to the impatient. On the other hand it&#x27;s good for consumers who would otherwise have wasted money.",1415440299

The American notion of these CEOs earning millions (and then getting extra millions in bonuses even when they screw up or are fired) is very foreign (as the article says, the company will keep you in style appropriate to your station, but in more subtle ways). The conglomerate pays everyone similarly, makes modest profits (which probably means that some parts of it are losing money big time, and subsidized by the profitable divisions - but it would be unthinkable to just close a division and fire everyone) and returns them to shareholders, who are at least perceived as being mostly ordinary folks saving for retirement.",1415439156

Far more open than Android, much closer to an old-school Linux distro even then some desktop distros, easy dev unlocking (and good tools!), and Palm/HP even used .ipk as their package format.  I loved my old Palm Pre and HP Touchpad until they both eventually died violent deaths (technically one still runs after a 5-story fall onto marble, but it&#x27;s not happy).   The homebrew community rather quickly got an X server working complete with a couple of common desktop environments.  Or rather I should say X servers plural, you could launch more than one and flick between them like any native app.<p>With a bluetooth keyboard and mouse I could work much more comfortably than with the exact same hardware running Cyanogenmod.  Being able to do Perl/Ruby development and run a real RDBMS is possible on Android, but it&#x27;s not natural.  When webOS came out GUI was also more pleasant than Android or iOS for a lot of things and definitely better at multitasking, but they couldn&#x27;t compete in the market.

As history shows, the Japanese took this margin and crushed American carmakers for decades; the pendulum is only recently swinging back (and that&#x27;s with government intervention to avoid US automaker collapse due to their own incompetence).<p>It&#x27;s not true, but that was a big driver of the sentiment.",1415437629

They have different patterns. It&#x27;s not the grid, Roman cities have that too, (check Turin in Italy). It&#x27;s the size of the roads, all the space used for cars&#x27; infrastructure, which separate buildings and makes those cities difficult to walk (first thought LA).<p>So an evolutionary theory of cities should take into account their environment, whether they are in symbiosis with something else (example: cars) or where they &quot;live&quot;, on the top of a hill or in a plain, and which constraints they must obey to (regulations, space, etc).<p>This is going to be interesting.",1415437515

Expendables 3 was also awful -- X-Men Wolverine was leaked very early on, and went on to do extremely well. How a leak affects ticket sales is pure speculation, I wish &#x27;journalists&#x27; would stop talking about the harm piracy does without any substantiation.",1415437450
